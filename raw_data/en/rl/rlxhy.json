Weightlessness takes a paradoxically heavy toll on astronauts who spend extended periods of time in zero gravity. A researcher at Rush is helping lead a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study that's trying to help make space travel easier on astronauts, and that also may yield insights into the progression, prevention and even possible cure of trauma-induced osteoarthritis for the rest of us here on Earth. [Susan Chubinskaya, PhD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/susan-chubinskaya-phd), the Klaus Kuettner Professor of Osteoarthritis Research at Rush, will work with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Alan Grodzinsky, ScD, a biomedical engineer, and Vicki Rosen, PhD, a developmental biologist at Harvard School of Dental Medicine, to test the effects of the \"microgravity\" of space on damaged knee and ankle cartilage. The study is one of the five 2017 Tissue Chips in Space Projects to be conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) United States National Laboratory, with funding from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), a branch of the NIH. \"We have been collaborating with MIT on multiple projects for more than 20 years. This new project is a natural extension of that partnership\" says Chubinskaya, whose own research focuses on how human joint tissue responds to injury. Under her supervision, Rush will provide human joints from organ donors for the project and will assist with culture experiments and analysis of tissue responses to injuries. Tissue Chips in Space is a collaboration between NCATS and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space, or [CASIS](https://www.iss-casis.org/about/about-the-iss-national-lab/), the nonprofit, nongovernmental organization that manages the ISS. The overall endeavor will investigate human physiology and disease aboard the ISS with an eye to improving the health of astronauts, who [lose bone mineral density](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/osteoporosis) if they are in microgravity for long, and are prone to joint injuries during their routine exercises while in orbit. \"They experience a lot of changes in their muscular skeletal system, and when they come back, it's not that simple to recover. They need treatment, and we need to understand what happens with the joints while they're up there,\" Chubinskaya says. While the other projects will employ tissue-chip technology \u2014 tiny models of human organs \u2014 the MIT-Rush collaboration on ISS will use dozens of small samples of human knee and ankle components known as osteochondral units, which contain cartilage and bone, along with synovial tissue, a type of connective tissue specific to joints. This model replicates the environment within knee and ankle joints. The samples will be contained in small culture tubes that will each spend a month in space (the scientists in the program will remain on the ground). Because of Rush's long relationship with [Gift of Hope](https://www.giftofhope.org/), the federally designated nonprofit agency that coordinates organ and tissue donation in parts of Illinois and Indiana, Rush has access to donated human joints for research. Osteoarthritis is the most common chronic condition of the joints and a leading cause of pain and disability among adults 60 and older. The condition, which can be disabling and expensive to treat, occurs when cartilage (connecting tissue) between joints breaks down. The bones then rub together, causing pain and stiffness. The cartilage can deteriorate for any of a number of reasons, including overuse or [obesity](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/obesity). Trauma (damage) to young people's joints in accidents or sports injuries also is a common and pernicious cause of osteoarthritis, and post-traumatic osteoarthritis will be the focus of the ISS experiments. The problem can take a dozen or more years to develop after an injury, but then can require [joint replacement](https://www.rush.edu/services/joint-replacement-surgery-program), and even multiple replacements for the same joint over an individual's lifetime. (A replacement joint may only last 10 to 15 years, and post-traumatic osteoarthritis occurs earlier in life than age-related spontaneous osteoarthritis.) Post-traumatic osteoarthritis accounts for [about 12 percent ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17106388?dopt=Abstract)of symptomatic osteoarthritis in hips, knees and ankles. The study's primary focus will be on the mechanisms of post-traumatic osteoarthritis and the effects of certain drugs on the disease course on Earth and in microgravity. \"We are trying to model joint injury in order to understand the processes responsible for joint deterioration both on Earth and in space.\" Chubinskaya says \"We want to find out how to slow down the progression of the disease, or even prevent it.\" In Chubinskaya's and Grodzinsky's labs, healthy donor joint cartilage is deliberately and forcefully injured. Then samples of the damaged cartilage and accompanying synovial tissue are steeped in a \"cocktail of cytokines, the inflammatory mediators we know are released as a result of this impaction,\" Chubinskaya says. The research team hopes to learn \"what controls the degradations\" in the tissue after injury, so they can home in on effective treatments. After developing the tissue culture model, the researchers will use it to test five treatment options, including anti-inflammatory small molecule drugs that suppress inflammation and growth factors that stimulate tissue repair and regeneration. \"The same approach then will be taken into space,\" Chubinskaya says. The researchers will have a chance to see how microgravity affects the progression of osteoarthritis and the effectiveness of the five treatments. The samples will be aboard the ISS for a month, currently planned to be this December. After they return to Earth, the researchers will analyze them for appearance and multiple biological markers of disease progression, just as they will have done for the samples tested in the Earth labs. They'll compare the results with the findings of the Earth experiments. \"The data may increase understanding of trauma-induced osteoarthritis in both conditions and for both the general public and astronauts,\" Chubinskya says.

Rush University is known for its high-quality health care education, supportive learning environment, engagement with the urban community and forward-looking education approach. A pioneer in Alzheimer's disease research, Denis Evans, MD, received a lifetime achievement award from the Alzheimer's Association. Denis Evans, MD, is unassuming about his research in [Alzheimer's disease](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/alzheimers-disease). He allows that he has contributed a \"recognizable piece\" of what is known about Alzheimer's. In truth, his work has been foundational in the battle against the devastating neurological disease of aging, which is the most common cause of dementia. The director of the Rush Institute for Healthy Aging for two decades, Evans has tracked Alzheimer's for more than a quarter century through population studies \u2014 that is, studies of a group within the general population \u2014 that have revealed the disease's troubling prevalence among the elderly and illuminated some of the characteristics and behaviors that can influence who develops Alzheimer's, and who doesn't. \"He's a pioneer in community-based studies in Alzheimer's Bennett, MD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/david-bennett-md), director of the [Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center](https://www.rush.edu/services/alzheimers-disease-center), who regards Evans as his mentor. Bennett adds that Evans' approximately 340 research publications are \"some of the most highly cited\" in field. Reflecting the importance of his contributions, Evans received the Bengt Winblad Lifetime Achievement Award in Alzheimer's Disease Research from the Alzheimer's Association in 2016. The Alla V. and Solomon Jesmer Professor of Medicine at Rush Medical College, Evans retired June 30 after 27 years at Rush and is being honored at a Sept. 5 celebration on the Rush campus. As a young researcher, Evans was part of the team from the Harvard University Medical School that showed in 1989 how widespread Alzheimer's is in the population \u2014 and how steeply its presence increases with age. Working through the East Boston Neighborhood Health Center, the primary source of health care for the neighborhood around Boston's Logan Airport, the researchers found that Alzheimer's prevalence increased with age. The researchers interviewed 81 percent of East Boston's residents aged 65 and older, more than 3,623 in all, and made a detailed clinical evaluation of a random sample of nearly 467. They found that 3 percent of people ages 65 to 74, 19 percent of ages 75 to 84, and 47 percent of those older than 85 had the disease. \"The disease was a good deal more common than people thought,\" Evans says. What Evans understood from his beginnings at Harvard, Bennet says, is that studying demented people who showed up at health care facilities would not uncover the causes of Alzheimer's, while many others who had the disease remained out of sight in their communities. Instead, Evans identified risk factors among the population as a whole, went door-to-door in a confined area to find all the clinically normal people on the brink of old age who lived there, followed up to observe which ones eventually became demented, and focused on the risk factors that had been noted in individuals who later lost cognitive functioning. One of Evans' great talents, Bennett says, has been the ability to \"design the right study to answer the questions.\" Bennett also explains that Evans took an unusual approach to Alzheimer's for a 20th-century researcher: He treated the disease as if it were a spectrum disorder. \"Denis understood very early on that there is no magic cut point for Alzheimer's disease,\" Bennett says. He realized the disease's presentation is different in every person who has it. \"It's taken all these decades for the field to catch up to him,\" Bennett says. Born and raised in Detroit, Evans attended Catholic University in Washington, D.C., and the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor. He started his medical research career in infectious diseases at Harvard University Medical School in Boston. As a junior fellow there, he agreed to help his mentor, Edward H. Kass, MD, PhD, conduct a population study around treatments for urinary tract infections. \"He'd been very good to me, and he hadn't asked me to do much, so I agreed to do it. Well, I fell in love with population-based research. My interests began to switch,\" Evans recalls. It took Evans another decade to turn fully away from infectious diseases. He kept encountering patients who \"were telling me they would rather be dead than have what is now called Alzheimer's disease. I thought, 'Well, that's important!'\" He came to Rush in 1990, attracted by its research reputation, its established cohorts, and by the city of Chicago. It was one of perhaps four metropolitan areas, he figures, where he could conduct a population study he had in mind. In Chicago, Evans found the \"level of trust and cooperation\" and the diverse communities in close proximity to one another that made it possible to explore differences in how Alzheimer's affects different ethnic groups. That enterprise became the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a study of the chronic health problems of the elderly \u2014 especially of possible risk factors for Alzheimer's \u2014 in an area on the far South Side with both white and African-American residents. A longitudinal population study, meaning it observed the same subjects repeatedly over time, CHAP began in 1993 over the next 20 years canvassed about 70 percent of the people in the Mount Greenwood, Morgan Park and Washington Heights neighborhood \u2014 more than 10,000 people in all. \"The CHAP study has been important in estimating the number of people who have Alzheimer's disease in the general population, in energizing methodical investigation of the disease among African Americans, and in uncovering several factors that give rise to increased risk of the condition,\" Evans says. Evans' work with CHAP has continued since the study ended in 2012. He is the principal investigator of the Genetic Epidemiology of Cognitive Decline in an Aging Population Sample study, which is investigating the genetics of late-life cognitive decline using data from two large cohort studies \u2014 CHAP and the Indianapolis-Ibadan Dementia Project, a comparative study of African-Americans in Indianapolis and Yoruba in Nigeria. The study has helped delineate the genetic architecture of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline among African Americans and in comparing these finding to those of European Americans. When Evans first came to Rush, Bennett recalls, \"there was very little research on Alzheimer's disease happening\" there. Thanks to his skill at writing successful grant applications to the National Institutes of Health and his willingness to share what he knew, Rush quickly became a major Alzheimer's research institution. \"By 1991, we had a center funded by the National Institute on Aging,\" Bennett says. \"By 1993, he had CHAP and other grants, and he had a big coattail effect on research across the institution.\" While understanding of Alzheimer's disease has increased exponentially during Evans' career, a cure for it still remains elusive. Whatever progress will be made in conquering Alzheimer's disease in the near future will likely come from prevention rather than a cure. Otherwise, if we live long enough, \"most of us will develop Alzheimer's disease,\" Evans says, since medical science is extending lifespans in developed countries. \"There's more frustration than good news,\" Evans acknowledges. \"It would help if there were only a few factors that account for a lot of the disease, but Alzheimer's is turning out to be very complex, and complexity is the enemy. \"We will eventually have success, but it won't be tomorrow,\" he says. As Evans' own achievements have shown, a solution to the disease requires being in the fight for the long term. For media inquries, please contact [deb_song@rush.edu](mailto:deb_song@rush.edu). The Training Research-Literate Chaplains program announced its first chaplain research fellows and curriculum development grant recipients (Chicago) The Training Research-Literate Chaplains as Ambassadors for Spirituality and Health program announced the selection of its first cohort of chaplain research fellows and of the first recipients of the program's clinical pastoral education curriculum development grants. The fellowships and grants are part of Training Research-Literate Chaplains' efforts to advance knowledge about religion and health in health care organizations and among the public. The Training Research-Literate Chaplains program is a joint effort by the Department of Health, Religion and Human Values at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and the Department of Sociology at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. The project seeks to close the gap between hospital chaplains' current limited research literacy and the importance of evidence-based care for all members of the health care team. \"Health care chaplains have embraced the importance of evidence-based practice but lack the training to realize it,\" said program co-leader [George Fitchett, DMin, PhD](http://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/george-fitchett-dmin-phd), professor and director of research in the Rush Department of Religion, Health and Human Values. \"More interdisciplinary collaboration and a growing understanding of how religion and spirituality can positively affect patient health means hospital chaplains are increasingly important members of a patient's care team.\" The fellowships will pay for 16 board-certified chaplains to complete a two-year, research-focused Master of Science or Master of Public Health degree in epidemiology, biostatistics or public health at an accredited school of public health. Selected from among a competitive pool, the first cohort of eight fellows are gathering for a kickoff conference from July 27 to 29 at Rush. The conference will bring together the fellows and members of the Training Research-Literate Chaplains' leadership and advisory committees to open the conversations on chaplaincy research. The clinical pastoral education (CPE) grants will be given to 70 CPE programs - which provide the training required to be a hospital chaplain \u2014 to incorporate research literacy into their curricula. The first cohort consists of 38 centers and will reach 237 student health care chaplains. The Training Research-Literate Chaplains' third initiative, a free, online education for chaplains entitled \"Religion, Spirituality and Health: An Introduction to Research,\" will be made available in 2017 at no cost to practicing chaplains who are members of the supporting professional chaplaincy organizations. \"We are thrilled with the opportunities this program is offering to chaplains with a range of backgrounds and experiences,\" said Wendy Cadge, PhD, program co-leader and professor of sociology at Brandeis. \"The first group of fellows and CPE centers will do much to bridge the gaps between chaplains and other members of the healthcare team. We are grateful to the John Templeton Foundation and the sponsoring chaplaincy organizations for giving all of us this opportunity.\" The Training Research-Literate Chaplains program is funded by $4.5 million in grants from the John Templeton Foundation with additional support from the Association of Professional Chaplains, the Association of Clinical Pastoral Education, the National Association of Catholic Chaplains, and Neshama - Association of Jewish Chaplains. The first cohort of chaplain research fellows includes the following members: The CPE programs at the following institutions are the recipients of the first round of clinical pastoral education grants: For more information about the Training Research-Literate Chaplains as Ambassadors for Spirituality and Health program, please contact [kathryn_lyndes@rush.edu](mailto:Kathryn_Lyndes@rush.edu).

Eating cinnamon might improve learning ability, according to a new study by Rush University Medical Center neuroscientists. By Deb Song Cinnamon is a delicious addition to toast, coffee and breakfast rolls. Eating the tasty household spice also might improve learning ability, according to new study results published online in the July issue of the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology. The study by neurological scientists at Rush University Medical Center found that feeding cinnamon to laboratory mice determined to have poor learning ability made the mice better learners. \"This would be one of the safest and the easiest approaches to convert poor learners to good learners,\" said [Kalipada Pahan, PhD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/kalipada-pahan-phd), the lead researcher of the study and the Floyd A. Davis Professor of Neurology at Rush. Some people are born naturally good learners, some become good learners by effort, and some find it hard to learn new tasks even with effort. Little is known about the neurological processes that cause someone to be a poor learner and how to improve performance in poor learners. \"Understanding brain mechanisms that lead to poor learning is important to developing effective strategies to improve memory and learning ability,\" Pahan said. The key to gaining that understanding lies in the hippocampus, a small part in the brain that generates, organizes and stores memory. Researchers have found that the hippocampus of poor learners has less CREB (a protein involved in memory and learning) and more alpha5 subunit of GABAA receptor or GABRA5 (a protein that generates tonic inhibitory conductance in the brain) than good learners. The mice in the study received oral feedings of ground cinnamon, which their bodies metabolized into sodium benzoate, a chemical used as a drug treatment for brain damage. When the sodium benzoate entered the mice's brains, it increased CREB, decreased GABRA5, and stimulated the plasticity (ability to change) of hippocampal neurons. These changes in turn led to improved memory and learning among the mice. \"We have successfully used cinnamon to reverse biochemical, cellular and anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with poor learning,\" Pahan said. The researchers used a Barnes maze, a standard elevated circular maze consisting of 20 holes, to identify mice with good and bad learning abilities. After two days of training, the mice were examined for their ability to find the target hole. They tested the mice again after one month of cinnamon feeding. The researchers found that after eating their cinnamon, the poor learning mice had improved memory and learning at a level found in good learning mice. However, they did not find any significant improvement among good learners by cinnamon. \"Individual difference in learning and educational performance is a global issue,\" Pahan said. \"We need to further test this approach in poor learners. If these results are replicated in poor learning students, it would be a remarkable advance.\" Cinnamon has been a sweet spot for Pahan's research. He and his colleagues previously that [cinnamon](https://www.rush.edu/news/press-releases/cinnamon-may-help-halt-parkinsons-disease-progression) can reverse changes in the brains of mice with [Parkinson's disease](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/parkinsons-disease). These studies have made the researchers spice connoisseurs: They used mass spectrometric analysis to identify the purer of the two major types of cinnamon widely available in the United States \u2014 Chinese cinnamon (Cinnamonum cassia) and original Ceylon cinnamon. \"Although both types of cinnamon are metabolized into sodium benzoate, we have seen that Ceylon cinnamon is much more pure than Chinese cinnamon, as the latter contains coumarin, a hepatotoxic (liver damaging) molecule,\" Pahan said. The study of cinnamon and learning ability was supported by grants from National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Alzheimer's Association. Interactions among researchers, clinicians and patients are critical to inspiring tomorrow's biomedical discoveries. By Mark Donahue Collaborations are critical to biomedical research. It's through a spirit of discussion and passionate focus that researchers sustain themselves in work that can take decades, through the ups and downs of sponsored funding, in the lab and sometimes far afield. Collaborative studies are on the rise in general, with partnerships at Rush alone emerging around microbiology and immunology, [Alzheimer's](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/research/departmental-research/rush-alzheimers-disease-center) and [HIV](https://www.rush.edu/services/hiv-treatment-program), and work on bone and cartilage, said Tom Wilson, assistant vice president of research affairs. And this cross-disciplinary work is drawing more attention \u2014 and support \u2014 from government and private funding agencies. \"Not too many years ago, most research faculty would kind of be in a silo,\" said Wilson. \"And they're doing what they do isolated in their laboratory, and they were getting funding for that research. But now sponsors' expectations have changed, and they want to see integrated, collaborative research projects.\" The medication Ampyra \u2014 also known by its generic name dalfampridine \u2014 was born out of a collaboration among Rush clinical and basic science researchers that started more than 30 years ago. Ampyra is used to treat [multiple sclerosis (MS)](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/multiple-sclerosis), an insidious disease that affects more than 2 million people worldwide. In MS, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks myelin in the brain and spinal cord without an identifiable cause or cure. For many sufferers, symptoms such as impaired eyesight, speech and muscle function become a fact of daily life. Ampyra is a potassium channel blocker, which enhances signaling in nerves damaged by MS, allowing patients to live more normal lives. Licensed for use in 2010, Ampyra remains the only FDA-approved therapy recognized to improve walking in MS patients. The initial spark that led to the discovery of Ampyra dates back to the 1960s, when Floyd Davis, MD, then a neurologist in training and later a physician at Rush, observed that many [multiple sclerosis](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/multiple-sclerosis) patients functioned better when their body temperature was slightly lowered. That raised the possibility that MS-damaged nerve fibers do not permanently lose the ability to transmit signals, as many before had thought. In 1978, Davis teamed up with another Rush clinical researcher, [Dusan Stefoski, MD](https://doctors.rush.edu/details/1587), and they concentrated on finding a compound that could mimic some of the effects of lower body temperature. Their research led them to the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine, 4-AP or dalfampridine. Two years later, the team led by Davis published a paper on the scientific foundations of their work, and they began clinical trials in 1983. The results were immediate: Taken intravenously, 4-AP produced transient improvements in MS patients' motor and eyesight functions. In 1990, Rush initially licensed the proprietary know-how developed by Davis and Stefoski to a pharmaceutical company. When the company did not actively develop the drug, Rush looked for a new commercial partner. In 2003, the hospital signed a new license agreement with Acorda Therapeutics, which successfully completed the clinical development of what ultimately became Ampyra. The FDA approved Ampyra in 2010 as an extended release tablet form, followed by regulatory approvals in the European Union and Australia. From its launch until mid-2014, Rush (and its inventors) received a running royalty on sales of Ampyra. Rush sold its royalty rights to a private equity fund in August 2014 for about $42 million, and it has used large portions of the proceeds to fund other research. Today the [Rush Multiple Sclerosis Center](https://www.rush.edu/services/multiple-sclerosis-center) is continuing its work, studying whether Ampyra can help nerves restore the myelin coating stripped away by MS and if long-term use of the drug could gradually improve muscle function, much like athletic training. Bob Eisenberg, chairman emeritus of the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Physiology, has been at Rush since 1976 and recalls the excitement around the Ampyra team's initial breakthrough. One of the department's then-researchers, Charles Schauf, PhD, offered some early thoughts to Davis and Stefoski on the science behind ion channel blockade. For Eisenberg, it's a perfect example of how conversations that happen across disciplines are critical to research \u2014 in this case, the contribution of basic science to addressing foundational questions. \"There are things going on like that at the early stage right now,\" Eisenberg said. \"We don't know which one of them is going to work. We don't know where the interaction with the clinician may be helpful, here or somewhere else. It's a community effort.\" Older people with higher amounts of a key protein in their brains had slower decline in their memory and thinking abilities than people with lower amounts of the protein, according to a study led by neurological researchers from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center at Rush University Medical Center. By: Deb Song Older people with higher amounts of a key protein in their brains had slower decline in their memory and thinking abilities than people with lower amounts of the protein, according to a study led by neurological researchers from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center at Rush University Medical Center. The results of the study were published in the January 27, 2016, online issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The researchers compared the degree of cognitive decline in study participants with the levels of the protein created by expression of the gene brain-derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF for short. The protein aids the survival of neurons (nerve cells) in the brain and helps stimulate development of new ones. \"This relationship was strongest among the people with the most signs of Alzheimer's disease pathology in their brains,\" said Dr. Aron S. Buchman, principal investigator of the study and professor of neurological sciences at Rush. \"It suggests that a higher level of BDNF protein may provide a buffer, or reserve, for the brain and protect individuals against the effects of the plaques and tangles that accumulate in the brain as a part of Alzheimer's disease.\" Cognitive decline slowed by half for some For the study, 535 people with an average age of 81 were followed until death, a period that averaged six years. During this time, the study participants took yearly tests of their thinking and memory skills. After their death, a neurologist reviewed their records and determined whether they had dementia; some memory and thinking problems, called mild cognitive impairment; or no thinking and memory problems. Autopsies were conducted on their brains after death, and the amount of BDNF protein in the brain then was measured. The participants were part of the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study. The rate of cognitive decline was about 50 percent slower for those with the highest 10 percent of BDNF protein found compared to those with the lowest 10 percent. In addition, the effect of plaques and tangles in the brain on cognitive decline was reduced on people with high levels of BDNF. Thus, for two individuals with high levels of AD pathology in their brains, , the rate of cognitive decline was about 40 percent slower in people with the highest amount of BDNF protein in their brains compared to those with the lowest amount. On average, thinking and memory skills declined by about 0.10 units per year on the tests. Higher levels of BDNF protein reduced the effect of plaques and tangles in the brain on cognitive decline by 0.02 units per year. The researchers found that the plaques and tangles in the brain accounted for 27 percent of the variation in cognitive decline, demographics accounted for 3 percent and BDNF protein accounted for 2 percent. While past efforts have focused on developing treatments which prevent AD pathology or increase its removal, the current study suggest a new approach. Therapies targeting BDNF expression might one day provide a second alternative which focus on protective therapies which prevent the effects of AD pathology. We need to examine this relationship Michal Schnaider Beeri, PhD, of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, noted in an accompanying editorial that exercise has been shown to increase levels of BDNF protein in the blood, but that the relationship between BDNF protein levels in the blood and in the brain is not clear. \"More research is needed to confirm these findings, determine how this relationship between protein produced by BDNF gene expression and cognitive decline works and see if any strategies can be used to increase BDNF in the brain to protect or slow the rate of cognitive decline,\" Buchman said. Buchman noted that the study does not prove that BDNF protein is the cause of a slower rate of cognitive decline. Further work is needed to determine if activities which increase brain BDNF gene expression levels protect or slow the rate of cognitive decline in old age. The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health, Illinois Department of Public Health and the Robert C. Borwell Endowment Fund. ### Rush is a not-for-profit healthcare, education and research enterprise located in Chicago comprising Rush University Medical Center, Rush University, Rush Oak Park Hospital and Rush Health.
