The NCC says: \"The Natural Capital Protocol is a framework designed to help generate trusted, credible, and actionable information for business managers to inform decisions. The Protocol aims to support better decisions by including how we interact with nature, or more specifically [natural capital](http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/natural-capital/). Until now, natural capital has for the most part been excluded from decisions and, when included has been largely inconsistent, open to interpretation, or limited to moral arguments. The Protocol responds by offering a standardized framework to identify, measure, and value impacts and dependencies on natural capital.\" Access "}
