It protects neuron and microvascular endothelial cells against hypoxia/ischemia both <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> however the mechanism is not fully known. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is ubiquitously expressed in all types of tissue in the human body and serves important physiological functions due to its glucose uptake ability. The present study evaluated the role of Tan 2A in regulating GLUT1 expression and its potential mechanism. RTPCR and western Blot were used to detect the expression of GLUT1. Si RNA mediated knockdown and CHIP assay were used to explore the mechanism of Tan 2A on GLUT1expression. Tan 2A treatment induced expression of GLUT1 and subsequently increased glucose uptake in endothelial cells (ECs). Furthermore, mRNA expression levels of vascular endothelial cell growth factor, BCL2 interacting protein 3 and enolase 2, which are target genes for hypoxiainducible factor1 (HIF1), were significantly upregulated by Tan 2A. Coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that Tan 2A markedly increased the association of HIF1 with recombination signalbinding protein for immunoglobulin J region (RBPJ). Moreover, knockdown of HIF1 and RBPJ significantly reversed the regulatory effect of Tan 2A on mRNA expression levels of these genes in ECs. The results of the present study suggested that HIF1 partially mediated the regulatory effect of Tan 2A on GLUT1 expression in ECs.

The mammalian brain depends on glucose as its main source of energy but lacks oxygen and glucose reserves and therefore requires a continuous supply of glucose from blood ( [1](#b1-mmr-26-05-12844)). Two independent groups of transporter proteins, glucose transporters (GLUTs) and solute carrier family members, mediate glucose transport into the brain ( [2](#b2-mmr-26-05-12844)). GLUT protein 1 (GLUT-1), also called solute carrier family 2 member 1, was first identified in a fetal skeletal muscle cell line ( [3](#b3-mmr-26-05-12844)) and is ubiquitously expressed in all types of tissue ( [4](#b4-mmr-26-05-12844)). It is also reported to be highly expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) of the central nervous system and is considered to be the principal glucose transporter of the blood-brain barrier ( [5](#b5-mmr-26-05-12844)). Functional deficiency of GLUT-1 decreases the amount of glucose available to brain cells, which affects brain function ( [6](#b6-mmr-26-05-12844)). Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge), a medicinal herb, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat conditions associated with the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems, such as stroke ( [7](#b7-mmr-26-05-12844)). Tanshinones are the primary active component of IIA (Tan 2A), the most abundant a natural inhibitor of monoacylglycerol lipase, is a fat-soluble component and is reported to anti-inflammation, anti-cancer, neuroprotection and hypolipidemic activity ( [8](#b8-mmr-26-05-12844), [9](#b9-mmr-26-05-12844)), and have a neuroprotective and cardiovascular protective effect. Tan 2A increases blood flow in the heart and improves myocardial metabolic disorder by increasing the tolerance of cardiomyocytes to hypoxia ( [10](#b10-mmr-26-05-12844)). Tan 2A protects neuron and microvascular ECs hypoxia/ischemia both in vitro and in [11](#b11-mmr-26-05-12844)). Tan 2A sodium sulfonate by inhibiting expression of intracellular chloride channel 1 in ECs ( [12](#b12-mmr-26-05-12844)) factor 4 in [14](#b14-mmr-26-05-12844)). The combination of Danshen and Sanqi (a Chinese herbal medicine) prescription has been reported to markedly increase expression of liver glycogen synthesis genes, such as GLUT-1, and improve fat and glucose metabolism ( [15](#b15-mmr-26-05-12844)). To the best of our knowledge, however, whether GLUT-1 expression of ECs is regulated by Tan 2A is not yet known. It was hypothesized that Tan 2A may induce glucose uptake via regulation of GLUT1 expression in vascular ECs. Previous studies have reported that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) may mediate the therapeutic actions of Tan 2A ( [16](#b16-mmr-26-05-12844), [17](#b17-mmr-26-05-12844)). For example, Tan 2A is reported to inhibit breast cancer growth by inhibiting HIF-1 expression via the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway ( [18](#b18-mmr-26-05-12844)). Tan 2A also blocks epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cell lines by regulating the HIF-1 signaling pathway ( [19](#b19-mmr-26-05-12844)). Tan 2A decreases the inflammatory response in LPS-induced lung injury via the HIF-1 signaling pathway ( [20](#b20-mmr-26-05-12844)). Furthermore, overexpression of GLUT-1 enhances the effect of Tan 2A on the treatment of middle cerebral artery occlusion ( [21](#b21-mmr-26-05-12844)). The present study assessed the regulatory effect of Tan 2A on expression of GLUT-1 in ECs and evaluated whether the effect of Tan 2A was associated with HIF-1.

The protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). A total of 20 \u00b5g/lane protein sample was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred with 5% BSA (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd) for 1 h at room temperature, and probed with the aforementioned antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by incubation with the corresponding secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the membranes were washed with TBS-Tween (0.1%) three times, 10 min each. The blots were visualized using Clarity Western ECL Substrate (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). GAPDH was used as an internal reference. Densitometry analysis was performed using ImageJ (V1.8.0.112; National Institutes of Health). [] Glucose uptake assay Glucose uptake assay was performed using the Colorimetric Glucose Uptake Assay kit (Abcam) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) was added to HUVECs and incubated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C. After 2-DG was taken up by glucose transporters and metabolized to 2-DG-6-phosphate, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove exogenous 2-DG. Cells were lysed using repeated pipetting, freeze/thaw and heating at 85\u00b0C for 40 min.

Cells were harvested in cold PBS. The cellular nuclear pellets were resuspended with sonication buffer. The resulting cell suspension was sheared by sonication (MiSonix Sonicator 3000) on ice using 30/30-sec on/off for 10 min (Output Power: 4). ChIP assay was performed using 1.5 \u00b5g Rabbit bounded to the Magnetic Protein G beads. Each IP requires the addition of 500 \u00b5l Dilution Buffer.

[] Results [] [] Tan 2A increases GLUT-1 expression and glucose uptake in HUVECs To assess the effect of Tan 2A on GLUT-1 expression, HUVECs, a commonly used model for ECs ( [24](#b24-mmr-26-05-12844)), were treated with Tan 2A at 0, 15 and 30 \u00b5M for 24 h and 15 \u00b5M for 24 and 36 h. RT-qPCR results demonstrated that mRNA expression levels of GLUT-1 in HUVECs exposed to 15 \u00b5M Tan 2A increased significantly at 24 and 36 h compared with 0 h control ( [Fig. 1A](#f1-mmr-26-05-12844)). The relative mRNA expression levels of GLUT-1 increased significantly to 3.18\u00b10.32 and 3.65\u00b10.51 following 15 and 30 \u00b5M treatment for 24 h, respectively, compared with the 0 h control. And ( [Fig. 1B](#f1-mmr-26-05-12844)). Furthermore, GLUT-1 protein expression levels were assessed using western blotting. The protein expression levels were consistent with the mRNA expression levels of GLUT-1, also exhibiting upregulation ( [Fig. 1C and D](#f1-mmr-26-05-12844)). Moreover, endothelial glucose uptake was assessed using glucose analog 2-DG. Glucose uptake in HUVECs was significantly enhanced by Tan 2A compared with ( [Fig. western blotting ( [Fig. 1F, G](#f1-mmr-26-05-12844)), there was a significant decrease compared with the scrambled siRNA. GLUT-1 knockdown significantly decreased the promotive effect of Tan 2A on glucose uptake compared to the scrambled siRNA control ( [Fig. 1H](#f1-mmr-26-05-12844)). These result demonstrated that Tan 2A induced expression of GLUT-1 and thus promoted glucose uptake in HUVECs. Figure 1. Tan 2A increases expression of GLUT-1 in HUVECs.

[] Tan 2A induces expression of GLUT-1 via HIF-1 in HUVECs RNAseq was used to evaluate the potential mechanisms of the aforementioned effect of Tan 2A in HUVECs. Gene Ontology analysis demonstrated that 'response to was induced by Tan 2A ( [Fig. 2A](#f2-mmr-26-05-12844)). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis demonstrated that genes were markedly enriched in 'HIF-1 signaling pathway' ( [Fig. 2B](#f2-mmr-26-05-12844)). Furthermore, RNA-seq analysis demonstrated seven were differentially expressed (>1.5 fold) in 'HIF-1 signaling ( [Fig. results of the RNAseq were evaluated using RT-qPCR. There were significant increases in mRNA expression levels of VEGF, BNIP3 and ENO2 following treatment with Tan 2A the control ( [Fig. 2D-F](#f2-mmr-26-05-12844)). Knockdown demonstrated that Tan 2A-induced protein expression of GLUT-1 was also significantly reversed by HIF-1 knockdown ( [Fig. 2L](#f2-mmr-26-05-12844)). These results suggested that regulated GLUT-1 expression in HUVECs via the HIF-1 signaling pathway. Figure 2. Effect of Tan 2A on transcriptional activity of HIF-1 in HUVECs.

Tan Receptor for AGE; stem cell (SC). [] Tan 2A increases HRE activity in HUVECs To assess regulation of HIF-1 by Tan 2A in HUVECs, luciferase reporter assay was performed using constructs with the regulatory region of the HRE. The HRE displayed significantly increased luciferase activity in response to Tan 2A compared with the control ( [Fig. 3A](#f3-mmr-26-05-12844)). ChIP assay was performed to assess the regulatory effect of Tan 2A on the binding ability of HIF-1 to the potential HRE within the promoter region of the GLUT-1 gene and demonstrated that binding of HIF-1 to the promoter region of GLUT-1 gene was significantly enhanced by Tan 2A of EGL-9 family hypoxia inducible factor 3 (EGLN3), which belongs to prolyl hydroxylase family, compared with the control, these data suggested that EGLN3 mediated Tan 2A-induced activation of HIF-1 in HUVECs 3C](#f3-mmr-26-05-12844)). showed Tan induced HIF-1/HRE pathway in HUVECs. Figure 3. Tan 2A induces binding of HIF-1 to the HRE in the GLUT-1 promoter.

Whether RBPJ mediates Tan 2A-regulated therefore examined. RT-qPCR demonstrated that knockdown of RBPJ significantly inhibited Tan 4A-D](#f4-mmr-26-05-12844)). 2A markedly decreased protein expression levels of GLUT-1, as demonstrated by western blotting ( [Fig. 4E](#f4-mmr-26-05-12844)). These data suggested that RBPJ expression in HUVECs. Figure 4. Knockdown of RBPJ decreases expression of HIF-1 target genes induced by Tan 2A.

[] Tan 2A enhances the interaction between HIF-1 and RBPJ protein It has been reported that RBPJ physically interacts with HIF protein ( [27](#b27-mmr-26-05-12844)). Whether Tan 2A regulates coupling between HIF-1 and RBPJ was assessed. Western blotting of Co-IP samples demonstrated that HIF-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with RBPJ, which suggested a physical interaction between the proteins. Furthermore, Tan 2A treatment markedly enhanced the physically interaction of RBPJ with HIF-1 ( [Fig. 5](#f5-mmr-26-05-12844)). Figure 5. Tan 2A induces protein interaction between HIF-1 and RBPJ. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with Tan 2A or DMSO for 16 h.

[] Discussion Under both normal and pathological conditions, the concentration of glucose in neurons is strictly controlled and relies on sustained blood flow and glucose transport ( [28](#b28-mmr-26-05-12844)). Therefore, altered expression of GLUT-1 at the blood-brain barrier affects the function of neurons. In the present study, Tan 2A regulated GLUT-1 expression and glucose uptake in HUVECs. Furthermore, Tan 2A enhanced the interaction between HIF-1 and RBPJ and HIF-1 and RBPJ mediated the effect of Tan 2A on mRNA and protein expression levels of GLUT-1. These results suggested that Tan 2A may facilitate recovery of brain function via upregulation of the GLUT-1 to increase glucose absorption. The energy demand of neurons in the brain is served by glucose transported from the blood. Glucose is transported into brain cells via members of the GLUT family. GLUT-3 is primarily expressed in neurons, while GLUT-1 gene expression is limited to ECs in the healthy brain ( [29](#b29-mmr-26-05-12844)) and regulates glucose transport into the brain ( [31](#b31-mmr-26-05-12844)). Two subtypes of GLUT-1, a 55 in brain ECs and a 45 kDa isoform in adjacent astrocytes, have been reported previously ( [32](#b32-mmr-26-05-12844)). Previous studies have reported that changes in expression of GLUT affect the function of neurons and that GLUT-1 haploid deficiency induces decreased brain weight, activated astrocytosis, impaired motor performance and diminished brain glucose metabolism in mice ( [28](#b28-mmr-26-05-12844), [33](#b33-mmr-26-05-12844)). Our results showed that Tan 2A upregulated GLUT-1 expression and 2-DG uptake in HUVECs. In addition to its role in transporting glucose into the brain ( [34](#b34-mmr-26-05-12844)), GLUT-1 is needed for maintenance of proper brain capillary networks, blood flow and blood-brain barrier integrity ( [35](#b35-mmr-26-05-12844)). Furthermore, inhibition of GLUT-1 decreases EC glucose uptake and glycolysis, which leads to energy depletion, activation of the cellular energy sensor AMPK and decreased EC proliferation ( [5](#b5-mmr-26-05-12844)), as well nitric oxide-dependent endothelial relaxation ( [36](#b36-mmr-26-05-12844)). Tan 2A is used in the treatment of cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders, such as coronary heart disease and infarction effects via regulation of the expression of numerous molecules, including transcription factors, scavenger receptors, ion channels, pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, growth factors, inflammatory mediators and microRNAs ( [38](#b38-mmr-26-05-12844)). Tan 2A protects treatment combined with overexpression of GLUT-1 increases glucose uptake and thus promotes viability of neurons and recovery of brain function ( [42](#b42-mmr-26-05-12844)). It has also been reported that treatment with Danshen and Sanqi (a kind of Chinese herbal medicine) ameliorates hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia phenotypes in mice with diet-induced obesity via regulation of liver glycogen synthesis and cholesterol anabolism genes, including GLUT-1 ( [15](#b15-mmr-26-05-12844)). The present study demonstrated that Tan 2A significantly increased GLUT-1 mRNA and markedly increased GLUT-1 protein expression levels in HUVECs. Therefore, Tan 2A may serve as an adjuvant drug to treat GLUT-1-associated neuron disorder. HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor comprising an and subunit. Its activity is dependent on the stability of HIF-1. It is relatively stable under hypoxia and interacts with to form the HIF-1 HIF-1 considered to partly by reprogramming cellular metabolism ( [43](#b43-mmr-26-05-12844)). The expression via binding to the enhancer sequence located HRE in these genes. Our results showed that Tan 2A increased the activity of HRE of HIF-1 and the expression of VEGFA and GLUT-1. 2A decreases astrocyte proliferation HIF-1 and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12, which blocks downstream signaling via Erk1/2 and Akt activation. By contrast with previous reports that Tan 2A inhibits transcription of HIF-1 in tumor cells, the present study demonstrated an increase in HIF-1 mRNA and protein expression levels in Tan 2A-treated HUVECs and that the binding of HIF-1 to the HRE in GLUT-1 promotor sequence was induced by Tan 2A. But how the Tan 2A activate the HIF-1 is still underdetermined. And whether Tan 2A interacts with HIF-1 or DNA sequences in target genes is not known. Previous studies have reported Tan 2A is a natural monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) the MAGL binding ( [47](#b47-mmr-26-05-12844)). Furthermore, it has been reported that imidazole-based Tan 2A derivatives improve the selectivity and binding affinity with G-quadruplex DNA and enhances inhibition of breast cancer metastasis ( [48](#b48-mmr-26-05-12844)). The present study further demonstrates that HIF-1 partially mediated the regulatory effect of Tan 2A on GLUT-1 expression in ECs. The DNA binding transcription factor RBPJ, a key mediator of Notch signaling, recruits additional co-factors, including mastermind proteins 1-3, to activate target genes. RBPJ is also a putative cofactor of HIF-1 ( [27](#b27-mmr-26-05-12844)). The association of RBPJ with the HIF-1 complex promotes expression of replication and transcriptional activators ( [49](#b49-mmr-26-05-12844)). HIF-1 and HIF-2 competitively bind to the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor, an RBPJ partner, and dynamically regulate activation of Notch signaling in glioma stem cells ( [50](#b50-mmr-26-05-12844)). However, RBPJ may control gene expression of angiogenic factors by antagonizing the activity of HIF-1 ( [27](#b27-mmr-26-05-12844)). Deficiency of RBPJ in mice leads to activation of HIF-1-mediated regulation of Notch targets in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells ( [51](#b51-mmr-26-05-12844)). The present study demonstrated that RBPJ and HIF-1 knockdown both significantly reversed Tan 2A-induced mRNA expression levels of GLUT-1 and markedly decreased protein expression levels of GLUT-1 in HUVECs. Furthermore, Tan 2A markedly increased binding of HIF-1 and RBPJ. It was therefore hypothesized that RBPJ affects binding of HIF-1 to the HRE in the GLUT-1 promotor and that both RBPJ and HIF-1 may be involved in regulation of GLUT-1 gene expression induced by Tan 2A. Whether Tan 2A plays the same role under anoxic conditions is still to be studied. In summary, the present study suggested that Tan 2A induced expression of GLUT-1 via the HIF-1 signaling pathway ( [Fig. 6](#f6-mmr-26-05-12844)). Furthermore, Tan 2A may ameliorate brain glucose metabolism by regulating GLUT-1 mediated glucose transport in HUVECs. Figure 6.
