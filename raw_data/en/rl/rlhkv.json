By using our site, you accept our [ Websites Privacy Policy](https://nyulangone.org/policies-disclaimers/websites-privacy-policy). We have vaccination sites throughout New York City and on Long Island. NYU Langone offers the COVID-19 vaccine to our patients age 6 months and older. To learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine safety, read our [COVID-19 vaccine information for patients](/locations/covid-19-vaccine/covid-19-vaccine-information-for-patients). NYU Langone patients age 6 months and older can schedule their primary series of COVID-19 vaccination appointments through their [NYU Langone Health MyChart account](https://mychart.nyulmc.org/mychart/Authentication/Login?). You can also download the [NYU Langone Health app](https://nyulangone.app/S8U2gu47Vcb), and log in with your MyChart username and password to quickly and easily schedule your vaccination appointment. If you are an NYU Langone patient and do not have a MyChart account, [create your account now](https://activation.nyulmc.org/) so you can schedule your appointment. If you are a parent scheduling a vaccination appointment for your child, you must have shared access to your child's health record in MyChart in order to schedule. See our instructions for [requesting shared access](/patient-family-support/sharing-requesting-access-to-nyu-langone-health-mychart), also called proxy access, to MyChart. Please do not call your doctor's office about scheduling your primary series of vaccination appointments, as our vaccination appointments are made at specialized sites in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Long Island. You can choose the location and time that is most convenient for you. NYU Langone patients can make an appointment to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. These vaccines, which are highly effective at preventing severe disease, require two doses as part of your primary vaccination series. You can schedule the second dose through MyChart between three and four weeks after your first dose, depending on the vaccine you received. Children 6 months to 17 years of age can receive either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines for their primary vaccination series. Children ages 6 months to 4 years receive the Moderna vaccine as a two-dose primary series, while the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is given as a three-dose primary series to this age group. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone receive an updated Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna booster when eligible. These boosters, known as bivalent vaccines, protect against both the Omicron variant and the original virus strain. People age 6 months and older may be eligible for a bivalent booster if it has been at least two months since they received their primary vaccination series. The earlier Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna boosters, known as monovalent vaccines, are no longer available for people in these age groups. If you are eligible for a booster vaccination, you can schedule your appointment online through your [NYU Langone Health MyChart account](https://mychart.nyulmc.org/mychart/Authentication/Login?). Availability is based on our supply of the vaccines, which may be limited. We ask that you first contact your doctor before making a vaccination appointment if any of these categories apply to you: If you recently had COVID-19, we recommend waiting to receive your next vaccine dose\u2014primary or booster\u2014by about 3 months from when your symptoms started, or if you had no symptoms, when you first received a positive test. This allows your immune system time to recover and fully respond to the vaccine. Please do not schedule a vaccination or come to NYU Langone to be vaccinated if any of the following statements apply to you: The CDC provides detailed [information about the COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/index.html). NYU Langone also provides [vaccine information for patients](/locations/covid-19-vaccine/covid-19-vaccine-information-for-patients). If you have specific questions about the vaccine related to your health, please contact your NYU Langone doctor. We can help you find a doctor. Call "}
