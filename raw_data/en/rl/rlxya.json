Limited research on the effectiveness of aromatherapy and therapeutic use of essential oils; however, some empirical studies refer to benefiting effects of essential oils in multiple stress-caused disorders. The following paper will discuss the benefits and contraindications of using aromatherapy in a person's treatment based on scholarly research. In addition, based on the results, and integration into nursing practice will be provided. Aromatherapy is the medicinal or therapeutic use of essential oils absorbed through the skin or olfactory system (Lakhan et al., 2016). The public opinions on the practical use of aromatherapy effectiveness have divided; however, considerable research proves the benefiting results of such treatments if used correctly. Laboratory trials have determined a beneficial effect of aromatherapy for relieving depression and anxiety symptoms; however, the results are often discrepant (S\u00e1nchez-Vida\u00f1a et al., 2017). Therefore, the benefits of reducing anxiety are shown to be selective. Approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), aromatherapy is a low-cost and safe alternat to costly medication. Some studies confirm a relieving effect of essential oils in releasing pain, and changing pulse, blood pressure, skin temperature, and brain activity (Lakhan et al., 2016). Despite the subjectivity of pain, aromatherapy may become a safe alternative for relieving aches in various conditions. Additionally, essential oils are beneficial for people with sleeping problems, primarily when used as inhalation (Schneider et al., 2018). There are various benefits of using aromatherapy; hence, its inconsistent effect on multiple individuals requires patiently monitoring all of the outcomes. Despite a broad list of benefits, some precautions must be taken into consideration prior to starting aromatherapy. As this treatment method is most commonly performed through inhalation, the olfactory function must be evaluated by a specialist to make sure no harm will be caused by such a technique (S\u00e1nchez-Vida\u00f1a et al., 2017). Moreover, essential oils may cause allergic reactions if applied to the skin. Most prevalent allergies include rash or hives; thus, before starting aromatherapy, a patient must make sure they do not have allergies to a particular oil. Other contraindications include increased caution of essential oil use on children and older adults due to high sensitivity, people with asthma, high blood pressure, and epilepsy. In the case of the conditions mentioned above, certain oils are prohibited from use, and others must be limited. Aromatherapy requires a broad knowledge of each oil's effect to provide the safest procedure possible and avoid any unfavorable reaction. Aromatherapy is widely integrated into the nursing practice as an alternative method of treating some diseases. Multiple nursing theories confirm that aromatherapy may be used to relieve the stress of patients who have overcome major operations or go through significant pains (Gnatta et al., 2016). Such a method may be used as a device that improves the emotional state of a person as an additional nursing instrument. In a massage form, such a technique is confirmed to relieve chronic pain when used in nursing homes (Lakhan et al., 2016). Nevertheless, aromatherapy is not recommended as a primary source of treatment. To summarize, aromatherapy is accountable for multiple emotional benefits and is proved to improve a person's emotional state. Moreover, studies confirm that essential oils aid in pain-relieving; however, in a selective way. The biggest downside of aromatherapy is the lack of empirical research regarding its effect on the human body. Nevertheless, people with specific diseases or conditions must limit or avoid aromatherapy to decrease the chance of worsening the state of health. Because of multiple limitations and lack iveof scientific studies regarding aromatherapy, it can only be integrated into nursing practice as a complementary treatment. References Gnatta, J.
