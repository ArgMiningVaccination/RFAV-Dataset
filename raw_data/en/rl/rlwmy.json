In a petition submitted Thursday, the NGOs stated, \"Evidently, the Palestinian Authority has an insufficient number of vaccines, whereas in what is practically the same area, the population of Israeli citizens and residents is almost fully vaccinated, apart from those who decline it.\" The report noted that Israel doesn't have a legal obligation to vaccinate Palestinians since it has transferred this responsibility to the Palestinian Authority under the 1993 and 1995 Oslo Accords.
