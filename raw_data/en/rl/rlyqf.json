Even so, there is a good deal of consensus on the value of using a consumption aggregate as a summary measure of living standards, itself an important component of human welfare. In recent years, in much of the World Bank's operational work as well as in applied research, consumption aggregates constructed from survey data have been used to measure poverty, to analyze changes in living standards ovAer tme, aned to assess tli A i.utirua. i ^r.:tof p m.s ar.a policies. Despite this widespread use of consumption aggregates, there is little in the way of guidelines on how to construct consumption aggregates from survey data. Researchers and analysts interested in using consumption as a welfare measure must often work from whatever documentation exists from earlier exercises, zao ui a guu Oval vi. ULUMCadAMy replication with each analyst working afresh through the underlying theoretical and practical issues. This paper seeks to fill the gap by providing a brief theoretical introduction followed by practical advice on how to construct a consumption aggregate from household survey data. We re oguiizue what follows, with different kinds of surveys; and for different purposes; so that it is useful to start with something of a road map: Audience. We hope that these guidelines will be useful, not only to those whose immediate task is to use a survey (or surveys) to construct consumption aggregates, but also to statisticians, economists, or advisors who are interested in why consumpntinn agrevateQ mioht be iiefiul and the venne l fe ires of their construction. This latter group includes those in Statistical Offices who might be considering instituting a new consumption survey, or in modifying an old one. The arguments for and against consumption, usually in comparison with income aggregates, come up often enough that is useful to have guidelines on the main arguments, and on what is involved in constructing a consumption aggregate.

Issues of survey and questionnaire design are not dealt with in these guidelines but are dealt with in the companion piece by Deaton and Grosh (1998). At the same time, we have tried to discuss most of the detailed decisions that would have to be made by our first audience, those actually doing the calculations. There is illustrative code in the Appendix covering much of what has to be done, and there is discussion of most of the 1practical issues that have arisen over the years. But it is important that the calculations not be done mechanically. Each survey is different from every other survey, if only in detail, and each country has its own institutions that need to be taken into account. Constructing consumption aggregates without knowledge of the country and it insLitutions will not give -Ueflul results. In consequen,ce, analysts n,eed to be famlliliar wiuh Ule theory in order to be able to make sensible decisions when a new Droblem presents itself. as is alwavs the case in practice. Surveys: LSMS versus others? These guidelines have been prepared by and for the LSMS group in the Bank, and the examples in tne Appendix are drawn from LSMS surveys around the worid. wnenever we require asptneifi examnle, we take it frnm some LSMS survey, and we generally assu-mme that some version .f LSMS protocols have been used. However, we believe that these choices should not compromise the usefulness of the guidelines for those who are constructing consumption aggregates from other surveys. The theory is general, and almost all of the details of the construction would have to be followed through in one form or another using any consumption survey. It shouid aiso be noted that as the number of LSMS surveys has grown there has bee.n a great deal of variation in sulrvPy desigm, so that thpre are very few consumption surveys around the world whose design would not be represented in one or more LSMS surveys. A more serious issue is that many non-LSMS surveys will lack at least some of the information used in constructing a comprehensive measure. ..osean A used in poverty analysis, identifying the poor, and computing standard measures of poverty and ineaualitv. Such aggregates are also used for incidence analysis, to identify the position in the income distribution ofthose who are likely to benefit or lose from some policy, such as subsidies or taxes, or the provision of a service. We discuss the procedures that would normally be followed in constructing a consumption aggregate for such purposes. However, -we shall encounter a number of examples where procedures wii nave to be modified depending on the context and purpose. For example. some of the theoretically ideal concepts are hard to implement, and because the best is sometimes the enemy of the good, we will often recommend not trying to implement the theoretically ideal solution. But there will always be cases where the purpose of the exercise is compromised by such a decision, and attempts must be made. For example, it is very difficult to measure the welfare effects of public good provision, and we recommend against the routine inclusion of such valuations in the consnmption agregat.es. But if the aggregates arete to be uedto exami.ne the effects of public good provision on (for example) the regional distribution of poverty, then some attempt must be made. Again, the theoretical framework is the ultimate guide as to what to do. 2The rest of the paper is laid out as follows: The theoretical framework underlying the use of the consumption aggregate as a welfare measure is briefly reviewed in Section 2, along with a discussion of some ILUN UVO I. &WS % consumption based measure of welfare are then presented in Sections 3-5. The paper outlines a three-part procedure for the construction of a consumption-based measure of individual welfare: the various steps involved in aggregating different components of household consumption to construct a nominal consumption aggregate are laid out in Section 3. The construction of the price index in order to adjust for differences in prices faced by nouseholds is then reviewed in Secuon 4. Tne aUJustntIL of ihe rew conswumpuior aggregate for differences in composition between households is then presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 provides examples of some of the analytic techniques that can be used to examine the robustness of the measure to assumptions and choices made at the construction stage. The consumption aggregates constructed in recent years from tne Living Panama, and Brazil were reviewed for this paper (for a brief introduction to the LSMS project as well as a description of the main survey instruments typically used in these surveys, please consult the appendix). In none of the countries covered did we find the procedures followed to be fully in conformance with the recommendations provided in this paper; nonetheless, these case studies provided the basis for much of the prc.1 nvA..4- n-A rtolara. nspreser,ted *n to nc .* nnnrn.m nn aggregates in these countries are included in the appendix as they provide useful illustrations of the general steps involved in constructing the aggregates. 32. TiEOWY OF TkIL H ASUmKLENi OF WAWTLLFAL 2.1 Introduction: In this section, we discuss briefly the theoretical basis for the consumption-based measure of welfare whose detailed construction is explained elsewhere in the report. Our concern here is a fairly narrow one, focusing on an economic definution of living standards. 'w'e do not consider otiher important components of welfare, such as freedom, health status; life-exnectancyv or levels of education. all of which are related to income and consumption, but which cannot be adequately captured by any simple monetary measure. Consumption measures are limited in their scope, but are nevertheless a central component of any assessment of living standards. One important concept here is money metric utility, Samuelson (1974), which measures levels of living by the money required to sustain them. We start with this in Section 2.2 below. An alternative approach, based on Blackorby and Donaldson's (1987) concept of welfare ratios, whereby welfare is measured as multiples of a poverty line, is presented in Section 2.3. Eacn ofI te money-metric and consumption aggregate, but adiust it differently= These first subsections cover the basic ideas, and are followed by subsections on a range of theoretical issues that repeatedly come up in practice. A fuller, and only slightly outdated, treatment is given in Deaton (1980) in one of the earliest LSMS Working Papers (no. 7). Our treatment here skips theoretical developments that are of limited relevance in practice given the data that are typically available, or that can be calculated. For exampie, ,,e r consumption of individual goods to maximize utility within a given budget and at given prices. Consumer preferences over goods are thought of as a system of indifference curves, each linking bundles that are equally good, and with higher indifference curves better than lower ones. A given indifference curve corresponds to a given level of welfare, well-being, or living-standards, so that the measurement of welfare boils down to labeling fne indifference curves, and hien iocatung each nousenoid on an indifference curve. hnere are many wavs of iRhelinng indifference curves. One possibilitv would be to take some reference cnommdityh bndle and to label indifference curves by the distance from the origin of their point of intersection with the bundle. In Figure 1, the reference quantity vector is shown as the line qo so that the two indifference curves Hand JJare 4labeled as OA and OB respectively. Instead of a reference set of quantities, we can select a reference set of prices, gnd calculate the amount of money needed to reach the two indifference curves; this is Samuelson's money metric utility. In the Figure, money metric utility is constructed by drawing the two tangents to the i,de-.3 c wvs,v. lpestb h C'an OD'in terms of a. or OC and OD in terms of a,. q2tl I I Flgure 1: Two ways of labeling indifference curves To see how this works, we introduce some notation. Write x for total expenditure, and denote bDy c u, p ) tne cost or expendiubre funiction, which associates wiui each vector of prices p uie minimuin cost of rearhing the utility level u Since the household maximizes utility, it must minimize cost of reaching u; so that C(u { ;,) = X. (,2.1) Denote by superscript h the household whose welfare we are measuring, and let p\u00b0 denote a vector of 5reference prices, the choice of which we discuss below. Money metric utility for household h, denoted Um , is defined by Uh =C(U, PO ) fl which is the minimum cost of reaching u. at prices po. Note that, although utility itself is to a large extent arbitrary, we can label indifference curves any way we choose, as long as higher indifference curves are iabDeie wuith larger vhaues of utilityv money metric utility is defined by an indifference curve and a set of nrce; is independent of the labels, and is therefore well-defined given the indifference curves. The exact calculation of money metric utility requires knowledge of preferences. Although preferences can be recovered from knowiedge of demand functions, we typically prefer some shortcut method that, even if app,Atpc enot r. i4vp the Pe ia .xni, nth l1 teip nefw%m,\u00b6nn,iCg assumptions, including often controversial identifying assumptions, and potential loss of credibility. The most convenient such approximation comes from a first-order expansion of c ( Uh, po ) in prices around the vector of prices actually faced by the household, ph The derivatives of the cost function with respect to prices are the quantities consumed, a result known as Shephard's Lemma (or Roy's Identity), see for example Deaton and follows c( u, p ) _cp( uh, P)+(P Ph).q (2.3) where the centered \"* \"indicates an inner product. Since the minimum cost of reaching uh at ph is the amount spent ph * qh , (2.3) can be written as umh =C(Uh pI) ;UpI *qh (2.4) National Income Accounting Practice, in which real national product would include real consumer's expenditure, which is the sum over all consumers of their consumption valued at base prices, i.e. the sum of the right hand side of (2.4) over all agents. Tlnis equation is still not quite in convenient form for practice, since we rarely observe a complete set nf Paasche price index comparing the price vectors ph and po is defined as 6ph P q (2.5) so that, from (2.4), we have ,h _Ah _h U h # F F = AL (2.6) m ph ph so that money metric utility can be approximated by adding up all the housenolc's expendaiures, ana ividamg hu a P iaashp ip npof pnrines. For readers who are used to thinking about price indexes as summarizing prices at different points of time, it is perhaps useful to add a few words of explanation about our use of the Paasche (and later Laspeyres) labels for the price indexes used here. When we are working with a single cross-sectional household survey, 4s. p..c poni,tru pay, Ai^..r.n.t prices for comparable goods. (If we have two surveys for the same country at different times, or if the survey is spread over months or years, the variation will be both temporal and spatial.) In industrialized countries, where transportation is easy and inexpensive, and there are integrated distribution systems for most consumer goods, spatial price variation is small, housing being the major exception. But in many developing countries, spatial puIce UIIfe[ZII5 can UV laV rdgV, In the temDoral context. a Paasche price index is one whose (quantity) weights relate to the current period, rather than the base period. In the current spatial context, the \"current period\" is replaced by the \"household under consideration\", whose purchases are used to weight the prices it faces relative to some base or reference prices. Perhaps the major practical point about (2.5) is that the weights for the prices differ from household to househnold so that for example, two households in the same village, buying their goods in the same maryetLs, snd faning the same nrices- will have different nrice indexes if thev have different tastes or incomes. At first sight, such a situation may seem hopelessly complicated. But the transparency is restored if we tiink of money metric utility as (2.4), the household's consumption bundle priced at fixed prices, and if we recognize that (2.6), the deflation of nominal expenditure by a Paasche index with household specific weights, as simply a means of caiculating the constant price totai. Deriving total expenditure and dividing it by a price index is our basic strategy for using LSMS consumption data to measure welfare. In practice, there are myriad adjustments and approximations to be 7made, and there are cases where the conceptual framework has to be (slightly) extended. We deal with the most important of these in the rest of this section. Before doing so, however, we must discuss a potential problem with money metric utility, and an alternative approach. 2.3 An alternative approach: welfare ratios: One of the important uses of measures of standard of living is to support policy, particularly policy where distribution is an issue. In particular, much policy is conducted on the basis that transfers of money are more valuable the lower in tne distriDution is the recipient. Tnis may take tne form of a focus on poverty wnere the pnnr nre given diqtrihlltinnTl weights that decline as we look at people with higher standards of living. Blackorby and Donaldson (1988) have shown that the use of money metric utility can cause difficulties in this context. To see the problem, start by assuming that total household expenditure (or income) x is a satisfactory measure of living standards, something that would be true if everyone faced the same prices, and everyone lived alone, or at least in hkJouseholAs LfI%o ton '.d in welfare, so that policymakers who are averse to inequality can work under the assumption that increases inx have a lower social marginal value the higher in the distribution is the recipient. But money metric utility is not x, but a function of x. As Figure 1 makes ciear, money-metric utility is higher the higher is x, so that more money corresponds to a higher indifference curve and standard of living. But what Blackorby and 1LV ML Wat w JLI money metric utility increases with x can be constant, decreasing, or increasing, and that, in general, which is the case depends on the choice of the reference price vector p\u00b0 .This has the effect of breaking any close link between redistributive policy and the measurement of its effects. For example, suppose that a change in policy-for example, a transfer policy-has the effect of transferring money from better-off to worse-off housenoids, so ulal uie ustribution of money 'nas become more equa. But because we do noti know exactly hnw mnney metric utility is linked to moneyv there is no miaramtee that the distrhiitinn ofmnney metric utility has also narrowed. So we have lost the ability to monitor the distributional effects of policy, and what we get when we try will be different at different choices of reference prices p 0.Since we are often forced to use whatever prices are available to us, we may not even be able to control the outcome. n ovrder to avoid these problems, Blackorb-y ad Donaldson (1997) have -propose '2.e 'o a \"welfare ratio\" measure in place of money-metric utility; within the Bank, the use of welfare ratios is reviewed by Ravallion (1998). The basic idea is to express the standard of living relative to a baseline indifference curve. In poverty analysis, a natural (and useful) choice is the poverty indifference curve, the level of living that marks 8the boundary between being poor and non-poor. The welfare ratio is then the ratio of the household's expenditure to the expenditure required to reach the poverty indifference curve, both expressed at the prices faced by the household. Once again, Figure 1 can serve to illustrate. fifl- is taken to be the tAnlcp tn illustrate current, not reference, prices, the welfare ratio is OD/OC or (equivalently) OD VOC'. In terms of the cost functions, the ratio is given by , h h~h C(u,p ) (2.7)wr = 27 C(u ) where u z is the utility poverty-line, the utility corresponding to the poverty indifference curve. Unlike money metric utility, which is a money measure-the minimum amount of money needed to reach an. in.dif e ciiv_-kthe welfare r.atio is a pure n.um..ber t.e staarAd of livinrg as a multiple of tfe poverty line. In practice, it is useful to convert the welfare ratio into a money measure, and again the obvious procedure is to multiply the ratio by the poverty line, defined as the cost of obtaining poverty utility at reference prices, c(uz,po) .This gives the welfare ratio measure, which we denote by u . r(uAh nh.1 c( , x c(u , p ) (2.8) Like the money metric utility measure, (2.8) is total expenditure x divided by a price index, in this case the true cost of living index ph versus p\u00b0 computed at the poverty line indifference curve. This cost-of- living price index would normally be approximated by the Laspeyres index Dh z P pq_ Pi q (Pih ) ,,O( 'Lz o p * q i.1poqZ pi idI pi) (2.9) where q2 is the quantity of i consumed at the poverty line and the weights w' are the shares of the budget at the poverty line indifference curve and prices p 0.Putting (2.8) and (2.9) together, we get an expression for the money version of the welfare ratio that corresponds to (2.6) for money metric utility 9h .h _' X ( r U4r Ph k_-/ If we compare (2.6) and (2.10), we see that money metric utility involves deflation of expenditure by a Paasche index of prices, while the welfare ratio measure involves deflation of expenditure by a Laspeyres price index. (The calculation of the poverty-line weights in (2.9) will be discussed in Section 4.) Jul somle price indexes are close to one another, either because the two sets of weights are similar in the two periods, or because relative prices are similar. In the current context, where we are most often interested in comparing prices between different places, where both weights and relative prices are often quite different, the Paasche and Laspeyres price indexes will also be different, as will therefore be money metric utility and weliare ratio measures. O'n 'iini 'iieooretical side, the point to is tiat Laspeyres index M (2.IV) is comnuted at the povertv indifference curve. so that its weights (see also 2.9) are unaffected by changes in total expenditure of household h. As a result, ur is proportional to xh, and there is a direct link between redistributive policy and the measurement of its effects. Welfare ratios resolve the difficulties of using money- metric utility to monitor the outcomes of distributionally sensitive policies. On the empirical side, the Paasche and Laspeyres indexes wiii be close to one another when the price relatives are close to one another over diffiprfm.t crrnod zTni sPr%An,pQ at the base, i.n tkica fkp poverty line, as for other households in the survey. But there is no reason to suppose that either will be true in cross-sectional surveys. Regional price differences are often markedly different across goods depending on agricultural zones or distance from the ocean, and expenditure pattems differ sharply over households of different types, or even across households that have much the same observable characteristics. In practice, as wel as;n heo.1,I^. ..one-...etri;c ar.d How do we choose between the two approaches to welfare measurement? As we have presented it so far, the balance seems to favor the welfare ratio approach. It is simpler to calculate, since the weights for the price index are the same for everyone, and it has a straightforward theoretical link to total expenditure, which facilitates distIUouUUnal analysis. it Is also clear irom conversautions win nanK stf, fnat aeiiaton oI an expenditure measure by a fixed weizht Lasnewres index is a procedure that is bnth simple and tran.sparent and that could be explained and defended to policymakers. For some, those benefits are likely to be decisive. Nevertheless, the welfare ratio approach is not without its own Achilles heel. As Blackorby and Donaldson show, welfare ratios do not necessarily indicate welfare correctly. It is possible for a policy to make someone 10better off, and yet to decrease their welfare ratio. This cannot happen for money metric utility, no matter which set of reference prices are used in the evaluation. So while money metric utility is more problematic for distributional calculations, the welfare ratio approach throws out at least some of the baby along with the bath- water. Our own choice is to stick with money metric utility, and we recommend at least trying to calculate the ralo,,onf Dnr.n.h irn.de-es as disc.useA n,Arnrise tr-rnnnn 0nA ornnhinit., we recommend describing money metric utility according to (2.4) where each household's bundle of goods and services is evaluated, not at the prices they paid, but at a common set of prices. It is also worth noting that, given the difficulties of calculating prices and price indexes in practice, as well as the much graver conceptual and practical problems of dealing with differences in household size and composition, see Section 5, the choice Ub.wLWVr L,UnVy ,1,,e-i, decisio,, ar.u Ilay not paramount importance. Among economici measures oi iiving sianuarus, uie Mrain compeUtr Lo a consuipton-DaseU measure is a measure based on income. In most industrialized countries. including the U.S.. living standards and poverty are assessed with reference to income, not consumption. This tradition is followed in much of Latin America, where many household surveys make no attempt to collect consumption data. By contrast, most Asian surveys, including the Indian NSS and the Indonesian SUSENAS, have always collected detailed consumption data, and are thus closer in spirit to LSMS surveys. Tnere are both theoretical and practical reasons that rm.ust be considered whekn mn>iing the choice to use inconme or consuempirtioin tor neasClre liAng standards. In the theory outlined in the previous subsection, the choice between income and consumption did not arise because, in a single period model, there is no distinction; all income is consumed, and income and total c --a;n is saving, or dissaving, so that in terms of the theory, the choice between income and consumption is tied to the choice of the period over which we want to measure welfare. Over a long enough period of time, such as a lifetime, and provided that we work in present value terms, the average level of consumption (including any bequests) must equal the average level of income (including any inheritances), so that, if the concern -114aUre fVI WUInLgII WIUI a lifetime measure. Many would argue that ineaualitv is overstated by including the comDonent that comes from the variation in living standards with age. According to this view, there is no inequality if, over life, everyone gets their turn to be relatively rich or relatively poor. But the argument for abolishing the concept of age-related 11povertv is weaker; and policymakers (and their constituents) frequently show concern about child and old-age poverty. Even so, few would argue for very short reference periods for living standards; that someone is \"poor\" for a day or two is of little concern, since most people have ways of tiding themselves over such short periods. There is more concen about seasonal poverty, especially in agricultural societies with limited or very expensive credit availability. But most standard househoid surveys are not designed to capture seasonal fluictuiatinns in inenme or exnentitire- antd mnqt anti-nnvertv nolicies are directed at ln-nger term levels of living. On balance, and for most purposes, there is widespread agreement that a year is a sensible practical compromise for the measurement of welfare. In consequence, we must decide whether it is consumption, income, or wealth, or some combination of all three, that permits the best measure of living standards over a year. The empirical literature on the relationship between income and consumption has established, for both rich and poor countries, that consumption is not closely tied to short-term fluctuations in income, and that consumption is smoother and less-variable than income. Extreme versions of the smoothing story involve people evening out their resources over a lifetime, something for which there is little convincing evidence. But *U-.r %,VLLUII3 VVVL seasons, and in most cases, over a few years. As a result, in circumstances where income fluctuates a great deal from year to year-as in rural agriculture-the ranldng of households by income will usually be much less stable than the ranking by consumption, though exceptions can occur as discussed in Chaudhuri and Ravallion (1994). Even limited smoothing gives consumption a practical advantage over income in the measurement of living standards because ooservmig consumption over a reiauveiy snort penou, even a weeK or two, will tell us a great deal more about annual-or even longer period-livingy standards than will a similar observation nn income. Although consumption has seasonal components-for example, those associated with holidays and festivals-they are of smaller amplitude than seasonal fluctuations in income in agricultural societies. In such communities, it is usually not possible to get a useful measure of living standards based on income without multiple seasonal visits to the household, something that has rarely been attempted within LSMS protocois. In seasons wh2e.n people h.av their ffr.an.ced frtomr assets, or from _nvits so fiiet an alternative way to measuring living standards without consumption data would be to gather data on income and assets. But assets are typically difficult to measure accurately, so that this is not usually a practical alternative. 1FIq- cuui D4.IILC IVui an LSMS is beine run. Where self-emloyment, including small business and agriculture, 12is common, it is notoriously difficult to gather accurate income data, or indeed to separate business transactions from consumption transactions. Income from self-employment is hard to measure in industrialized countries too, but self-employment is rarer relative to wage income, so that, for most households, a fairly accurate picture o0 no-usehiu micomre UiWcIIlU. iiI uiL U.S.. it costs five times as much Der household to collect consumution (and other) information in the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CEX) as it does to collect income (and other) data in the Current Population Survey (CPS). As a result, the CPS can be much larger than the CEX, and it is the former that is used for poverty statistics because of the greater regional and racial disaggregation that the larger sample can support. In developing countries, the calculation of income often requires tne measurement of aii own-account tr~iisacinn m 12hteTs as tl depreciation of tools or animals. Consumption data are expensive to collect in poor countries as in rich, but the concepts are clearer, the protocols are well-understood, and less imputation is required. Perhaps in consequence, there is a long tradition of successful and well-validated consumption surveys in developing countries. One argument that can be made for income is that it is often possible to assign particular sources of income to particular members of the household; for example, earnings from the market can be attributed to the individual who did the work, and pensions are typically \"owned\" by an identifiable member of the household. By contrast, consumption is only occasionally measured for individual household members. While many aLUU1esIi UW U the effects of who \"owns\" the income on purchases, it should be clear that there is no very clear link between individual welfare and individual income. Earnes or pensioners share their incomes with non- earnes and non-pensioners, so that the attribution of individual welfare from individual income requires some sort of imputation scheme, just as it does for consumption. Although we shall discuss issues of how to adjust welfare for housenold size and composition in Section 5 below, we provide no guidance on how to use survey data on either consumntion or income to study the allocation of resources within the household. Such allocations are often best studied through other measures, for example anthropometric or educational status, though there is an extensive (though only occasionally successful) literature on using household consumption data to make inferences about intrahousehold allocation, see Deaton (1997, Chapter 3) for a review and discussion. 2.5 Durable goods: Because durable goods last for several years, and because it is clearly not thepurchase of durables that 13is the relevant comnonent of welfare. they reauire special treatment when calculating total expenditure. It is the use of a durable good that contributes to welfare, but since use is rarely observed directly, it is typically assumed to be proportional to the stock of the good held by the household. In consequence, when we add up total household expenditures during the year, we add to expenditures on non-durables the annual cost of hoiding tne stock of each durable. This cost is estimated from a conceptual experiment in wnich we imagine the holusehold huviTi the tiurahle good at the beginningy nf each vear- and then selling it again at vear's end- The costs of doing this depend on the price at the beginning of the year, pt, say, its price at the end of the year, p,+,, on the nominal interest rate, rt, which is the cost of having money tied up in the good for the year, and on the extent to which the durable good deteriorates during the year. Deterioration is modeled by means of the simple assumption that the quantity of the good is subject to \"radioactive decay\"' so that, if the household StutSa nff tl,p year w it the a.n,n,int li arn aarn..irit I back at th,e er'.d af t). year- Seen from the beginning of the year, the sales at the end of the year must be deflated to put them on discounted present value terms so that, in today's money, the discounted present cost (negative profit) ofthe transaction is St Pt -Pt+j_ (2.11) so that the cost of maintaining the st0cr-_,;r,h ;a iS of wi- r.ee to ad up total pei approximately (provided the interest rate and depreciation rate are small) .V^ n {w r+ ;){1< where t is the rate of inflation of the durable good price, ( pt,+ -Pt) / Pt. If it is assumed that the rate of inflation of the durable good is the same as that of other goods, the first two terms in the bracket give the real r.ta fA Aintoro en that thA -,fia r nrina n...hln:AS k, * sum of the real interest rate and its rate of deterioration. This is typically referred to as \"user cost\" or, since it would be the rental charge for the durable in a competitive market, as the \"rental equivalent.\" In Section 3.4 below, we discuss how the elements of (2.12) are computed from the LSMS data. Note that tue ap-proach based on -user cost makes nO allowance for the (oi;tn considerabie) ransactions costs involved in buying and selling durable goods, particularly used durable goods. Such cnots mean that households cannot easily take advantage of temporarily high real interest rates by reallocating their portfolios away from durables and holding money or other assets. Given this, it is important not to make user cost too sensitive to market fluctuations in real interest rates, and this can be accomplished by using, not today's real 14interest rate, but some average computed over a number of years. One of the most important durable goods for many households is housing itself. Many people rent their accommodation, in which case the \"rental equivalent\" is actual rent, which is gathered in the can sometimes be used, if people have some idea of what their house is worth, or the rental rate can be imputed by observing the rental costs of similar units. In Section 3.5 below, we discuss how this is calculated from the data gathered in LSMS surveys. 2.6 The evaluation of tlme and leisure: It is often pointed out that people's levels of living depend, not only on how much they spend, but also on the amount of leisure they have, so that using a pure consumption measure could be misleading. For example, if two people have the same income and expenditure, but one has a two hour daily commute to get to work, and the other none, they are not equally well off. Similarly, singie-parent households with children are li.kely ain. expenditure. Adding in an allowance for the value of leisure or of non-market work could eliminate these anomalies. The theory in Section 2.2 can readily be extended to tell us what to do. In the single period model, --. _.I_A..P_U1_ + y (2.13) where T is the total time endowment, e is time spent in leisure, and y is income that is not associated with time in the market. Rewriting this gives p-q + we=wT + y (2.14) so that leisure takes itS place with the other gnond5- with price w- and the budget constraint says that expenditures on all goods, including leisure, must be no more than \"full income,\" defined as non-market income plus the value of the time endowment. Leisure can then be incorporated into the welfare measure by working not with expenditure on goods, x, but with expenditure on goods and leisure together. T1iics is cor.rea far as it goes, buIt if stops ha.rp c,4rvrnl,, o., r .i?rn a pt.A-,,,- with full expenditure, a serious error will have been made. In the theory at the beginning ofthis section, money 15metrin anid welfare ratio utility were rneasured- not hy expenditure.s x. but by x divided by a price index. In those situations where the prices of goods do not differ much across households, which apart perhaps from housing is the normal situation in industrialized countries, a welfare ranking of households according to x will be very similar to a welfare ranking according to x deflated by the price index. But once leisure is introduced, the situation is quite different, because the price of leisure, the wage rate, differs across peopie. Rankings by fi1ll the wage as one of the prices. By the failure to deflate, the welfare of high wage people is overstated, and the welfare of low wage people understated. A high wage rate not only makes the time endowment more valuable-which is taken into account in full income or full expenditur-but it also makes leisure more expensive-which is not. It is incorrect to assess individual or household welfare levels usingfiull income or J\"gt c,rr\"sz UW\"t&\"sU Vs\"I Suppose that the error is avoided, and a price index including the wage is constructed which is then used to deflate full expenditures. In some circumstances, the resulting welfare measure will be better than one based on expenditures ignoring leisure. But there are also a number of problems that cause us not to recoimmwenu uUs p[rocedure Hi g9VUVF4l. IL assumieu for -ilu time-endowment. T. should this be 24 hours for each day, or should it be something less, to allow for sleep and \"minimal personal maintenance?\" More serious still is the real possibility that the simple model of labor supply that underlies the calculations may be at odds with the facts. For example, suppose that we find an adult in the survey who does not work. According to the model, this person is voluntarily allocating resources to leisure, and although we don't oDserve tnat person's wage-because he or she is not value based onr are working. But this person might be unemployed, and unable to find work, or maybe able to find work only at wages that are much lower than those who are working, and whose wages we are using to value \"leisure.\" It adds insult to injury to class unemployed people as well-off by imputing to them a value of leisure based on wages in a formal sector to which they have no access. Because ofthese dangers, we believe that the attempt to value leisure introduces more problems than it is likely to solve, and may compromise the integrity and general credibility of the welfare measures produced from the survey data. Of course, we are not disputing that leisure is valuable, nor that there will be specific cases where assigning some value to it will generate useful supplementary evidence on levels of living. Indeed, time-use data, when available, are a val-uable comnplement to cons-umpLion aggregates for studying welfare. They allow us to identifv those-such as people who must travel long distances to work- or women who mu-st 16combine childcare with market work-whose welfare is incorrectly assessed by their consumption alone, and permit at least rough-and-ready corrections in circumstances where such cases are a focus of interest. 2.7 Public goods and publicly supplied goods: Another important contribution to living standards that is ignored by private consumption is that made by publicly provided goods, the most important of which are education and health, but which also include such things as police, water, sanitation, justice, public parks, and national defense. The major problem with icuAdUUUig U1*Les is iiiuui a WULUlU to'ea4h huUe11U1U. One approach to estimating prices is to look for effects of the provision of public goods on the demand for private goods. For example, we might be able to assess the value of a new public clinic by seeing how much less people spend on private doctors or clinics. But it is clear that this line of investigation, although useful in some cases, cannot work in general. If the publicly provided good is separable in preferences from private .~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~ _ if part ofI I is separable, cnanges mi the provision oI tIe former tor m its separablc part) will have no effect on the latter. In conseauence. there is no hone of comnuting the full shadow nrice based on observable behavior. The other approach, which has recently become popular in the project evaluation literature, is to ask people how much they would be prepared to pay for an additional unit ofthe good. Whether such \"contingent valuation\" procedures yield useful numbers remains controversial among both economists and psychologists, see Hanemann (I 994) for the arguments in favor, and Diamond and Hausman (i994) for the (,,ntiih w e believe tha>t i em. tUtiniw* ,finr public goods are likely to compromise the credibility and usefulness of welfare measures in general. None of which gainsays the fact that the documentation of who gets access to publicly provided goods and services, and whether these people are poor or rich, remains an important element in any overall assessment of living standards and poverty. It should be noted that there are some cases where the necessity to make some allowance for public goods cannot be avoided. The most obvious case is when maldng international comparisons where in one country, some good-health and housing are the obvious examples-is publicly provided or subsidized, while in the other it is obtained through the market. Even within a country, urban residents may have access to sUUbsUild difficulties of measurement, and the variety of possible cases, it is impossible to make useful general recommendations about how imputations might be done. It will sometimes be enough to be aware of the problem and its implication for certain types of welfare comparisons; in other cases, it will be necessary to try to revalue consumption at international or unsubsidized prices, even if such imputations carry a large margin of 17error. 2.8 Farm households: 1W s have small, own-account business, and many more are farm-households who produce goods, sometimes for the market, and sometimes for their own consumption. The standard approach to these mixed entities is to split them into a consumption unit and a production unit. This can be done under the conditions of the \"separation\" property, see Singh, Strauss, and Squire (1976). If markets are perfect, so that all factors are perfectly oimiugencous and can be bought and sold at fixed prics m uimii ted quanuties, tnen a farm-ho:usehold behaves exactly as if it were the sum of a farm. which maxi-mizes nrofits at given market prices, and a household, which chooses its consumption bundle so as to maximize its welfare at fixed prices and subject to its income, including the profits from its farm. The assumptions of the separation theorem are more obviously appropriate to the owners of an agribusiness who live in New York city than to most subsistence farm househoids in developing countries, or eisewhere. Family labor is not the same as hired labor, wnrlr may not always be Avnilnhle 2t \"the\" frnm uwnrk may redluce the effective price of work on the home farm. All of these issues can be dealt with by suitable modifications of the theory, but only at the cost of introducing shadow prices that are even more difficult to observe and to calculate than the actual prices, the collection of which itself imposes considerable difficulty. \"T,. jJSW.-c , it i8 Wiflc.uAAt to treat. -fl% fats b .4..es a0 distinct units, and to value the sales from one to the other at some suitable prices. These prices are of course not observed for the households for which they are required, but must be imputed from purchases of such goods by other households, or from prices collected in the community questionnaire. This tends to be a very approximate business, so that it is perhaps unreasonable to insist too strictly on abstract considerations. that should not be included when evaluating consumption from home production: \"farm-gate\" not \"market\" prices are appropriate for imputation. It is also necessary to be careful about quality comparability, home produce may (or may not) be of lower quality, and water from the local pond is certainly different fromL 'Eau Perrier. Ac we shall goon deal nf inaccuracy. In countries where a large fraction of food consumption comes from home production-see Table 3.1 for examples-imputations, and the role of the separation theorem, can generate considerable discomfort 18with the resulting calculations. The methods of this paper make most sense where markets are active, and where the standard neoclassical model is a good approximation to reality. For many non-monetized subsistence economies, this is hardly the case. In such economies, the ratio of measurement to imputation is often quite low, and there is a real question about whether we are \"'measuring\" or \"assuniing;. And even if imputations are accurate on av .agewhich would be assIMing a geat deAIt,ey tenrd to be less ,.4-able tkan would be the true data, so that their use tends to understate inequality and (in most cases) poverty. Money metric and welfare-ratio measures of welfare were developed to measure living standards for households who obtain their goods and services through the market and make the best choices that their incomes will permit given the prices that they face. In peasant economies, this neoclassical model is often a poor approximation to o-sfl..e again. we have no useful counsel except to be aware of the issue, and sometimes to be prepared to concede defeat. 2.9 Differences in tastes across people and households: The theoretical framework of Section 2.2 works with a single set of nreferences so that when we rank different households according to their money metric utility, we are locating their different expenditures levels on the same set of indifference curves. Since different people have different tastes, it is not clear why this is the correct thing to do. O)ne' 2rclimtnt iq that or her own lights, but that we need to know about the welfare of a reference person given the circumstances ofthe individual. Hence, we need a reference set of preferences, as well as a reference set of prices. The answer to the question \"How well-off would John Doe be with household h's income?\" is of more general- interest than allowing the idiosyncrasies of each person's tastes to affect the evaluation of his or her resources. For example, n... Aessr.t- a gntrn. ;nnnm r- pr jusot bemaOus thai income did not match their greed. More seriously, altruists are not deemed to be rich because their neighbors are rich nor, in the same circumstances, are the envious deemed to be poor. Nevertheless, there are some taste factors that affect the translation of money into welfare for everyone, ard U14L lU pllU a great deal of money for life-saving surgery or simply to stay alive would not be deemed to be rich because of such expenditure. But in practice, the most important taste-like factor that must be allowed for is household size and composition. There is a useful analogy here with prices; prices, like needs, moderate the way in which 19expenditures on each good generate welfare. If the price of rice is three times as high, 50 rupees can onlybuy a third as much rice. Similarly, 50 rupees worth of rice buys only a third as much per person in a household of three persons as in a household of one. According to this analogy, expenditure must not only be deflated by a price index that reflects variations in the costs of goods and services, but it must also be deflated by some n-^easrve of household hiuw LU Con LIruCt the appropriate measures. There is another issue about taste variation. This is the question of \"regrettable necessities,\" goods and services that yield no welfare in their own right, but that have to be purchased, for example, in order to earn icorme. W ork clotuhes or raIIsport to wUrk are aid ule argument is tuh sucn items snouid be deducted from income rather than included in consumntion. If this is not done- individualq with differen.t expenditures on regrettable necessities will not be correctly ranked if we rely only on their total consumption inclusive of such expenditures. Again, the theoretical validity of such points should not blind us to the practical difficulties. Transport to work is a regrettable necessity for someone who has little choice of where to work or where to live, but is consumption for someone wno chooses to live in a pieasant suburb. Out-of-pocket medical I m ; ediu.i,e TIto;odt+o see how guidelines could be constructed that would allow one and not the other. The issue here is essentially the same as that facing a tax authority when deciding what expenses should be allowed as deductions against income in the computation of income tax. While recognizing the occasional injustice, such authorities tend to take a hard line on such deductions in order to avoid large scale abuse. Exactly the same arguments apply here. 20Box 1.

CONSTRUCTING THE HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION AGGREGATE 3.1 IntroIuction: Following the diiscussion of the basic theoretical firmewnrk inplicit in using c-nnlrnution as a measure of welfare, this section provides specific guidelines that the analyst can follow to construct a nominal consumption aggregate from a typical LSMS household survey. For the purposes of this paper, the procedures followed in constructing the consumption aggregate from recent household surveys in the following countries were reviewed in detail: Vietnam, Nepal, Ghana, the Kyrgyz Republic, Ecuador, South Africa, Panama, and One important preliminary issue should be emphasized, though it is one where it is hard to give any very precise guidelines. This is the issue of data cleaning. In most cases, analysts who are constructing consumption aggregates will be using a \"clean\" set of data that has already been subjected to the usual IoraLiI.ey cheLv-s new exercise reveals new problems with the data, and the construction of a consumption aaaregate is no exception. As we shall see, the construction of a consumption aggregate involves adding together a large number of items, many but by no means all from the consumption section of the questionnaire. It is of the greatest importance that the analyst check each of these items for the presence of \"gross\" outliers, typically by graphing the data, for exarmpic using iiie oneway andi oox options in STA I A. r or inherently posiuve quantities, it is often useful to do this in logs as well as in levels. Aggaregates and sub-aa repates should similarly be checked. Such checks often reveal, not only isolated outliers, but groups of outliers, for example if the units have been misinterpreted for all observations in a cluster. Sometimes, outliers can clearly be attributed to coding errors, as when the units have been misinterpreted, or where zeros have been added, and in such cases it is routine to impute an average (or better median) value for other househoids in the same ciuster or region. In other cases, it is unclear uwhether thi \"Antlier\" is genr.uini nr inot, and the analyst m.ust ma,e a judgment that balances the desirability of keeping any reasonable number against the risk of contaminating the aggregate. In Table 3.1, the components of consumption are aggregated into four main classes: (i) food items, (ii) nnfoodf ,tt*lI.-, (iii)j -- e UAtbOY. oAcasses U;n the overall consumption aggregate depends on many factors, including the average level of income in the country, prevalent tastes and norms, as well as the types of data collected in the survey. In this regard, it shouldbe noted that there was considerable variation in the design of questionnaires across the various countries, so that the aggregates do not always include the same items. Nonetheless, the table is indicative of the order of magnitude and relative importance of the sub-aggregates. Table 3. 1: Main components of the consumption aggregate Share of consumption aggregate (per cent) Sub-aggregate Vietnam Nepal Ghana Kyrgyz Ecuador ' 29.0 44.4 33.4 44.3 28.2 39.8 21.0 Home oroduction b 16.8 35.2 20.8 11.1 5.3 2.2 6.1 6.7 Non-food Items: 28.7 194 28.0 22.5 29.1 45.1 45.8 32.0 Education 2.5 3.4 N/a 2.4 8.2 3.2 7.8 6.4 Health 5.7 3.2 N/a 1.0 . 1.7 0.9 4.5 Other non-foods 20.5 12.8 N/a 19.1 20.9 40.2 37.1 21.1 Consumer Durables 12.7 1.4 2.2 3.5 5.2 . 5.4 Housing 7.7 .1i 2.5 29.6 16.0 24.5 2.8 40.2 Rent 5.9 12.6 1.7 17.6 12.1 15.6 2.1 31.4 Utilities 1.8 2.5 0.8 11.9 3.9 8.9 0.7 100.0 100.0 390 550 1,280 2,980 3,080 4,400 a Includes meals taken away from the home. b Includes also food received from other household members, friends, and in the formn of in-lind payments. c GINP per capita is taken from intemational statistics for the same year of tne survey, except for Panama wnere the latest available estimate is for 1996. in generl, as we would e-xpect irom nEgel's law, hui snare of food items in the Lotal tends to be relatively more irnmortant the lower the level of income in tie countrv. The share of home-production in the food consumption aggregate tends to be higher in countries where relatively fewer transactions take place through the market place (Nepal, Vietnam) compared to those countries where agricultural markets are relatively well-developed (Ecuador, Panama, South Africa). iirn.-.e of the country, as well as the extent to which these services are purchased through the market, or else are provided instead by the state at subsidized rates. A more detailed discussion of each of the main classes in the overall consumption aggregate is taken up in the sections that follow: 243.2 Food consumption: In principle, constructing a food consumption sub-aggregate is a straightforward aggregation exercise; all that is needed are data on the totai value of the various food consumed in the reference period, or else on the total quantities of Aiffp.rpn+t food iters conisurmed as mrel v alue thenm. Tn practice, however, households consume food obtained from a variety of different sources, and so in computing a measure of total food consumption to include as part of the aggregate welfare measure, it is important to include food consumed by the household from all possible sources. In particular, this measure should include not just (i) food purchased in the market place, including meals purchased away trom home for consumption at Vl away 4 l.V .W v* S* fl1fl to from other households, as well as (iv) food received from employers as payment in-kind for services rendered. In some cases where food can be and is stored over long periods of time, and where the questionnaire permits it, \"food consumed\" can be distinguished from \"food purchased\". In principle, it is the value of the former that should go into the consumption aggregate. A household that stocks up on cereals once every few months, and wh not stock up in the survey period be counted as poor. The food consumption module of most LSMS questionnaires typically contains separate sets of questions on (a) purchased and (b) non-purchased food items. As can be seen from Table 3.1, the relative importance of these two components in the food consumption sub-aggregate varies considerably by countiy in Nepal, home-produced food items constitute more than half of food consumption, while in Souith Aica they compri\"se less than 10 per rent of food connqumption It is even more obvious that the extent of non-purchased food varies within countries, particularly between rural and urban sectors, but also within rural areas according to the level of living. As a result, failure to capture the value of consumption from home-production is likelyto overstate both poverty and fairly comprehensive list of food items (a) during a relatively short reference period, such as the last two weeks, and / or (b) during a typical month in which such purchases were made. Data are often collected on the total amount spent on purchasing each food item, and sometimes also on the quantities purchased, during the specified reference period. Calculating the food purchases sub-aggregate involves converting all reported exper:.^e on~ food nc it1,, 1U61'1% expenditures across all food items purchased by the household. In surveys where information on food purchases has been collected for more than one recall period, thequestion arises as to which of the two sources of information should be used. Note once again that, in these guidelines, we are not concerned with how the data should be collected and what reference periods should be used, but rather with the decisions that must be made by an analyst wno is confronted with multuple measures 1 an already y. Conlsumptionn survevy-includirng LSMS sqirvevs-have used several diffe-mrent designs in collecting consumption data, from a single question about purchases over the last two weeks, to multiple visits each with much shorter recall periods, to repeated visits over the year designed to capture seasonal variations in consumption patterns. There is large (but far from decisive) literature on the benefits and costs of these different designs, much of which is reviewed in the context of LSMS surveys in Deaton and #-At should choose the altemative that is likely to provide the most accurate estimate of annual consumption for each household, not for households on average. In perhaps the ideal (but most expensive) case, where in each \"season\" the household has been visited on several occasions, estimates should be made of consumption in each of the seasons, and the seasonal totals added to get annual consumption. In most surveys, this will not be an op.UIo, d (or shorter period) measure, and a \"usual month\" measure. The literature reviewed in Deaton and Grosh leads to a recommendation in favor of the latter over the former, at least for the present purpose. The former tends to be biased by progressive forgetting, as well as the occasional intrusion of (especially well- remembered) purchases from outside the period. The latter has the advantage of being closer to the concept that we want-usual consumption is a better weifare meas-ure than what actually happened in the las two -weeks, whi.-.h eniild have been unusual for any number of reasons--and reduces nroblems with seasonalitv. but will suffer from measurement error if respondents find it difficult to calculate a reasonable answer. In any case, and whenever possible, data from very short reference periods should be avoided. Over a period of a day or two, purchases are quite unrepresentative of consumption. Averaged over a large number of households, mean purchases will still be accurate for mean consumption, but dispersion will be exaggerated, with rpt,ldl are not suitable for the construction of consumption aggregates for welfare purposes. The total value of meals consumed outside the household (restaurants, prepared foods purchased from the market place) should also be included in the food consumption aggregate, as should the value of meals L4ZII by I3 UalOULldU,-.L..bJL ask%L lAPL.ILtL1y about the total value of meals taken outside the home by all household members; this amount should also be included in the food consumption aggregate. In some cases, however, it is impossible to disentangle expenditure on some meals taken outside the home from other related (and more aggregate) non-food 26expenditures such as miscellaneous schooling expenses, total expenditure on vacations, etc. reported elsewhere in the questionnaire. This need not be cause for concern as long as these expenditures are included in the o ve-r-al IlJ Ulu ie. Almost all LSMS questionnaires contain a separate set of questions or module on consumption of home-produced food items. Here it is more common to find questions only on the amount of home-produced food items consumed in a typical month (rather than in the past 2 weeks), as well as the number of months each food item is typically consumed in a year. Data are often coliected on both the totai value and quantity of consumntion of each home-produced food item The home-production food sub-aggregate can th.us be calculated by adding the reported value of consumption of each of the home-produced food items in a manner analogous to that followed in the case of food purchases. in principle, it is possibie to calculate the food home-production sub-aggregate using pr_es from the fnfood prkchases section. However, a pointed - section 2.8 above, and to the extent possible, \"farm-gate\" prices should be used when imputing values to home-produced food items. Moreover, home-produced food items consumed by the household may not be comparable in quality to items traded in the market place. Households' own valuation of the amount they would expect to receive (pay) if they had sold (bought) the home-produced food items that they consume are therefore likely to be a m.uch better estLUm4,ates derived using prevailing market prices from the food purchases section. In most LSMS questionnaires, food received as payment in-kind, as well as in the form of gifts, remittances, etc., are usually lumped together into one set of questions (usually on total value of consumption .._ .---. -_ --_ I of Iood aerved from these sources should be added to the overall food aggregate, if it is not already imnlicitly included in the home-produced food sub-aggregate described above.

Tn such caseq- it may still he pnosihle to uSe data from the agrictultire section to dtpnve an es,t.i Em, te ofthe total value of home-produced food items. The section on crop production of most LSMS surveys typically includes a question of the type: \"How much of ..[crop].. did your household keep for consumption at home?\" as well as questions on dairy and other livestock products that the household consumed from its own 2I -7production, so this information, in conjunction with data on prices, can be used to calculate the total value of home-produced food consumption. was calculated from the \"Agro-Pastoral Activities\" section of the questionnaire, because the section on \"Food Expenditure and Consumption\" collected data on food purchases only. Exclusion ofthese items from the food consumption aggregate would have resulted in underestimating average food consumption by 30 per cent. Furthermore, because the share of home-produced food in rural areas was much higher than estimating the welfare of rural compared to urban households. Because all LSMS surveys collect information on total value of the food item consumed (for both pur- chased and non-purchased foods), the question of assigning monetary values does not arise. However, in surveeys wvhe-re datw iae cected on both va'ue as of food ite consuimied, it may oe utax due to interviewer error-or a varietv of other reasons-we find households consuming non-zero quantities of a particular item, but where data on the total value of consumption may be missing. In such instances, the question arises as to what prices to use to value food consunption of these items -(i) average or median prices calculated from the survey data for other households, (ii) prices from the price (conmmunity) questionnaire, or else (iii) prices from some otner externai source? Faced with a choice of prices, the best choice is usually the one that offers the closest approximation to the amount actually paid. Except where there is a large choice of quality, the values reported by the household are likely to be better guide than market prices, if only because they record actual, not hypothetical transactions. When such data are not available, the analyst can construct prices from the data for other h1, 1 IA J L%A FtjaLU U) other households in the same cluster. When these data are not available, there is no choice but to use prices reported by other households in the same sub-region, district, division, or province, depending on whichever is the next higher level of aggregation for which price information is available. When making such substitutions, great care must be exercised, particularly through checking that the prices being imputed are reasonable. Mrech1anical imputatiVon different, witi catastrophic conseauences for consumDtion agzregates. In one famous example, a survey imputed a value for water collected by households from local wells by using the geographically nearest price for purchased water, which in this case turned out to be imported bottled water from a French spa. By this remarkable imputation, 28rural households were given living standards well in excess of their urban counterparts. 3.3: Consumntion LII-.nVoU iLt.-.^ For example, data are collected on consumption of daily-use items such as soap and cleaning supplies, kerosene and petrol, newspapers, tobacco, stationary and supplies, recreational expenses and miscellaneous personal care items, as well as other less frequently purchased items such as clothing, footwear, kitchen equipment, household textiles such as sheets, curtains, bedcovers, etc., and other household use items. Data are also collected on education and health expenditures for all nousehold members. Expenditures on nousenold utilities are tvnicallv collected in the housing module- and for households that have small hbuines enterpn:ses, that module can provide information on non-food items that were produced for home consumption. Finally, these questionnaires typically also solicit information on other infrequent expenses such as legal fees and expenses, home repair and improvements, taxes and levies, as well as expenditure on social ceremonies, marriages, births, and funerais, etc. The actual computation of an annual non-food consumption aggregate is straightforward. The difficulties lie in the choice of which items to include. The choice depends not only on which data are available, but also on the analytic objectives of the study being undertaken. However, there are a few general issues that apply to most LSMS survey data and for the standard welfare analyses; these are taken up later in Unlike many homogeneous food items, most non-food goods are too heterogeneous to permit the collection of information on quantities consumed-exceptions are some fuels, like kerosene or electricity, and some transportation items-so that LSMS surveys collect data only on the value of non-foods purchased over Ulr.e .-efe.-e.

Constructing the non-food aggregate thus entails converting all these reported amounts to a uniform reference period-say one year-, and then aggregating across the various items. As far as singling out which non-food \"exnenditures\" should be excluded from the consumntinn aggregates, some choices are straightforward. Expenditures on taxes and levies are not part of consumption, but a deduction from income, and should not be included in the consumption total. An apparent exception can 29sometimes be argued for some local taxes, such as property taxes, that are used to provide local services, such as schools, policing, or garbage collection. In some locations, these taxes bear no relation to services provided and so should not be included in the consumption aggregate. But where such taxes are closely related to services provided, households that are paying more tax are receiving more services, are better off as a result, and A 4-, :-,-u of -;1 t \". d 'e to \" -k --l A;ff o i, piublic goroA pi.vrridni between different households. Commodity taxes are included in the prices of goods, and so (correctly) find their way into the consumption aggregate through the prices-though it is also possible to imagine using reference prices for money metric utility that exclude commodity taxes. In any case, no special treatment is required for commodity taxes. As we have already argued, expenditure on \"regrettable necessities\", such as travel to wvork or wor'-rivelated i.,cuded, u'uU1 bus sx ed - oneration of own-account business must be excluded. These distinctions are much more easily enunciated than implemented; the welfare analyst faces much the same difficulties as does a tax inspector! Some surveys list as \"expenditures\" items that are clearly capital account transactions, such as expenditures for a \"saving club\". All purchases of financial assets, as well as repayments of debt, and interest payments should be excluded from the consumption aggregate. More complex is the case of \"lumpy\" and relatively infrequent expenditures such as marriages and dowries, births, and funerals. While almost all households incur relatively large expenditures on these at some stage, only a relatively small proportion of households are likely to make such expenditures during the reference period typically covered by the survey. For instance, in the case of the LSMS survey conducted in p thep past 12 months; however, such expenses constituted 20 per cent of their total annual consumption, Howes and Zaidi (1994). Ideally, we would want to \"smooth\" these lumpy expenditures, spreading them over several years, but lacking the information to do so-which might come, for example, by incorporating multi-year reference periods for such items-we recommend leaving them out of the consumption aggregate. Note be thought of as \"noisy\" measures of the longer-run averaged totals that we would really like to measure. In this sense, measurement error and lumpiness can be thought of together, and the techniques we discuss in Section 6.4 below can be applied to both. Expenditure on healtn is an often lumpy expenditure where a decision almost aiways has to be made. Orn.e argum..e-nt for exclusion is that such ernendiit ure reflects a regrettable inecersity that dnes nothing to increase welfare. By including health expenditures for someone who has fallen sick, we register an increase in 30welfare when, in fact, the opposite has occurred. The fundamental problem here is our inability to measure the loss of welfare associated with being sick, and which is (presumably) ameliorated to some extent by health expenditures. Including the latter without allowing for the former is clearly incorrect, though excluding health expendiLLtLUres d1LtgUeur which pavs for treatment. It is also true that some health expenditures-for example cosmetic expenditures-are discretionary and welfare enhancing, and that it is difficult to separate \"necessary\" from \"unnecessary\" expenditures, even if we could agree on which is which. It is also difficult without special health questionnaires to get at the whole picture of health financing. Some people have insurance, so that expenditures are only \"out of poCket expendiu-res whmcn may be only a small fracton oI the total, while others have none, and may bear the whole cost Simply adding up expenditures will not give the right answer. Yet another approach is a pragmatic one that recognizes that measured health expenditures are a noisy approximation to what we would ideally like to have. As we shall see in Section 6.3 below, the decision about whether to include them in the total depends, not only on the extent of the measurement error, but also on elasticity of health expenditures with respect to totai expenditure. The higher the elasticity, the stronger the Pc2c fnr inet,hicinn Table 3. 2: Elasticity of Health and Education Expenditures Health Exnenditures Education Expenditures Country Year Estifm t- 1.35 46.8 0.43 Nepal 1996 0.75 20.9 0.15 1.65 43.5 0.48 Kyrgyz Republic 1996 0.74 14.3 0.14 0.68 13.1 0.13 Ecuador 94-95 -- -- -- 1.38 46.6 0.37 South Africa 1993 1.14 58.7 0.40 1.32 67.2 0.45 Panama 1997 0.49 Brazil 96-97 0.85 31.0 0.26 1.25 47.9 0.45 The elasticity of expenditure on health was estimated from the LSMS data from the seven countries reviewed for this paper. With the exception of South Africa, the elasticities of health expenditures are estimated to be relatively low (see Table 3.2), a result that should be contrasted with the estimated elasticities for educationai expendiiures, which arc also shown in the table. Given these numbers, and given the measurement probhemns, we think that there is a relatively good case for exliidinog health expenditures in the consumption aggregate. Table 3.2 also shows elasticities for educational expenditures, for which similar issues arise as for health. Although educational expenses are not as irregular as health expenditures, they are located 31at a particular point in the life-cycle, so that, even if all households paid the same for education and had the same number of children, some would appear better-off than others simply by virtue of their age. In this sense, educational expenditures, like health expenditures, would ideally be smoothed over life. There is also the argument that education is an imvestment, not consumpuon, ana snoula be mcluaed m saving, not m me conumpntion aagregate. But we follow standard natinnal income accauntina nraceice and recnmmend that it he included in the consumption aggregate. Another important group of items to consider are items such as consumer durables and housing whose useful life typically spans a time-period greater than the interval for wnich the consumption aggregate is being constructedA. As is not tinh f \"\" a on such items but a measure of the flow of services that they yield. How to calculate this measure of \"user-cost\" for consumer durables and for housing is taken up in more detail in Sections 3.4 and 3.5 respectively. Another group of expenditures are gifts, charitable contributions, and remittances to other households. A case cW* I- -.A. for I;A.clu e '.oU transmitting household as do other consumption expenditures that could have been made with the funds. However, their inclusion in the consumption aggregate would involve double-counting if, as one would expect, the transfers show up in the consumption of other households.

Wue uie-refore r;mmend excludiig gifts and transfers, counting them as they are spent by their recipients. Finally, there are various miscellaneous non-food items that are worth mentioning. Expenditures at weddings and funerals are another lumpy and occasional item. In some countries, these expenditures are really transfers-to tne bride and groom, or to tneir parents-and shouid probably be treated as such and excluded frnm the aggoregate Their tranitoriness w econcluscin-n hnusehoJds ownx. sm.1l enterprises which produce goods for own-consumption; such items should be treated analogously to home- produced food, priced as well as is possible in the circumstances, and added to the total. There are also a number of non-foods received as payment in kind; housing subsidies, transport to work, and education are probably the most important examples. In principle, all such items should be valued and included though, as -l1,, rnn th^. fl.lUL41VLsl error on the other, again see Section 6 below. Expenditures on utilities, water, gas, electricity, or telephone can also be problematic if some households are subsidized and some are not. For example, some households may 32receive high quality piped water at little or no cost, while others have to buy expensive, inconvenient, and lower quality water from local vendors. In some cases, making accurate regional (and certainly international) welfare comparisons will make it necessary to make corrections to (by repricing) the reported expenditures. 3.4 Consumer durables: From the point of view of household welfare, rather than using expenditure on purchase of durable goods during the recall period, the appropriate measure of consumption of durable goods is the value of se(VYCe ULL the \"user cost\" or \"rental eQuivalent\" for durable goods is apDroximately: where S, p, is the current value of the durable good, r, -r, the real rate of interest, and a the rate of depreciation for the durable good. Although in theory, r, is the general nominal rate at time t, and ;rt is the s-pecific rate of ifIUaLion for each durable good at tLime t, il practice it is best o collapse he ivWo iinto a siigle real rate of interest. taken as an average over several years. and to use that real rate for all durable goods. Almost all LSMS surveys collect data on the stock of durable goods currently owned by the household. However, the amount of detailed information collected about each durable good varies quite considerably across surveys. 1 nerefore, depending on uie type of data avaiiabie, tne analyst must cnoose between a number of different strategies when using (3 1) to estimate the durahle oods connumntion -mbh-am-ewate In the case of the Vietnam and Nepal LSMS surveys, the \"Inventory of Durable Goods\" module of the questionnaire collected information on (i) the current value of each durable good (S, p,), (ii) the age of the item T in years, as well as (iii) tne value of the item wnen purcnased (S, Pt-rTJ Using WAC th-^. c- mlcuAti-edA fo!!owse: First the depreciation rate 6 for each type of durable good was calculated using: ( .. 'Yr _-r=1_( I V, (3.2) (. Pt-Tij For instance, estimates of 6 -ir calculated from the survey data in Nepal ranged from 13 per cent for television sets, 1'7 per -ert for -A-o=csette I ttA%,D 33estimates were then used, in conjunction with data on the real rate of interest r, -;r, and the current value of durable goods owned by each household S, p,, to calculate the durable goods consumption sub-aggregate. In order to minimize the influence of any outliers in the data, the median value of depreciation rates were used for each of the 16 items for which data were collected (i.e. rather than using household-specific values of 6 s In the case of the Ecuador and Panama data sets, information was available only on (i) current value of durable goods owned by the household St p, as well as (ii) the age of the item T in years. As the value of the item when new was not available in the data sets (i.e. SI P-rT), (3.2) could not be used to calculate the 5 IfIIUws. First, the average age for each durable good, T, is calculated from the data on the purchase dates of the goods recorded in the survey. We then estimate the average lifetime of each durable good as 2T under the assumption that purchases are uniformly distributed through time. (In some cases, for example where a good _____1- -- maue.) I ne remaminig nie oI eacn gooa is then calculated as 2T -T in this case- and somewhat arbitrarilvy this estimate is \"rn'rnded uip\" to 2 yenrc when the estimate was less. A rough estimate of the flow of services is then derived by dividing the current replacement value S, p, by its expected remaining life. For the countries, the interest component in the flow of services was ignored. zr-1 log zr.d .-ezzrgi. it) (3.3) thus, in cases where data are available on the current value and age of the durable good only, using (3.3) 6- it can be estimated by regressing the current value of the durable good on a constant and T (i.e. by assuming that the current value of the durable good when new is a constant). LTi the L_QX' eovgsny fi. Vk UIt stock of durable goods owned by each household. In this case, (3.1) was estimated directly assuming a value of 10 per cent for ( r. -;t, + 6 ), a number that seemed reasonable given the prevailing real rate of interest and plausible values of 6. Finally, in the case of the Brazil and South Africa data sets, consumption of durable goods was not included in the overall consumption aggregate because of unavailability of data. Whenever good 34data are available on the total stock of durable goods owned by the household, we would reconmnend incorporating in the overall consumption aggregate a measure ofthe flow of services accruing to the household from these goods. 3.5: Housing: Of all components of the household consumption aggregate, the housing sub-aggregate is often one of the most problematic. The underlying principle is the same as for other consumer durabies; what is required is a measure rn moneay terms of the flow of services that the household receives from occupying its dwelling. Because house purchase is such a large and relatively rare expenditure, under no circumstances should expenditures for purchase be included in the consumption aggregate. In the hypothetical case where rental markets function perfectly and all households rent their dwellings, the rent paid is the obvious choice to include in the consumption aggregate. Whenever such rental data are available, and provided the rents are a reasonable s 11 itiL1lIr us-- -- al a I. -U11 X A A- ;*% SIkI U-- -9UUX6oU .- KFW t A +1IA - consumption total. In many cases, however, households own the dwelling in which they reside and do not pay rent as such. Others are provided with housing free of charge (or at subsidized rates) by their employer, a friend, a relative, government, or other sucn entities. Iim many LSMS surveys, non-renter households are as'&ed how Muc-h it w ^uld cost them if they had to rent the dwelling in which they reside. and this \"implicit rental value\" can be used in place of actual rent. Such measures must be treated with caution and carefully inspected prior to use. Implicit rent is a hypothetical concept, perhaps to the interviewer as well as to the respondent, and the numbers reported may not always be credible or usable. Even when people are apparently confident about their estimates, they may do a very poor job of reporting market rents. Rents inown to them may be subsidized, out of at.e, or in. sorm.e .w. ainrPnresenentntive of the g.nernl run of nronertv in their area The hardest cases arise when there are data on neither actual nor imputed rent. In the case ofthe South African LSMS, in addition to information on rents, data were collected on the total property value (i.e. current sale value) of the dwelling. For households who reported property values but neither actual nor imputed rents, +Ult locAb UnAa.r;Jn ft L LI. = .lWS of I j to propeivIe tOi used ... * ir.puted r*tt*l. Tin WVc Wlher the property value of the dwelling was also missing, a median property value per room was used in each locality to assign a property value to the dwelling based on the total number of rooms, and the estimated property value used to estimate its rental value. 35In the Nepal and Kyrgyz Republic LSMS data sets, hedonic housing regressions were used to impute a value of housing consumption wherever information on rents was missing. The idea behind this approach is to estimate an econometric model in which rents reported by a subset of the population (either actual or reported, as the case may be) are regressed on a set of housing characteristics including, for instance, the number of rooms and m.easures of quiality of flnnri, innntriinicn maternia1 of walls, t,Vpe of sanitation, etc. as well as regional dummies. The parameter estimates obtained from this model are then used to calculate rents for that segment of the population for which data on rents are missing. In cases where data on imputed rental value for non-renting households are not available, or where Well estnimtsaLre dee-..e Le +U- .m (zs iAs tLe case, for instance, in rural areas in some countries), the hedonic regression approach can also be used to impute rents for such households. The regression model is first estimated using rent paid by renter-households as the dependent variable; the results of the model are then used to impute rents for the rest of the population. Because there may be systematic differences in characteristics between renters-and non-renter and Trost (1978) and Malpezzi and Mayo (1985). Finally, in cases where data on rental value are not available for both renters as well as non-renters, or where the percentage of the population renting their dwelling unit is so small as to make estimation of a hedonic housing model unfeasible, data on property values can be used to estimate the value of housing consumnpion. Followingarnanaprarlhsimilar tnthatii ed for conRil mer diirahle. oitlined earlier in Re.tinn 34 the value of the flow of services received by the household from housing can be calculated by using an appropriate guesstimate of the user cost per unit to derive a measure of housing consumption from the total property or \"stock value\" of the dwelling. This was the approach used in the case of the Vietnam LSMS data set. Once again, it is necessary to warn against the mechanical application of these (and other related) procedures. In some countries, housing and rental markets are not well enough developed to permit any serious estimate of rental value, and attempts to repair the deficiency using data from a small number of households are unlikely to be effective, however sophisticated the econometric technique. Even if there is information on rents Hi someu par s VIof. wuleoltyIt iS 4LU UUMlMUIVL1lU IjLes sometimes do no more than disguise the Droblem. In extreme cases. the best available solution may simplv be to exclude the housing component for all households. 36Note finally that data related to expenditures on water, electricity, garbage collection, and other such utilities and amenities are usually collected in the housing module of LSMS questionnaires. They should also be included in the housing sub-aggregate, and in the measure of totai expenditure. 37Box 2.

Education expenses: Typically measured quite accurately in most surveys -our recommendation is to include them. Work-related expenses: To the extent possible, purely work-related expenditures should be excluded. This recommendation does not include transport to work or work clothing. Exclude taxes paid, purchase of assets, repayment of loans, expenditure on durable goods and housing, as well as other lumpy expenditures such as marriages and dowries. To the extent that local property taxes bear a relation to services rendered, we recommend their inclusion. Durable Goods Calculate an annual rental equivalent using an appropriate real rate of interest and median depreciation-values for each item calculated across all households owning that item. Housing If a household pays rent, annualize the amount of rent paid. Even if the dwelling is owned by the household or received free | of charge, an estirate of the annual rental equivalent must be included in the consumption aggregate. In countries where few households pay rent, rental equivalents are potentially inaccurate, and the benefits of completeness need to be weighted against the costs of error. l Weights or Raising Factors | If households interviewed in the survey had differing probability of being selected in the survey sample, household \"weights\" I (also known as expansion a raising factors) should be included in the data. Remember to use these when deriving l representative statistics for the entry under consideration. 38A A i^ Z~L3s^ 4.1 Introduction: In this' Section, we lay out some of the practical issues involved in calculating the price indexes that are used to deflate the nominal consumption aggregate. As we saw in the theory section, the caiculation of money mn,etrn utility reqnires that the index i.n u,hieh the wPeights vary from household to household. If the analyst prefers to work with the welfare ratio approach to measurement, the deflator is a Laspeyres index whose weights are the same for all households. We present the price indexes in that order, which follows our recommendation in favor ofthe money metric approach. We note that these price indexes are of independent interest beyond their roles in deflating expenditures, simply for r.ea...g prices. Price indexes are used to aggregate a large number of individual prices into a single number, so that individual prices are the raw material for the indexes. In LSMS and other surveys, there are several possible sources for the prices, see Deaton and Grosh (1998) for further discussion of how prices can be collected and I.Le fUL source is the survey itself, and the reports of purchases by the households surveyed. In many (but not all) surveys, households report both quantities and expenditures for most of the foods they purchase (three kilos of rice for 5 rupees) as well as for a few non-food items where quantities are well-defined, fuels being the obvious example. Dividing expenditures by quantities gives \"unit values\". These are affected by quality choices; someone wno buys beiter cuts of meat wili pay more per unit, but experience snows that the spatial variation of unit values is closely related to price variation. As a result; unit values provide good price informationn especially when averaged over households in a cluster. The second source of price information is a dedicated price questionnaire, often admninistered in each cluster as part of a community questionnaire. T ne price questionnaire seeks to measure prices in the markets aurt1al.lu need. Tn practice, there may be some compromise of data quality from the fact that the investigators do not actually make purchases. There are also sometimes problems of locating a wide enough range of homogeneous goods in all the relevant markets, so that it may be hard to match prices from the questionnaire with the expenditure patterns of the households in the survey. But this is the preferred source of price information when quantities are- not away from home, where quantity observation is not possible in principle. The third source of price data is ancillary data, for example from government price surveys. This is typically a source of last resort. Such data are often thin on the ground, and there will often be many householdQswhoe nenrest obsezrvedp nrie ic irrelevant. Neve.rtheless, such dnta sre sometimes the only information available, and it is usually better to use them than to make no correction at all. Note finally that the situation is somewhat different depending on whether we need to compute price indexes over space or over time. In the latter case, for example when we are comparing two surveys for the how much the general price level has changed between the two surveys. In the absence of spatial data on prices, the temporal index should be used to deflate all nominal expenditures to ensure that welfare comparisons between the two periods are not being driven by inflation. BJeflUr LLLLILUr, ln Uto welfare-ratio utilities, whereby each is expressed as total expenditure deflated by a price index. For money metric utility, we have from (2.6) that n .a x U a ;Z ^ =- - (4.1) p P _ O _ h (4.2)P *q Here, the weights for the price index are the quantities consumed by the household itself and therefore differ from one household to another. By contrast, welfare-ratio utility uses a Laspeyres index so that, from (2.10) h h...

In this section, we focus on the calculation of (4.2) and (4.4) using the data from a typical LSMS survey. 4.2 PaascIe price index: It is useful to express (4.2) in a manner that makes it easier to see how the Paasche index could be calculated from the type of data typically collected in an LSMS survey. Equation (4.2) can also be rewritten in inme orm: Wk k k *(p /p (4.5) where w. is the share of household h's budget devoted to good k. This formula can be calculated from expenditure data and price relatives alone. The following approximation may also be used: In ph Wk iFkJ (4.6) Note that these indexes involve, not only the prices faced by household h in relation to the reference prices, UUL also I.householdU distinction is an important one; to convert total expenditure into money metric utility, the price index must be tailored to the household's own demand pattern, a demand pattern that varies with the household's income, demographic composition, location, and other characteristics. -0 l ne reerencV price veir p iemvitably seiected as a mauer of convenience, bui snould noi be very different from prices actually observed. A good choice is to take the median of the nrices observed from individual households (for foods and fuels, if unit values are collected) or from the community questionnaire (otherwise). Especially when using the unit values from individual records, there will be some outliers, not only for the usual reasons, but also because there are often misunderstandings about units--such as eggs being reported in dozens instead of in units. Use of medians rather than means reduces sensitivity to such accidents.

In general, even if quantities and unit values are available at the household level, this will only be the case for a limited set of goods, typicaily foods and perhaps some fuels. For nonfoods, and pernaps some foods, price relatives will come from communitv auestionnaires or even other regional sources. and will not be available at the household level. In such cases, we must use the price relative that seems most appropriate for each household, in which case (4.6), for example, becomes In Pp= 'wIn( P /kp.) + 5 wln(p,/p,) (4.7) k.F keNF where F denotes the set of goods (foods) for which we have individual household price relatives, and NFis the set where we do not (nonfoods), and the superscript c denotes a cluster or regional price.

The most straightforward procedure is simply to take means (or better. medians) within the relevant region or season of the individual Paasche indexes as calculated above. Such indexes could be made more relevant to the poor by averaging the individual household price indexes only over those at or below the poverty line, see the next subsection for discussion of procedures. Note that when all households within a region R face he isame prices, so th-at 1ph =EWi( Pt/ PW) (4.8) the average of the (log) prices is Riven by In ppR= Wk households. Note that is not the same as using the weights defined as the share of aggregate purchases in 42aggregate total expenditure, weights that are typically used in computing consumer price indexes by statistical offices. These aggregate weights effectively weight each household, not on a \"democratic\" basis, with one household or individual getting equal weight, but on a \"plutocratic\" basis in which each household is weighted according to its total expenditure. Because better-off households have, by definition, larger total expenditures, Uid hUaL causes problems when relative prices change in a way that affects the Door and the rich differently. For example, if the relative price of a staple food rises, a plutocratic price index will rise by less than a democratic price index if the staple is a necessity, and the poverty-increasing effects of the price change will be understated. 4.3 Calculating laspeyres index: For researchers who wish to follow the welfare-ratio rather than money-metric approach to measuring living standards, the relevant price index is not the Paasche index (4.2), but the Laspeyres index (4.4). Because this index uses the same weights for all households, it is typically more straightforward to caiculate than is the Pascehe, though in hnth ec twrire re1ntivrec na raolltn t1Fsvnlt again, it is often useful to write the Laspeyres in terms of budget shares and price relatives so that, corresponding to (4.5), we now have pi z f Wk , (4.10)p .q Pk) which corresponds to (4.4) or, aitematively, corresponding to (4.6), } L EWk i A n (4.11) The discussion of measuring price relatives for foods and non-foods, and of aggregation over households goes through as before, though when we average the Laspeyres indexes, only the price relatives are being averaged, not the weights, though the principle of averaging price indexes over households remains uncnanged. The welfare ratio approach requires comparison of actual indifference curves with a baseline indifference curve, here taken to be the poverty-line indifference curve, and the theory requires that the weights for the Laspeyres index used for deflation be calculated at that indifference curve. In practice, it may not be 43obvious how to do this. There are usually many households near the poverty line, though rarely many (or even any) exactly at it, so we lack the data for the quantity or budget share weights in (4.10) and (4.11). A useful solution to this problem is to calculate weights by averaging over the expenditure patterns of households near the poverty line, with those closer to it given more weight than those further away. Weights with this property are conveniently provided by a \"kernel\" function, here denoted Kh(.) and the weigits in (4.4), or H jjk = Kr(xh z)wk (4.12) h-I This sum is a weighted average over al households in the sample of the budget shares w using the k l-...l We.1iUts. The.re are posibel.-, r.ust sum to one over all households, and which must be smaller the larger is the absolute difference between xh and the poverty line z. One convenient choice is the \"bi-square\" function I ( _ _,) -z) = 0, otherwise. (4.14) The nuimbe-r T iS a \"bandwidth\" that controls how many households are included in the samnple. The larger is T, the more households are used, which makes the average more precise, but can cause bias by including households a long way from the poverty line. In practice, setting T so as to include a few hundred households around the poverty line will usually be satisfactory. These equations are also likely to work better if xtL and z in (4.12) to (4.14) are replaced by their logarithms, so that distances from the poverty line are m.easued proporti,onat.el.y, not absolut.e1\". Note finally, that although different price indexes will sometimes be similar, it is dangerous to assume that this will always be true. Because of poorly developed infastructure, relative prices sometimes vary a good deal from one place to another, and when this is the case, price indexes are sensitive to the weights used to construct ulVIII. ,oeU uauil , sO uIal because household level demand patterns are quite variable, the (apDroDriate) deflation of total expenditure by the household level Paasche index will generally give different money metric utility ranilings than will (the 44inappropriate) deflation by local (e.g. Laspeyres) indexes that do not vary from household to household. Even when price data are sparse, and only available for a few regions, it is still desirable to calculate the household- specific indexes, not because prices vary from one household to another within the same region, but because the weights do. Our recommendation here follows from our original recommendation for the use of money metric utility. Money metric utility is calculated by deflating nominal consumption expenditures by the Paasche index (4.5) and (4.6), and that is what we recommend using. Calculation of the Laspeyres index might be marginally more convenient-though given the other household specific calculations, constructing household specific 5.1 introduction: Sections 3 and 4 have presented guidelines on how to use LSMS data to construct a nominal measure of totai household consumption and of how to adjust it to take into account cost-of-living differences.

If it were possible to gather data on consumption by individual family members, we could move directly from the data to individual welfare, but except for a few goods, such data are not available, even conceptually-think of public goods that are shared by all household members. As it is, the best that can be done is to adjust total household expenditure by some measure of the number of people in the ik;vsul Equivalence scales are the deflators that are used to convert household real expenditures into money metric utility measures of individual welfare. If a household consists entirely of adults, and if they share nothing, each consuming individually, then the obvious equivalence scale would be household size, which is uhI children, welfare is often assessed by dividing expenditures by household size, as a rough-and-ready concession to differences in family size. However, such a correction does not allow for the fact that children typically consume less than adults, so that deflating by household size will understate the welfare of people who live in households with a high fraction of children. Moreover- simply deflating household expenditures hy total household size askn meane implircitly ignoring any economies of scale in consumption within the household. Some goods and services consumed by the household have a \"public goods\" aspect to them, whereby consumption by any one member of the household does not necessarily reduce the amount available for consumption by another person within the same household. Housing is an important household public goods, at least up to some limit, as are durable ite l;ka UVO. bCrwV e at di.=-l- times. Because people can share some goods and services, the cost of being equally well-off does not rise in proportion to the number of the people in the household. Per capita measures of expenditure thus understate the welfare of big households relative to the living standards of small households. In. tUis SetIon wie discuss equi-valen.ce scales in geInera and o-utline some of thie miiairn approaches io 46their calculation. But before doing so, it is worth emphasizing that we do not recommend abandoning the use of per capita expenditure. Twenty years ago, per capita expenditure was itself something of an innovation, and many studies worked with total household expenditure or income without correction for household size. In the oa- '- A A 414- +A cap none of the alternatives discussed have been able to command universal assent. As a result, no calculation of welfare or poverty profile should ever be done without the calculation of per capita expenditure as at least one of the alternatives. In part, this recommendation reflects the burden of the past; results are almost always compared with previous analyses for the same country, or with similar analyses for otner couiLiris w'nici use per caLpita expVndi Ure. But It is also tneui tait v years of vxperiee -w-ith per cupiw expenditure has given analvsts a good working understanding of its strengths and weaknesses. when it is sound (in most cases), and when it is likely to be misleading (for example, in comparisons of the average living standards of children and the elderly.) 5.2 Equivalence scales: To make welfare comparisons across households with different size and demographic composition, we need some way of adjusting aggregate consumption measures to make them comparable across households. In this regard, just as a price index is used in order to make comparable consumption levels of households with different cost-of-living, equivaience scales are a way to make comparable consumption in. thin literature to calculate the exact conversion factors used in each particular set of equivalence scales, the underlying principle is often the same: the basic idea is that various members of a household have \"differing needs\" based on their age, sex, and other such demographic characteristics, and that these differing needs should be taken into account when making welfare comparisons across households. The costs of children relative to adults and the extent of economies of scale are of the first-order of importance for poverty and welfare calculations. Indeed, the direction of policy can sometimes depend on exactly how equivalence scales are defined. Larger households typically have lower per capita expenditure levels than small households but until we know the extent of economies of scale, we do not know which group 1i bULLtr ofl, Lulur. Rurdl hliuseolius a re often larger than urban households, and we are sometimes unable to compare rural with urban poverty without an accurate estimate of the extent of economies of scale. Another frequent comparison is between children and the elderly, and both groups have claims for public attention on grounds of poverty. Children tend to live in larger households than do the elderly, and (obviously) live in households with a higher fraction of children. As 47a result, comparisons of welfare levels between the two groups are often sensitive to what is assumed about both child costs and about economies of scale, see the calculations in Section 6 below. Issues involving comparison between children and the elderly have acquired a new salience in work on the transition economies of Eastern Europe wnich, compared with developing countries of Africa or Asia, have relatively large elderly the two aoru n are in competition for welfare support, and an accurate assessment of their relative poverty has become an important issue. Unfortunately, there are no generally accepted methods for calcuiating equivalence scales, either for 4m.e .elah'vr cots of nhulArnn for Mr vu,or. annp.roac. to Am--nrn-- equivalence scales: (i) one relying on behavioral analysis to estimate equivalence scales, (ii) one using direct questions to obtain subjective estimates, and (iii) one that simply sets scales in some reasonable, but essentially arbitrary, way. Each of these is discussed in turn in the sections that follow. Our recommendation, apart from the continuing use of per capita expenditure, is the arbitrary method, and we offer some suggestions for its .r-pcil tlnpICL;LMUUM 5.3 Behavioral approach: The behavioral approach has generated a large literature, much of which is reviewed in Deaton (1997). 'Wnhile there are metiods for calc-ulating t,e costs of children utat arc relatively soundly based -tiough not all woulld agree even with this -- there are so far no satisfactorv methods for estirnatinL economies of scale. Manv of the standard methods, such as Engel's procedures for calculating both child costs and economies of scale, are readily dismissed, see again Deaton (1997) and Deaton and Paxson (1998). One idea that seems correct, and that can sometimes give a useful if informal notion of the extent of economies of scale, is that shared goods within the household, or household public goods, are the root cause of economies of scale. In the simplest case, .- e two sor of g i to h F l*- --1 .--old, prgi -.. e byor.e o.d o r person only and where consumption by one person precludes consumption by another, and public goods, where there is an unlimited amount of sharing, and where consumption by one member of the household places no limitation on consumption by others. In this case, Dreze and Srinivasan (1997) have shown that, in a household with only adults, the elasticity of the cost-of-living with respect to household size is the share of private goods inILU4 11Uo while if all goods are public, costs are unaffected by the number of people. This sort of argument supports the intuitive notion that, in very poor economies with a high share of the budget devoted to food- which is almost entirely private-the scope for economies of scale is likely to be smali. In other settings, where 48housing-which has a large public component-is important, economies of scale are likely to be larger. Unfortunately, attempts to extend this sensible approach to a more formal estimation of the extent of economies of scale have not been successful, Deaton and Paxson (1998). 5.4 Subjective approach: The subjective approach to setting equivalence scales has attracted increased attention in recent years. One widely used technique is the \"Leyden\" method pioneered by van Praag and his associates, see van Praag and Wamaar (1997) for a recent review. In the household survey, each household is asked to provide estimates o~f th.e am .t of i,nmnp it that the answer to the \"good\" question by household h is ch. From the cross-section of results, Ch is regressed on household income and family size (or numbers of adults and children) in the logarithmic form ln ch = a + f In _ .~~~~- nousenolu woua nave lo nave m oruer to name its actual income as \"good.\" Evidently, this is given by In yh = + p In nh (5.2) 1-;v 1-Y ii^ y is interpreted as a measure of needs in that it wouid be regarded by a househoid receiving it as goano \"thpen the nii2nrtitv hn1,cPehnId Sj7'e (a measure of economies of scale. van Praag and Warnaar report an estimate of,B / (1 -y) for the Netherlands of 0. 17, 0.50 for Poland, Greece, and Portugal, 0.33 for the US.

One useful approach, detailed in National Research Council (1995), is to define the number of adult equivalents by the formula AE=(A+aK)K (5.3) wnere A is ne numnber of aduits in e nousenoid, and k is me number o c'iidren. i ne parameter a is me cost of a rhild relative to that of an ad1ult, and lieS s-mewhere between 0 and 1. The nther parameter, 0, whic*h also lies between 0 and 1, controls the extent of economies of scale; since the elasticity of adult equivalents with respect to \"effective\" size, A + a K is 0, (1 -9) is a measure of economies of scale. When both a and Oare unity-the most extreme case with no discount for children or for size-the number of adult equivalents is simply household size, and deflation by household size is equivalent to deflating to a per capita basis.

Acae eauivalents. simplv setting a and 0 at sensible values. Most of the literature -as well as common sense - suggests that children are relatively more expensive in industrialized countries (school fees, entertainment, clothes, etc.) and relatively cheap in poorer agricultural economies. Following this, a could be set near to unity for the US and westem Europe, and perhaps as low as 0.3 for the poorest economies, numbers that are consistent with estimates based on Rothbarth's procedure for measuring child costs, Deaton and Muelrbauer (18ORI) nid Dle2ton (1997). PYiqtPnr-e pu mih goods in the household, then Owill be high when most goods are private and low when a substantial fraction of 50household expenditure is on shared goods, see Section 5.3 above. Since households in the poorest economies spend as much as three-quarters of their budget on food, and since food is an essentially private good, economies of scale must be very limited, and 9 should be set at or close to 1. In richer economies, 9 would be lower, er.iaps.nI'u. _eio of 0.,5. In Section 6 below, we argue that it is important to assess the robustness of poverty comparisons using stochastic domninance techniques, and we sketch out a simnple methodology for doing so. When the results are not robust, for example when the comparison of poverty rates between children and the elderly is sensitive to the cnoice of a and 6 within thle sensibie range for that couniry, there is probaDby not aiternauve to farinog failuire snqarelv. Certainly the behavioral nnmroacrh is unlikely to nrovide estimates that would he sufficiently precise and sufficiently credible to support such fine distinctions. In such situations, it might be better to turn to other indications of well-being, such as mortality or morbidity. When the analyst is not concerned with situations in which everything depends on the choice of a and 9-for example in comparing the poverty of children and the eiderly-our recommendations are straightforward. At the first \"i alternative, and likely more accurate supplement, use the arbitrary method, with values of a and 9 set according to the level of development. In poor economnies, we reconunend setting a low, perhaps 0.25 or 0.33, and setting 9 high, perhaps 0.9. Children are not very costly in poor, agricultural economies, and when the budget share of food is high, there is not much scope for economies of scale. As we move to richer economies, child.JU1-er. z-e- meloatti;ely se\"-.g#- -U- parameters to 0.75 for the US, and others have noted that the official US poverty lines are quite well approximated by setting a to be 0.5 and 9 to be unity.

METHODS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS 6.1 Introduction: Although the general procedures for calculating money metric utility are well-defined in theory, in practice, compromises have to be made, and difficult choices have to be made between imperfect alternatives. Is it better to add in a poorly measured component of consumption-sucn as imputed rent, or a component ain at-t-emnr-tr-t at cfrnmn-etenes-- Decisions about equivalence scales are almost always controversial, and even if we use the formulas (5.3) or (5.4), how do we know that the results are robust to the choice of parameters that control child costs and economies of scale? Even with perfect estimates of money metric utility, poverty analysis is subject to its own inherent uncertainty associated with the difficulty of choosing a poverty iine. Although there is much to be said for malidnrr theP best der.cisions one prPesinge ah it icn> informative to examine the sensitivity of key results to alternatives. In recent years, much use has been made of stochastic dominance analysis to examine the sensitivity of poverty measures to different poverty lines, and this work has led to a much closer integration between poverty measurement and welfare analysis more generally. Stochastic dominance techniques can also be useful in examining the sensitivity of poverty analyses LU U1, way eqULVa',1eIr, sal. III this Section, we explore some of these issues. Suppose that we ha-ve a money metric utility Measure which, for the mUmeL tIIU LU treUUdc nUoULaLIUW clutter- we denote by x. Su.npose too that we are interested in the headcount ratio (HCR). the .oronortion of people whose money metric utility is below the poverty line z. If F(.) is the cumulative density function of x in the population, F(z) is the fraction below z, and thus is the HCR. The sensitivity of the HCR to changes in z, can be assessed simply by plotting the HCR as a function of z, i.e. by plotting the cdf F(z) as a function of z. Suppose tnen tnat we nave two measures oi money metric utility, xo and x1, corresponding to two different rnskes S-nc to USe th rie Sam pvi'ertv line for both -this will be the case if both are unbiased for the true money metric utility, and neither is more precise than the other. We discuss what happens when this is not the case in the subsections below, though it is sometimes obvious how to adapt the poverty line in moving from one situation to the other. Then if the two cdfs are F, ( and F2 (, the two HCRs are F, (z) and F2 (Z). Plotting both of These functions against z on a s.i..gle. g... how.. ,.4.1, choice ofp rB.f poverty line z.

If the horizontal axis is thought of as the poverty line, each line tells us the fraction of people in poverty corresponding to that poverty line. Putting the two graphs on the same figure tells us how ronust the head count rano willb be o enouAh poverty line helow t Lhe headcount ratio will be higher for measure 2. Between choice of poverty line between Za, and Zb , measure 1 gives the higher poverty count, reversing again above Zb. Given some idea of the relevant poverty line, such figures tell us how the choice of measure affects the headcount. This rather mechanical exercise becomes more interesting when we come to construct poverty proniles, fovr example for Aifferent voups, differ.nt regins. Suppose 54that we have two groups G and H, and that the conditional cdfs of the two measures are now F,( .G ) and F2( .j G) for G with similar expressions for H. What we are typically concerned about is whether the relative pov.rty rates of G arnd H are cp\"a;ve ton Lh.e *hie%bt- hPftp te ftk, o t m.easiiesr arA to .what extent the conclusion depends on the choice of the poverty line. For poverty line z, and measure i, for i equal to 1 or 2, the difference in poverty rates between the two groups is Ai(z)=Fi(zlG) -Fi(zlH). (6.1) Plotting Ai ( z ) against z for a given i, and seeing whether it ever cuts the horizontal axis, tells us WIVUIVI LWU Li functions on the same graDh tells us whether, at any given poverty line, the ranking is sensitive to the construction of the utility measure, and whether that sensitivity (or lack of it) depends on the choice of poverty line. A worked example of this kind of analysis is given in Section 6.3 below. Sensitivity caicuiaiuons ior mie nea-c;ount ratio invoive possible for measures- for example, the sensitivitv of the novertv gan measure to the poverty line can be examined by plotting the areas under the cdfs, see Deaton (1997) for a review of the literature and for examples. These higher order stochastic dominance comparisons can be used in the same way as above to examine the effects of construction on higher-order poverty measures. 6.3 Using subsets of consumption and the effects of measurement error: It is often clear from the data collection exercise or from the subsequent analysis of the data that some components of consumers' expenditure are much better measured than others. Food is sometimes thought to be easier to measure than non-food, if only because in households that eat from a common pot, there is a single we 1ll- .fo..,.edA al vuo can act occupiers in an economy where house tenancy is very rare. As a result, most analysts who have had to work through an LSMS survey, writing code to make the imputations, tend to be rather unwilling to make much use of the subsequent numbers. Whether it is better to use a subset of well-measured expenditures to assess poverty is an important question that has been raised by Lanjouw and Lanjouw (1996). tAs We ulPiuUV air eAper,di.ure item where there are large. occasional expenditures. Transitory expenditure around a longer run mean is effectively the same as measurement error. In the rest of this subsection, we sketch out some results that are useful in thinking about measurement error and transitory expenditure. While we follow the lead of Lanjouw and Lanjouw, there are some differences in the analysis, both in methods and in results. 55Before going on, it is worth noting that instrumental variable techniques for measurement error that are standard for making imputations, or for correcting regression analysis, are of more limited use when we are concermned with meaLuring povertv or inequality. The es-nettial probhl-m is that povertyv and inteqnulitv depend on dispersion, not means, or even conditional means. If we are trying to estimate the mean expenditure of the population on some item, and some households have missing or implausible values, it is standard practice to impute an estimate, often from the mean of similar households, or more generally, from a regression using instruments, variables that are thoughit to be correlated with the missing information. But because such regreacsiins only cape a fraltin of the than the actuals, and imputation will tend to reduce inequality and poverty (if the poverty line is low enough.) Of course, for transitory expenditures and for measurement error, variance reduction is exactly what we want. But imputations are likely to eliminate not only the measurement error, but also the genuine variation across households, something that we need to preserve. Start by assuming that there is a subset of total expenditure, such as food. expenditure on which is denoted by e, and that, conditional on total expenditure, x, we have E(elx)=m(x); V(elx)=2r (61, The regression function m( x ) can be thought of as an Engel curve, or as the true value of x whenx is measured witU error, or tue long-run vaiue of x when x has a large transitory component. h ne poverty line in terms of xis. as before, z, and the cdfofx is FQ. so that the head count ratio is F! z ) Supnose that in qte-ti of defining the poor in terms of low x, we define them in terms of low e; to do so, we must select an appropriate poverty line for e, and one obvious choice is to take the level of e on the Engel curve where total expenditure is equal to the poverty line, i.e. m ( z ). The headcount ratio using e is then given by rs-. = _4 / _ / -It I .-re Fe I lS ( h/ / ko9.3) where Fe.() is the cdf of e. If we assume that m ( x ) is monotone, and therefore invertible, it can be shown that pe is related to the \"true\" headcount ratio pX by the approximation A a 2 f ( (f (z) m(z)) 56where f (x) is the pdf ofx. (This result is closely related to those derived in a somewhat different context by Ravallion, 1988.) Note first that when the Engel curve fits perfectly (or there is no measurement error, or no transitory expenditure), so that a = 0, the two poverty lines coincide, a result that is exact. Otherwise, the two poverty counts will diverge in a way that depends on the slope of the density of x at the poverty line, and on the convexity or concavity of the Engel curve. When the Engel curve is linear or when we are dealing with transitory expendiures or measurement error, uie second term in brackets is zero, so that \"food\" poverty wiii overstate \"true\" poverty if f'( z) > 0 7which will occur if the density ofx is unimodal and the novertv line is below the mode. If this condition holds, the overstatement will be exacerbated if the Engel curve is concave, and moderated if it is convex. These results are a useful starting point, but are not directly practical. if we knew both x and its Cnm.nnnqint e there uiniil hbe nn nrn11nri.es thAat are more useful. The first is the case where m ( x) = x, so that e is just an error ridden measure of x, so that (6.4) becomes Pe tsPr + ay2f'(z) (6.5) which gives us a guide about how measurement error inflates (or deflates) the poverty measure. This formula is ^.1-14c lal se, ..4.1 ,,1- ., could be estimated from two error-ridden but independent measures of x. Note also that (6.5) is the basis for the (often somewhat mysterious) result that for unimodal distributions, where f'(x) is first positive and then negative, adding measurement error increases the head count ratio if the poverty line is below the mode, so that f rz) > 0, and decreases it when the poverty line is above the mode, where f rz) < 0. Except in the very pooiesarea, we UIUUV. The approximation formula is also useful when considering whether or not to include a poorly measured component in the total. To simplify, suppose that e is the noncontroversial component of the total x, so that adding in the controversial component would, in principle, take us to the total x.

This result is perhaps not surprising. A strong link to total expenditure is a case for inclusion, while making the total noisier is a case against conclusion. Note finally that (6.8) can be written in terms of the total-expenditure elasticity of the (u.9) lb a prescription of including controversial items if their total expenditure elasticities are large, provided they do not add too much measurement error. Ofcourse, neither ae nor ac can actually be observed in practice, but the formulas (6.8) and (6.9) tell us what to look for and what to think about when making the decision to trade off comprehensiveness versus precision. 6.4 Sensitvity analysis with equivalence scales: Suppose that we are working with the formula (5.3) that links adult equivalents to the number of adults A and the number of children K according to 58EA=(A + aK)\u00b0 (6.9) and that we do not know a or O, though we may be prepared to commit to a range of values for each. Given values for the two parameters, we can compute money metric utility values for everyone so that, armed with a poverty line, we can calculate poverty rates for any groups. In this context, groups that we are particularly likely to be interested in are children, adults, and the elderly, as well as other groups where househoids have dL A i .t.d cor.J&.fl..ons, such* tas* .t a. ,.fo b. mon sSflt&c. S e. tJ *Jtv v of a, 9, and z, proceeds in very much the same way as discussed in Section 6.1 above. However, as in Section 6.2 but in contrast to Section 6.1, we cannot simply change the parameters and leave the poverty rate unchanged. For example, suppose that a is set at 1, and 0 is reduced from I to 0.5. As a lrsulL, el WU UU *1 fR), V'..W' mY line were held constant, poverty would be decreased. But this is not what we want changes in the parameters of the equivalence scale to do. Instead, we want to alter the relative standings of large households relative to small households, or households with large numbers of children relative to those with none. A straightforward way to do this is to select a particular household type as \"pivot,\" and .to choose the equivalence scale in such a way tiat the money metric utility of people m such houshnoids are unafecteud by changes in the paraneters. Denote the number of adults and children in the reference or nivot household by (Ao .Ko );in practice this should be chosen as the modal type, for example, a two adult and three child household. We then define money metric utility, not as x divided by AE, but as x (+aK 0) \u00b0 F; but .fnr thep .referer.re hn,,csehd,i X is always equal to per capita expenditure, and is unaffected by,changes in a and 9. An alternative procedure, not pursued here but equally useful in practice, is to alter the poverty line for use with equivalent expenditure so as to hold constant the measure of interest, for example the head count I auu. 1LIa 1aE W * dividing total expenditure by equivalent adults calculated using the chosen values of a and 9. For a trial poverty line, calculate the head count ratio, and continue adjusting until the head count ratio returns to its value using per capita expenditure. Equivalently, the ratio of the new to the old poverty lines can be used to deflate expenditure per equivalent, at which point the original poverty line can be used. J7Figures 3-5, reproduced from Deaton and Paxson (1997), show what happens to the relative poverty of children, non-eiderly adults, and the elderly in South Africa using the 1993 South African LSMS. 1flese calculations are done on an individual basis wihPrPey whker. mnen metric ltilityis assigned to ahusehioed, it is assigned to each person in that household. When we are doing population calculations, such as a mean or a measure of dispersion, the money metric utility of the household is weighted by the product of the number of people in the household and the household's sampling weight or inflation factor.

Much of the time, the desired result from a sensitivity analysis is to find ihat the results are robust, so that clear conclusions can be drawn. This will sometimes be the case, but rarely for the analysis of equivalence scales, where we know from a large body of poverty rates of children and the elderly, not only for South Africa, but also for Ghana, Pakistan, Taiwan, and Thailand, but not Ukraine. In the absence of a breakthrough in behavioral and or subjective methods of measuring equivalence scales, it may simply be necessaxy for policy to be conducted in ignorance of the relative poverty of some groups. This section is somewhat more speculative (as well as more technical) than the other sections in these guidelines. Nevertheless, there are a number of general points and recommendations that should be drawn from the analysis. First, to the extent that the welfare measures are to be used for poverty analysis, and in particuiar the (illustrated fnr equivalence scales in this Section) are easy to use and often provide useful insights. That said, these techniques should not be used to check out the results of every controversial decision in constructing the consumption aggregates. There are so many points where judgment calls have to be made, and they combine with one another to produce an impossibly large number of alternatives. Decisions have to be made for better or worse. But there are often. critica decisions, of whirh that ahout equvl.en.ce scales it o..e, an.d the ncluion of a noisy item of expenditure is often another, where we know in advance that the decision is going to matter for the poverty analysis, and where it is important to have more information on exactly how it matters. For this, stochastic dominance analysis is auestion of survey design. The crucial point is always to be aware of it existence, and to ask, every time a decision is made, whether or not that decision would be different depending on the extent of measurement error. We hope that the formulas in Section 6.3, although no panacea, will be helpful in that enterprise. 63Blackorby, Charles and David Donaldson, 1987, \"Welfare ratios and distributionally sensitive cost-benefit analysis,\" Journal of Public Economics, 34, 265-90.

Introduction The World Bank established the Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) in 1980 to explore ways of improving the accuracy, timeliness and policy relevance of household survey data collected by government statistical offices in developing countries. The objective of LSMS surveys is to collect data on many dimensions of household well-being that can be used to assess household welfare, understand household behavior, and evaluate the effect of various government policies on the living conditions of the population. This paper describes the data that have been collected under the LSMS survey program.' ' The World Bank has also supported other household surveys, most notably those under the Social Dimensions of Adjustment (SDA) project for Africa. This paper covers only LSMS surveys because they are the main source of household survey data at the World Bank that are available to outside scholars. * Margaret Grosh and Paul Glewwe are Senior Economists, Development Research Group, The World Bank, Washington, D.

Similarly, data may be included from additional survey rounds in countries already shown. The reader should note that the LSMS program has also assisted surveys in other coun- tries, but because the governments have chosen to handle all dissemination themselves (Latvia, Lithua- nia) or because the data we have received is incomplete or incompletely documented (Mauritania, Morocco, Bolivia, Venezuela), we do not list these in the LSMS archives. \" Code 1 means that no prior permission from government is required to use the data. Code 2 means that such permission is required but the track record for a timely, positive response is good. Code 3 means that, according to PRDPH's best information, a substantial proportion of data requests have been denied, left unanswered, or answered affirmatively only after substantial delays. Since 1985, LSMS surveys have been conducted in nearly 20 developing coun- tries, listed in Table 1. Each year, surveys are done in a few new countries, and several countries that have already conducted surveys carry out new ones. The World Bank provides technical assistance for LSMS surveys. Financing comes from several sources: World Bank loans, grants from other aid agencies, and government funds from the countries implementing the surveys. Each survey project differs in its goals, scope, context and results: some only collect data, some also build capacity for data collection, some even build capacity for data analysis.

Project costs have run from $200,000 to $3 million, with the median being about $750,000. All this variation means that the surveys are not a strictly standardized product, but differ among themselves. In the next section we describe a \"composite prototype\" LSMS survey, though none of the surveys adheres exactly to the definition, and several differ from it in substantial ways. After describing the typical LSMS survey, we briefly review what has been learned from the analysis of LSMS data, discuss the future of LSMS surveys, and explain how LSMS survey data can be obtained. Sample Design, Data Collected and Data Quality LSMS surveys tend to use small samples, usually on the order of 2,000 to 5,000 households. The typical approach is first to draw areas from census-based sampling units (such as census tracts or enumeration districts), and then to draw dwellings from a list of all dwellings within that sampling unit. LSMS surveys usually have equal numbers of dwellings, typically 16, drawn from each sampling unit. The sam- ples are usually representative of the country as a whole and they are large enough to allow consideration of certain subgroups, such as rural vs. urban, or a few major agro-climatic zones. However, the samples are rarely large enough to allow mean- ingful analysis at the state or province level. Although larger samples would reduce sampling errors, they would also be far more difficult to manage well and therefore would tend to have higher non-sampling errors. Moreover, larger samples would also greatly increase the cost of the whole survey effort. In some countries, only one LSMS survey has been done, while in others mul- tiple cross-sectional data sets are available. In a few countries, panel data sets with two or three rounds of data have been collected, often separated by a year. For example, two-year panels exist for Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Jamaica has a four-year panel. The 1992-93 Tanzania survey (Kagera region) interviewed households four times over a period of two years. The series of Peruvian surveys has a panel of households in Lima for 1985, 1990 and 1991, and a nationwide panel exists for 1991 and 1994. By the end of 1998, there will be panel data from Vietnam for two points in time, five years apart. A standard, \"full-size\" LSMS survey normally uses three different kinds of ques- tionnaires: a household questionnaire, a community questionnaire, and a price questionnaire. A fourth type, a school or health facility questionnaire, is sometimes used as well. The household questionnaire collects comprehensive consumption data. There are detailed questions on cash expenditures and on the value of food items grown by the household or received as gifts. In addition, sufficient information is collected on the ownership of housing and durable goods to calculate an annual use value. A wide range of income information is also usually collected. For individuals in formal sector jobs, most surveys contain detailed questions about wages, bonuses This content downloaded from 151.28.174.136 on Sat, 04 May 2019 13:38:33 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 190 Journal of Economic Perspectives and various forms of in-kind compensation. In most surveys, lengthy agriculture and small enterprise modules are included to yield estimates of net household income from these activities. Finally, non-labor income is recorded as well, such as the receipt of private inter-household transfers, public transfers (in cash or in kind), lottery winnings and interest income. Other parts of the household survey collect information on outcomes and behaviors pertaining to education, health, migration, fertility and nutrition. Collecting data on a variety of household characteristics from the same households makes it possible both to describe the multiple dimensions of living standards and to analyze relationships among different dimensions of household welfare and behavior, such as the impact of parents' education on child nutrition or the effect of health status on employment and school enrollment. Information on local conditions that are common to households living near each other is gathered in a community questionnaire. In most countries, these ques- tionnaires have been used in rural areas, where local communities are easier to define than in urban areas. The community questionnaire usually includes the location and quality of nearby health facilities and schools, local agricultural con- ditions and practices, prevailing wage rates for unskilled labor, and the condition of local infrastructure such as roads, sources of fuel, water, electric power and means of communication. The information is provided by interviewing community leaders (mayors, headmen, village elders) and service providers (teachers, health workers, agricultural extension agents) as appropriate depending on the governance struc- ture in the country and the content of the questionnaire. Price questionnaires are important because in many countries, prices vary con- siderably among regions, so information on the prices that households actually face is needed. Thus, most LSMS surveys include short questionnaires to record local prices of commonly purchased goods, including food items, basic non-food goods, medicines and selected agricultural inputs. Sometimes detailed information on the availability, quality or prices of schools or health clinics is desired. When this is the case, special facility questionnaires are developed to supplement and/or replace those sections of the community questionnaire. Concerns are often expressed about the quality of data from developing coun- tries. LSMS surveys are designed and carried out in ways that should produce high quality data. For example, interviewers receive a full mionth of training prior to field work, and supervision ratios are high-one supervisor for every two or three inter- viewers. The design of the household questionnaire includes explicit wording of each question, prompts, skip patterns and detailed interviewer instructions, all of which reduces the potential for variation among interviewers. Interviewers are in- structed to administer the schooling, health, employment, migration and fertility modules individually to each household member, and to avoid having one adult provide answers for another. Data entry and editing are carried out concurrently with field work either in local field offices or by data entry operators who accompany the field teams with laptop computers. The data are checked with custom-designed software programs to minimize data entry errors and to detect inconsistencies and This content downloaded from 151.28.174.136 on Sat, 04 May 2019 13:38:33 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms The World Bank's Living Standards Measurement Study 191 out-of-range values. These can usually be resolved during a second visit to the house- hold. For in-depth discussions of LSMS data quality control procedures see Grosh and Mufioz (1996). These procedures have produced some impressive results (Grosh and Glewwe, 1995, offer further details). Very little data is missing; for example, in four surveys in C6te d'Ivoire, Peru and Ghana, covering 86,827 persons, only 48 persons are missing data on their age. There are also very few missing modules. In C6te d'Ivoire, at least one height and weight measurement was obtained for almost 90 percent of all household members, both children and adults. Internal consistency of the data, which can be checked by comparing answers from different adults within a house- hold, seems quite high. There is less evidence comparing the LSMS data to external sources, but what there is generally finds that the averages from LSMS data are very close to the averages from other sources (Deaton and Grosh, 1997; Bhushan, 1997). Overall, compared to other household surveys conducted in developing countries, the quality of LSMS data is well above average. Research Uses LSMS data have supported work done by hundreds of researchers in recent years, including government analysts, World Bank staff, academics, graduate stu- dents and independent researchers. In this section we review some recent re- search based on LSMS data. Much of the analysis done using LSMS data has focused on documenting reg- ularities concerning the nature of poverty in developing countries. In particular, they have shown that the poor are: disproportionately found in rural areas; very likely to be self-employed (particularly in small-scale agriculture); usually less likely to be un- employed; not necessarily likely to bear the brunt of structural adjustment programs; more likely to have stunted (low height for age) children; less likely to report suffering an illness in the past month; less educated; and less likely to send their children to school.2 Such analysis has been used by the World Bank and the governments of the countries with LSMS surveys to quantify the dimensions, causes and consequences of poverty, and to design policies to reduce it. Information on poverty from LSMS surveys can be used to examine the distri- bution of benefits from price subsidies and from publicly provided services. The health, education, housing, and consumption modules include questions about expenditures on and use of subsidized services or commodities (schools, health clinics, electricity, public water supply, staple foods, kerosene, and more), and the community questionnaire provides information about the availability of services 2 These findings can be found in Glewwe (1990), Glewwe and Hall (1994) and Grootaert and Kanbur (1995). They are also documented in the various World Bank PovertyAssessments, which are summarized in World Bank (1996). This content downloaded from 151.28.174.136 on Sat, 04 May 2019 13:38:33 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 192 Journal of Economic Perspectives (health clinics, schools, post offices) and infrastructure (roads, electric supply, sew- erage networks, and so on). Accompanying background information about house- holds can then be used to show who benefits from price subsidies and publicly provided services (Grosh, 1994; Benjamin and Deaton, 1993). LSMS data have been used for policy analysis on topics that reflect the policy issues in each country. In Ecuador, for example, the data were used to help refine poverty maps, which are used to target government programs. In Jamaica, the data were used to reformulate the benefit levels and eligibility thresholds for the food stamp program. In Ghana, the data were used in considering whether to subsidize kerosene. In South Africa, the data helped in evaluating the potential of programs such as public works and old age pensions to alleviate poverty. In Bolivia, the LSMS data helped in evaluating the benefits to workers of employment in a labor-intensive public works scheme. In Jamaica, the data helped evaluate the targeting of the student loan program. Most of this work is not published, and sometimes not even formally written up in government documents, but it is influential nonetheless. LSMS surveys have also been used to support a great deal of academic work, including articles in professional journals, several books, and a large number of official government and World Bank working papers and reports. Much of this work has focused on topics that had proved difficult to handle with previously existing data. For example, how can one determine the price elasticity of demand for health care in developing countries, given that in such countries the public sector dominated service delivery and provided most services for free? The de- tailed LSMS data on travel time to health facilities and labor market information allowed calculating price elasticities based on travel time, which found that these elasticities can be fairly high, especially for the poor (Gertler and van der Gaag, 1990; Alderman and Lavy, 1996). This work has implications for the extent to which the poor should be required to pay for health care; location decisions for public health facilities; and the issue of whether to provide higher quality health care at a higher cost to users. Another question is whether child malnutrition leads to substantially lower school performance. The LSMS data have been used to investigate whether malnutrition delays enrollment in school and/or reduces school attainment (Glewwe and Jacoby, 1995). Yet another set of questions in- volves the labor supply behavior of rural households, which is difficult to measure because most rural workers are self-employed on family farms. The detailed LSMS data allow estimation of labor supply functions that incorporate productivity in self employment and time allocation in other activities, including leisure (Jacoby, 1993; Newman and Gertler, 1994). Table 2 lists some papers using LSMS data that have recently been published in leading economics journals. Note that this is something of a biased sample of all the work done using the data. It underrepresents the work done on the most recent surveys due to the lag between data availability and publication; it overrepresents analysis done by World Bank staff and consultants because the first countries to implement LSMS surveys initially restricted access to the data, denying it to academic researchers; and it underrepresents in-country and policy uses of the data because the table is based on This content downloaded from 151.28.174.136 on Sat, 04 May 2019 13:38:33 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms Margaret E.

The Future of LSMS Surveys When the first LSMS surveys were started in 1985 they were considered exper- imental. Their complexity led some survey statisticians to doubt whether they could be implemented successfully. Their feasibility has since been demonstrated. We expect that such surveys will be undertaken in a growing number of countries and that additional rounds will be done in countries that have already completed them. The trend toward increasing diversity in the surveys' objectives, questionnaires and sample design will continue. The World Bank's Development Research Group is currently undertaking a major evaluation of the design of LSMS surveys. Comprehensive guidelines for planning and implementing LSMS surveys are found in Grosh and Mufioz (1996). New and extremely detailed recommendations for questionnaire design should be ready in early 1998. The range of survey possibilities will be much broader, since survey designers will be able to choose different combinations of modules, and yet the resulting surveys will still incorporate the lessons from the experience of the This content downloaded from 151.28.174.136 on Sat, 04 May 2019 13:38:33 UTC All use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms 194 Journal of Economic Perspectives past 10 to 15 years. This new set of tools should allow a wide range of actors to develop their own LSMS surveys, by customizing the standard prototype to fit their needs and interests. One especially exciting technical innovation that will affect future LSMS activities is the use of global positioning system technology based on satellite signals. This tech- nology will make it easier to estimate distances between households and key services, such as schools and health facilities. It should also improve the accuracy of the sample by assisting interviewers in finding sampled households. Finally, use of global position- ing technology will make it easier to merge LSMS data with other geographically re- ferenced data, especially with soil, climate and topographical maps and with maps of government provided services such as schools, clinics, roads and the like. Obtaining LSMS Data When the first LSMS surveys were completed in the mid- to late 1980s, the data were often not accessible to economists outside the World Bank, since the data were the property of the national statistical agencies of the countries carrying out the surveys. However, many countries have now agreed to allow the World Bank's De- velopment Research Group to distribute the data to potential users around the world. Information is available at the LSMS web site (http://www.worldbank.org/ lsms/lsmshome.html), and is available by mail from LSMS Surveys, DECRG, World Bank, 1818 H Street NW, Washington, D.C. 20433. The e-mail address is (LSMS@worldbank.org). The fax number is 202-522-1153. Those interested should begin with the broad overview of data availability, found both on the website and in paper form as Grosh and Glewwe (1995). A second, more detailed, level of information is contained in the Basic Information documents for each country that summarize the questionnaire, sample design, or- ganization of field work, contents and structure of data sets and data access rules for each country's survey. The actual questionnaires are also available for review. Third, there are the actual data. Whether obtained from the web site or through the mail, data sets can usually be obtained as ASCII, SAS-portable, or STATA files. There is a small processing fee charged if these data are sent by mail. In some cases, it will be necessary to receive country permission before receiv- ing the data, which involves writing to the address for that country given at the LSMS website. When the researcher has obtained written permission to use the data from the country, it should be sent to the LSMS mailing address, and the data will then be made available. * We would like to thank Jere Behrman, Brad De Long, Carlo del Ninno, Greg Duncan, Chris Grootaert, Alan Krueger, Martin Ravallion and Timothy Taylorfor comments on earlier drafts.

Each questionnaire is composed of modules, sections that collect information on a specific topic. Questionnaires and their modules can be combined in a variety of different ways to create a multitopic household survey.There is no single right way to combine modules and question- naires into a survey; each way has advantages and disadvantages. The key is to choose a design that provides the best fit given the objectives of, and constraints on, the proposed survey. The starting point for designing the modules and The third step is to work out, question by ques- questionnaires to be used in a multitopic survey is a set tion, draft questionnaires for each module that will be of policy questions.The overall objective of each sur- included in the survey.

It also provided detailed recommendations on how to undertake the first two steps, which are deciding on the overall design of the survey and deciding which mod- ules to include in the survey questionnaire.This chapter discusses the last three steps of the five- step survey design process.The first section of this chapter describes the third step-drafting each module, question by question, to ensure that it will collect the data necessary to meet the mod- ule's objectives (which were laid out in the second step).The second section guides survey designers through the fourth step-coordinating the different modules and combining them to create a consistent and comprehensive set of questionnaires. The third section explains the proce- dures for the last step -translating the questionnaires into local languages and conducting a field test. The fourth section discusses the formatting of the questionnaires, which is an extremely important but often neglected aspect of designing successful multitopic surveys. Survey designers should refer to the material contained in the fourth section many times during the last three steps of the survey design process. In practice, the survey design process rarely moves the people involved in carrying out the fieldwork (the smoothly and sequentially from one step to the next. data producers) but also policymakers (who will make Instead, survey designers often find themselves moving decisions based on the data), members of the research backward and forward among the various steps. For community (who will analyze the data), and the staff example, if designers encounter difficulties when of any agencies financing or providing technical assis- drafting a specific module, they may need to reconsid- tance to the survey.

Given the endlessnumber of factors (cultural, economic, ethnic, linguistic, political, psy-chological, sociological, and religious) that influence the implementa-tion of any survey, managing such a project is as much art as science.Hence, the survey manager must have experience in survey implemen-tation and a clear understanding of the objectives of the study. 1As in all projects, the survey manager must plan, organize, lead, and controlthe development of the survey (Weeks 2003). Throughout the survey process technical and organizational deci- sions must blend the theoretically desirable with the practically feasi-ble (Moser and Kalton 1971). Within this realm the survey manager isresponsible for the following: Preparing the overall survey program; Designing the questionnaire and data entry form; Conducting the pilot; Selecting the survey rm 2and dening the nancial arrangements; Drawing the sample; Training the interviewers; and Monitoring the eldwork and developing data quality control procedures.Often there is thetemptation to skip on[survey] preparation inorder to to the rapidly. Thistemptation should beavoided. \u2014Ghislaine Delaine and others, \"The Social Dimensions of Adjustment Integrated Survey\"Chapter 2 Survey Management: An Overview 91We assume the survey manager to be a single individual. Although it is possible for a team of staff to take on this role, this is less desirable. Given the functional links amongthe key steps of any survey, there are obvious externalities that favor a single individualto be the survey manager. Furthermore, a clearly identied and experienced survey man-ager can ensure that the survey adequately covers policy issues of interest to the data users(Delaine and others 1991). 2The survey rm is contracted to do the eldwork and enter the data.The chronological sequence and overlap of each activity as well as their functional links must be carefully synchronized. After one step iscompleted, going back will compromise the next step and, thus, eitherthe timely conclusion of the survey, the accuracy of the results, or both.The survey manager is generally assisted in these tasks by a statisticianand a data processing coordinator, but the manager remains responsi-ble for overseeing the collection of accurate information in a timelymanner and within budget (Delaine and others 1991). A good surveymanager has the ability to anticipate possible sources of error (inter-viewing, wording of questions, editing, and coding) and delays (natio-nal or seasonal holidays, weather conditions, religious festivities, orsample frame inaccuracy) (Moser and Kalton 1971). Overall Program Design The early stages of a survey should include a careful review of the liter-ature and talks with experts in the country. This helps conceptualizepotential problems. Similarly, a review of previous survey work and dis-cussions with local survey practitioners will help determine what ap-proach works best, what hypotheses have been tested, and which questionitems are best suited for the specic survey (Warwick and Lininger 1975).This stage also includes an assessment of the survey infrastructure, a care-ful search for potential partners in implementing the eldwork and spon-soring the survey initiative, and nally the design of plans for datagathering and entry, reports, presentations, and dissemination. 3 Questionnaire Design, Pilot, and Data Entry Form After the research objectives have been identied, the difcult challenge of translating them into a well-conceptualized and methodologicallysound questionnaire begins (Warwick and Lininger 1975). In Invest-ment Climate Surveys 4the core5questionnaire represents the starting10 The Power of Survey Design 3It is good practice to address issues of data entry software and coding from the very be- ginning, although a more detailed discussion and implementation of these issues comesonly after the questionnaire is nalized. 4Productivity and Investment Climate Surveys, or Investment Climate Surveys, in short, are business surveys conducted by the World Bank. These surveys identify key features ofthe business climate that foster productivity in a way that allows regional and subregionalbenchmarking (World Bank 2003). 5The core questionnaire is a set of standard questions implemented across countries to enable international benchmarking. Retrieved on June 13, 2005, from http://www.ifc.org/ifcext/economics.nsf/Content/IC-SurveyMethodology.point. The development of the questionnaire starts soon after general plans have been drawn and ends just days before the start of the eld-work. Focus groups can identify concerns and experiences of the targetpopulation, as well as evaluate questions and clarify denitions (Gower1993). The initial questionnaire is usually revised many times. The pilot test in the eld is a critical component of questionnaire de- sign. Similarly, the training sessions for enumerators should be consid-ered the last step of questionnaire design, because it often helps identifyproblems with wording and translation. As soon as the questionnaire has been nalized, it must be immedi- ately coded and the data entry form developed. 6A variety of data entry software programs are available, some at no charge.7A well-designed data entry form will have two basic characteristics. First, it will havean interface that is a replica of the paper questionnaire. Second, it willinclude a number of built-in consistency checks to disallow invalid en-tries. The development of a data entry form is a delicate and complexprocess. A number of intricate cross-references and checks must be in-cluded, which requires a professional programmer. It remains the sur-vey manager's task to determine and identify which, and to whatextent, within- and cross-question consistencies should be embedded inthe form. 8The inclusion of too many or too stringent consistency checks will make data entry almost impossible, even when there are errors that can be easily corrected. Conversely, a lax system of consis-tency checks will defeat the purpose of the data entry form. A delicatebalance between these two alternatives must be found. Once completed the data entry form must be tested, if possible be- fore the beginning of the eldwork. Testing is of critical importanceand attempts to short cut this step could result in delays at later stagesof the survey. 9In the World Fertility Survey, more than 80 percent ofSurvey Management: An Overview 11 6Coding a questionnaire stands for assigning a name to each variable in the question- naire corresponding to each eld in the data set. 7A variety of commercially available software programs (Microsoft Access\u00a9, SPSS\u00a9, and so on) can be purchased, depending on the desired level of sophistication. Simpler butequally effective data entry programs can be downloaded for free from the U.S. Centersfor Disease Control and Prevention (www.cdc.gov/epiinfo/) or the U.S. Census Bureau(www.census.gov/ipc/www/imps/index.html). Additionally, the U.K. Association for Sur-vey Computing (ACS) has links to software that can be used for data capture and the dif-ferent stages of survey implementation (http://www.asc.org.uk/Register/index.htm). 8The complexity of the form automatically excludes the use of simple software such as Microsoft Excel\u00a9. Excel is data management software and, therefore, not appropriatefor this purpose. 9Form development and testing generally takes two to four weeks.all errors found at the rst check were due to specication errors and programming errors (Rattenbury 1980). Survey Firm Selection Depending on the intricacy of the questionnaire and the complexityof the sample elements, the selection of a survey firm is one of themost difficult and critical tasks. It affects both the timing of the sur- vey and the quality of the data collected. The survey infrastructure is usually difficult to assess in developing countries and an informed se-lection usually involves evaluating a wide range of factors, from thegeographic distribution of local offices to the number of personalcomputers owned (box 2.1). An experienced survey manager caneasily infer the technical ability of a prospective firm (Grosh andMu\u00f1oz 1996) from the quality of written documents, such as surveymanuals and recently implemented questionnaires, as well as fromthe complexity of surveys completed over the past two to three yearsand those planned in the near future. 1012 The Power of Survey Design Box 2.1 Criteria to Look at When Selecting a Survey Firm Experience QuestionnaireHow difcult is the content?How coherent is the content?How good is the formatting?How much time does the interview last?How are sensitive and memory questions addressed?

Source: Based on Grosh and Mu\u00f1oz 1996.Box 2.1 (continued)Another important factor to consider in the selection process is the organization of the eldwork. The collection of high-quality data in atimely manner depends on how well eld operations are organized. Co-ordinating and timing the interactions of tens if not hundreds of peopleat different levels and stages of the survey becomes a vital and yet com-plex task. The way the prospective implementing agency deals withstafng, scheduling, and coordinating simultaneous activities shouldtherefore be given the appropriate weight in the selection process(Weeks 2003). A survey in which each individual is clearly identied asa part of a team, in which all members are clear about their responsi-bilities and accountabilities, and in which a well-organized structure fa-cilitates the flow of information and quickly resolves possible conflictsand doubts will denitely have a positive impact on the timing andquality of the data collection process. Key actors in a typical InvestmentClimate Survey and their functional relationship are shown in box 2.2. As in all other steps, the procurement process requires a great deal of attention to details. Even when a highly recommended and seem-ingly well-qualied agency exists less noticeable factors should informthe selection process: How unexpected problems are anticipated and addressed; What steps are taken to ensure quality; Which approach is used to handle the expected bias associated with sensitive questions; What strategies are adopted to elicit participation; and Which characteristics interviewers and supervisors have (in terms of age, education, experience, and occupation). 11 The terms of reference (TOR) developed by the survey manager pro- vides guidance on the \"technical\" requirements of competing proposals.Inadequate TORs have frequently been a source of error in contractingout the eldwork (Grosh and Mu\u00f1oz 1996). Thus it is preferable to fol-low a two-stage strategy. Initially, the TOR should indicate the projectobjectives and provide a copy of the draft questionnaire as well as adescription of the basic minimum data quality requirements. Biddersshould be left free to formulate a detailed methodology to achieve thesurvey objectives. Given the cultural, political, religious, and ethniccharacteristics of each country, it is not advisable to apply the same14 The Power of Survey Design 11See chapter 5 for a more detailed treatment of the interviewer's characteristics.Survey Management: An Overview 15 Box 2.2 Key Actors and Their Functions in a Typical Investment Climate Survey The survey director generally is the head of the agency in charge of the eldwork. He or she provides professional leadership, coordinates with the survey manager on organizational and nancial issues,and provides support to survey implementation especially through community awareness. The survey manager coordinates with the survey director on more technical aspects of the survey work. He or she helps in designing the sample, plans and supervises the eld operation procedures,and contributes to the training session. He or she will also oversee the eld supervisors and the datamanager (Grosh and Mu\u00f1oz 1996). The supervisors assign respondents to interviewers, coordinate their assignments, and ensure that they work efciently. It is part of the supervisors' responsibilities to monitor and review the quality of theeldwork, to conduct unannounced eld interviews, and to make call-backs as deemed necessarywhile personally visiting some respondents. Supervisors must review the quality of completed ques-tionnaires, ensuring that interviewers' writing is legible and skip patterns are followed. Unreasonableanswers must be flagged and returned to the interviewer for correction, if necessary, through an addi-tional visit. Finally, supervisors facilitate the exchange of information between survey manager andinterviewers, make sure that all instructions from the central ofce are relayed to eld workers, and Survey director I1Survey manager Data manager Supervisor A personnel InterviewersBox Figure 2.2.1. Typical Organizational Structure of Fieldwork (continued )16 The Power of Survey Design ensure that the central ofce is regularly updated on the progress of data collection (Grosh and Mu\u00f1oz 1996). Interviewers set up appointments with the sampled respondents and conduct the interviews follow- ing the rules, techniques, and protocols highlighted during the training sessions and indicated in thesurvey materials. They re-interview respondents, when necessary, to rectify incorrect or incompleteentries. The data entry manager, along with the survey manager, designs the data entry quality control protocol and oversees the development of the data entry form.

Thus, for instance, in Indonesia it appears unnecessary to require call-backs given that standard practicecalls for each form to be signed and stamped by the respondent. Once asurvey rm has been selected, a second more detailed and comprehen-sive TOR should be agreed on among the parties. An often-overlooked criterion in the procurement process refers to the potential measurement error associated with each type of implementingagency. The type of agency conducting the eldwork\u2014 government agency or a private survey company \u2014can have a different effect on data accuracy depending on the kind of question asked. Sensitive questionsabout bribes, for instance, are consistently underreported when the in-terviewer is a government employee. 12Although the magnitude of the bias varies depending on the specic question, the impact of the under-reporting appears to be in the order of 0.3 to 0.6 standard deviationswhen a government agency is conducting the survey. 13Nonetheless the survey manager should not rush to the conclusion that private surveycompanies are always to be preferred. As a matter of fact, the same datashows that using government ofcers as interviewers has a positiveeffect on data accuracy by reducing measurement errors for nonsen- 12A more detailed description of this phenomenon is presented in chapter 3, on ques- tionnaire design, in the discussion on sensitive questions and subjective questions. 13See appendixes 2 and 3 for a description of questions and a complete set of regressions results.sitive questions. The manager's estimates of sales growth were more accurate14when government officials conducted the interview. This is not surprising, because statistical officers generally are better trainedand more experienced in conducting business interviews. The magni-tude of the underreporting (measured in terms of standard deviations)of corruption questions when government officials conduct the inter-views appears similar to the magnitude of accounting data inaccuracywhen the survey is fielded by a private firm (see figure 2.1). 15 Over the years, the nancial resources needed to conduct a rm-level survey in developing countries have varied. Once again a number ofcountry-specic factors apply, each having a different impact on thesurvey budget: a 7-page questionnaire will be priced differently than a20-page instrument, travel costs are unlikely to be the same in Braziland in Eritrea, and survey experts are harder to nd and more expen-sive in Africa than in East Asia.Survey Management: An Overview 17 14The absolute value of the error was more than 17 percent for a private company and close to 1.5 percent for a government agency. 15Data accuracy is measured as deviation between the manager's reported value of sales growth last year and the same values calculated from company books.Figure 2.1. Who Is Asking What? Reporting Differences When A Government Ofcial, Rather Than a Private Firm, Asks Sensitive Questions Source: Author 's calculations.0.3 -0.33-0.4-0.200.20.4Standard deviation Overreporting on sales questionUnderreporting on corruption questionPrivate Firm Government AgencyHousehold surveys experience shows that 70 to 90 percent of the total survey cost goes to eld implementation, while personnel and travel represent the two most important cost categories (table 2.1).Particular attention must also be paid to the internal composition ofthese two items. Determining the appropriate salary levels across differ-ent professional categories is always problematic. The survey job requiresmonths of intense work and it is unrealistic to assume that this can bedone without appropriate incentives, particularly for the interviewers.Travel costs, including per diems, will also be a source of resentment ifnot appropriately estimated. This is clearly a country-speci c problem. Nonetheless, accurate planning in terms of the estimated number ofvisits necessary to complete an interview is essential. Survey managers must use creativity, diplomatic skills, and expertise to nd a solution that is tailored to the country characteristics while being fair to all parties (Grosh and Mu \u00f1oz 1996). An issue that occa- sionally surfaces is not only the appropriate rate of pay, but also the rela-tive merits of paying interviewers on a piece rate or by the hour.Supporters of piece rate payment point out the strong economic incen-tive for eld staff and the more ef cient use of time. Hourly wage advo- cates criticize the former approach for providing an incentive to preferquantity over quality and to \"fabricate \" answers (Warwick and Lininger 1975). A combination of the two approaches might be the best solution.In this case, for each completed questionnaire, a flat rate would be paid, augmented by variable components, mainly related to travel costs andper diem expenses, with a decreasing weight when the number of visitsreaches a predetermined limit. It remains in the survey manger 's interest to relate the cost of the survey to the quality of the data collected, andthe nal rate agreed with the implementing agency should re flect this. The Sample Soon after the decision to undertake the survey has been reached, a number of critical decisions must be taken regarding the following: The identi cation of the sample unit; The localization of the population list; The design of the sampling procedure; and The determination of the sample size. Preparations to draw the sample should start at the earliest possible time given how dif cult and time-consuming it is in many developing18 The Power of Survey DesignSurvey Management: An Overview 19 Table 2.1 Share of Survey Cost in Household Surveys Percentage Weight of Accounting Categories Personnel Transport Equipment Consumables Other Sample Size Angola 63 22 10 1 4 6,000 Botswana 79 0a 10 4 7 7,000 Eritrea 64 0a28 5 3 4,000 Kenya 62 23 3 5 7 7,000Lesotho 75 5 6 2 12 7,500Madagascar 31 7 33 13 16 6,500Malawi 32 17 24 22 5 6,000Mozambique 61 12 3 12 11Somalia 44 18 5 1 33 2,200South Africa 69 24 2 4 2 30,000Swaziland 30 4 2 1 63 4,500Tanzania 78 13 2 1 7 3,000Zambia 82 5 2 6 5 8,000 Overall 63 15 7 6 9 7,054 Percentage Weight of Survey Activities Preparation Implementation Data Processing Reporting Angola \u2014 84 6 10 Botswana 10 59 22 9Kenya \u2014 94 3 4 Lesotho \u2014 73 19 9 Madagascar 0 79 3 18Malawi 5 63 16 16South Africa 1 93 3 3Swaziland 63 23 8 6Tanzania 23 72 4 1Zambia 0 92 6 1 Overall 7 81 6 6 Source: Keogh 2003.

At the end of the eld- work, the estimated weights must be adjusted to account for frame prob-lems and nonresponse. Training When everything is ready for the start of the eldwork, training should take place. No matter how complex the questionnaire is, and given theaverage interviewer 's quality in developing countries, training remains fundamental to ensure a consistent interpretation and implementationof questions. The survey manager, having extensive experience and aclear understanding of the analytical objective of each question, is thebest person to conduct the training. In this process, training manualsare particularly useful, containing detailed information on the generalpurpose of the survey, instructions on the conduct of the interviews, de-tailed explanations of the questions, and references to the methodologyfor recording answers. Fieldwork and Data Quality Control The eldwork is the most time-consuming part of the survey. Although the interview cycle itself must be clearly de ned and responsibilities clearly identi ed (box 2.3), the more complex the questionnaire, the more dif cult it is to estimate the exact timing of survey completion. A host of factors in fluence the chronological implementation of the survey. Apart from some obvious \"objective \" features such as the length of the questionnaire, the sizeand composition of the sample, and the number of interviewers, a host of other intangible factors, some quite subtle, come into play. For example, how well a questionnaire is de- signed will de nitely impact the timing of the interview. The appropri- ate use of skipping patterns and the clarity of de nitions and sentences will not only speed up the interview process but also ensure accuratedata. The quality of the interviewers, and more generally of the survey rm, is another factor in fluencing the timely completion of the survey. Interviewers with an unambiguous understanding of the questions, withexperience in similar surveys, and with the ability to establish a clearrelationship of trust with the respondents will foster higher coopera-tion and complete the interviews in a shorter period of time. Similarly,if the fieldwork is thoroughly organized, delays are minimized. Theaccuracy of the population list is yet another factor.

Typical Interview Cycledate, time will not be wasted in locating respondents that relocated or establishments that no longer operate. Last but not least the predeter-mined level of response rate considered acceptable will also impact the duration of the survey. A survey with 50 percent of item nonresponsewill no doubt be completed faster than a survey with 90 percent of allquestions appropriately answered. The beginning of the eldwork marks the start of a number of head- quarter (HQ) activities coordinated by the survey manager. As soon asinterviewers are in the eld, the survey manager should start planning for quality control and data cleaning. While the development of a response rate control program is relatively fast, the development of acleaning program takes longer. The response rate control must proceedalmost contemporaneously to the eldwork and should be used to feed back instructions to the eld manager about how to improve the qual- ity of the data collection process. To achieve this ef ciently, data must be sent back to HQ in batches at regular intervals. Data cleaning, onthe other hand, should start during the eldwork but can only be com- pleted after the end of the collection process. 16 One critical aspect of the survey manager 's job is to anticipate po- tential bottlenecks and take remedial actions before they compromisethe timely completion of the whole project. No matter how many fac-tors have been taken into account in the preparatory stage of the sur-vey, the experienced survey manager must be on the lookout for the22 The Power of Survey Design The central of ce should be responsible for the veri cation of the existence of establishments and for delivering the introductory letter. The interviewer should rst approach the respondent with a personal visit to secure participation. Additional coaching, if necessary, to convince reluctant respondents should be handled by the supervisor or survey director. The replacement of ineligible respondents must be carried outaccording to speci c sampling procedures agreed on with the survey manager. The supervisor 's role is to manage the eldwork and to check the quality of the interviews. The completed and veri ed questionnaire is transferred to the data entry manager whose team will code and enter it in electronic form.

Two useful tools are at the survey manager 's disposal \u2014 one for monitoring the design of the whole project, the other to super-vise the progress of the eldwork. A rst tool used in planning and managing the timing of a survey is the Gantt Chart (see gure 2.2). De ned as a graphic representation of the sequence and link of activities, it can be used to detect slacks and thecritical path of the whole project. 17This chart is a useful tool in identi- fying what options are available if problems occur during the implemen-tation of the survey. For example, if the survey is behind schedule, thefollowing alternatives could be employed to make up time (Weeks2003): Start earlier critical path activities by overlapping with predecessor activities. Shorten the duration of critical path activities by (1) adding re- sources if they are resource-driven, or (2) internalizing the loss(that is, lower quality) if not resource driven. This approach worksbest if employed on earlier activities. Move resources from noncritical to critical path activities. The second tool designed to aid field supervision is the weekly re- port (table 2.2). This simple form allows the survey manager toeffectively monitor the progress of interviews from invitation to com-pletion and to estimate a number of fieldwork performance indica-tors, such as cooperation rate, response rate, coverage rate, refusalrate, and completion rate.Survey Management: An Overview 23 17The critical path is the series of activities that determines the duration of the project. Slack is the amount of time that an activity can be delayed without delaying the project comple-tion date. By de nition, the critical path has zero slack (Project Management Institute 2000).Figure 2.2.

Among those uses are poverty measurement, informing food security assessment, providing inputs in the compilation of food balance sheets, providing information for the planning and monitoring of nutrition interventions, informing the compilation of national accounts, and colle cting data for compilation of CPI. As a result of the different uses, and the constituencies of users associated with them, the demands from the data vary, and depending on the exact nature of HCES being designed, there are going to be different sets of co nstraints and opportunities for repurposing. Any attempt at adjusting the design of a survey needs to take into account the analytical needs of the different users. In this document, the main uses considered in setting the criteria for guiding survey desig n are food security assessments, poverty measurement, and nutrition policy and programming. Some key issues in the measurement of poverty and food security, and for monitoring nutrition interventions, that are useful for understanding the data needs conne cted to those uses are presented in the Annex 1 .9 In what follows, the document contains a summary of the literature on key choices that confront practitioners as they design and implement HCES questionnaires. Those aspects were identified as priority area s in a review conducted by Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat (2014) and by experts that participated in the consultation process convened by IAEG -AG and led by FAO and the World Bank. Several of those issues are also treated, theoretically and empirically, in a recent issue of the journal Food Policy . The volume includes case studies from a diverse set of developing and OECD countries, ana lyzing how different surveys design options affect the quality of the data being collected and, in turn, the implications for statistical inference and policy analysis (Zezza et al. , 2017). 2.1. Recall versus diary and length of reference period Data on household food consumption (and acquisition) is commonly collected either by asking households to keep a diary over a reference period (e.g. days or weeks) or through interviews in which respondents are asked to recall consumption for a specific period (e.g. the past week or the past 30 days). A large body of evidence from research and practical experience shows that the method chosen can significantly affect the resulting estimates of consumption. 9 See Annex 1 13 The recall period is referred to as the period over which respondents are asked to recall the consumption of food items. The recall period differs from the reference period when household s are interviewed multiple times during multiple visits to the household (Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat, 2014). For example, if households are interviewed about their food consumption in the last seven days over four weekly visits, the recall period is seven days and the reference period is 28 days. In diary methods, households are generally asked to record consumption at the moment in which it takes place (e.g. at meal times or at time of purchase). However, in practice, households often fill in information about their consumption at the end of the day, or during supervised visits from enumerators (for example, for two -day recall periods if visited every other day). This blurs the line between diary and recall methods, especially when respondent illiteracy i s high and supervisors support completion of the diary with visits every few days. The choice of recall period has long been a critical element of survey design for which there has been limited agreement and evidence of best practice. Scott and Amenuvegbe (1990) suggested the \"wide variations [in recall period] reflect the almost total absence of evidence for developing countries on the level of recall error and its relation to recall duration.\" Similarly, Deaton , and Grosh (2000) commented that \"there are no definitive answers about the optimal recall period (...). In the meantime, however, surveys must be designed .\" This uncertainty is reflected in the large variation observed in the choice of recall periods across surveys. The review of 100 HCES undertaken by Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat (2014) reveals that of the 56 surveys using exclusively interview methods, 26 sur veys were using multiple recall periods depending on the source of acquisition or the nature of the purchase (frequently or less frequently purchased). Of the 30 surveys using only one recall period, 13 used a recall period of seven days, four used a recal l period of 14 to 15 days, two used a recall period of one month, five used the \"usual month\" or \"usual week\" approach, and the rest used a different recall period . The \"usual month\" or \"usual week\" approach uses a recall period longer than the month (usu ally the past 12 months) and is aimed at capturing seasonality and other short -term fluctuations in food consumption. Households are asked to recall their average monthly or weekly consumption over the past year, sometimes by breaking this into questions a bout the number of months per year that they consume (or acquire) the food in question, the times per month that they acquire it in those months and the typical quantity and value on each acquisition occasion. Consequently, the recall period is the year an d the reference period is meant to be the typical month within that year, although there is evidence that respondents anchor their answers in the economic conditions of the most recent month (Gibson, 2007). For recall surveys, the challenge is to choose a n effective method for measuring the concept of interest while avoiding biases resulting from two main sources: memory decay and telescoping. A longer recall period may be desirable to better capture items consumed infrequently and to obtain a better sense of the true distribution of consumption over a longer time period (addressing the seasonality of consumption). However, one common effect of longer recall periods is 14 memory decay (or \"progressive forgetting\" on the part of the respondent), to use the term inology of Deaton and Grosh (2000), which can lead to under -reporting of consumption. Scott and Amenuvegbe (1991) investigated the magnitude of recall error in Living Standards Measurement Study style surveys in experiments with the Ghanaian Living Standar ds Survey. For 13 frequently purchased items, expenditure reported in the survey fell an average of 2.9 percent per additional day of recall. For seven -day recall, expenditure was 87 percent of what it was for single -day recall; after two weeks, the recall error levelled out at around 20 percent. Similarly, the Indian National Sample Survey conducted experiments on recall period using \"last week\" and \"last month\" in which it was found food expenditure estimates in the weekly recall was more than 20 percent higher than in the monthly recall ( NSSO, 2003). Although a shorter recall period reduces error caused by memory decay, choosing a short recall period introduces another set of problems. As noted by Deaton and Grosh (2000), even under perfect recall, when the recall period is shorter than the period used for analysis, the measure includes variance that does not reflect the true distribution of living standards. A short recall period of one day may eliminate bias in the mean,10 but it poorly reflects the dist ribution of expenditure and consumption over a longer time period , such as a month or a year, which generally is the key statistic of interest for household surveys. While the \"usual month\" approach was advocated by Deaton and Grosh as a way to structure a long recall period to make it more feasible for respondents to answer, while providing analysts with a measure of more typical living standards than is available from a short recall period, the evidence is that this method is not able to overcome the tens ion between what is feasible to ask and what is desirable to know. In particular, the \"usual month\" method has proven to be cognitively burdensome, and it, therefore, introduces educational -related inequality into the measure of consumption inequality, tak es almost twice as long to field as a fixed recall survey over the same foods, and introduces errors on both the extensive and intensive margins (Friedman et al, 2017). Another strategy used in some surveys is to break the longer reference period into a series of short, adjacent, recall periods. For example, in the Ghana Living Standards Measurement Study , households are visited up to 10 times over a one - month period, so that there are only short recall periods between each visit. A similar design is present in many diary -keeping surveys for illiterate respondents, who may be visited every day or second day over the 14 to 28 -day reference period. While there may be some novelty for a respondent being interviewed the first time, a high frequency of repetitious interview visits is likely to induce non - compliance, and clear evidence of that is shown in the Ghan a Living Standards Measurement Study by Sch \u00fcndeln (2017), who finds that data quality is highest for the first interview and falls monotonically with each successive interview. Thus, measured food poverty would be 13 percentage points higher if all 10 interviews of the same household are used, compared with using just the data from the first visit. 10 Assuming the sample of household is sufficiently distributed throughout seasons. 15 The trade -off between shorter reference periods that allow recall over that same period to be less prone to forgetting, but provide a poor guide to typical, long -run living standards also affects studies focused on estimating average daily per capita dietary energy consumption (DEC).11 In particular, shorter reference periods are found to affect the variability in energy and nutritional estimates. Using data for My anmar collected over two monthly rounds per household approximately six months apart, Gibson (2016) annualizes estimates of daily calories per capita from each survey round in two ways: a na\u00efve extrapolation that multiplies estimates from each round by six and then adds them, and a corrected extrapolation, which is based on the intra -year correlation in daily calorie per capita across survey rounds of 0.45. The implications for measures of hunger by doing this correction is exemplified in Figure 3. Given two distributions with the same median calories per capita per day, the one based on na\u00efve extrapolation of the monthly data will have a greater dispers ion compared to the adjusted one, resulting in a greater incidence of hunger for a given threshold (2000 kcal/day in this case) .12 Figure 3 Chronic hunger overstated by na\u00efve extrapolation from monthly calories to annual Source : Gibson (2016). An analysis performed by the FAO Statistics Division using the 2010 data of the Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey illustrates how the variance of the per capita DEC is significantly reduced over longer observation periods. (Box 1). 11 This is a key variable in the measurement of undernourishment, as estimated by FAO and reported in the State of Food Insecurity in the World Report series. 12 To estimate the prevalence of undernourishment (Sustainable Development Goals indicator 2.1.1), FAO is using the minimum dietary energy requirement that depends on the age, sex structure of the populat ion, the fifth percentile of the body mass index distribution for adults, the height of the individuals in the population and the average of the sedentary lifestyle range for physical activity levels in the country. This threshold is not fixed and varies f rom one country to the other. 16 Box 2 Case study: Bangladesh 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey The Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2010 was carried out from February 2010 to January 2011. Within those 12 months of investigation, the survey was divided into 18 periods, each 20 days. Food consumption was collected through a diary over a period of 14 days. Throughout the period, households we re visited frequently (from 7 to 14 visits). The Dietary Energy Consumption (DEC) was estimated for each day of the diary. The figure below shows the coefficient of variation (CV) of DEC obtained using different numbers of diary days. From the plot, it ca n be clearly seen that the variability is highest (CV=35 percent) when using observations from the first day only and decreases convexly and converges at a value of CV of around 24 percent after the seventh day. After the first week, the variability does n ot seem to decrease much, suggesting that a reference period of seven days might be enough for estimating the variability of DEC. Source: Gr\u00fcnberger (2017a) Short recall periods can also lead to telescoping in which respondents report consumption that has taken place outside the reference period, also causing a bias in estimates. Several studies suggest that there cannot be one optimal recall length, as, depending on the type of good and the frequency of consumption , telescoping or decay may be observed (Bradburn 2010 ; Hurd and Rohwedder, 2009). In general, telescoping is more likely for large and infrequently purchased or consumed items under shorter recall periods, while a longer recall period leads to recall decay and underreporting of more common and frequent purchases (Deaton and Grosh, 2000; Moltedo et al, 2014; Neter and Waksberg, 1964). The Indian National Statistical Office designed an experimental survey including three types of data collections: daily visits with direct measurement (benchmark), seven -day recall, and 30 -day recall by food group. The report of the Indian National Statistical Office ( NSSO, 2003) shows that optimal recall period depends on the food group and frequency of consumption. The 30 -day recall works better than the seven -day recall in measuring staple food like cereals and is not inferior in measuring high -frequency items. One explanation for those 17 patterns is that staple foods, and other high -frequency items, lend themselves to more accurate \"rule of thumb\" reporting, based on their regularity (Friedman et al, 2017), so strictly speaking they are being \"estimated\" rather than \"recalled\", and with a 30 -day period, the effect of any telescoping is diluted compared with a seven -day period. A possible solution for dealing with te lescoping is a bounded recall approach, suggested by Neter and Waksberg (1964). In that approach, a first visit to the household by the enumerator is used to establish the bound of the recall period for a second visit, which is when the actual interview ta kes place. The enumerator can, accordingly, ask the respondent about consumption since the first interview, reducing the likelihood of respondents reporting consumption or acquisitions taking place outside the recall period. This approach can, however, be costly to administer as it requires two visits to the same household, and despite having a long history (including within the Living Standards Measurement Study program), there have not been enough studies to provide convincing evidence that it offers a si gnificant advantage in terms of data quality (Deaton and Grosh, 2000; Gibson, 2005). This is, therefore, an area in which future methodological research could usefully focus on to establish whether such advantage exists in practice. Diaries present an app roach which in theory can deal with important shortfalls of regular (longer) recall methods, such as telescoping and recall bias. They are in fact the method of choice and are successfully implemented in many countries for collecting data on food and other frequent expenditures. However, they can be practically challenging to implement in the conditions prevalent in many low - and middle -income countries. Diaries are far more demanding in terms of supervision, especially with illiterate respondents, when the y are implemented as a series of short recall interviews, and as a result, become more expensive and demand higher capacity. While a well -implemented diary is generally considered the gold standard for measuring consumption, poorly implemented ones are oft en inferior to a good recall survey. Even in the context of the United States of America, where the set of challenges for diaries and recall may be different than in lower income countries, evidence suggests that recall surveys might outperform diaries (Be e, Meyer and Sullivan, 2012). A growing body of research has shown how the diary method causes considerable response burden and fatigue, particularly when the length of the diary increases, ultimately affecting data quality and reliability. Studying the Canadian Food Expenditure Survey, Ahmed, Brzozowski , and Crossley, (2006) find a decrease in reporting because of \"diary exhaustion\" with reporting decreasing by 10 percent from the first to the second week of filling diaries. Similarly, studying the United States, Stephens (2003) finds significantly higher values in the first diary week and on the first day of each diary week relative to the remaining days, attributable to respondent fatigue. Analyzing the 2009/10 data of Papua New Guinea, Gibson (2013) also finds that the total value of consumption transactions declined by 4.4 percent per day during the diary - keeping period. A large set of other studies, such as Kemsley (1961), Turner (1961), Sudman and Ferber (1971), McWhinney and Champion (1974), and 18 Silberstein and Scott (1991) , find similar evidence of fatigue and de cay in information collection in diaries over time. With high levels of supervision and careful implementation, diaries can and are being implemented in some countries, with good results. In analyzing the Bangladesh 2010 Household Income and Expenditure S urvey, the FAO Statistics Division reported a negligibly low decrease of DEC because of fatigue, likely because of very good respondent supervision practices, with enumerator visits taking place every one or two days.13 Such levels of supervision lead to a mix of diary and interview methods that are not likely to be affordable; diaries do not, therefore, appear to be the most suitable method for resource -constrained statistical offices in low - and middle -income countries. Furthermore, even for well-implement ed diaries, the evidence clearly suggests that longer periods of implementation do not add to the quality of information (they actually detract from it) and entail higher implementation costs. Expanding mobile phone coverage throughout the world opens poss ibilities for remotely assisting diary completion (as well as recall interviews) at a fraction of the cost. This is an emerging trend (or an established one in some high -income countries), but not an area for which there is enough experience at scale in lo w-income settings for it to be recommended as a common practice during the time these guidelines are being formulated. One final aspect of diary implementation is that often the analyst is presented with data that have already been to some extent aggregat ed (e.g. by adding up the 7 or 14 days of data), which does not allow for detecting and correcting possible patterns in the data, such as diary fatigue (Troubat and Gr\u00fcnberger, 2017). When diaries are implemented, it is important that they are reported tog ether with full metadata, allowing the user to evaluate the data -collection process, including the role of the enumerator in aiding the data -collection process, the number and timing of supervision visits, and similar details. In the Living Standards Measu rement Study handbook, Deaton and Grosh (2000) provided a discussion of the issues outlined above and concluded by recommending only changes on the margins of the Living Standards Measurement Study status quo. Specifically, that meant using bounded recall for purchases, coupled with a usual month question for purchases and consumption of food from own production, plus one 12 -month recall question on the value of food gifts received by the household. Deaton and Grosh has already observed, however, a decline in the actual use of bounded recall in the Living Standards Measurement Study survey practice for reasons related to the added cost and burden (for enumerators and respondents) of the additional household visit. While pointing to the pros and cons of the u sual month and of shorter recall periods (progressive forgetting, telescoping, difference from the \"true\" variance) as discussed above, in recommending the usual month approach, they also recognized that this was based on weak and often contradicting evide nce, and mostly motivated by the desire to modify the \"status quo\" at the margins, in the absence of stronger evidence in favour of a particular approach. 13 Food consumption reporting dropped on average by less than 0.1 percent per diary day. 19 Despite the lack of conclusive evidence lamented by Deaton and Grosh, and their call for \"every survey [to] have a budget for experimentation\", there has been a limited number of new studies undertaken in low - and middle -income countries focusing on those methodological questions. One that has been particularly influential is the SHWALITA study (\"Survey of Household Welfare and Labour in Tanzania\") (Beegle et al., 2012; Gibson et al., 2015; de Weerdt et al., 2016). New evidence has also been produced throug h the work reported by Backiny - Yetna, Steele , and Yacoubou (2017) in Niger. Based on those studies and increased practical experience, practitioners involved in living conditions surveys have come to favour a seven -day recall period over longer reference p eriods. Deaton and Grosh had already noted signs of the bounded approach falling out of fashion with practitioners because of its higher complexity. The SHWALITA study (Beegle et al. , 2012) provides convincing evidence, from an experimental setting, that recall interviews inquiring about \"usual\" monthly consumption food underestimated household consumption expenditure when compared to the benchmark assisted individual diary (see Figure 1 ), whereas the seven -day recall was reasonably close to the benchmark. At the same time, the usual month interviews also had the longest completion times (76 minutes compared to just under 50 minutes for the 7 - and 14 -day recall), and were not associated with a significantly smaller coefficient of variation when compared to the shorter recall methods. In addition to the resource implications of longer fieldwork time, the longer completion time for the usual month approach is suggestive of a greater burden on the respondent who, with the enumerator, needs to engage in a demand ing estimation procedure to work out the response for a typical month starting from recalling consumption episodes over a 12 -month period. Taken together, this evidence indicates that the usual month may be a lose-lose proposition if it is less accurate an d more cumbersome to implement when compared to a seven -day recall. This is possibly the most important single development in the evidence base since the publication of Deaton and Grosh (2000). Importantly, another plea made by Grosh and Deaton (2000) two decades ago remains unanswered and just as valid today. As changing the recall period or method leads to incomparability issues with previous surveys using other methods, changes in survey methods over time should be accompanied by an experimental stud y to make it possible to reconcile the figures produced by the survey before and after the change in methods. Experiments, such as Beegle et al. (2012) and Backiny -Yetna, Steele , and Yacoubou (201 7) have provided good practical examples of how changes in m ethods can be assessed and thus allow for valid comparisons when methods are changed. 2.2. Seasonality, number of visits Consumption and expenditure patterns often show seasonal variations that are linked to the agricultural production season, cyclical events, such as floods and droughts, or cultural events (e.g. Ramadan, Christmas), which affect food availability, prices an d customary consumption practices. The existence of 20 seasonality in food consumption patterns is well -established (Paxson 1992 , 1993; Alderman, 1996) but its extent depends greatly on the context. Seasonality can be particularly important for food consumpt ion because seasonal variations in dietary patterns, overall quantities of food consumed, and the consumption of particular nutrients can be pronounced, partly because of its relationship with food production cycles (Coates et al. , 2012). D'Souza and Jolliffe (2012) find that household consumption in Afghanistan can be as much as one third lower in the lean season compared with the post -harvest season. The different levels of consumption, if taken at face value, would result in estimates of the poverty head count doubling from 23 percent in the fall to 46 in the following summer (D'Souza and Jolliffe, 2012). Seasonality in food prices is a key concern as it is found to be significant and can affect estimates of poverty and consumption (Gilbert, Christiaensen , and Kaminski, 2016). That is of course a major issue for surveys collecting data for the calculation of CPI. Seasonal variations can also originate from increased expenditure during festivals and holidays. In the United States, it has been established tha t consumption is higher during holidays and summer months (Barsky and Miron, 1988). In low - and middle -income countries, expenditure can vary significantly with holidays, festivals, and religious observances. Jolliffe and Serajuddin (2015), using data for Jordan, note that during the period of Ramadan, consumption levels are 11 percent greater than during other periods of the year. The festive expenditures can be difficult to capture in surveys because it is often difficult for survey fieldwork to operate a s normal during festive periods. A few surveys, such as the Living Standards Surveys in Viet Nam, use a special recall module for food consumption during festive periods, with analys is typically then spread over the consumption estimates for the households observed in the rest of the year. Within -year temporal variation can originate from other patterns, such as those associated with payment schedules for wages or social assistance (Stephens, 2003). Troubat and Gr\u00fcnberger (2017), in studying the urban subs ample of the Household Socio -Economic Survey 2007 -2008 of Mongolia , have found cyclical variations in food acquisition levels not only between months but also within months and weeks. Because of Independence Day, a major national holiday occurring in Decem ber (see Figure 4, left panel), results in the mean consumption in that month are substantially higher than for the other months of the year. A systema tic pattern is also apparent for data collected at the end of each month when food consumption is significantly higher (centre panel). Households also tend to spend significantly more on food on Tuesday and Fridays as compared with Mondays and Wednesdays ( right panel). 21 Figure 4 Variation in mean food consumption by month, day of the month, and day of the week, urban Mongolia Source : Troubat and Gr\u00fcnberger (2017 ). Even if such patterns are difficult to generalize given the context specificity, they remain an important example of sources of bias that should be mitigated to the extent possible in survey design (Fielder and Mwangi, 2016). If seasonality is not taken in to account when there is marked seasonal variability in food consumption, the use of short reference periods bias the estimates of the mean and the standard deviation of the distribution of habitual food consumption in the population. Recorded mean consump tion may be higher or lower, depending on the season when the data are collected, and estimates of the coefficient of variation may be biased by the confounding effect of seasonal variation. A survey carried out at a specific time of the year (say a seaso n, month, or week), misses seasonal variation in consumption and risk being unrepresentative of typical consumption across the year, even when it manages to accurately capture consumption over the period of data collection. Also, surveys that are not adequ ately capturing the entire year pose problems for international comparability. Comparisons of consumption data for a country conducting a survey in the lean season and one conducting it in the harvest season are difficult to make in the absence of elements that enable the habitual consumption levels in both countries to be gauged. Even over time, comparisons of surveys undertaken within the same country and during the same period of the year might be invalidated if major events correlated with consumption patterns move in and out of the survey implementation period. This may happen with Ramad an, the dates for it move from year to year, or when harvest periods are delayed or pushed forward by weather events. For all those reasons, it has been recommended that 22 HCES should cover a full year to properly capture seasonal variations in expenditures (ILO, 2003), although this is by no means a universal practice. Deaton and Grosh (2000) suggest the use of a \"usual month\" approach to overcome seasonal variation, but in the previous section, it was shown how the reliability of that approach appears questionable, and is associated with longer interview times and heavi er cognitive burden on the respondents. Deaton and Zaidi (2002) suggest that for capturing household consumption, the optimal survey implementation and design is the one likely to provide the most precise estimate of annual consumption for each household, not just for households on average. Based on this objective, the ideal design is one in which households are visited each \"season\" and habitual consumption is then derived as an average over the year of seasonal consumption. For variance -based measures, th ose intra - year revisits make possible corrected extrapolation, along the lines of what is shown for estimates of hunger in Gibson (2016). A drawback of revisiting the same households is the cost and the trade -off with overall sample size, as for any given sample size, the survey costs increase with the number of multiple visits. Just over half (53 percent) of the surveys review ed by Smith , Dupriez , and Troubat (2014) considered seasonality by using one of two approaches. The first approach (used in 41 perc ent of assessment surveys) is to distribute data collection throughout a year by surveying subsets (usually one twelfth of the households in the sample) in each month of the year, with subsamples representative nationally for each quarter. This approach (w hich conforms to the ILO recommendation) requires careful planning of the sampling strategy and survey implementation, but it can ensure that the seasonal variation across space and time is captured, at least for a \"synthetic\" household albeit not for any particular household in the sample, and represents a lower burden on households as they are visited only in one period of the year. This method can present advantages in terms of organization when survey staff are employed to just work on one survey, as it smooths the need for the workforce over the survey year and can allow working with smaller teams, hence ensuring tighter supervisions. The second approach (used in 12 percent of the surveys reviewed) is to conduct two to four visits during the year on the same households. It was noted above how additional visits to the same households come at a cost, pose logistical challenges , and increase the burden on the respondents. This option can, however, be attractive when the survey also has other objectives, suc h as collecting data on agricultural activities, to the extent that the visits can be timed around salient moments for both objectives; for example different points in the agricultural season (e.g. post -planting and post -harvest) as is done in the Nigeria National Panel Survey (2010 -2011, 2012 -2013 , 2014 -15) and in Enqu\u00eate Nationale sur les Conditions de vie des M\u00e9nages et l'Agriculture (2011, 2014) conducted for Niger. Finally, three of the surveys reviewed by Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat (2014) collected d ata in four visits over a 12 -month period. This approach is widely deemed to be very difficult to implement and excessively cumbersome in terms of organization, with the burden on respondents at its highest. Some countries implement two rounds of data coll ection in different periods of the year, but on a different cross -section of households. That does away with the added interview burden for the household, but it only allows 23 controlling for seasonality for the sample aggregate and not for each specific household. Also, it does not provide an opportunity for correcting variance -based measures for excess variability due to intra -year fluctuations. Forty -seven percent of the surveys reviewed by Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat (2014) do not satisfactorily account for seasonality in their design, as they are implemented through one household visit over the span of a few months. This approach returns data that are subject to all the biases discussed at the beginning of this section, but it is quite common because the approach is easy to implement. When staff are employed by different surveys implemented by the same statistical office, the approach allows the office to move them on to the next project when the household income and expenditure survey fieldwork is comple ted. It is often also motivated by the idea that if the period of implementation does not vary, then at least over time, comparison would be safeguarded. This is, however, a questionable assumption , as the extent and timing of seasonal variations may not b e the same from one year to the next. Also, any unforeseen implementation issues that would delay the onset of the fieldwork from its planned schedule would invalidate over time comparability of the data. These are very serious concerns that point to the n eed to abandon this practice for one that takes seasonality fully into account. A hybrid approach that could be experimented, which at least partly limits the more serious shortcomings of the \"one visit over a few months\" approach, would entail complementi ng that one visit with a second visit on a subsample of households. This additional subset visit could provide the information required to correctly annualize the data from the first visit. This is, however, only a hypothetical survey design that would nee d to be carefully tested before being applied at scale, and as such, it represents at best an indication for further research.14 2.3. Acquisition versus consumption15 Early on, food consumption data were mainly collected in HCES (in particular , in household budget surveys) to construct the consumer price indices or to inform national accounts. For such uses, the interest was mainly in collecting data on food items acquired through expenditures . Obtaining food through expenditures is now widespread throughout the world and has become the prominent form of food acquisition in many locations, especially i n urban areas. However, in many countries , a considerable share of households obtain s some food from their own production, such as from crop cultivation, livestock rearing, fishing and aquaculture, or hunting and gathering . It is also quite common for households to obtain some of their food in kind, in the form of 14 An example of this design, using a 20 percent subsample who were revisited approximately five months after the initial visit, is provid ed by Gibson (2001). The second visit was estimated to add about 10 percent to total survey costs, and made it possible to partition poverty estimates into chronic and transient components. 15 This section is based on and reproduces parts of Conforti, Gr\u00fcnberger, and Troubat (2017). 24 gifts from other households, payments from an employer, or public or private assistance (school feeding, food assistance programs , or social or private transfers in kind). As HCES are increasingly used for poverty and food security analysis, the emphasis of the surveys has shifted to also collecting data on food items obtained through not only expenditures , but also through other sources of acquisition. Accessibility is one of the dimensions of food and nutrition security, as defined by FAO, which includes access to food from all possible sources. For poverty analysis, all sourc es of food acquisition enter the consumption aggregate, not only those that imply an outlay of cash. With regard to nutritional assessments, what is actually ingested matters. Again, that implies a focus on consumption (or more specifically, intake) of foo d regardless of how it was acquired. Understanding how food systems work and evolve, what share of foods households in different socio -economic groups acquire from different channels, what the relative prices are for households in different locations, and what the nutrition and welfare implications are, requires having access to food data. For national accounts, food produced for own consumption is part of the household final consumption expenditure. Getting information on own -account production and consump tion of food (as well as other goods) by households is , therefore , critical, even though agriculture surveys or censuses may also provide that information. Such food should be valued at \"basic prices\" of similar goods, which can be approximated by the price of similar goods sold on a local market, or the price declared b y the household producer if he or she had sold the food rather than consumed it. Information on food and meals acquired through in -kind transfers is also important. Valuation should be based on actual cost if actually purchased by the provider or productio n cost, both being unknown and difficult to evaluate by the beneficiary. Not all surveys, however, are designed to capture information on all the food that is consumed or available for consumption in a household from all the sources of acquisition. Three d ifferent approaches to collecting food data can be identified, following Conforti, Gr\u00fcnberger , and Troubat (2017) : Acquisition . Households report on food they acquired through purchases, own production and in -kind transfers. Actual consumption of the same food is not reported. Combination of acquisition and consumption . Households report on acquisition for food they incurred an expenditure for purchases, without specifying the amount of food consumed. Food con sumption derived from own production or received from transfers is reported. Consumption . Households report on food consumed, and on whether that same food was purchased, own -produced or received as a transfer. Differences in food measurement among surve ys focused on acquisition and consumption are not always clear. In principle, the difference between the two measures is essentially a change in stocks, and food wasted in households. For surveys based on efficient representative samples homogeneously spre ad across 25 time and space, changes in stocks should on average be close to zero. In any given reference period, some households may build stocks while others may consume food from stocks. However, surveys with less effective timing of household visits may s how significant differences between acquisition and consumption (e.g. if the survey is implemented in one visit when most households are stocking or destocking). Smith Alderman & Aduayom (2006) provide a general discussion about the difference between est imates of consumption and acquisition. Depending on the length of survey coverage and reference period, the distribution of acquired food is expected to have a higher variance and a higher mean than the distribution of consumption. The variance of acquisit ion surveys is higher because daily food consumption is smoother than acquisition. This difference is expected to decrease to zero as the length of the survey period increases. During the reference period, households can either consume from stocks (underes timating household consumption using an acquisition survey) or build stocks (overestimating household consumption using an acquisition survey). As a consequence, households can have zero expenditure during a given reference period, albeit consuming from st ocks (Gibson and Kim, 2012). Acquisition surveys should be used to approximate aggregated consumption of population groups, rather than habitual consumption of individual households. Acquisition data are assumed to have a higher mean than consumption becau se food waste, rotten stocks, or food given to pets is already detracted in consumption estimates (Smith Alderman and Aduayom, 20 06). However, empirical studies suggest that the difference between averages of food acquisition and consumption is not always positive, but they can sometimes be close to zero or even negative (Kaara and Ramasawmy, 81 HCES16 conducted between 1988 and 2014 and found that the average dietary energy consumption from surveys focusing on acquisitions was only slightly higher than that from surveys focusing on consumption, but the variability was, in turn, much higher (an average coefficient of variation of 76 compared to 52). Though the difference in the aggregate measure is not that significant, the difference in the coefficient of variation is of real concern for FAO, which is using the coefficient of variation derived from food data collected in HCES to estimate the prevalen ce of undernourishment. FAO has developed a methodology to overcome the issue of excess variability encountered in the food consumption measurement (Wanner et al., 2014). Troubat and Gr\u00fcnberger (2017) applied this methodology to the Household Socio -Economi c Survey 2007 /2008 of Mongolia, which collected food consumption and food acquisition.17 They found that the difference in variability that exists between DEC from acquisition and DEC from consumption disappears after both distributions are corrected for e xcess variability (coeffi cient of variation decreased from 63 to 31 percent for food 16 Surveys analysed by the FAO food security and nutrition statistics team from 2006 to 2014, using the ADePT -FSM software developed jointly by FAO and the World Bank (Moltedo et al., 2014). 17 The latter survey measures a h ousehold's food acquisition, and food stocks at the beginning and the end of the reference period. Combining the information of acquisition and stock variation, the household's food consumption can also be derived from food acquisition. 26 consumption measurement based on acquisition -type data and from 52 to 30 percent for food consumption measurement based on consumption -type data). The decision to collect acquisition or consumption data is not expected to have a large impact on the estimate of the prevalence of undernourishment, nor poverty, as there is no significant effect on the mean and the impact on variability can be reduced using the control for exc ess variability. However, for countries with a large population and low average DEC, a small difference in kilocalories per capita per day can still affect food security and nutrition assessments. In addition to those general questions, there is a more spe cific - but not less important - set of risks associated with survey design that does not explicitly take into account the difference between consumption and acquisition. According to the review performed by Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat . (2014), in surveys based on recall interviews, it is not uncommon for questionnaires to include poorly worded leading questions or other forms of design ambiguity that can lead to incomplete enumeration of foods consumed. Such issues arise when the survey design fails to properly consider that not all the food acquired by a household is consumed during the survey reference period, and that food can be consumed during the reference period that was acquired earlier. Their findings are reproduced with minor changes in the remainder of this section and summarized in Table 1 . Table 1 Completeness of enumeration of food acquisition or food consumption or both Source: Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat (2014). For the food data in HCES to be reliably collected, there must be full accounting of either all acquired food intended for consumption or all food that was consumed over the recall period. Additionally, only the food intended for 27 consumption (when acquisit ion focused) or consumed (when consumption focused) during the reference period must be included, not any additional food. The following exclusion and inclusion accounting errors can adversely affect the collection of HCES food data: (1) Acquisition surve ys: rule -out leading question on consumption. If a leading or \"filter\" question on consumption of each food item over the recall period is answered \"no,\" collection of further data on the acquisition of the food can be ruled out . In this case, respondents are first asked whether they consumed each food item in the food list for a recall period of up to one year before the time of the survey. Then, they are asked how much was purchased, consumed from own production, or received in kind over the survey recall period for food data collection. However, if the respondent answers \"no\" to the leading question, the instructions skip to the next item, then, the household receives a zero for acquisitions of the food item regardless of whether or not it was acquired. T his leads to systematic underestimation of the quantities and expenditures on food acquired. A rule -out leading question on consumption is considered to be a problem when the two recall periods are less than or equal to two months apart. Note that this iss ue does not aff ect diary surveys because there is no pre -listing of foods to rule out. (2) Acquisition surveys: rule -out, short -recall -period leading question on acquisition. Here, if answered \"no ,\" a short -recall -period leading question on acquisition of each food item rules out further data collection on the acquisition of the food over the (longer) survey recall period. In this case, respondents are first asked whether or not they acquired each food item over the short recall period (e.g., two weeks). F urther information is collected on the acquisitions of the food for the longer recall period for food data collection only for those food items that were acquired over the shorter recall period. This leads to underestimation of mean food acquisition for th e population. (3) Acquisition surveys: rule -out leading question on food purchases. In this case, if a respondent reports that the household did not purchase a food item, then no further information is collected on other forms of acquisition of that food item. As home -produced or in -kind receipts are left out, this problem also leads to underestimation of mean food acquisition for the population. (4) Data collected on food harvested rather than food consumed from home production. When interviewees declare food harvested instead of food consumed from own production or food from own production for consumption, the quantities and expenditure on food acquired include those entering into the households' production stocks - not the household pantry for immediate consumption - and are systematic overestimates of food consumed from home production. A similar situation occurs when there are household animals, such as poultry and pigs, that may eat some of the food that was harvested from household food gardens (e.g. , undersized tubers, and food that is deemed as otherwise unfit for human consumption given the food availability at the time). 28 (5) Ambiguity about whether to report on acquisition or consumption. The question asked to respondents does not make it clear wh ether they are expected to report on their acquisitions or consumption of each food item over the recall period. This problem leads to inaccuracies in the calculation of the mean acquisition or consumption for the population and measures of inequality. (6) Routine month surveys: Ambiguity about whether respondents should report on the routine month in the recall period or only on those months in which the food item is actually consumed. In many routine -month surveys, respondents are first asked to report o n the number of months in the past year in which each food item was consumed. Immediately following, they are asked about the usual or average amount per month. Some questionnaires, however, fail to specify whether the average should be for those months in which it was consumed or for any month in the last year. When this type of accounting error occurs, some households may report on the former and some the latter, leading to over - or underestimation of their consumption of any food item for which a positiv e number of months was reported for the initial question. As can be seen in Table 1, 11 percent of the assessment surveys suffer from the use of the three types of rule -out leading questions. The collection of data on food harvested rather than food consu med from home production is a relatively rare problem, which affects only 2 percent of the surveys. A full 14 percent of the surveys had problems of ambiguity in what is to be reported, which likely leads to incomplete enumeration for some households. The problem of ambiguity in expected reporting for routine month surveys was identified in 8 percent of the surveys. Overall, 25 percent of the surveys had not met the reliability criterion for completeness of enumeration, that is, they were affected by some o f the identified problems of incomplete enumeration. Note that the large majority of the surveys with those types of accounting problems are interview surveys. 2.4. Meal participation The size of a household is only a proxy for the number of food consumers in the household during the reference period. Per -capita measures of food consumption should be based on the number of people who actually take part in the meals (food partakers) in t he household (Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat , 2014; Weisell and Dop, 2012). People other than household members who could take part in the household's meals include employees who had their meals in the household, guests , and visitors. The number of food parta kers should exclude household members not present in the household during the reference period. Adjustment for food partakers m ay not be an issue for poverty measures, but collecting that information is essential for the analysis of habitual per capita fo od consumption and food security estimates. Indeed, nutrient inadequacy is assessed with reference to requirements that are expressed in a per person basis. 29 Household surveys collect information on total amount of food consumed by households over a certain reference period. To convert this information to a per capita basis, it is important to account for meal participation in the household. The most common way to do this is to consider the number of people who consumed the total amount of food reported by t he household. Box 3 Estimating average per capita di etary energy consumption Based on household size and the number of partakers, per capita DEC of a household i can be calculated in two ways. First by dividing the total number of daily calories consumed in a household by the exact number of people who participated in the meals = or, if the above is not available, by dividing total household calories by the number of household members = In the latter case, food consumption is underestimated if mean consumption is calculated on the basis of household size. When food is provided also to non -household member partakers, the total food consumption in the household increas es. The household's mean consumption should be correctly calculated by dividing total household food consumption by household size plus additional partakers minus absent household members. In omitting the additional partakers from the calculation, the deno minator is smaller and the household's mean consumption is overestimated. If absent household members are not subtracted from household size, the denominator is higher and household's mean consumption is underestimated. However, there is no standard app roach to capturing information on meal participation in households, and many surveys fail to collect that information. Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat (2014), in their survey assessment, find that only 15 of 100 surveys ask whether non -household members were p resent or consumed meals in the household during the recall period. Even within this small number, there is variability on the additional information collected, with 11 asking about the number of visitors in the household, 10 about the number of meals they consumed, and a handful also asking information on the length of stay, type of meals they consumed , and age and sex of the guests. Fiedler and Mwangi (2016) provide a thorough description of approaches to collecting partakers. Reviewing 17 recent surveys, they found 16 different possible questions combined in various ways, with no two countries collecting the same information on partakers ( Table 2). 30 Table 2 Approaches to collecting information on partakers in 17 household consumption and expenditure surveys Source : Fiedler and Mwangi (2016). Partaker correction should in theory have no impact on the overall sample mean of per capita food consumption because positive and negative deviations from the household size balance out.18 On average, the household size should be equal to the number of partakers. The multivariate analysis of 81 HCES19 that were conducted between 1988 and 2014 (Conforti, Gr\u00fcnberger , and Troubat , 2017) indicated no significant difference between the mean and the coefficien t of variance of DEC per capita accounting for partakers, when controlling for other survey characteristics. However, there is empirical evidence to believe that not accounting for partakers distorts the distribution of p er capita DEC. In analyzing surveys from Kenya and the Philippines that collect information on partakers, Bouis, Haddad , and Kennedy (1992) and Bouis (1994) show that the relative difference between mean DEC of the first and fourth quartile is much lower when partakers are accounted for. Similarly, using an urban survey, Gibson and Rozelle (2012) show how using the roster of meal partakers lowers the apparent calorie availability of the richest quartile by 7 percent and raises the calories of the poorest, in cases in which this pattern results from a coping 18 If meals consumed in another household have a corresponding entry as meals given to another household. 19 Surveys analysed by the FAO food security analysis team from 2006 to 2014, using the ADePT - FSM software developed jointly by FAO and the World Bank (Moltedo et al. , 2014).

Those studies, therefore, provide evidence that the variability of DEC conditional on household income is lower if data are adjusted for partakers. Results in line with those of Bouis, Haddad , and Kennedy (1992) were confirmed by a similar analysis conducted by FAO on food data collected in the 2010 Bangladesh survey (Gr\u00fcnberger, 2017b). In that survey, information was collect ed daily on the number of people partaking in the meal, by gender and age groups. The variability of DEC conditional on income is much lower once DEC was adjusted for partakers, and the difference between household size and the number of partakers increase d monotonically with income (Figure 5 ). A clear upward trend in the difference between per capita and partakers -adjusted mean DEC can be observed between the bottom and the top decile. Figure 5 Differences in household size and mean dietary energy consumption per capita when adjusting for partakers Source : Gr\u00fcnberger (2017b). Researchers from the FAO Statistics Division analyzed five surveys that collected information on partakers and found t hat the coefficient of variation of DEC was systematically lower when household size was adjusted for partakers, even though the five surveys use d different approaches to collect data on partakers (Table 3 ). In the 2010 Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey, the respondents were asked to report daily on the number of people present in the household and their demographic characteristics. In the Household Socio -Economic Survey 2007 -2008 of Mongolia, information on the number of visitors and the number of days they stayed in the household was collected. In the 2007 -08 Afghanistan National Risk and Vulnerability Assessment and a survey conducted by Niger in 2011 , respondents were asked to report on the number of meals and number of days that visitors stayed in their house. Finally, in the 2010/11 Uganda National Household Survey, information was collected on the number of people present in the household during the reference period. The reference period is sometimes different than that of the food module , which was observed for the Household Socio -Economic Survey 2007 -2008 of Mongolia. Despite the difference in approaches, i n all five countries, the coefficient of variation of DEC is systematically lower when household size is adjusted for 32 partakers. The method designed by FAO to correct for excess variability fails to correct it because of the omission of partakers.20 In terms of overall impact on the estimate of the prevalence of undernourishment, the effect of not -corrected partakers may lead to an over - or underestimation , as a higher per capita DEC may counterbalance the effects of the higher variability.

In several countrie s, the questionnaires appear to capture only a portion of the requisite information and the results are likely subject to considerable measurement error. 20 The FAO methodology should be able to correct for the excess variability because of the non - adjustment for partakers: for two (Bangladesh and Uganda) of the five countries analysed, the coefficient of variation corrected based on DEC using househol d size and the coefficient of variation corrected based on DEC using partakers were found to be different. 21 This discussion is based on Fiedler and Mwang (2016). 33 Furthermore, there are several reasons why it is believed that the importance of, and need for, those adjustments is increasing; foremost is the secular, seemingly universal trend of the growing practice of consuming food away from home. It is noteworthy that, by implication, those studies may not provide an accurate portrayal of the actual situation in s everal of the studied countries: i.e. the findings may be false negatives regarding the importance of making adjustments for meal participation. This is especially likely to be the case in countries where there is greater travel away from home and where, m ore generally, there is a more widespread practice of eating away from home. It is, therefore, difficult to make any definitive assessments about the value of making adjustments for meals, or about the feasibility or best practices of collecting the requis ite information to make the adjustments. A review of select questionnaires of more recent household socio-economic surveys have revealed that over the course of the past few years a number of countries \u2014 India, Malawi, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda , and the United Republic of Tanzania, among others \u2014 have introduced new questions to identify who among the household's members were meal partakers and which meals were eaten away from home, and by whom. Several of the surveys have also inquired about mea ls that households provide to non -household members. Those modifications appear to have been motivated by concerns that food away from home is increasing in frequency, is significantly underreported, and is distorting the precision of food security analyse s. 2.5. Food away from home Consumption patterns are rapidly changing across the developing world, with prepared and packaged meals and meals consumed outside the home taking an ever-growing share of the households' food budget. Amid rising incomes, urbani zation, women entering the labor force, and children eating at schools, among various reasons, this trend is expected to persist as economies transition to middle -income status (Maxwell and Slater, 2003; FAO, 2006; Popkin, 2008; Smith, 2013; U SDA , 2011). A s food away from home gains importance, failing to appropriately measure this component of food consumption and expenditure will make comparisons of consumption patterns and poverty less and less meaningful. In the United States, the share of food away fro m home in total food expenditure increased from 10 to 50 percent during the twentieth century. In urban China, total expenditure on food away from home increased by 63 percent between 1995 and 2001 (Ma et al. , 2006; see Figure 6 ). Household per capita expenditure on food away from home rose at an average annual rate of 9.5 percent in China from 2002 to 2011, while the share of food away from home in total food expenditure increased from 18.2 percent to 21.5 percent (You, 2014). In Egypt and India, the prevalence of meals eaten away from home almost doubled in less than 20 years. 34 Figure 6.

USDA -ERS ( 26/1/2016) (left panel); Gibson (2016) (right panel). Taking into account food away from home consum ption is particularly important for measuring calorie consumption, as food consumed outside the home tends to be more calorie -dense than food consumed at home (Poti, Duffey , and Popkin, 2011; Mancino, Todd , and Lin, 2009) and the amount of food consumed away tends to increase m o r e r a p i d l y , i n l i n e w i t h increases in income. Figure 7. Energy intake from food away from home (%) Source s: R. Vakis, Improving measurement of Food Away from Home (FAFH) - presentation 35 Food away from home has been found to contribute to as much as 36 percent of the daily energy intake among men in urban Kenya, and 59 percent among women in urban Nigeria (Oguntona and Tella, 1999; van't Riet et al ., 2003). Among the younger population, fo od away from home contributes, for example, to 18 percent and 40 percent of the daily energy intake among Chinese children and school -going adolescents in Benin, respectively (Liu et al., 2015; Nago et al ., 2010). Most nationally representative household surveys have not kept up with the pace of change in food pathways and collect very limited information on food away from home. Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat (2014), when assessing the relevance and reliability of thei r sample of 100 surveys, found that 90 percent of the surveys consider food away from home in some form, but that most of the approaches are \"ad hoc and unsatisfactory .\" For example, 25 percent of the surveys aim to capture all related household consumptio n from food away from home using just one question; one in five surveys considers multiple places of consumption; only 35 percent take snacks explicitly into account (when most snacking is expected to take place out of the home); and close to 50 percent of the surveys do not include food away from home received in kind . While it is widely recognized that food away from home is subject to considerable measurement error, the exact amount it contributes to underestimating consumption is unknown. However, as f ood away from home is expected to increase as a proportion of total food consumed and total food expenditure, if no changes are made in the way th at information is collected, the magnitude of that underestimation is expected to increase. As it does, it wil l exacerbate the instability of household consumption and expenditure surveys based on estimates of food insecurity and under -nutrition as currently measured, (Tandon and Landes, D'Souza and Tandon, 2014; Smith, 2015), obfuscate trends , and prompt mo re researchers to question whether even the general order of magnitude of the estimates of global under -nutrition should be accepted (Banerjee and Duflo, 2011). The inadequate collection of food away from home data urgently needs to be better understood an d systematically improved. Only a few studies have analyzed the implications that failing to account for food away from home can have on food security analysis.22,23 In a study conducted in India, Smith (2013) argues that the great Indian calorie debate, originated by an 22 With obesity increasingly becoming a pressing health issue in some middle -income countries, the link between eating out and obesity is also drawing attention in the developing world (Bezerra and Sichieri, 2009). 23 The literature on food away from home in the developed world has a longer history in which the main focus has been on health and nutr ition issues. There is widespread interest in studying the differences in the caloric and nutritional composition of the food provided by commercial outlets relative to home -made food, with the objective of understanding the health consequences of eating out (Vandevijvere et al. , 2009 ). In particular, high calorie concentration found in certain meals raised particular concern, giving rise to a body of research devoted to understanding the link between obesity and eating out, among other health outcomes (Bur ns, Jackson, and Gibbons, 2002; Guthrie, and Jakanowsky. 2004). There is also interest in establishing food -based dietary guidelines to prevent obesity and related chronic diseases developed l ater in life (Phillips et al., 2013). 36 apparent increase in undernourishment at the time of falling poverty rates, can be partly explained by inaccurate data on calorie intake because of t he lack of measurement of food away from home. Similarly, Borlizzi, del Grossi , and Cafiero (2017) show in Brazil how the distribution of food consumption by income strata changes once food consumed at school is taken into account. In particular, they show that proper accounting for food received through a school feeding program targeted at the poorer strata of the population results in a more equal distribution of food consumption than previously thought. Capturing food away from home increases mean DEC, a s it is an important food source, especially in urban areas. Smith (2015) shows that food away from home is positively correlated with the estimated mean dietary energy consumption. In many household consumption and expenditure surveys, food away from home is only measured in terms of monetary value. However, as meals eaten outside the home are different than meals at home (Rimmer, 2001), the conversion of monetary value into calories can be misleading if home food consumption is used as a benchmark to calc ulate calories from food away from home. Using data for Peru, Farf\u00e1n , Genoni, and Vakis (2017) evaluated the impact of accounting for food away from home on poverty and consumption inequality estimates. They show that from a theoretical point of view the d irection of the effect on poverty or inequality cannot be predicted ex ante. Empirically, they demonstrate that failure to adequately capture food away from home may generate serious biases in estimates of households' expenditure patterns and welfare measures and may change the underlying profile of the poor. There is considerable evidence about a large variety of socio -economic factors associated with eating away from home. Measurement error from neglecting food away from home may, therefore, bias wel fare analyses along those lines. In several countries, geography, household size and composition have been shown to be systematically related to the incidence and level of food away from home consumption and expenditure (Meenakshi and Ray, 1999; Mihalopoul os and Demoussis, 2001; Yen and Jones, 1997; Mutlu and Gracia, 2006; Meng et al., 2012). Households composed mainly of the elderly have also been found to have lower probabilities of relying on, and lower expenditure on, food away from home (Redman, 1980; Meng et al. , 2012; Liu et al. , 2015). Conceptual and practical challenges make integrating food away from home in household surveys a complex exercise. First, a clear definition of what is meant by food away from home is needed. Figure 8 contains an outli ne of a useful way to conceptualize and measure food away from home along with some key measurement issues to consider. Food away from home can refer to food produced outside, regardless of whether the food is consumed outside or inside the home. In that case, takeout meals would be considered food away from home. Alternatively, it can refer to food consumed outside irrespective of the origin of the food. Under that sce nario, home -made meals consumed at work or at school would be a component of food away from home. While there is a general preference towards defining food away from home based on the place of preparation of the food, a clear protocol that takes into accou nt all the different pieces is required to be well defined regardless of 37 the concept that is adopted. A second element to consider when collecting information on food away from home is snacks, which in modern eating habits are more likely to be consumed ou tside the home. Finally, there can be different modes of acquisition of the food, including purchased food or food received in kind, each of which can originate from multiple sources, such as from commercial establishments, social program s, and other house holds. While a great deal of attention has been paid to food that household member purchases and, to a lesser extent, food (or meals) that household members receive free as part of a social intervention (most commonly a school meal), there is evidence from China and India that \"hosted\" meals provided free to friends or relatives are also an important, distinct category (Bai et al., 2010; Fiedler 2015). In China, \"hosted\" meals were found to account for nearly 50 percent of all food away from home and to be disproportionately important for lower income groups. In India, they accounted for 29 percent of all meals away from home, and 36 percent of all persons with at least one meal away from home reported having at least one hosted meal provided by another hous ehold. Figure 8 Defining food away from home (FAFH) Source : Smith, Lisa C . and Timothy R. Frankenberger. 2012. Typology of food away from home. TANGO International, Tucson, AZ . Of the issues covered in the guidelines, this is probably the area which is the most difficult to trace one set of agreed upon international practices. The discussion that follows is centred on a food away from home definition based on where the food is pr epared. The inclusion of food prepared at home but eaten outside would most likely result in double counting as the ingredients would already be 38 accounted for under the category food available in the household from different sources. In addition, while for food at home, the main food preparer is likely to be adequately informed about the food consumed by all household members, no one individual will be in such a privileged position to report about the food consumption patterns of other household members away from home. Food away from home may, therefore, need s to be captured at the individual level, interviewing different respondents when possible.24 An additional question relates to what information to collect from respondents. For nutrition and food security analysis, it is be important to have information (from within the survey or from other sources that can be integrated into the survey ) on what is eaten, which is a challenge for food away from home, as meal content is likely unknown to the consume r.25 Options include: differentiating between meal, drink and snacks; asking by eating occasion (breakfast, midday snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner); reporting the source of preparation (commercial, government or social program, employer, other household); differentiating by the type of establishment (fine dining, fast-food restaurant, street vendor); reporting day of the week (or weekday or weekend). Note that snacks can be as if not more important than some meals in terms of both calories and expenditure. As a result, it is very important that they are adequately captured in the data -collection instrument. In recognition of those challenges, several low - and middle -income countries have in recent years adopted innovative approaches to food away from home data collection. Details of experiences from India, Peru and the West Africa Economic and Monetary Union are detailed in the Annex 2.26 In the United States, USDA has recently introduced the Household Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey , which collects data at the individual level through food books . Attention to food away from home is ensured by including a reminder in the food books to record meals, snacks and drinks consumed at a number of different outlets, such as at school, work, a relativ e's home , or recreational sites. Kirlin and Denbaly (2017) provide a detailed account of data collection in this survey. With all their differences, those approaches to collecting food away from home in recent Household Consumption and Expenditure Surveys in such different settings have a number of aspects in common that can be useful in developing 24 In a small -scale study in an urban slum in India Sujatha et al. (1997) interviews husbands and wives about the men's dietary intake, and find that women are not aware of the foods consumed by their spouses outside of their home. Similarly, Gewa, Murphy, and Neumann (2007) find that mothers of rural school -aged Kenyan children missed 77 percent and 41 percent of the energy intake originated in food away from home in the food shortage and harvest seasons, respectively ( where food away from home contributes to 13 percent and 19 percent of daily energy intake in each season. Collecting data from children is particularly challenging and not commonly done in household surveys in low - and middle -income countries. The report r ecommends a proxy respondent for children mainly because this is a widely accepted approach in practice and there is no established viable alternative implemented at scale. This is a topic that warrants further research given the growing importance of food away from home and publicly financed feeding programs, on children's diets. 25 The caloric and nutritional content of meals consumed away from home can be sourced through complementary data sources, either purposely run surveys (as the survey of food estab lishments conducted in Lima and described in (Farf\u00e1n, Genoni, and Vakis, 2017) or via administrative data, such as in the case of school meals. 26 See Annex 2 39 international standards for data collection directed at low -income countries: all surveys collect data at the individual level and all surveys differentiate mea l types and make explicit reference to snacks. 2.6. List of food items The design of the list of food items included in a survey affects how food consumption is reported by respondents (Deaton and Grosh, 2000; Gibson, 2005). As a list with more items is lik ely to help respondents more accurately remembering their consumption or acquisition events, a longer and more disaggregated food list results in higher reported consumption (Beegle ., 2012; Carrol , 2015). However, very long fo od lists can quickly lead to greater respondent and interviewer fatigue (Gibson, 2005). The choice of items to be included needs also to be country specific to reflect differences in diets. An \"optimal\" food list length should balance the lower memory laps es and the lower costs and interview time associated with short lists, with the better recall and more comprehensive reporting associated with the longer list. Interview -based surveys, in which food items are predefined and listed, should include a suffic ient number of food items to help respondents accurately remember what has been acquired or consumed or both. The list should fit all households in a given population, from poorest rural to richest urban households consuming a very wide variety of foods. D iary-based surveys can use a predefined list or be open -ended. The sample of surveys analyzed in Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat (2014)27 reveals substantial variability in the number of food items in HCES globally. The mean number of food items in diary -based surveys in their review is far higher than in interview -based surveys (229 and 102, respectively). The number of food items spans gr eatly across surveys, from a low of 19 to a high of 677. When the number of food items recorded by respondents is not predetermined, the aggregated list of items is usually far longer than the predefined list, which, in turn, affect the value of reported c onsumption. Tucker and Bennett (1988) report that diaries of an experimental United States survey with preprinted items lead to higher total expenditure estimates than blank fill -in diaries, especially for older persons (see also Tucker, 1992). Several st udies in low - and middle -income countries indicate that longer disaggregated lists result in higher food consumption reporting than shorter aggregated lists. In the experimental study of Beegle et al. (2012), seven -day recall interviews with lists of 58, 1 7 and 11 food items were tested; the list with 58 items returned the highest consumption estimate. Jolliffe (2001) reports that for a survey in El Salvador, a longer food item list (72 items) resulted in 20 percent higher food consumption compared to quest ionnaires with only 18 aggregated food categories. Food data collected in a Jamaican experimental 27 The numbers reported herein exclude the Brazil diary survey, which is a significant outlier at 5,407 items. Many of the items are, however, simply similar items named or spelled differently. 40 survey show 26 percent higher consumption with 119 items compared to 37 items (Statistical Institute and Planning Institute of Jamaica, 1996). In Indonesia's SUSENAS survey, questionnaires with extensive item lists (218 items) showed about 7 percent higher food consumption than questionnaires that had only 15 aggregated food categories (Pradhan, 2009) . The longer list required a much smaller than proportionate increase in time relative to the increase in the number of items, although published figures from the study combined the food and non -food consumption lists (52 minutes for 23 items and 82 minutes for 320 items). Similarly, in the United Republic of Tanz ania (Beegle et al. 2012), reducing the list length by as much as 80 percent resulted in a reduction in interview times by only 17 percent (49 and 41 minutes for the 58 - and 17 -item lists, respectively). Additionally, Bradburn (2010) has noted that groupin g questions (and food types) can help to minimize the cognitive effort for respondents to recall the requested information, leading to lower recall error. This implies, for example, that food away from home questions should be reported in a separate group. Friedman et al . (2017) decompose the error response in food consumption measurement into two different components: the omission of any consumption item, and the error in reporting the value. The shorter food list has lower consumption incidence as compar ed to a diary survey benchmark for the large majority of food groups, while for consumption value (conditional on positive consumption) the subset list module , which is characterized as having the most over-reports of consumption in comparison to the diary benchmark. Analyses of the Food Frequency Questionnaires (FFQs) often used by nutritionists also support the use of longer lists. Wakai (2009) finds that long FFQs (97+ foods) display higher correlation with weighed food records (r=0.42 to 0.52), than sh ort FFQs (< 70 food items, r=0.31 to 0.45). Similarly, Henr\u00edquez - S\u00e1nchez (2009) finds that FFQs with >100 food items correlated more strongly with weighed food records (r=0.52) than FFQs with less than 100 items (r=0.47). A longer, more qualitatively diffe rentiated food list is preferable. In summary, given that the incremental interview time required for additional items is relatively small, having a relatively long list is recommended. On the other hand, one should not underplay the possibility that a lo nger interview time may prompt enumerators to take shortcuts in interviewing (Finn and Ranchhod, 2015) and respondents to refuse to participate or terminate the interview ahead of the required time (Deaton and Grosh, 2000). This is particularly the case wh en a questionnaire has a cascading structure, as respondents are more likely to not report some expenditure to skip other questions (Kreuter et al ., 2011). In the following paragraphs, some criteria that can help practitioners deal with this complex balanc ing act are discussed. A major recommendation in drawing a food list is to align the food list with standard international classification systems. The U nited Nations COICOP provides the reference international classification for individual consumption expenditures. It is an integral part of the System of National Accounts, intended for use in household consumption and expenditure surveys and for the 41 compilation of cons umer price indices, as well as international comparisons of gross domestic product and its component expenditures through purchasing power parities. Between 2012 and 2017, COICOP went through a major revision , resulting in COICOP 2018 .28 This version , which was endorsed by UNSC in March 2018 ,29 provides greater granularity as compared to the past , thanks to the introduction of an additional level of detail (from a three - to four -level structure ).30 FAO actively participated in the process , leading the revision of Division 01 on food and non -alcoholic beverages, particularly taking into account and advocating the need to ensure relevance for low - and middle -income countries. To supplement the official structure, and to guide countries expanding Division 01 in th eir national versions, FAO also developed an official annex to COICOP , which includ es 307 additional food products at the fifth level. The annex is included in the COICOP publication Another source for standard classification is FoodEx2, a comprehensive fo od classification carried out by the European Food Safety Authority, which was recently updated to cover global needs (European Food Safety Authority, 2014). FoodEx2 is an additional reference classification of particular relevance when a survey is expecte d to be used to conduct nutrition analysis. An important external reference to consider when drawing a survey food list is food composition tables. Included items in the food list must match unambiguously to an entry in the food composition table in order to convert food quantities into nutrient quantities (FAO/INFOODS, 2012) . 31 This is extremely important if the data are to be used for nutrition and food security analysis, as calorie and nutrient composition can only be derived if the food items can be matched at the analysis stage to a corresponding relevant food composition table. The conversion table should ideally be finalized before the survey goes to the field to ensure that the breakdown of the food items is compatible and that the availabi lity of nutrient content data can inform the design of the survey food list.32 The length and composition of the food list should be formulated , bearing in mind how data are supposed to be used. From a welfare perspective, it is essential that the items representing the large majority of food expenditures are included. From a nutrition perspective, th e food items that are important sources of nutrients in individual diets must be included ; items that contribute little to the understanding of individual nutrient intake are less important. As a result, welfare and nutrition requirements do not necessarily correspond. Accordingly, choices pertaining to the food list tend to be \"topic oriented\", even if surveys are meant to be designed for a wi de range of users. A nutrition -oriented food list is likely to 28 COICOP 2018 can be downloaded at https://unstats.u n.org/unsd/statcom/49th - session/documents/BG -Item3l -Classification -2-E.pdf 29 Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 2018, Supplement No. 4 (E/2018/24 - E/CN.3/2018/3). 30 Sixty -eight new classes at the third level and 337 new subclasses at the fourth level. 31 It is also recommended that countries invest in the development of good reference food composition tables and in keeping them up to date. 32 If a food composition table is available, it can also be used to pre -program computer -assisted personal interviewing software to perform built -in checks for excessive consumption and speed up data analysis and cleaning. 42 include more items than a welfare -oriented list. One common solution in HCES is to list the most common food items consumed by the population, and include \"other, specify\" items in each categor y in the parts of the survey in which acquisition or consumption of additional food items can be recorded. However, this entails additional challenges if the intention is to estimate nutrient contents, as the matching with a food composition table becomes uncertain .33 Finally, when the objective is to collect data in order to evaluate the impact of a nutrient fortification program , the food list should include all food items that are directly fortified with such nutrients and their products. For example, if there is an interest in assessing the nutritional impact of fortified wheat flour, the list of foods should include fortified wheat flour and the products made with th at type of flour, such as bread, biscuits , and pies. As diets evolve, food lists must be regularly updated to reflect dietary changes. This is particularly relevant in urban areas where a wider variety of food s is typically eaten, and processed foods34 and prepared foods form a larger share of the diets (Popkin, Adair , and Ng, 2012) and budgets. Again, a nutrition perspective entails a higher specificity of the food list, including and distinguishing different levels of food processing, from minimally processed foods such as yogurt , cheese, bread and frozen vegetables, to highly -processed and ultra -processed foods rich in sugar, fat , and salt , which have been shown to be associated with obesity and other diet -related diseases .35 Using data from Brazil, for instance, a recent paper by Louzada et al. (2017) concludes that H CES hold potential in reporting consumption of ultra -processed foods, as there is substantial convergence between the data collected in an individual dietary intake survey and HCES data in terms of relative energy consumption from ultra - processed foods. 2.7. Non-standard units of measurement To be meaningful, food quantities collected through HCES need to be standardized; this allows for the aggregation and comparison of consumption across food items and geographical areas, or for translation into nutrient content.36 In m any surveys , units are not standardized, especially in those 33 See Fiedler and Mwangi (2016) for a discussion on this issue. 34 Processed food is defined as: \"Any food other than a raw agricultural commodity and includes any raw agricultural commodity that has been subject to processing, such as canning, cooking, freezing, dehydration, or milling\" (USDA (1946). 35 The Brazilian dietary guidelines include a classification of foods by level of processi ng. See, for example Brazil, Ministry of Health (2015). 36 Estimating the quantities of foods consumed away from home poses its own set of issues, mainly concerning the paucity of data broken down by individual food items. Nevertheless, quantities can be estimated if respondents report on the foods and dishes that were consumed rather than only their total expenditures (see Smith and Subandoro (2007) for the detailed methodology to be used when this information is available at https://unstats.un.org/unsd/st atcom. 43 conducted in sub-Saharan Africa where non -standard units are commonly used in daily life (Deaton and Dupriez, 2011). Smith and Subandoro (2007) have identified seven primary metho ds for collecting information about consumption quantities, and advocate using a combination of those methods, as one method may be the optimal solution for certain items, but it may not be appropriate for others. 1. Metric (i.e. standard) units: Respondents report quantities in metric units , such as kilograms or liters. 2. Monetary value: Respondents report the monetary value of the quantity consumed. 3. Local (i.e. non -standard) units , such as piles, baskets, or bunches. 4. A count of pieces: a type of non -standard unit. 5. Volumetric equivalents: respondents demonstrate how much space the food they consumed would take up.37 6. Linear dimensions: respondents provide linear measurements (length and width or circumference) for the amount of food consumed. As Smith and Suban doro (2007) point out, this method likely takes more time to complete , as it requires physical measurement rather than a simple vocal response. 7. Food models: respondents choose a two - or three -dimensional depiction of a food item that best corresponds to th eir consumption. Three-dimensional models can provide very accurate estimates, but it can be costly to prepare the models and calculate their weights. For all but the first method, additional data are required to convert the reported information into stan dardized, comparable (metric) quantities. Collecting quantities in non -standard units or restricting respondents to only reporting in standard units involves trade -offs in accuracy and feasibility. In the sample of HCES analyzed by Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat (2014), the most common method employed is requiring respondents to report in a metric unit of measure. This method is usually the easiest to administer with the lowest budget and time cost; it also requires the least amount of post -data proce ssing , as the units are already comparable across items. However, restricting respondents to using only standard units may result in inaccurate estimates, especially when respondents are not accustomed to using them for all of the items they consume. Repo rting quantities in non -standard units is quite common for a wide range of commodities, especially in sub-Sahara n Africa . For example, in the second wave of the Ethiopia Socioeconomic Survey from 2013 to 2014 in which non -standard units were allowed, nearl y 50 percent of farmers chose to report their harvests in non -standard units. In the Malawi National Panel Survey, respondents chose non -standard units about 73 percent of the time. This strong ly indicates that many respondents are more comfortable reporti ng quantities in non -standard units. Accordingly, allowing them to be used 37 An advantage of bounded recall is that the initial visit to begin the recall period also allows survey teams to distribute standardized volumetric containers, such as an empty sack. This can be especially helpful in cases in which bulky root crops or plantains are dietary staples because a rural household might fill a sack several times over in the course of a week, with root crop consumption of 50 kg or more. The Papua New Guinea survey used by Gibson (2001) distributed empty 25 kg sacks and these were the preferred non -standard units for all root crops and vegetables, with local weighing trials for converting sacks (and partial sacks) into kilograms. 44 eases the burden on respondents in terms of memory recall and conversion calculations , reducing the accuracy of the resulting data. Recent studies show that asking respondents to co mbine memory recall with cognitive tasks, such as abstracting consumption to a \"typical week or month ,\" leads to less accurate self -reporting (Beegle et al., 2010). The forced conversion from non -standard to standard unit s similarly combines cognitive and memory recall ; respondents must (a) have a clear understanding of what a standard unit of the food item is (e.g. how much is a kilogram of rice); (b) estimate how many standard units correspond to the non -standard unit they are familiar with; and (c) use t he conversion from step two to convert the quantity consumed into standard units. The three stages place a cognitive burden on the respondent and can lead to a sizable measurement error. It is also common practice for such calculations to be conducted in-situ, often on -the-fly (as the respondent makes the calculations in their head, perhaps prompted or assisted by an interviewer), further increasing the likelihood for error. Accordingly, the most important and overriding benefit of allowing respondents to report quantities using non -standard units is that they will likely report more accurately on consumed quantities. Results from a recent methodological study of land area measurement support the preference for non -standard units. Carletto et al. (2016) finds that when respondents are allowed to report land area in non - standard units - instead of being forced to convert an area to standard units - the self-reported estimates are much more accurate. The additional costs and challenges associated w ith this method broadly fall into two categories: those associated with preparation and implementation of a survey with non -standard units; and ensuring that non -standard units measurements can be converted into comparable standard units. Before non -stand ard units can be used, country -specific information on common non-standard units is needed to determine the list of allowable item -unit combinations. Non -standard units must also be accompanied by standard unit conversion factors. To directly compare and a ggregate quantities, the data user must convert all quantities into a common standard unit , such as kilograms. Cap\u00e9au (1995) and Cap\u00e9au and Dercon (2006) suggest using econometric techniques to compare unit values and estimate conversion factors that are relatively simple to implement. The challenge with that approach is that unit values can vary as a result of quality differences (Deaton, 1997), or from price discounts on larger units (Attanasio and Frayne, 2006) , or over time and space because of the impa ct of transport and storage costs (Gibson and Kim, 2015). The sources of variability in unit values that are unrelated to mass or volume can result in distorted or imprecisely estimated conversion factors (Oseni, Durazo , and McGee, 2017). An alternative m ethod is to collect weights for each allowable item -unit combination and use them to create conversion factors. This is a relatively straightforward concept . However , there are a whole set of challenges involved in in properly implement ing this concept . The standard weight for the same item - unit combination can vary, even within a country. For example, Casley and Kumar (1988) found that in Nigeria, an average \"bundle\" of sorghum weigh ed 45 between 26 and 49 kilograms, depending on the area. Thus, region -specif ic conversion factors also need to be considered . Complicating matters further, different levels of processing (fresh, dried or powered) lead to different conversion factors for the same food item .38 This method has also been recently implemented in the context of a project of survey harmonization in the countries belonging to the West African Economic and Monetary Union , following the recent guidebook published by the World Bank (Oseni, Durazo , and M cGee, 2017 ) (see Box 4 for details). Box 4 Collection of conversion factors in context of the Western Africa Economic and Monetary Unit project As part of the Regional Program to Harmonize and Modernize Living Conditions Surveys in the West African Monetary Union, participating national statistical offices collect consumption data that allows reporting in non -standard units of measurement. To prepare for this, market surveys were conducted to establish conversion factors from non -standard units , such as bowls and heaps, to standard units (kg, litre) for commonly consumed food items. Following guidance from Oseni, Durazo , and McGee (2017), the national statistical offices conducted market surveys ahead of the main household surveys. In the spirit of harmonization, all countries involved in the program followed the same procedure. (a) Preparation phase : included a review of previous surveys and preli minary markets visits to identify products and commonly used non -standard units. The resulting product -unit list - and options to report additional found units - were program d into Survey Solutions, a computer -assisted personal interview software for data collection. (b) Field work: was conducted in the post -harvest season to ensure wider availability of products. Enumerators visited six markets (three rural, three urban) in each region, using tablets to collect measurements from up to three different vendors f or each product -unit combination. They also took photographs of each measurement which, thanks to the computer -assisted personal interview application, were automatically linked to the measurement data. (c) Data analysis: includes: o Data cleaning to detect outl iers and rearrange unit sizes according to the actual weights; o Calculation of national - and regional -level conversion factors using the median measured weight for each product -unit combination; and o Identification of the best photographs with actual weigh ts closest to each conversion factor. The resulting library of non -standard units materials will support the main household survey. Enumerators will use the photo albums to guide respondents in reporting food consumption quantities and the conversion factors will be used to flag unreasonable quantities for further verification, all ensuring greater data accuracy. 38 This is similar to food crops harvested under different conditions, such as threshed, shelled, f resh, and dried, which are proven to have a large impact on reported harvest quantities (Fermont and Benson, 2011; Diskin 1999; Murphy, Casley, and Curry, 1991). 46 Unit conversion factors are often incomplete and lack supporting documentation, which decreases the number of usable observations and makes it difficult to cross -reference quantities or apply conversions across different datasets. Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat (2014) pointed out that calculating metric food quantities is feasible for only 53 percent of the surveys reviewed. Most of the difficulties associated with this method can be addressed by ensuring that unit conversion factor data are thoroughly collected and properly documented. When information on most common non -standard units used and unit conversion factors is limited or not available, the survey team must collect those data. This is most effectively done by consulting with local experts and conducting a market survey prior to the start of the regular data colle ction. 47 3.Conclusions and recommendations This section presents the core of the guidelines, providing a set of recommended practices for data collection. The recommendations are based on the literature, empirical evidence , and considerations discussed in Section 2. The objective is to promote the adoption of good practices, and encourage the abandonment of some bad practices that are still employed in some surveys. Some of those recommendations are straightforward and easy to implement and some are grounded in firm empirical evidence, but some are based on balancing incomplete pieces of evidence with practical considerations. Additional research will be useful to reinforce the evidence base behind the entire set of recommend ations . A set of guidelines can, therefore, be extremely useful in informing design decisions and fostering cross -country comparability in approaches. Such guidelines can only be seen as temporary as best practices will evolve and depend on circumstances . As food consumption patterns evolve, statistical systems change , and new technologies become available, survey design will have to be adapted to stay relevant and cost - effective. It is anticipated that as more survey methodological work is performed and new lessons are learned from survey implementation, these guidelines will have to be periodically revised to incorporate the new knowledge being generated and to respond to additional or different data needs that may emerge. Furthermore, consumption patte rns change with income growth, changes in food technology and the modernization of food systems, response rates tend to decline in higher income economies and technology is already proceeding at a rapid pace with new technologies relevant to survey operati ons entering the market every day. In such a rapidly changing environment, the shelf life of these guidelines is inevitably going to be limited. Accordingly, it would be desirable revise and update them at least every 10 years. The overarching concern in drawing these recommendations has been to ensure the most appropriate balance between accuracy and cost effectiveness, keeping in mind the typical constraints facing low - and middle -income country statistical offices. In some cases, the recommendations off ered might entail a costlier option than what is currently practiced while , in other cases , it might imply a cost saving. The benefits should be assessed not only in terms of greater accuracy and comparability of the data being collected, but also whether the data can be made relevant for a wider user base (e.g. nutritionists and food security analysts, as well as statisticians and economists) . While professionals from th ose four fields contributed to the preparation of the guidelines, future revisions wo uld benefit from the involvement of an even broader range of scholars and experts. Food is part of our cultures and societies, and the way in which society (and survey respondents) relate to food is mediated by social and cultural constructs. Perhaps, anthropologists can be recruited to help in devising questionnaires that are better able to incorporate social and cultural aspects in data -collection processes and outcomes. Similarly, psychologists can help in designing more effective survey approaches by 48 providing insights on the cognitive process behind how respondents answer questions, when and how they shift from enumeration to estimation strategies, and how survey design should take that into account when thinking about such details as the recall period, the length of a list, and the sequencing of survey modules. One notable gap in the guidelines is the discussion of price data collection. Prices are clearly an important element of any analysis of poverty, and are essential for welfare comparisons acros s households, regions and time. Price data collection is also a major goal of HCES when they are required to inform CPI calculations. However, even just from a perspective of analyzing food consumption, food prices are needed to properly value consumption quantities, and attaining information on prices is invaluable in cross -checking the plausibility of reported values and quantities, especially when non -standard units are used. Also, as food policy often relies heavily on price interventions, measuring foo d prices is an important item for analysis in its own right. However, p rice data collection was omitted from the guidelines because it has implications that go well beyond food consumption, and also because i t is such an overarching topic , the view was tak en that price data collection would probably be best served by its own set of guidelines. It would have been difficult to discuss and make recommendations about price data collection with reference to food alone, abstracting from all the other demands on p rice data from other uses and users. It is also important to remind users that any change in method should have a controlled comparison to \"bridge\" the effects of the old and new methodologies on the resulting data. Concerns about losing comparability ov er time, and the difficulty of explaining to the public the difference in estimates that come with changes in methodology often prompt statistical offices to shy away from changes in survey design, even when it is clear that there would be gains in accurac y and cost savings in doing so. Building a controlled comparison in survey planning would ease those concerns somewhat. From that standpoint, this should be considered by statistical offices in low - and middle -income countries and the donors and internatio nal agencies assisting them whenever the implementation of a methodological change is being reviewed. One idea that was put forward as part of the international discussion leading to the guidelines was to create a global fund to support such controlled com parisons, as they are a source of invaluable learning and hence might be considered a global public good. Box 5 contains a summary of priority research areas for the collection of data on food consumption , based on gaps identified during the preparation of the guidelines. 49 Box 5 A research agenda for food consumption data collection The guidelines put forward clear recommendations based on existing evidence and experience accumulated in survey practices over the past decades, but also recognize that in several areas there is little sound methodological work to base recommendations on. A list of priority areas based on the gaps that were identified during the preparation of the document is provided below. Food away from home is an area f rom which different approaches are emerging, but there are only a limited number experimental methodological studies available. Given the increasing importance of this component in calories and expenditure, this is probably the area in which methodological research would be the largest. Several national statistical offices have signaled their interest in participating in methodological studies that would help improve the quality of the data they collect on food away from home. There are a number of differe nt aspects of the choice between diary and recall, and the length of the recall period that would benefit from more methodological studies. Only a handful of experimental studies have been conducted on the topic in low - and middle -income countries and a la rger evidence base would be required to make the extrapolation of results more robust. Specific questions in need of investigation in this domain are: Bounding of recall . One concern with a short recall period (such as seven - days) is telescoping. \"Boundi ng\" the recall period for a household with another visit to mark the beginning of the recall period can, in principle, help reduce telescoping and improve the quality of the recall. While this idea has been around for many years, it has not been formally t ested and compared to unbounded recall in a low - and middle -income country setting. Telephone interview aids . Telephones are increasingly used in surveys, including in low - and middle -income countries, as the coverage of the mobile phone network increase s. One way in which phones could help in person interviews is by using follow -up phone calls to aid the filling of a diary, or the collection of a second set of recall data. Multiple visits . One issue with seven -day recall discussed in the guidelines is that the data are affected by \"excess variability\". One way to reduce that is to perform a second non -consecutive interview to the same households (in person or possibly via telephone) (Gibson, 2016). This option is potentially attractive, but it has not been tested at scale. Expand the evidence -base. In general, many of the conclusions in the guidelines come from a small number of studies, with the SHWALITA dataset from United Republic of Tanzania exerting probably an excessive influence on the current consensus simply because of its uniqueness. Replicating more studies, in different settings and regions with a similar set -up would help to expand the knowledge base and provide more confidence when extrapolating results across countries. There are other topics that might benefit from more research that the guidelines have not touched upon. Some of them, which were also brought up during the global consultation, include the measurement of food waste, the measurement of individual consumption of specific po pulation subgroups, such as children and women of reproductive age, and the integration of different data sources. IAEG has called on countries to consider setting up a global fund that could finance the implementation of methodological studies and experim ents to test and validate survey design options in those domains. Finally, as with all survey design choices, countries implementing these recommendations should carefully evaluate the extent to which the adoption of them may increase the burden on the respondent, how that risk can be mitigated, and whether the return in terms of data quality is large enough to justify a 50 possible increase in non -response. As for the evaluation of survey costs, it is impossible to evaluate in principle th ose trade -offs with any level of accuracy and hence to be prescriptive about how to ha ndle th ose survey design choices. When implementing the guidelines in practice, however, care must be taken in finding the right balance between keeping the overall length of the survey manageable so as not to compromise the quality of the information coll ected. This section is developed as follows: for each domain discussed in Section 2, a summary of main findings is provided, followed by a set of recommendations . 3.1. Recall versus diary and length of reference period Summary The trade -offs between diary and recall and between shorter and longer recall periods have been highlighted in various survey experiments and analys es of diary and recall approaches. In low -income economies, evidence suggests that recall interviews are generally preferable to diary me thods for capturing food consumption when balancing implementation costs and the reliability of the resulting estimates. The majority of the studies have found that food consumption or monetary value data collected with recall interviews provides estimates that are similar to or higher than those recorded in diaries. However, depending on the implementation methods, diaries often show patterns of rapidly declining consumption (and data quality) over the reference period. Lower and decreasing consumption rec orded in diaries is frequently attributed to respondents' fatigue and illiteracy in combination with poor supervision. Under close supervision, diaries have proven to be reliable in several contexts and are sometimes considered to be the gold standard, but when implemented with appropriate levels of supervision (such as daily visits to households), they are generally costlier than recall surveys ; the detailed cost calculations by Beegle et al. (2012 ), suggest that diaries are from 6 to 10 times more expensi ve than recall after taking into account the fieldwork and the time-consuming coding and data entry requirements. Recall surveys are affected by memory decay (memory loss) as the recall period increases, and telescoping error (reporting of consumption outs ide of the recall period) for shorter periods. The experimental evidence suggests that a seven -day recall can perform as well as a diary in capturing food expenditures and their variability. Recall periods that exceed 14 days are adversely affected by significant memory decay, while diary fatigue already appears to be significant after the first week. Regardless of how accurately they capture mean consumption, surveys based on short recall periods (\"snapshots\") always overestimate the variability in hab itual consumption. 51 For individual food items, short recall periods (such as a seven -day recall) are affected on the one hand by underestimation of the incidence of consumption, particularly for infrequently consumed items , and on the other by overestimati on of the value of consumption (conditional on positive consumption) because of telescoping error. The recall error appears to be larger for less -frequently consumed items and on short recall periods. The \"usual month\" consumption was designed to deal with the conflict between a long reference period (to get \"typical\" living standards) and a short recall period for feasible interviewing. However, it has not worked as expected because \"usual month\" consumption results tend to overestimate the incidence of co nsumption, particularly for infrequently consumed items, and underestimate consumption values for staples. Importantly, the \"usual month\" approach also imposes a significantly higher burden on the respondent and results in longer interviews. Bounding the recall period with an earlier visit and asking a household to recall their consumption since the last visit of the enumerator is a possible option for improving the quality of recall data. The evidence on the effectiveness of bounding is limited. As this a pproach requires an additional visit to the household, it is a costlier method. Accordingly, it cannot be recommended until more research is performed to evaluate its benefits. Another approach gaining ground recently is to complement seven -day consumption recall with data on the last purchase in the past 30 days. The purpose of th at approach is to better capture the unit values of purchased food items. More methodological work is needed to assess the performance of th ose approaches. Recommendations The fo llowing recommendations are provided for the choice of methods in capturing food consumption in HCES surveys: Low-income countries are advised to adopt recall interviews and a seven -day recall period, as this method provides the best balance between accur acy and cost -effectiveness. Any survey using diary methods must be closely supervised to ensure proper and consistent completion, especially in areas where illiteracy rates are high. The reference period should not exceed 14 days. Detailed metadata on how the diary was administered and supervised should be distributed with the primary survey data. The \"usual month\" approach should not be used. Any change in the recall period or method (recall versus diary) should be accompanied by an experimental compone nt aimed at assessing the impact of the change in survey estimates, which would allow for the reconciliation of estimates before and after the change in methodology. The studies by Backiny -Yetna, Steele , and Yacoubou (2017) and Beegle et al. (2012) provide examples on how this can be done in practice. 52 3.2. Seasonality, number of visits Summary Food consumption and expenditure can show systematic variation related to the time of the year, month or week, as well as for agricultural seasons, holidays, and festivals. Such seasonal patterns need to be considered in survey design and analysis, as they are possible sources of significant bias and measurement error. A survey that only captures food consumption or expenditure data in one period of the year misses seasonal variation s and is not likely to be representative of habitual consumption throughout the year. Many surveys collect data using one visit per household, concentrated over three to four months of fieldwork (48 percent of the surveys assessed by Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat , 2014). Th at approach cannot capture seasonality effects and is, therefore, not recommended. If it is adopted, to ensure that the timing of each round does not affect comparability in the estimates from one year to t he other, maintaining maintain consistency in the timing of the fieldwork is imperative. It should be noted, however, that even th at provision may not be enough to ensure comparability over time as seasonal weather patterns and dates of some important festivities affecting consumption events, such the dat es of Ramadan may change from year to year. One possible way to capture seasonality may be to implement multiple visits on a subsample of households, but as that approach has not been tested widely, it is not offered as a recommendation. The only way to accurately capture habitual consumption for each household is to survey them multiple times over the year, but this is also the most expensive option and in practice , is difficult to implement. Data coll ection spread over the year, but with only one interview per household (and using a short recall period) results in an accurate estimate of average consumption for the population, but excess variability around the mean (Deaton and Zaidi, 2002; Deaton and G rosh, 2000). Recommendations When interest is in analyzing the habitual consumption of a population through an extended period of time (usually one year), it is recommended that seasonality be taken into account in survey design. The two options to consid er, in order of preference are: Conduct one visit per household, spreading the sample over 12 months of fieldwork. The overall sample should be stratified quarterly (e.g. split the overall sample into 12 monthly subsamples in a manner that allows them to b e aggregated into quarterly, nationally representative subsamples). Conduct two visits per household, when the timing of the visits is scheduled to capture seasonal variations (for instance, the first visit could be during the lean period and the second af ter the main harvest). 53 Countries should carefully consider using more than two visits because of the higher cost and the difficulty in managing teams that are associated with more visits. Implementing more than two visits is not impossible, but in several cases in which it has been attempted, there have been implementation problems. Respondents' burden also increases more than proportionally with each additional visit. Regardless of the approach chosen, care should be exercised to ensure that enumeration i s equally spread throughout the days of the week and the month and change in timing in holidays, festival s, and harvest must be considered. 3.3. Acquisition versus consumption Summary Surveys differ as to whether and how they capture food consumption and acquisition. Typically, household budget surveys focus on collecting data to construct CPIs, and as a consequence, recording food items acquired through market purchases. However, as HCES are increasingly used for poverty and food security analysis, emphasis has shifted towards also collecting data on food items procured through own production, barter, gifts, and payments in kind, which are particularly common in rural areas. Information on own production, barter, gifts, and payments in kind is also important for national accounts statistics mainly because food acquired through those channels are included in the household final consumption. Conforti , Gr\u00fcnberger , and Troubat (2017) classified food data -collection practices in three approaches: (a) Acquisition : Households report food acquired through purchases, own production, and in -kind transfers, while consumption of food is not reported; (b) Combination of acquisition and consumption : Households repor t food acquired through purchases without specifying the amount consumed and report food consumption from own production or in -kind transfers ; and (c) Consumption : Households report food actually consumed, and indicate whether that same food was purchased, own -produced, or received as a transfer. Irrespective of which of the three approaches is adopted by a survey, it is important that information is collected on all the food that becomes available to the household through all the possible means of acquisition. It is also important that the survey objectives are clear on whether the information being collected is on acquisition, consumption , or both . Regarding consumption, clarity is needed on whether surveys refer to food intended for consumption (i.e. including food waste) or food actually consumed , which excludes food waste. In the review by Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat . (2014), issues have emerged related to current practices on the neglect of food received in kind, which were not collected in 14 percent of the surveys (4 percent did not collect information on own -produced food). 54 When combining information on sources of acquisition and consumption, care should be taken to ensure that the question wording does not lead to incompleteness or ambiguity in enumeration. Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat (2014) have found that 38 percent of HCES have issues with the wording of rule out questions, namely ambiguit y on whether acquisition or consumption is being asked. Recommendations All surveys should collect data on all main modes of food acquisition, namely: o Purchases. o Household's own production. o Received in kind. Surveys need to explicitly inquire about i n- kind sources that are otherwise likely to be missed, such as payments for labour and participation in social programs. Those in -kind sources can be aggregated, but care should be taken to avoid duplicating information captured in other sections of the sur vey (e.g. employment and social assistance). If public social assistance transfers are not captured elsewhere then it would be important to disaggregate the data. Surveys should be designed so that it is clear to respondents, enumerators, and data users ex actly what information is requested and reported, whether the information required is on acquisition, or consumption, or both. o In the case of consumption, it should be clear whether the questions concern food intended for consumption (including food waste ) or food actually consumed (net of food waste). o If total amount of food purchased over the recall period is the variable of interest, it is then recommended to add an additional question on the amount consumed out of those purchases to avoid mixing acquis itions from purchases with consumption from own production and in -kind transfers . Surveys should exercise care to avoid possible sources of incomplete or ambiguous enumeration commonly found in current survey practice s. o When using a filter question (30 per cent of surveys assessed by Smith, Dupriez , and Troubat (2015) have a leading or filter question): Avoid leading or filter questions in case s in which respondents are asked first if they consumed a food over a certain recall period instead of details about consumption. A negative response to the first question results in skipping questions on quantities acquired but not consumed during the reca ll period. This leads to systematic underestimation of the quantities or expenditure of food acquired. Avoid filter questions that focus on food purchases. This leads to underestimation of mean food acquisition for the population by failing to account for 55 food acquired through own production or in -kind transfers. o For consumption from own production, the question must be worded to clearly indicate food consumed from own production rather than all food harvested . When this distinction is not made , the quanti ties or expenditure reported may include food entering the households' production stocks - not for immediate consumption - and as a result , food consumed from home production is systematically overestimated. 3.4. Meal participation Summary Household surveys collect information on the total amount of food to be consumed by a household over a certain reference period. To convert this information to a per capita basis and to conduct an analysis of the adequacy of food consumption and nutrient intake, it is impor tant to know exactly how many people (partakers) consumed the total amount of food reported by the household. For food and nutrition security analyses, it is also useful to collect data on the physiological status of the partakers (e.g. pregnant or lactati ng status for women) , as that affects nutrition requirements. Furthermore, food may be shared with non - household members, or household members may not be in the household when the food is consumed. Neglecting th ose occurrences adds measurement error to the distribution of per capita food consumption. There are two main approaches to adjust household per capita consumption for the number of partakers. The first approach entails counting the number of people who shared the household's meals and then dividing the total household consumption by t he number. That approach, however, is not very precise , as it is not easy to account for situations in which people participate only in some meals per day, such as employees. The second approach involves counting the num ber of meals taken by each household member and non -household members over the reference period for which food data are collected. It is more precise , but it is also more difficult to implement. As v ery little methodological work has been carried out to fo rmally test the cost and benefits of adopting competing options for accounting for partakers , this is an area to focus on in future research. The recommendations provided below , therefore, are also somewhat more generic than those provided for other areas of survey design. Recommendations It is recommended that all HCES should consider adding an individual household member -based meal module. As collecting information on individuals is expensive and difficult, this c an be implemented as part of the module collecting information on food away from home (see below). On the other hand , practitioners should realize that adding an individual household member -based 56 meal module would make it possible to eliminate other questions that are commonly used in sur veys.39 If an individual member -based meal module cannot be adopted, a less preferred alternative, would be to collect the following information at the household level through a proxy respondent: How many meals does [NAME] usually take in a day? How many d ays in the past X days was [NAME] present in the household? How many meals during the past X days, did [NAME] purchase or receive, and eat away from home? How many meals during the past X days, did [NAME] eat at home? Does [NAME] get meals at school? How m any meals were served to non -household members during the last X days? Did the household host a ceremony, party or festival in the past X days, during which a large number of meals (not just snacks) were served to non-household members? If \"yes\": How many attended? During the last X days, were there non -household members who stayed one or more nights in the household as a guest? If \"yes\": How many nights did they stay? How many meals were they (summed together) served during their stay? How many of the gues ts were children <15 years old? How many adults 16 and older? During the last X days, were any meals served to non -household members? (Other than those served guests who stayed overnight.) 3.5. Food away from home Summary Rapid urbanization and economic growth are typically associated with an increase in the consumption of food away from home in absolute terms and as a share of calories and food expenditure. Implementing traditional HCES questionnaires that are focused on h ousehold food consumption at home has the risk of underestimating food away from home by missing the increasing effect on the proportion of calories and expenditure through changes in food systems . Food away from home consumption is particularly important because food consumed outside the home tends to be more calorie -dense and less nutrient -dense than food consumed at home. The increase in the amount of food consumed away from tends to rise with increases in income. Failing to account for food away from h ome has been shown to affect measures of poverty and inequality, including inequality in the distribution of dietary 39 This includes questions such as \"How many meals are usually taken per day in your household ?\", \"How many days in the past X days was [NAME] present in the household?\", \"Did [NAME] eat meals in this household in the last X days?\", \"Does [NAME] get meals at school?\", \"Did [NAME] consume any meals/snacks/drinks outside the household in the past X d ays?\". The information collected in these questions would now be captured in an individual level module. 57 energy consumption. There is a variety of sources for attaining food away from home, including, among them, restaurants, schools, places of work , and street vendors. Survey design needs to be able to account for all of them , as they can be of varying importance to different groups in the population. Failing to account for food away from home affects not only the mean , but also the distribution of the indicators of interest. An additional challenge is that while the \"main food preparer\" can be expected to be reasonably informed about food at home, it is much more difficult for that person to respond to questions on foo d away from home, as they relate mostly to meal events taking place out of his or her sight. Proxy respondents may be able to report on which household members consumed which meals away from the households, but they are unlikely to be informed about the co st or content of those meals. Such information can only be reliably collected through individual interviews. Recommendations Data collection on food away from home should preferably be done at the individual level, asking the questions separately for eac h individual. For all individuals who report having consumed meals outside the home, the minimum information attained should be on the value of the meals by meal event (breakfast, lunch, dinner , and snacks). While more research on this topic is urgently ne eded, based on current knowledge, the following guidelines are suggested for the design and implementation of a survey module for the measurement of consumption of food away from home in recall surveys: The practice of collecting food away from home infor mation with just one question should be discontinued. The importance of food away from home warrants the design of a separate module, based on a clear definition of food away from home. In particular, surveys should be clear in identifying how to collect information on potentially ambiguous categories of food: \"food prepared at home and consumed outside\" and \"food prepared outside and consumed at home .\" The latter can be integrated into the food at home module (e.g. takeout food) provided that it is made c lear to enumerators, respondents and data users that this is the case. Data collection should be organized around meal events, including snacks and drinks. At a minimum, surveys should collect information on the value of all meals consumed during a meal ev ent away from home (breakfast, lunch, dinner, solid snacks or drinks). The meal events list should be adapted to the local context. Considerations regarding the feasibility, costs, and accuracy should inform the determination of which option to choose between individual module s and the proxy respondent. Food away from home is best collected though individual -level interviews of adults. A proxy respondent can be u sed to report on children's meals away from home and other adults. Possible variations include: 1. Proxy respondents (i.e. a household level module) can be used to report on the number of individuals who consumed meals 58 away (as in block 4 of the sixty -eighth round of the India Survey). Detailed information on the meals , such as cost and meal content , should be collected directly from the relevant household member , including possibly on a targeted, carefully designed subsample. 2. Total expenditure on food away from home can be collected at the household level using a daily food away from home record sheet provided to a trained proxy respondent. Surveys should identify the most frequent place of consumption for each meal event, such as restaurants, street vendors , work , or schools, adapting the place of consumption categories to the local context. Surveys should use the same reference period for food away from home as what is used in the food consumed at home module. The data to estimate food away from home -relate d nutrient content, when feasible, should come from other data sources integrated to the HCES, such as a survey of food establishments ( Farf\u00e1n, Genoni, and Vakis, 2017) or administrative data on the content of public meals, such as those given by schools a nd social programs. 3.6. List of food items Summary The following basic principles should inform the design of the HCES list of food items: The number of food items should balance the lower memory lapses, costs , and interview time associated with short lists, with the better recall and more comprehensive reporting associated with the longer list. Food items representing the large majority of food expenditur e, including nutrient -rich food items , should be include d on the list . The description of the food items must be explicit enough to match only one entry in the reference food composition table. Each food item must be exclusive , each food group should be represented and each food item should belong to only one food group). Adoption of a food classification system may help in meeting th ose criteria. Although the adoption of a standard classification system may involve some challenges given the country specificity of the diet, such a classification is recommended as it allows survey harmonization in terms of methodology, analysis and findi ngs. For many of the basic purposes of HCES, such as for the computation of CPI or for input into national account systems, by far , the most widely adopted standard classification is COICOP. Harmonization eases cross - survey comparability, ensures international comparability of inflation and purchasing power parities, and allows for the assessment of the comprehensiveness of the food l ists. 59 For surveys that are not intended to be used for the calculat ion of CPI calculation or for national accounts, COICOP list may be too extensive. There is a widely acknowledge trade -off in the number of items to be included in a food list. Aggregated i tem lists (usually about 15 items) provide lower estimates than more detailed item lists. On the other hand, a too detailed list of items might have a negative effect, increasing enumerator and respondent fatigue. A universally valid solution does not exis t because the optimal quantity of items strongly depends on regional food consumption habits. Accordingly, a food list must be country specific, representative of the dietary and consumption habits of all segments of a population, and capture evolving tren ds in dietary patterns. Useful information about the frequency and importance of each food item's dietary and expenditure patterns can be drawn from previous HCES or dietary survey data carried out in a given country. As noted, food lists will inevitably be country -specific. Even so, some rules -of- thumb or general guiding principles can be identified to help survey designers determine food lists to capture food consumption and expenditure information that is disaggregated in a way that can be useful for di etary quality analysis. Involving nutritionists in the design of the food lists can ensure that their data needs are properly taken into account. Fiedler and Mwangi (2016) suggest that to meet all of those requirement s, in most cases a list of 100 to 125 i tems is needed. Many experts agree with th at view, but it can only be seen as an indicative rule of thumb. Recommendations Different classifications can be used to harmonize data and foster comparability across surveys. These guidelines encourage survey d esigners to use the COICOP system, as it is currently the basis of classification used in a wide number of datasets, in line with the requirement s specified in the System of National Accounts 2008. Food COICOP classifications are mainly structured using th e basic food groups described in Table 4 .40 Additional regional or global food lists that can inform the development of a survey food list include the FoodEx241 classification , which is being tested in Asian countries (European Food Safety Authority, 2014). 40 See http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=5 for the detailed list of all COICOP categories. See also the revisions discussed at the forty -ninth session of the United Nation Statistics Commission, which was held in New York, 6 -9 March 2018 (Technical Subgroup for the Revision of COICOP (2018)). 41 See https://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/en -804 for more details on FoddEx2 classification . 60 Table 4 Basic Food Groups for COICOP classifications Basic food group Food items in each group Bread and cereals Rice Other cereals, flour , and other products Bread Other bakery products Pasta products Meat Beef and veal Pork Lamb, mutton, and goat Poultry Other meats and meat preparations Fish and seafood Fresh, chilled, or frozen fish and seafood Preserved or processed fish and seafood Milk, cheese , and eggs Fresh milk Preserved milk and other milk products Cheeses Eggs and egg -based products Oils and fats Butter and margarine Other edible oils and fats Fruit Fresh or chilled fruits Frozen, preserved, or processed fruit and fruit -based products Vegetables Fresh or chilled vegetables other than potatoes Fresh or chilled potatoes and other tubers Frozen, preserved , or processed vegetables and vegetable - based products Sugar, jam, honey, chocolate , and confectionery Sugar Jams, marmalades, and honey Confectionery, chocolate, and ice cream Food products not elsewher e classified Salt, spices, condiments Dessert preparations, soups , and broths Baby food and dietary preparations Non-alcoholic beverages Coffee, tea , and cocoa Mineral waters, soft drinks, fruit and vegetable juices Alcoholic beverages Spirits Wine Beer Stimulants Catering services Restaurants, caf\u00e9s , and others Canteens Data should be collected on all of the types of foods and beverages that make up the country's human diet. Lists should be kept up to date to take into account changing dietary habits , while keeping in mind that that products that account for minimal budget shares can have particular nutritional values. A list of general principles that can guide the design of a food list includes the following criteria: 61 The presence of foods from all the main food groups (e.g. the 16-food group classification on which the Household Dietary Diversity Score is based (Kennedy, Ballard , and Dop, 2011). An adequate representation of processed foods (with all the degree of processing from highly processed t o moderately processed). The inclusion of only foods and no other commodities (principle of \"food exclusivity\"; e.g. the food list should not include an item composed by food and non -food items, such as \"alcohol and tobacco\". The list needs to include a reasonable number of individual items (the most common ones) for each of the main food groups. An \"other\" category should be added when relevant (e.g. \"other fruits\" or \"other vegetables\") to record the acquisition or consumption of additional food items. It is important that such categories remain marginal as quantities cannot be collected under those categories and food matching is imperfect. Food items (other than prepared dishes) should not span multiple food groups (e.g. avoid \"eggs or milk products\" as one group). Only group food items with similar nutritional properties in one question (e.g. avoid \"Mineral water or soft drinks\"). Avoid gro uping different status of the same food item with different nutritional properties (e.g. fresh or dried fish, fresh or dried milk). Avoid broad categories that do not allow identifying the type of food, such as \" snacks\", \" canned foods\" and \"baby food .\" Food items that are the object of product -specific government - subsidized programs should be listed individually on the food list. Foods that are fortified or have the potential to be the vehicle of food fortification program s (e.g. iodized salt, fortified flour or cooking oil) should be listed individually in the food list. Micronutrient (e.g. vitamin -A or iron) rich foods, such as sweet potatoes and liver should be listed individually. Food lists can be built from national food composition tables or databases to ease later food matching. Because of the importance of having good and updated food composition tables or databases, it is also recommended that countries invest in the update or development of country or regional food composition tables. 62 3.7. Non-standard units of measurement Summary To date, there is no standard methodology applied to the collection of food quantities in cases in which respondents (and enumerators) are less familiar with standard measurement units. Common practice has been either to require households to report everything in standard units, or for enumerators to estimate the standard unit conversions on an ad hoc basis. Both approaches are problematic and lead to inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the data reported. Several national statistical offices maintain a library of conversion factors for local units, but they are often incomplete, not updated, and tend not to be consistently implemented. Units of measurement are critical for many aspects of data collection and quality assurance. Qualitative feedback from field practitioners, and extensive feedback from initial piloting of those methods, suggest that allowing non -standard units of measurement can increase the accuracy of reported quantities, primarily by reducing respond ent burden. To properly benefit from allowing non -standard units options, reporting must be paired with a framework for consistently converting non -standard units into standard units, based on reliably documented conversion factors. As conversion factors t ypically involve weighing and measuring, which are some of the activities carried out in price surveys - at least for unpackaged foods, such as root crops and vegetables - the treatment of non -standard units should also be covered in guidelines for price s urveys. Recommendations The decision on whether to allow the use of non -standard units of measurement should be addressed during the design phase. By d oing this, the tendency for units of measurement to be determined on an ad hoc or inconsistent basis du ring fieldwork is reduced . Though non -standard units are used around the world (in countries of all income levels) the cost -benefit ratio of incorporating them into each survey should be evaluated, focusing particularly on their prevalence of use. If need ed, conduct a pilot survey to determine the extent to which respondents need non -standard units - extensively, minimally, or not at all. When feasible, allow households to report in both standard and non - standard units of measure based on w hat they are mos t familiar with for each item reported. If avoiding formal use of non -standard unit still leads to ad hoc field conversions, then even a rather limited set of non - standard units with less of an implementation burden, may still be worthwhile. 63 It is critica l to establish (define or collect) conversion factors for all non-standard units that are to be used. Additional features to improve the accuracy of reported non -standard units quantities , such as market surveys to establish accurate non -standard units and conversion factors, photo reference aides, and on -the-spot value verification using computer -assisted personal interviews, may also be considered. National statistical offices and implementation partners should work together to establish non -standard un its databases that can be used across surveys, effectively increasing the standardization of the units, while also limiting the cost to implement them. To this end, survey implementers should thoroughly document all non -standard units protocols and related conversion factors and make them publicly available . 75 4.Bibliography Ahmed, N., Brzozowski, M. & Crossley, T.F. 2006.

Introduction Most countries in the world periodically collect data on household consumption or expenditure through sample surveys. Household budget surveys (HBS) and household income and expenditure surveys (HIES) are conducted primarily to provide input to the calculation of consumer price indices (CPI) or the compilation of national accounts. In developing countries, national-ly-representative data on household consumption or expenditures are also obtained from various types of socio-economic or living standards surveys conducted to measure and monitor poverty or provide data for in-forming poverty reduction policies. This report refers to this diverse set of surveys as household consumption and expenditure surveys (HCES). Increasingly, statistical agencies that implement HCES disseminate the survey microdata. When well documented HCES microdata are made easily acces - sible, they are extensively used by secondary analysts, often for purposes other than the ones pursued by the primary investigators. This re-purposing of data offers the potential to add much value to datasets, as it ex-tends and diversifies the uses of the data at no cost to the data producer. Feedback provided by an enlarged community of analysts can help data producers in-crease the reliability and relevance of their surveys. Considering this growing and diverse community of users, the issue of data quality takes on a new di-mension. Survey design and methods differ consider-ably across countries--and sometimes over time within countries. To what extent do HCES provide reliable and relevant data for both their traditional purposes and for new, additional ones? And if quality issues are identified, how can they be addressed to better meet the needs of users? Data collection is expensive, and puts a high burden on respondents. It is the duty of statistical agencies that implement such surveys to maximize the return on their investments by making data as reliable and relevant as possible. And it is the role of the inter-national statistical community to contribute to the de - velopment of guidelines and recommendations to sup - port the improvement of these surveys. Under the auspices of the International Household Survey Network (IHSN), the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) undertook a large-scale assessment of HCES conducted in low and middle income countries. This project had two key objectives. The first was to devel - op a method to assess the reliability and relevance of food consumption data as collected through HCES. The second one was to implement this method to conduct a large-scale assessment and report on the relevance and reliability of the data contained in a large number of surveys to identify opportunities for improvements. The first step in developing the assessment consisted of identifying the main categories of uses and users of household food consumption data: poverty analysts, national accountants and CPI compilers, food security experts, planners of food-based nutrition interventions such food fortification programs, and the private sec - tor. The next step was to define the criteria for assessing reliability and relevance of the data for each user. An assessment form was then developed, which was used to compile information on the design of food consump-tion or expenditure survey modules from 100 coun-tries. The reliability and relevance of each survey's food consumption (or expenditure) module(s) were then assessed using this meta-database. Reliability refers to the capacity of the survey to provide a \"true\" or \"accu-rate\" measure of household consumption or expendi - tures. Relevance refers to the fitness of the survey data for a specific purpose. The assessment is based purely on a review of survey questionnaires and related documentation. Clearly, the reliability and relevance of survey data also depends on the quality of the sample frame and sampling design, training and supervision of interviewers, the data entry and editing work, and the collaboration of respondents. These factors are however not covered in this study. Also, the assessment is limited to food consumption, although all HCES cover a broader spectrum of goods and services. The reason for focusing on this subcom-ponent of household consumption is that many of the newer users are primarily interested in the food data. Further, global forces are leading to changes in dietary patterns that raise new reliability and relevance issues specifically related to food. Another assessment, cover-ing non-food household expenditures, is being under-taken separately by the World Bank and IHSN, with different partners. The report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 pro- vides an overview of the key uses and users of HCES food consumption data. Chapters 3 and 4 report re-spectively on the reliability and relevance of 100 survey questionnaires reviewed with respect to the needs of the uses and users identified in Chapter 2. Conclusions and recommendations are formulated in Chapter 5. Assessment of the Reliability and Revelance of the Food Data Collected in National Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey 103. Assessment of the reliabil - ity of the food data In this chapter, the ba-sic reliability of the food data collected in current national HCES's is as-sessed. \"Reliability\" is defined here as the de - gree to which a survey collects data on the ac-tual or \"true\" food con-sumption and/or expen - ditures of households in a country's population. The assessment is based on the most recent HCES from each devel - oping country for which sufficient documenta-tion with which to con-duct the assessment was available to us. Only na-tionally representative surveys are included in the as-sessment. The final set of 100 surveys thus represents a sample of recent, sufficiently-documented, nationally-representative surveys conducted in developing coun-tries. Appendixes 1 and 2 contain respectively a detailed account of the implementation of the assessment and a list of the surveys. The design of HCES surveys needs to meet certain criteria for the data to provide the reliability required by the data user. Meeting these minimum criteria, and thus ensuring that the data collected are reasonably accurate, is a concern of all us-ers of the food data in HCES's, from national accounts statisti-cians to planners of nutrition interventions.Figure 1 reports the regional breakdown and years of data collection of the surveys. The highest number (40) is from Sub-Saharan Africa, and the lowest (5) from the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA). Overall, 70 percent of the developing countries are represented, with South Asia having the highest representation\u2014all eight of its countries\u2014and MENA the lowest. 15 The ear- liest year of data collection for a survey is 1993 (Guinea-Bissau), and the latest is 2012 (Vanuatu). The majority of the surveys were administered between 2005 and 2009. An attempt was made to identify clear, quantita- tive cut offs for defining assessment criteria in order to avoid ambiguity and maintain objectivity. While these cut-offs are in many cases by necessity based on intui-tive judgments rather than scientific evidence, they are intended to serve as a point of reference for prioritiz-ing areas in need of improvement and for tracking re-liability and relevance across countries and over time. In future studies it will be useful to conduct sensitiv-ity analyses to determine the robustness of the cut-offs with respect to accurate measurement of indicators of interest. 15 Sub-Saharan Africa is represented by 85% of its countries, East Asia and the Pacific by 54%, Middle East and North Africa by 39%, Europe and Central Asia by 78%, and Latin America and the Caribbean by 55%. World Bank country and lending groups are used for regional classifications (World Bank 2012).0102030405060 40 Sub-Saharan Africa13 South Asia5.0 East Asia and the Pacific5 Europe and Central Asia18 Latin America and the Caribbean83058 516 7 Middle East and North Africa 2000-2004 Before 2000 2010 and later 2005-2009 IHSN Working Paper No. 008 February 2014 11The assessment is based on seven areas of investiga- tion: Recall period for at-home food data collection; Modes of food acquisition included (food purchases, food consumed from own production, and food received in kind); Completeness of enumeration of either food acquisition or food consumption; Comprehensiveness of the at-home food list; Specificity of the at-home food list; Quality of data collected on food consumed away from home; Whether seasonality in food consumption patterns is taken into account; and For each area, a set of minimum criteria for basic reliability is established and then tested using the data collected on the country assessment forms. Meeting these criteria, and thus ensuring that the data collected are reasonably accurate, is a concern of all users of the food data in HCES's, from national accounts statisti - cians to planners of nutrition interventions. It should be emphasized that the criteria set here are minimum criteria, and even when met, many leave ample room for improvement. The following methodological issues are also dis- cussed in the chapter: Whether metric (or other standard) quantities of foods consumed are provided. Calculation of calorie consumption; Calculation of edible portions and the nutrient content of foods ; Calculation of per-capita indicators and nutrient insufficiencies and the importance of collecting data on the number of food partakers; and Use of acquisition data to measure consumption. 3.1 Recall period for at-home food data collection A wide variety of recall periods are used in national surveys, ranging from 1 to 365 days. The pros and cons of each are discussed, and a minimum standard of two weeks or less proposed for HCES data to be considered reliable. Using this benchmark, for 70 percent of the assessment surveys the data collected can be considered reliable with respect to the recall period.The recall period for food data collection is the amount of time over which respondents are asked to remem-ber their food acquisitions and/or consumption. 16 The longer the recall period, the more difficult it is for re-spondents to make accurate reports. A recall period that is too long leads to \"recall error\" in which true acquisition or consumption is under reported. On the other hand, the shorter the recall period the more likely a respondent is to include events that occurred before the recall period. Such \"telescoping error\" leads to over-reporting. 17 The relatively high frequency and small size of food (versus non-food) acquisitions/consump-tion means that recall error and thus under-reporting is believed to be more of an issue than telescoping error (Deaton and Grosh 2000). There is no obvious or commonly agreed-upon num- ber of days that a recall period should be for reliable measurement. A recall period of no more than two weeks, however, is within minimally safe limits, as con-firmed by studies showing considerably lower expendi - ture estimates when 30 days (or one month), which is the next highest recall period in use, is employed. 18 In this assessment, two-weeks will therefore be considered the longest recall period to obtain reliable data. A one-week period may have an advantage over two weeks in that it is easier for respondents to remember what happened since the same day last week (for example, Monday). The day of the week can help set up a specific \"memory post\" at the beginning of the recall period in respondents' minds, bounding the period. 19 The exact point in time two weeks prior to the day a survey is ad-ministered is likely to be more fuzzy, although a pre-liminary visit two weeks before the interview can help. Among the 100 surveys included in the assessment, 33 percent employed multiple recall periods. The peri- 16 The survey's recall period should be distinguished from its \"reference period\". The latter is the total amount of time for which respondents are asked to report their food acquisitions or consumption. The only circumstance under which the recall and reference periods differ is when households are interviewed more than one time in consecutive visits. For example, households may be visited four times to ask about their food acquisitions in the last seven days, giving a recall period of seven days and a reference period of 28 days. 17 Beegle et al. (2012) provide a review of the literature on the influence of the recall period on expenditure estimates as well as recent evidence from an experiment undertaken in Tanzania. 18 For a commonly-cited example, see the description of an experiment undertaken using India's HCES in Gibson (2005). 19 A visit a week before the interview (as has been implemented in many Living Standards Measurement Study surveys) in which preliminary data are collected, helps to set this memory post. Assessment of the Reliability and Revelance of the Food Data Collected in National Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey 12od can vary by population (e.g., different for urban and rural areas), by source of acquisition (e.g., purchases versus home produced food), and/or by type of food. In these cases, for the purposes of judging reliability the maximum recall period employed is considered. For example, if the recall period for food purchases is seven days but for home-produced food consumed it is one month, then one month is used. In a few cases multiple recall periods were employed for all foods for which data are collected, a design implemented for research purposes. For these surveys, reliability is assessed us-ing the minimum recall period. For example, if data were collected using both a seven-day and one-month recall period for all foods then seven days is used for this assessment. The recall period is considered to be one day for diary surveys. 20 Figure 2 reports on the percent of assessment surveys employing various recall periods. The most common is less than one week, utilized by 41 percent of countries. Among these surveys, the most common recall period is one-day, because the large majority use the diary method. Nearly one-quarter of the countries used recall periods of one-week, five percent used two weeks, 21 and seven percent used one month. A full 30 percent of the assess - ment surveys employed recall pe - riods greater than two weeks.22 One-third of the surveys that did not meet the minimum reliabil-ity criterion employed a 365-day recall period in the context of the \"usual month\" approach. Here respondents are asked to recall their food acquisitions and/or consumption for 20 In some cases the diaries of households without a literate member are completed by interviewers for time periods greater than one day. While as part of this assessment an attempt was made to collect information on how long this period was and for what percent of households, in most cases the information was not available in the survey documentation. 21 Some of the \"two-week\" recall surveys actually had 15-day periods, presumably to represent half a month. 22 Four of these surveys had an undefined recall period which could potentially extend beyond two weeks, because respondents were either asked to report on the expenditures/quantities the \"last time\" a food was acquired or to simply report on how often a food was acquired, with options being daily, weekly, monthly or yearly and the usual expenditure/quantity each time.a typical month in the last year.23 While this method has the intended advantage of obtaining estimates of usual consumption specific to each household rather than only for population groups, the length of the pe - riod over which respondents are asked to recall is un-reasonably long for accurate estimation. 24 Overall, the percent of the assessment surveys for which the data collected can be considered reliable with respect to the recall period used is 70. It should be kept in mind that all of the diary surveys, having a one-day recall period, meet the criterion. Traditionally HCES were designed to collect data on food acquired for consumption rather than food con-sumed itself, thus the titles \"Household Expenditure Survey\" or \"Household Budget Survey\" (United Na- tions 1989). Today, more than half collect data on food consumed, whether in conjunction with food acquired or alone (see Section 3.3). Collecting food consumption data through HCES survey instruments poses new is-sues for reliability with respect to the recall period for data collection because of the additional cognitive bur- 23 Two of the assessment countries employed a \"usual week\" approach, one with a recall period of six months and another with a recall period of one year. 24 For recent evidence, Beegle et al. (2011) find that usual month food expenditure estimates for a sample of households in Tanzania are considerably lower than those from a 7-day recall. The authors point out that this difference is partially due to the more difficult cognitive burden required for reporting usual month information. 0102030405060708090100 41.0 Less than one week24.0 One week5.0 Two weeks23.0 Greater than one week70.0 Less than or equal to two weeks7.0 One mont h Note: N=100 survey s IHSN Working Paper No. 008 February 2014 13den of remembering the behaviors of more people (in fact, all household members since, hopefully, all house - hold members eat, versus only the food acquirers) and more events (eating occasions versus food acquisition occasions). Further, in the case of interview surveys, re-spondents must remember the wide mix of foods that can be combined into prepared dishes, the latter which are likely to be the focus of respondents' memory, rath-er than food-specific ingredients as they are acquired (Smith and Subandoro 2006). The nutritional science literature on the collection of food consumption data recommends a recall period of no more than 24 hours 25 yet, as seen in this section, the majority of surveys (near 60 percent) use a longer recall period. The reliability of the consumption data collected for these longer recall periods must be the subject of future research. 3.2 Modes of acquisition for which at- home food data are collected Inclusion of the following three sources from which food can be acquired for at-home consumption is cru-cial for reliable measurement of both food acquisition and consumption using HCES's: (1) Market purchases; 26 (2) Food consumed from households' own production; and (3) Food received in-kind (wages received in kind, social transfers in kind, or gifts). 25 In their guide to measuring food consuming Swindale and Ohri-Vachaspati (2005) write that \"Information on household food consumption should be collected using the previous 24-hour period as a reference (24-hour recall). Lengthening the recall period beyond this time often results in significant error due to faulty recall\" (p. 4). Ferro-Luzzi (2003) concurs that \"The 24-hour recall method relies on the subject's capacity to remember what they have eaten. As memory declines rapidly beyond one day, the recall method usually retrieves information only on the previous day's consumption\" (p. 105). 26 Barter is sometimes included as a fourth source (e.g., United Nations 2009). However most surveys do not collect data on barter separately, instead considering it part of purchases.For many users, it is important that information on the main possible modes of food acquisition (purchases, own produc - tion, in-kind receipts) be collected in HCES. Overall most sur - veys comply with this requirement, with the most problematic being in-kind receipt, which are not collected in 14 percent of the surveys reviewed for the assessment. In some cases sur - veys do not allow specifying multiple sources for each food item, which is a problem for some uses.Obtaining food through market purchases is now widespread throughout the world and is the prominent form of food acquisition in many locations, especially urban areas. In many countries, a considerable share of households obtain some of their food from their own production, whether from crop fields, home gardens, or orchards. This category also includes wild food gath-ered and consumed, fish and seafood fished or gath-ered, and the consumption of the meat of domestic ani-mals reared by households. It is also quite common for households, especially developing-country households, to obtain some of their food in kind, whether in the form of gifts from other households, payments from an em-ployer, or public or private assistance. For the purposes of this assessment, the food data collected in a survey is considered to be unreliable if any of these three sources is excluded from data collection. Figure 3 shows the percentage of assessment surveys for which data were collected for each source, as well as for all three sources. 27 All of the assessment surveys collected data on food purchases. Almost all surveys also collected data on food consumed from own pro-duction, with just four exceptions. The only source for which a noticeable percent of countries did not collect data (14 percent) is in-kind receipts of food. Overall, 85 percent of countries collected data on all three sources, leaving 15 percent not meeting the minimum reliability criteria in this area. For some types of analysis, such as calculating CPIs, it is important that data be collected individually on the three food sources. The assessment found that for many surveys the data were collected in such a way that the quantities and/or expenditures on foods obtained from the three sources could not be distinguished. This was the case for 13 of the 84 surveys for which data were col-lected on all of the three sources. In some cases respon-dents were asked to report on consumption of home-produced food and in-kind receipts combined, with no distinction made between the two. In others, respon-dents were asked to specify only one single source for the food item acquired or consumed, with no allowance for acquisition from more than one source, thus effec - tively ruling out accurate enumeration by source. In still other surveys, respondents were asked to identify the source of acquisition but could choose a combined source, such as \"both purchased and home produced\", again ruling out individual enumeration. Finally, two 27 The analysis for this section could be undertaken only for 98 of the assessment countries. For the remaining two it was not possible to determine whether the three sources were included in the data collection from the available documentation. Assessment of the Reliability and Revelance of the Food Data Collected in National Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey 14surveys gathered information on consumption by asking about con-sumption from purchases, home-produced food and food received in kind over the recall period (the usual sources), but also from \"own stock,\" which includes all food ac-quired before the recall period. Therefore it is not possible to break down the consumption that came from the three sources separately. Note that for surveys collecting data individually on in-kind food received, very few enumerated all of the various sources separately so as to obtain a full accounting. Data were collected specifically and in-dividually on \"gifts\" for 62 percent of countries for which in-kind food received was enumerated individu-ally, on in-kind payments from employers for 25 per-cent of countries, and on food assistance received for 21 percent. Four surveys from Latin America and the Caribbean collected data on food received from house - holds' own businesses. For countries where any of these sources are important modes of acquisition, their ex-clusion could lead to substantial under-reporting. 3.3 Completeness of enumeration of foods acquired or consumed As noted in the introduction, modern HCES's intend to collect data on either the foods acquired by house - holds for consumption or directly on foods consumed. Among the assessment surveys, 41 percent collected data solely on food acquisition, 26 percent solely on food consumption, and the remaining 33 percent on It is important for the analyst to have clarity on whether sur - veys are collecting data on food acquisition, consumption, or both, and for the survey to collect data according to the stated goal. Only the food intended for consumption or consumed must be included and not additional food (e.g. by not mistak - ing agricultural produce harvested for consumption.) The as-sessment found 25 percent of the surveys to be problematic in some respect, all of them being interview surveys (diaries appear to be immune by problems in this domain).both (see Table 1).28 Food acquisition data were more likely to be collected as part of diary surveys than in-terview surveys, whether exclusively or in conjunction with food consumption data. For the food data in HCES to be reliably collected, a full accounting of all acquired food intended for con-sumption or that was consumed over the recall period must take place. Additionally, only the food intended for consumption or consumed must be included and not additional food. The following exclusion and in-clusion accounting errors can plague the collection of HCES food data: (1) Acquisition surveys: Rule-out leading question on consumption . If a leading or \"filter\" question on consumption of each food item over the recall period is answered \"no,\" it rules out collection of further data on the acquisition of the food. In this case, respondents are first asked whether or not they consumed each food item in the food list for a recall period up to a year be-fore the time of the survey. Then they are asked how much was purchased, consumed from own production, and/or received in kind over the survey recall period for food data collection. If the respondent answers \"no\" to the leading question, however, and the leading question recall period is the same (or close to) the recall period 28 The surveys for which acquisition (consumption) data were collected for both food purchases and in-kind receipts were classified as acquisition (consumption) surveys. Those for which both acquisition and consumption data were collected for either food purchases or in-kind receipts, or for which consumption data were collected for purchases and acquisition data for in-kind receipts and vice versa, were classified into the \"both\" category. 0102030405060708090100100.0 Food purchases96.0 Home-produced food three resources Note: N=100 survey s IHSN Working Paper No. 008 February 2014 15for food data collection, her or his household receives a zero for acquisitions of the food item regardless of whether or not it was acquired. This leads to system - atic underestimation of the quantities and/or expendi - tures on food acquired. A rule-out leading question on consumption is considered to be a problem when the two recall periods are less than or equal to two months apart. Note that this issue does not afflict diary surveys because there is no pre-listing of foods to rule out. (2) Acquisition surveys: Rule-out, short-recall-peri - od leading question on acquisition . Here, if answered \"no\", a short-recall-period leading question on acqui-sition of each food item rules out collection of further data collection on the acquisition of the food over the (longer) survey recall period. In this case respondents are first asked whether or not they acquired each food item over the short recall period (e.g., two weeks). Fur-ther information is collected on the acquisitions of the food for the longer recall period for food data collection only for those food items that were acquired over the shorter recall period. This leads to underestimation of mean food acquisition for the population. (3) Acquisition surveys: Rule-out leading question on food purchases. In this case if a respondent reports that the household did not purchase any of one food item, then no further information is collected on that food item. Since home-produced or in-kind receipts of the food are left out, this problem also leads to under-estimation of mean food acquisition for the population.(4) Data collected on food harvested rather than food consumed from home production. When this er- ror occurs, the quantities and/or expenditures on food acquired include those entering into the households' production stocks - not the household pantry for im-mediate consumption - and are systematic overesti-mates of food consumed from home production. (5) Ambiguity about whether to report on acquisi - tion or consumption . The question asked of respon- dents does not make it clear whether they are expected to report on their acquisitions of each food item or con-sumption of each food item over the recall period. This problem could pertain to food purchases, food received in-kind or both (but not home produced food con-sumed) and leads to inaccuracies in calculation of the mean acquisition or consumption for the population as well as measures of inequality. (6) Routine month surveys: Ambiguity about wheth - er respondents should report on the routine month in the recall period or only those months in which any food item is consumed . In many routine month sur- veys respondents are first asked to report on the num-ber of months in the last year in which each food item was consumed. Immediately following, they are asked about the usual or average amount per month. Some questionnaires, however, fail to specify whether or not the average should be for those months in which it was consumed or for any month in the last year. When this type of accounting error occurs, some households may report on the former and some the latter leading to over- or under- estimation of their consumption of any Table 1: Completeness of enumeration of food acquisition and/or food consumption Interview Diary All (percent) Whether acquisition or consumption data are collected Acquisition 36.1 48.7 41.0 Consumption 36.1 10.3 26.0 Both 27.9 41.0 33.0 Problems of incomplete enumeration Rule -out leading question on consumption 13.1 0.0 8.0 Rule -out, short -recall -period leading question on acquisition 3.3 0.0 2.0 Rule -out leading question on food purchases 1.6 0.0 1.0 Own production question refers to food harvested rather than consumed 3.3 0.0 2.0 Ambiguity whether to report on acquisition or consumption 6.6 5.1 6.0 \"Usual month\" surveys: Ambiguity whether to report consumption in any month or months with positive consumption 13.1 0.0 8.0 Percent of surveys with problems of incomplete enumeration 37.7 5.1 25.0 Note: N= 100 surveys. Assessment of the Reliability and Revelance of the Food Data Collected in National Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey 16food item for which a positive number of months was reported for the initial question. As can be seen in Table 1, 11 percent of the assess - ment surveys suffer from the use of the three types of rule-out leading questions. The collection of data on food harvested rather than food consumed from home production is a relatively rare problem from which only two percent of the surveys suffer. A full 14 percent of the surveys had problems of ambiguity in what is to be reported, which likely leads to incomplete enumeration for some households. The problem of ambiguity in ex-pected reporting for routine month surveys was identi - fied in eight percent of the surveys. Overall, 25 percent of the surveys did not meet the reliability criterion for completeness of enumeration, that is, they were af-flicted by some of the identified problems of incomplete enumeration. Note that the large majority of the sur-veys that have these types of accounting problems are interview surveys. 3.4 Comprehensiveness of the at- home food list Equally important for reliable collection of food data in HCES's is that data are collected on all of the types of foods and beverages that make up the modern hu-man diet. This is especially so given that urbanization, globalization and trade openness are leading to con-sumption of a wider variety of foods than in the past when populations tended to rely on foods that could be grown locally. These processes are also leading to greater consumption of processed foods (Popkin, Adair and Ng 2012), defined as \"Any food other than a raw ag-ricultural commodity and includes any raw agricultural commodity that has been subject to processing, such as canning, cooking, freezing, dehydration, or milling\" (USDA 1946). Because the food modules of developing-country household expenditure surveys were originally set up to collect data on the acquisition of individual foods destined for in-home preparation (Smith 2012), this poses a challenge to countries employing the inter-As diets evolve, sometimes, quite rapidly, it is important for survey designers to keep up with the changes by updating the food lists. Benchmarks for reliability in this domain refer to the presence of foods from all the main food groups, an adequate representation of processed foods, and the fact that the list should not include non-food items. Overall, 72 percent of the assessment surveys met the criteria set in these three domains.view method of data collection to continually update their food lists. To judge the comprehensiveness of survey food lists a set of 14 \"basic\" food groups that represent the types of foods making up the contemporary human diet can be used as starting point. The Basic Food Groups (BFGs) are listed in Table 2. Common food items in each group are listed in Appendix 3. Each survey's food list is used to catalogue the number of food items in these groups. For interview surveys, the list is printed directly on the questionnaire. For diary surveys, the actual number of food items recorded by all sample respondents can run into the thousands, far too high for most types of data analyses. In the process of data analysis the detailed recorded items are thus categorized into broader items for inclusion in the actual data set. The food list used for this assessment is this broader list of items, or the \"analytical\" food list, with the rationale that it is what is eventually used for analysis. Even with this shorter food list, the mean number of food items represented in the diary surveys, at 369, is far higher that of the interview surveys, which is 102 (see Table 2), 29 reflecting that fact that the diary method makes it possible to itemize food items much more specifically. Note that the number of food items varies greatly across the assessment surveys, ranging from a low of 19 to a high of 5,407. Figure 4 shows the percent of assessment surveys that include foods in each BFG. At 12 percent, alcoholic beverages are a group that is left out of a significant number of surveys. While alcohol is a sensitive issue in some countries with large Muslim populations, its ex-clusion is not limited to surveys from these countries. Also notable is that the food group \"Eggs\" is not repre-sented in four percent of surveys. 29 The number of food items for the Brazil survey (a diary survey), at 5,407, is far higher than the country with the next lowest number, which is 677. When Brazil is excluded from the calculation, the mean number of food items overall falls to 150 and for the diary surveys to 229.

The first is that all 14 BFGs must be represented by at least one food item. As can be seen in Table 2, just over 80 percent of the assessment surveys meet this criterion. The percentage rises to near 100 among the diary surveys. The second reliability criterion relates to the per- centage of foods that are processed, including prepared dishes. Five of the food groups listed in Table 2 contain only or almost all processed food items: Milk and milk products, oils and fats, sugar, jam, honey, chocolate and sweets, condiments, spices and baking agents, and both beverage groups. On average, these foods alone make up roughly 30 percent of the total foods. A cut-off is imposed: At least 40 percent of food items must be processed as a reliability criterion, which allows for some processed items to be included in the other food groups (e.g., bread and other baked goods in the cereals group). The large majority of the surveys, 87 percent, meet this criterion, indicating that many countries have been updating their HCES food lists over time. The final food list comprehensiveness reliability criterion assessed here is the \"food exclusivity\" of the list, that is, the food list must include only foods and no other commodities. Among the assessment countries, there are only three for which this criterion is not met (with the non-exclusive item being \"alcohol and tobac-Table 2: Comprehensiveness and specificity of the at -home food list Interview surveysDiary surveys All Mean number of food items 102 369 204 Minimum 19 44 19 Maximum 411 5407 5407 Comprehensiveness of the food list (Percent of surveys) All 14 Basic Food Groups are represented 71.7 97.3 81.4 At least 40% of food items are processed 86.7 86.5 86.6 Food items are all food -exclusive 96.7 97.3 96.9 Specificity of the food list (A) Minimum number of food items in each Basic Food Group a/ Cereals (5) 95.0 100.0 96.9 Pulses, nuts 51.7 91.9 Fish and seafood (5) 35.0 89.2 55.7 Milk and milk products (5) 61.7 94.6 74.2 Eggs (1) 93.3 100.0 95.9 Oils and fats (5) 46.7 89.2 62.9 honey, chocolate and sweets (5) 50.0 91.9 66.0 Condiments, spices and baking agents (10) c/ 28.3 70.3 44.3 Non- alcoholic beverages (5) 65.0 97.3 77.3 Alcoholic beverages (5) 35.0 78.4 51.5 (B) Minimum number of food items in at least .... 10 food groups 46.7 89.2 62.9 11 food groups 28.3 86.5 50.5 12 food groups 20.0 70.3 39.2 13 food groups 10.0 54.1 26.8 14 (all) food groups 6.7 37.8 18.6 (C) Less than 5% of food items span the basic food groups 71.7 86.1 77.1 a/ The minimum number of food items for each group is given in parentheses.b/ Includes potatoes.c/ Includes vegetable-based stimulants (e.g., cola nuts).Notes: N=100 for the information presented on the number of food items; N=96 for that presented on comprehensiveness and specificity.

Figure 5 summarizes the percentage of countries meeting the three assessment criteria of comprehen - siveness, and the percentage meeting them all. Overall, 72 percent of the assessment surveys met all three cri-teria. 3.5 Specificity of the at-home food list Specificity of the food list refers to the degree of detail with which food items are classified. For an interview survey, in which foods are pre-listed, the goal is to in-clude a sufficient number of food items to jog respon-dents' memories of what has been acquired and/or con-sumed that is applicable to all households in a popula - tion. This population must include countries' better-off urban households whose members tend to eat a very wide variety of foods in a variety of forms, including raw, processed, prepared and packaged. There is an ac-curacy trade-off involved, however, because very long food lists can quickly lead to respondent and interview-er fatigue (Beegle et al. 2012). One way that surveys can bridge this tradeoff is to list the most common food 30 Kola nuts are a vegetable-based stimulant.There are two main aspects to food list specificity: the list needs to include a reasonable number of individual items for each of the main food groups, and non-processed food items should ideally follow into just one group.items consumed by the population and then include an \"other\" category where the acquisition/consumption of additional food items can be recorded. When they are present, these \"other\" food categories are included in the food list counts for this assessment. To judge the specificity of surveys' food lists, a first step is identifying a minimum number of food items that should be included in each of the 14 BFGs. While these numbers are somewhat arbitrary, they were chosen based on the authors' judg - ment of the typical variety found within each (see Table 2, where the minimum numbers are in pa-rentheses). It ranges from one for \"Eggs\" to ten for \"Vegetables\", \"Fruits\", and \"Condiments, spices and baking agents\". The table re-ports the percentage of assessment surveys meeting these minimums. Almost all surveys meet the mini-mum for the \"Cereals\" food group. Food groups where the minimum is met by notably low percentages of surveys are \"Roots, tubers and plantains\", \"Fish ages\". The food group \"Condiments, spices and baking agents\" is likely underrepresented because it is made up of more modern processed food items. Given the increased importance of these items in people's diets (e.g., Popkin 2002) and budgets, however, especially in urban areas, it is important that they be included in food lists in their appropriate relative variety. This point is underlined by the fact that they have a much higher representation in diary than interview surveys. There are some countries in which specific food groups are more likely to be underrepresented simply because the foods are not consumed widely among their populations. For example, \"Roots, tubers and plantains\" are not consumed in some countries because they cannot be grown there and are not easily imported. Very few distinct items in the \"Fish and seafood\" cate - gory may be appropriate for land-locked countries. Be-cause of these inherent country-specific variations, the first assessment criteria used for judging food specific-ity is that the required minimum number of food items be met for at least 10 of the 14 food groups. Sixty-three percent of countries meet this criterion (see Panel B of Table 2). 010203040506070809010081.4 All basic food groups represented 86.6 At least 40 percent of food items processe d96.9 Food items are all food-exclusive72.2 All three criteria Note: N=96 survey s Assessment of the Reliability and Revelance of the Food Data Collected in National Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey 20The second and last criterion used to judge the speci - ficity of HCES food lists relates to food items that span more than one of the basic food groups. Most prepared dishes will span these food groups because they have multiple ingredients, and this is not considered a prob-lem. Indeed, specificity is increased when these types of food items are listed in detail. A large number of food items (other than prepared dishes) spanning food groups is an indication that a food list is not specific enough for accurate enumeration of food consumption/acquisition, however. In the case of diary surveys, it could be both a reflection of a lack of instruc-tions to diary keepers to be specific about their food consumption/ac-quisition and/or of how food items recorded have been aggregated for analysis. The second specificity criterion is that less than five per-cent of the food items (apart from prepared dishes) span more than one BFG. When this condition is met, the large majority of food items, 95 percent or more, fall into one and only one food group. Note that 93 percent of the as- sessment surveys had a least one food item (not including prepared dishes) that spans more than one of the BFGs. Among those with any, the average percent of such items in the food list ranges from 0.45 to 26 percent. Some span just two food groups. Examples of these are: \"Beverages\" (spanning the Non-alcoholic beverages and Alcoholic beverages groups); \"Butter, margarine and cheese\" (spanning the Milk and milk products and Oils and fats groups) \"Other milk, cheese and eggs\" (spanning the Milk and milk products and Eggs groups) \"Other meats, poultry, seafood\" (Spanning the Meat, poultry and offal and Fish and Seafood groups); and \"Canned fruits or vegetables\" (Spanning the Fruits and Vegetables groups). Others could span a large number of food groups. These include residual \"catch-all\" categories such as \"All other foods\", \"Other food products\", \"Miscella - neous catch any food expen - ditures that haven't already been covered by another food group. They also include broad categories that don't allow identification of which type of food is being referred to, such as \"Snacks\", \"Canned foods\", \"Baby food\", \"Soups\", and \"Sauces\" that may be difficult for interview respondents to easily recall. Figure 6 shows that only 54 percent of surveys meet both food list specificity criteria, indicating that there is great room for improvement in this area. 3.6 Quality of data collected on food consumed away from home The rapid urbanization and globalization that began in the last decades of the 20th century have brought with them \"nutrition transition\" across the globe. Such a transition is marked by changes from traditional diets towards those higher in fat, sugar, caloric beverages in place of water and, as noted above, processed foods. An-other important change that has typically occurs during the nutrition transition is a rise in the consumption of food outside of the home (Maxwell and Slater 2003; FAO 2006; Popkin 2008; WHO 2002). Urbanization Food Consumed Away from Home constitutes a large and increasing percentage of food expenditure in countries thor - ough the developing regions. It also makes for one of the trick - iest items to capture in household surveys. While 90 percent of the surveys assessed did try and capture this item, only 42 percent do so by meeting the minimum reliability criteria. 0102030405060708090100 62.5 At least 10 of the basic food groups have the minimum number of food item s77.1 Less than 5% of food items span more than one food group54.2 Both Note: N=96 survey s IHSN Working Paper No. 008 February 2014 21drives this trend by bringing together increasingly large concentrations of people in one location, making com-mercial eating establishments profitable. Globaliza-tion drives it by bringing with it new imported foods and advertising messages that urge people to eat them. A number of other factors support the trend towards out-of-home food consumption, including: increased incomes, which make eating more expensive, prepared foods affordable; new sources of transportation, which increase the ease with which people can travel or com-mute farther away from their homes; increases in the supply of prepared foods in commercial establishments such as restaurants and street stalls as the demand for prepared foods increases; and the fact that as people, especially women, begin to take on paid jobs, the time for shopping and preparing foods is more limited, mak - ing it more cost-effective to purchase cooked foods (Pingali and Kwaja 2004). There have been precipitous increases in the con- sumption of food outside of people's homes over the last decades in both developing and developed coun-tries (Schmidhuber and Shetty 2005; Drichoutis and Lazaridis 2005; WHO 2002). The example of the Unit-ed States, for which the longest time series is available, is telling: food away increased from 10 to 49 percent of total food expenditures between 1900 and 2010 (USDA 2012a). Other evidence comes from Egypt, where the percentage of meals away from home rose from 20 to 46 between 1981 and 1998, 31 and Mauritius, where (in- flation adjusted) expenditures on prepared foods rose five times between the 1960s and 1990s (Galal 2002; Mauritius Ministry of Economic Development 1997, both cited in WHO 2002). In urban China total expen - diture on food away from home increased by 63 percent between 1995 and 2001 (Ma et al. 2006). And in In - dia the percentage of households reporting consuming full meals away over a month's period rose from 23 to 39 between 1994 and 2010 (Smith 2012). According to Schmidhuber and Shetty (2005), trends in consump-tion patterns associated with the nutrition transition, including increased food consumed away from home, will accelerate more in developing than in developed countries. Taking food away consumption into account is par- ticularly important for measuring calorie consumption because food consumed outside the home tends to be more calorie-dense than food consumed at home (Poti and Popkin 2011; Mancino, Todd and Lin 2009) and the amount of food consumed away tends to increase 31 These percentages include meals consumed at the homes of relatives.faster with increases in income (Senauer 2006; Gale and Huang 2007). The food may also contain more pro-tein and specific micronutrients. 32 Because food con- sumed away is a substitute for food consumed at home, the consequences of not taking it into account is a pro-gressively more unreliable measurement of poverty and food security, possibly including incongruent trends in their indicators that send conflicting messages to policy makers (Smith 2012). For background, Figure 7 gives a typology of food consumed away from home (or \"FCAFH\"), which de - lineates its various components. The overarching con-cept is food prepared away from home, which may be consumed either at home or away from home. Focusing on food consumed away from home, a key distinction to make is the mode of acquisition, of which there are two: Purchased or received in kind. It is very impor-tant to take the latter into account as it can be a large proportion of food away for some populations. 33 An- other key distinction is the place of consumption. In the case of purchased food this may be a commercial establishment--such as a restaurant, bar, street stall, or mobile vendor--or a canteen or cafeteria at a school or work place. Food received in kind outside of the home may be provided by a school, an employer, through food assistance (e.g., feeding), or as a gift from another household. The latter includes food eaten as a guest at another person's home or eaten at a commercial estab - lishment and paid for by others. Snacks, which become an increasingly important part of the diet as nutrition transition proceeds (Popkin 2008), can make up a large proportion of FCAFH since people are less likely to con-vene in the home for snacks than meals. Before considering the minimum reliability criteria for the data collected on FCAFH, Table 3 describes fea-tures of the data collection. Data on FCAFH were not commonly collected in HCES until recently. Ninety percent of the assessment surveys collected some data on FCAFH, rising to 100 percent for the diary surveys. For interview surveys, data were considered to have been collected on FCAFH if any food item in the food list itself, the title of the section in which it is found, or a question regarding the item contains the following words (or variations on them): \"Food eaten out, res-taurant foods, foods eaten in restaurants and other es - tablishments, food away from home, food eaten away, 32 See for example Ma et al. (2006), who show that the rapid rise of food away from home in urban China has been accompanied by a rapid increase in meat demand. 33 For example in India more households report consuming in-kind food away from home than purchased (Smith 2012).

IHSN Working Paper No. 008 February 2014 23food eaten out of the home, food eaten at other people's homes, meals eaten out, or meals away\". The diary sur-veys were judged partially on this same requirement, but also on whether the diary instructions or instruc-tions to interviewers explicitly mention food consumed away from home. The detail or specificity with which data are collected is as important for reliable collection of data on food consumed away from home as it is for food consumed within the home. As noted above, the more detail with which data are collected, the better is respondents' abil-ity to recall and the higher is the likelihood that all of the food acquired and/or consumed will be captured given reasonable overall time limits to survey admin-istration. While the large majority of the assessment surveys did indeed collect data on FCAFH, compared to the data collected on food consumed at home the detail with which data are collected is very poor. In the case of interview surveys, 36 percent of those collecting any FCAFH data attempted to capture this broad component with only one line item in the entire questionnaire. Examples of these line items are: Food and drinks consumed outside the home Meals taken outside home Restaurant food, meal eaten at restaurant Cooked food and beverages consumed away from home Outdoor meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner). For surveys employing this method, respondents are typically asked to report on the total expenditures of all household members on these food items over the recall period. Data were collected for multiple places of consump- tion in only 23 percent of the surveys for which any FCAFH data were collected. The most common place was a restaurant, followed by bars, street stalls and educational institutions. Data are collected on in-kind receipts of food consumed outside of the home as op-posed to only purchases for 54 percent of the surveys. Finally, detail on the types of foods and beverages con-sumed is scarce as well. Data were only collected on specific food items consumed away from home for 33 percent of the surveys, and very few dishes were list-ed, certainly not the wide variety that people are likely to eat in restaurants and other commercial establish - ments, especially in urban areas. Snacks and alcohol, both of which tend to be prominent in the expenses and nutrient intake of people eating food away from home were specifically referred to in 30 and 35 percent of the surveys, respectively. The level of detail with which the data on food consumed away from home are collected tends to be greater for diary than interview surveys. Note that data are collected at the individual (as op-posed to household) level for only 17 percent of the sur-veys; doing so accommodates the reality that most food consumed away from home is eaten away from other family members and, most particularly, the survey re-spondent. The reliability of the data collected on FCAFH is judged using three criteria: 1. Whether data are explicitly and deliberately collected on FCAFH (as defined above); 2. Whether the recall period for collection of the data is less than or equal to two weeks; and 3. Whether data are collected on in-kind receipts. If all three of these criteria are met, the data on FCAFH are considered to be minimally reliable. Note that these criteria fall far below optimal data collection, which would entail detailed recording of the actual foods and/or meals consumed for food purchases and multiple sources of food received in kind--including from other households, food assistance, and free food received at schools and work places. Hopefully data collection will improve over the coming years, and the quality bar can be raised. Figure 8 reports on the percentage of surveys meet - ing the three minimum criteria. As mentioned above, 90 percent of surveys explicitly collect data on FCAFH. Seventy three percent have a recall period less than or equal to two weeks. Only 49 percent collect data on in-kind food received, however. Overall 42 percent of the assessment surveys satisfy the three minimum reli-ability criteria for the quality of data on food consumed away from home, signaling that the quality is indeed quite low at this point in time. Assessment of the Reliability and Revelance of the Food Data Collected in National Household Consumption and Expenditure Survey 243.7 Accounting for seasonality of food consumption patterns As recognized in the report of the Seventeenth Interna - tional Conference of Labour Statisticians on Household Income and Expenditure Statistics (ILO 2003), HCES's should cover a full-year accounting period to take into account seasonal variations in expenditures. This is es-pecially important in the case of food, because seasonal variations in dietary patterns, overall quantities of food consumed, and the consumption of particular nutrients can be pronounced (Coates et al. 2012a), partly due to the relationship with cyclical food production cycles. Seasonality in food consumption patterns is cap- tured by repeating a survey multiple times throughout a year's period. The assessment surveys that account for seasonality in some way can be divided into two groups: The first are those for which the survey is conducted two to four times a year, either for the same households or a new sample. Twelve percent of the assessment Seasonal patterns in the consumption of many food items are highly pronounced. 53 percent of the surveys reviewed try to take this into account by conducting the survey two to four times a year (for the same households or a new sample) or by surveying sub-sets, usually one-twelfth, of households in the sample in each month of the year.surveys were conducted in this manner (Figure 9). 34 The second method distributes data collection throughout a year by surveying sub-sets, usually one-twelfth, of households in the sample in each month of the year. This method is employed for just over forty per-cent of the assessment surveys. To capture differences in seasonal patterns across geographic areas within countries, survey primary sampling units should be ran - domly assigned to the different months. Given the information available, it was not possible to de - termine whether this geographical randomization was carried out for each survey. The overall minimum reliability criteria for whether seasonality is taken into account is that either one of the two methods is used. Just 53 percent of the surveys meet the criterion. The surveys that are instead under-taken over a limited time during a year's period risk col-lecting data on food acquisition or consumption, and estimating indicators derived from them, that are not an accurate reflection of the overall, annual pattern in the population. One issue related to seasonality is that concerning measurement of \"usual\" consumption at the house - hold (as opposed to population) level. For indicators that depend on the distribution of consumption across households rather than only means or totals\u2014measures such as prevalences of poverty and calorie, protein and micronutrient insufficiencies\u2014it is important that such usual consumption be captured for each survey house - hold rather than just the sample as a whole. If data are only collected one time for each household for a \"short\" observation period, then usual consumption may not be captured because random shocks are included along with the real between-household inequality in con-sumption, leading to overestimates of and Grosh 2000; Murphy, Ruel and Carriquiry 2012). 34 It was not possible to assess whether the specific times of year for which data were collected are appropriate for capturing seasonality for each of the surveys within the time frame of this assessment. 0102030405060708090100 Note: N=100 survey s90.0 73.0 49.0 on food consumed away from homeRecall period two weeks or les sData collected on both purchase and inkind receipt sAll criteria Note: For second and thir d crit eria, households without dat a collec ted on f ood consumed a way from home ar e included in the per cent age. IHSN Working Paper No. 008 February 2014 25But what defines \"usual\" consumption?35 To assess usual consumption, how many times should data be collected from households and for what observa - tion or \"reference\" period? 36 What difference will extending reference periods and conducting repeat vis-its actually make to estimates of poverty and nutrient insufficien-cies? According to Gibson (2005), a one-time, 7 to 14 day observa - tion period is insufficient for accu-rate poverty measurement. On the other hand, it is commonly agreed among nutritionists that a 24-hour observation period repeated at least twice on two nonconsecutive days is sufficient to capture usu-al nutrient intakes (Coates et al. 2012b). Therefore, the answers to these questions are far from clear and must be considered in future studies. 3.8 Summary Figure 10 gives a summary of the extent to which the assessment surveys meet the minimum criteria for reliability of the food data col-lected. The good news is that many criteria are being met by the large majority of HCES. The criterion most often met was that data are collected on all three modes of ac-quisition. Other criteria that were met by large majorities of surveys are those regarding completeness of enumeration and comprehen - siveness of the food list. While the majority of surveys met the crite-rion that the recall period for food data collection be two weeks or less, a full thirty percent did not. Just over fifty percent of countries 35 Deaton and Grosh (2000) write that a year is a \"sensible\" period over which to judge people's living standards for poverty measurement. Murphy, Ruel and Carriquiry (2012) define usual nutrient intake simply as the \"long-term average intake of a nutrient by an individual\" (p. S236). 36 A reference period is the total period over which a household's consumption and expenditures is observed. The reference period is longer than the recall period if households are visited multiple consecutive times.did not meet the criteria for specificity of the food list and for seasonality to be taken into account. The cri- terion that was met by the lowest percentage of house - holds, just 42 percent, relates to the quality of data col-lected on food consumed away from home, a source of food that is likely to rapidly increase over the coming decades. 020406080100 46.9 A.

Food consump - tion and agricultural production are two critical components for monitoring poverty and household well-being in low- and middle-income countries. Accurate measurement of both provides better contextual understanding and contributes to more effective policy design. At present, there is no standard methodology for collecting food quantities. In many household surveys, respondents are forced to estimate quantities in standard or metric units, typically kilograms or liters. This method requires respondents to convert from whatever unit they actually consumed (e.g., a bowl of rice) to a standard unit. This conversion process is often an unfamiliar or difficult task for respondents and can introduce measurement error. We argue that allowing respondents to report quantities directly in NSUs places less of a burden on respondents and will ultimately improve the accuracy of the information they provide. Despite these benefits, there are some challenges with this approach. First, these NSU quantities must still be converted into standard units for aggregation and analysis. Often, conversion factors are not readily available and must be created, a process that involves its own data-collection effort. A second challenge is that NSUs are by their nature not necessarily stan - dardized across respondents. One person's \"bunch\" of bananas could be half the size of another person's \"bunch.\" Showing reference photos of \"bunches\" to respondents can ensure that the unit \"bunch\" is further standardized when reported. This requires that a photo reference album is also prepared. This Guidebook explains how to properly incorporate NSUs into data-collection activities\u2014from establishing the list of allowable NSUs to incorporating all components into household surveys. A NSU-focused market survey is a critical part of preparing the conversion factors required for effectively using NSU data in analysis work. As such, the bulk of this Guidebook focuses on implementing the market survey and on calcu - lating conversion factors to ensure the highest-quality data when using NSUs. Practical guidance on non-standard units, conversion factors, and reference photos Although existing data must first be taken into consideration, establishing a baseline of properly documented NSUs will most often require conducting a market survey, whereby survey teams seek out item-unit combinations in the market to weigh and photograph. Both market outputs then become inputs to the main household survey: the reference photos are shown to respondents during interviews and the weights are used to create conversion factors that are applied to the reported NSU quantities, facilitating their use in data quality assurance and data analysis. Collectively, these components comprise what is referred to herein as the NSU library. There are several important steps to follow in preparing the library: 1) Preparation\u2014Plan the timing (relative to the main survey) and the locations of the market survey, prepare the necessary market-survey materials (instruments and manuals), and construct a list of item-unit combinations that will be allowed in the main survey; 2) Market survey implementation\u2014 Collect weights and reference photos, taking into account any sub-national variation; and 3) Data documentation for the main survey\u2014Using the market data, create conversion factors for the NSUs and draft clear user protocols for enumera-tors (in terms of reference photos) and data users (in terms of conversion factors).vi viiProcedures for properly implementing these steps are summarized here, and are then covered in detail throughout the Guidebook. a. In terms of planning and preparation, a list of valid item-unit combinations should first be constructed by reviewing, updat- ing, and supplementing as necessary any existing sources that contain information on common NSUs. Next, when planning the market survey, it is especially important to consider its timing relative to the main survey where consumption and agricultural production data will be collected. Ideally, the market survey should be conducted prior to the main survey in order to use the reference photos during the main survey. If necessary, a much smaller-scale market survey can be conducted after the main survey to collect missing weights for any unanticipated conversion factors. Finally, markets should be selected to ensure adequate coverage of NSUs in the relevant context. This is particularly important if NSUs differ across regions. b. Following these preparatory steps and the detailed market-survey implementation guidelines herein will ensure that as many item-unit combinations are collected as possible, the weights collected are comparable and accurate, and the reference photos clearly demonstrate the actual size of the NSUs. Annex I contains sample survey instru-ments. c. After the market survey, the information collected should be prepared for use with the main survey. A library of NSU materials should be compiled, starting with the calculation of conversion factors that can be applied to NSU consump-tion and production quantities collected during the main survey. These conversion factors are used to flag unreasonable quantities for further verification; when surveys are conducted using computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), this can be done during the course of fieldwork. When the main survey is complete, the conversion factors can be used to calculate total consumption, analyze poverty, etc. The library should also include an album of refer-ence photos compiled from the photos collected in the market survey. This album should be used by the enumerators conducting the main survey to provide a reference size for NSUs. Finally, the library must include documentation of how the materials were prepared and how to properly use them during the main survey. We highly recommend that the library be made publicly available for use in other surveys in order to further standardize NSU reporting across data-collection efforts. The library can be continually updated as more information is collected. Annex II to this Guidebook contains libraries for Ethiopia, Nigeria, Malawi, and Uganda, and is available online. Although they are targeted for use with LSMS-ISA surveys, the libraries are intended to be used by any researchers conducting simi - lar survey activities in these countries. The libraries should be considered living documents, to be revised and updated with each new data-collection effort given that available foods and commonly used units and quantities may vary over time. Even so, making NSU libraries publicly available for more countries will make it easier to implement surveys that allow NSUs and will therefore result in improved data-collection for quantities of food consumption and agricultural production.1 1. Introduction Measuring poverty often depends on measuring food\u2014food that is both purchased and harvested from the field. In low- and middle-income countries especially, food consumption still constitutes the largest share of total household consumption. As such, constructing a food poverty line and using it to estimate the total poverty line is the preferred methodology for measuring the share of households that are poor, which in turn is one of the most common welfare-analysis indicators for developing economies. Another important element of welfare analysis is the productivity of income-generating activities. In many low- and middle-income countries, agriculture is a major source of livelihood, and measuring agricultural productivity requires adequately measuring the quantity of agricultural output. Data on food quantity is also important for the computation of unit values for food items and crops, which in turn is critically important for monitoring and analyzing prices. Despite the importance of this information, accurately measuring both the quantity of food consumed and the quantity of agricultural output can be very challenging. 1.1 STANDARD VS. NON-STANDARD UNITS One important aspect of collecting information on food con - sumption and agricultural production is the choice of units in which respondents can report quantities. Many surveys require quantities to be reported only in \"standard\" units such as kilograms, pounds, liters, etc. In these cases, \"local\" or \"non-standard\" units are disallowed. Forcing respondents to report only in standard units simplifies the use of the data (since aggregation/analysis of food-item consumption often requires a common unit of measure) but it can impose a sig - nificant cognitive burden on the respondent, which in turn can reduce the accuracy of the resulting data. Many respondents in low- and middle-income countries are more comfortable reporting their food consumption and pro - duction using familiar \"local\" or \"non-standard\" units instead of standard units. Forcing respondents to convert from these familiar units into standard units during an interview is a type of cognitive task. Recent studies show that asking respon - dents to combine memory recall with cognitive tasks, such as abstracting consumption to a \"typical week or month,\" leads to less accurate self-reporting (Beegle et al., 2010). The forced conversion from non-standard to standard units requires respondents to undergo the process depicted in Figure 1. Respondents 1) must have a good understanding of what a standard unit of a food item is (e.g., how much is a kilogram of rice), 2) must estimate how many standard units correspond to the NSU they know (e.g., how many kilograms fit into a cup of rice), and finally 3) using the conversion from 2, must calculate the quantity consumed in standard units (e.g., 1 cup of rice is about 0.5 kg, I consumed 1.5 cups of rice, so I consumed about 0.75 kg of rice). All three stages place a cognitive burden on the respondent and can lead to sizable measurement error. Allowing respondents to directly report consumption in NSUs would ease the burden on the respon - dents and will ultimately result in more accurate reporting of their consumption.1. INTRODUCTION 2 Figure 1 \u2014 Forcing NSU Conversion vs. Allowing NSUs We consumed 1.5 bowls of rice. How much rice is a kg? I am not really sure. How many kgs of rice are in a bowl? I guess about 0.5 kg.So then I guess we consumed 1.5 bowls of rice X 0.5 kg in a bowl=0.75 kg of rice! We consumed 0.75 kg. We consumed 1.5 bowls of rice. This size.Apply collected conversion factor of 0.689 kg of riceper bowl to get 1.0335 kg of rice consumed.Was the bowlsimilar to thissize, or to thissize?FORCING STANDARD UNITS: More burden on the respondent, less consistency in conversion factors ALLOWING NSUs: Simpli/f_ies respondent's role, conversion factors are consistentHow many kilogramsof rice did you consume in the past 7 days?

Source: World Bank, LSMS Team.3 THE USE OF NON-STANDARD UNITS FOR THE COLLECTION OF FOOD QUANTITY While allowing NSU reporting will eliminate some burdens for the respondent, it does not mean the issues of NSU con - version disappear. Instead, it falls to the survey or research team to acquire the necessary information to take NSU quantities from respondents and convert them to common standard units (i.e., undertake steps 1, 2, and 3 mentioned above). The most critical information required to make the conversions is a list of standard-unit conversion factors for each NSU as well as for each food item. These item-unit con - version factors can be applied to NSU quantities reported by respondents to convert them into standard units (typically kilograms and liters). In an ideal world, a list of such conver - sion factors would already exist for the relevant country or context. However, the current reality is that conversion fac - tors are not readily available in many low- and middle-income countries. When they are available, they are often limited in scope or poorly documented, making their applicability and reliability hard to determine. When reliable conversion fac - tors are not available, it is up to the national statistics agency or research team to collect the weights and calculate the conversion factors required to convert non-standard units into clearly and widely measurable standard units such as kilograms or liters. Going about collecting the necessary information to prop - erly incorporate NSUs into a survey and make NSU quan - tities usable for analysis is not a trivial process. The varied nature of NSUs introduces significant challenges to any sur - vey or research team undertaking this task. For example, similarly named NSUs can vary significantly within countries or subnational regions. Even within the same locality, NSUs often come in more than one size (e.g. small, medium, large). The challenges are particularly significant for vaguely defined NSUs such as pieces, heaps, bunches, etc. A \"heap\" of toma - toes can vary dramatically in size, making it difficult to con - vert each respondent's \"heap\" in a consistent and accurate manner. While these challenges are significant, there are no comprehensive guidelines on how to properly collect this information. This Guidebook is meant to fill this gap by highlighting the necessary steps and best practices for collecting this information. Establishing a systematic, well-documented, and more precise set of conversion factors for non-stan - dard units\u2014and using it to both inform survey design and to convert reported measurements\u2014will go a long way toward increasing the accuracy of crop-output estimates and household consumption. This in turn will allow for more informed policymaking on important development issues such as household and individual welfare as well as agricul - tural productivity. 1.2 THE MARKET SURVEY There are a few methods for calculating conversion factors. One such method suggested by Cap\u00e9au (1995) and Cap\u00e9au and Dercon (2006) is to compare unit prices using econo - metric techniques to estimate conversion factors. While this method is fairly simple to implement, it suffers from some drawbacks. Primary among these is that unit prices can vary because of factors unrelated to the actual mass or volume of an item. For example, unit prices can vary because of quality differences (Deaton 1997) or because of price discounts on larger units (Attanasio & Frayre, 2006).1 In addition, unlike conversion factors, prices can be subject to significant volatil - ity due to market forces. These sources of variability in unit prices unrelated to mass or volume can result in distorted or imprecisely estimated conversion factors. The main alternative method is to conduct a market sur - vey where non-standard units are sought out and directly weighed. This is a more intensive process than calculating conversion factors from unit prices, but will likely result in more accurate conversion factors. When conducting a market 1 Under this methodology, a numeraire unit price (usually kilograms or liters) is used to compare with other units. For larger units, there may be discount in the price per kilogram and thus applying the numeraire unit price would underestimate the conversion factor for larger units. The reverse is also true for smaller units.Figure 2 \u2014 Vaguely Defined NSUs How much? One small pile. Source: World Bank, LSMS Team.1. INTRODUCTION 4 survey, there are certain protocols that must be followed to ensure the collected weights are accurate and usable for cre - ating conversion factors. For example, conversion factors for vaguely defined units (especially non-container units such as pieces, heaps, bunches, etc.) are most reliable when accom - panied by reference photos. These photos can be shown to the respondents to provide standardized reference sizes for a \"small heap\" of onions, for example. Without the photos, the \"small heap\" reported by the respondent could be con - siderably different from the \"small heap\" used to establish the conversion factors (see Figure 2). These reference pho - tos must therefore be taken and collected along with the weights. 1.3 THE MAIN SURVEY Once all the requisite information is collected for proper implementation of NSUs in a survey, the interview process becomes much less taxing on the respondents, without additional burden on the enumerators. The bottom panel of Figure 1 depicts the revised process. The respondent is only required to think about consumption or production in the unit with which she is most familiar. The enumerator simply confirms this unit using the reference photo and then records the amount in NSUs. Afterward, conversion factors are applied to the reported NSUs to arrive at the correct standard weight. 1.4 THIS GUIDEBOOK This Guidebook serves as a reference for preparing and using non-standard units: establishing a list of valid NSUs, collecting standard weights and reference aides for NSUs (usually via a market survey), calculating conversion factors from these weights, and incorporating NSUs into household and agriculture surveys. It also provides a library of local units, conversion factors, and photographic aids for selected countries. The Guidebook is structured as follows. Section 2 provides background on non-standards unit (NSUs), dis - cusses the importance of properly quantifying household consumption and production, and offers various methods of collecting this data. The section also details the bene - fits and challenges of NSUs and documents their use in the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) implemented by the LSMS team of the World Bank. Section 3 outlines the components of a high-quality NSU library as well as the necessary procedures for conducting a market survey to collect the components of the library. Section 4 discusses some of the important benefits that are derived from utilizing CAPI survey meth - ods to both collect and use information contained in a NSU library. Section 5 offers concluding remarks. Annex I pro - vides a set of sample instruments for collecting and then using NSUs. Annex II is available online and provides librar - ies of NSU conversion factors from four countries (Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, and Uganda). THE LIVING STANDARDS MEASUREMENT STUDY-INTEGRATED SURVEYS ON AGRICULTURE (LSMS-ISA) is a household survey project to foster innovation and efficiency in statisti - cal research on the links between agriculture and poverty reduction in the region. Recognizing that existing agricultural data in Sub-Sa - haran Africa suffers from inconsis - tent investment, institutional and sectoral isolation, and methodolog - ical weakness, the LSMS-ISA proj - ect collaborates with the national statistics offices of its eight partner countries to design and implement household surveys with a strong focus on agriculture. In each part - ner country, the LSMS-ISA sup - ports multiple rounds of a nationally representative panel survey with a multi-topic approach designed to improve the understanding of the links between agriculture, socio - economic status, and non-farm income activities. The frequency of data collection is determined on a country-by-country basis, depend - ing on data demand and the avail - ability of complementary funding.5 2. Methodologies for Reporting Consumption and Production Quantities Food consumption and agricultural production are two of the most important measurements in living standards surveys as well as in many other household surveys in low- and middle-income countries. Food consumption is the primary component for many measures of poverty, nutrition, and food security. Information on agricultural production provides important insights on agricultural performance as well as farm household income and own-food consumption. The critical importance of consumption and agricultural production quantities has led to the development of several different measurement methodologies. Each method has its merits and drawbacks and is not necessarily applicable in all situations. However, we argue that the use of non-standard units to measure quantity is widely applicable and strikes a fair compromise in terms of cost. 2.1 COLLECTING DATA ON FOOD CONSUMPTION The various methods of collecting food-consumption data are the subject of a large and well-established body of liter - ature. In general, consumption information is typically col - lected via respondent recall interviews or a consumption diary. For recall, respondents are asked to estimate their consumption of an item over a specified period, typically seven days. Under the diary method, respondents are asked to keep a daily diary of their consumption. Both methods require respondents to report quantities of food consumed. Though there is a broad range of survey-design issues (see Beegle et al., 2010 for a review of these issues), the discussion here will focus on collecting quantities, as this is the specific design focus of this Guidebook. There are many methods used to collect information on the quantity of food consumed in a household survey. Smith & Subandoro (2007) discuss seven primary methods, sum - marized as follows: 1. Metric (i.e., standard) units: Respondents report quantities in metric units such as kilograms or grams. While this method is low cost and relatively easy to record, it can result in inaccurate esti-mates in some circumstances (see below). 2. Monetary value: Respondents estimate the mone-tary value of the quantity consumed or produced. This method requires additional collection of met-ric prices in order to estimate quantities, which can also be subject to significant errors. 3. Local (i.e., non-standard) units: Any unit of mea-surement that does not have an objective, univer - sal metric or standard weight. This includes items such as \"pail,\" \"basket,\" or \"pieces;\" the latter is discussed in #4 below. 4. As in #3, respondents report quantities in terms of non-standard units with which they may be more familiar. These methods ease the burden on the respondent (in terms of memory recall and conversion calculations), but can increase the cost of survey implementation.2. METHODOLOGIES FOR REPORTING CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION QUANTITIES 6 5. Volumetric equivalents: Respondents demonstrate how much space the food they consumed would take up. Conversion factors would need to be ap-plied to convert to metric units. 6. Linear dimensions: Respondents provide linear measurements (length and width or circumference) of the amount of food consumed. As Smith & Subandoro (2007) point out, this method likely takes more time to complete as it requires physical measurement rather than a simple vocal response. 7. Food models: Respondents choose a two- or three-dimensional depiction of a food item that best corresponds to their consumption amount. This method can provide very accurate estimates, but it can be costly to prepare the models and cal-culate their weights. While one method may be optimal for certain items, it may not be feasible or appropriate for others. Smith & Subandoro (2007) advocate using a combination of these methods. This Guidebook and the accompanying library will focus on four of these methods, which are complementary and compre - hensive: metric units, local units, including a count of pieces, with some two-dimensional depictions (i.e., reference pho - tos). Joint use of these four methods will minimize the burden on the respondent as well as on the enumerator, although it may require additional costs beyond the main survey visit. 2.2 COLLECTING DATA ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION There are three prevailing methods for measuring agricul - tural production: farmer recall, whole plot harvest, and crop cutting (Sud et al., 2016). Under the recall method (as with recall for food consumption), farmers estimate how much of a particular crop they have harvested since a certain date. Both whole plot harvest and crop cutting are much more labor-intensive processes that attempt to eliminate the sub - jective bias or error inherent in farmer estimates. Under the crop-cutting method, a portion of a farmer's crop is cut and measured by enumerators at the time of harvest. However, there are some potential sources of bias that arise in the crop-cutting method (Fermont & Benson, 2011). Whole plot harvest is similar to the crop cutting method, but the output of the entire plot is cut and measured. This is considered the most accurate yield measurement, but is also extremely costly to implement on a large scale. While there are numer - ous issues associated with all three of these methods, they are largely beyond the scope of this Guidebook (see Fermont & Benson, 2011 and Sud et al., 2016 for a review). The focus here is on the collection of harvest quantities. In principle, many of the consumption-quantity collection methods outlined by Smith & Subandoro (2007) are also applicable to the collection of agricultural-production quan - tities. However, there is one additional issue that is specific to the measurement of crop harvests. The condition of the crop\u2014threshed, shelled, fresh, dried, etc.\u2014can have a large impact on reported harvest quantities (Fermont & Benson, 2011; Diskin, 1999; Murphy et al., 1991). The weight difference is either due to discarding a portion of the crop via thresh - ing, shelling, or peeling, or is the result of a change in mois - ture content through drying. These processes are particularly important for cereals and legumes, which are quite often processed before being used or sold. It is therefore import - ant to ensure that when a harvested quantity is reported, the condition of the crop to which the quantity refers is also specified. When quantities are reported for various condi - tions, additional condition-specific conversion factors can be applied to render the quantities comparable . 2.3 IMPORTANCE OF NON- STANDARD UNITS IN HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS The methodological issue that is the focus of this Guidebook is the use of non-standard units in the collection of con - sumption and production quantities. But what exactly are \"non-standard\" versus \"standard/metric\" units? Both stan - dard and non-standard units are commonly used in markets or by households in many countries. Standard units are uni - versally constant, referring to a clearly defined weight and/ or volume. A kilogram in Uganda is the same as a kilogram in France. Likewise, a kilogram of maize is the same weight as a kilogram of wheat. For the most part, \"standard\" encom - passes metric units, imperial measurements, and other inter - nationally standardized units that are easily converted into metric units. For example, the conversion between kilograms and pounds is constant regardless of region or item. In contrast to standard units, non-standard units (NSUs) often vary greatly from item to item, region to region, and even village to village. Table 1 presents examples of some common standard units and NSUs.7 THE USE OF NON-STANDARD UNITS FOR THE COLLECTION OF FOOD QUANTITY Some NSUs are common across many locations. For example, throughout the world, bananas and other items are often measured in bunches. While this NSU is common, it is not standardized. The number and size of the bananas that are in a bunch are not standard; one bunch of bananas could be three times the size of another bunch. Likewise, a bunch of bananas is not equivalent to a bunch of herbs. The same is true for pieces, heaps, and other units. In addition to these common NSUs, there are also NSUs that are spe - cific to a country or region. Table 1 includes several NSUs commonly used in Uganda (far right column). Many of these units are locally familiar containers of a standard volume; however, the weight of the contents will vary depending on the item. For example, a Nido tin of rice does not weigh the same as a Nido tin of groundnuts. The use of local units can vary significantly within a country. As an example, Table 2 presents the distribution of local units in Nigeria observed Table 1 \u2014 Examples of Standard and Non-Standard Units Standard Non-standard Common Local (Uganda) Kilograms Sack Jerrican Grams Bunch Kimbo/Blueband tin Liters Heap Nido tin Centiliters Piece/number Cup/mug Pounds Bucket Nice cup Crate Plastic basin Table 2 \u2014 Regional Variation of NSUs in Nigeria % of all NSU Observations in Zone North Central North East North West South East South South South West Mudu 56.7 62.4 17.4 0.0 0.7 0.0 Olodo 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 14.0 0.0 Congo 7.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 47.9 Paint rubber 3.9 0.2 0.6 12.1 0.0 2.7 Derica 0.4 1.3 0.2 2.5 16.1 13.8 Milk cup 27.3 8.9 21.4 21.6 42.6 28.8 Cigarette cup 0.5 0.0 0.1 60.7 22.3 0.0 Tiya 0.0 26.7 58.5 0.0 0.0 0.0 Kobiowu 2.8 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0in the second wave of the General Household Survey Panel (GHS-Panel) for each of the six geopolitical zones. Only one unit (milk cup) is common to all six zones. Most units are only found in two to three zones and are rarely or never observed in others. These complexities associated with NSUs create some challenges relative to standard units. However, there are additional factors that contribute to the relative merits of the methods, detailed further below. 2.4 NON-STANDARD UNITS IN HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS BENEFITS OF ALLOWING REPORTING IN NON-STANDARD UNITS There are trade-offs involved in deciding whether to allow respondents to report quantities in NSUs or to restrict respondents to reporting in only standard units. Although NSUs are subject to significant variation, there are tangible benefits to allowing respondents to report in NSUs. The most important and overriding benefit is that respondents will likely be better able to estimate quantities using NSUs. In rural areas especially, standard units may not be commonly used in markets and respondents may not regularly use stan - dard units in their daily activities. Even though respondents may know exactly what a kilogram of sugar looks and feels like (a very common sales unit for sugar), they may not know this for cassava, maize, or other items that are not typically traded in kilograms at the household level. Likewise, many items are not generally consumed in standard units. Often, fruit is sold by the piece instead of by weight; herbs are Note: Shaded cells = Units rarely/never observed in that zone. Source: World Bank, LSMS Team.Source: World Bank, LSMS Team.2. METHODOLOGIES FOR REPORTING CONSUMPTION AND PRODUCTION QUANTITIES 8 sold by the bunch, regardless of weight variation; and home- grown fruits or vegetables are harvested and eaten without being weighed. When respondents are more familiar with NSUs for specific items, it may be too burdensome to expect them to know that item in terms of standard units . Forcing respondents to report quantities in standard units often combines two self-reporting styles, each with its own potential for error: memory recall and cognitive reasoning. Household consumption modules typically ask respondents to recall a litany of food items eaten by numerous household members over a given period. Farming households are asked to recall and report on a variety of different crops harvested over a given period. The latter case is further complicated by the fact that key crops throughout the region (e.g., cassava, maize, and plantains) are typically harvested in small quanti - ties on a continual basis. Both memory recall and ad-hoc unit conversions also require mathematical calculations that, while not necessar - ily complicated, are prone to errors when done in the field and on the fly\u2014even more so when considering respondent and enumerator fatigue. Combining memory recall with unit conversion increases the number of calculations required of the respondent for each value, which further increases the potential for error (as shown in Figure 1). In general, allow - ing respondents to report in the units they can most easily quantify simplifies memory recall and will yield estimates that are more accurate. CHALLENGES OF ALLOWING REPORTING IN NON-STANDARD UNITS Although there is a strong case for allowing respondents to report in NSUs, many surveys of consumption and agri - cultural production still restrict respondents to report - ing amounts in standard units. This is primarily due to the additional cost and challenges associated with properly implementing and operationalizing NSUs in a survey. The complexity of NSUs as well as the additional steps required for their use can increase the financial and temporal bur - den of conducting a survey. The challenges associated with using NSUs broadly fall into two categories: (1) those asso - ciated with the preparation and implementation of the sur - vey with NSUs, and (2) ensuring NSU measurements can be converted into comparable standard units. One of the first challenges that survey designers face is identifying the units to be included in the survey. When respondents are limited to reporting in standard units, com - piling the code list is straightforward. However, compiling a list with non-standard units requires additional information about the common NSUs in the relevant country and/or regions. When such information is limited or not available, it will need to be collected via a market survey. In addition to identifying the NSUs to include in the main survey, survey designers also need to ensure the clarity of the unit definitions. Some of the most common units that fall into this category are pieces, bunches, or heaps. For example, a piece of sweet potato could weigh 0.5 kilograms or 1.5 kilo - grams. Figure 3 below illustrates this problem: the pictured containers vary significantly in size but are all called dengu in Malawi. In order to obtain the most accurate estimates for these units, respondents should be provided with a refer - ence frame for the quantity. One way to do this is to pro - vide respondents with reference photos for these items. This resource can also be produced as part of the market survey and requires additional enumerator training (detailed below). Figure 3 \u2014 Wide Variety of Dengus of Tomatoes in Malawi The final and most significant challenge in using NSUs is that they must be accompanied by standard-unit conversion factors. In their raw form, quantities in NSUs are not compa - rable across units. To directly compare and aggregate quanti - ties, the data user must convert all quantities into a common standard unit such as kilograms. Converting between Source: World Bank, LSMS Team.9 THE USE OF NON-STANDARD UNITS FOR THE COLLECTION OF FOOD QUANTITY standard units is relatively easy since the conversions are constant and well known. However, for NSUs, the conver - sion is different for each unit and often for each item. Com - plicating matters further, the standard weight for the same item-unit combination can vary, even within a country. For example, one study in Nigeria found that an average bundle of sorghum weighed between 26 and 49 kilograms depending on the area (Casley & Kumar, 1988). When this is the case, region-specific conversion factors should be acquired. HOW COMMON ARE NON- STANDARD UNITS IN SURVEYS? In low- and middle-income countries, especially in Africa, NSUs are used quite regularly for the most important items. At markets in these countries, consumers encounter a wide variety of NSUs for their purchases. In addition, when given a choice between reporting quantities in standard or non-stan - dard units, respondents often choose to report in NSUs. For example, in the second wave of the Ethiopia Socioeco - nomic Survey from 2013/2014 when NSUs were allowed, nearly 50 percent of farmers chose to report their harvests in NSUs. In the Malawi National Panel Survey, respondents chose NSUs about 73 percent of the time. This provides a strong indication that many respondents are more comfort - able reporting quantities in NSUs. While the challenges associated with including NSUs in a consumption or agricultural production survey can be sig - nificant, this Guidebook provides detailed instructions to help survey designers incorporate NSUs into their surveys.

Guidelines and Procedures for Capturing and Using Non-Standard Units This section lays out the necessary steps and procedures required to collect the information necessary to implement and use NSUs in household surveys. Before NSUs can be used, a resource library for NSUs will need to be prepared. This library should include (1) a list of common/ allowable NSUs; (2) national or regional conversion factors for all item-unit combinations; (3) a photo reference album based on an index of NSUs; and (4) clear protocols for using conversion factors and reference photos in agricultural and household surveys. The best way to collect the information for the library is to conduct a market survey to capture reference photos and the item-unit weights used to calculate conversion factors. In countries where surveys already allow reporting in NSUs, existing data (once updated, if need be) can complement the library. Taken together, these components will help researchers to adopt the use of NSU reporting; for countries with libraries provided in this Guidebook, the cost/burden of adoption is significantly eased. These libraries should not be treated as fixed, but should instead be continually updated with new NSUs and conversion factors. There are several important steps to follow when collect - ing the components for an NSU conversion-factor library (see Figure 4): 1) Preparation\u2014Plan the timing (relative to the main survey) and the locations of the market survey, prepare the necessary market-survey materials (instru - ments and manuals), and construct a list of item-unit com - binations that will be allowed in the main survey; 2) Market survey implementation\u2014Collect weights and reference photos, taking into account any sub-national variation; and 3) Data documentation for the main survey\u2014Using the market data, create conversion factors for the NSUs and draft clear user protocols for enumerators (in terms of reference photos) and data users (in terms of conver - sion factors). Each of these steps is covered in detail here. 3.1 MARKET SURVEY PLANNING AND PREPARATION TIMING OF MARKET SURVEY The data-collection schedule for the market survey should take into consideration the seasonal availability of items and existing data-collection schedules in each country. In some cases, market-survey data collection should be planned for two separate periods to ensure more complete coverage of seasonally available items. In general, the greatest variety of items and the greatest variety of crop conditions will be available during the harvest season, though some items may only be available during the lean season or after a secondary harvest season. 11 THE USE OF NON-STANDARD UNITS FOR THE COLLECTION OF FOOD QUANTITY The timing of the market survey relative to the main sur - vey is important. Performing the market survey before the main survey ( ex-ante or independently) has several advantages. First, reference photos can be taken and then used during the main survey, and conversion factors can be used to validate reported quantities during fieldwork, both helping to ensure more accurate NSUs estimates. Second, conducting the mar - ket survey ex-ante allows for the identification of additional NSUs that may be missing from any existing list of answer options. Identified in advance, these units can be incorporated into the unit list for the main survey. However, there are also some drawbacks to conducting the market survey before the main survey. The primary one is that new units not included in the market survey could be reported in the main survey. When the market survey is per - formed after the main survey ( ex-post ), the unit list for the market survey can be constructed to include all item-unit (and item-unit-conditions) observed in the main survey, thus limiting any conversion-factor gaps. Given these considerations, the ideal plan is to conduct two market surveys\u2014one before and one after the main survey. Both market surveys need not be equally rigorous; one will likely be more comprehensive than the other. For example, the ex-ante survey could be limited, aiming to collect reference photos and weights (for conversion-factor calculations) for the most common NSUs, while the ex-post survey could com - prehensively collect weights for all additional NSUs reported during the main survey. Or the ex-ante survey could be inten - sive, aiming to collect as many conversion-factor weights as possible\u2014especially when conducted independently\u2014while the ex-post survey could be limited to collecting only those unanticipated item-unit combinations. In general, the intensive version of the market survey should coincide with the season when the most items will be available in the markets. Many household surveys already conduct market surveys as part of their fieldwork to collect current pricing infor - mation on commonly consumed items. When surveys allow NSU reporting, the market surveys could also collect actual weights of allowable NSU combinations that can be used to calculate standard-unit conversion factors. However, in such cases where the market survey is conducted in parallel with the main survey, reference photos would most likely not be available for use during interviews. SELECTION OF MARKETS TO VISIT Three main factors will influence the selection of markets for the survey: 1) the degree of regional diversity of units and their respective weights; 2) the relative timing of market surveys (as explained above); and 3) the types of markets fre - quented by sample households. Markets should be selected to ensure adequate coverage of regional units and items. For market surveys conducted after the main survey, coverage can be assessed using the item- units observed in each stratum. The strata where the widest diversity of regional units is observed are prime candidates for the market survey. If the item-units were reported in the stratum, it is likely that measurements for that item-unit can be obtained from a market in that area. If the market survey is conducted independent of or prior to the main survey, ade - quate coverage must be assessed using external information on regional variations in units as well as information from the pilot survey (if conducted). In many countries, households may patronize various types of markets, including local outdoor markets and small shops, supermarkets, wet markets, and wholesale markets. Markets selected for the survey should cover the full range of markets commonly used by households or farmers in the sample area. In general, the number and dispersion of markets selected for the survey is highly dependent upon the context. For a nationwide survey in a large and diverse country like Ethio - pia, it would likely be necessary to visit many markets across the country to ensure adequate coverage of NSUs, espe - cially if the market survey is conducted during or after the main survey. However, for a market survey limited to a single region/state or community, visiting only a few markets may be sufficient. PREPARATION OF SURVEY MATERIALS Once markets are selected, the survey materials (survey instruments and supporting manuals) can be prepared. While these materials should be designed according to the local con - text, Annex I includes examples from NSU-focused market surveys that were conducted to create the LSMS conver - sion-factor libraries for Ethiopia, Malawi, and Nigeria. Figure 5 depicts a snapshot of the market survey questionnaire for Ethiopia. Though these survey instruments are specific to these countries, they also serve as examples of how to prepare instruments for any country/project. Each survey can collect the following key types of data: Market identification details: Name, location, GPS infor - mation, type of market, etc.3. GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR C APTURING AND USING NON-STANDARD UNITS 12 Survey management information: Date, time, duration of surveys; codes for enumerator, supervisors, and (when applicable) data-entry staff. Data on pre-identified NSUs: Weights, prices, and basic metadata for common item-unit combinations that have been previously identified. Data on unexpected NSUs: T eams can collect the same type of data listed above for item-unit combinations that are not pre-defined, but that are present in the market. If such NSUs are commonly used in a regional market, it is likely that household survey respondents are purchasing, and thus more readily able to report, in these quantities. The Nigeria survey is split into two sections, allowing enu - merators to more easily divide and share the data-collection work during each market visit. Detailed instructions on how to collect the data and complete the questionnaires are in the training manuals (also included in Annex 1). 3.2 CONSTRUCTING THE LIST OF NON-STANDARD UNITS The first step in preparing the NSU library is to establish the list of common NSUs that will be used in the consumption and/Figure 5 \u2014 Excerpt from a Market Survey Questionnaire MODULE B: ITEM-UNIT MEASUREMENT - NONCONTAINERS 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ITEM NAMEITEM CODEUNIT NAMESIZE Was item measured?

A list of common/ allowable item-unit (and when applicable, item-unit-condi - tion) combinations for NSUs should include a comprehen - sive set of valid NSU combinations for each crop and each food item. Where applicable, crop/food condition (e.g., corn in husk or not, peanuts shelled or unshelled, fresh vs. dried cassava) should be considered, especially for reporting har - vested quantities, as the condition significantly impacts the weight-volume ratio. While it may be impossible to prede - termine all the possible combinations, the library should endeavor to include combinations that represent the vast majority of options (preferably higher than 90 percent). Even when the same crops are grown and the same foods are con - sumed in different countries, it cannot be assumed that the same NSUs will be used in both places.2 The best practice for compiling this list would be for national statistics agencies to establish a conversion-factor library independent of any specific household survey, which can then be made available for use with any new survey within the country. Unfortunately, many low- and middle-income countries have no such source for NSU conversion factors; when they do, documentation and other supporting materials are often limited or lacking. When a conversion-factor library is available and well documented, household survey teams may choose to optimize timeline and budget constraints by using this existing resource. When such a library does not exist, or if existing conversion-factor data are limited or outdated, an NSU-focused market survey must accompany the household survey. Instructions for the market survey are discussed in detail in the next section. When implementing a market sur - vey to fill these data gaps, the procedure for identifying the NSUs to include in the market survey will vary depending on the stage at which this step is performed. MARKET SURVEY BEFORE/ INDEPENDENT OF MAIN SURVEY When the market survey is implemented before or indepen - dent of the main survey, the first step is to seek any infor - mation on common NSUs within the country. Identifying common NSUs and the items they apply to can be quite chal - lenging, depending on the quality of information available to help guide selection. A best first source would be a com - prehensive review of NSUs within a country. The libraries 2 Cross-country comparisons may be used to check the consistency of allowable item-condition combinations and to reconcile food-weight densities for common crops. This cross-country harmonization will be the focus of future work in this series.annexed in this guidebook are intended to be such a source, but there may be additional reviews available, such as Kor - mawa & Ogundapo (2004) in Nigeria. When comprehensive reviews are not available, the next preferred source for common NSUs will be other surveys already conducted in the country of interest that have allowed quantities to be reported in NSUs. These could be either household-level surveys with consumption or agricultural components, or market surveys. For these outside sources, the survey designer must consider the comprehensiveness of the NSU list. Some surveys may include only a few of the most common NSUs and exclude less common though important ones. Likewise, the geographic coverage of the survey also needs to be taken into account. For example, surveys that only cover a small area may not contain NSUs that are com - mon in other areas of the country. Unless the selection of NSUs is clearly documented and comprehensive, the survey designer should seek additional information. If resources and time permit, existing NSU lists can be val - idated with a small pilot survey to ensure the list is compre - hensive and current. The pilot survey can either be at the household or market level. Performing a household-level pilot has the advantage of capturing consumption units used by households, which may differ from the units used in market transactions. However, conducting even a limited market-level pilot survey will allow for the collection of a wide array of item-units in a single market, whereas it may take several households to acquire a comprehensive list. The pilot survey should be largely open ended, allowing respondents (either household members or market vendors) to report in the units with which they are most comfortable or in the units that are most commonly available. Many units may be available in different sizes, such as the array of dengus shown in Figure 2. In this case, simply listing dengu in the selected unit list would not sufficiently help stan - dardize this NSU. When there is variation, the unit list should include the possibility of different sizes (e.g. small, medium, large) and the weights and reference photos for each size should be collected. This is particularly important for units such as pieces or heaps, which are subject to within-unit weight variation. When NSUs are coupled with reference photos depicting multiple measured sizes, it provides greater comparability across reported NSUs by standardizing the respondents' reference points. For example, if tomatoes are scarce in only one region, what is considered a \"large tomato\" may be equivalent to a small one elsewhere; by providing standardized photo references, the respondent can point to 3. GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR C APTURING AND USING NON-STANDARD UNITS 14 \"their\" tomato, thus ensuring its weight is converted in a standardized way, regardless of local variation. Note that a key benefit of conducting an ex-ante market survey and using photo references in the main survey is that much of the regional variation can be eliminated, which in turn limits the scope and burden of the market surveys to be conducted. Without the ex-ante collection (which allows for greater standardization with fewer measurements), you will need to collect and compare NSU data from markets in all regions to avoid under or over-reporting consumption across regions with different concepts of reference sizes. MARKET SURVEY AFTER MAIN SURVEY For market surveys conducted after the main survey, the NSU list can be constructed based on the units observed in the data. Constructing the list ex-post can shorten the list of weights needed to exactly those necessary to make use of the data while ensuring there are no gaps in the eventual conversion-factor data. When constructing the list of item-unit combinations, the data should be examined for combinations that are commonly observed. Invalid combinations should be excluded. Ideally, every valid item-unit as well as crop condition observed in the data should be included in the list of units for the market survey. However, if the list of observed item-units is exten - sive and/or resources for conducting the market survey are limited, then the item-unit list can be shortened. The most obvious method is to eliminate the least commonly observed item-units. This will depend greatly on the survey, but in gen - eral only very infrequently observed combinations should be dropped. The extent of regional variation in reported NSUs should also be assessed to determine at what level the market survey should be conducted. This can be done by comparing com - mon units at various geographic levels. If at most geographic levels the item-units are similar, then a national list can be constructed. However, if there is significant variation across regions, it may be more appropriate and feasible to disaggre - gate the item-unit lists to the regional level. 3.3 COLLECTING WEIGHTS FOR CONVERSION FACTORS The two main purposes of the market survey are to col - lect weights in order to calculate conversion factors for consumption and production NSUs and to take reference photos of item-unit combinations for respondent interviews. Although the procedure for collecting both these items may seem straightforward, strict protocols should be followed to obtain the most accurate conversion factors and produce useful reference photos. A dataset of national or regional conversion factors for all allowable combinations will be the main analysis compo - nent of the library. The listed conversion factors should be provided at the lowest feasible (and representative) level of regional disaggregation. The general procedure for collecting weight measurements involves (1) finding vendors who have the necessary non-standard item-unit combination, (2) prop - erly weighing the item-unit, and (3) recording the weight of the item-unit. Step 1: Finding item-units to weighArmed with the list of item-unit combinations to weigh, enu - merators should seek out each of the combinations from vendors in the market. Each item-unit measurement should be taken from multiple vendors to account for any varia - tion in vendors' subjective assessment of what constitutes a unit amount as well as for possible enumerator error in the measurement itself. For each item-unit pair we recom - mend collecting measurements from three different vendors within each market if time, personnel, and budget constraints permit. Survey teams need not limit measurements to the prede - termined list of item-units. If additional item-unit pairs are found at the market, record these as well. This will be partic - ularly beneficial when the market survey is conducted before the main survey as it will allow the new units to be incorpo - rated into the main survey. If an item is available in the market, every effort should be made to collect all the listed unit options for that item. The greatest challenge at this stage will likely be that some items or units are not found due to seasonal availability of the item or limited use of a unit for sales. One solution is to search for the item-unit at vendors nearby who are outside the formal market. If the item-unit is found there, the alternative location should be noted by the enumerator. The day of the market visit could also be an important determinant of NSU availability. In many communities, there are specific days designated as \"market days.\" On market days, a wide array of traders and farmers will participate in the market and thus, a greater selection of items and units will likely be available. However, there will also be more 15 THE USE OF NON-STANDARD UNITS FOR THE COLLECTION OF FOOD QUANTITY activity on these days, making it harder to perform the mea - surements. Vendors may also be less willing to participate in the survey on a market day since they will be busier. Given this trade-off, we recommend survey teams visit the market first on a non-market day to acquire all the measurements available, and then again on a market day if any items or units are missing. Since the focus of the survey is on consumption or produc - tion units and not specifically on market units, some contain - er-based units may not be found at the markets. This could especially be the case for some agricultural production units used by farmers but not typically sold by vendors. Enumera - tors can ask vendors about the units in which they themselves purchase items from farmers, asking them to demonstrate the appropriate quantity of the item-unit pair. Alternately, survey teams may be able to acquire such containers directly from the source, (i.e., nearby households or farms). Contain - ers may be purchased or borrowed and then brought to the market for filling and weighing . Larger units, especially those used for measuring harvest quantities, may not be available from market vendors, but can be collected at the market scale station (further details below) or from wholesale traders in the market. Locating a crop at the market in its various conditions will likely be difficult. Many crops will only be available in their final condition before consumption: cereals will likely be threshed; legumes will likely be shelled. In such cases, addi - tional weights may need to be acquired by conducting some measurements at the farm-household level. A limited number of condition-specific weights can be used to create conver - sion factors across item-unit-condition pairs. Step 2: Weighing the item-units Once an item-unit is located, it must be properly weighed. When weighing a container unit, the empty container's weight must be excluded from the measurement. Many modern scales can automatically subtract the weight of a container (the \"tare\" weight) from the total weight. If the scale being used does not include the option to zero out the tare weight, then the subtraction must be done manually. Enumerators must be properly trained in the use of scales, including how to identify appropriate (even) surfaces on which to use the scales. Scales should be calibrated regularly during fieldwork to ensure consistency across measurements. It is important that the scale be kept clear of any other objects, including any spillage from containers. For example, any grains that fall out of a heaped container and onto the scale should be cleared before weighing. Enumerators should not be responsible for determining the amount of the item with which a particular unit is filled. They should only weigh what vendors provide. This includes typical heaping practices for containers. If the local practice is to heap as much of an item into a container as possible, then that is what should be weighed; if leveling is common, then leveled containers should be measured. When container quantities are available heaped and level, both should be mea - sured and noted. While most item-units will require physical weighing of the unit, in some cases no weighing will be required. This is true for item-units that are commonly purchased prepack - aged, with the weight printed on the container. Some com - mon examples are bags of rice, tinned or canned foods (e.g., tomato sauce), snack items, etc. Note that although these item-units need not be weighed, reference photos must still be taken since respondents may not remember the weight of the package but can identify which size/shape package they consumed. For most consumption units, collecting the weights will be fairly straightforward. However, for larger units\u2014 especially those used for production\u2014there may be additional chal - lenges. Heavier item-unit pairs are often beyond the maxi - mum range of the portable scales used for the survey. When this is the case, there are two potential solutions: Break up the unit into a series of smaller groups that can be weighed separately. Once all the groups have been weighed, they can be added together to acquire the total weight of the item-unit. Depending on the size of the item-unit and the maximum range of the scale used, this can be a laborious and time-consuming process. Further - more, vendors may be unwilling to open larger units (if sealed) and have them handled by enumerators. Make use of other scales that have a higher maximum weight. These can be either additional scales that enumer - ators bring with them to the market or higher-capacity scales found in the market. In many markets, there will be bulk traders or aggregators that purchase items from farmers for resale to market vendors. Since these traders deal in large quantities, they will likely have a scale that can measure these heavier weights. Making use of these market scales may be easier than breaking up the item-unit into multiple groups, but it does require an additional 3. GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR C APTURING AND USING NON-STANDARD UNITS 16 step: calibrating the market scale. In general, market scales may not be as advanced or accurate as the main scales used for the survey. Any error in the market scale mea-surement must be estimated and corrected. That can be done by selecting an item that weighs close to the maxi-mum of the survey scale. This same item should then be weighed using the survey and the market scales and both measurements should be recorded. Comparing these two measurements will allow for error correction in the mar - ket scale's measurement during the data-review process. Only one calibration is needed for every market scale. Since it may be impossible or at least impolite to adjust or even scrutinize the market's scale, consider doing this after all unit measurements are collected. This procedure requires that the measurement tool also be noted: survey scales or a market scale. These scales will typically not be as precise as the smaller-capacity scales, but they are suf-ficiently precise for larger units. If higher-capacity market scales are not available or common in the market, then larger-capacity scales may be acquired for use by enumer - ators for larger units. Another potential challenge for production units is the adjustment of weights by bulk traders or aggregators. In some cases, traders will purchase an item-unit from a farmer and adjust the weight before distributing it to market vendors. For example, a farmer may bring a sack with 115 kg of wheat, but after purchasing it, the trader might adjust the weight of the sack to an even 100 kg before selling it to market vendors. The purpose of the market survey is to acquire conversion factors for units reported by farmers , so every effort should be made to weigh the item-unit the farmer brings to the market (e.g., the 115-kg sack of wheat) before it is adjusted by the trader. Step 3: Calculating the conversion factorsCalculating conversion factors can be a complicated process. Results from the market survey should be cleaned and outli - ers scrutinized. If there are relatively few measurements for each item-unit, outliers can distort conversion factors sub - stantially. If different sizes for a unit were allowed, the mea - surement data may require further processing. A problem may arise where classifications of a small, medium, and large versions of a unit could vary considerably. For example, the small size of a unit found in market X may be larger than the large version collected in market Y. These must be reconciled so that there is a standard classification of small, medium, and large within the relevant level of geographic aggregation (e.g., region, state). This can be done manually through review and comparison of the reference photos and reassignment of size. However, this can be burdensome if there are many measure - ments. An alternative method is to classify measurements based on their position in the distribution of measurements for that particular item-unit pair. The most basic approach is to classify observations that fall below the 33 rd percentile as small, between the 33rd and 66th percentile as medium, and above the 66th percentile as large. However, the number of sizes must be considered before applying this method. Some units may only be found in two relatively uniform sizes, in which case only small and large size should be assigned. If possible, a review of the photos is arguably a more compre - hensive approach, or at least a verification step, to solving this problem . For some items, the additional component of condition will also need to be taken into consideration when calculat - ing conversion factors. In most of these cases, conversion factors should be applied not only for converting to kilogram amounts, but also to render the quantities comparable to each other. For example, maize/corn can be harvested on the cob (usually fresh) or without the cob in grain form (usually dry). The kilogram conversion reported for fresh, on the cob maize is not directly comparable with the kilogram results of dry maize grains. To compare all reported maize conditions with each other, the conversion between maize on the cob and maize dry kernels/grains is also needed.3 Once cleaned, the measurements must be aggregated to an appropriate level. The mean or median measurement for each container unit can be used. For non-containers, the con - version factor will be item specific and should correspond to the reference photo included in the library. If there is signifi - cant regional variation, then regional-level conversion factors should be given. Otherwise, national conversion factors are adequate. The conversion-factor database should be orga - nized so that there is a single conversion factor for each item- unit at the appropriate geographic level, though there may be some item-units not found in a particular region. Therefore, we recommend that national-level conversion factors also be provided even if there is significant regional variation. Figure 6 presents a subset of the conversion-factor library for Nigeria. In the figure, conversion factors are provided for the six geo - political zones as well as the national average. 3 The appropriate adjustment factors for this exercise are not part of the original set of libraries found in Annex 11, but could be considered in future conversion libraries and methodological research. 17 THE USE OF NON-STANDARD UNITS FOR THE COLLECTION OF FOOD QUANTITY 3.4 COLLECTING REFERENCE PHOTOS The second element that must be collected during the mar - ket survey is a set of non-standard unit reference photos. After the market survey, all photos should be compiled and included in the library. This index should contain photos of all allowable item-unit combinations, with each one directly linked to the measurements used in the conversion-factor list. For example, the pieces of yam in a photo should be exactly the same pieces used to calculate the conversion factors as described above, and something in the naming scheme of the photos should make this connection clear. This index of photos will be used to prepare the photo ref - erence album. WHICH ITEM-UNITS REQUIRE PHOTOS? Ideally, each item-unit included in the survey (including pre - packed foods) will have a reference photo. Practically, surveys Figure 6 \u2014 Excerpt from a Conversion Factor Library for Nigeria NIGERIA GHS-PANEL WAVE 3 CONVERSION FACTORS ITEM CODEITEM NAMEUNIT CODEUNIT AND PROCEDURES FOR C APTURING AND USING NON-STANDARD UNITS 18 may wish to limit the photo book to items that represent a significant portion of the total food consumed or total food expenditures. It is essential that separate item-unit pho - tos be taken for each non-container unit such as pieces or heaps. However, for container units (pails, plates, etc.), a single photo for each container may be sufficient since the volume of the container does not vary with the item it holds. Item-specific photos of containers are useful if the fill level (heaped/level) varies significantly across each item. If units are expected to differ by region (e.g., only the North uses baskets, or the object called a pail in the West is different from the pail used in the East) then different photos must be taken in each region as well. However, for units that are relatively uniform across the survey area, only one photo need be taken. GUIDELINES FOR REFERENCE PHOTOS The primary purpose of these photos is to compile a ref - erence album for use during household survey data collec - tion. With this tool, respondents can estimate quantities in relation to the related reference size. For example, when shown a reference photo of a potato during the household survey, a respondent can say she ate three potatoes of the size shown, or consumed one potato that was about half the size of the reference potato. Additionally, the photos serve an internal purpose in the creation of the conversion factors, as they can be used for verification/validation of weight mea - surements collected by the market team. The photo quality, while important for both applications, is far more critical for the reference album that will be shared with respondents. When enumerators are instructed to take photos of all mea - surements, the research team will have multiple pictures to choose from when compiling the photo reference guide. For the reference photos to be useful, they must depict the referenced quantities in a way that can be easily under - stood and interpreted by survey respondents. Regardless of the enumerators' general familiarity with taking photos, ample time should be allotted for training enumerators on the photo requirements for this exercise. Effective and eas - ily interpreted reference photos should adhere to these guidelines: Photos should be well lit so that respondents can easily see the items and differentiate between the item and its shadow or background. When possible, a plain background should be used for each photo. This could be a piece of paper, a sheet, or some other material. The plain background will serve to better highlight the item, especially when its color con - trasts with the item color. Each photo should contain only one food item or one food unit. For example, a photo of shelled groundnuts should not include unshelled groundnuts or maize; a picture of pails (a unit used for various items) should not include bunches or piles of a particular food. For units that come in various sizes (e.g., small, medium, large), all sizes of the item-unit must be present in the Figure 7 \u2014 Correctly Photographed Sahin s of Rapeseed The near horizontal side angle shows the containers are filled in a \"heaped\" style, allowing for better understanding of the volume.

The items should always be in the same size order (i.e., left to right, ordered from small to large) in the picture. However, some units may be too large to include the size variations in a single photo. For such units, spe-cial care must be taken to ensure that the photos of the different sizes are directly comparable - this means that they are taken from the same angle and same distance and include the exact same reference item (positioned the same way relative to each item-unit). A size reference item must be included in the picture to illustrate the relative size of the main objects. The item should be something that generally comes in one standard size, is easily identifiable to respondents, and could be brought to interviews by enumerators.

GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR C APTURING AND USING NON-STANDARD UNITS 20 Figure 10 \u2014 Correctly Photographed Empty Pails (to be used as unit reference for multiple items) Photo includes only one reference unit to avoid confusion for respondent. To reduce enumerator error in recording responses, items are pictured in order (small, medium, large), which is done consistently across all photos. ples include a water or soda bottle, a writing pen, a box of matches, etc. This is a critical component of the photo. Without it, respondents may not be able to accurately judge the size of the item-unit in the photo. The dimension or volume of the item-unit must be clear. Usually this means taking the picture from a side angle, either directly horizontal to the item, or slightly above horizontal. For some non-container units such as pieces, aerial photos (taken from directly above) may be accept - able or sometimes preferred. The key is to ensure that the volume of the item is conveyed in the photo. Several example photos are shown in this section. Figures 7 through 10 (above) are examples of photos that follow these guidelines. Each photo has a reference object (a soda bottle in this case), a plain background, sizes shown in the appropriate order, and all taken from an angle that allows respondents to accurately gauge the size/volume of the unit. Figures 11 through 14 are examples of photos that were not taken correctly and will be difficult for respondents to interpret. Figure 11 shows a direct overhead view, whereby the volume of the container cannot be accurately gauged. The photo could be of a shallow plate or a very deep bucket, but it is impossible to tell from the photo. The item is also not photographed in its original container, which makes it more difficult to understand the volume. Figure 12 features three different sizes, but the direct over - head angle may be misleading for piles of vegetables. Does the large pile have only the five pieces shown, or are there more stacked underneath? How many pieces are really in the medium pile? There is also no reference item, so it is impossi - ble to tell if the small items are the size of golf balls or tennis balls. Finally, the items are in reverse order (large to small); assuming the other photos and the questionnaire list/label units from small to large (as is most commonly done), then photos that do not follow this pattern will increase the likeli - hood of enumerators incorrectly recording (transposing) the unit size of the item shown during data collection. In Figure 13, all three sizes are included, as is a reference item. However, the background adds a lot of unnecessary dis - traction. And the inclusion of onions in the photo may confuse respondents. In Figure 14, the items are also in reverse order. More prob - lematic, though, is that the small basket (on the right) was pho - tographed separately using different backgrounds, angles, and Source: World Bank, LSMS Team.21 THE USE OF NON-STANDARD UNITS FOR THE COLLECTION OF FOOD QUANTITY Photographed in a different container.

Source: World Bank, LSMS Team.23 THE USE OF NON-STANDARD UNITS FOR THE COLLECTION OF FOOD QUANTITY distances from the camera for both the basket itself, as well as for the basket in relation to the reference item. All these details make the small basket in the photo visually similar (or greater) in appearance than the medium basket. This is not a useful ref - erence for a respondent and will compromise the accuracy of the data reported. To comply with the guidelines discussed above, survey teams will often need to have access to a large staging area in which to take photos, especially for larger units or when more than one size of a unit is photographed at once. In compact or crowded markets, this can be a significant challenge. Enumerators may not have enough space to position the camera sufficiently far away to capture all elements in the photo. Similarly, enumera - tors may block passages in the market when taking the photos. This can cause disruption in the market and create animosity from vendors or market patrons. If the market is crowded or very compact, enumerators should try to find a staging area where they can take photos without much difficulty or distur - bance. They should then attempt to collect as many measure - ments from vendors near the photo staging area. CREATING AND USING THE PHOTO REFERENCE ALBUM Photos collected from the market survey should be scru - tinized. The best photo should be selected for each item-unit combination for inclusion in the bank of reference photos. This reference tool will be used to establish a clear connection between the respondent's reporting and the established con - version-factor database. If the size of the reference album must be limited, focus on the most commonly reported NSUs. Ref - erence aides should be printed in color, using a durable material that will withstand fieldwork (such as cardstock, or laminated paper), or should be shown on tablets if the survey is conducted using computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) technology. The list of reference photos should be organized to match the survey sequence and thus facilitate its use in the field. Forcing enumerators to flip through a multitude of pages of photos to find a particular item or unit will waste time and result in frustra - tion on the part of both the enumerator and the respondent. Both CAPI and paper-based surveys can benefit from printed photo ref - erence albums, which can sometimes be more easily shared with respondents during an interview. When administering the consumption or agricultural produc - tion questionnaire, the enumerator should allow the respondent to report quantities in the unit with which the respondent is most familiar. The enumerator should not provide the respondent with the list of allowable item-unit combinations, but should instead refer to the list to ensure that the item-unit provided by the respondent is indeed valid. If the unit the respondent gives is not listed, then the enumerator should use his or her judgement regarding its validity. After the respondent has specified the quantity in the preferred unit, the enumerator should check to see if there is a reference photo for the item-unit. If there is, the enumerator should show the photo to the respondent and verify that the pictured unit is similar to that referred to by the respondent. If applicable, the enumer - ator should also ask which size of the unit most closely matches. The respondent may need to re-estimate his or her consumption/production in terms of the reference photo. 3.5 HOW TO USE THE NON- STANDARD UNITS LIBRARIES Once all the necessary components are assembled into the NSU library, protocols should be drafted to provide guidance to both enumerators and data users on how use the library. Clear pro - tocols for using NSUs and reference photos must be provided to field teams for the primary household and agriculture sur - veys. Likewise, clear protocols for using the conversion factors must be provided to data users. Each NSU library should include clear, coherent, and concise documentation so that the libraries can easily be used by researchers and field teams. Incorporation of NSU materials into household and agriculture surveys will require additional preparation, which can be done by the house - hold survey team or as a final step in completing part of the NSU library documentation, in which case each household survey team will need to evaluate the available materials in order to adapt them to its needs. This preparation includes revising the consumption (and when applicable, harvest) questionnaire sec - tions to include NSUs and crop conditions; preparing the photo reference guides to be used by teams; and providing instructions to enumerators on how to effectively incorporate these new resources. Annex I contains examples of documents used to incorporate NSUs into the Ethiopian Socioeconomic Survey: the food consumption section of the household survey, including a code sheet for reporting NSUs; a photo reference guide to be printed, bound, and used by enumerators during their interviews; and a sam - ple section of an enumerator training manual that provides instruc - tion to enumerators on the use of the questionnaire and the photo reference guide. A snapshot of the Ethiopia consumption question - naire that incorporates NSUs is shown in Figure 15. The LSMS team has created conversion-factor libraries for Nigeria, Ethiopia, Malawi, and Uganda, with more planned for Tanzania, Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso. They are provided 3. GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES FOR C APTURING AND USING NON-STANDARD UNITS 24 online in Annex II as they were used to support LSMS data-collection efforts in each country. The process of com - piling these libraries has made it possible to further refine the guidelines and best practices outlined herein. Although some of these libraries may not have the complete set of recommended items or may have some photos that do not meet all the stated recommendations, they can still serve as valu - able resources. Both partial and completed libraries can be used by researchers and fieldwork teams to help increase the accuracy of reported quantities in their own work, without incurring the significant time-cost burden required to establish a new set of con - version factors. Even so, the libraries should be considered living documents, to be revised and updated with each new data-collec - tion effort. Available foods and commonly used units and quantities may vary over time, so even complete libraries should be reviewed and piloted prior to their use on a new project.Researchers conducting their own fieldwork can begin by includ - ing the existing lists of allowable item-unit pairs into consumption and production questionnaires, training enumerators on the proper use of photo reference aides, and incorporating the provided data - set of NSU conversion factors into interview and data entry checks. When possible, research teams should do a brief pilot test of the commonly-available NSUs in their survey area, as these may change over time or vary across regions; conversion-factor data and pho - tos would only need to be collected for any newly available combi - nations. For research projects focused on analysis of existing data, where that data allowed for NSU reporting but conversion factors may not be available, the LSMS libraries can help increase the num - ber of usable observations. Annex II provides additional information and user instructions on each of the available libraries.

However, some aspects of the information collected for use with NSUs can be greatly enhanced when used with computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI). CAPI provides unique benefits when conducting a market survey, particularly with respect to the ability to directly link weight measurements with reference photos. When conducting the main food consumption or agricultural production survey, CAPI can make better use of collected reference photos as well as conversion factors (to identify outliers). Both these aspects are discussed in turn here. 4.1 CAPI FOR MARKET SURVEYS Market surveys are ideal candidates for collection using com - puter-assisted personal interview (CAPI) technology. Per - haps the strongest advantage that CAPI collection has over paper is that photos can be directly linked to measurements. When conducting a market survey using paper, one must ensure that the photos can be linked to the correct weight measurement observation. One way to ensure this link is to apply a rigorous naming scheme for the photos, referenc - ing the item-unit, the market in which it was taken, and the measurement observation it refers to (if there are multi - ple measurements within the same market). Renaming these photos while conducting the survey can be time consuming for enumerators and can lead to mistakes. However, when using CAPI software (such as Survey Solutions), photos can be taken immediately after recording the measurement and can be directly linked to that measurement observation. The photo is automatically named with a reference to that spe - cific case. In addition, CAPI software can provide a prompt to enumerators to take a photo of the measured item. This can help ensure that there is at least one photo taken for every item-unit measurement collected. In addition, CAPI technology also makes the collection of additional metadata much easier. For example, GPS coordinates where each specific measurement is taken (or at least the more general market location) can be automatically captured by the CAPI device. Likewise, the date and time the measurement was taken can also be automatically recorded. Collection using CAPI also allows for on-the-fly consis - tency checks. Since relatively few measurements will be taken within a market, it is important to limit the potential for error when collecting weights in standard units. For exam - ple, the current measurement can be compared with previ - ous measurements and flagged if it is significantly different. Likewise, a predetermined reasonable range for a particular item-unit can be applied. These bounds must be made flexible and must only account for the most egregious mismeasure - ments. For example, for very small units, any measurement over X kg would be unreasonable. These kinds of checks can identify some common errors such as reporting weights in grams instead of kilograms. However, there is at least one potential drawback to using CAPI to conduct a market survey. In some cases, it could be more difficult to move between item-units within the listing on a CAPI survey. While conducting a market survey, the enumerators will not go item-unit by item-unit. Instead, they will move within the market collecting what item-units they see, not necessarily in order. For the CAPI program to be 4. BENEFITS OF USING COMPUTER-ASSISTED PERSONAL INTERVIEWING (CAPI) 26 usable in the market setting, enumerators must be able to move easily between item-units in the list. Survey Solutions CAPI allows for such flexibility; evaluation of other software options should take this into consideration. 4.2 CAPI FOR FOOD CONSUMPTION AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION SURVEYS All the reference library resources detailed above can be used with both paper-based and computer-assisted per - sonal interviews (CAPI). Several CAPI-based programs have capabilities that allow photo references to be incorporated into the interview, so that an enumerator can share relevant images with the respondent as an item is being discussed. In several cases, programs connect the photo directly to the item-unit combination represented, so that \"selecting\" the photo automatically defines the conversion factor for the item reported. The importance of collecting data on allowable item-unit combinations and calculating their conversion factors prior to the start of fieldwork is made even more critical with CAPI. When used with CAPI, these tools can create more dynamic in situ validation checks for enumerator use. Allow - able combinations can be programmed into CAPI, so that only these options can be selected for any given item. The full set of such combinations is usually far more than an enu - merator can be expected to recall during an interview, so building them into the parameters of the survey reduces the number of invalid observations reported during data collec - tion. By applying conversion factors to data as they are being collected, reporting errors can be flagged and reviewed with respondents at the time of the interview, further reducing the number of invalid observations and eliminating the need for costly follow-up visits. CAPI programs can include checks of each item, including confirmation that price per kilogram and/or total and per capita standard-unit quantities are within reason. Some CAPI programs can also generate checks and reports compiled across multiple items entered, creating a summary list of all crop harvests in kilograms, listed in order of quantities, that enumerators can review with households for on-the-spot validations, ensuring that top-reported crops match farmer's expectations, for example. When collect - ing data on household consumption, caloric values can be included to generate food-consumption summaries; enumer - ators can review these immediately with household mem - bers, checking, for example, that the average caloric intake of household members is within reason, and that the ranking of foodstuffs by caloric share of diet makes sense. As with any survey using CAPI, it is worth emphasizing the importance of dedicating sufficient additional time and resources to ensure the CAPI program is well programmed and that all checks and validations are incorporated before fieldwork\u2014and even before training and piloting\u2014begins. This additional up-front time will ensure that interviews run more smoothly, save time, and produce less data errors.27 5. Conclusion Food consumption and agricultural production are two of the most important and commonly measured quantities for welfare analysis in low- and middle-income countries. Both are critical inputs into poverty estimates for these countries and agricultural production is essential for estimating farmer productivity. Many strides have been made in improving several aspects of these estimates, but until recently the challenge of converting non-standard (NSUs) has received less attention. The usual practice has been either to limit households to reporting in standard units or to have enumerators estimate the conversion to a standard unit on an ad-hoc basis, both of which can be very problematic and lead to poor estimates. The use of NSUs can increase the accuracy of reported quantities in food-consumption and agricultural-production surveys. Reliably documented conversion factors for NSUs ensure that data robustness is not reduced by the loss of valid observations. The objective of this Guidebook has been to provide advice to survey practitioners on incorporating non-stan - dard units into their surveys, along with practical guidance on how to create a complete NSU library resource for coun - tries where one does not currently exist. In addition, the Annexes to this Guidebook include sample questionnaire instruments as well as resource libraries from the LSMS-ISA project (Nigeria, Ethiopia, Malawi, and Uganda). The librar - ies can be of use when working on any surveys or with any survey data in the selected countries. The Annexes include the allowable item- (and condition-) unit combinations for each of the countries and all photo references collected. The Stata files containing the conversion factors are available at www.worldbank.org/lsms under Publications/Guidebooks. 28 REFERENCES Attanasio, O., & Frayne, C. (2006). Do the poor pay more?

A number of decisions must be made, many of which are controversial, and most often the decision making process is based on well -establish ed practices rather than on theoretical arguments (Lanjouw, 2009; Deaton and Zaidi 2002). In this paper we focus on consumer durable goods and investigate their contribution to determining the living standard of the household. In general, long -lived items such as automobiles, appliances and furniture have a positive and significant impact on living standards. Sometimes the outlay on durable goods only claims a small fraction of disposable income, but they most often change the lifestyle of the individuals, either by saving their time - as in the case of housework appliances - or by consuming their time , as with entertainment appliances (Offer 2005). Either way, consumer durable goods clearly matter to the wellbeing of individuals and there is an increasing consensus on the fact that any welfare measure should account for them (Slesnik, 2001, Deaton and Zaidi 2002, OECD 2013) . In the first part of this paper we review the theoretical underpinnings of the methods available to deal with durables. We outline the main alternatives found in the literature and discuss their advantages and disadvantages in the context of poverty and inequality analysis. We end up our review by arguing that the so- called \"user cost approach\" is well worth our recommendation (Diewert 2009). The underlying idea is that it is not the expenditures on consumer durables that should be included in the welfare aggregate. Rather, it is the flow of services from durables that must be valued and comprised in the welfare aggregate, and the user co st method estimates it simply by calculating the difference between the value of the durable at the beginning of analytical the period and its actual value at the end of the same period. While simple, this method is not na\u00efve, and offers the 2 further advant age (not shared by the rental equivalence approach) of being a viable solution given the information typically available in household budget surveys. The second part of the paper is devoted to measurement issues. What is simple in theory can turn into a thorny problem in practice. In fact, the estimation of the user cost of durable goods is an exercise fraught with difficulties. Data limitation is probably the single most important obstacle to implementing the user cost method. We discuss how data limitatio ns can be overcome, or at least dealt with, by overviewing the current practice for a number of countries all around the world. PART I - THEORY 2 Concepts and definitions What is a durable good and why durable goods require a special treatment? These are t wo focal questions that need to be addressed before outlining the theoretical approaches available to deal with consumer durable goods and their role in the measurement of living standards. A durable good is a consumption good that can \"deliver useful services to a consumer through repeated use over an extended period of time\" (Diewert, 2009 p. 447). The main characteristic of a durable good does not depend on its physical durability , a property shared by many other consumption goods, but by the fact that, like capital goods, it is productive for two or more periods . According to the System of National Accounts (SNA) - the internationally agreed set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity - \"....the distinction is based on whether the goods can be used once only for purposes of production or consumption or whether they can be used repeatedly, or continuously. For example, coal is a highly durable good in a physical sense, but it can be burnt only once. A durable good is one that may be used repeatedly or continuously over a 3 period of more than a year, assuming a normal or average rate of physical usage. A consumer durable is a good that may be used for purposes of consumption repeatedly or continuously over a period of a year or more.\" (SNA 2008: 184) . Housing is clearly a durable good, arguably among the most important ones in most consumers' bundles. Due to its importance, however, the way rents and imputed rents are estimated for inclusion in the welfare aggregate is the object of a separate paper . 4 In this paper we focus on consumer durable goods other than housing5. The SNA definition helps to answer the second question, namely why durable goods require special treatment when measuring living standards. The essence of the problem lies in the inconsistency between the so- called reference period chosen for the welfare aggregate, and the period of time during which durable goods deliver their utility to the consumer. In theory, prior to the analysis, \"we need to decide the reference period for welfare measurement, whether someone is poor if they go without adequate consum ption or income for a week, a month, or a year\" (Deaton 1997: 151). Once this choice is made, the same reference period must be applied to all the components of the welfare aggregate, no matter if it is pears or t- shirts, electric fans or cars. In practice, very rarely the reference period exceeds one year; most often, it coincides with the year 6. If we assume that the reference period is one year (or less), then it is clear that durable goods, by their very 4 This follows a well- established practice according to which, a welfare aggregate is constructed by putting together four building blocks, namely (i) food consumption, (ii) non-food consumption, (iii) durable goods and (iv) housing [Deaton and Zaidi 2002: 25]. 5 According to the Classification of individual consumption by p urpose ( COICOP) nomenclature , consumption goods are classi fied as non durable (ND), semi -durables (SD) and durable (D). The consumption goods classifi ed as durable belong to the following categories: furniture, furnishings, carpets and other floor coverings, major household appliances, tools and equipment for house and garden, therapeutic appliances and equipment, vehicles, telephone and fax equipment, audiovisual, photographic and information processing equipment (except recording media), major du rables for recreation, electrical appliances for personal care, jewelry , clocks and watches (ILO, 2004) . 6 In most LSMS questionnaires the recall period for nonfood items does not exceed one year. 4 definition, pose a problem: how to reconcile the fact that items whose economic life extends beyond the reference period of the welfare aggregate must be part of it? The purchasing market price of a durable good is clearly an inadequate pricing concept. This is because the purchasing market price corres ponds to the value of the durable good for its entire economic life, while what we need is the value of the use of durable goods for a shorter period, the reference period. Unfortunately, the value of the use of a durable that contributes to the welfare during the reference period is rarely, if ever, directly observed. This explains why durable goods require special treatment: the expression coined in the literature is that we need to estimate the consumption flow of durable goods, that is to estimate the b enefit accruing to the household from the ownerships of durable goods, limited to the reference period of analysis. The impact of using the consumption flow instead of the purchasing price of the durable depends on the purposes of the analysis. Let us star t with the context of the system of national accounts (Moulton 2004; Young 2005). The value of expenditures on consumer durables tend to fluctuate widely over the business cycle, while the value of their services (the consumption flow) varies more smoothly . This suggests that the latter measure provides a better picture than the former of the changes of a nation's economic welfare over time and make international comparisons more meaningful Katz (1983: 406). While the 2008 SNA recognizes these advantage s, in practice, \"the SNA measures household consumption by expenditures and acquisitions only. The repeated use of durables by households could be recognized only by extending the production boundary by postulating that the durables are gradually used up in hy pothetical production processes whose outputs consist of services. These services could then be recorded as being acquired by households over a succession of time periods. However, durables are not treated in this way in the SNA. A possible supplementary e xtension to the SNA to allow for such an extension of the production boundary could usefully take place in a satellite account.\" (SNA 2008: 184). A similar issue arises in the construction of a consumer price index (CPI). As argued by Alchian and Klein (19 73), any analytically correct measures of inflation should take account of changes in the price of durable goods. The point was, in fact, made by Irving 5 Fisher as far back as 1911, when he explained that to base a price index only on \"services and immediately consumable goods would be illogical\" (Fisher 1911: ch. 10, X.39). The claim that durable goods should be covered by the consumer price index has never been disputed from a theoretical standpoint. Yet, in practice, the task of incorporating the price dynamics of consumer durables is not straightforward. A special treatment of the prices of durables is often necessary in order to moderate the observed volatility in measures of inflation that incorporate changes in the price of assets (Goodhart, 2001). Eve n more relevant to the present context is the fact that if the CPI is to serve as a cost -of-living index, then the pricing concept should hinge on the cost of the use of the services of the durable good during the reference period rather than on its purcha se price (Diewert 2004, 2009). When it comes to measuring living standards, poverty and inequality, the estimation of the value of consumer durables is also crucial. The use of the purchase price instead of the consumption flow leads to overestimate the effect of economic cycle on the household welfare, to underestimate absolute poverty, and most likely to bias the poverty profile (Deaton and Zaidi 2002). A well -documented study on Russia, for instance, shows that the impact on inequality can be very larg e: the Gini index of expenditure increases from 32 percent to 44 percent when the full purchase value of durables is included instead of its use value ( World Bank 2005: 9) . Irrespective of the angle that one may take, the estimation of the consumption flow from durable goods stands out as a complex task. The main reason is that the value of the flow of services of a durable depends on its physical deterioration rate but also on the (unobserved) expected price of the durable 7. This imputation exercise can be interpreted as a special case of the classical problem of the measurement of capital, one of the oldest and most contentious areas of economic theory ( Hicks 1955 ; Hulten 1990; Downs 1986). 7 There are circumstances were the estimation of the consumption flow is a simple task. If the consumer purchases the services of durables - for instance renting a car - then the price that s/he pays does the job as it represents the consumption flow. Unfo rtunately, in most cases ownership is not separated from usage and analysts must deal with the impu tation problem. 6 3 Main theoretical approaches for dealing with durables In this sec tion we discuss the main theoretic al approaches to estimate the consumption flow from durable goods. We begin by introducing some notation. Consider a household in year t, owning a durable good manufactured in year (t-v) and purchased in year ( t-s), where 0, and let , denote the market price of the durable in period t , When =0, , denote s the market price of a new durable ; when >0, , corresponds to the (second - hand) market value in period t of a v-year old durable good. The consumption flow of the durable in period t is defined as follows: (1) =,\u00d7, where ,+. Equation (1) expresses the current value of the flow of services ( ) for a generic v -year old consumer durable purchased s years back in time , as a fraction ( ,) of the market price (,). The coefficient , is typically less than one, but in principle can be greater than one.8 The main theoretical approaches to dealing with durable goods can be described as different procedures for estimating the coefficient ,. Following Diewert (2009) , we distinguish between three alternatives: (i) the acquisition approach; (ii) the rental equivalence approach and (iii) the user cost approach. We depart from Diewert as the focus of our analysis is limited to consumer durable goods , and in particular we do not cover owner -occupied housing. Unlike Diewert, we are not much interested in consumer price indices but rather in constructing a household level we lfare indicator and ultimately in evaluating the distributional impact of alternative measurement methodolog ies. Our attempt, in the rest of this section, is to develop a unified approach - here expressed in equation (1) - that encompass es the three approaches above . 8 This is likely to be the case of, say, a Picasso painting or of a vintage car. 7 3.1 Acquisition approach When a durable good is purchased by a household and its entire value is attributed to the household expenditure, we say that the durable good is treated according to the acquisition approach (also known as \"net acquisition approach\"). Looking at equation (1), this approach amounts to specifying the coefficient , as follows : (2) ,()=1 =0 0 >0 In equation (2), the argum ent \"a\" in ,() stands for \"acquisition\". According to the acquisition approach, =0 if the household does not purchase the durable during the survey year t - eq. (2) says that ,()=0 for all items for which s> 0, that is for items purchased prior to the current period t. Note that the definition does not contemplate v, that is, it does not matter if the durable is new or used. A positive consumption flow =,0 is attributed to durable goods purchased b y the household when s=0, that is during the survey year . Under the assumption that the market price ,0 captures the current value of all services provided by the durable over its entire economic life, then the net acquisition approach assigns the household the entire stream of current and future productive services of the durable in year t and zero for subsequent years. The acquisition approach ignores the problem of distributing the initial cost of the durable over the useful life of the good and a llocate the entire charge to the period of purchase [ILO 2003: 419]. Further, t he acquisition approach is clearly distortionary: it underestimates the welfare of households that owns used durable goods with respect to households who happened to purchase durable goods in the current year.9 When the net acquisition approach is used for the construction of the consumption aggregate, both the level and the 9 It is certainly true that this distortionary effect is less important if we are interest in aggregated variables but we cannot say that it completely vanishes (see section 4 ). 8 budget shares of durables tend to mirror the business cycle. This is due to the fact that households tend to postpone the purchase of durables when the economy slows down, and to increase it when the economy boosts. 3.2 Rental equivalence If rental or leasing markets for consumer durable goods exist, then the market rental prices can be used to estimating consum ption flows from durable goods. This method is known as the rental equivalence approach [ILO 2003, Diewert 2009]. Suppose that in period t a competitive market exists, where households can purchase the services of v-year-old durable goods. Consumers can rent a car or a refrigerator, for example. Also assume that households own homogeneous durable goods , that is assume that all goods are of the same type and quality. Let , denote the market rental value of the v-year-old durable good. If markets are competitive and the economy is in equilibrium, then the market rental value , measures the consumption flow from the durable owned by the household.10 Going back to equation (1), the rental equivalence approach s pecifies ,() as follows : (3) ,()=, , where , , is the rental ratio with respect to the market value of the durable owned by the household, also known as the capitalization rate . In equation (3), the argument \"r\" in ,() stands for \"rental\". If we substitute (3) in (1) we obtain =, . In the rental equivalence approach, a pivotal role is clearly played by the market prices for the services of durable goods. However, three restri ctions must be introduced in order to make the approach fully consistent: (a) one must assume the existence of a complete set of 10 We also do not consider here taxes and transaction costs. 9 markets for the services of the durables owned by the household; (b) markets must be competitive and (c) the economy must be in equilibrium. If assumption (a) does not hold we cannot apply the method and if one of the other two assumptions is violated the market rental value does not reflect necessarily the household welfare gain from using the durable in pe riod t . An additional concern with the rental equivalence approach has an empirical nature. The estimate of ,() in equation (3) requires the availability of market rental prices in period t for services of vintage -v durable goods. Even if, according to assumption (a), such a market exists, this does not necessarily imply that actual transactions are available in the sample. When markets are thin, 1) it can be very difficult to observe rental prices for all the durables owned by the households, and 2) prices are likely to suffer from heterogeneity11. The first condition is well- known and well documented in the literature that deals with the measurement of the cost of shelter for homeowners (see, among the others, Gillingham 1983). One solution for de termining rental price equivalents for consumer durables is to ask households what they think their durables would rent for. Perception, however, does not always and necessarily matches with reality. Households might have imperfect information on current m arket prices especially with regard to consumption goods purchased or sold infrequently ( or never purchased or sold) . 3.3 User cost The user cost approach is based on a concept first introduced by Keynes (1936, chapter 6, p. 53) and successively reformulated b y Jorgenson (1963). The idea behind the approach is highly intuitive: the user cost approach calculates the cost of purchasing the durable at the beginning of the period, using the services of the durable during the period and then netting 11 Note that this should not happen if markets were perfectly competitive. Hence, the empirical relevance of point 2) may indicate a violation of the perfect competition assumption. 10 off from these c osts the benefit that could be obtained by selling the durable at the end of the period ( ILO 2003: 422)12. Let , denote the market price of a durable produced in year t -v, but purchased in year t -s. We assume here that the purchase took place at the beginning of period t . Similarly, let +1,+1 denote the market price of the same durable at the end of period t . This notation (both indices are now v+1 and s+1) reflects the fact that at the end of the period t both the vintage of the good ( v) and its purchase date have increased by one unit. T he user cost evaluated at the end of period t can be defined as follows : (4) =(1+),+1,+1 where is the nominal interest rate in period t . The user cost can be interpreted as the opportunity cost of owning for one period the durable instead of selling the durable at the beginning of period t . Equation (4) can be manipulated to show that the user cos t equals the sum of the net return of the durable (in equilibrium, the net return corresponds to what the consumer would obtain by not purchasing the asset and investing an equivalent amount of money on a competitive financial market) plus a possible capital gain: (5) =, +,+1,+1 Equation (5) shows that the user cost depends on the current price of the durable ,, on the current nominal interest rate , but also on expected capital gains, that is on the 12 Alternatively, the user cost can be derived by equating the price of a durable to the discounted value of the net benefits that it is expected to generate in the future. See Jorgenson (1963) and OECD (2009). 11 expected price of the durable at the end of period t. Thus, the user cost can be interpreted as an ex -ante measure of the consumption flow. In equation (5), and in the rest of this section, however, we do not distinguish between expected and actual prices. This amounts to assuming that the economy is in equilibrium and that the user cost is at the same time an ex ante and an ex post measure of the consumption flow . In equation (5), capital gains (or losses) depend on the economic depreciation of the durable and on the monetary price dynamics of durable goods. Economic depreciation is an expression used to describe the loss in monetary value that most capital goods experience with age [Hulten and Wykoff 1981]. Due to economic depreciation, one unit of the consumer durable of vintage v at the beginning of period t corresponds to (1) units of a durable of vintage v+1 at the beginning of the period t , where (0,1) is usually referred to as the net de preciation rate.13 At the same time, the price of one unit of a consumption durable of age v at the end of period t is equal to (1+),, where measures the durable -specific inflation rate in period t. It follows that +1,+1=(1)(1+),. Substituting in equation (5) we obtain: (6) =[+1(1)(1+)], If we assume 0, equation (6) simplifies to: 13 Hulten and Wykoff (1995) distinguish between \" deterioration\" and \"depreciation\". The former is a quantity concept while the latter refers to a financial value. Deaton and Zaidi (2002: 14) prefer to use the concept, and discuss a model for the \"deterioration rate\" based on the assumption that \" the quantity of the good is subject to \"radioactive decay\", so that if the household starts off the year with the amount S t, it will have an amount (1) to sell back at the end of the year\". This model corresponds to the geometric depreciation model that w e introduce in section 5.4.1. Hulten and Wykoff (1995), however observe that under the depreciation model the two concepts coincide. See also Koumanakos and Hwang (1988) 12 (7) =(+), where = is the Fisherian real interest rate. Equation (7) states that the user cost can be obtained by applying the sum of the real interest rate and the economic depreciation rate to the market price of an v-year old consumer durable in period t . Hence, according to the user cost approach, the coefficient ,() is simply : (8) ,()=+ where the argument \"u\" in ,() stands for \"user cost\". Equation ( 8) helps clarif y the relationship between the user cost and the rent equivalent approaches. The two approaches produce the same estimate of the consumption flow if and only if ,()=,(), i.e. if and only if: (9) =[+], Equation ( 9) states that the market rental value of the durable in a single period must be equal to the real rate of return that can be obtained by selling the durable and investing it on the capital market net of the depreciation rate of the durable. This is clearly an arbitrage condition that is only satisfied in equilibrium and in absence of any market friction [Jorgenson 1963, Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980]14. 14 Garner and Verbrugge (2007) find evidence on the empirical divergence between the two measures. 13 4 Discussion There are clear conceptual and theoretical differences between the three approaches reviewed in the previous section. The net acquisition approach is a stock approach, while the rent al equivalence and the user cost approaches are flow approaches . If we int erpret the consumer durable as a capital asset, the net acquisition approach consists in valuing both the present and future productive services of new \"capital\" by means of the purchasing market price of the durable. One advantage of this method is that i t treats durable goods symmetrically with non -durable consumption goods. The approach is also conceptually simple, easy to communicate and parsimonious in terms of data requirement (Diewert, 2004, 2009): its implementation only requires the market value of the durables purchased by the household in the survey period. A further advantage is its consistency with the prescriptions of SNA 2008 (SNA 2008). For all these reasons, most statisticians engaged in constructing consumer price indices adopt the acquisit ion approach for all durable goods (with the exception of housing ) [ILO 2003: 419]. There are, however, theoretical drawbacks that cannot be ignored. While the adoption of the acquisition approach might have a relatively little impact on the SNA, especiall y if the economy is on a steady state growth pattern 15, the same is not true for micro -level analyses . By imputing the entire value of the durable to the initial (acquisition) period the analyst clearly misrepresents the time pattern of the welfare accruing to the household that owns durable goods . The acquisition approach systematically overestimate s the living standards of households who decide to invest on new consumer durables, and underestimate it for 15 Diewert, (2004, 2002) prove that, in a long run equilibrium, the ratio between the value of the consumption flow estimated according to the user cost approach and the value estim ated following the acquisition approach is const ant and is, in general, larger than one. The ratio approximate the unity in a steady state growth pattern Jorgenson and Lanfeld (2006) note, however, that the distortion induced by the acquisition approach co uld also involve the aggregated level analysis. In a boost phase of the business cycle households tend to postpone investments on durables and the opposite is true in boom phases. Hence, the acquisition approach emphasizes the cycle givin g a large weight t o the more volatile component (sensitive to expectation) of households' consumption expenditure 14 households who decide to postpone this decision or have taken this decision in the past . While it is not easy to identify the direction and the magnitude of the bias, poverty and inequality estimates are certainly biased in the presence of durable goods imputed by means of the acquisitio n approach. The above discussion lead us to prefer the rental equivalence and the user cost approaches to the acquisition approach, at least in the context of welfare analysis. This is in line with the conclusions reached by Deaton and Zaidi (2002: 35), D iewert (2004, 2009), and more recently by the OECD Expert Group on Micro- statistics on Household Income, Consumption and Wealth (OECD, 2013). As shown in equation (9) , in an equilibrium position, the rental equivalence and the user cost approach are theor etically consistent. The rental equivalence approach uses the market evaluation ( observed paid rent) as an (ex ante) estimate of the user cost. If expectations are fulfilled , market rents can be considered as a good approximation of the user cost . There are however two problems . Firstly, if there is uncertainty , the hypothesis of perfect foresight may not be a plausible one16. In most situations, the rental equivalence approach is unlikely to converge to the user cost , due to departures from the theoretical conditions that must hold in order for equation (9) to hold true. Market rent al prices for durables are often sensitive to expectations and other cyclical factors . Secondly, we should consider certain data issues . For most v-year old durable goods , the availability of actual market rental prices is the exception rather then the rule. In most developing countries , markets for durable services are thin or even non existent and this makes the hypothesis of perfect foresight discussed sub 1) untenable . As appealing as the solution of asking households a self-assessment of durable rental prices might seem, the absence of reliable market data would not allow to test the reliability of the answers. 16 The question has been clearly pointed out, even if in a different context, by Hulten and Wykoff (1995): \"The rental price, on the other hand, is the ex ante cost of acquiring the right to use the capital good for a stipulated period of time. Under perfect foresight with full utilization the two concepts will tend to converge. With uncertainty, they may not\" 15 A combination of theoretical and data -related arguments leads us to express a preference for the user cost approach. Further, questionnaires used in many household budget surveys around the world contain useful information for implementing the user cost approach, irrespective of the choice of the welfare aggregat e (in particular, whether income - or expenditure based). All in all, the user cost provides the best balance between theoretical consistency and data requirement to properly account for durable goods in measuring welfare at the household level. PART II - PRACTICE In this section we focus on implementation issues, and in particular on how to estimate the consumption flow of consumer durable goods according to the user cost approach . The discussion cover s both data issues and estimation methods available to estimate the consumption flow as expressed in equation ( 7). We start off with an overview of how consumer durables are accounted for in living standard assessment reports around the world (section 5). Next we focus on the practicalities of how the consumption flow from durables can be estimated starting from the user cost approach (section 6) . 5 A bird's eye view of current practices We begin our review by summarizing the solutions adopted in selected World Bank Poverty Assessment Reports . We examined a sample comprising 95 reports published between 1996 and 2014, cover ing 61 countries. 17 We find that 43 percent of the reports fail 17 We excluded from the sample another 20 reports in which it was not possible figure out - with the due detail - the definition of the welfare aggregate. In most cases, our understanding is that durables were not accounted for. 16 to account for durable goods in the construction of the welfare aggregate : consumer durable goods are simply ignored and excluded from the welfare aggregate, no matter whether income - or expenditure based (Figure 1) . The reason underlying the exclusion of consumer durables is not necessarily a choice of the analyst . Oftentimes exclusion is a consequence of data limitation: not all questionnaires collect suitable information on consumer durables and their ownership. In other circumstances, durables are excluded due to the analyst's concern for making consistent intertemporal comparisons. This is the case, for instance , of Turkey in 2005 or of Egypt in 2011. Among the reports that do include consumer durables, almost one out of four follows the acquisition approach (Section 3.1). Figure 1 - Durable goods in World Bank's selected poverty assessment reports Source: Aut hors' elaboration 17 Regional practices matter. The choice of the method to deal with consumer durables tend to be common to countries belonging to the same region. The regions in which durable goods have been included in the welfare aggregate more frequently are Central Asia and Latin America (60%). In the MENA region, one out of two reports does account for durable goods, and does so by means of the acquisition approach. In contrast, in Central Asia and Latin America and Caribbean the user cost approach is the most popular method ( more than 70% of considered reports ). The user approach is also popular in East and South Asia (2 out of 3 reports account for durables ), but almost 6 out of 10 directly exclude durables from the welfare aggregate. Data constraints are particularly binding in Sub- Saharan Africa: only few reports include durables. Recently, an OECD exp ert group, chaired by Bob McCall from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, has released a report , part of a project launch in 2011, aimed at improving the measurement of living standards at the micro level, i.e. at the level of individuals and households. The new framework, named \"Framework for Statistics on the Distribution of Household Income, Consumption and Wealth\" (ICW Framework), takes advantage of the result obtained by a previous work, the Canberra Group Handbook on Household Income Statistics [Canb erra Group, 2011] , suggests a number of methodological innovations and does so by giving durable goods the due attention. According to the OECD report, consumer durables are to be accounted irrespective of whether using income or expenditure as a welfare measure. Beginning from income -based measures, the advocacy for including an estimated value of the flow of services of durables is clearly stated: \"As with owner -occupied housing, household consumer durables normally provide their owner with services over a number of years. The economic resource flowing to the owner is notionally the rental value of the durables less the costs such as maintenance expenses, depreciation and interest on any loan used to purchase the items. While similar in nature to the net value of owner -occupied housing, it is separated out because it is much more difficult to obtain relevant data, and because on average it is likely to have less impact on the micro data, although it may be significant for some sub- population analysis\". [OECD 2013: 46] Later on in the report, the estimated consumption flow from durables is 18 clearly listed among the components of income (code I3.3, \"Net value of services from household consumer durables\") [OECD 2013: table 4.1, p. 83 ]. Similarly, the concept of consumption expenditure developed within the ICW framework recognizes the need to account for durable goods: \"When a household purchases a dwelling or consumer durables, it does not normally consume them immediately. Rather, the household can be viewed as a producing entity that invests in those items as capital expenditure and provides a flow of services to itself as a consuming entity. In the ICW Framework, that flow of services is included as consumption expenditure, rather than the initial purchase o f the capital items. Two such service flows are included in the detailed framework: i) the value of housing services provided by owner -occupied housing and ii) the value of services from household consumer durables\" [OECD 2013: 105]. It is worth noting, however, that \"Any consumer durables (...) provided in kind to households as a return for labour or for the use of the household's property are included in income but not in consumption expenditure \" [OECD 2013: 106]. The country -level experience is variegated. We did not undertake an exhaustive review of the common practice in all countries, a task that goes beyond our scope here, but we chose a few countries , much depending on the accessibility of the websites where methodological notes are stored. Following no special order, here is a schematic account of our findings: In the US, consumer durable goods do not seem to receive any specific attention. The issue is mentioned in Citro and Michael (1995: 245), but only in passim. As a matter of fact, the consumption flow from durables is not part of the method used to estimate official poverty in the US. In Canada, there is no official government definition and therefore, measure, for poverty . The point is clearly stated in Fellegi (1997): \"Once governments establish a definition, Statistics Canada will endeavour to estimate the number of people who are poor according to that definition. Certainly that is a task in line with its mandate and its objective approach. In the meantime, Statistics Canada does not and cannot measure the level o f \"poverty\" in Canada.\" That said, Murphy et al. (2010, 2012) do not mention any special treatment reserved to consumer durables, and our understanding is that, de 19 facto, consumer durables do not enter the definition of total income used to measure poverty. In Australia, the income aggregate does not include any estimates of the service from consumer durables (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2013). With regards to the expenditure bas ed welfare aggregate, t he Australian practice has primarily hinged on the acquisition approach (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2012: 18- 20). In the UK, the income -based welfare aggregate does not include the consumption from durables [ Department for Work and Pensions, 2013]. In India, durables are included in the welfare aggregate according to the acquisition approach ( Government of India, 2007). Overall, in most countries, the current practice does not seem to be consistent with the lessons stemming from Part I of this paper, where it was argued that the user cost approach deserves the highest consideration as a way of includ ing consumer durables in the welfare aggregate. The recent OECD publication goes in the right direction in that it endorses the need of estimating the consumption flow of durables by means of a flow -based depreciation method. 6 The estimation of the consumption flow We begin from e quation ( 7), which we rewrite as follows : (10) =(+), Equation (10) contains four variables that must be estimated: 1) , the nominal interest rate; 20 2) , the durable -specific yearly inflation rate . Note that and jointly determine the real interest rate, =. 3) ,, the current market value of the v -year old durable ; 4) , the economic depreciation rate. In the rest of this section we discuss the information required to estimate each variable separately. This will bridge the gap between theory (eq. 1 0) and practice. 6.1 The nominal interest rate The nominal interest rate is determined in the capital market and is intended to measure the monetary financial opportunity cost of a household who decides to purchase (or not to sell) a durable good. In an economy with competitive markets there are many r eference interest rates. Moreover, financial assets may have different maturities and different degrees of risk. The equilibrium interest rates reflect all this complexity and even more 18. Which one, among the many available r ates, should the welfare analys t choose? There are many defensible answers and the final choice depends on the ultimate aim of the analysis, as well as on the institutional context. If one is willing to assume that risk aversion and wealth are negatively correlated19, then a good choice is the average interest rate on safe assets, e.g. the yields of government bonds. This type of information is typically available in most countries, and regularly published either by the national statistical office or by the central bank. A second possibility is to use the interest rates on loans, and specifically the borrowing rate on consumer durable goods like cars or other major durables 20. 18 For instance, also the heterogeneity in agents' expectations should be taken i nto account. Also, if one allows for imperfections in financial markets, different individuals might face different interest rates on loans. 19 Arrow (1971) was the first one who argued that absolute risk aversion decreases as wealth increases. 20 See Katz ( 1983) and Diewert (2009). 21 Concerning the time horizon there are two possibilities: 1) to adopt the sa me reference period of the estimated consumption flow (typically, one year); 2) to cover the average economic life of the durable good considered. Under the first alternative short period interest rates are considered, while in the second alternative use i s made of long -term rates. The second option is probably to be preferred to the first one, as it implies a lower volatility typically associated to long -term rates. Further, long -term rates allow to mitigate the effects of pure monetary fluctuations on ine quality and poverty trends. 6.2 The inflation rate The second variable in equation (10) is the annual rate of change of monetary price of the durable for which we want to measure the real financial opportunity cost . In theory, we are interested in a price index specific to each and every durable good acquired by the household. In practice, no such an index is likely to exist. Instead, it is common practice for analysts to rely on the general consumer price index (CPI)21. Accordingly, we can assume: (11) =1 1 Equation (11) implies that a CPI for the at least two years is available in order to identify the real interest rate in equation (10). 21 To the extent that the analysis is focused on poverty issues, it is advisable to refer to a cost of living index specific to poor households, that is, an index based on the consumption pattern of households belonging to the bottom deciles of the distribution of income and or expenditure. 22 6.3 The m arket value s of durable goods As discussed in Section 3, irrespective of the approach that we adopt, the consumption flow can be expressed as a fraction of the current market value of the durable ,. The monetary value , reflects the specific features of the durable good and the market conditions faced by the household who owns the durable. Unfortunately, most household budget survey s do not provide adequate information on ,. In this sense , it is useful to distinguish between the case when s = 0 (the durable good has been purchased by the household during the survey year) and s > 0 (the durable has been purchased prior to the survey year ). Typically, household budget survey s only record the price paid by the household to purchase a new durable good (no matter if p urchased on the second hand market)22, which is information that can be consistently used to estimate the market prices ,0. The survey questionnaire does not always report the market values of the durables purchased prior to the survey year. When this is the case, we must rely on indirect estimation method s for the market value , based on the price paid by the household, on price changes between t and t-s, and on estimates of the specific consumption durable depreciation rate. Households are often asked to report the hi storical price paid s years before the survey year for the purchase of the durable , which we denote with ,. Let denote the yearly durable specific inflation rate between t - s and t. The rate can be calculated by solving the equation (1++) =0 =(1+). By keeping constant the age of the durable, we can write: (12) ,=(1+), 22 Sometimes only the price paid for the durable good purchased more recently is reported. 23 The implementation of equation ( 12) requires the availability of the time series of some sort of price index for T=t-s-1,...,t . If, for instance, the durable good was purchased 10 years prior to the survey year (s = 10 ), the analyst need s the price indices for the past 11 years . Secondly, equation (12) provides an estimate of ,, that is , of the current value of a (v-s)-year old durable. However, the durable owned by the household is a v -year old durable. To estimate , we need to know the average yearly economic depreciation rate between age v - s and v . This is what we discuss in the next section. 6.4 The depreciation rate The depreciation rate measures the loss (or gain) in value that durable goods experience with age due to their physical deterioration and market value change. The depreciation pattern of a durable good can be represented in a general way. In order to simpl ify our discussion, we shall omit the index s , i.e. we will ignore the purchasing date of the durable23. Thus, we can write: (13) 1,=(11) 0, where 0, is the market value of a new durable in t and 1, is the market value of a 1- year old durable in t. The value 11 is the deterioration rate for the first year of life of the durable. Following the same notation, and with the same interpretation, we can also write: (14) 2,=(12) 1, 23 In the rest of this section we also assume that delta is unique, for each good, at the national level. In principle, one can explore the use of different deltas for different regions or population subgroups. To the best of our knowledge, these possibilities have not been discussed in the literature. 24 Equation (14) expresses the price of the durable good when it turns 2- year old, that is at the end of the second year , as a fraction of its value when it was 1 -year old. Substituting equation (13) in equation (14) we obtain: (15) 2,=(12)(11) 0, Proceeding iteratively one obtains : (16) ,=(1) =1 0, According to equation (16) the entire depreciation pattern of the durable good between t -v and t is described by the sequence {}=1. There are, obviously, many ways of characterizing this depreciation sequence and they all require different pieces of information to be implemented . We will here discuss the three most common model s that are found in the literature24: 1) the geometric depreciation model; 2) the straight line depreciation and 3) the \"light bulb\" depreciation. Further, w e will suggest a fourth depreciation model , a mixture of methods 1) and 3), which has the advantage of being parsimonious in terms of information requirement, and therefore potentially widely applicable . 6.4.1 The geometric depreciation model Under the geometric model the depreciation rate is assumed to be constant over time. In other words , a constant fraction of the value of the durable is lost every year . In equation (16) this implies that = for every i : 24 See Hulten and Wykoff (1981, 1996) and Diewert (2003, 2004, 2009) . 25 (17) ,=(1) 0, Equation (17) can be solved with respect to the (unique) depreciation rate : (18) =1, 0,1 In eq uation (18) the estimation of the depreciation rate only requires information on the market values of homogeneous durable goods of different age. Due to its analytical simplicity and its empirical robustness, the geometric model is one of the most popular model s25. 6.4.2 The straight line depreciation model The straight line depreciation model assume s that the economic life of the durable is finite and that its value follow s a linear pattern of depreciation. Let us denote with T the economic life of the durable : after T years its consumption flow equal s zero. According to the linear depreciation model we have: (19) , 0,= 0 25 See Hulten and Wykoff (1981, 1996) Jorgenson (1996) and Fraumeni (1997). The general conclusion of the empirical literature on the capital depreciation rate is that the geometric pattern is closer to the actual pattern than the patterns implied by the stra ight line and the light bulb depreciation model 26 Hence, it is straightforward to show that: (20) =1 < 1 where is the depreciation rate for the year i of the economic life of the durable good. Equation (20) shows that, unlike in the geometric depreciation method, the depreciation rate here is not constant over time. This implies that in order to implement the user cost formula we need to calculate a vintage- specific depreciation rate26. Also note t hat the implementation of the straight line depreciation model requires the knowledge of T, which requires an estimate of the economic life for each and every durable good owned by the households. Deaton and Zaidi (2002) assume that the age of the durable goods is uniformly distributed. Accordingly, 2 is an estimator of the maximum economic life of the durable, where is the average life of the durable calculated form the data recorded in the s urvey. An alternative consists in using some outlier -resist ant statistics computed over the set of the most long -lived goods in the sample: one possibility, for instance, is the 95th percentile of the sample distribution of the ages of the durable good. 6.4.3 The light bulb depreciation model The light bulb depreciatio n model, al so known as the \" one-hoss s hay\" model , is the simplest among the depreciation model s. The idea is that the durable maintains its efficiency and value along all its economic life and ceases to work, like a bulb, after T years. Accordingly, the consumption flow, as measured by the user cost, is constant over 26 For an application of the linear depreciation model see Diewert (2003). 27 the entire economic life of the durable. Let us define =/(1+) as the user cost of the durable evaluated at the beginning of period t. Equation (4) allows us to write : (21) =,+(1+) (1+)+1, If = is a constant for <, then equation (21) can be rewritten as follows: (22) ,=++1, where =(1+) (1+). We also assume <1, i.e. that the real interest rate is always strictly positive. Each durable goods maintains its efficiency for T periods and then cease s to function. Precisely at that time, ,=0. Substituting iteratively the RHS term in equation (22) we obtain: (23) ,=[1++2....+1]=1 1 By using equation (18) we obtain the final formula for the \"light bulb\" deprec iation rates: (23) =111 1 It should be observed that i n order to estimate the depreciation rate for the user cost formula we need to know the \"duration\" T of the durable , i.e. its economic life , and the parameter 28 that depends on the period t asset specific inflation rate and on the nominal interest rate . If we assume that is constant over time the depreciation r ate only varies with v, i.e. with the vintage of the durable27. 6.4.4 A mixture depreciation model In this section we introduce a depreciation model that can be obtained as a mixture of the geometric and light bulb depreciation models. The pure geometric depreciation model assumes that the value of the durable depreciates at a fixed rate , but the economic life of the durable never ends. In the new model, the key assumption is that durable goods depreciate at a constant rate , but the rate goes to one when >, where T denotes the maximum economic life of the durable. The question then is how to determine the scrap value of the durable, i.e. the value of the durable at v = T. One solution consists in assum ing that the scrap value , is a fraction <1 of the initial value 0,. (24) ,=0, The new parameter can be interpreted as a measure of the transaction cost for the durable ; is assumed here to be proportional to the initial value of the durable . The idea is that at the end of the economic life of the durable good the transaction costs absorb all the value of the durable. As a consequence, after T years the durable cannot be sold on the market without incurring in to a loss28. Substituting in equation (17) we obtain: 27 The pattern of the value of the durable can be easily calculated is given by ,=(11 )0,. 28 The actualized value of the residual consumption flows from the durable good (the reservation price) is less than the transacion cost that must be paid to purchase the durable. 29 (25) 0,=(1) 0, and s olving with respect to we can write: (26) =11 Equation (26) compares with equation (18). The advantage of equation ( 26) is that it does not require information on the current market prices of durable goods with different manufacturing years. This facilitates tremendously its implementation, both when data are relatively abundant, and even more so when the survey only provides an inventory of the durable goods owned by t he households. A drawback is that the estimate of the depreciation rate depends on the parameter , which is arbitrarily chosen by the analyst . In fact, it can be shown that the consumption flow from the durable is quite insensitive to choice of alpha. Equation (26) can be substituted in equation (10) and the elasticity of the consumption flow with respect to alpha can be easily calculated: (27) =1 +121 +11 =1 () where () is always less than one and is a decreasing function of . Hence the elasticity of the consumption flow with respect to is always less than one and tend s to zero as the age of the durable tends to in finity. To get a sense of the magnitude of , assume a conservative scenario where =2, =0.10 and =0.05; under this assumption the elasticity =0.28, that is a one percent increase in is associated with a 0.28 percent increase in the consumption flow. Ceteris paribus , if =25, =0.22. Again, the consumption flow is anelastic to . 30 Figure 2 - Depreciation models compared Source: our elaboration. Figure 2 compares the four depreciation models described in this section. On the vertical axis, the initial value of the durable good is normalized to one. We assume that the geometric depreciation rate is 10% and that the economic life T is equal to 25 years (emp irically, these are reasonable assumptions for many consumer durables). The dashed line describes the pattern of the straight line model, while the blue line describe s the pattern of the bulb light model. The geometric depreciation pattern is represented b y the black solid line. The green and the red lines describe the mixture model under the assumption that =5% and =10% , respectively. 31 6.4.5 Econometric model s A depreciation rate gives the percentage change of the market value of a durable good between two su bsequent years. In principle, depreciation rates can be calculated directly from the empirical age -price curves for each durable good. In practice, however , lack of adequate data prevent the analyst from drawing complete age profile s for most durable goods and, as a consequence, to estimate the required depreciation rates29. It is then necessary to estimate the age- price profile by using an econometric model. Studying the economic depreciation of capital assets Hulten and Whykoff (1981) introduced a n econo metric model that encompasses all the theoretical depreciation models described in sections 6.4.1- 6.4.330. Let be the observed market price of an asset of age in year . Then, the Box -Cox model for the used asset is: (28) =+++ where =11 1; =21 and Wykoff (1981a, 1981b), there is also a problem of c ensoring. The used price sample contains only the price of the \"survived\" durables and they provide a biased estimate of the average value of a specific vintage. A possible correction for censoring consists in multiplying the prices of surviving assets of each vintage by the age dependent probabilities of survival. Jorgenson (1996) shows that this correction has a relevant impact on depreciation rate estimates. Another possible source of bias depends on the fact that the equilibrium prices in second hand markets might be largely affected by adverse selection phenomena (Akerlof, 1970). 30 An alternative econometric model was proposed by Oliner (1993) who augmented the standard linear regression model with polynomial components for and . Micro -Economic Analysis Division of Canada (2007) has carried out a variety of other estimation exercises based on survival econometric models. 32 and (0,2). The parameter vector =(1,2,3) identifies the specific functional form of the Box -Cox power transformation that corresponds to the theoretical depreciation models discussed above. In particular, for =(0,1,1) equation (28) takes the semi -log form that corresponds to the geometric depreciation pattern31. When =(1,1,1) we obtain the linear depreciation pattern, while =(1,3,1) identifies the light bulb model. In the absence of reliable data on used asset prices , the assumption of a geometric depreciation pattern can be used to derive an alte rnative estimation procedure : (29) =+1 ; =0,1,.....,1 where is the vintage v asset price (we omit here the temporal index t ) and T is the expected economic life of the asset. From eq uation (29) we derive: (30) =+1 1 =0 Equation (30) can be rewritten as follows: (31) =+1 1 =0 = where DBR is known in the literature as the \"declining balance rate\". The larger is the expected service life T of the durable , the higher must be the declining balance rate 31 See also Jorgenson (1996) 33 consistent with a given geometric depreciation rate32. The idea o f the method is that of estimating directly DBR for all the assets for which there are reliable information on prices and then to use th ese estimates to calculate, by means of eq. (31), the depreciation rate for which there are only information about the expected economic life of the asset. This \"second best\" estimation procedure that was firstly proposed by Hulten and Wykoff (1981a, 1981b, 1996) is the one mainly adopted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to produce its official comprehensive table of depreciation rates33 (Fraumeni, 1997, BEA, 2003). 7 Conclusions The estimation of the value of the flow of services from durable goods is a relevant issue in many areas of economic analysis, from national accounting to price index theory , as well as in welfare analysis. In this paper the focus has been on the treatment that consumer durable goods must receive in the process of constructing a welfare aggregat e. The economic literature is relative ly abundant in theoretical studies focused on the economic depreciation of assets. The single most debated issue refers to the measurement of capital and investment decisions. In contrast, t he questions of economic dep reciation of consumer durable goods and the impact that different approaches have on the measurement of welfare at the individual - or household- level have remained largely unexplored issues. A general conclusion of the literature is that the user cost approach (section 3.3) is the most appropriate pricing concept to evaluat e the flow of services from durable assets . We also found a broad consensus on the fact that the geometric depreciation mode l (section 6.4.1) is the most empirically robust as well as theoretical ly consistent depreciation model for 32 Equation ( 31) is clearly an approximated formula. In t he geometric depreciation model there is no ending date for the capital asset. 33 According to the most recent BEA estimates, the DBR values range from 0.89 to 2.27 (www.bea.gov/national/pdf/BEA_depreciation_rates.pdf) . 34 capital asset s. Our analysis supports the fact that most of the advantages that hold true for capital goods, broadly defined, also hold true for consumer durable goods. Alternative approaches, like the acquisition approach or the rental equivalence approach, imply a higher risk of affecting in undesired ways the dis tribution of the welfare aggregate, and more generally welfare comparisons . The second finding, relating to the advantages of the geometric depreciation model, is more controversial for two reasons . The empirical evidence in favor of the geometric model i s based on capital asset s and not on consumer durable s. Extending the same line of argument to consumer durables is not straightforward. Secondly, the lack of adequate data is often responsible for insurmountable difficulties that prevent the analyst from estimating the geometric depreciation rate for consumer durable goods. We suggested a new depreciation model that preserves the basic structure of the geometric model , but relies on a more parsimonious set of statistical information. The main deficiency in the literature reviewed in this paper is that it fails to assess t he impact of the consumption flow from durable goods on the measurement of welfare and its distribution . We are not aware of studies that come up with an evaluation of the impact on poverty and inequality measures of including (excluding) the consumption flow in (from) the welfare aggregate. Nor are we aware of studies that report the sensitivity of the welfare distribution to different estimation method s of estimating the consumption flow. This adds uncertainty when it comes to advising on the \"best meth od\" to use in practice, and to design ing guidelines for the construction of the welfare aggregate. Further research is badly need ed in this area. 35 References Akerlof, G. (1970), The Market for Lemons, Quarterly Journal of Economics , 488- 500 Alchian, A. and B.

In particular, the data collection stage is a potential source of errors and of nonresponse.For instance, a respondent may give a wrong answer (intentionally or not),or no answer at all (either because he does not know the answer or becausehe does not want to answer the question). Errors and missing values can alsobe introduced later on, for instance when the data are transferred from theoriginal questionnaires to a computer system. The occurrence of nonresponseand, especially, errors in the observed data makes it necessary to carry out an extensive process of checking the collected data, and, when necessary, correcting them. This checking and correction process is referred to as ''statistical dataediting and imputation.'' In this book, we discuss theory and practical applications of statistical data editing and imputation; important topics for all institutes that produce surveydata, such as national statistical institutes (NSIs). In fact, it has been estimated that NSIs spend approximately 40% of their resources on editing and imputingdata. Any improvement in the efciency of the editing and imputation processshould therefore be highly welcomed by NSIs. Besides NSIs, other producersof statistical data, such as market researchers, also apply edit and imputation techniques. The importance of statistical data editing and imputation for NSIs and academic researchers is reflected by the sessions on statistical data editing andimputation that are regularly organized at international conferences on statistics. The United Nations consider statistical data editing to be such an importanttopic they organize a so-called work session on statistical data editing every 18months. This work session, well-attended by experts from all over the world,addresses modern techniques for statistical data editing and imputation anddiscusses its practical applications. As far as we are aware, this is the rst book to treat statistical data editing in detail. Existing books treat statistical data editing only a secondary topic, and thediscussion of statistical data editing is limited to just a few pages. In this book,statistical data editing is a main topic, and we discuss both general theoreticalresults and practical applications. The other main topic of this book is imputation. Since several well-known books on imputation of missing data are available, this raises the question whywe deemed a further treatment of imputation in this book useful. We can give ixx Preface two reasons. First, in practice\u2014in any case in practice at NSIs\u2014statistical data editing and imputation are often applied in combination. In some cases it is even hard to point out where the detection of errors ends and where imputation of better values starts. This is, for instance, the case for the so-called Nearest- neighbor Imputation Methodology discussed in Chapter 4. It would therefore be somewhat contrived to reserve attention only to data editing and leave out a discussion of imputation methods altogether. The second reason why we have included imputation as a topic in this book is that data often have to satisfy certain consistency rules, the so-called edit rules. In practice it is quite common that imputed values have to satisfy at least some consistency rules. However, as far as we are aware, no other book on imputation examines this particular topic. NSIs and other producers of statistical data generally apply ad hoc operations to adapt the imputation methods described in the literature so imputed data will satisfy the edit rules. We hope that our book will be a valuable guide to applying more advanced imputation methods that can take edit rules into account. In fact a close connection exists between statistical data editing and imputa- tion. Statistical data editing is used to detect erroneous data and imputation is used to correct these data. During these processes often the same edit rules are applied, i.e., the same consistency checks that are used to detect errors in the original data must be satised by the imputed data later on. We feel that this close connection between statistical data editing and imputation merits one book describing both topics. The intended audience of this book consists of researchers at NSIs and other data producers, and students at universities. Since the overall aim of bothstatistical data editing and imputation is to obtain data of high statistical quality, the book obviously treats many statistical topics, and is therefore primarily ofinterest to students and experts in the eld of (mathematical) statistics. Some readers might be surprised to nd that the book also treats topics from operations research, such as optimization algorithms, as well as some techniques from general mathematics. However, an interest in these topics arises quite naturally from the problems that we discuss. An important example is the problem of nding the erroneous values in a record of data that does not satisfy certain edit rules. This so-called error localization problem can be cast as a mathematical programming problem, which may then be solved using techniques from operations research. Another example concerns the adjustment of data to attain consistency with edit rules or with data from other sources (benchmarking). These problems too can be cast as mathematical programming problems. Broadly speaking, applications of operations research techniques frequently occur in the chapters on statistical data editing, whereas the chapters on imputation are of a more statistical nature. Some parts of the material on statistical data editing (Chapters 2 to 6 and 10) may therefore be more appealing to students and experts in operations research or general mathematics rather than to students and experts in the eld of statistics.Preface xi Acknowledgments There are many people who have at some point contributed to this book, often without being aware of this at the time. We would like to thank all studentsfrom several Dutch universities who did an internship on statistical data editing or imputation at Statistics Netherlands, all former and current colleagues at Statistics Netherlands we had the plea sure of collaborating with on these topics, and all colleagues at universities and statistical institutes around the world wehave worked with in international research projects or met at one of the work sessions on statistical data editing. It has been a privilege for us to work with, and get to know, all of you. There are too many people we would like to thank to name all of them here, at least not without expanding this book to twice its current size. We restrict ourselves to naming a few of them. We would like to thank Jacco Daalmans, Jeffrey Hoogland, Abby Isra \u00a8els, Mark van der Loo, and Caren Tempelman, for collaborating with us over the years on many practical applications of statisticaldata editing and imputation at Statistics Netherlands. The experiences gathered from all these projects have somehow made their way into this book. We should also mention that Caren Tempelman's Ph.D. thesis on imputation methods forrestricted data, which she wrote while working at Statistics Netherlands, was awonderful source of material for Chapter 9. We also would like to thank co-authors of several articles that form the basis of some chapters in this book: Ronan Quere, Marco Remmerswaal, andespecially Wieger Coutinho and Natalie Shlomo. We want to thank a few people who have been more directly involved with this book. Firstly, we want to thank Natalie Shlomo again. This time forcarefully identifying errors and occurrences of missing data in an early version ofthe manuscript. Your remarks left us with many imputations to carry out, butthey have only improved the contents of this book. Any errors that remain are of course entirely our fault. We also want to thank the staff at John Wiley & Sons, especially Jackie Palmieri and Lisa Van Horn, for giving us the opportunity towrite this book in the rst place, and for always reminding us of approaching deadlines. Without you this book would never have been nished. Finally, we want to thank our families for their support and love. Ton de Waal Jeroen Pannekoek Sander Scholtus The Hague, The Netherlands August 2010One Chapter Introduction to Statistical Data Editingand Imputation 1.1 Introduction It is the task of National Statistica l Institutes (NSIs) and other ofcial statistical institutes to provide high-quality statistical information on many aspects of society, as up-to-date and as accurately as possible. One of the difculties in performing this task arises from the fact that the data sources that are used for theproduction of statistical output, both traditional surveys as well as administrativedata, inevitably contain errors that may influence the estimates of publication gures. In order to prevent substantial bias and inconsistencies in publicationgures, NSIs therefore carry out an extensive process of checking the collecteddata and correcting them if necessary. This process of improving the data qualityby detecting and correcting errors encompasses a variety of procedures, both manual and automatic, that are referred to as statistical data editing . The effects of statistical data editing on the errors have been examined since the mid-1950s [see Nordbotten (1955)]. Besides errors in the data, another complicating factor in order to fulll the task of NSIs and other statistical institutes successfully is that data are oftenmissing. This can be seen as a simple form of erroneous data, simple in the sensethat missing values are easy to identify; estimating good values for these missing values may, however, be hard.

Errors arise during the measurement process when the reported values differ from the true values. A possible reason for a measurement error can be that the true valueis unknown to the respondent or difcult to obtain. Another reason could bethat questions are misinterpreted or misread by the respondent. An example isthe so-called unity measurement error that occurs if the respondent reports ineuros when it was required to report in thousands of euros. Another example isa respondent reporting his own income when asked for the household income.For business surveys, errors also occur due to differences in denitions used bythe statistical ofce and the accounting system of the responding unit. There may, for instance, be differences in the reference period used by the business and the requested period (nancial year versus calender year is an example). Afterthe data have been collected, they will pass through several other processes, suchas keying, coding, editing, and imputation. Errors that arise during this furtherprocessing are referred to as processing errors. Note that although the purposeof editing is to correct errors, it is mentioned here also as a process that mayoccasionally introduce errors. This undesirable situation arises if an item value isadjusted because it appeared to be in error but it is actually correct. Missing datacan arise when a respondent does not know the answer to a question or refusesto give the answer to a certain question. Traditionally, NSIs have always put a lot of effort and resources into statistical data editing, because they considered it a prerequisite for publishing accuratestatistics. In traditional survey processing, statistical data editing was mainly an interactive activity intended to correct all data in every detail. Detected errors or inconsistencies were reported and explained on a computer screen and correctedafter consulting the questionnaire or contacting respondents, which are time-and labor-intensive procedures. In this book we examine more efcient statisticaldata editing methods. It has long been recognized that it is not necessary to correct all data in every detail. Several studies [see, for example, Granquist (1984, 1997) and Granquistand Kovar (1997)] have shown that in general it is not necessary to removeall errors from a data set in order to obtain reliable publication gures. Themain products of statistical ofces are tables containing aggregate data, whichare often based on samples of the population. This implies that small errors inindividual records are acceptable. First, because small errors in individual recordstend to cancel out when aggregated. Second, because if the data are obtained from a sample of the population, there will always be a sampling error in the published gures, even when all collected data are completely correct. In thiscase an error in the results caused by incorrect data is acceptable as long as it issmall in comparison to the sampling error. In order to obtain data of sufcientlyhigh quality, it is usually enough to remove only the most influential errors.The above-mentioned studies have been conrmed by many years of practicalexperience at several statistical ofces. In the past, and often even in the present, too much effort was spent on correcting errors that did not have a noticeable impact on the ultimately publishedgures. This has been referred to as ''over-editing.'' Over-editing not only costs1.1 Introduction 3 money, but also takes a considerable amount of time, making the period between data collection and publication unnecessarily long. Sometimes over-editing evenbecomes ''creative editing''; the editing process is then continued for such alength of time that unlikely, but correct, data are ''corrected.'' Such unjustiedalterations can be detrimental for data qua lity. For more about the danger of over-editing and creative editing, see, for example, Granquist (1995, 1997) and Granquist and Kovar (1997). It has been argued that the role of statistical data editing should be broader than only error localization and correction. Granquist (1995) identies the following main objectives: 1.Identify error sources in order to provide feedback on the entire survey process. 2.Provide information about the quality of the incoming and outgoing data. 3.Identify and treat influential errors and outliers in individual data. 4.When needed, provide complete and consistent individual data. During the last few years, the rst two goals\u2014providing feedback on the other survey phases, such as the data collection phase, and providing information on the quality of the nal results\u2014have gained in importance. The feedback on other survey phases can be used to improve those phases and reduce the amountof errors arising in these phases. In the next few years the rst two goals of dataediting are likely to become even more important. The main focus in this bookis, however, on the latter, more traditional, two goals of statistical data editing.Statistical data editing is examined in Chapters 2 to 6. Missing data is a well-known problem that has to be faced by basically all institutes that collect data on persons or enterprises. In the statistical literature, ample attention is hence paid to missing data. The most common solutionto handle missing data in data sets is imputation, where missing values are estimated and lled in. An important problem of imputation is to preserve the statistical distribution of the data set. This is a complicated problem, especiallyfor high-dimensional data. Chapters 7 and 8 examine this aspect of imputation. At NSIs the imputation problem is further complicated owing to the existence of constraints in the form of edit restrictions, or edits for short, thathave to be satised by the data. Examples of such edits are that the prot andthe costs of an enterprise have to sum up to its turnover and that the turnoverof an enterprise should be at least zero. Records that do not satisfy these editsare inconsistent and are hence considered incorrect. Details about imputationand adjustment techniques that ensure t hat edits are satised can be found in Chapters 9 and 10. The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. In Section 1.2 we examine the statistical process at NSIs and other statistical organizations, and especially the role that statistical data editing and imputation play in this process. InSection 1.3 we examine (kinds of) data, errors, missing data, and edits. Section1.4 briefly describes the editing methods that will be explored in more detaillater in this book. Finally, Section 1.5 concludes this chapter by describing abasic editing strategy.4 CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Statistical Data Editing and Imputation 1.2 Statistical Data Editing and Imputation in the Statistical Process 1.2.1 OVERVIEW OF THE STATISTICAL PROCESS The processes of detecting and correcting errors and handling missing data form a part of the process of producing statistical information as practiced at NSIs.This process of producing statistical information can be broken down into anumber of steps. Willeboordse (1998) distinguishes the following phases in the statistical process for business surveys: Setting survey objectives. Questionnaire design and sampling design. Data collection and data entry. Data processing and data analysis. Publication and data dissemination. A similar division can be made for social surveys. Each phase itself can be subdivided into several steps. Setting Survey Objectives. In the rst phase, user groups for the statisti- cal information under consideration are identied, user needs are assessed, available data sources are explored, potential respondents are consulted about their willingness to cooperate, the survey is embedded in the gen-eral framework for business surveys, the target population and the targetvariables of the intended output are specied, and the output table is designed. Questionnaire Design and Sampling Design. In the second phase the potential usefulness of available administrative registers is determined, the frame population in the so-called Statistical Business Register is compared with the target population, the sampling frame is dened, the sampling design and estimation method are selected, and the questionnaire is designed. Thereis a decision process on how to collect the data: paper questionnaires, personalinterviews, telephone interviews, or electronic data interchange. Data Collection and Data Entry. In the third phase the sample is drawn, data are collected from the sampled units and entered into the com- puter system at the statistical ofce. During this phase the statistical ofce tries to minimize the response burden for businesses and to minimize nonresponse. Data Processing and Data Analysis. In the fourth phase the collected data are edited, missing and erroneous data are imputed, raising weights are determined, population gures are estimated, the data are incorporatedin the integration framework, and the data are analysed (for example,to adjust for seasonal effects). The process of detecting and correcting1.2 Statistical Data Editing and Imputation in the Statistical Process 5 errors and handling missing data forms an important part of this phase. The bulk of the work at NSIs and other statistical agencies that col- lect and process data is spent on this phase, especially on statistical data editing. Publication and Data Dissemination. The nal phase includes setting out a publication and dissemination strategy, protecting the nal data (both tabular data and microdata, i.e. the data of individual respondents) against disclosure of sensitive information, and lastly publication of the protected data. 1.2.2 THE EDIT AND IMPUTATION PROCESS During statistical data editing and the imputation process, erroneous records\u2014and erroneous values within these records\u2014are localized and new values are estimated for the erroneous values and values missing in the data set.To edit an erroneous record, two steps have to be carried out. First, the incorrectvalues in such a record have to be localized. This is often called error localization . Second, after the faulty elds in an erroneous record have been identied, thesefaulty elds have to be imputed ; that is, the values of these elds have to be replaced by better, preferably the correct, values. For erroneous records, error localization and imputation are closely related. Often it is hard to distinguish where the error localization phase ends and where the imputation phase starts. For instance, when humans edit data, they frequently look at possible ways of imputing a record before completing the errorlocalization phase. Another example is that the localization of erroneous valuesmight be based on estimating values rst and then determining the deviation between the observed and estimated values. The observed values that differ most from their estimated counterparts are then considered erroneous, or in any casesuspicious. In this approach the detection of erroneous values and the estimationof better values are highly intertwined. A third example is that during manualreview (see Chapter 6) the detection of erroneous values and the ''estimation'' of better values are highly intertwined. This ''estimation'' often simply consists of lling in correct answers obtained by recontacting the respondents. Despitethe fact that error localization and imputation can be closely related, we willtreat them as two separate processes throughout most of this book. This is a simplication of the edit and imputation problem, but one that has shown to work well for most cases arising in practice. In principle, it is not necessary to impute missing or erroneous values in order to obtain valid estimates for the target variables. Instead, one can estimate thetarget variables directly during an estimation phase, without imputing the missing and erroneous values rst. However, this approach would in most practical cases become extremely complex and very demanding from a computational point ofview. By rst imputing the missing and erroneous values, a complete data set isobtained. From this complete data set, estimates can be obtained by standard estimation methods. In other words, imputation is often applied to simplify the estimation process.6 CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Statistical Data Editing and Imputation 1.3 Data, Errors, Missing Data, and Edits 1.3.1 KINDS OF DATA Edit and imputation techniques can be divided into two main classes, depending on the kind of data to be edited or imputed: techniques for numerical data andtechniques for categorical data. Generally, there are major differences between techniques for these kinds of data. At NSIs and other statistical institutes, numerical data occur mainly in surveys on businesses whereas categorical dataoccur mainly in social surveys\u2014for instance, surveys on persons or households. At Statistics Netherlands and other NSIs, editing of business surveys is a much bigger problem than editing of most social surveys on households and persons. The main reason is that for business surveys, generally much more edit rules (see below) are dened than for social surveys, and business surveys generallycontain much more errors than social surveys. Typically, business surveys are not very large. Large and complicated business surveys may have somewhat over 100 variables and 100 edits. In a small country such as the Netherlands, the number of records in a business survey is usually a few thousand. Population censuses form an important exception to the general rule that editing is easier for social surveys than for business surveys. Census data do notcontain a high percentage of errors, but the number of edits (a few hundred), the number of variables (a few hundred), and especially the number of records can be high (several millions). Due to the sheer volume of the data, editing of data from a population census forms a major problem. The only efcient way to edit such volumes of data is to edit these data in an automatic manner wheneverpossible. A recent development at NSIs is the increasing use of administrative (or register-based) data, as opposed to the more traditional data collection by meansof sample surveys. The editing and imputation of administrative data for statistical purposes has certain specic features not shared by sample surveys. For instance, if data from several registers are combined, apart from the errors that are presentin the individual registers, additional inconsistencies may occur between data from different registers due to matching errors or diverging metadata denitions. Because this is a relatively new topic, suitable methodology for the statistical dataediting and imputation of administrative data has not yet been fully developed. We refer to Wallgren and Wallgren (2007) for an overview of current methods for register-based statistics. 1.3.2 KINDS OF ERRORS One of the important goals of statistical data editing is the detection and correctionof errors. Errors can be subdivided in several ways. A rst important distinction we shall make is between systematic and random errors. A second important distinction we shall make is between influential errors and noninfluential errors. The nal distinction is between outliers and nonoutliers.1.3 Data, Errors, Missing Data, and Edits 7 Systematic Errors. A systematic error is an error that occurs frequently between responding units. This type of error can occur when a respondent misunderstands or misreads a survey question. A well-known type of systematicerror is the so-called unity measure error, which is the error of, for example,reporting nancial amounts in euros instead of the requested thousands ofeuros. Systematic errors can lead to substantial bias in aggregates. Once detected,systematic errors can easily be corrected because the underlying error mechanismis known. Systematic errors, such as unity measure errors, can often be detected by comparing a respondent's present values with those from previous years,by comparing the responses to questionnaire variables with values of registervariables, or by using subject-matter knowledge. Other systematic errors, suchas transpositions of returns and costs and redundant minus signs, can bedetected and corrected by systematically exploring all possible transpositionsand inclusions/omissions of minus signs. Rounding errors\u2014a class of systematicerrors where balance edits (see Section 1.3.4) are violated because the values ofthe involved variables have been rounded\u2014can be detected by testing whetherfailed balance edits can be satised by slightly changing the values of the involvedvariables. We treat systematic errors in more detail in Chapter 2. Random Errors. Random errors are not caused by a systematic deciency, but by accident. An example is an observed value where a respondent by mistaketyped in a digit too many. In general statistics, the expectation of a random erroris typically zero. In our case, however, the expectation of a random error may alsodiffer from zero. This is, for instance, the case in the above-mentioned example. Random errors can result in outlying values. In such a case they can be detected by outlier detection techniques or by selective editing techniques (seeChapter 6). Random errors can also be influential (see below), in which casethey may again be detected by selective editing techniques. In many cases,random errors do not lead to outlying values or influential errors. In such cases,random errors can often be corrected automatically, assuming that they do leadto violated edit restrictions. Automatic editing of random errors is treated indetail in Chapters 3 to 5. Influential Errors. Errors that have a substantial influence on publication gures are called influential errors. They may be detected by selective editingtechniques (see Chapter 6). The fact that a value has a substantial influence on publication gures does not necessarily imply that this value is erroneous. It may also be a correctvalue. In fact, in business surveys, influential observations are quite common,because many variables of businesses, such as turnover and costs, are often highlyskewed. Outliers. A value, or a record, is called an outlier if it is not tted well by a model that is posited for the observed data. If a single value is an outlier, this is called aunivariate outlier. If an entire record, or at least a subset consisting of several values8 CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Statistical Data Editing and Imputation in a record, is an outlier when the values are considered simultaneously\u2014that is, if they do not t the posited model well when considered simultaneously\u2014thisis called a multivariate outlier. Again we have that the mere fact that a value (or a record) is an outlier does not necessarily imply that this value (set of values) contains an error. It may also be a correct value (set of values). Outliers are related to influential values. An influential value is often also an outlier, and vice versa. However, an outlier may also be a noninfluentialvalue and an influential value may also be a nonoutlying value. In the statisticalediting process, outliers are often detected during so-called macro-editing (seeChapter 6). In this book we do not examine general outlier detection techniques,except for a very brief discussion in Chapter 3. We refer to the literature fordescriptions of these techniques [see, e.g., Rousseeuw and Leroy (1987), Barnett and Lewis (1994), Rocke and Woodruff (1996), Chambers, Hentges and Zhao (2004), and Todorov, Templ, and Filzmoser (2009)]. 1.3.3 KINDS OF MISSING DATA The occurrence of missing data implies a reduction of the effective samplesize and consequently an increase in the standard error of parameter estimates.This loss of precision is often not the main problem with nonresponse. Surveyorganizations can anticipate the occurrence of nonresponse by oversampling,and moreover the loss of precision can be quantied when standard errors areestimated. A more problematic effect, which cannot be measured easily, is thatnonresponse may result in biased estimates. Missing data can be subdivided in several ways according to the underlying nonresponse mechanism. Whether the problem of biased estimates due to non- response actually occurs will depend on the nonresponse mechanism. Informally speaking, if the nonresponse mechanism does not depend on unobserved data(conditionally on the observed data), imputation may lead to unbiased estimateswithout making further assumptions. If the nonresponse mechanism does dependon unobserved data, then further\u2014unveriable\u2014assumptions are necessary toreduce bias by means of imputation. We shall now make these statements moreprecise. A well-known and very often used classication ''not missing at random'' (NMAR); see Rubin (1987), Schafer (1997), and Little and Rubin (2002). MCAR. When missing data are MCAR, the probability that a value is missing does not depend on the value(s) of the target variable(s) to be imputed or onthe values of auxiliary variables. This situation can occur when a respondentforgets to answer a question or when a random part of the data is lost while processing it. MCAR is the simplest nonresponse mechanism, because the item nonrespondents (i.e., the units that did not respond to the target variable) aresimilar to the item respondents (i.e., the units that did respond to the target1.3 Data, Errors, Missing Data, and Edits 9 variable). Under MCAR, the observed data may simply be regarded as a random subset of the complete data. Unfortunately, MCAR rarely occurs in practice. More formally, a nonresponse mechanism is called MCAR if P(r j|yj,x,)=P(r j|). (1.1) In this notation, rjis the response indicator of target variable yj,w h e r e rij=1 means that record icontains a response for variable yj,a n d rij=0 that the value of variable yjis missing for record i,xis a vector of always observed auxiliary variables, and is a parameter of the nonresponse mechanism. MAR. When missing data are MAR, the probability that a value is missing does depend on the values of auxiliary variables, but not on the value(s) of the target variable(s) to be imputed. Within appropriately dened groups ofpopulation units, the nonresponse mechanism is again MCAR. This situationcan occur, for instance, when the nonresponse mechanism of elderly peoplediffers from that of younger people, but within the group of elderly people andthe group of younger people the probability that a value is missing does notdepend on the value(s) of the target variable(s) or on the values of other auxiliaryvariables. Similarly, for business surveys, larger businesses may exhibit a differentnonresponse mechanism than small businesses, but within each group of largerbusinesses, respectively small businesses, the nonresponse mechanism may be MCAR. In more formal terms, a nonresponse mechanism is called MAR if P(r j|yj,x,)=P(r j|x,), (1.2) using the same notation as in (1.1). MAR is a more complicated situation than MCAR. In the case of MAR, one needs to nd appropriate groups of population units to reduce MAR to MCAR for these groups. Once these groups of population units have been found, it issimple to correct for missing data because within these groups all units may beassumed to have the same probability to respond. In practice, one usually assumes the nonresponse mechanism to be MAR and tries to construct appropriate groups of population units. These groups arethen used to correct for missing data. NMAR. When missing data are NMAR, the probability that a value is missing does depend on the value(s) of the target variable(s) to be imputed, and possiblyalso on the values of auxiliary variables. This situation can occur, for instance,when reported values of income are more likely to be missing for persons with ahigh income, when the value of ethnicity is more likely to be missing for certainethnic groups, or\u2014for business surveys\u2014when the probability that the value ofturnover is missing depends on the value of turnover itself.10 CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Statistical Data Editing and Imputation In more formal terms, a nonresponse mechanism is called NMAR if P(r j|yj,x,) cannot be simplied, that is, if both (1.1) and (1.2) do not hold. NMAR is the most complicated case. In order to correct for NMAR, one cannot use only the observed data. Instead, one also has to make model assumptions in order to model the dependence of the nonresponse mechanismon the value(s) of the target variable(s). is: Ignorable. A nonresponse mechanism is called ignorable if it is MAR (or MCAR) and the parameters to be estimated are distinct from the parameter. Here, distinctness means that knowledge of (which could be inferred from the response indicator r jthat is available for all units, responding or not) is not helpful in estimating the parameters of interest. However, asnoted by Little and Rubin (2002, Chapter 6), the MAR condition is more important than distinctness, because MAR alone is sufcient to make valid inference possible. If the parameters are not distinct, this can merely resultin some loss of efciency. Nonignorable. A nonresponse mechanism is called nonignorable if the conditions for ignorability do not hold. That is, either the nonresponse mechanism is NMAR or the parameter is not distinct from the parameters of interest, or both. For more details on MCAR, MAR, NMAR, and (non-)ignorability we refer toRubin (1987), Schafer (1997), and Little and Rubin (2002). 1.3.4 EDIT RULES Errors are most often detected by edit rules. Edit rules, or edits for short, denethe admissible (or plausible) values and combinations of values of the variablesin each record. Errors are detected by verifying whether the values are admissibleaccording to the edits\u2014that is, by checking whether the edits are violated orsatised. An edit ecan be formulated as e:xS x, with Sxthe set of admissible values of x.A sw es h a l ls e eb e l o w , xcan refer to a single variable as well as multiple variables. If eis false, the edit is violated and otherwise the edit is satised. Edits can be divided into hard (orfatal)e d i t sa n d soft(orquery )e d i t s .H a r d edits are edits that must be satised in order for a record to qualify as a validrecord. As an example, a hard edit for a business survey species that the variableTotal costs needs to be equal to the sum of the variables Employee costs ,Capital costs,Transport costs ,a n d Other costs . Records that violate one or more hard edits1.3 Data, Errors, Missing Data, and Edits 11 are considered to be inconsistent and it is deduced that some variable(s) in such a record must be in error. Soft edits are used to identify unlikely or deviatingvalues that are suspected to be in error, although this is not a logical necessity. Examples are (a) an edit specifying that the yearly income of employees must be less than 10 million euros or (b) an edit specifying that the turnover peremployee of a rm may not be larger than 10 times the value of the previous year. The violation of soft edits can be a trigger for further investigation of these edit failures, to either conrm or reject the suspected values. To illustrate the kind of edits that are often applied in practice, examples of a number of typical classes of edits are given below. Univariate Edits or Range Restrictions. An edit describing the admissible values of a single variable is called a univariate edit or a range restriction. Forcategorical variables, a range restriction simply veries whether the observed category codes for the variable belong to the specied set of codes. The set of allowable values S xis Sx={ x1,x2,...,xC} and consists of an enumeration of the Callowed codes. For instance, for the variable Sexwe could have Sx={0, 1} and for a date variable in the conventional yyyy-mm-dd notation the set Sxwould consist of all allowed integer combinations describing the year, month, and day. Range restrictions for continuous variables are usually specied using inequalities. The simplest, but often encountered, range restrictions of this type are nonnegativity constraints, that is, Sx={ x|x0}. Examples are Age,Rent, and many of the nancial variables in business surveys (costs of various types, turnover and revenues of various activities and so on).Range restrictions describing an interval as S x={ x|lxu} are also common. Examples are setting lower ( l) and upper ( u)b o u n d so nt h e allowable values of age, income, or working hours per week. Range restrictions can be hard edits (for instance, if Sxis an enumeration of allowable codes), but they can also be soft edits if the bounds set on the allowable range are not a logical necessity (for instance, if the maximum number of weekly working hours is set to 100). Bivariate Edits. In this case the set of admissible values of a variable xdepends on the value of another variable, say y, observed on the same unit. The set of admissible values is then the set of admissible pairs of values ( x,y). For instance, ifxisMarital status with values 0 (never married), 1 (married) and 2 (previously married) and yisAge, we may have that Sxy={(x,y)|x=0y<15}{ (x,y)|y15},12 CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Statistical Data Editing and Imputation reflecting the rule that persons younger than 15 are not allowed to be married, while for persons of 15 years or more all marital states are allowed. Another example of a bivariate edit is Sxy={(x,y)|xy>14}, with xthe age, in years, of a mother and ythe age of her child. This example reflects the perhaps not ''hard'' edit that a mother must be at least 14 years older than her child. Finally, an important and often encountered class of bivariate e d i t si st h es o - c a l l e d ratio edit which sets bounds on the allowable range of a ratio between two variables and is dened by Sxy={(x,y)|lx yu}. A ratio edit could, for example, specify bounds on the ratio of the turnover andthe number of employees of rms in a certain branch of industry. Ratio edits are often used to compare data on the same units from different sources, such as values reported in the current survey ( x) with values for the same variables reported in last year's survey (y ) or values of variables from a tax register with similarly dened variables from a survey. Balance Edits. Balance edits are multivariate edits that state that the admissible values of a number of variables are related by a linear equality. They occur mainly in business statistics where they are linear equations that should be satisedaccording to accounting rules. Two examples are Prot=Turnover Total costs (1.3) and Total costs =Employee costs +Other costs . (1.4)These rules are related because they have the variable Total costs in common. If the rst rule is satised but the second is not, it may seem more likely that Employee costs orOther costs are in error than Total costs , because in the last case the rst rule should probably also be violated. Balance edits are of great importance for editing economic surveys where there are often a large numberof such edits. For instance, in the yearly structural business statistics there are typically about 100 variables with 30 or more balance edits. These interrelated systems of linear relations that the val ues must satisfy provide much information about possible errors and missing values. Since balance edits describe relations between many variables, they are multivariate edits. Moreover, since they are often connected by common variables,they should be treated as a system of linear equations. It is convenient to express such a system in matrix notation. Denoting the ve variables in (1.3) and (1.4)1.4 Basic Methods for Statistical Data Editing and Imputation 13 byx1(Prot ),x2(Turnover ),x3(Total costs ),x4(Employee costs ), and x5(Other costs), the system can be written as /parenleftbigg 111 0 values of a vector xsubject to a system of balance edits, dened by a restriction matrix A, can then be written as Sx={x|Ax=0}. 1.4 Basic Methods for Statistical Data Editing and Imputation In this section we have a rst brief look at various methods that can be used toedit and impute data. Before we sketch these methods, we rst look back to seewhy these methods were developed. Computers have been used in the editing process for a long time [see, e.g., Nordbotten (1963)]. In the early years their role was, however, restrictedto checking which edits were violated. Subject-matter specialists entered datainto a mainframe computer. Subsequently, the computer checked whether thesedata satised all specied edits. For each record all violated edits were listed. Subject-matter specialists then used these lists to correct the records. That is, they retrieved all paper questionnaires that did not pass all edits and corrected thesequestionnaires. After they had corrected the data, these data were again enteredinto the mainframe computer, and the computer again checked whether the datasatised all edits. This iterative process was continued until (nearly) all records passed all edits. A major problem of this approach was that during the manual correction process the records were not checked for consistency. As a result, a record that was ''corrected'' could still fail one or more specied edits. Such a record hencerequired more correction. It was not exceptional that some records had to be corrected several times. It is therefore not surprising that editing in this way was very costly, both in terms of money as well as in terms of time. In the literatureit was estimated that 25% to 40% of the total budget was spent on editing [seee.g. Federal Committee on Statistical Methodology (1990) and Granquist andKovar (1997)]. 1.4.1 EDITING DURING THE DATA COLLECTION PHASE The most efcient editing technique of all is no editing at all, but instead ensuringthat correct data are obtained during the data collection phase. In this section webriefly discuss ways to obtain data with no or only few errors at data collection.14 CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Statistical Data Editing and Imputation When one aims to collect correct data at data collection, one generally uses a computer to record the data. This is called computer-assisted data collection. With computer-assisted data collection the computer can immediately check therecorded data for violations of edits. Below we discuss four modes for computer-assisted data collection: CAPI (Computer-Assisted (Computer-Assisted Web Interviewing). For moreinformation on computer-assisted data collection in general, we refer to Couperet al. (1998). When CAPI is used to collect the data, an interviewer visits the respondent and enters the answers directly into a laptop. When CATI is used to collect thedata, the interview is carried out during a telephone call. When CASI or CAWIis used to collect the data, the respondent lls in an electronic questionnairehimself. The difference between these two modes is that for CAWI an electronicquestionnaire on the Internet has to be lled in, whereas for CASI an off-lineelectronic questionnaire is used. When an invalid response is given to a questionor an inconsistency between two or more answers is noted during any of thesedata collection modes, this can be immediately reported by the computer that isused for data entry. The error can then be resolved by asking the respondent therelevant question(s) again. For CASI and CAWI, generally not all edits that couldbe specied are actually implemented, since the respondent may get annoyedand might refuse to complete the questionnaire when the edits keep on reportingthat his/her answers are inconsistent. Computer-assisted data collection removes the need for data entry by typists, since the data arrive at the statistical ofce already in digital form. This eliminatesone source of potential errors. In many cases, data collected by means of CAPI,CATI, CASI or CAWI also contain fewer errors than data collected by means ofpaper questionnaires because random errors that affect paper questionnaires aredetected and avoided at collection. For face-to-face interviewing CAPI has in factbecome the standard. CAPI, CATI, CASI, and CAWI may hence seem to be idealways to collect data, but\u2014unfortunately\u2014they too have their disadvantages. A rst disadvantage of CATI and CAPI is that CATI and, especially, CAPI are very expensive. A second disadvantage of CATI and CAPI is that a prerequisite for these two data collection modes is that the respondent is able to answer thequestions during the interview. For a survey on persons and households, this isoften the case. The respondent often knows (good proxies of) the answers to the questions, or is able to retrieve the answers quickly. For a survey on enterprises the situation is quite different. Often it is impossible to retrieve the correctanswers quickly, and often the answers are not even known by one person orone department of an enterprise. Finally, even in the exceptional case that oneperson knew all answers to the questions, the NSI would generally not know theidentity of this person. For the above-mentioned reasons, many NSIs frequentlyuse CAPI and CATI to collect data on persons and households but only rarelyfor data on enterprises. Pilot studies and actual applications have revealed that CASI and CAWI are indeed viable data collection modes, but also that several problems arise when1.4 Basic Methods for Statistical Data Editing and Imputation 15 these modes are used. Besides IT problems, such as that the software\u2014and the Internet connection\u2014should be fast and reliable and the security of thetransmitted data should be guaranteed, there are a number of practical and statistical problems. We have already mentioned the practical problem that if the edits keep on reporting that the answers are inconsistent, the respondentmay refuse to ll in the rest of the questionnaire. An example of a statisticalproblem is that the group of people responding to a web survey may be selective,since Internet usage is not uniformly distributed over the population [see, e.g.,Bethlehem (2007)]. Another important problem for CAWI and CASI is that data collected by either of these data collection modes may appear to be of higher statistical quality than data collected by means of paper questionnaires, but in fact are not.When data are collected by means of CASI and CAWI, one can enforce thatthe respondents supply data that satisfy built-in edits, or one can avoid balanceedits by automatically calculating total amounts from the reported components. Because less edits are failed by the collected data, these data may appear to be of higher statistical quality. This need not be the case, however. Each edit thatis built into the electronic questionnaire will be automatically satised by thecollected data, and hence cannot be used to check for errors later on. Therefore,the collected data may appear to contain only few errors, but this might bedue to a lack of relevant edits. There are indications that respondents can beless accurate when lling in an electronic questionnaire, especially if totals arecomputed automatically [see B\u00f8rke (2008) and Hoogland and Smit (2008)]. NSIs seem to be moving toward the use of mixed-mode data collection, where data are collected by a mix of several data collection modes. This obviouslyhas consequences for statistical data editing. Some of the potential consequenceshave been examined by B\u00f8rke (2008), Hoogland and Smit (2008), and Van der Loo (2008). 1.4.2 MODERN EDITING METHODS Below we briefly mention editing methods that are used in modern practice. The editing techniques are examined in detail in other chapters of this book. Interactive Editing. Subject-matter specialists have extensive knowledge on their area of expertise. This knowledge should be used as well as possible.This aim can be achieved by providing subject-matter specialists with efcientand effective interactive data editing tools. Most interactive data editing toolsapplied at NSIs allow one to check the specied edits during or after data entry,and\u2014if necessary\u2014to correct erroneous data immediately. This is referred toas interactive or computer-assisted editing. To correct erroneous data, severalapproaches can be followed: The respondent can be recontacted, the respondent's data can be compared to his data from previous years, the respondent's data can be compared to data from similar respondents, and subject-matter knowledge ofthe human editor can be used. Interactive e diting is nowadays a standard way to edit data. It can be used to edit both categorical and numerical data. The number16 CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Statistical Data Editing and Imputation of variables, edits, and records may, in principle, be high. Generally, the quality of data editing in a computer-assisted manner is considered high. Interactiveediting is examined in more detail in Section 6.5. Selective Editing. Selective editing is an umbrella term for several methods to identify the influential errors (i.e., the errors that have a substantial impacton the publication gures) and outliers (i.e., values that do not t a model ofthe data well). Selective editing techniques aim to apply interactive editing toa well-chosen subset of the records, such that the limited time and resourcesavailable for interactive editing are allocated to those records where it has the mosteffect on the quality of the nal estimates of publication gures. Selective editingtechniques try to achieve this aim by splitting the data into two streams: thecritical stream and the noncritical stream. The critical stream consists of recordsthat are the most likely ones to contain influential errors; the noncritical streamconsists of records that are unlikely to contain influential errors. The recordsin the critical stream, the critical records, are edited in a traditional interactivemanner. The records in the noncritical stream, the noncritical records, are notedited in a computer-assisted manner. They may later be edited automatically.Selective editing is examined in Chapter 6. Macro-editing. We distinguish between two forms of macro-editing. The rst form is sometimes called the aggregation method [see, e.g., Granquist (1990)]. Itformalizes and systematizes what every statistical agency does before publication:verifying whether gures to be published seem plausible. This is accomplished bycomparing quantities in publication tables with the same quantities in previouspublications. Only if an unusual value is observed, a micro-editing procedureis applied to the individual records and elds contributing to the suspiciousquantity. A second form of macro-editing is the distribution method. Theavailable data are used to characterize the distribution of the variables. Then,all individual values are compared with the distribution. Typically, measuresof location and spread are computed. Records containing values that couldbe considered uncommon (given the distribution) are candidates for furtherinspection and possibly for editing. Macro-editing, in particular the aggregationmethod, has always been applied at statistical ofces. Macro-editing is againexamined further in Chapter 6. Automatic Editing. When automatic editing is applied, records are edited by a computer without human intervention. In this sense, automatic editing is theopposite of the traditional approach to the editing problem, where each record is edited manually. Automatic editing has already been used in the 1960s and 1970s [see, e.g., Nordbotten (1963)]. Nevertheless, it has never become verypopular. For this we point out two reasons. First, in former days, computerswere too slow to edit data automatically. Second, development of a system forautomatic editing was often considered too complicated and too costly by manystatistical ofces. In the last two decades, however, a lot of progress has been madewith respect to automatic editing: Computers have become faster and algorithms1.5 An Edit and Imputation Strategy 17 have been simplied and have also become more efcient. For these reasons we pay more attention to automatic editing than to the other editing techniques inthis book. Automatic editing of systematic errors is examined in Chapter 2, and automatic editing of random errors in Chapters 3 to 5. 1.4.3 IMPUTATION METHODS To estimate a missing value, or a value that was identied as being erroneousduring statistical data editing, two main approaches can be used. The rst approach is manual imputation or correction, where the corresponding respon- dent is recontacted or subject-matter knowledge is used to obtain an estimate for the missing or erroneous value. The second approach is automated imputation,which is based on statistical estimation techniques, such as regression models. In this book, we only treat the latter approach. In imputation, predictions from parametric or nonparametric models are derived for values that are missing or flagged as erroneous. An imputation modelpredicts a missing value using a function of auxiliary variables, the predictors. The auxiliary variables may be obtained from the current survey or from othersources such as historical information (the value of the missing variable in a previous period) or, increasingly important, administrative data. The most common types of imputation models are variants of regression models withparameters estimated from the observed correct data. However, especially for categorical variables, donor methods are also frequently used. Donor methods replace missing values in a record with the corresponding values from a nearby complete and valid record. Often a donor record is chosen such that it resembles as much as possible the record with missing values. Imputation methods aretreated in Chapters 7 to 9 of this book. 1.5 An Edit and Imputation Strategy Data editing is usually performed as a sequence of different detection and/orcorrection process steps. In this section we give a global description of an editing strategy. This description is general enough to include the situation for many data sets as special cases, and most editing strategies applied in practice will at leastinclude a number of the elements and principles described here. The process steps can be characterized from different points of view\u2014for instance, by the type of errors they try to detect or resolve or by the methods that are used for detectionor correction. Another important distinction is between automatic methods that can be executed without human intervention and interactive editing that is performed by editors. The global editing strategy as depicted in Figure 1.1 consists of the following ve steps that are claried below. 1.Treatment of Systematic Errors . Identify and eliminate errors that are evident and easy to treat with sufcient reliability.18 CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Statistical Data Editing and Imputation 1. Correction of systematic errors 3b.

Select records for interactive treatment that contain influ- ential errors that cannot be treated automatically with sufcient reliability. 3.Automatic Editing . Apply all relevant automatic error detection and correc- tion procedures to the (many) records that are not selected for interactive editing in step 2. 4.Interactive Editing . Apply interactive editing to the minority of the records with influential errors. 5.Macro-selection . Select records with influential errors by using methods based on outlier detection techniques and other procedures that make use ofall or a large fraction of the response.1.5 An Edit and Imputation Strategy 19 We distinguish two kinds of process steps: those that localize or treat errors and those that direct the records through the different stages of the process. The processes in step 2 and 5 are of the latter kind; they are ''selectors'' that do notactually treat errors, but select records for specic kinds of further processing. Step 1. Correction of Systematic Errors . Detection and correction of system- atic errors is an important rst step in an editing process. It can be done automatically and reliably at virtually no costs and hence will improve boththe efciency and the quality of the editing process. It is in fact a very efcientand probably often underused correction approach. Systematic and otherevident errors and algorithms that can automatically resolve these errors aredescribed in Chapter 2 of this book. Step 2. Micro-selection . Errors that cannot be resolved in the previous step will be taken care of either manually (by subject-matter specialists) or automatically (by specialized edit and imput ation algorithms). In this step, the data are split into a critical stream and a noncritical stream, usingselective editing techniques as mentioned in Section 1.4.2. The extent towhich a record potentially contains influential errors can be measured by ascore function [cf. Latouche and Berthelot (1992), Lawrence and McKenzie(2000), and Farwell and Rain (2000)]. This function is constructed suchthat records with high scores likely contain errors that have substantial effectson estimates of target parameters. For this selection step, a threshold valuefor the score has been set and all records with scores above this threshold aredirected to manual reviewers whereas records with scores below the thresholdare treated automatically. More de tails can be found in Chapter 6. Apart from the score function, which looks at influential errors, another important selection criterion is imputability. For some variables, very accu-rate imputation models can be developed. If such a variable fails an edit,the erroneous value can safely be replaced by an imputed value, even if itis an influential value. Note that the correction of systematic errors in theprevious step can also be an example of automatic treatment of influentialerrors, if the systematic error is an influential one. Step 3a. Localization of erroneous values (random errors) . The next three steps are automatic detection and correction procedures. In principle, they are designed to solve hard edit failures, including missing values, but they canbe applied to soft edits if the soft edit is treated as a hard one. These three steps together represent the vast majority of all edit and imputation methodology. The other chapters of this book are devoted to this methodology forautomatic detection and correction of erroneous and missing values. The rst step in the automatic treatment of errors is the localization of errors. Since systematic errors have already been removed, the remainingerrors at this stage are random errors. Once the (hard) edits are dened andimplemented, it is straightforward to check whether the values in a record areinconsistent in the sense that some of these edits are violated. It is, however,not so obvious how to decide which variables in an inconsistent record arein error. The designation of erroneous values in an inconsistent record is20 CHAPTER 1 Introduction to Statistical Data Editing and Imputation called the error localization problem, which is treated in Chapters 3 to 5 of this book. Step 3b. Imputation . In this step, missing data are imputed in an automatic manner. The imputation method that is best suited for a particular situation will depend on the characteristics of the data set and the research goals. In Chapters 7 to 9 we examine imputation methods in detail. Step 3c. Consistency Adjustment of Imputed Values . In most cases, the edits are not taken into account by the imputation methods; some exceptions are examined in Chapter 9. As a consequence, the imputed records are in general inconsistent with the edits. This problem can be solved by the introduction of an adjustment step in which adjustments are made to the imputed values such that the record satises all edits and the adjustments are as small as possible. This problem can be formulated as a linear or a quadratic programming problem and is treated in Chapter 10. Step 4. Interactive Editing . Substantial mistakes by somewhat larger enter- prises that have an appreciable influence on publication aggregates and for which no accurate imputation model exists are not considered suitable for the generic procedures of automatic editing. These records are treated by subject-matter specialists in a process step called interactive editing; see Section 1.4.2 above and Chapter 6. Step 5. Macro-selection . The steps considered so far all use micro-editing methods\u2014that is, methods that use the data of a single record and related auxiliary information to check and correct it. Micro-editing processes can be conducted from the start of the data collection phase, as soon as records become available. In contrast, macro-selection techniques use information from other records and can only be applied if a substantial part of the data is collected or has been imputed. Macro-selection techniques are also selective editing techniques in the sense that they aim to direct the attention only to possibly influential erroneous values. Macro-editing is treated in Chapter 6 of this book. The process flow suggested in Figure 1.1 is just one possibility. Depending on the type of survey and the available resources and auxiliary information, the process flow can be different. Not all steps are always carried out, the order of steps may be different, and the particular methods used in each step can differ between types of surveys. For social surveys, for instance, selective editing is not very important because the contributions of individuals to a publication total are not so much different, unlike the contributions of small and large enterprises inbusiness surveys. Consequently, there is less need for manual editing of influential records, and step 4 need not be performed. Often, in social surveys, due to a lack of hard edits, the main type of detectable error is the missing value, and process steps 3a and 3c are not performed either. For administrative data the collection of all records, or a large part of it, is often available at once. This is different from the situation for surveys where the data are collected over a period of time. For administrative data it is therefore possible to form preliminary estimates immediately and to start with macro-editing as a tool for selective editing, andReferences 21 a process could start with step 1, followed by step 5 and possibly by step 4 and/or step 3. Although automatic procedures are frequently used for relatively unim- portant errors, choosing the most suitable error detection and/or imputationmethods is still important. If nonappropriate methods are used, especially for large amounts of random errors and/or missing values, additional bias may be introduced. Furthermore, as the quality of the automatic error localization and imputation methods and models gets better, more records can be entrusted to the automatic treatment in step 3 and less records have to be selected for thetime-consuming and costly interactive editing step.

James Thurber (1945), The Scotty Who Knew Too Much 'Inequality' is in itself an awkward word, as well as one used in connectionwith a number of awkward social and economic problems. The difculty isthat the word can trigger quite a number of different ideas in the mind of areader or listener, depending on his training and prejudice. 'Inequality' obviously suggests a departure from some idea of equality. This may be nothing more than an unemotive mathematical statement, in whichcase 'equality' just represents the fact that two or more given quantitiesare the same size, and 'inequality' merely relates to differences in thesequantities. On the other hand, the term 'equality' evidently has compellingsocial overtones as a standard which it is presumably feasible for societyto attain. The meaning to be attached to this is not self-explanatory. Someyears ago Professors Rein and Miller revealingly interpreted this standard ofequality in nine separate ways rOne-hundred-percentism: in other words, complete horizontal equity\u2014'equal treatment of equals'. rThe social minimum: here one aims to ensure that no one falls belowsome minimum standard of well-being. rEqualization of lifetime income proles : this focuses on inequality of future income prospects, rather than on the people's current position. rMobility : that is, a desire to narrow the differentials and to reduce the barriers between occupational groups. rEconomic inclusion : the objective is to reduce or eliminate the feeling of exclusion from society caused by differences in incomes or some otherendowment. 1Measuring Inequality rIncome shares: society aims to increase the share of national income (orsome other 'cake') enjoyed by a relatively disadvantaged group\u2014such asthe lowest tenth of income recipients. rLowering the ceiling : attention is directed towards limiting the share of the cake enjoyed by a relatively advantaged section of the population. rAvoidance of income and wealth crystallization : this just means eliminating the disproportionate advantages (or disadvantages) in education, polit-ical power, social acceptability and so on that may be entailed by anadvantage (or disadvantage) in the income or wealth scale. rInternational yardsticks: a nation takes as its goal that it should be nomore unequal than another 'comparable' nation. Their list is probably not exhaustive and it may include items which you do not feel properly belong on the agenda of inequality measurement; but itserves to illustrate the diversity of views about the nature of the subject\u2014letalone its political, moral or economic signicance\u2014which may be presentin a reasoned discussion of equality and inequality. Clearly, each of thesecriteria of 'equality' would influence in its own particular way the mannerin which we might dene and measure inequality. Each of these potentiallyraises particular issues of social justice that should concern an interestedobserver. And if I were to try to explore just these nine suggestions with thefullness that they deserve, I should easily make this book much longer thanI wish. In order to avoid this mishap let us drastically reduce the problem by trying to set out what the essential ingredients of a Principle of InequalityMeasurement should be. We shall nd that these basic elements underlie astudy of equality and inequality along almost any of the nine lines suggestedin the brief list given above. The ingredients are easily stated. For each ingredient it is possible to use materials of high quality\u2014with conceptual and empirical nuances nelygraded. However, in order to make rapid progress, I have introduced somecheap substitutes which I have indicated in each case in the followinglist: rSpecication of an individual social unit such as a single person, thenuclear family or the extended family. I shall refer casually to 'persons'. rDescription of a particular attribute (or attributes) such as income,wealth, land-ownership or voting strength. I shall use the term 'income'as a loose coverall expression. rA method of representation or aggregation of the allocation of 'income'among the 'persons' in a given population. 2First Principles The list is simple and brief, but it will take virtually the whole book to deal with these fundamental ingredients, even in rudimentary terms. 1.1 A preview of the book The nal item on the list of ingredients will command much of our atten-tion. As a quick glance ahead will reveal we shall spend quite some timelooking at intuitive and formal methods of aggregation in Chapters 2 and 3.In Chapter 2 we encounter several standard measurement tools that are oftenused and sometimes abused. This will be a chapter of 'ready-mades' wherewe take as given the standard equipment in the literature without particularregard to its origin or the principles on which it is based. By contrast theeconomic analysis of Chapter 3 introduces specic distributional principleson which to base comparisons of inequality. This step, incorporating explicitcriteria of social justice, is done in three main ways: social welfare analysis,the concept of distance between income distributions, and an introductionto the axiomatic approach to inequality measurement. On the basis of theseprinciples we can appraise the tailor-made devices of Chapter 3 as well asthe off-the-peg items from Chapter 2. Impatient readers who want a quicksummary of most of the things one might want to know about the propertiesof inequality measures could try turning to page 74 for an instant answer. Chapter 4 approaches the problem of representing and aggregating infor- mation about the income distribution from a quite different direction. Itintroduces the idea of modelling the income distribution rather than justtaking the raw bits and pieces of information and applying inequality mea-sures or other presentational devices to them. In particular we deal withtwo very useful functional forms of income distribution that are frequentlyencountered in the literature. In my view the ground covered by Chapter 5 is essential for an adequate understanding of the subject matter of this book. The practical issues whichare discussed there put meaning into the theoretical constructs with whichyou will have become acquainted in Chapters 2 to 4. This is where you willnd discussion of the practical importance of the choice of income deni-tion (ingredient 1) and of income receiver (ingredient 2); of the problemsof using equivalence scales to make comparisons between heterogeneousincome units and of the problems of zero values when using certain deni-tions of income. In Chapter 5 also we shall look at how to deal with patchydata, and how to assess the importance of inequality changes empirically. The back end of the book contains two further items that you may nd helpful. Appendix A has been used mainly to tidy away some of the morecumbersome formulas which would otherwise have cluttered the text; you 3Measuring Inequality may want to dip into it to check up on the precise mathematical denitionsand results that are described verbally or graphically in the main text.Appendix B (Notes on Sources and Literature) has been used mainly to coverliterature references which would otherwise have also cluttered the text; ifyou want to follow up the principal articles on a specic topic, or to trackdown the reference containing detailed proof of some of the key results, thisis where you should turn rst; it also gives you the background to the dataexamples found throughout the book. Finally, a word or two about this chapter. The remainder of the chapter deals with some of the issues of principle concerning all three ingredients onthe list; it provides some forward pointers to other parts of the book wheretheoretical niceties or empirical implementation is dealt with more fully; italso touches on some of the deeper philosophical issues that underpin aninterest in the subject of measuring inequality. It is to theoretical questionsabout the second of the three ingredients of inequality measurement thatwe shall turn rst. 1.2 Inequality of what? Let us consider some of the problems of the denition of a personal attribute,such as income, that is suitable for inequality measurement. This attributecan be interpreted in a wide sense if an overall indicator of social inequalityis required, or in a narrow sense if one is concerned only with inequality inthe distribution of some specic attribute or talent. Let us deal rst with thespecial questions raised by the former interpretation. If you want to take inequality in a global sense, then it is evident that you will need a comprehensive concept of 'income'\u2014an index that will serve torepresent generally a person's well-being in society. There are a number ofpersonal economic characteristics which spring to mind as candidates forsuch an index\u2014for example, wealth, lifetime income, weekly or monthlyincome. Will any of these do as an all-purpose attribute? While we might not go as far as Anatole France in describing wealth as a 'sacred thing', it has an obvious attraction for us (as students of inequality).For wealth represents a person's total immediate command over resources.Hence, for each man or woman we have an aggregate which includes themoney in the bank, the value of holdings of stocks and bonds, the valueof the house and the car, his ox, his ass, and everything that he has. Thereare two difculties with this. First, how are these disparate possessions to bevalued and aggregated in money terms? It is not clear that prices ruling in themarket (where such markets exist) appropriately reflect the relative economicpower inherent in these various assets. Second, there are other, less tangible 4First Principles assets which ought perhaps to be included in this notional command overresources, but which a conventional valuation procedure would omit. One major example of this is a person's occupational pension rights: having a job that entitles me to a pension upon my eventual retirementis certainly valuable, but how valuable? Such rights may not be susceptibleto being cashed in like other assets so that their true worth is tricky to assess. A second important example of such an asset is the presumed prerogative of higher future incomes accruing to those possessing greater educationor training. Surely the value of these income rights should be included inthe calculation of a person's wealth just as is the value of other income-yielding assets such as stocks or bonds? To do this we need an aggregate ofearnings over the entire life span. Such an aggregate\u2014'lifetime income'\u2014in conjunction with other forms of wealth appears to yield the index ofpersonal well-being that we seek, in that it includes in a comprehensivefashion the entire set of economic opportunities enjoyed by a person.The drawbacks, however, are manifest. Since lifetime summation of actualincome receipts can only be performed once the income recipient is deceased(which limits its operational usefulness), such a summation must be carriedout on anticipated future incomes. Following this course we are led into thedifculty of forecasting these income prospects and of placing on them avaluation that appropriately allows for their uncertainty. Although I do notwish to assert that the complex theoretical problems associated with suchlifetime aggregates are insuperable, it is expedient to turn, with an eye onChapter 5 and practical matters, to income itself. Income\u2014dened as the increase in a person's command over resources during a given time period\u2014may seem restricted in comparison with theall-embracing nature of wealth or lifetime income. It has the obvious disad-vantages that it relates only to an arbitrary time unit (such as one year) andthus that it excludes the effect of past accumulations except in so far as theseare deployed in income-yielding assets. However, there are two principaloffsetting merits: rif income includes unearned income, capital gains, and 'income in kind'as well as earnings, then it can be claimed as a fairly comprehensiveindex of a person's well-being at a given moment; rinformation on personal income is generally more widely available andmore readily interpretable than for wealth or lifetime income. Furthermore, note that none of the three concepts that have been dis- cussed completely covers the command over resources for all goods and ser-vices in society. Measures of personal wealth or income exclude 'social wage'elements such as the benets received from communally enjoyed items like 5Measuring Inequality municipal parks, public libraries, the police, and ballistic missile systems, theinterpersonal distribution of which services may only be conjectured. In view of the difculty inherent in nding a global index of 'well- offness', we may prefer to consider the narrow denition of the thing called'income'. Depending on the problem in hand, it can make sense to lookat inequality in the endowment of some other personal attribute, such asconsumption of a particular good, life expectancy, land ownership, etc.This may be applied also to publicly owned assets or publicly consumedcommodities if we direct attention not to interpersonal distribution but to intercommunity distribution\u2014for example, the inequality in the distribution ofper capita energy consumption in different countries. The problems con- cerning 'income' that I now discuss apply with equal force to the widerinterpretation considered in the earlier paragraphs. It is evident from the foregoing that two key characteristics of the 'income' index are that it be measurable and that it be comparable among different persons. That these two characteristics are mutually independent can bedemonstrated by two contrived examples. First, to show that an index mightbe measurable but not comparable, take the case where well-being is mea-sured by consumption per head within families, the family rather than theindividual being taken as the basic social unit. Suppose that consumption byeach family in the population is known but that the number of persons isnot. Then for each family, welfare is measurable up to an arbitrary change inscale, in this sense: for family A doubling its income makes it twice as well-off, trebling it makes it three times as well-off; the same holds for familyB; but A's welfare scale and B's welfare scale cannot be compared unless weknow the numbers in each family. Second, to show that an index may beinterpersonally comparable, but not measurable in the conventional sense,take the case where 'access to public services' is used as an indicator ofwelfare. Consider two public services, gas and electricity supply\u2014householdsmay be connected to one or to both or to neither of them\u2014and the followingscale (in descending order of amenity) is generally recognized: raccess to both gas and to electricity only; raccess to gas only; raccess to neither. We can compare households' amenities\u2014A and B are as well-off as each other if they are both connected only to electricity\u2014but it makes no senseto say that A is twice as well-off if it is connected to gas as well as electricity. It is possible to make some progress in the study of inequality with- out measurability of the welfare index, and sometimes even without full 6First Principles comparability. For most of the time, however, I shall make both theseassumptions, which may be unwarranted. For this implies that when I writethe word 'income', I assume that it is so dened that adjustment has alreadybeen made for non-comparability on account of differing needs, and thatfundamental differences in tastes (with regard to relative valuation of leisureand monetary income, for example) may be ruled out of consideration. Weshall reconsider the problems of non-comparability in Chapter 5. The nal point in connection with the 'income' index that I shall mention can be described as the 'constant amount of cake'. We shall usually talk ofinequality freely as though there is some xed total of goodies to be sharedamong the population. This is denitionally true for certain quantities, suchas the distribution of acres of land (except perhaps in the Netherlands).However, this is evidently questionable when talking about income as con-ventionally dened in economics. If an arbitrary change is envisaged inthe distribution of income among persons, we may reasonably expect thatthe size of the cake to be divided\u2014national income\u2014might change as aresult. Or, if we try to compare inequality in a particular country's incomedistribution at two points in time, it is quite likely that total income willhave changed during the interim. Moreover, if the size of the cake changes,either autonomously or as a result of some redistributive action, this changein itself may modify our view of the amount of inequality that there is insociety. Having raised this important issue of the relationship between interper- sonal distribution and the production of economic goods, I shall temporarilyevade it by assuming that a given whole is to be shared as a number ofequal or unequal parts. For some descriptions of inequality this assumptionis irrelevant. However, since the size of the cake as well as its distribution isvery important in social welfare theory, we shall consider the relationshipbetween inequality and total income in Chapter 3 (particularly page 48),and examine the practical implications of a growing\u2014or dwindling\u2014cake inChapter 5 (see page 143.) 1.3 Inequality measurement, justice, and poverty So what is meant by an inequality measure? In order to introduce this devicewhich serves as the third 'ingredient' mentioned previously, let us try asimple denition which roughly summarizes the common usage of the term: ra scalar numerical representation of the interpersonal differences inincome within a given population. Now let us take this bland statement apart. 7Measuring Inequality Scalar Inequality The use of the word 'scalar' implies that all the different features of inequalityare compressed into a single number\u2014or a single point on a scale. Appealingarguments can be produced against the contraction of information involvedin this aggregation procedure. Should we don this one-dimensional strait-jacket when surely our brains are well-developed enough to cope with morethan one number at a time? There are three points in reply here. First, if we want a multi-number representation of inequality, we can easily arrange this by using a variety of indices each capturing a differentcharacteristic of the social state, and each possessing attractive properties as ayardstick of inequality in its own right. We shall see some practical examples(in Chapters 3 and 5) where we do exactly that. Second, however, we often want to answer a question like 'has inequality increased or decreased?' with a straight 'yes' or 'no'. But if we make theconcept of inequality multi-dimensional we greatly increase the possibilityof coming up with ambiguous answers. For example, suppose we representinequality by two numbers, each describing a different aspect of inequalityof the same 'income' attribute. We may depict this as a point such as B inFig. 1.1, which reveals that there is an amount I 1of type-1 inequality, and I2of type-2 inequality. Obviously all points like C represent states of society that are more unequal than B, and points such as A represent less unequalstates. But it is much harder to compare B and D or to compare B and E. Ifwe attempt to resolve this difculty, we will nd that we are effectively usinga single-number representation of inequality after all. Third, multi-number representations of income distributions may well have their place alongside a standard scalar inequality measure. As we shall type-2 inequalityC E A D type-1 1 . Two types of inequality 8First Principles more inequality 1980 1990 1992 1985 less inequality FIG.1 . 2 . An inequality ranking see in later chapters, even if a single agreed number scale ( I1orI2) is unavail- able, or even if a collection of such scales ( I1and I2) cannot be found, we might be able to agree on an inequality ranking. This is a situation where\u2014although you may not be able to order or to sort the income distributionsuniquely (most equal at the bottom, most unequal at the top)\u2014you never-theless nd that you can arrange them in a pattern that enables you to geta fairly useful picture of what is going on. To get the idea, have a look atFig. 1.2. We might nd that over a period of time the complex changes inthe relevant income distribution can be represented schematically as in theleague table illustrated there: you can say that inequality went down from1980 to 1985, and went up from 1985 to either 1990 or 1992; but you cannotsay whether inequality went up or down in the early nineties. Although thismethod of looking at inequality is not decisive in terms of every possiblecomparison of distributions, it could still provide valuable information. Numerical Representation What interpretation should be placed on the phrase 'numerical representa-tion' in the denition of an inequality measure? The answer to this dependson whether we are interested in just the ordering properties of an inequalitymeasure or in the actual size of the index and of changes in the index. To see this, look at the following example. Imagine four different social states A ,B,C,D, and four rival inequality measures I 1,I2,I3,I4. The rst column in Table 1.1 gives the values of the rst measure, I1, realized in each of the four situations. Are any of the other candidates equivalent to I1? Notice that I3has a strong claim in this regard. Not only does it rank A,B,C,D in the same order, it also shows that the percentage change in inequality in going from one state to another is the same as if we use the I1scale. If this is true for all social states, we will call I1and I3cardinally 9Measuring Inequality Table 1.1. Four inequality scales I1 I2 I3 I4 A .10 .13 .24 .12 B .25 .26 .60 .16 C .30 .34 .72 .20 D .40 .10 .96 .22 equivalent . More formally, I1and I3are cardinally equivalent if one scale can be obtained from the other, multiplying by a positive constant andadding or subtracting another constant. In the above case, we multiply I 1 by 2.4 and add on zero to get I3. Now consider I4: it ranks the four states A to D in the same order as I1, but it does not give the same percentage differences (compare the gaps between A and B and between B and C). So I1and I4are certainly not cardinally equivalent. However, if it is true that I1and I4always rank any set of social states in the same order, we will say that the two scales are ordinally equivalent .1Obviously cardinal equivalence entails ordinal equivalence, but not vice versa. Finally we note that I2is not ordinally equivalent to the others, although for all we know it may be aperfectly sensible inequality measure. Now let A be the year 1970, let B be 1960, and D be 1950. Given the question, 'Was inequality less in 1970 than it was in 1960?', I 1produces the same answer as any other ordinally equivalent measure (such as I3or I4): 'numerical representation' simply means a ranking. But, given the question,'Did inequality fall more in the 1960s than it did in the 1950s?', I 1only yields the same answer as other cardinally equivalent measures ( I3alone): here inequality needs to have the same kind of 'numerical representation' astemperature on a thermometer. Income Differences Should any and every 'income difference' be reflected in a measure ofinequality? The commonsense answer is 'No', for two basic reasons: needand merit. The rst reason is the more obvious: large families and the sickneed more resources than the single, healthy person to support a particulareconomic standard. Hence in a 'just' allocation, we would expect thosewith such greater needs to have a higher income than other people; suchincome differences would thus be based on a principle of justice, and should 1Am a t h e m a t i c a ln o t e : I1and I4are ordinally equivalent if one may be written as a monoton- ically increasing function of the other, say I1=f(I4), where dI1/dI 4>0. An example of such a function is log( I).I1and I3are cardinally equivalent if ftakes the following special form: h e r eb is a positive number. 10First Principles not be treated as inequalities. To cope with this difculty one may adjustthe income concept such that allowance is made for diversity of need, asmentioned in the last section; this is something which needs to be donewith some care\u2014as we will nd in Chapter 5 (see the discussion on page110). The case for ignoring differences on account of merit depends on the inter- pretation attached to 'equality'. One obviously rough-and-ready descriptionof a just allocation requires equal incomes for all irrespective of personaldifferences other than need. However, one may argue strongly that in a justallocation higher incomes should be received by doctors, heroes, inventors,Stakhanovites, and other deserving persons. Unfortunately, in practice it ismore difcult to make adjustments similar to those suggested in the case ofneed and, more generally, even distinguishing between income differencesthat do represent genuine inequalities and those that do not poses a seriousproblem. Given Population The last point about the denition of an inequality measure concerns thephrase 'given population' and needs to be claried in two ways. First, whenexamining the population over say a number of years, what shall we doabout the effect on measured inequality of persons who either enter orleave the population, or whose status changes in some other relevant way?The usual assumption is that as long as the overall structure of incomedifferences stays the same (regardless of whether different personnel are nowreceiving those incomes), measured inequality remains unaltered. Hencethe phenomenon of social mobility within or in-and-out of the populationeludes the conventional method of measuring inequality, although somemight argue that it is connected with inequality of opportunity. 2Secondly, one is not exclusively concerned with inequality in the population as awhole. It is useful to be able to decompose this 'laterally' into inequalitywithin constituent groups, differentiated regionally or demographically per-haps, and inequality between these constituent groups. Indeed, once oneacknowledges basic heterogeneities within the population, such as age orsex, awkward problems of aggregation may arise, although we shall ignorethem. It may also be useful to decompose inequality 'vertically' so that onelooks at inequality within a subgroup of the rich or of the poor, for example.Hence the specication of the given population is by no means a trivialprerequisite to the application of inequality measurement. 2Check Question 6 at the end of the chapter to see if you concur with this view. 11Measuring Inequality Although the denition has made it clear that an inequality measure calls for a numerical scale, I have not suggested how this scale should becalibrated. Specic proposals for this will occupy Chapters 2 and 3, but acouple of basic points may be made here. You may have noticed just now that the notion of justice was slipped in while income differences were being considered. In most applications ofinequality analysis social justice really ought to be centre stage. That morejust societies should register lower numbers on the inequality scale evidentlyaccords with an intuitive appreciation of the term 'inequality'. But, on whatbasis should principles of distributional justice and concern for inequalitybe based? Economic philosophers have offered a variety of answers. Thisconcern could be no more than the concern about the everyday risks of life:just as individuals are upset by the nancial consequences of having their carstolen or missing their plane, so too they would care about the hypotheticalrisk of drawing a losing ticket in a lottery of life chances; this lottery couldbe represented by the income distribution in the UK, the USA, or wherever;nice utilitarian calculations on the balance of small-scale gains and lossesbecome utilitarian calculations about life chances; aversion to risk translatesinto aversion to inequality. Or the concern could be based upon the altruisticfeelings of each human towards his fellows that motivates charitable action.Or again it could be that there is a social imperative toward concern for theleast advantaged\u2014and perhaps concern about the inordinately rich\u2014thattranscends the personal twinges of altruism and envy. It could be simpleconcern about the possibility of social unrest. It is possible to construct acoherent justice-based theory of inequality measurement on each of thesenotions, although that takes us beyond the remit of this book. However, if we can clearly specify what a just distribution is, such a state provides the zero from which we start our inequality measure. But even awell-dened principle of distributive justice is not sufcient to enable oneto mark off an inequality scale unambiguously when considering diverseunequal social states. Each of the apparently contradictory scales I 1and I2considered in Fig. 1.1 and Table 1.1 might be solidly founded on the same principle of justice, unless such a principle were extremely narrowlydened. The other general point is that we might suppose there is a close link between an indicator of the extent of poverty and the calibration of a mea-sure of economic inequality. This is not necessarily so, because two ratherdifferent problems are generally involved. In the case of the measurementof poverty, one is concerned primarily with that segment of the populationfalling below some specied 'poverty line'; to obtain the poverty measureone may perform a simple head count of this segment, or calculate the gap 12First Principles between the average income of the poor and the average income of thegeneral population, or carry out some other computation on poor people'sincomes in relation to each other and to the rest of the population. Now, inthe case of inequality one generally wishes to capture the effects of incomedifferences over a much wider range. Hence it is perfectly possible for themeasured extent of poverty to be declining over time, while at the sametime and in the same society measured inequality increases due to changesin income differences within the non-poor segment of the population, orbecause of migrations between the two groups. (If you are in doubt aboutthis you might like to have a look at Question 5 on page 14.) Poverty willmake a few guest appearances in the course of this book, but on the wholeour discussion of inequality has to take a slightly different track from themeasurement of poverty. 1.4 Inequality and the social structure Finally we return to the subject of the rst ingredient, namely the basic socialunits used in studying inequality\u2014or the elementary particles of which weimagine society to be constituted. The denition of the social unit, whetherit be a single person, a nuclear family, or an extended family depends intrin-sically upon the social context, and upon the interpretation of inequalitythat we impose. Although it may seem natural to adopt an individualisticapproach, some other 'collective' unit may be more appropriate. When economic inequality is our particular concern, the theory of the development of the distribution of income or wealth may itself influencethe choice of the basic social unit. To illustrate this, consider the classicalview of an economic system, the population being subdivided into distinctclasses of workers, capitalists, and landowners. Each class is characterized bya particular function in the economic order and by an associated type ofincome\u2014wages, prots, and rents. If, further, each is regarded as internallyfairly homogeneous, then it makes sense to pursue the analysis of inequalityin class terms rather than in terms of individual units. However, so simple a model is unsuited to describing inequality in a signicantly heterogeneous society, despite the potential usefulness of classanalysis for other social problems. A supercial survey of the world aroundus reveals rich and poor workers, failed and successful capitalists, and severalpeople whose r\u00f4les and incomes do not t into neat slots. Hence the focusof attention in this book is principally upon individuals rather than types,whether the analysis is interpreted in terms of economic inequality or someother sense. 13Measuring Inequality Thus reduced to its essentials it might appear that we are dealing with a purely formal problem, which sounds rather dull. This is not so. Althoughthe subject matter of this book is largely technique, the techniques involvedare essential for coping with the analysis of many social and economicproblems in a systematic fashion; and these problems are far from dull oruninteresting. 1.5 Questions 1. In Syldavia the economists nd that (annual) household consumption cis related to (annual) income yby the formula c=\u00b7+y, where \u00b7>0 and 0 <<1. Because of this, they argue, inequality of consumption must be less than inequality of income. Provide an intu-itive argument for this. 2. Ruritanian society consists of three groups of people: Artists, Bureau- crats and Chocolatiers. Each Artist has high income (15,000 RuritanianMarks) with a 50 per cent probability, and low income (5000 RM) with50 per cent probability. Each Bureaucrat starts working life on a salaryof 5000 RM and then benets from an annual increment of 250 RMover the 40 years of his (perfectly safe) career. Chocolatiers get a straightannual wage of 10,000 RM. Discuss the extent of inequality in Ruritaniaaccording to annual income and lifetime income concepts. 3. In Borduria the government statistical service uses an inequality index that in principle can take any value greater than or equal to 0. You wantto introduce a transformed inequality index that is ordinally equivalentto the original but that will always lie between zero and 1. Which of thefollowing will do? I I+1,/radicalbigg I I+1,I I1, I. 4. Methods for analysing inequality of income could be applied to inequal- ity of use of specic health services (Williams and Doessel 2006). Whatwould be the principal problems of trying to apply these methods toinequality of health status ? 5. After a detailed study of a small village, government experts reckon that the poverty line is 100 rupees a month. In January a joint teamfrom the Ministry of Food and the Central Statistical Ofce carry outa survey of living standards in the village: the income for each villager(in rupees per month) is recorded. In April the survey team repeats the 14First Principles exercise. The number of villagers was exactly the same as in January,and villagers' incomes had changed only slightly. An extract from theresults is as follows: January April ... 104 ... ...... ... (the dots indicate the incomes of all the other villagers for whomincome did not change at all from January to April). The Ministry ofFood writes a report claiming that poverty has fallen in the village;the Central Statistical Ofce writes a report claiming that inequalityhas risen in the village. Can they both be right? (See Thon 1979, 1981,1983b for more on this.) 6. In Fantasia there is a debate about educational policy. The current situation is that there are two equal-sized groups of people, the Dark-greys who all get an income of $200, and the Light-greys who all getan income of $600, as in the top part of the accompanying diagram,labelled 'Parents'. One group of educational experts argue that if theFantasian government adopts policy A then the future outcome for thenext generation will be as shown on the left side of the diagram, labelled Parents Parents 600 400 200 0(a) (b) 1,400 1,200 1,000 800$ Children Children 600 400 200 0 1,400 1,200 1,000 800$ 600 400 200 0 1,400 1,200 1,000 800$600 400 200 0 1,400 1,200 1,000 800$ FIG.1 . 3 . Alternative policies for Fantasia 15Measuring Inequality 'Children'; another group of experts argue that if policy B is adopted,the outcome for the next generation will be that on the right side of thediagram (shading shows are used to show whether the children comefrom Dark-grey families or Light-grey families). According to your view:rWhich of policies A and B would produce lower inequality of out-come? rWhich policy produces higher social mobility? rWhich policy is characterized by lower inequality of opportunity? 162 Charting Inequality F . Scott Fitzgerald: 'The rich are different from us.' Ernest Hemingway: 'Yes, they have more money.' If society really did consist of two or three fairly homogeneous groups,economists and others could be saved a lot of trouble. We could then simplylook at the division of income between landlords and peasants, among work-ers, capitalists, and rentiers, or any other appropriate sections. Naturally wewould still be faced with such fundamental issues as how much each groupshould possess or receive, whether the statistics are reliable, and so on, butquestions such as 'what is the income distribution?' could be satisfactorilymet with a snappy answer '65 per cent to wages, 35 per cent to prots'. Ofcourse matters are not that simple. As we have argued, we want a way oflooking at inequality that reflects both the depth of poverty of the 'havenots' of society and the height of well-being of the 'haves': it is not easy todo this just by looking at the income accruing to, or the wealth possessedby, two or three groups. So in this chapter we will look at several quite well-known ways of pre- senting inequality in a large heterogeneous group of people. They are allmethods of appraising the sometimes quite complicated information that iscontained in an income distribution, and they can be grouped under threebroad headings: diagrams, inequality measures, and rankings. To make theexposition easier I shall continue to refer to 'income distribution', but youshould bear in mind, of course, that the principles can be carried over to thedistribution of any other variable that you can measure and that you thinkis of economic interest. 17Measuring Inequality 2.1 Diagrams Putting information about income distribution into diagrammatic form isa particularly instructive way of representing some of the basic ideas aboutinequality. There are several useful ways of representing inequality in pic-tures; the four that I shall discuss are introduced in the accompanying box.Let us have a closer look at each of them. /squareParade of Dwarfs /squareFrequency distribution /squareLorenz curve /squareLog transformation PICTURES OF INEQUALITY Jan Pen's Parade of Dwarfs is one of the most persuasive and attractive visual aids in the subject of income distribution. Suppose that everyone inthe population had a height proportional to his or her income, with theperson on average income being endowed with average height. Line peopleup in order of height and let them march past in some given time interval\u2014let us say one hour. Then the sight that would meet our eyes is represented bythe curve in Fig. 2.1. 1The whole parade passes in the interval represented by OC. But we do not meet the person with average income until we get to thepoint B (when well over half the parade has gone by). Divide total income bytotal population: this gives average or mean income ( \u00af y) and is represented by the height OA. We have oversimplied Pen's original diagram by excludingfrom consideration people with negative reported incomes, which wouldinvolve the curve crossing the base line towards its left-hand end. And, inorder to keep the diagram on the page, we have plotted the last point of thecurve (D) in a position that would be far too low in practice. This diagram highlights the presence of any extremely large incomes and, to a certain extent, abnormally small incomes. But we may have reservationsabout the degree of detail that it seems to impart concerning middle incomereceivers. We shall see this point recur when we use this diagram to derivean inequality measure that informs us about changes in the distribution. Frequency distributions are well-tried tools of statisticians, and are discussed here mainly for the sake of completeness and as an introduction for thoseunfamiliar with the concept\u2014for a fuller account see the references cited in 1Those with especially sharp eyes will see that the source is more than 20 years old. There is a good reason for using these data\u2014see the notes on page 180. 18Charting \u00a320,000 \u00a315,000Income \u00a310,000 A Q 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Proportion of populationB O C FIG.2 . 1 . The Parade of Dwarfs UK income before tax, 1984/5 Source :Economic Trends , November 1987 the notes to this chapter. An example is found in Fig. 2.2. Suppose you werelooking down on a eld. On one side, the axis Oy, there is a long straight fence marked off by income categories: the physical distance between anytwo points along the fence directly corresponds to the income differencesthey represent. Then, get the whole population to come into the eld andline up in the strip of land marked off by the piece of fence correspondingto their income bracket. So the \u00a310,000-to-\u00a312,500-a-year persons stand onthe shaded patch. The shape that you get will resemble the stepped line inFig. 2.2\u2014called a histogram\u2014which represents the frequency distribution. Itmay be that we regard this as an empirical observation of a theoretical curvewhich describes the income distribution, for example the smooth curvedrawn in Fig. 2.2. The relationship f(y) charted by this curve is sometimes 19Measuring Inequality f(y) This area represents 1,000,000 income-receiving units unitsFrequency Income\u00a30y AO \u00a32,500\u00a35,000\u00a37,500 . 2 . Frequency distribution of income Source :a s f o r F i g . 2 . 1 known as a density function where the scale is chosen such that the area under the curve and above the line Oy is standardized at unity. The frequency distribution shows the middle income ranges more clearly. But perhaps it is not so readily apparent what is going on in the upper tail;indeed, in order to draw the gure, we have deliberately made the lengthof the fence much too short. (On the scale of this diagram it ought to be100 metres at least!) This diagram and the Parade of Dwarfs are, however,intimately related; and we show this by constructing Fig. 2.3 from Fig. 2.2.The horizontal scale of each gure is identical. On the vertical scale of Fig.2.3 we plot 'cumulative frequency' written F(y), which is proportional to the area under the curve and to the left of yin Fig. 2.2. If you experiment with the diagram you will see that as you increase y,F(y) usually goes up (it can never decrease)\u2014from a value of zero when you start at the lowest incomereceived, up to a value of one for the highest income. Thus, supposing weconsider y=\u00a3 3 0 ,000, we plot a point in Fig. 2.3 that corresponds to the proportion of the population with \u00a330, 000 or less. And we can repeat this operation for every point on either the empirical curve or on the smooththeoretical curve. The visual relationship between Figs 2.1 and 2.3 is now obvious. As a further point of reference, the position of mean income has been drawn 20Charting Inequality 1 0.8 frequency distribution Source :a s f o r F i g . 2 . 1 in at the point Ain the two gures. (If you still don't see it, try turning the page round!) The Lorenz curve was introduced in 1905 as a powerful method of illustrat- ing the inequality of wealth distribution. A simplied explanation of it runsas follows. Once again, line up everybody in ascending order of incomes and let them parade by. Measure F(y), the proportion of people who have passed by, along the horizontal axis of Fig. 2.4. Once point C is reached everyone has gone by,soF(y) = 1. Now as each person passes, hand him his share of the 'cake'\u2014 that is, the proportion of total income that he receives. When the paradereaches people with income y, let us suppose that a proportion /Phi1(y)o ft h e cake has gone. So of course when F(y)=0 , /Phi1(y) is also 0 (no cake gone); and when F(y)=1 , /Phi1(y) is also 1 (all the cake has been handed out). /Phi1(y)i s measured on the vertical scale in Fig. 2.4, and the graph of /Phi1plotted against Fis the Lorenz curve. Note that it is always convex toward the point C, the reason for which is easy to see. Suppose that the rst 10 per cent have led by(F(y 1)=0.1) and you have handed out 4 per cent of the cake ( /Phi1(y1)=0.04); then by the time the next 10 per cent of the people go by ( F(y2)=0.2), you must have handed out at least 8 per cent of the cake ( /Phi1(y2)=0.08). Why? Because we arranged the parade in ascending order of cake-receivers. Noticetoo that if the Lorenz curve lay along OD we would have a state of perfect 21Measuring Inequality 1.0D 0.8(y) 0.6 0.4 Proportion of income0.5 0.2P =L(F) OC 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Proportion of populationF(y)B H FIG.2 . 4 . Lorenz curve of income Source :a s f o r F i g . 2 . 1 equality, for along that line the rst 5 per cent get 5 per cent of the cake, therst 10 per cent get 10 per cent . . . and so on. The Lorenz curve incorporates some principles that are generally regarded as fundamental to the theory of inequality measurement, as we will see laterin this chapter (page 34) and also in Chapter 3 (pages 46 and 62). And againthere is a nice relationship with Fig. 2.1. If we plot the slope of the Lorenzcurve against the cumulative population proportions, F, then we are back precisely to the Parade of Dwarfs (scaled so that mean income equals unity).Once again, to facilitate comparison, the position where we meet the personwith mean income has been marked as point B, although in the Lorenz diagram we cannot represent mean income itself. Note that the mean occursat a value of Fsuch that the slope of the Lorenz curve is parallel to OD. Logarithmic transformation . An irritating problem that arises in drawing the frequency curve of Fig. 2.2 is that we must either ignore some of the verylarge incomes in order to t the diagram on the page, or put up with a 22Charting Inequality diagram that obscures much of the detail in the middle and lower incomeranges. We can avoid this to some extent by drawing a similar frequencydistribution, but plotting the horizontal axis on a logarithmic scale as inFig. 2.5. Equal distances along the horizontal axis correspond to equal pro-portionate income differences. Again the point corresponding to mean income, \u00af y, has been marked in as A. Note that the length OA equals log( \u00af y) and is not the mean of the logarithms of income. This is marked in as the point A /prime, so that the length OA/prime=l o g ( y) where yis the geometric mean of the distribution. Assuming incomes are non-negative, the geometric mean, found by taking the meanof the logarithms and then transforming back to natural numbers, can neverexceed the conventional arithmetic mean. We have now seen four different ways of presenting pictorially the same facts about income distribution. Evidently each graphical technique mayemphasize quite different features of the distribution: the Parade drawsattention to the enormous height of the well-off; the frequency curvepresents middle incomes more clearly, the logarithmic transformation cap-tures information from each of the 'tails' as well as the middle, but at thesame time sacrices simplicity and ease of interpretation.

A few of the more important ones that weshall encounter are listed in the accompanying box. Of course, an inequalitymeasure, like any other tool, is to be judged by the kind of job that it does: isit suitably sensitive to changes in the pattern of distribution? Does it respondappropriately to changes in the overall scale of incomes? As we go throughthe items in the box we will briefly consider their principal properties: (aproper job must wait until page 67, after we have considered the importantanalytical points introduced in Chapter 3). /square Range R /square Relative mean deviation M /square G /square Log variance v INEQUALITY MEASURES The Parade of Dwarfs suggests the rst two of these. First, we have the range, which we dene simply as the distance CD in Fig. 2.1 or: R=ymaxymin, where ymax and ymin are, respectively, the maximum and minimum values of income in the parade (we may, of course, standardize by considering R/ymin or R/\u00afy). Plato apparently had this concept in mind when he made the following judgement: We maintain that if a state is to avoid the greatest plague of all\u2014I mean civil war,though civil disintegration would be a better term\u2014extreme poverty and wealthmust not be allowed to arise in any section of the citizen-body, because bothlead to both these disasters. That is why the legislator must now announce theacceptable limits of wealth and poverty. The lower limit of poverty must be the 24Charting Inequality value of the holding. The legislator will use the holding as his unit of measureand allow a man to possess twice, thrice, and up to four times its value. The Laws, 745. The problems with the range are evident. Although it might be satisfactory in a small closed society where everyone's income is known fairly certainly,it is clearly unsuited to large, heterogeneous societies where the 'minimum'and 'maximum' incomes can at best only be guessed. The measure will behighly sensitive to the guesses or estimates of these two extreme values. Inpractice one might try to get around the problem by using a related conceptthat is more robust: take the gap between the income of the person whoappears exactly at, say, the end of the rst three minutes in the Parade, andthat of the person exactly at the 57th minute (the bottom 5 per cent andthe top 5 per cent of the line of people) or the income gap between thepeople at the 6th and 54th minute (the bottom 10 per cent and the top10 per cent of the line of people). However, even if we did that there is a morecompelling reason for having doubts about the usefulness of R. Suppose we can wave a wand and bring about a society where the person at position Oand the person at position C are left at the same height, but where everyoneelse in between was levelled to some equal, intermediate height. We wouldprobably agree that inequality had been reduced, though not eliminated.But according to Rit is just the same! You might be wondering whether the problem with Rarises because it ignores much of the information about the distribution (it focuses just on acouple of extreme incomes). Unfortunately we shall nd a similar criticismin subtle form attached to the second inequality measure that we can readoff the Parade diagram, one that uses explicitly the income values of allthe individuals. This is the relative mean deviation, which is dened as the average absolute distance of everyone's income from the mean, expressed asa proportion of the mean. Take a look at the shaded portions in Fig. 2.1.These portions, which are necessarily of equal size, constitute the areabetween the Parade curve itself and the horizontal line representing meanincome. In some sense, the larger this area, the greater is inequality. (Trydrawing the Parade with more giants and more dwarfs.) It is conventional tostandardize the inequality measure in unit-free terms, so let us divide by thetotal income (which equals area OCGA). In terms of the diagram the relativemean deviation is then: 2 M=area OAQ + area QGD area OCGA. 2You are invited to check the technical appendix (p. 153) for formal denitions of this and other inequality measures. 25Measuring Inequality yD A Q G BC O FIG.2 . 6 . The Parade with partial equalization But now for the fatal weakness of M. Suppose you think that the stature of the dwarfs to the left of Bis socially unacceptable. You arrange a reallocation of income so that everyone with incomes below the mean (to the left ofpoint B) has exactly the same income. The modied parade then looks like Fig. 2.6. But notice that the two shaded regions in Fig. 2.6 are exactlythe same area as in Fig. 2.1: so the value of Mhas not changed. Whatever reallocation you arrange among people to the left of Bonly, or among people to the right of Bonly, inequality according to the relative mean deviation stays the same. The relative mean deviation can be easily derived from the Lorenz curve (Fig. 2.4). From the Technical Appendix, page 156, it can be veried that M=2 [ F(\u00afy)/Phi1(\u00afy)], that is: M=2 [ O B BP]. However, a more common use of the Lorenz curve diagram is to derive the Gini coefcient ,G, expressed as the ratio of the shaded area in Fig. 2.4 to the area OCD. There is a varietyof equivalent ways of dening G; but perhaps the easiest denition is as the average difference between all possible pairs of incomes in the population,expressed as a proportion of total income: see pages 155 and 156 for a formaldenition. The main disadvantage of Gis that it places a rather curious implicit relative value on changes that may occur in different parts of thedistribution. An income transfer from a relatively rich person to a personwith \u00a3 xless has a much greater effect on Gif the two persons are near the 26Charting Inequality middle rather than at either end of the parade.3So, consider transferring \u00a31 from a person with \u00a310,100 to a person with \u00a310,000. This has a muchgreater effect on reducing Gthan transferring \u00a31 from a person with \u00a31,100 to one with \u00a31,000 or than transferring \u00a31 from a person with \u00a3100,100 to aperson with \u00a3100,000. This valuation may be desirable, but it is not obviousthat it is desirable: this point about the valuation of transfers is discussedmore fully in Chapter 3 once we have discussed social welfare explicitly. Other inequality measures can be derived from the Lorenz curve in Fig. 2.4. Two have been suggested in connection with the problem of measuringinequality in the distribution of power, as reflected in voting strength. First,consider the income level y 0at which half the national cake has been distributed to the parade; that is, /Phi1(y0)=1 2. Then dene the minimal majority inequality measure as F(y0), which is the distance OH. If /Phi1is reinterpreted as the proportion of seats in an elected assembly where the votes are spreadunevenly among the constituencies, as reflected by the Lorenz curve, and if Fis reinterpreted as a proportion of the electorate, then 1 F(y 0) represents the smallest proportion of the electorate that can secure a majority in theelected assembly. Second, we have the equal shares coefcient, dened as F(\u00afy): the proportion of the population that has income \u00af yor less (the distance OB), or the proportion of the population that has 'average voting strength' or less.Clearly, either of these measures as applied to the distribution of incomeor wealth is subject to essentially the same criticism as the relative meandeviation: they are insensitive to transfers among members of the Paradeon the same side of the person with income y 0(in the case of the minimal majority measure) or \u00af y(the equal shares coefcient): in effect they measure changes in inequality by only recording transfers between two broadly basedgroups. Now let us consider Figs 2.2 and 2.5: the frequency distribution and its log-transformation. An obvious suggestion is to measure inequality in thesame way as statisticians measure dispersion of any frequency distribution.In this application, the usual method would involve measuring the distancebetween the individual's income y iand mean income \u00af y, squaring this, and then nding the average of the resulting quantity in the whole population.Assuming that there are npeople we dene the variance: 3To see why, check the denition of Gon page 155 and note the formula for the 'Transfer Effect' (right-hand column). Now imagine persons iand jlocated at two points yiand yj,a given distance xapart, along the fence described on page 19; if there are lots of other persons in the part of the eld between those two points then the transfer-effect formula tells us that theimpact of a transfer from ito jwill be large ( F/parenleftbig y j/parenrightbig F(yi)is a large number) and vice versa. It so happens that real-world frequency distributions of income look like that in Fig. 2.2 (witha peak in the mid-income range rather than at either end), so that two income receivers, \u00a3100apart, have many people between them if they are located in the mid-income range, but ratherfew people between them if located at one end or other. 27Measuring Inequality V=1 nn/summationdisplay i=1[yi\u00afy]2. (2.1) However, Vis unsatisfactory in that were we simply to double everyone's incomes (and thereby double mean income and leave the shape of thedistribution essentially unchanged), Vwould quadruple. One way round this problem is to standardize V. Dene the coefcient of variation thus c= V \u00afy. (2.2) Another way to avoid this problem is to look at the variance in terms of the logarithms of income\u2014to apply the transformation illustrated in Fig. 2.5before evaluating the inequality measure. In fact there are of these we will call the logarithmic variance, and the second we may more properly term the variance of the logarithms of incomes. Note that vis dened relative to the logarithm of mean income; v1is dened relative to the mean of the logarithm of income . Either denition is invariant under proportional increases in all incomes. We shall nd that v1has much to recommend it when we come to examine the lognormal distribution in Chapter 4. However, c,v,a n dv 1can be criti- cized more generally on grounds similar to those on which Gwas criticized. Consider a transfer of \u00a31 from a person with yto a person with y\u00a3100. How does this transfer affect these inequality measures? In the case of c,i t does not matter in the slightest where in the parade this transfer is effected:so whether the transfer is from a person with \u00a3500 to a person with \u00a3400, orfrom a person with \u00a3100,100 to a person with \u00a3100,000, the reduction in c is exactly the same. Thus cwill be particularly good at capturing inequality among high incomes, but may be of more limited use in reflecting inequalityelsewhere in the distribution. In contrast to this property of c, there appears to be good reason to suggest that a measure of inequality has the propertythat a transfer of the above type carried out in the low income bracketswould be quantitatively more effective in reducing inequality than if thetransfer were carried out in the high income brackets. The measures vandv 1 appear to go some way towards meeting this objection. Taking the exampleof the UK in 1984/5 (illustrated in Figs 2.1 to 2.5 where we have \u00af y= \u00a37,522), 28Charting Inequality a transfer of \u00a31 from a person with \u00a310,100 to a person with \u00a310,000 reducesvandv 1less than a transfer of \u00a31 from a person with \u00a3500 to a person with \u00a3400. But, unfortunately, vandv1'overdo' this effect, so to speak. For if we consider a transfer from a person with \u00a3100,100 to a person with \u00a3100,000then inequality, as measured by vorv 1, increases! This is hardly a desirable property for an inequality measure to possess, even if it does occur only athigh incomes. 4 Other statistical properties of the frequency distribution may be pressed into service as inequality indices. While these may draw attention to partic-ular aspects of inequality\u2014such as dispersion among the very high or verylow incomes, by and large they miss the point as far as general inequalityof incomes is concerned. Consider, for example, measures of skewness. Forsymmetric distributions (such as the Normal distribution, pictured on page81) these measures are zero; but this zero value of the measure may beconsistent with either a very high or a very low dispersion of incomes (asmeasured by the coefcient of variation). This does not appear to capturethe essential ideas of inequality measurement. Figure 2.2 can be used to derive an inequality measure from quite a different source. Stark (1972) argued that an appropriate practical method ofmeasuring inequality should be based on society's revealed judgements onthe denition of poverty and riches. The method is best seen by redrawingFig. 2.2 as Fig. 2.7. Stark's study concentrated specically on UK incomes, butthe idea it embodies seems intuitively very appealing and could be appliedmore generally. The distance OP in Fig. 2.7 we will call the range of 'lowincomes': P could have been xed with reference to the income level atwhich a person becomes entitled to income support, adjusted for need, orwith reference to some proportion of average income 5\u2014this is very similar to the specication of a 'poverty line'. The point R could be determined bythe level at which one becomes liable to any special taxation levied on therich, again adjusted for need. 6The high-low index is then total shaded area between the curve and the horizontal axis. The high-low index seems imaginative and practical, but it suffers from three important weaknesses. First, it is subject to exactly the same type ofcriticism that we levelled against M, and against the 'minimal majority' and 'equal share' measures: the measure is completely insensitive to transfersamong the 'poor' (to the left of P), among the 'rich' (to the right of R), or 4You will always get this trouble if the 'poorer' of the two persons has at least 2.72 times mean income, in this case \u00a320, 447\u2014see the Technical Appendix, page 164. 5In Fig. 2.7 it has been located at half median income\u2014check Question 1 on page 37 if you are unsure about how to dene the median. 6Note that in a practical application the positions of both P and R depend on family com- position. This however is a point which we are deferring until later. Figure 2.7 illustrates onetype. 29Measuring Inequality approach among 'middle income receivers'. Second, there is an awkward dilemmaconcerning the behaviour of points P and R over time. Suppose one leavesthem xed in relative terms, so that OP and OR increase only at the samerate as mean or median income increases over time. Then one faces thecriticism that one's current criterion for measuring inequality is based onan arbitrary standard xed, perhaps, a quarter of a century ago. On theother hand, suppose that OP and OR increase with year-to-year increases insome independent reference income levels (the 'income-support' thresholdfor point P and the 'higher-rate tax' threshold for point R): then, if theinequality measure shows a rising trend because of more people falling in the'low income' category, one must face the criticism that this is just an opticalillusion created by altering, for example, the denition of 'poor' people;some compromise between the two courses must be chosen and the resultsderived for a particular application treated with caution. 7Third, there is the point that in practice the contribution of the shaded area in the upper tail to 7There is a further complication in the specic UK application considered by Stark. He xed point P using the basic national assistance (later supplementary benet) scale plus a percentageto allow for underestimation of income and income disregarded in applying for assistance(benet); point R was xed by the point at which one became liable for surtax. However, nationalassistance, supplementary benet, and surtax are no more. Other politically or socially dened Pand R points could be determined for other times and other countries; but the basic problem ofcomparisons over time that I have highlighted would remain. So too, of course, would problemsof comparisons between countries. 30Charting Inequality the inequality measure would be negligible: the behaviour of the inequalitymeasure would be driven by what happens in the lower tail\u2014which may ormay not be an acceptable feature\u2014and would simplify effectively to whetherpeople 'fall in' on the right or on the left of point P when we arrange them inthe frequency distribution diagram (Figs 2.2 and 2.7). In effect the high-lowinequality index would become a slightly modied poverty index. The use of any one of the measures we have discussed in this section implies certain value judgements concerning the way we compare one per-son's income against that of another. The detail of such judgements will beexplained in the next chapter, although we have already seen a glimpse ofsome of the issues. 2.3 Rankings Finally, we consider ways of looking at inequality that may lead to ambigu-ous results. Let me say straight away that this sort of non-decisive approachis not necessarily a bad thing. As we noted in Chapter 1 it may be helpful toknow that over a particular period events have altered the income distribu-tion in such a way that we nd offsetting effects on the amount of inequality.The inequality measures that we have examined in the previous section actas 'tie-breakers' in such an event. Each inequality measure resolves the ambi-guity in its own particular way. Just how we should resolve these ambiguities i st a k e nu pi nm o r ed e t a i li nC h a p t e r3 . /square Quantiles /square Shares TYPES OF RANKING The two types of ranking on which we are going to focus are highlighted in the accompanying box. To anticipate the discussion a little I should pointout that these two concepts are not really new to this chapter, because theyeach have a simple interpretation in terms of the pictures that we werelooking at earlier. In fact I could have labelled the items in the box as Paraderankings and Lorenz rankings. We have already encountered quantiles when we were discussing the incomes of the 3rd and 57th minute people as an alternative to the range, R(page 25). Quantiles are best interpreted using either the Parade diagram or its equivalent, the cumulative frequency distribution (Fig. 2.3). Take theParade diagram and reproduce it in Fig. 2.8 (the parade of Fig. 2.1 is the solid 31Measuring Inequality \u00a340,000y \u00a330,000\u00a335,000 \u00a325,000 . 8 . The Parade and the quantile ranking curve labelled 1984/5; we will come to the other two curves in a moment).Mark the point 0.2 on the horizontal axis, and read off the correspondingincome on the vertical axis: this gives the 20 per cent quantile (usually known as the rst quintile just to confuse you): the income at the right-hand end of the rst fth (12 minutes) of the Parade of Dwarfs. Figure 2.8 also showshow we can do the same for the 80 per cent quantile (the top quintile). Ingeneral we specify a p-quantile\u2014which I will write Q p\u2014as follows. Form the Parade of Dwarfs and take the leading proportion pof the Parade (where of course 0 p1), then Qpis the particular income level which demarcates the right-hand end of this section of the Parade.8 8A note on 'iles'. The generic term is 'quantile'\u2014which applies to any specied population proportion p\u2014but a number of special names for particular convenient cases are in use. There is the median Q 0.5, and a few standard sets such as three quartiles ( Q0.25,Q0.5,Q0.75), four quintiles (Q0.2,Q0.4,Q0.6,Q0.8) or nine deciles ( of course you can specify as many other 'standard' sets of quantiles as your patience and your knowledgeof Latin prexes permits. I have avoided using the term 'quantile group', that is sometimes found in the literature, which refers to a slice of the population demarcated by two quantiles. For example the slice of thepopulation with incomes at least as great as Q 0.1but less than Q0.2could be referred to as the 'second decile group'. I have avoided the term because it could be confusing. However, you mayalso nd references to such a slice of the population as 'the second decile': this usage is not justconfusing, it is wrong; the quantiles are the points on the income scale, not the slices of the population that may be located between the points. 32Charting Inequality Q0.9/Q0.5 Q0.75/Q0.5 Quantile ratios of earnings of adult men, UK 1968-2007 Source : Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings How might we use a set of quantiles to compare income distributions? We could produce something like Fig. 2.9, which shows the proportionatemovements of the quantiles of the frequency distribution of earnings in theUK in recent years (the diagram has been produced by standardizing themovements of Q 0.1,Q0.25,Q0.75,a n d Q0.9, by the median, Q0.5). We then check whether the quantiles are moving closer together or farther apart overtime. But although the kind of moving apart that we see at the right-handof Fig. 2.9 appears to indicate greater dispersion, it is not clear that thisnecessarily means greater inequality: the movement of the correspondingincome shares (which we discuss in a moment) could in principle be tellingus a different story. 9 However, we might also be interested in the simple quantile ranking of the distributions, which focuses on the absolute values of the quantiles, ratherthan quantile ratios. For example, suppose that over time all the quantilesof the distribution increase by 30 per cent as shown by the curve labelled'hypothetical' in Fig. 2.8 (in the jargon we then say that according to thequantile ranking the new distribution dominates the old one). Then we might say 'there are still lots of dwarfs about', to which the reply might be 'yes butat least everybody is a bit taller'. Even if we cannot be specic about whetherthis means that there is more or less inequality as a result, the phenomenon 9In case this is not obvious, consider a population with just 8 people in it: in year A the income distribution is (2 ,3,3,4,5,6,6,7), and it is fairly obvious that Q0.25=3 a n d Q0.75=6 ; in year B the distribution becomes (0 ,4,4,4,5,5,5,9) and we can see now that Q0.25=4 a n d Q0.75= 5. Mean income and median income have remained unchanged and the quartiles have narrowed: but has inequality really gone down? The story from the shares suggests otherwise:the share of the bottom 25 per cent has actually fallen (from 5 /36 to 4/36) and the share of the top 25 per cent has risen (from 13 /36 to 14/36). 33Measuring Inequality of a clear quantile ranking is telling us something interesting about theincome distribution which we will discuss more in the next chapter. On theother hand if we were to compare 1981/2 and 1984/5 in Fig. 2.8 we wouldhave to admit that over the three year period the giants became a little taller(Q 0.8increased slightly), but the dwarfs became even shorter ( Q0.2decreased slightly): the 1984/5 distribution does not dominate that for 1981/2. Shares by contrast are most easily interpreted in terms of Fig. 2.4. An interesting question to ask ourselves in comparing two income distributionsis: does the Lorenz curve of one lie wholly 'inside' (closer to the line ofperfect equality) than that of the other? If it does, then we would probablynd substantial support for the view that the 'inside' curve represents a moreevenly-spread distribution. To see this point take a look at Fig. 2.10, andagain do an exercise similar to that which we carried out for the quantilesin Fig. 2.8: for reference let us mark in the share that would accrue to thebottom 20 per cent and to the bottom 80 per cent in distribution B (whichis the distribution before tax\u2014the same as the Lorenz curve that we had inFig. 2.4)\u2014this yields the blobs on the vertical axis. Now suppose we lookat the Lorenz curve marked A, which depicts the distribution for after tax 1.0 0.8(y) 0.6Before tax After tax 0.4A 0.2 Proportion of income 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Proportion of populationF(y)B FIG. 2.10. Ranking by shares. UK 1984/5 incomes before and after tax Source :a s f o r F i g . 2 . 1 34Charting Inequality income. As we might have expected, Fig. 2.10 shows that people in thebottom 20 per cent would have received a larger slice of the after-tax cake(curve A) than they used to get in B. So also those in the bottom 80 per centreceived a larger proportionate slice of the A-cake than their proportionateslice of the B-cake (which of course is equivalent to saying that the richest20 per cent gets a smaller proportionate slice in A than it received in B). It is clear from the gure that we could have started with any other referencepopulation proportions and obtained the same type of answer: whatever'bottom proportion' of people F(y) is selected, this group gets a larger share of the cake /Phi1(y) in A than in B (according to the shares ranking, A dominates B). Moreover, it so happens that whenever this kind of situation arises all theinequality measures that we have presented (except just perhaps vandv 1) will indicate that inequality has gone down. However, quite often this sort of neat result does not apply. If the Lorenz curves intersect, then the shares-ranking principle cannot tell us whetherinequality is higher or lower, whether it has increased or decreased. Eitherwe accept this outcome with a shrug of the shoulders, or we have to use atie-breaker. This situation is illustrated in Fig. 2.11, which depicts the way inwhich the distribution of income after tax changed from 1981/2 to 1984/5.Notice that the bottom 20 per cent of the population did proportionately 1.0 0.8(y) 0.61981/2 1984/5 0.4 0.2 Proportion of income 0.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Proportion of populationF(y) FIG.2 . 1 1 . 1984/5 0.4 FIG.2 . 1 2 .

We shall have a lot more to say about this kind of situation inChapter 3. 2.4 From charts to analysis We have seen how quite a large number of ad hoc inequality measures are associated with various diagrams that chart inequality, which are themselvesinterlinked. But, however appealing each of these pictorial representationsmight be, we seem to nd important reservations about any of the associatedinequality measures. Perhaps the most unsatisfactory aspect of all of these 36Charting Inequality indices is that the basis for using them is indeed ad hoc : the rationale for using them was based on intuition and a little graphical serendipity. Whatwe really need is proper theoretical basis for comparing income distributionsand for deciding what constitutes a 'good' inequality measure. This is where the ranking techniques that we have been considering come in particularly useful. Although they are indecisive in themselves, they yetprovide a valuable introduction to the deeper analysis of inequality measure-ment to be found in the next chapter. 2.5 Questions 1. Explain how to represent median income in Pen's Parade. How would you represent the upper and lower quartiles? (See footnote 8). 2. Describe how the following would look: (a) Pen's Parade with negative incomes. (b) The Lorenz curve if there were some individuals with negative incomes but mean income was still positive. (c) The Lorenz curve if there were so many individuals with negative incomes that mean income itself was negative. (See the TechnicalAppendix, page 169, for more on this.) 3. DeNavas-Walt et al. (2008) present a convenient summary of United States' income distribution data based on the Annual Social andEconomic Supplement to the 2008 Current Population Survey.(a) How would the information in their Table A-1 need to be adapted in order to produce charts similar to Fig. 2.2? (b) Use the information in Table A-3 to construct Pen's Parade for 1967, 1987, 2007: how does the Parade appear to have shifted over40 years? (c) Use the information in Table A-3 to construct the Lorenz curves for 1967, 1987, 2007: what has happened to inequality over theperiod? (Document is available on-line using the link on the websitehttp://darp.lse.ac.uk/MI3) 4. Reconstruct the histogram for the UK 1984/5, before tax income, using the le 'ET income distribution' on the website (see the TechnicalAppendix page 177 for guidance on how to use the le). Now mergeadjacent pairs of intervals (so that, for example, the intervals [\u00a30,\u00a32000]and [\u00a32000,\u00a33000] become [\u00a30,\u00a33000]) and redraw the histogram: com-ment on your ndings. 5. Using the same data source for the UK 1984/5, before-tax income, con- struct the distribution function corresponding to the histogram drawnin Question 4. Now, instead of assuming that the distribution of income 37Measuring Inequality follows the histogram shape, assume that within each income intervalall income receivers get the mean income of that interval. Again drawthe distribution function. Why does it look like a flight of steps? 6. Suppose a country's tax and benet system operates so that taxes payable are determined by the formula t[yy 0] where yis the person's original (pre-tax) income, tis the marginal t a xr a t ea n d y0is a threshold income. Persons with incomes below y0receive a net payment from the government ('negative tax'). If the distribution of original income is y1,y2,..., yn, use the formulas given in the Technical Appendix (page 155) to write down the coefcient ofvariation and the Gini coefcient for after tax income. Comment onyour results. 7. Suppose the income distribution before tax is represented by a set of numbers {y (1),y(2),..., y(n)}, where y(1)y(2)y(3)....W r i t ed o w na n expression for the Lorenz curve. If the tax system were to be of theform given in Question 6, what would be the Lorenz curve of dispos-able (after-tax) income? Will it lie above the Lorenz curve for originalincome? (For further discussion of the point here, see Jakobsson 1976and Eichhorn et al. 1984.) 8. (a) Ruritania consists of six districts that are approximately of equal size in terms of population. In 2007 per-capita incomes mean income for the Rural districts, for the Urbandistricts, and for the whole of Ruritania. Compute the logarithmicvariance, the relative mean deviation, and the Gini coefcient forthe Rural districts and the Urban districts separately and for thewhole of Ruritania. (You will nd that these are easily adaptedfrom the le 'East-West' on the website, and you should ignore anyincome differences within any one district.) (b) By 2008 the per-capita income distribution had part (a) for the 2008 data. Did inequal-ity rise or fall between 2007 and 2008?

Social states are judged by (and only by) individual welfare levels.

An important message of this version of welfarism is that, in assessing individual well-being,oneshouldavoidmakingjudgmentsthatareinconsistentwiththeprefer- ences that guide people's own choices.

But it does not stop there. \"Utility\" in economics is whatever people care about. To say that this only includes market com- modities is an unjustied specialization.1As long as markets exist and are deemed tobecompetitive,prevailingpricescanbeusedforaggregatingthecommoditiescon- sumedandindeflatingfordierencesinthecost-of-livingtoderivethewelfaremetric. However, this is a partial welfare metric to the extent that people also care about non-marketgoods. The utility-based approach draws on a model of rational consumer choice. The essenceoftheapproachistheideaofa utilityfunction (recallboxes1.4and1.9).This serves two distinct roles in utility-based welfarism. First, it is a convenient represen- tation of the consumer's preferences over her aordable consumption bundles. The consumer is presumed to be able to order those bundles from the best to the worst and pick the best among the feasible options. In this rst role, the utility function is nothing more than an analytically convenient way of representing the consumer's preferences.Box3.1summarizesthestandardmodel. Box3.1ConsumerChoice Each person is assumed to have a preference ordering over her budget set, dened as the set of all feasible consumption bundles (which can be taken to include leisure). To keep things simple, suppose that there are two goods, food andclothing,consumedintheamounts QFandQCwithprices PFandPC(\"F\"for 1Aswewillsee,somecritiquesofwelfarismhavebe enbasedonthatoverlynarrowspecialization; whilerelevantinsomecasesthesecritiqueslackmoregeneralvalidity.Measuring Welfare 133 food and \"C\" for clothing).

It is convenient and generally uncontentious to assume that the preference ordering can be represented by a continuous utility function, U(QF,QC), which is maximized subject to the budget constraint (and the time constraint if we added a third dimension of leisure). The utility function is normally assumed to trace out strictly convex indierence curves (Box 1.4). (Recall that the indif- ference curve gives the locus of all the combinations of the two choicevariables that attain a given level of utility.) The slope of the indierence curve is called themarginalrateofsubstitution (MRS),whichisdenedastheincrementtocon- sumptionofonegoodthatisneededtocompensateforonelessunitofanother good, while keeping utility constant.

That is true, but we can still use the idea to motivate welfare comparisons in more familiar mone- tary terms\u2014in the \"income space.\" However, we must then be condent that our measure based on the observables is calibrated to be consistent with our concept of utility. When it is a monetary measure and it is consistent with utility it is called a money-metric of utility (or sometimes equivalent income ). This can be readily dened in theory, by nding the income equivalent to utility at xed reference prices and personalcharacteristics.(Wereturntothisconceptinchapter4.) Arguablythebiggerproblemis heterogeneity acrosspeopleintheirwelfare-relevant non-market characteristics. People dier in the utility they can be expected to derive from a given consumption bundle. Some people have characteristics\u2014being elderly, or disabled, or living in a cold climate, or living in a place where public services are poor\u2014whereby they need more of certain market goods to attain the same level of utility. Given this heterogeneity, an interpersonally comparable utility index cannot be inferred by looking only at objectively measurable demand and supply behavior.

The basic modelassumesautilityfunctionthatdependsonthequantitiesconsumedofall goods and services and the leisure time left after working. (See box 3.1.) Recall that this function represents consumer preferences in that the utility function ranks commodity bundles identically with how the consumer ranks them. This utility function is then maximized subject to the budget constraint, which says thatthetotalexpenditureoncommoditiesplustheimputedvalueofleisuretime (time taken for leisure times the market wage rate) cannot exceed \"full income\" givenbythevalueofthetimeendowmentplusallotherincome(includingprots fromownenterprises). If demands and supplies are consistent with this model, then we can in general solve backwards from the observed demands and supplies of a given individualtorecoverautilityfunctionthatisconsistentwiththechoicesmade. When we come to compare people in dierent households, with dierent sizes and demographic compositions, and dierences in other characteristics (such as health and disability), we must allow the possibility that these dierences matter to both the observed demands and to the level of utility attained given thosedemands.However,wecannotexpectthatthewaysthosedierencesinflu- ence utility at given demands (and supplies) will be properly reflected in the observed demand and supply behavior.

Further reading: These issues are discussed further in Pollak and Wales (1979) andBrowning(1992). The upshot of these observations is that there is a deep problem in implementing the welfarist agenda that we should rely on the utility derived from consumer choice in deciding whether one person is better o than another. The problem stems from likely heterogeneity in the utility obtained from given choices. It is a \"deep\" problem becausemoredataonpeople'sactualchoiceswillnotmaketheproblemgoaway.Forall practicalpurposes,wewillneedtomakeexternaljudgmentsindecidingwhetherone person is better o than another. Again, this is not to say we should ignore the data on choices, but rather to say that we should not kid ourselves that this is sucient information.136 measures and methods In practice, policymakers, evaluators, and most applied economists today are willing to admit explicit interpersonal comparisons of utility between people or households withdierent characteristics when discussingpolicies, although typically t h e s ej u d gm e n t sa r el a r g e l yc o m i n gf r o mo u t s i d ee c o n o m i c s .(Th o s ee c o n o m i s t sw h o are not willing to admit such information are likely to be left out of informing the manyimportantpolicydebatesthatrequireinterpersonalcomparisons.)Itisgenerally understoodthatinthinkingaboutpolicy,onecanmakeinterpersonalcomparisonsof welfare yet respect personal preferences when relevant.

Can these alternative approaches help in identifying a reliable metric of welfare? Extensions and Alternatives to Welfarism Poverty assessments are sometimes based on certain elementary achievements\u2014 specicformsofdeprivation,suchasbeingabletoaordtobeadequatelynourished. One might count how many people do not attain specic nutritional requirements for good health and normal activities. Or one might identify a list of other specic deprivationsrelatedto(say)housingconditions,waterandsanitation,andownership of consumer durables.5No special role is assigned to consumer preferences in these approaches. Twoconcernsarise.First,thereisanaggingworryaboutthearbitrarinessindecid- ing what dimensions matter and (when necessary) how one should value one type of commodity (such as food) against another (clothing say). Second, there is a concern that these approaches can be overly paternalistic: experts are essentially saying that \"we know better than you about what is good for you.\" By ignoring preferences one may well decide that people are worse o after some policy change (say) even if the people concerned do not agree. For example, one can imagine relative price changes due to (say) an external trade reform that are unambiguously utility-increasing yet entail substitution eects that result in lower caloric intakes in the neighborhood of nutritional norms. A utility-based assessment will say there has been a gain while an observerconcernedonlywithnutritionalintakeswillnot.

This echoes the ideas of Rawls (1971), as discussed in chapter 2. We need some indextoidentifytheleastadvantagedgroup,basedonprimarycommodities.Itmight be enough to simply know that \"more is better,\" although more likely we can gure out who is poor. However, there are ways of addressingthisproblem,aswewillseeinchapter4. Once one recognizes the deciencies in available data, observations on spe- cic deprivations can have an important role within a broadly welfarist approach. Wereturntothispointinsection3.3. Capabilities An alternative to both the traditional utility-based approach and the specic- deprivations approach has been proposed by Amartya Sen.6Sen rejects \"utility\" as t h es o l em e t r i co fw e l f a r e ;h ea l s or e j e c t st h en o n - w e l f a r i s tf o r m u l a t i o n s ,s u c ha s thosethatfocussolelyonspeciccommodi tydeprivationsorincomealone.Recalling box 2.1, Sen argues instead that \"well-being\" is really to do with beingwell, which is about being able to live long, being well-nourished, being healthy, being literate, and soon;asSen(1987,25)putsit,the\"valueofthelivingstandardliesintheliving,and not in the possessing of commodities.\" In Sen's view, what is valued intrinsically are people'scapabilitiestofunction.\"P overty\"isalackofcapability . There has been much discussion of Sen's proposal over the last twenty-ve years.7It has come to be seen by many observers as the main competing theoret- ical foundation to the welfarist approach in economics. However, it is possible to interpret the capabilities approach in a way that is consistent with welfarism once one allows for heterogeneous preferences over commodities.8This only requires t h a to n et h i n k so fc a p a b i l i t i e sa st h ed i r e c tg e n e r a t o r so fu t i l i t y .Ap e r s o n ' su t i l i t yi s determined solely by her attainable functionings, which depend in turn on income, 6See,interalia,Sen(1980,1985a,1987,1992). 7TherewasanearlydebatebetweenSen(1979)andNg(1981).AlsoseeSen(1987)andthecom- mentsthereinbyKanburandMuellbauer.ForathoughtfuldefenseofwelfarismagainstSen'scritique, seeKaplow(2008,pt.5). 8Utility can the welfare-rele vant functionings\u2014the attainment of personal satisfaction through choice. This interpretati on is found in Sen (1992, ch. 3). But it is not common amongadvocatesofthecapabilitiesapproach.138 measures and methods thepricesfaced,andhercharacteristics.Box3.3discussesfurtherthisinterpretation of the capabilities approach. Some might still reject the view that welfare can be equatedwiththemaximandofpersonalchoice. Box3.3AWelfaristInterpretationofCapabilities In the standard economic model, welfare depends on the consumption of commodities but preferences over commodities may vary between people. Without loss of generality, we can think of this as a common utility function thatdependsonpersonalcharacteristicsaswellcommoditiesconsumed. An encompassing way of thinking about welfare is to dene it as a com- monfunctionofcapabilities\u2014theattainablefunctioningsofthatperson.Wecan writethisasfollows: Utility=U(Functionings ). It is assumed that the function Udoes not vary across people. (When using only a partial set of observed functionings in practice, this assumption need nothold).Functioningsdependinturnoncommoditiesconsumedandpersonal characteristics: Functionings =f(Commoditiesconsumed ,characteristics ). Substituting this equation into the rst we are back to a more familiar form foreconomists: Utility=u(Commoditiesconsumed ,characteristics ). Througheconomicandsocialinteractions(includingviamarkets),theattain- able functionings of a person and hence the utility derived, will depend on incomes,prices,andcharacteristics.Capabilitiesareenhancedbyhigherincome but are not solely determined by income. There will exist (in general) a money metricofcapability-dependent-welfare. Thereisacritiqueonesometimeshearsofincome-basedpovertymeasuresonthe grounds that welfare, including capabilities as an interpretation of welfare, depends on more than income. This misses the mark.9The capabilities approach points to the inadequacy of basing welfare assessments on income alone, but so too does the welfarist approach. Although measurement practices may well be decient, the use of a monetary metric does not in principle imply that only income matters. Suppose thatweagreethatwelfareisonlyaboutcapabilities.Wecanstilluseanincome-based 9For example, Iceland (2013, 47) criticizes income-poverty measures on the grounds that they \"overlookthecoreproblemassociatedwithp overty\u2014thatofcapabilitydeprivation.\"Measuring Welfare 139 measureoftheincidenceofpovertytomeasur e\"capability-poverty\"aslongascapabil- itiesdependatleastinpartonincome.10Itisreasonabletoassumethatmoreincome allowsonetodomorethings\u2014toexpandthefeasiblesetoffunctionings.Thenallwe need to do is set the poverty line such that a person at that income level will attain the critical level of capability-welfare that isneededto notbe consideredpoor bythe capabilitiesapproach.Sotheissueisnott heuseofincome-basedpovertymeasures\u2014 which can in principle be constructed to be perfectly consistent with the capabilities approach\u2014but whether the poverty lines properly reflect the cost of a given level of welfareatprevailingprices.(Wereturntotheseissuesinchapter4.) Another questionable argument onehears isthat \"capabilities\" are observable but \"utility\" is not. This too misses the point. The comparison to make is not between capabilities and utility but capabilities and consumptions, which are no harder to measure. In making comparisons of people with dierent capabilities we will some- times (possibly quite often) need to decide how we weight one functioning relative to another. That requires a utility function. By either approach, welfare depends on consumptionsandpersonalcharacteristics(box3.3).Thatisnotthenadierence. Social Effects on Welfare Yet another issue underlying dierences in how people think about welfare relates to the role played by \"social needs.\" Economists have traditionally taken the view that a person's welfare depends solely on her personal command over commodi- ties (and personal and household characteristics). There is no explicit role for social context in assessing poverty. The alternative view is that people have social needs that depend on context\u2014that poverty can stem from socialexclusion .T h i sc a ne n t a i l explicit exclusion from certain activities (such as being employed), but it typically means more than that\u2014it can also arise from relative deprivation (being poor rela- tivetoothersinthesocietyonelivesin)oraperceivedlackofopportunityforfuture progress. There has been much debate about absolute versus relative poverty. It is some- times argued that, while absolute poverty entails objective deprivation in nutrition and health, relative poverty is only \"in the mind\"\u2014a subjective, psychological state such as envy. This view has come to be seriously questioned by the evidence of bio- logical responses to relative poverty, notably through heightened stress, as indicated by cortisol levels.11For example, one study forparticipatinginsocialandeconomicactivity. The idea of relative deprivation also has relevance for how we think about welfare and measure poverty. Whether starting from a welfarist or non-welfarist position, manypeoplewouldagreethatrelativepositionoftenmatterstopeople'swelfare.The welfaristwillsay that one's personalutility islowerat given\"own-income\"whenone lives in a place where all others have a higher income than in a place where everyone hasalowerincome\u2014oneexperiencesadisutilityofrelativedeprivationintheformer case.(Thenon-welfaristwillprobablypointinsteadtoone'sdiminishedcapabilityfor participating in social and economic life in the former setting.) The weight attached to relative position can often be crucial to the conclusions one draws about poverty. box3.4illustratesthispointwithsomesimplenumericalexamples. Box3.4WhichDistributionHasMorePoverty? Considertwoincomedistributions(thinkoftheunitsasdollarsperdayorper hour): A:(1,1,1)B:(2,3,10). We can all agree B is more unequal. But everyone in B has a higher income than in A. If we think of income as the \"primary good,\" then Rawls's dierence p r i n c i p l e( c h a p t e r2 )w i l lp r e f e rBt oA ;t h ei n e q u a l i t yh a sb e n e t e dt h ep o o r . IncomepovertyislowerinB,butinequalityishigher. However, as we also saw in chapter 2, Rawls and Sen have emphasized that primary goods are not only commodities, but are broader, potentially includ- ing not being relatively deprived. Suppose instead that welfare is own income normalizedbythemean.Thenormalizeddistributionsofwelfarearethen: (1,1,1)(0.4,0.6,2 ). \"A\" now has both lower inequality and lower welfare poverty for all Welfare 141 Arguably the most important contribution of the capabilities approach was the explicitrecognitionitgavetothefactthathouseholdsvaryintheircapacitytoconvert commoditiesintowell-being.Thiswasimplicitinthemainstreamwelfaristapproach, but in practice that approach was too often simplied to the point of ignoring het- erogeneity in relevant non-incomefactors in welfare.

Opportunities The ideaof \"opportunities\" has motivated another alternative to welfarism. The idea of inequality of opportunity (INOP) has a long history. As we learned in chapter 1, the surge of attention to inequality in the latter part of the eighteenth century was far more about inequality of opportunity than of outcomes. Since then, advocates of eorts to promote equality of opportunity have been found on both the Left and Right. Roemer (1998) argues that we need only worry about inequalities that stem fromcircumstancesbeyondanindividual'scontrol\u2014thosethingsthatarenottracea- bletotheindividual'sownchoices(box1.8).Theclassicexampleofacircumstanceis parentaleducation.Supposethatthesonofwell-educatedparentsmistakenlyunder- investsinschoolingandgrowsuppoor.Anopportunitiesapproachmaydeemhimto bewellobasedonhisparents'schoolingeventhoughhisincomeislow.

Eorts are taken to be choice variables that depend on circumstances. This approach implies that the welfare metric for assess- ing inequality and poverty should be the component of income or consumption that is attributable to circumstances. This is often retrieved by regressing income on circumstances.14 There is a continuing debate on the merits of this view. People make mistakes and chance also plays a role.15The opportunities approach typically treats mistakes the same way as well-considered choices. While the ethical status of mistakes is rea- sonably clear in the opportunities approach, many observers will be willing to help those for whom past mistaken choices have caused current deprivations. It is surely unimaginable that any civilized society would do nothing about extreme, possibly life-threatening, deprivations on the grounds that they are traceable to some mis- takenchoicesbythepersonsconcernedortheirbadluck.Inequalitiesstemmingfrom choicesorluckcanhardlybebannedfrompublicredress. The INOP approach in practice rests on a regression model of income on circum- stances, which is then used to measure INOP.16It is acknowledged that income also dependsoneort,butitisarguedthatthisischosenbypeoplethemselvesandisthen a function of their circumstances. Thus, the regression of income on circumstances 14See,e.g.,Bourguignonetal.(2007),Barrosetal.(2009),andFerreiraandGignoux(2011).Also seethediscussioninRoemer(2014).Section3.3discussesthisapproachfurther. 15SeethediscussioninKanburandWagsta(2015). 16ExamplescanbefoundinBarrosetal.(2009),FerreiraandGignoux(2011),andRoemer(2014).142 measures and methods usedintheINOPliteraturecanbegivena\"reducedform\"interpretation.17However,it shouldbenotedthatthispredictedvalueisnotingeneralautility-consistentwelfarist approach,whichwouldinsteaduseasthewelfaremetricamonetaryequivalentofthe maximumutilityattainablewheneortischosenoptimally,givencircumstances.This is explained in box 3.5.

Box3.5MeasuringINOPWhenEortMatterstoW elfare Utility can be taken to be a function of income and eort, with second equation for income, then we have an equation for income as a function of circumstances.

The person's welfare is the maximum level of utility they can derive, which dependsontheircircumstancesasfollows: Utility=U[F(Eort,Circumstances ),Eort].

However, as we will see, even this less ambitious task still poses challenges for theanalyst. 3.2 Using Household Surveys for Welfare Measurement Household surveys are the single most important source of data for making poverty comparisons; indeed, they are the only data source that can tell us directly about the distribution oflivingstandardsinasociety,suchashowmanyhouseholdsdonotattain a given consumption level.

Two samples are independent if the fact of being selected for one of them has no bearing on the probability of being selected for the other. Independence in the selection of samples is assured by randomization. There are many ways of doing this, but the simplest is to assign a number to each potential sample point in the sample frame and draw a subset of those numbers randomly, using a random number generator.

Here you break the population up into well-dened subgroups (strata) and then do simple random sampling within each stratum, but at dierent rates.

Incalculatingsummarystatisticsfromthesample,onetypicallywantsagood estimateforthepopulationfromwhichthesamplewasdrawn.Thisrequiresthat one weights each observation from the sample according to how many people it represents in the population.

These weights are important data in their own right and should always be available to users for anythingbutasimplerandomsample(inwhichallsamplepointscanbeequally weighted).

Cluster sampling (also called two-stage sampling) can then help. By this method, one rst randomly samples clusters of households, such asvillagesorcityblocks;thesecanbecalledtheprimarysamplingunits(PSUs). PSUs are picked with probability proportional to their size, as usually based on the latest Census. One then samples households randomly within the selectedMeasuring Welfare 145 clusters, after doing a complete listing of the households in each sampled clus- ter.Ifclustersamplinghasbeenused,itisoftenimportanttoknowhowthiswas done;forexample,ifonlyoneclusterwaspickedineachoftheregionsthenthe regionalpovertymapmaybequitemisleading.Andoneshouldbewaryofhaving toomanystagestothesamplingsincetheprecisionofestimationforpopulation parametersmayfallconsiderably. Units within the same cluster cannot be considered to be independent, as they may well share some common attribute (such as associated with living in thesamevillage).Animportantdierencebetweenstraticationandclustering is that the former typically increases the precision of your estimates from the sample while the latter reduces that precision. The estimates of the sampling variance need to be adjusted (upward) for clustering. The extent of the adjust- ment depends on how strongly correlated the outcomes of interest are within theclusters(oftencalledthe\"intra-clustercorrelation\").Whenoneisestimating aregressionmodel(box1.19)thethingtofocusonistheintra-clustercorrelation oftheregression'serrorterm. One of the key design choices for a sample survey is how many house- holds to interview in each PSU versus how many PSUs to sample. If one wants to estimate average values for the PSUs, then one clearly needs adequate samples at the PSU level. However, for a given aggregate sample size, larger samples at the PSU level reduce precision in estimating population character- istics. The choice depends on how much variance there is within PSUs and the purposes of the surveys\u2014notably whether the study calls for estimates at the PSUlevel. Errors are expected in small samples, even when random. While you cannot expect to get it exactly right in a small sample, as the sample size increases you should be getting closer to the truth. If not, then something must be wrong in the estimation method. For example, your sample might not in fact have beendrawnrandomly,soitisnotrepresentativeofthepopulation.Whenusing a sample survey to measure poverty, a large-sample bias occurs if rich peo- p l er e f u s et op a r t i c i p a t ei nt h es u r v e y \u2014 t h e ya r ej u s tt o ob u s y ,o ra r en e v e r home, or maybe your interviewers cannot get past their guard dogs! So you overestimate the poverty rate. This type of problem is sometimes called sur- vey response bias . While sampling error arises because you do not have a large sample, this form of non-sampling error does not go away as your sample size increases. Even if everyone who is sampled randomly is available to be interviewed, measurementerror isstillaconcerninsurveys(andcensuses).Forexample,some people (probably more the rich than the poor) may be making wild guesses at key components of their income or consumption.

Thehouseholdsurveysfoundinpracticecanbeclassiedalongfourdimensions: 1.T h es a m p l ef r a m e : The survey may represent a country's population, or some more narrowly dened subset, such as residents of a region. The appropriate- ness of a survey's sample frame naturally depends on the inferences one wants todrawfromit. 2.The unit of observation: This can be the household itself or the individuals within the household or both. A \"household\" is usually dened as a group of people eating and living together. Household structures can sometimes be complex, such as in societies where polygamy is practiced or where communal living in c o m p o u n d si sc o m m o n( s u c ha si nr u r a la r e a so ft h eS a h e lr e g i o no fA f r i c a ) , making it dicult to distinguish one household from another.18Most house- hold surveys include some data on individuals within the household, though this rarely includes their consumptions, which are typically aggregated to the house- hold level; examples include India's National Sample Surveys (NSS), the World Bank's LSMS sur- veys. An example of a survey which collected individual food consumption data is the survey of rural households in the Philippines that was done by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) in the 1980s.19When there are multi-cell households (associated with dierent wives) complex surveys are required.20 3.Th en u m b e ro fo b s e rv a t i o n so v e rt i m e : A single cross-section, based on one or two interviewswithinashortperiod,isthemostcommon.Inapanel(alsocalledlon- gitudinal)surveymembersofthesamehouseholdareresurveyedoveranextended 18SeeScott(1980a),UN(1989),andRosenhouse(1990). 19SeeBouisandHaddad(1992). 20De Vreyer et al.

(2014).Measuring Welfare 147 period. Such surveys are harder to implement and more costly, but have some advantages(box3.7). 4.The principal living standard indicator collected: The most common indicators of poverty used in practice are based on household consumption expenditure or household income. Some surveys collect both (such as Indonesia's SUSENAS and the World Bank's LSMS), but others specialize (e.g., India's NSS does not include all income sources, while most of the household surveys available for Latin America do not include consumption). Not having both income by source and expenditure by type can be a serious limitation for certain purposes, includ- ing assessing the poverty impacts of changes in prices. (We return to this application.) Box3.7PanelDataandItsApplications Most surveys entail interviewing members of one household over a short period of time (a few days or possibly in just one visit). This is a single cross-sectional survey\u2014by far the most common form. By contrast, in a panel survey,twoormoreroundsofsurveydataarecollectedonthesamehousehold.

The poverty counts may even be the same in the two dates, yet that is consistent with both complete persistence (the same people are poor in both years) and complete \"churning\" (all those who were poor in the rst year escaped poverty, while all who were not poor in the rst year fell into poverty in the second).

There can also be biases due to attrition, whereby some nonrandom subsample drops out of the panel. This would be the case if attrition is due to households with a higher propensity to migrate for work. And time-varying measurement errors can be a concern; at least some of those \"o-diagonal\" elements in the arrayabove(thosewhomovedinoroutofpoverty)willbemeasurementerrors. (Forexample,ifahousehold'sincomewasunderestimatedinperiod1thismight becorrectedinperiod2.) Three well-known examples of panel data sets are the University of Michigan's Panel Study of Income Dynamics in the United States, the Village Level Surveys by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics in India, and the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Study run by the UniversityofNorthCarolinaoverthelasttwentyyears.Veryfewsurveyscollect individual consumption data on a longitudinal basis (an exception is the afore- mentioned IFPRI survey for the Philippines). A modied version of the classic panel has been used in some LSMS surveys, whereby half of each year's sample is resurveyed the following year. This cuts the cost of forming a panel data set, whileretainingsomeoftheadvantages.

It is thus possible to construct panels for some periods (ChenandRavallion1996). A second example is the study by Chetty et al. (2014) of intergenerational income mobility in the United States. Chetty et al. use income tax records to link children to their parents (who had typically led for them as dependents prior to leaving home). They nd that measures of income mobility have beenMeasuring Welfare 149 quite stable since the 1970s.

The most common survey used in poverty analysis is a single cross-section for a nationally representative sample, with the household as the unit of observation (though with some information obtained from specic individuals), and it includes eitherconsumptionorincomedata.Thefollowingarethemainproblemstobeaware of when interpreting household consumption or income data from such a household survey.21 Survey Design Even very large samples may give biased estimates for poverty measurement if the surveyisnotrandom,orifthedataextractedfromithavenotbeencorrectedforpos- sible biases, such as due to sample stratication (box 3.6). A random sample requires that each person in the population or each subgroup in a stratied sample has an equalchanceofbeingselected.Thisguarantees statisticalindependence \u2014theassump- tion that underlies most of the results used routinely in making statistical infer- ences about population parameters from sample surveys. (See box 3.6 on statistical independence.) Poor people may not be properly represented in sample surveys; for example, t h e ym a yb eh a r d e rt oi n t e r v i e wb e c a u s et h e yl i v ei nr e m o t ea r e a so ra r ei t i n - erant. Indeed, a household survey may miss one distinct subgroup of the poor: those who are homeless. Also, some of the surveys that have been used to meas- ure poverty were not designed for this purpose, in that their sample frame was not intended to span the entire population. Examples include labor force sur- veys, for which the sample frame is typically restricted to the \"economically active population,\" which precludes certain subgroups of the poor. Key questions to ask about any survey are: Does the sample frame span the entire population?

Box3.8TheEconomicsofSurveyParticipation Survey participation is a matter of individual choice; nobody is obliged to comply with the statistician's randomized assignment. There is some perceived benet from compliance\u2014the satisfaction of doing one's civic duty\u2014but there is a cost as well. That cost can be expected to rise with income. For example, the opportunity cost of the time required to comply rises with income (due to higher wage rate), while the time itself is roughly independent of income. The potential survey respondent must weigh the perceived benets against thecost.

Consumption should cover all monetary expendi-tures on goods and services consumed plus the monetary value of all consumptionfrom income in kind, such as food produced on the family farm, or hunted and gath-ered from common property resources, and the imputed rent for owner-occupiedhousing. 24Similarly, the income denition should include income received in kind 23See,e.g.,KilicandSohnesen(2014),whociteotherrelevantevidence. 24For further discussion of consumption and income denitions in household surveys, see UN (1989).Onmeasuringconsumption,alsoseeDeatonandZaidi(2002). Measuring Welfare 153 although practices vary. Local market prices often provide a good guide for valuation of own-farm production or owner-occupied housing. The valuation of noncash bene-tsfrompublicservicesisoftendicult,thoughpotentiallyimportant.Fortransfersin kind of market goods, prevailing prices are generally considered to be satisfactoryfor valuation. Non-market goods (such as free use of a public health clinic or school)present a more serious problem, and there is no widely preferred method. A separatemonitoringoftheuseofpublicservicesbypoorpeoplewillbeneeded. Acommonproblemfacingthewelfareanalystusingahouseholdsurveyisthatthe survey may not be properly integrated, in that categories do not match in relevant ways across dierent segments of the survey. For example, to evaluate the welfareeectsofachangeinfoodstaplepricesinafood-producingcountry,itisnotenoughto know the budget shares of consumption at the household level\u2014one must alsoknowhouseholdfoodproduction.Whetherahouseholdgainsorlossesfromachangeinthepriceoffooddependsonconsumptionnetofproduction;ifyouconsumemorethan you produce of some good, then you will be worse o when the price of thatgood rises. However, it is quite common that household surveys in rural areas eitherdo not include data on farm production, or they do not use the same commoditycategorization in the consumption and production schedules. This can make thosesurveys virtually useless for analyzing certain policy problems such as trade reforms.(Chapter9discussestradepoliciesfurther.) Variability and the Time Period of Measurement Ithaslongbeenrecognizedthattheexistenceofvariationovertimeinincomesand/orprices has implications for the denition and measurement of \"real income.\" Income observedoverarelativelyshortperiodoftimemaybedeceptiveabouteconomicwel-fare. John Hicks (1939, 176) dened a person's \"income\" as \"what he can consumeduring the week and still expect to be as well o at the end of the week as he was atthebeginning.\" Itissometimesarguedthatwhatwereallyneedtomeasureis\"wealth.\"Acommon economic denition is the discounted present value of all future incomes, although thisismakingsomeratherstrongassumptions(box3.10).Findingauniquedenitionof wealth that can be considered realistic and comprehensive has proved dicult inpractice.

All this is clearly making some strong assumptions including perfect fore- sight with no uncertainty. (This can be relaxed to perfect stochastic foresight, allowing for unpredictable errors\u2014sometimes called \"rational expectations.\") The method also runs into a problem when some markets are missing for some componentsofwealth. There is also a practical problem in implementing this denition: we can- notobtainfutureincomesfromahouseholdsurveytoday.However,wecanask aboutcurrentconsumption.Undercertainconditions,consumptiondependson wealth,notcurrentincome.Box3.11goesfurtherintothistopic. The existence of income variability over time is one reason some analysts prefer current consumption to current income as the indicator of economic welfare. Real incomes of the poor can vary over time in predictable ways (as well as unpredictable ones).Thisisparticularlytrueinunderdevelopedruraleconomiesdependingonrain- fed agriculture. Under certain conditions, consumption will then reveal permanent income, as given by the return to long-term wealth. This is an implication of Milton Friedman's(1957)PermanentIncomeHypothesis(box3.11). However, even when those conditions do not hold, such as when credit markets work poorly, there are often ways in which people can smooth their consumption in r e s p o n s et oc h a n g e si nt h e i ri n c o m e so rt h ep r i c e st h e yf a c e ,s u c ha sb yd r a w i n go n savingsorturningtotheirfriendsandfamily.Measuring Welfare 155 Box3.11 Inter-TemporalConsumptionChoiceandthePermanent IncomeHypothesis Consider the static consumer choiceproblem discussed 1.4 and 3.1, butnowreplace\"clothing\"by\"consumptionatdate1\"andreplace\"food\"by\"con- sumptionatdate2.\"Utilitydependsonboth,andweassumeconvexindierence curvesreflectingthescopeforsubstitution,similarlytobox3.1.

The key element of the PIH is that permanent consumption is directly proportional to permanent income: CP=kYP.Friedmanpostulatedthatthecoecient kdependsonfactorssuchas therateofinterestandpreferences. The idea that current consumption reveals wealth is attractive, but it does require some strong assumptions. In particular, it assumes that the consumer hasperfectforesightandaccesstoaperfectcreditmarket.Yetpeople(andnoless poorpeople)grapplewithuncertaintyaboutthefutureandareexposedtounin- suredrisks.Andmarketsareincomplete,meaningthatnotallincome-generating components of wealth have prices attached to them, to enable straightforward aggregation. WhilethestrongimplicationsofthePIH(suchas CP=kYP)havenotreceived much empirical support, a number of studies have found that consumption responds more to permanent income than transient income. There is normally somedegreeofconsumptionsmoothing,evenforpoorpeople. Further reading: For a good discussion of consumption in an inter-temporal context,seeDeaton(1992).(Deatonwonthe2015Nobelprizeineconomics.) This observation has two distinct implications for welfare measurement: (1) cur- rent consumption is almost certainly a better indicator than current income of the currentstandardofliving,and(2)whilecurrentconsumptionisunlikelytobeideal,it156 measures and methods isabetterindicatorof long-term well-beingthancurrentincome,asconsumptionwill revealatleastsomeinformationaboutincomesatotherdates,inthepastandfuture. While there is a strong case for preferring consumption over income in measur- ing welfare, it should not be forgotten that a number of factors can make current consumption a noisy welfare indicator. Even with ideal smoothing, consumption will still (as a rule) vary over the life cycle. Thus, two households with dierent lifetime wealth\u2014one \"young,\" the other \"old\"\u2014may happen to have the same consumption at the survey date. This may be less of a problem in traditional societies where the extendedfamilyisstillthenorm,thoughthatisrapidlychanging. There are other sources of noise in the relationship between current consumption andlong-termstandardofliving.Dierenthouseholdsmayfacedierentconstraints on their opportunities for consumption smoothing. It is generally thought that the poorarefarmoreconstrainedintheirborrowingoptionsthanthenon-poor. There is also evidence that poor people tend to be less well-insured (box 3.12). While consumption smoothing and risk-sharing arrangements clearly do exist, how well they perform from the point of view of poor people is a moot point.25The lit- erature on risk and insurance in poor rural economies suggests three stylized facts: (1) income risk is pervasive; (2) household behavior is geared in part to protecting consumptions from such risk; (3) the mechanisms of doing so are both private and social, the latter comprising various informal risk-sharing arrangements among two ormorehouseholds. Box3.12 HowW ellAretheP oorInsured?EvidencefromRuralChina Are all rural households equally vulnerable to uninsured risks?

The method avoided the problems iden- tied in past tests for risk-sharing, which were biased in favor of showing that therewasinsuranceevenwhentherewasnone. The full insurance model was convincingly rejected. The lower a household's wealth, the stronger the rejection, in that the implied marginal propensity to 25Relevant empirical work for developing countries includes Bhargava and Ravallion (1993), Townsend (1994), Ravallion and (1999), and Dercon and Krishnan(2000).Measuring Welfare 157 consumeoutofcurrentincomeishigherforpoorerhouseholds.Whilethereare clearly arrangements for consumption insurance in these villages of southern China,theyworkconsiderablylesswellfortheasset-poorhouseholds.

Advocates of using income data in preference to consumption often point to con- straints on inter-temporal choice and risk sharing. However, such constraints do not justify believing that current income is a better welfare metric than consumption.

The rst is \"item nonresponse.\" This can occur when some of the sampled households who agreetoparticipaterefusetoanswerspecicquestions,suchasoncertaincomponents of their incomes, which can be sensitive.

Suchmethodsarenotanoptionforthesecondtypeofmeasurementerror,namely \"unit nonresponse.\" Typically there is some proportion of sampled households that does not participate in a survey, either because they explicitly refuse to do so or nobody is at home (box 3.6).

These errors are of special concern in the context of measuring poverty and inequality,whichdependsonresponsestoquestionspertainingtoincomesandexpen- ditures and those questions can sometimes be sensitive. Some analysts have argued thatmisreportingofincomesinhouseholdsurveysjustiesscalinguptheincomedis- tributionsothatitsmeanequalsGDPpercapitaorPrivateConsumptionpercapitain the National Accounts System (NAS).33We can call this the uniformrescalingmethod . This method ignores the fact that what is called \"Private Consumption\" in the NAS includes components of institutional consumption, as well as personal consumption, which could introduce a systematic overstatement of household welfare levels. The mismatch in what is being measured is even worse if the scaling up is to GDP per capita itself, rather than only to per capita consumption from the NAS, since GDP includesmanythingsthatarenotattributabletocurrenthouseholdincomesorexpen- ditures.Theextentofthegapbetweenthetwodatasourcesdependsontheeconomy.

The likelihood that underreporting and selective compliance lead to an underesti- mation of \"top incomes\" in surveys has led to interest in the use of supplementary data from income tax records.37T h em e t h o d st y p i c a l l ye m p l o yP a r e t o ' sL a wf o r t - t i n gt h eu p p e rt a i l( r e c a l lb o x1 . 2 1 ) .(Th e g u r e so nt h ei n c o m es h a r e so ft h et o p1 % in the United States in gure 2.4 were estimated this way.)

Interpersonal Comparisons of Welfare Household size and demographic composition vary across households, as do prices. These factors generate dierences in well-being at given household expenditures. There are various approaches to normalize for these dierences based on demand analysis, including equivalence scales, cost-of-living indices, and equivalent income measures.38The basic idea of these methods of welfare measurement is to use demandpatternstorevealconsumerpreferencesovermarketgoods.39Theconsumer is assumed to maximize utility, and a utility metric is derived that is consistent with observed demand behavior, relating consumption to prices, incomes, household size, and demographic composition. The resulting measure of household utility will 35ThisisconsistentwiththendingsofKorineketal.(2007). 36SeeKorineketal.(2006). 37See,e.g.,Atkinson,Piketty,andSaez(2011)andPiketty(2014). 38There are a number of Deaton and Muellbauer (1980).Empiricalexamplescanbefoundin, interalia,King(1983),AppsandSavage(1989),Jorgenson andSlesnick(1989),DeBorger(1989),andRavallionandvandeWalle(1991a). 39Though there are measures based on the distance function, or \"quantity metric utility,\" which do not assume that markets exist; see Deaton and Muellbauer (1980) for discussion and references. However,dataonpreferencesarestillrequired.Measuring Welfare 163 typically vary positively with total household expenditures, and negatively with householdsizeandthepricesfaced. The most general formulation of this approach is the concept of \"equivalent income,\"denedastheminimumtotalexpenditurerequiredforaconsumertoachieve his or her actual utility level when evaluated at predetermined reference prices and demographics xed over all households.40This gives an exact monetary measure of utility; indeed, it is sometimes called money-metric utility (MMU). Quite generally, equivalent income can be thought of as money expenditures (including the value of ownproduction)normalizedbythetwo deflators:asuitablepriceindex(ifpricesvary overthedomainofthepovertycomparison)andanequivalencescale(sincehousehold sizeandcompositionvary).Thesedeflatorsarediscussedfurtherinthenextsection. Thereareanumberofconcernsthatoneshouldbeawareofinallsuchbehavioral welfare measures. A serious problem arises when access to non-market goods (envi- ronmental characteristics, public services, demographic characteristics) varies across households, as discussed in section 3.1. Consumptions of market goods only reveal preferences conditional on these non-market goods; they do not, in general, reveal unconditional preferences over both market and non-market goods. (For example, if y o ul i v ei nap l a c ew h e r et h e r ei sag o o dq u a l i t ya n df r e ep u b l i ch e a l t hc l i n i cy o u will spend less on private health care.) A revealed set of conditional preferences over market goods may be consistent with innitely many utility functions representing preferences over all goods (box 3.2). It is then a big step to assume that a particular utilityfunctionwhichcanbefoundtosupportobservedconsumptionbehaviorasan optimumisalsotheonewhichshouldbeusedinmeasuringwelfare. Household surveys of consumptions and expenditures are the most basic and widely used data for implementing consumption-based welfare indicators. A sepa- rate community survey\u2014done at the same time as the interviews, and often by the sameinterviewersintheenumerationareaschosenforthesurvey\u2014canprovideuse- fulsupplementarydataonthelocalpricesofarangeofgoodsandontheprovisionof local public services.

T he latter is in formulating antipoverty policies.Evenbeforetherewerepovertymeasuresfordescriptivepurposes,therewere attempts to dene what constitutes a reasonable minimum income level to not be considered poor in specic settings for the purposes of policy. Indeed, the basic idea ofsucha\"povertyline\"isoneoftheoldestconceptsinappliedeconomics,goingback toatleasttheeighteenthcentury,suchasintheSpeenhamlandantipovertypolicy(see chapter1). The economic interpretation of a poverty line is as the cost of attaining a given levelofeconomicwelfareor\"standardofliving\"indierentplacesordierentdates. The dependence of cost-of-living (COL) indices and equivalence scales on the choice of the xed reference standard is well understood (as we learned in chapter 3).

However, inmostsocieties,includingsomeofthepoorest,thenotionofwhatconstitutes\"pov- erty\" goes beyond the attainment of the absolute minimum needed for survival. The reference standard of living for dening the poverty line is almost never the lowest leveloflivinginsociety .

Recall from chapter 3 that there is no escapingtheneedforexternalethicaljudgmentsinmakingwelfarecomparisons.Itis entirely defensible for an external observer to judge that there is a qualitative dier- ence in welfare at one or more critical levels in a specic society. Poverty lines can be seen as normative social judgments, with no less validity than (say) one's inequality aversion. It seems that almost everyone has a concept of \"poverty,\" even if they do not see somediscontinuity.Surveysinvariablyndthatthereisauniquelevelofincomeabove which people in the specic society and time tend to think they are not \"poor\" but belowwhichtheyare. Thispointiscalledthe\"socialsubjectivepovertyline\"anditis animportantconceptthatwewillreturntoinsection4.3ofthischapter. Setting an explicit poverty line can also help focus public attention and action on the situation of poor people. As we learned in chapter 1, the various poverty lines that emerged in England, the United States, and elsewhere around the turn of the twentiethcentury(intheworkofRowntree,Booth,Hunter,andothers)helpedmany well-opeoplecomprehendjusthowlittlesomepeoplehadtoliveon,andthishelped mobilizeactiontoreducepoverty.Similarly,inmoderntimes,anyonecanfairlyreadily comprehend just how frugal the material level of living is of someone with less than $1 per day at their disposal. This sharply focuses attention on material deprivation. Evenbeforeitwasfeasibletocounthowmanypeoplewerelivingbelowsomepoverty line, setting a line was seen to be a useful step in formulating concrete antipoverty policies,suchasexempliedbytheSpeenhamlandsystemin1795. Some observers have also worried about the judgments that are required in set- ting poverty lines.1Y e ti nt h i sr e s p e c tp o v e r t yl i n e sa r en o tf u n d a m e n t a l l yd i e r e n t to many other ideas in applied economics.

The following discussion will focus on the main alternative methods of setting poverty lines found in practice. It is worth noting at the outset that a number of the methods reviewed here have in common the idea of anchoring the monetary poverty line to an explicit non-monetary indicator of welfare.

We have a welfare indicator W ifor household or person iwhich depends on (say) log household income, Yi, as well as other welfare- relevant characteristics, Xki(k=1 ,...,K).

The COL will typically vary across certain subgroups, such as large and small households, or thoselivinginurbanversusruralareas.Anywelfarecomparisons,includingpovertyor inequality measures, will clearly need to normalize measured nominal consumptions orincomesfortheseCOLdierencestoobtainrealvalues.3Thisiswidelyunderstood in applied economics. The distinctive thing about poverty measurement is that the normalization is anchored to a reference level of living that is needed to not be con- sidered \"poor\" in a specic context.

At a theoretical level, one can think of the problem of setting a welfarist poverty line as entailing two steps.

Historicalnote: One of the many contributions of John Hicks to economics was the idea of the \"utility-compensated demand function,\" found in his 1939 vol- umeValue and Capital .ThisissometimescalledtheHicksiandemandfunction. However, this does not get us very far in solving the problem of setting poverty lines, but merely translates it from one space (consumption) into another (utility). Formanyofthepurposesofmeasurement,thewelfaristframeworkdoesnotinclude a suciently well-dened notion of what poverty means. As discussed in chapter 3 (section3.1),non-welfaristapproachestodrawingpovertylinescanbeinterpretedas attempts to expand the information base used in measuring poverty to include indi- cators of capabilities\u2014the attainments of specic valued functionings, such as being adequatelynourishedtosupportnormalactivitylevels. Food-energyrequirementsfornormalactivitylevelshavebeenwidelyusedinset- ting poverty lines. Requirements vary across individuals and over time for a given individual.5Nutritionists have estimated food-energy requirements for maintaining bodyweightatrest,processingfood,andsustainingvariousactivitylevels.6 In usingthese estimates in calculating a poverty line, a normative judgment must be made about activity levels. Actual activity levels may reflect poverty. It is plausi- ble that the poorest are underweight and that their activity levels are constrained by this fact. In such a setting, incorporating existing dierences in activity levels (and, indeed, weights) into subgroup poverty lines will clearly lead to a bias in the poverty comparison, in that the poverty lines need not be clearly anchored to a reasonable conceptionofwhatwouldconstituteaxedstandardoflivingoverthedomainofthat comparison. H a v i n gs e tf o o d - e n e r g yr e q u i r e m e n t sh o wc a nw e n dam o n e t a r yp o v e r t yl i n e ?

This is the food-energyintake method. A second approach (and the main rival to the rst method in practice) nds instead a combination of foods that attains the food-energy requirements, as well as othernutritionalneeds,andcalculatesthe costofthatbundle,togiveafoodpoverty line.Thisisthenaugmentedfornon-foodneeds.Thisisthe cost-of-basicneeds (CBN) method. One approach to determining the bundle is to minimize the cost of achieving the food-energyrequirementsatgivenprices.Apotential probleminpracticeisthatthis methodcanyieldacompositionofthedietthatisalientoexistingfoodhabits,which are often well dened by traditions going back centuries.

The expert group evaluates the nutritional composition of every regional basket as wellasthecompositionofthenon-foodcomponents.

Three zones for non-food goods and three zones for services/utility baskets are dened according to climatic conditions in Russia. The basket for non-food goods provides detailed quantities for six groups. These groups are similar to those used in the construction of the food basket, except that separate baskets for non-food goods are dened for elderly men and women.

Instead of identifying a complete set of both food and non-food goods comprising the poverty bundle (as in the case of Russia), a more common approach in practice is to set a food bundle, and then add an allowance for non-food spending consistent with the spending patterns of those who have attained the food poverty line. These are sometimes called Engel curve methods .B yo n ev e r s i o no ft h i sm e t h o d ,o n e r s t estimates the cost for each subgroup of a food bundle which achieves the stipulated food-energyintakelevel,andthendividesthisbytheshareoffoodintotalexpenditure ofsomegroupofhouseholdsdeemedlikelytobepoor,suchasthepoorest20%ineach subgroup. A variation on this method is that proposed for the United States by Mollie Orshansky(1965),whichwealreadyheardaboutinchapter2(box2.5).Havingsetthe food poverty bundle to minimize the cost of attaining the predetermined nutritional needsOrshanskythendeflatedthisbytheaveragefoodshare(ofpoorandnon-poor) to derive the total poverty line. This became the basis of the ocial poverty line for the United States, which remains the ocial line at the time of writing beenheardforupdatingthemethodtobemorerelevanttocurrentstandardsofliving andconsumptionpatterns.Therehavealsobeencallstoembraceabroaderdenition ofincome,allowingforbenetsfromthegovernment.Box4.4summarizesthedebate Critics of the ocial poverty line for the United States have pointedtoanumberofconcerns.Foxetal.(2013,2)summarizetheissueswell: The ocial poverty measure (OPM) understates the extent of poverty by using thresholds that are outdated and may not adjust appropri- atelyfortheneedsofdierenttypesofindividualsandhouseholds,in particular, families with children and the elderly. At the same time, it overstates the extent of poverty, and understates the role of govern- mentpolicies,byfailingtotakeintoaccountseveralimportanttypesof governmentbenets ...whicharenotcountedincashincome.Because of these (and other failings), ocial poverty statistics do not depict an accurate picture of poverty or the role of government policies in combatingpoverty. continued200 measures and methods Box4.4(Continued) TheUSCensusBureauhasproducedanewmeasurethatattemptstoaddress these concerns; the new measure is called the supplemental poverty measure (SPM). This gives a higher overall threshold, but the income aggregate is more comprehensive, including benets received in kind (rather than cash). The net eect turns out to imply only a slightly higher overall poverty rate, which rises to16.0%in2012usingtheSPM,from15.1%usingtheOPM.Thechildpoverty rateislowerusingtheSPM,with18.0%ofchildrendeemedtoliveinpoverty,as compared to 22.3% using the OPM. However, the incidence of poverty rises for theelderly(14.8%ascomparedto9.1%)(Short2013). ThenewmeasureintroducesadegreeofrelativismintoUSpovertymeasure- ment, which has traditionally followed an absolute approach, whereby the line is only updated for inflation. The new measures were influenced by Citro and Michael (1995) who recommended that US poverty lines should be anchored to the current median of expenditures on food, clothing, and shelter. This would clearly generate poverty lines with a positive elasticity to the mean, but the elasticity will be less than unity given that these goods tend to be necessities. However, one concern with this approach is that it is unclear why concerns about relative poverty would apply only to necessities; one might expect social inclusionneedsthatgobeyondnecessitiesinacountrysuchastheUnitedStates. An important change is that the new methodology allows a seemingly straightforward accounting of the impact of public antipoverty programs. Without those programs, the poverty rate for 2012 would rise from 16.0% to 30.5%(Foxetal.2013).A14%pointreductioninthepovertyrateisattributed todirectinterventions. The new poverty numbers also suggest that the incidence of poverty in the U n i t e dS t a t e sw o u l dh a v eri s e nf a rm o r ei nt h ea b s e n c eo ft h ep u b l i cp r og r a m s . However, the claimed poverty impact of the US programs ignores behavioral responses\u2014the incentive eects that we heard about in box 1.4, and that have been much discussed back to at least the eighteenth century and continuing today. The calculations reported in Fox et al. subtract from the new income aggregatesallreceiptsfromthepublicprogramsandthenrecalculatethepoverty measures. However, while we have often heard exaggerated claims about incen- tiveeectsofantipovertyprograms(asnotedinchapter1),itishardtobelieve that they are entirely absent. There is bound to be some displacement, such as through labor supply, at least at times and in places of low unemployment for poormenandwomen. The revisions to the US poverty line are welcome, but still rather limited in capturingrelativepoverty,andmoreresearchisclearlyneededontheimpactsof publicprograms.Chapter10returnstothistopic.

Orshansky assumed a food share of one-third, so she multiplied the food poverty line by three to get the total line. Such methods do not assure that the resulting poverty lines have constant real value across the domain of the poverty comparisons being made (over space or time). Dierences in the purchasing power of the resulting lines (combining food and non-food components) can emerge sim- plybecauseofdierencesinaveragerealconsumptionorincomeacrosssubgroupsor dates; those with a higher mean will tend to have a lower food share, which will thus leadonetouseahigherpovertyline.Again,aninconsistencycanarisewherebyagiven standardoflivingisdeemedtoconstitutepovertyinoneplacebutnotanother.With nobetterinformation,itisprobablybettertouseaxedfoodshare.

And there is nothing to guarantee that those shifts will be consistent with assuring the same level of welfare is attained at the dierent povertylines. Explicitconsiderationofthenormativefunctioningsthatshouldbemetforsomeone tonotbeconsideredpoorcanalsohelpinsettingthenon-foodcomponent(recalling the discussion of the capabilities approach in chapter 3). Indeed, something like this ideaisoftenimplicitinpractice.(Although\"functioning\"arenotmentionedexplicitly, suchaconceptappearstobeimplicitintheRussianpovertylinesdescribedinbox4.3.) Conceptually, one might justify the use of a higher real poverty line in urban areas than in rural areas by an appeal to the view that the capabilities to do various thingsPoverty Lines 203 (such as participating fully in the society) should be considered in measuring living standards (and hence treated as xed in a comparison of absolute poverty). On the other hand, the commodities needed to achieve these capabilities are relative, and so varyfromplacetoplace.Toseewhatbearingthisargumentmighthaveonthesetting of poverty lines, let us assume that we are concerned with two main functionings: the rst is that of being adequately nourish ed to maintain health, while the second is that of participating fully in the society in which one lives. Both require food, to maintain a healthy weight, and to maintain the necessary activities for participating in society. This food requirement is not particularly dicult to measure, and the real foodconsumptionlevelneededtoreachitisunlikelytovarymuchbetween(say)urban andruralareas. However,thatisnottrueofthenon-foodcomponentofthepovertyline,andhere itcouldplausiblybearguedthatachievingthesameabsolutelivingstandardrequires a more generous non-food commodity bundle in urban areas. For example, achieving the same capability for participating with dignity in urban society may well require that more is spent on clothes, housing, and transport than is the case in a village. This argument would generally lead one to prefer the food-share method, where the allowanceforfoodvarieslittle,whilethatfornon-foodvariesaccordingtothetypical food share of the poor. (In the food-energy method, by contrast, even the allowance forfoodwilltendtobeagooddealhigherinurbanareas.)However,ifweextendthe list of basic capabilities somewhat, then it ceases to be clear that we would want a moregenerouspovertylineinurbanareas.Forexample,ifweincludethecapabilityof obtaining the help of a doctor when sick, then the cost of doing so may well be very much higher in rural areas, given the far lower density of doctors there. There is a good case for setting a higher consumption poverty line in a geographic area that is deprivedinaccesstopublicgoods,althoughthisisrarelydoneinpractice.9 Updating Poverty Lines over Time There are two methods found in the practice of updating poverty lines over time. In the rst, the method used in the base date is simply repeated at the next date. In the second method, the old line is updated for inflation over the period using the bestavailablepriceindex(asinAmerica'sOPMmethoddescribedinbox4.4).Forsome ofthemethodsfoundinpracticethereisonlyoneoption,suchasforthestronglyrela- tivelines.Fortheabsolutelines,wehavebeenlookingatinthissectionusingtheEngel curvemethodthechoicebetweenthesemethodscanbeimportanttotheresults.

First, CPIs are not always reliable for this pur- pose.

(Large regions of Russia have average annual temperatures well below freez- ing,whileotherregionshavemoderatenorthernEuropeanclimates.)Byimplication, poverty lines should have higher value (assessed by a quantity index) in colder cli- mates. That is what was found in the data. However, the study also found violations of revealed preference criteria that cannot be easily ascribed to the sources of needs heterogeneity invoked explicitly in setting the poverty bundles. Nor do the dier- encesacrossneedsgroupsaccordwithself-ratedperceptionsofeconomicwelfare.The researchers conclude that there are latent utility inconsistencies in Russia's ocial povertylinesandtheyspeculateontheirorigin. Box4.6ApplyingSamuelson'sTheoryofRevealedPreferences toPovertyBundles Consider,twogroups,AandB(urbanandruralareas,say),eachwithapoverty l i n e ,w h i c hi st h ec o s ti ne a c hg r o u po fb u n d l e so fg o o d ss p e c i ct oe a c hg r o u p .

If this testfails,thenwecanrejectconsistencythoughpassingthetestdoesnotassure consistency for all possible utility functions. For example, suppose again that therearejusttwogoods,foodandclothing.Four\"povertybundles\"areproposed asindicatedingureB4.6.1.UtilityconsistencyisrejectedforbundlesAandB; Method Thismethodproceedsbyrstxingafood-energyintake(FEI)cut-oincalories,and thenndingtheconsumptionexpenditureorincomelevelatwhichapersontypically attains that FEI.12This can be estimated from a regression of calorie intake against consumptionexpendituresorincome.13Inessence,oneisdeningthepovertylineas thetotalconsumptionexpenditureatwhichonecan expectapersontobeadequately nourished in the specic society under consideration. If the average level of FEI at a given consumption expenditure is strictly increasing in consumption, and the food- energy requirement is a single (xed) point, then this denition will yield a unique povertyline.Noticethatthemethodautomaticallyincludesanallowancefornon-food consumption, as long as one locates the totalconsumption expenditure at which a persontypicallyattainsthecaloricrequirement. When the aim is to measure absolute poverty using a line with constant real value, the FEI method runs into a serious problem. The relationship between FEI and consumption expenditure (or income) is unlikely to be the same across regions/sectors/dates,butwillshiftaccordingtodierencesinauence,tastes,activ- itylevels,relativeprices,publiclyprovidedgoods,orothervariables.Thisisillustrated in gure 4.1, which illustrates how the method can be used to set separate urban and rural poverty lines. The curved lines represent the mean FEI at each level of nominal\"income\"(orconsumptionperperson).Food-energyexpenditurestendtobe higher in rural areas at given income. And there is nothing in this methodology to guarantee that these dierences are the ones which would be considered relevant to povertycomparisons.Forexample,agriculturalworktendstobemorestrenuousthan most urban activities, and thus entails higher food-energy requirements to maintain bodyweight.14Ifoneusedahigherfood-energyrequirementinruralareas,onecould Greer and of this method. Other examplescanbefoundinDandekarandRath(1971)andPaul(1989).Themethodhasalsobeenused byanumberofgovernments,includingIndonesia(whichwereturnto). 13On the specication of such regressions, and the econometric problems that need to be considered,seeBouisandHaddad(1992). 14See,e.g.,theestimatesofcaloricrequirementsforvariousactivitiesgiveninWHO(1985).Poverty Lines 207 There are other reasons for the shift in the \"calorie-income\" relationship in gure4.1. The relative price of food tends to be higher in urban areas. Nominal food prices are typically higher to compensate for transport costs from rural areas. Also, manynon-foodgoodsarecheaperinurbana reas\u2014indeed,manysuchgoodsareoften not available in the countryside. Tastes appear also to change with urbanization, in favor of non-food goods. Probably most worrying is the fact that richer households will tend to buy more expensive calories; using this method of setting poverty lines will mean that one sets a higher line in richer areas\u2014it becomes more like relative linesthanabsolutelines. Asaresult,onecanendupmakinginconsistentpovertycomparisonswherebyindi- viduals, who one would deem to have the same standard of living in terms of their totalrealconsumption,arebeingtreateddierently.Indeed,comparisonsofabsolute two households, one with higher real consumption than the other. Which will be deemed \"poorer\" relative to poverty lines constructed by the FEI method? The answer is not obvious, and there can be no presumption that the poorer household will be correctly identied. To see why, let real expendi- ture of household ibeyifor which y2>y1,a n dl e t Pk i=cF i/kidenote the average price paid for a calorie, where cF iis real food expenditure by i,a n dkiis the food-energy (caloric) intake, normalized by the stipulated requirement. Then yi=PF iki+cNF iwherecNF iis real non-food spending. Assume that food spend- ing increases with total spending, and that the average price of a calorie (food expenditure divided by FEI) does also/parenleftbig Pk 2>Pk 1/parenrightbig . Then the richer person buys inginrestaurants.Furthermore(forthepurposeofthisexample),supposethat FEIs are the same for both households (k1=k2)and that both are undernour- ished,thatis,food-energyrequirementexceedsintake (ki<1).Thenthepoverty gap(thedecitfromthepovertyline,asderivedbytheFEImethod)mustalways be higher for the less poor household. To see this, note that the poverty line implied by the FEI method is Zi=PF i+cNF i(sincek=1a tt h ec a l o r i cr e q u i r e - ment). Then Zi-yi=PF i(1 -ki) which is greater for the better o household. Thus, under these conditions, the poverty line will not only be higher for the 2012c)andRavallionandBidani(1994).208 measures and methods The problems with the FEI method of setting poverty lines were identied in a study for Indonesia.15Indonesia's Central Bureau of Statistics (Biro Pusat Statistik: BPS) uses a version of this method for constructing its poverty lines. It proceeds by rst xing an FEI cut-o in calories, and then nding the consumption expenditure at which a person typically attains that FEI. One then counts the number of people withexpenditurelessthanthisamount.Thus,oneisestimatingthenumberofpeople whose total consumption expenditures would be and rural areas, with higher caloric intakes at any given consumption expenditure level in rural areas. For example, as already noted, this could simply reflect a tendency for households in more auent areas to buy more expensive calories. Dierences in relative prices (food being relatively cheaper in rural areas) and tastes may also be important. For the same reasons, the relation- ship between calorie intake and income or consumption appears also to be shifting overtime,withprogressivelylowerFEIsatanygivenrealexpenditurelevel. Thedierenceinthefood-energyandincomerelationshipbetweenurbanandrural areas of Indonesia was so large that, at any given food-energy requirement level, the urban poverty line exceeds the rural poverty line by a magnitude which is sucient tocausearankreversalintheestimatedheadcountindexofpovertybetweenthetwo sectors.17 ClearlyonewantsthepovertylinesusedtoproperlyreflectdierencesintheCOL a c r o s st h es e c t o r so rd a t e sb e i n gc o m p a r e d .H o w e v e r ,a sd i s c u s s e da b o v e ,t h ef o o d - energymethodisquiteunlikelytogeneratepovertylineswhichareconstantinterms of real consumption or income across the sectors/dates being compared given that therelationshipbetweenFEIandconsumptionorincomeisnotgoingtobethesame across sectors/dates. In fact, the poverty lines generated by this method appear to behavemorelikerelativelines;indeed,theBPSlineshavebeenfoundtohaveanelas- ticitywithrespecttothemeanthatisclosetounity.18We turn next to consider such relativelines. Relative Poverty Lines A dierence between the literatures for developing and developed countries is that absolute poverty considerations have dominated the former, while relative poverty 15SeeRavallionandBidani(1994). 16SeeRavallionandBidani(1994). 17SimilarndingswereobtainedforBangladeshbyRavallionandSen(1996)andWodon(1997). 18SeeRavallionandBidani(1994).Poverty Lines 209 has been more important in the latter.19Much of the developed country literature hastakentheviewthatpovertyisentirely\"relative.\"20Thepositiononetakesonthis issue is salient to some important development debates. In particular, as we will see in chapter 8, the extent of relativism one builds into poverty measurement matters greatlytothelong-standingpolicydebatesabouteconomicgrowthandpoverty. We have seen earlier that some of the methods used to set \"absolute lines\" are implicitly introducing relative considerations. The lines we consider now make this explicit.Themostcommonpracticeindoingsoistousesomeproportionofthearith- m e t i cm e a no rm e d i a no ft h ed i s t r i b u t i o no fc o n s u m p t i o no ri n c o m ea st h ep o v e r t y line;forexample,manystudieshaveusedapovertylinewhichissetatabout50%of thenationalmedian.21Suchpovertylinesareknownas\"strongly\"relativelines.22One should not be surprised to nd that such lines yield quite dierent poverty compar- isons to xed (absolute) lines.23For example, the ocial absolute line for the United Statesgivesapovertyrateof15%in2010whileifthelinehadbeensetat50%ofthe median,theratewouldhavebeen20%.24 Is there a compelling case for using poverty lines set at a constant proportion of the mean? Poverty measures are discussed in greater detail in chapter 5, but for now we need only note that almost all measures of poverty have the property that if one doubles(say)allincomes andthepovertylinethenthepovertymeasureisunchanged. So if the poverty line is set at a constant proportion of the mean, then the measure depends solely on the relative distribution of income. It might be argued that this is still a good measure of \"relative poverty,\" to the extent that what one is really trying to capture in this concept is the amount of inequality i nt h ed i s t r i b u t i o n .W es h o u l d , however, then ask whether or not a ranking of distributions in terms of a strongly relative measure will preserve their ranking in terms of an appropriate measure of inequality. However, as we will see in chapter 5, this is not the case in general. The detailsofthisargumentmustbemodiedsomewhatiftherelativepovertylineisset at a constant proportion of the median, rather than the mean.25The outcome will thendependonhowtheratioofthemediantothemeanchangeswithincreasesinthe mean (depending in turn on how the skewness in distribution evolves).

Again, it isunclearwhatsignicanceoneshouldattachtosuchameasure. Critics of strongly relative measures in which the poverty line is a constantpro- portion of the mean (or median) point out that if all incomes increase by the same proportionthenthemeasureofpovertywillbeunchanged.Thecriticsarguethatthis is a deceptive property. It is hard to imagine that a poor person whose income has increasedby(say)100%isnotlesspoor.Yetthatiswhatsuchmeasureswilltellus. Seemingly perverse poverty trends have been found using strongly relative mea- sures. For example, one study found that relative poverty measures for Ireland were rising despite higher absolute real incomes for most of the poor.26Another study foundthatrelativepovertymeasuresforNewZealandweredeceptiveinshowingfall- ing poverty despite lower absolute levels of living for the poor.27The UNDP (2005, 334) writes, \"It is clear that when economic conditions change rapidly, relative pov- erty measures do not always present a complete picture of the ways that economic changeaectspeople'slives.\" Starting from the position that our poverty comparisons must be absolute in the spaceofwelfare(chapter3,section3.1)providesconceptualguidanceonwhatarela- tive line in the income space would look like. We can suppose that a person's welfare depends on both their own income and their relative income, dened as the ratio of their own income to the income of the country they live in. We can call this the \"relative-income hypothesis.\" We can then see why the income poverty line needed to attain a xed level of welfare will rise with the mean; the monetary line will need to be higher to compensate for the greater relative deprivation implied by living in a richercountry.However,onlyintheextremecaseinwhichwelfaredependsonrelative incomealone\u2014andnotonownincomeatgiv enrelativeincome\u2014willwegetapoverty linethatisaconstantproportionofthemean.Aslongaspeoplecareabouttheirown income,aswellasrelativeincome,thepovertylinewillrisewithmeanincomebutnot proportionately.Box4.8explainsthisfurther.

However, this argument is also questionable. Consider the classic exampleofasocialinclusionneedfoundinAdamSmith'sdescriptionoftheroleofa linenshirtineighteenth-centuryEurope(chapter1).28Sinceasociallyacceptablelinen shirt cannot cost any less for the poorest person (let alone cost zero in the limit), it 28Inmorerecenttimes,anumberofstudieshavealsopointedtothesocialrolesplayedbyclothing, festivals, celebrations, and communal feasts; see, e.g., Rao (2001), Banerjee and Duflo (2008), and Milanovic(2008).212 measures and methods simplycannotbethattherelativelineisaconstantproportionofthemean.Theanal- ogouscommoditytoalinenshirtinmiddle-andhigh-incomecountriestodaymaywell beac e l lp h o n e,bu tt h epo in tr e ma ins :itisp la usib l et ha ti d easabou twha t\" po v e rty\" means in terms of real income change as economies develop, but it is not plausible thatthepovertylineisaconstantproportionofmeanincome. How then do poverty lines vary across countries? A survey of poverty lines across ninety-vecountries,bothdevelopingandindustrialized,revealsthattheelasticityof the poverty line with respect to mean consumption is increasing in the mean. (The results are given in box 2.5.) At the mean point of the country means the elasticity is 0.66. However, among low-income countries, the elasticity is very much lower, at aboutzero.Amongthehighlyindustrializedcountriestheelasticityisclosetounity. In short, this cross-country comparison suggests that real poverty lines tend to increase with growth, but slowly for the poorest countries. Notions of absolute poverty\u2014whereby the poverty line does not vary with overall living standards\u2014 appeartoberelevanttolowincomecountries,while\"relativepoverty\"ismorerelevant to high-income countries. Furthermore, t he proportionality assumption often made in the developed country literature appears to be quite reasonable for the advanced industrialized countries, though the measure obtained is very dicult to interpret in terms of conventional concepts of inequality and poverty. The use of a constant proportionofthemeanisalsohardtodefendconceptually(box4.8). A new concept of \"weakly relative poverty\" has emerged in recent times that contains these two extremes of absolute poverty and (strongly) relative poverty as special cases. Consistently with how national poverty lines vary across countries (as in box 2.5), the key feature of these weakly relative lines is that the elasticity of the povertylinetothemeanrisesfromzerointhepoorestcountriestounityintherich- est (though never reaching unity). Chapter 2 (section 2.1) had introduced this idea, an dbo x4.9g oesin t ogr typicalofeachcountry,givenitsaverageconsumptionlevel.

A strongly relative poverty line is set at a constant proportion of the mean, Z=k.M,w h e r ekis some constant, such as 0.5, as often used in many European studies. The measure of poverty becomes P(k,L), and depends solelyon the Lorenz curve. If all P(k,L)wouldnotchange.Andthepoverty linewouldsimplyincreasebythesameproportion.

If a proposed poverty line is widely seen as too frugal by the standards of society, then it willsurelyberejected.Norwillalinethatistoogenerousbeeasilyaccepted.Weshould not then be surprised that richer countries tend to use an implicitly higher reference welfare level for dening poverty. This point has long been recognized. For exam- ple,TiborScitovsky(1978,116)notedthat,amongdevelopedcountriesinthe1960s, richercountriestendedtohavehigherpovertylinesandheexplainedthisasfollows: \"in the advanced countries, the poverty norm has long ago ceased to reflect a physi- ological minimum necessary for survival and has become instead a 'minimum social s t a n d a r do fd e c e n c y , 't h el i f e - s t y l et h a tap a r t i c u l a rs o c i e t yc o n s i d e r st h em i n i m u m qualicationformembership.\" Scitovsky'sobservationdoesnotapplyonlytotherichcountriestoday,butinfact appliestoallexceptthepoorestcountries.Asisclearfromtheprecedingdiscussionof themainmethodsusedtosetabsolutelines,therearemanyfreeparametersthatcan bebroughtintotheanalysistoinfluencethelineobtained.Thestipulatedfood-energy requirements are similar across countries, but the food bundles that yield a given nutritional intake can vary enormously (such as in the share of calories from coarse starchy staples rather than more processed foodgrains, and the share from meat and sh).Thenon-foodcomponentsalsovary,eithe rexplicitlyorimplicitly(throughshifts inthefooddemandfunctions).Therearerelativistgradientsinboththefoodandnon- food components of the national poverty lines for developing countries, though the elasticitywithrespecttomeanconsumptionishigherforthenon-foodcomponent.29 The judgments made in setting the various parameters of a poverty line are likely toreflectprevailingnotionsofwhatpovertymeansineachcountry.Andthosenorms clearly go well beyond the \"physiological minimum necessary for survival.\" The basal metabolic rate impliesa positive lower bound to the costof nutritional requirements (for all positive food prices). The cost of the (food and non-food) goods required for social needs must also be bounded below. The poverty lines found in many poor countries are certainly frugal. Consider, for example, the average daily food bundle consumedbysomeonelivinginaneighborhoodofIndia'snationalpoverty.30Thedaily food bundle per person comprised 400 grams of coarse rice and wheat, 200 grams of vegetables, pulses, edible seeds and fruit, plus modest amounts of milk, eggs, edible oil, spices, and tea.

The same is true of individuals. One approach to settingpovertylinesexplicitlyrecognizesthatpovertylinesareinherentlysubjective judgmentspeoplemakeaboutwhatconstitutesasociallyacceptableminimumstand- ard of living in a particular society. The challenge is how to go from this observation toderiveasinglepovertyline. One approach has been based on survey responses to the following Minimum Income Question (MIQ):33\"What income level do you personally consider to be abso- lutely minimal? That is to say that with less you could not make ends meet.\" The answersfoundinsurveyresponsestendtobeanincreasingfunctionofactualincome. Thisisakeyassumptionforthisapproachtosettingpovertylines.Furthermore,the studiesthathaveincludedthisquestionhav etendedtondarelationshipasdepicted 32Vegetarians would presumably need to be compensated for the meat and sh by similarly protein-richfoodsandwouldthenpreferthisversionoftheIndonesianbundleovertheIndianbundle describedabove. 33ThisisparaphrasedfromKapteynetal.(1988).216 measures and 4.2. The point Z*in the gure can be called the social subjective poverty line (SSPL)This is an obvious candidate for a poverty line; people with income above z* tend to feel that their income is adequate, while those below Z*tend to feel that it is not. Thus the SSPL can claim to reflect the collective understandings of what con- stitutes \"poverty\" in the specic setting, rather than using a concept imposed from outsidethatsetting.Thisapproach,orvariationsonit,hasbeenappliedinanumber ofEuropeancountries.34 There are likely to be other factors besides income that influence the answers to th eMIQ .W ecanthinkofth oseansw er sasafun ctio nofin c o me Yandalistofother variables, given by the vector X(similarly to box 4.1). Then Z*will also be a function ofX. It is readily veried that any variable in Xthat shifts the curved line upward (downward) in gure 4.2 will increase (decrease) Z*.T h u sw ec a ns e e ,f o re x a m p l e , how the social subjective poverty line varies with household size, demographics, or location. Judgments are called for in deciding what variables to include in the Xvector, or at least in deciding which ones should be allowed to shift the SSPL. This is a dicult butpoorlyunderstood issue.Shouldthisincludeall the observable covariatesofsub- jective welfare, or only those things that one would deem relevant to poverty lines on a priori grounds? The problem is that there are predictors of subjective welfare that are not normally considered welfare-relevant for tasks such as setting poverty linesorformulatingantipovertypolicies.Consider,forexample,thecommonnding intheliteraturefordevelopedeconomiesthatunemploymentreducessubjectivewel- fare at a given level of income.35I fo n ei n c l u d e dt h i sv a r i a b l ei nt h ev e c t o r X,t h e n one would conclude that the unemployed should have a higher poverty line than the employed, ceteris paribus . Most other approaches to setting a poverty line would not havethisfeature,andobjectionswouldsurelyberaised;indeed,thestandardeconomic model in which utility depends on the com modities consumed and leisure predicts 34See,e.g.,Hagenaars(1987). 35Examples include Clark and Oswald (1994), Winkelmann and Winkelmann (1998), and RavallionandLokshin(2001).Poverty Lines 217 that the unemployed would be better o at given income. (They would prefer not to beunemployedbutinthismodelthatwouldonlybefortheaddedincomeandhence consumptionthatemploymentallows.)Asnotedinchapter3,thisstandardeconomic model may well be incomplete, as it misses important psychic costs of unemploy- ment.Thosewhoarguethatawelfare-consistentpovertylineshouldnotbeanyhigher for the unemployed are implicitly arguing that their concept of \"welfare\" should not allow for such psychic costs. This would surely be unacceptable to those who equate \"welfare\"withutilityorhappiness. Onecanpostulatethatonlyasubsetofthe Xvariablesthathavepredictivepower forsurveyresponsesonsubjectiveminimumincomeshouldbeusedasshiftvariables for the SSPL. Those variables that are left out of the SSPL might be set at sample average values, say. In this respect the SSPL approach shares common features with alltheotherapproachesdescribedabove,namelythatexternalvaluejudgmentsabout interpersonal comparisons of welfare are required. This is unavoidable. However, the SSPL approach does allow for non-market goods, and their weights (the missing prices) are determined by the data. Thus, the method narrows the range of choices forwhichexternalvaluejudgmentsarerequired.Ofcourse,onemuststillacceptthat subjective questions about welfare provide a suciently credible signal for making such choices, after one has statistically isolated that signal from the noise that also comeswithsuchdata. InapplyingtheMIQinmanydevelopingcountries,onewillalsondthat\"income\" i sn o taw e l l - d e n e dc o n c e p t ,p a r t i c u l a r l y( b u tn o to n l y )i nr u r a la r e a s .I ti sn o ta t all clear whether one could get sensible answers to the MIQ. In work with Menno Pradhan, I proposed a method for estimating the SSPL based on qualitative data on consumption adequacy, as given by respo nses to appropriate survey questions.36 Instead of asking respondents what the precise minimum consumption is that they need,onesimplyaskswhethertheircurrentconsumptionsareadequate.Thisprovides a multidimensional extension to the one-dimensional MIQ. The SSPL is the level of total spending above which respondents say (on average) that their expenditures are adequate for their needs. For empirical implementation, the probability that a sam- pled household will respond that its actual consumption of each type of commodity is adequate can be modeled as a nonlinear regression, called a \"probit.\" Under cer- tain technical conditions, a unique solution for the subjective poverty line can then beobtainedfromtheestimatedparametersoftheprobitregressionsforconsumption adequacy. T h e r eh a v eb e e ns o m ee s t i m a t e so fS S P L s .37Interestingly, the estimates to date suggest that the overall poverty rate based on the SSPL is roughly similar to that implied by objective poverty lines.38It may well be that the choice of parameters in 36SeePradhanandRavallion(2000). 37I focus on application to developing countries . The applications to date include Pradhan and Ravallion (2000) using data for Jamaica and Nepal; Ferrer-i-Carbonell and Van Praag (2001), for Russia;TaddesseandShimeles(2005),forEthiopia;Gustafssonetal.(2004),forurbanChina;Lokshin etal.(2006),forMadagascar;Bishopetal.(2006),forurbanChina;andCarlettoandZezza(2006),for Albania. 38AnexceptiontothisndingisreportedfortheUnitedStatesbydeVosandGarner(1991),where the SSPL is well above the prevailing (absolute) l ine,though the US line has not beenupdated in real218 measures and methods the \"objective\" absolute lines already approximated the expected SSPL in the specic context. However, the structure of the poverty prole has turned out to be dierent in some respects. While objective poverty lines for developing countries often imply thatlargerhouseholdsarepoorer,thisisnottypicallythecaseincross-sectionalstud- ies using the subjective approach, which tends to suggest greater economies of scale in consumption than normally assumed. For example, in using the economic ladder question (chapter 3) to test the welfare consistency of prevailing objective poverty linesforRussia,strikingdierenceswererevealedinthepropertiesoftheequivalence scale.39Theobjectivepovertylineshadanelasticityof0.8tohouseholdsize,whilethe subjectiveindicatorcalledinsteadforanelasticityhalfthissize.40 Subjective data have thrown new light on the debate on whether poverty is abso- luteorrelative.Onendslittlecrediblesupportfortheideaofarelativepovertyline set at a constant proportion of the current mean income. Poverty lines calibrated to subjectivewelfaretendtorisewithmeanincomebutwithanelasticitylessthanunity, suggesting that they are more like the \"weakly relative poverty lines\" as dened by RavallionandChen(2011).41 Anumberofpapershavereportedevidenceofeectsonsubjectivewelfarethatcan beinterpretedasindicativeof\"relativedeprivation,\"meaningthatself-assessedwell- being tends to fall as social comparators better o, at given \"own income.\"42 OnestudyreportsregressionsforsubjectivewelfareintheUnitedStatesthatimplya particularlystrongrelativism,wherebyownincomedoesnotmattertosubjectivewell- beingindependentlyofincomerelativetothemeanintheareaofresidence.43Thebulk of the evidence has been for relatively rich countries. The work that has been done for developing countries has been less supportive. The tests for relative deprivation eects in self-reported happiness have found rather little support for the idea and even evidence of positiveexternal eects of using data for urban China; and Rojas (2007), using data for Mexico. For a more general dis- cussion of economies of scale in consumption in developing countries, see Lanjouw and Ravallion (1995). 41Hagenaars and Van Praag (1985) estimated an elasticity of 0.51 for eight European countries. For the United States, Kilpatrick (1973) estimated an elasticity of about 0.6 for subjective poverty lines,andDeVosandGarner(1991)foundanown-incomeelasticityoftheUSsubjectivepovertyline of0.43. 42SeeOswald(1997),Frank(1997),FreyandStutzer(2002)andClarketal.(2008).Reviewingthe evidence, Frey and Stutzer assert that \"there is lit tle doubt that people compare themselves to other peopleanddonotuseabsolutejudgments\"(2002,412).Thiswouldseemtobeoverstated. 43SeeLuttmer(2005). 44SeeSenik(2004),KingdonandKnight(2007),andRavallionandLokshin(2010)usingdatafor Russia,SouthAfrica,andMalawi,respectively.5 Poverty and Inequality Measures TorecapthestorysofarinPartTwo:Wehavelearnedabouthow\"economicwelfare\" is measured. Household command over commodities is key, although it is unlikely to be sucient information. In calibrating welfare metrics and setting poverty lines, economists have turned to two main sources of that extra information. The rst source is data on attainments of certain basic functionings, such as being adequately nourished for good health and normal activit ies. The second is information on self- assessments of welfare, for estimating social subjective poverty lines. While there is boundtobesomearbitrarinesstoanypovertyline(asthereisinotheraspectsofeco- nomicandsocialmeasurement),followingBowleyandothers,monitoringprogressin reducingthenumberofpeoplelivingbelowsomexedlineisajustiableapproachto measuringsocialprogress. Applying the various tools reviewed in chapters 3 and 4, we end up with a dis- tribution of the measures of individual economic welfare in the relevant population.

The latterhasprovedtobemorecontentious,anditisworthreviewingtheissues.Sothe chapterbeginswithadiscussionofthevariousnormativefoundationsthathavebeen proposedformeasurement,linkingbacktothediscussioninPartOne.Thiswillmake clear that in thinking about measuring poverty it makes sense to start with a discus- sion of how we measure inequality. The chapter then discusses the main measures of poverty found in practice. The chapter also reviews the various tools of analy- sis that have been developed. These include decompositions that can be done of an aggregate poverty measure and tests for assessing the robustness of ordinal pov- erty comparisons\u2014when we only need to know whether there is greater poverty in one place or at one date than another, or with and without a policy change\u2014to the assumptionsmadeaboutpovertylinesandmeasures.Oneimportantlessonfromthat discussion will be the importance of considering a range of poverty lines. This leads naturallytoadiscussionofthesizeofthe\"middleclass,\"takenuplaterinthechapter. Measures of poverty and inequality are hardly far removed from policymaking, but 219220 measures and methods there are measures that have been developed in the literature that are \"hard wired\" to assessing the performance of specic policies. A prominent example is the set of measuresof\"targetingperformance,\"whicharereviewedlaterinthischapter.

This still penalizes income inequality, assuming dimin- ishing marginal utility of income (box 1.13). In fact, we can quite generally think of ameasureofincomeinequalityasthelossofaggregatesocialwelfareassociatedwith thatinequality. Forexpositorypurposes,considerthefollowinghighlystylizedcase.Everyonehas the same utility function, which depends solely on each person's own real income. To sharpen the analysis further, suppose that this common utility function is simply the log of income. Suppose also that we can attain any distribution of a xed total income we like by transfers. (This ignores incentive eects, which we heard about in PartOneandwewillreturntoinPartThree.)Sinceeveryoneistakentohavethesame utility function, the utilitarian social welfare objective is simplied) for how we should go about measuring inequal- ity in practice. In a similar fashion, an important paper by Anthony Atkinson (1970) showedhowonecanderiveabroadclassofnormativelygroundedinequalitymeasures foramoregeneralutilityfunctionforwhichthelogofincomeisaspecialcase. O n eo b j e c t i o nt h a tc a nb er a i s e di st h a tl o w e rl e v e l so fw e l f a r es h o u l dg e th i g h e r w e i g h t ;w ed on o tj u s tc a r ea b o u ti n c o m ei n e q u a l i t yi ns o c i e t y ,w ea l s oc a r ea b o u t inequality of individual welfare levels. Another way of thinking about this is that we want our measure of inequality to reflect our ethical aversion to poverty. But how should we incorporate an aversion to inequality of welfare? The literature has not helped much in addressing this question. In principle one way of answering the question is to postulate a generalized version of the utilitarian schema. Instead of insistingthatsocialwelfareequallyweightsindividualwelfarelevels,wecanpostulate 1There are also useful guidebooks on using standard software programs; see Duclos and Araar (2006) (using DAD), Haughton and Khandker (2009) (using Stata), and Foster et al. (2013) (using ADePT).Poverty and Inequality Measures 221 asocial welfare function (SWF) that puts decreasing weight on higher levels. (We will giveanexampleinthenextsection.) Followingthisapproach,ifweinsistonthestrongformoftheParetoprinciple(as discussed in chapter 1), then we would demand that all weights are positive. But one can relax this to allow a weaker requirement that all weights are non-negative. This allows the possibility that the weight goes to zero above some point\u2014that there is some level of individual welfare above which we put negligible social value to further gains.Apovertymeasurecanbegivenanormativeinterpretationalongtheselines.2 Alternatively,wecanfollowRawls's(1971)(non-utilitarian)proposalthatourprin- ciples of justice should focus rst on the poorest stratum and (consistently with the prioritygiventoliberty)weshouldmakesocialchoicesthatdomosttor aisethewel- fareofthoseinthatstratum.Thisisthe\"maximin\"SWF(box2.3).Apovertymeasure issometimesthoughtofasawayofimplementingthisnormativeapproach.However, therearetwoqualications.First,aconventionalpovertymeasuredoesnotattachany e x p l i c i tw e i gh tt ot h et y p i c a lw e l f a r el e v e lo ft h ep o o r e s ta n dm a ye v e nb eu n a e c t e d bychangesinthatlevel.Second,noticethatRawlsclearlyhasinmindarelativemeas- ure,inthatitisspecictothecontext.Theideaisnotthatwestopassoonaseveryone isabovesome(possiblyquiteaustere)povertyline.Rather,oncethatpointisreached, wethenmoveontoconsiderthenextmostdisadvantagedgroup.Ateachstep,westill needtoidentifythemostdisadvantaged. Yet a further ethical motivation for poverty measures can be devised by consider- ing inequality of opportunity. We can think of this as combining concerns for equity and eciency. There is an equity motivation in reducing inequality of opportunity in society\u2014to assure a more level playing eld. But it comes with an eciency con- sideration, namely that we do not want to reduce inequality by bringing everyone d o w nt ot h el e v e lo ft h ep o o r e s tp e r s o n .T h u s ,w ea r ed r a w na g a i nt o w a r ds o m e form of \"maximin\"\u2014a view that policy should maximize the welfare of the most disadvantagedgroupinsociety.3 5.2 Measuring Inequality Most people have a reasonably clear idea about the dierence between \"poverty\" and \"inequality.\" As these terms are normally dened, poverty is about absolute levels of living\u2014how many people cannot aord certain pre-determined consumption needs. \"Poverty\" can be said to exist in a given society when one or more persons do not attain a level of economic well-being deemed to constitute a reasonable minimum by the standards of that society. Inequality is about the disparities in levels of living ;f o r example,howmuchmoreisheldbyrichpeoplethanpoorpeople.Thissectionreviews thestrengthsandweaknessesofsomecommonmeasuresofinequality. In applied work, economists typically measure inequality by looking at the ratios of individual incomes to the overall mean. By this approach, the measure of inequal- ity is unchanged if all incomes increase at the same proportionate rate. (As noted in 2Onthisapproach,seeRavallion(1994a). the mean real income, \u00afy.

Essentially this says that it does not matter who has which income level. TherePoverty and Inequality Measures 225 are no names attached to the incomes in the lists above.

For example, the following distribu- tionhasthesameinequalityasA: E:(0,10,10,10,10,0,10,10,10,10 ).

Then group A1 has high inequality (the maximum income dierence), while A2 has no inequality. Intuitively, the amount of inequality between the two groups (comparing the dierence in their means) is somewhere between the amountsofinequalitywithineachgroup. An objection to decomposability is that in this set up, group memberships only have salience via the incomes of those in the groups. The groups have no specialidentity.However,itappearstobethecaseattimesthatgroupidentities (suchasbyraceorgender)mattermoreth anthisdecompositionwouldsuggest. Claims that group identities do not matter to inequality because the between group component of an inequality decomposition is small may not t well with perceptionsontheground.

Thus, its evolution over time will depend on growth rates in poor countries relative to rich ones (roughly speaking), as well as the things happening within countries\u2014 economic changes and policies\u2014that aect inequality. However, if we are comparing country performance at regional or global levels then, we will want to isolate the within-country component of inequality. While there are many inequality measures and one can always calculate the average inequality index for a group of countries, only for a subset of inequality measures will that average accord with the within- country component of total inequality\u2014implying a clean separation of the part we are interested in from the total inequality. Such an exact decomposition is known to be impossible for the popular Gini index (boxes 5.1 index has long been the most popular measure of inequality, but it isnotthebestbysomecriteria.ConsiderinsteadtheMLD.Foradistributionof consumption or income y1,y2,...,yn(all elements of which are is exactly decomposable by population subgroups.

Bourguignon (1979) shows that (under mild restrictions on the properties of the inequality index) MLD is the only measure satisfying the transferaxiomthatisdecomposablewithpopulationweights.

The MLD is more appealing in this respect as it is the inequality measure corresponding to the utilitarian SWF when utility is log income (box 5.5). However, we can also object to the equal weighting of welfare levels in the utilitarian objectiveonthegroundsthatthisdoesnotadequatelyreflectouraversiontopoverty (section5.1).Thiscanbedealtwithbyahybridmeasure,combiningGini-typeweights with declining marginal utility.

Thus, it does not incorporate the utilitarian idea of diminishing This is the SWF implicit in using the MLD as the measure of inequality. On the right-hand side, we have the log of the mean, which is the maximum of the mean utility when a xed total income is redistributed, less MLD.Thus,wecaninterpretMLDasthelossofsocialwelfareduetoinequality, assumingthatincomescanberedistributedwithoutalteringtotalincome.(This veriestheclaimmadeinsection5.1.) A more general utility function is proposed in Atkinson (1970), taking the formy1-/(1 -)f o r/negationslash=1a n dl n yfor= 1. A higher value of the parameter implies that a greater penalty is attached to income inequality. This generates thecorrespondingclassofAtkinsoninequalitymeasures. While MLD (and the more general Atkinson function) incorporates dimin- ishing marginal utility of income, it weights utilities equally. A simple way of responding to this concern is to adopt the Gini-type SWF with rank-weights (box 5.2) while maintaining the assumption that utility is log income i=1i=n(n+1) 2.)Onedrawbackisthatthismodiedindexlosestheneat decomposabilitypropertyofMLD(box5.4). Another possible candidate for a measure of \"inequality\" is the strongly relative povertymeasure,inwhichthepovertylineissetataconstantproportionofthemean (as discussed in chapter 4). This makes our aversion to poverty very clear. However, one should be careful as this measure does not respect the transfer axiom. One can construct examples whereby distribution A Lorenz dominates B\u2014so that A has less inequality than B for any well-behaved measure of inequality\u2014and yet the strongly relativemeasureishigherfortheAdistribution.7Thestronglyrelativepovertymeas- ure could indicate higher poverty in A than B, even though inequality and absolute poverty are unambiguously lower in A than B. And such examples are also possible when the transfers are only made among the poor. Thus, the strongly relative pov- erty measure is not only independent of the mean, it need not be consistent with reasonablenormativejudgmentsaboutrelativepoverty. So far in this section, we have only discussed relative inequality, whereby if all incomes are multiplied by a constant the measure is unchanged. By this approach, inequality depends on the ratios of incomes in the population. \"Absolute inequal- ity\" depends insteadon the absolutedierences in levels of living, rather than relative dierences, as captured by the ratios to the mean. Standard practice is to meas- ure inequality using a relative measure, consistently with the scale invariance axiom (box 5.3). However, one can equally well me asure inequality in terms of the absolute dierences, not normalized by the mean.8To understand this distinction, consider an economy with just two household incom es: $1,000 and $10,000. If both incomes double in size then relative inequality will remain the same; the richer household is still 10 times richer. But the absolute dierence in their incomes has doubled, from $9,000to$18,000.Relativeinequalityisunchangedbutabsoluteinequalityhasrisen sharply. The choice between absolute and relative inequality measures comes down to whetheroneacceptsthescaleinvarianceaxiomforinequalitymeasurement(box5.3). Recall that this says that multiplying all incomes by a constant leaves the measure of inequality unchanged. However, it should not be forgotten that this is an axiom. We do not have to accept it. You can prefer to say that addingan equal amount to all incomesdoesnotchangeinequality.(Thisissometimescalledtranslationinvariance.) Ifonekeepsthemeanconstant(atsomereferencevalue,suchasthebaseyear)when 7This is shown in Ravallion (1994b) by exploiting analytic properties of the Lorenz curve (followingGastwirth1971). 8Inoneoftheearliestpapersonmeasuringinequ ality,Dalton(1920)discussedbothabsoluteand relative measures. Kolm (1976) noted the distinction ( as discussed later). But the distinction largely vanishedfromthesubsequentliteratureuntilitre-emergedinthecontextoftheglobalizationdebate (Ravallion2003a,2004).230 measures and methods calculating the Gini indices over time, then it becomes an absolute Gini index, as distinctfromtherelativeindexinbox5.2. Thisisnomereacademicdebate.Perceptionsonthegroundthat\"inequalityisris- ing\" appear often to be referring to an absolute concept of inequality, as reflected in commonly heard statements such as \"the rising gap between the rich and the poor.\" And the distinction matters to how one views distributional policies. Serge Kolm (1976) gives the following example. May 1968 saw mass protests by students and workersinFrance,whicheventuallyledtotheGrenelleagreementfora13%increase in all salaries. However, many of the protesters felt cheated, for in their view this agreementwouldincreaseincomeinequality.9Aswewilldiscussfurtherinchapter8, whetheronethinksaboutinequalityasabso luteorrelativemattersgreatlytothelong- standingpolicydebatesaboutthedistributionofthegainsfromeconomicgrowth.

A concern raised about this axiom is that it assumes that we know withcertaintywhoispoorandwhoisnot. Anotherpropertythatisconsidereddesirableiscalledthe monotonicityaxiom . This says that, holding all else constant, the measure of poverty must rise if a poor personexperiencesa drop inher income.This isappealing, but (aswewill see) it is not satised by the most common measure of poverty. An extension of the last axiom is called subgroup monotonicity . This says that if we partition the population into two groups, each with a xed size, and poverty increases in onegroupwhileremainingunchangedintheotherthenaggregatepovertymust rise.Thisalsoseemsreasonable;itwouldcertainlybeoddtondthataftersuc- cessfully reducing poverty in (say) rural areas, without any loss to poor people inurbanareas,andnochangeintheurban-ruralcompositionofthepopulation, that poverty in the country as a whole has risen. Subgroup monotonicity is sat- isedforall additivemeasures ,meaningthataggregatepovertyisthearithmetic sumoftheindividuallevelsofpovertyinthepopulation. A number of other axioms have been proposed that are similar to inequality measurement(seethediscussioninbox5.3).Inthecontextofpovertymeasures, scaleinvariance means that the measure is unchanged when all incomes andthe p o v e r t yl i n ei n c r e a s eb yt h es a m ep r o p o r t i o n .( T h em e a s u r ei st h e ns a i dt ob e homogeneous of degree zero.) Replication invariance requires that the measure is unchanged when we replicate the current population, or pool identical pop- ulations. The transfer axiom for poverty measures says that the measure falls whenever a given sum of money is transferred from a poor person to someone whoisevenpoorer(withoutchangingtheirranking). Noteontheliterature: Insomeoftheliterature,measuresthatsatisfyscaleinvar- iance are referred to as \"relative poverty measures,\" as distinct from \"absolute poverty measures,\" which satisfy instead a translation invariance property, in that they are invariant to adding the same absolute amount to all incomes and the poverty line. This is essentially the same distinction we heard about with regardtoinequalitymeasures(section5.2).Ishallnotusethisterminologyhere asthereisariskofconfusionwiththedistinctionbetweenabsoluteandrelative povertylines(chapter4).

Box 5.8 discusses various ways of dening PG, to help understand its properties. Ad r a w b a c ko ft h e PGis that it may not convincingly capture dierences in the severityof poverty among the poor. For example, consider two distributions of con- sumption for four persons; the A distribution is (1,2,3,4) and the B is (2,2,2,4). For a poverty line Z=3( s ot h a t H=0 . 7 5i nb o t hc a s e s ) ,Aa n dBh a v et h es a m ev a l u eo f PG= 0.25. However, the poorest person in A has only half the consumption of the poorestinB.OnecanthinkofBasbeinggeneratedfromAbyatransferfromtheleastPoverty and Inequality Measures 235 poor person to the poorest. The poverty gap will be unaected. In other words, this measuredoesnotsatisfythetransferaxiom. There are a number of poverty measures in the literature that penalize inequal- ity among the poor and so satisfy the transfer axiom (box 5.6).15In applied work the b u l ko fa t t e n t i o nh a sf o c u s e do na d d i t i v em e a s u r e s ,m e a n i n gt h a ta gg r e g a t ep o v e rt y isequaltothepopulation-weightedsumofpovertylevelsinthevarioussubgroupsof society. There are conceptual and practical advantages to such additivity in the con- struction of poverty proles and in testing hypotheses about poverty comparisons; thediscussionwillreturntosomeoftheseissues. The earliest additive measure that penalizes inequality among the poor was pro- posedbyWatts(1968).Thisisthemeanproportionatepovertygap(logoftheratioof poverty line to income), counting the non-poor as having no gap. (Box 5.9 describes the Watts index in more detail.) This index has many desirable features, although it has not been used much and was little known until the mid-1990s.16Themeasureis especiallyattractivewhenwecometodiscusstheincidenceofthebenetsofeconomic growthlaterinthischapterandinchapter8. The Watts index is a member of a large class of additive distribution-sensitive measures.17A recent example is the squared poverty gap ( SPG)i n t r o d u c e db yJ a m e s Foster, Joel Greer, and Erik Thorbecke (1984). This is similar to PGwith the (impor- tant)dierencethattheindividualproportionatepovertygapsareweightedbythose gaps, giving the squared proportionate gap.18A proportionate poverty gap of (say) 10% of the poverty line is given a weight of 10% while one of 50% is given a weight o f5 0 %( n o t i c et h a t ,i nt h ec a s eo f PG, they are weighted equally). Again we take the meanofthesesquaredproportionategapsacrossthepopulation(countingthegapas zeroforthenon-poor). Box5.9TheWattsIndex:AnOldMeasureNobodyPaidMuchAttentionto TurnsOuttoBetheBest! The Watts index was the rst poverty measure to penalize inequality among the poor, and it is arguably the best. The indexsatises all the desirable axioms for a poverty measure described in box 5.6, plus other properties that have had advocatesintheliterature.WecandenetheWattsproportionatepovertygapof continued 15One of the earliest such measures that attempted to do this was proposed by Sen (1976a, 1981a).However,thisdidnotsatisfythetransferaxiom,aswaspointedoutbyThon(1979),although Shorrocks(1995)showedthatasimplere-normalizationoftheSenindexdidsatisfythetransferaxiom and also assured continuity (so there was no jum p in the index when someone crossed the poverty line). 16Zheng (1993) rediscovered the Watts index and demonstrated its desirable properties in more formalterms. 17AscharacterizedinformaltermsbyAtkinson(1987). 18That is in fact how the authors came up with the index (based on communication with Erik Thorbecke).236 measures and methods Box5.9(Continued) personiasln(Z/Yi)ifthepersonispoor (Yi<Z);ifthepersonisnotpoor ,then the gap is zero, of course.

Now take the mean of these proportionate poverty gaps in the population. If incomes are ordered such that YiZif an only if i<q, then the Wattsindexis: W=1 nq/summationdisplay i=1ln(Z/Yi).

Noteontheliterature: TheWattsindexdidnotstarttobeacknowledgedinthelit- eratureonthetheoryofpovertymeasurementforabouttwenty-veyearsafter Watts's (1968) paper. Zheng (1993) drew attention to the many desirable fea- tures of the index. It also became important in the later literature on \"pro-poor growth,\"whichwereturntoinsection5.6. Onedrawbackofthedistribution-sensitivemeasuresisthattheyarenotaseasyto interpret as PGor (especially) H.19For poverty comparisons, however, the key point is that a ranking of dates, places, or policies in terms of SPGshould reflect well their ranking in terms of the severity of poverty. It is the ability of the measure to order distributions in a better way than the alternatives that makes it useful, rather than theprecisenumbersobtained. On comparing the above formulae for H,PG,a n dSPG,ac o m m o ns t ru ct u r ei sevi - dent.

One can say that the index is \"strictly convex\" in incomes (\"weakly convex\" for = 1). In the limit, as goes to innitytheindexbecomesthelowestlevelofincomeobservedinthedata.

Figure 5.1 also illustrates another conceptual attraction of SPG, namely, that the individual poverty measure hits zero smoothly at the poverty line; thus there is negligible dierence in the weight the measure attaches to someone justabovethepovertylineversussomeonejustbelowit.21Giventheaforementioned concerns about introducing discontinuities in the individual poverty measure and the uncertainties in measuring living standards discussed above, this is a desirable property.22 Does it really matter which of these measures one uses? Intuitively, the answer depends on whether, and how, relative inequalities in the society have changed. If all consumption levels (poor and non-poor) have changed by the same proportion\u2014 sometimes called a \"distribution neutral\" growth or contraction\u2014then all of these povertymeasureswillyieldthesamerankinginthepovertycomparison,andtherank- ing in terms of absolute poverty will depend solely on the direction of change in the meanofthedistribution. However, the dierences between these measures can become quite pronounced otherwise. Consider, for example, two policies: Policy Aentails a small redistribution frompeoplearoundthemodeofthedistribution,whichisalsowherethepovertyline happens to be located, tothe poorest households. (This is actually a fair character- ization of how a reduction in the prices of domestically produced food staples would aectthedistributionofwelfareinsomeAsiancountries.) PolicyBentailstheopposite 21Thisrelatestoalong-standingissueofwhetherp overtyisbestviewedasadiscreteorcontinuous phenomenon. For further discussion, see Atkinson (1987). This measurement issue has been found to be important in the context of analyzing the eects of risk on poverty (Ravallion, 1988a) and in characterizingoptimalpovertyreductionschemes(BourguignonandFields1990;Ravallion1991b). 22It is not shared by some other distributionally sensitive poverty measures, including Sen (1976a).238 measures and methods c h a n g e \u2014 t h ep o o r e s tl o s e ,w h i l et h o s ea tt h em o d eg a i n .( A ni n c r e a s ei nf o o ds t a p l e prices in the above example.)

There is another concern about the standard poverty measures discussed above.

That is not ethically acceptable. Given this problem, we need supplementary measures on mortality,incasethisiswhyweareseeingfallingpovertymeasures. The standard measures of poverty can also be modied to better reflect our judgments on this matter. Ravi Kanbur and Diganta Mukerjee (2007) propose an intriguing solution based on the idea of a normative lifetime, L ,s u c ht h a tp o v e r t yi s measuredusingthetimeproleofincomesforallthoseborn Lyearsago,whetherthey are still alive today. An income must be imputed for the years not living; a seemingly natural assumption to make is that all those now dead have a lower imputed income than when they were alive.

The classical economists identied the consumption floor as the point at which the populationisconstant;anytemporaryincrease(decrease)inconsumptioninaneigh- borhoodofthefloorwouldinducepopulation growth(contraction).Theideaofafloor hasbeenakeyfeatureofdevelopmentmodelsfordualisticeconomies,suchasinthe original model of Lewis (1954), which we return to in chapter 8. The idea of a con- sumption floor has often been built into demand models, famously in Engel's Law ( b o x1 . 1 6 ) .I th a ss o m e t i m e sb e e ni n c o r p o r a t e di nm o d e r ne c o n o m i cm o d e l so ft h e growthprocess,whichwealsoreturntoinchapter8.24Andtheideaofaconsumption floor is found in discussions of the problem of determining the optimal population size.25When living close to the consumption floor, the prospects for investment and sustainedgrowthwillnaturallybelimited. Thisisquiteadierentconcepttoapovertyline,whichisnottypicallyintendedto be a biological floor, in the sense that nobody lives below that level for any sustained period of time. Naturally, any poverty line aims instead to reflect what \"poverty\" means in a specic society, on the understanding that (potentially many) people live belowthatlevel.Thepovertylineisinvariablyabovethebiologicalfloor. Indeed, the idea that we should judge progress in part at least by success in rais- ingthefloorismissingfromvirtuallyallstandardpovertymeasures.Raisingthefloor automatically reduces, ceterisparibus , any measure of poverty satisfying the monoto- nicityaxiom(box5.6).However,noneofthestandardaxiomsofpovertymeasurement attach any explicit value to the level of th efl o o r .Th i sa p p e a r st ob ed u ei nl a r g ep a rt tothedicultiesinidentifyingthefloor.26 Nor does the fact that an overall poverty measure is falling tell us that the poor- est are doing better\u2014that society's consumption floor is rising. The floor may stay put,eventhoughfewerpeoplelivingatornearit.Thisisillustratedingure5.3.The decline in the poverty rate is similar but in panel (a) the level of living of the poorest isunchanged. As we saw in chapter 2, an important school of modern political philosophy has argued that we should judge a society's progress by its ability to enhance the welfare of the poorest, following the principlesof justiceproposed byRawls (1971).This has been proposed as a principle for judging development success. For example, in what cametobeknownashis\"talisman,\"MahatmaGandhi(1958,65)wrotethat\"recallthe faceofthepoorestandweakestpersonyouhaveseenandaskifthestepyoucontem- plateisgoingtobeanyusetothem.\"Watkins(2013,1)refersexplicitlytotheGandhi's talisman and argues that \"as a guide to international cooperation on development, that'stoughtotop.\" Quantifying the consumption floor is not easy, however. With a sound sampling designandlargeenoughsample,wecanbecondentaboutanestimateoftheoverall mean, but it is far from clear how reliably we could estimate the consumption floor. 24See,e.g.,Azariadis(1996),Ben-David(1998),andKraayandRaddatz(2007). 25SeeDasgupta(1993,ch.13). 26See,e.g.,Freiman's(2012)commentsonRawls'smaximinprinciple.240 measures and methods (a) Poorest left behind (b) Same reduction in the incidence of poverty but with leaving the poorest behindMeasure of welfare Cumulative % of population Measure of welfare Cumulative % of population Poverty line Poverty line Figure5.3 SameReductioninthePovertyCountbutDierentImplicationsforthe Poorest. If we were to know the true consumption and any other relevant aspects of wel- fare, we could estimate the floor directly from a suciently large sample. However, we must recognize the existence of measurement errors (chapter 3). There are also likely to be transient eects in the data, whereby observed consumption in a sur- vey falls temporarily below the floor (such as due to illness), but recovers soon after the survey is done. Given the measurement errors, there is a non-negligible chance that anyone within some stratum of low observed consumption levels is in fact at thefloor. We can postulate a probability that a person with a given observed consumption is in fact living at the floor. These probabilities are not data, of course. But there are somedefensibleassumptionswecanmakeinlieuofthemissingdata.Itisreasonable to assume that the probability of being the poorest person is highest for the person whoappearstobeworstoinourdata.Itisalsoreasonabletoassumethattheprob- abilitydeclinesastheperson'sobservedmeasureofwelfarerises.Beyondsomepoint therecanbenochancethatpersonistheworsto.Box5.10explainsthisideainmore detailandproposesaspecicfunctionalform,basedonamemberoftheclassofBeta distributions in statistics, which establishes a useful link with FGT class of poverty measures.

This may well lead one to underestimate poverty among persons, and the magnitude need not be negligible.28However, it is not clear what would be a better assumption. Further researchusingindividualconsumptiondata,whenavailable,maybeabletothrowlight onbestpracticewhensuchdataarenotavailable. Sometimesinpracticeoneonlyhasgroupeddata,suchasincomesharesofhouse- holdsrankedindeciles,orincomefrequencydistributions.(Andevenhousehold-level data can be interpreted as grouped individual data.) Poverty lines rarely occur at the boundaries of the grouped data. So we must nd some way of interpolating between thoseboundaries.Linearinterpolationistheeasiestmethod,butitcanbequiteinac- curate, particularly when the poverty line is far from the mode of the distribution (such as when it is found in the typically quite nonlinear lower region of the CDF.29) Quadratic interpolation is usually feasible with the same data, and is generally more accurate, though one must be wary of the possibility that the probability density (slope of the frequency distribution) imp lied by this method does not become nega- tive.Anothermethodofinterpolationwhichcanbeveryaccurate,andisalsousefulin certainpolicysimulations,involvesestimationofaparameterizedLorenzcurve.This is a precise mathematical model of the Lorenz curve, and a number of specications have been proposed in the literature. The accuracy depends greatly on the particular specicationused,andsometendtodominateothersonmanydatasets.30 example, I have come across one estimate of the headcount index for a country (which can remainunnamed)thatwasobtainedbylinearinterpo lationinthelowestclassintervalofthegrouped distribution;theestimatewas9.5%.However,whenonere-estimatedwithamodeloftheLorenzcurve (basedonaBetaspecication;seebelow)thattookaccountofthenonlinearity,oneobtainedagure of 0.5%! This is an extreme case, though large errors are likely from linear interpolation at the lower endofanygroupeddistribution. 30Two specications that have been found to work well in practice are the generalized quad- raticmodelandtheBetamodel;seeVillasenorandArnold(1989)andKakwani(1980a),respectively. Formulae for poverty measures as functions of the Lorenz curve parameters and the mean of the distributionarefoundinDattandRavallion(1992). 31ThekeyresultfromstatisticsbeingusedhereiscalledtheCentralLimitTheorem.Letasample meanMofanyvariablebecalculatedfromarandomsampleofsizeNandlet denotethetruevalue244 measures and methods Fortheheadcountindex,thestandarderrorcanbecalculatedthesamewayasfor any population can be extended gap indices\u2014are sure to remainpopularifonlybecausetheyaremucheasiertointerpret.Asarule,thehead- count index also tends to be less sensitive to some common forms of measurement error at the bottom of the observed distribution. It is important to know whether a povertycomparisonissensitivetothechoiceofpovertymeasure,andnotjustbecause of the uncertainties involved in that choice; dierences in rankings by dierent mea- sures can also tell us something about the precise way in which the distribution of living standards has changed. Section 5.5 will describe some analytical tools that can helpassesssensitivitytothechoiceofpovertymeasure. 5.4 Decompositions of Poverty Measures Decompositions can be useful tools in poverty analysis. The discussion here will rst discuss how a single aggregate poverty number can be decomposed to form a pov- erty prole. It will then look at two useful ways of decomposing changes in poverty overtime. Poverty Proles A \"poverty prole\" is simply a special case of a poverty comparison, showing how p o v e r t yv a r i e sa c r o s ss u b g r o u p so fs o c i e t y ,s u c ha sr e g i o no fr e s i d e n c eo rs e c t o r ofthemean.Thenitcanbeshownthat(M- )Napproachesanormaldistributionwithmeanzeroas Nincreases. 32Like any population share, Hhas a binomial distribution in random samples, approaching a normal distribution as sample size increases. Thus the standard errors\u2014the standard deviation of the sample distribution of the headcount index\u2014is given by[H.(1-H)/N]for a sample of size N. For all but very small sample sizes (less than 5), a useful rule-of-thumb is that the approxi- mation involved in using the normal distribution will be accurate as long as the absolute value of{(1-H)/H}-{H/(1-H)}doesnotexceed0.3N(Boxetal.1978). 33The standard error of the FGT measure (P)is/bracketleftbig/parenleftbig P2-P2/parenrightbig /N/bracketrightbig ,w h i c hy i e l d st h ea f o r e m e n - tioned standard error for the headcount index as the special case when =0 .T h i sf o r m u l ad o e sn o t take account of survey design; typically there will be a degree of clustering in survey design that will raise standard errors of those in simple random samples; and there will be a degree of stratication that will lower them. Also one will often need to weight the observations, such as by household size. For formulae for the standard errors that deal with these common features of data, see Howes and Lanjouw(1997).AlsoseePreston(1992).Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 335Chapter XVI Presenting simple descriptive statis tics from household survey data Paul Glewwe Department of Applied Economics University of Minnesota St. Paul, Minnesota, United States of America Michael Levin United States Bureau of the Census Washington, D.C., United States of America Abstract The present chapter provides general guide lines for calculating and displaying basic descriptive statistics for household survey data. Th e analysis is basic in the sense that it consists of the presentation of relatively simple tables an d graphs that are easily understandable by a wide audience. The chapter also provides advice on how to put the tables and graphs into a general report intended for widespread dissemination. Key terms : descriptive statistics, tables, graphs , statistical abstract, dissemination. Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 336A. Introduction 1. The true value of household survey data is realized only when th e data are analysed. Data analysis ranges from analyses encompassing very simple summary statistics to extremely complex multivariate analyses. The present chapte r serves as an introduction to the next four chapters and, as such, it will fo cus on basic issues and relatively simple methods. More complex material is presented in the four chapters that follow. 2. Most household survey data can be used in a wide variety of ways to shed light on the phenomena that are the main focus of the survey . In one sense, the starting point for data analysis is basic descriptive statistics such as tables of the means and frequencies of the main variables of interest. Yet, the most fundament al starting point for data analysis lies in the questions that the data were colle cted to answer. Thus, in almost any household survey, the first task is to set the goals of the survey, and to design the survey questionnaire so that the data collected are suitable for achieving those goals. Th is implies that survey design and planning for data analysis should be carried out simultaneously before any data are collected. This is explained in more detail in chapter III. The pr esent chapter will focus on many practical aspects of data analysis, assuming that a sensible strategy for data analysis has al ready been developed following the advice given in chapter III. 3. The organization of this chap ter is as follows. Section B reviews types of variables and simple descriptive statistics; section C provide s general advice on how to prepare and present basic descriptive statistics from household su rvey data; and section D makes recommendations on how to prepare a general repor t (often called a statistical ab stract) that disseminates basic results from a household survey to a wide audi ence. The brief final section offers some concluding remarks. B. Variables and descriptive statistics 4. Many household surveys collect data on a particular topic or theme, while others collect data on a wide variety of topics . In either case, the data co llected can be th ought of as a collection of variables, some of which are of inte rest in isolation, while others are primarily of interest when compared with other variables. Ma ny of the variables will vary at the level of the household, such as the type of dwelling, while ot hers may vary at the level of the individual, such as age and marital status. Some surveys ma y collect data that vary only at the community level; an example of this is the prices of various goods sold in the local market.27 5. The first step in any data analysis is to ge nerate a data set that has all the variables of interest in it. Data analysts can then calculate basic descriptive statistics that let the variables 27 In most household surveys, the household is defined as a group of individuals who: (a) live in the same dwelling; (b) eat at least one meal toge ther each day; and (c) pool income a nd other resources for the purchase of goods and services. Some household surveys modify this definition to accommodate lo cal circumstances, but this issue is beyond the scope of this chapter. \u0093Community\u0094 is more difficult to define, but for the purposes of this chapter, it can be thought of as a collection of households th at live in the same village, town or section of a city. See Frankenberg (2000) for a detailed discussion of the definition of \u0093community\u0094. Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 337\u0093speak for themselves\u0094. There are a relatively small number of methods of doing so. The present section explains how this is done. It begins with a brief discussion of the different kinds of variables and descriptive sta tistics, and then discusses methods for presenting data on a single variable, methods for two variables, and methods for three or more variables. 1. Types of variables 6. Household surveys collect data on two types of variable s, \u0093categorical\u0094 variables and \u0093numerical\u0094 variables. Categorical variables ar e characteristics that are not numbers per se, but categories or types. Examples of categorical variables are dwelling characteristics (floor covering, wall material, type of toilet, etc.), an d individual characteristic s such as ethnic group, marital status and occupation. In practic e, one could assign code numbers to these characteristics, designating one ethnic group as \u0093code 1\u0094, another as \u0093code 2\u0094, and so on, but this is an arbitrary convention. In contrast, numeri cal variables are by thei r very nature numbers. Examples of numerical variables are the number of rooms in a dwelling, the amount of land owned, or the income of a particular household member. Throughout this chapter, th e different possible outcomes for categorical variables will be referred to as \u0093categor ies\u0094, while the different possible outcomes for numerical variables will be referred to as \u0093values\u0094. 7. When presenting data for either type of vari able, it is useful to ma ke another distinction, regarding the number of categorie s or values that a variable can take. If the number of categories/values is small, say, less than 10, then it is convenient (and informative) to display complete information on the distribution of the variable. However, if the number of values/categories is large, say, more than 10, it is usually best to di splay only aggregated or summary statistics concerning the di stribution of the variable. An example will make this point clear. In one country, the popul ation may consist of a small nu mber of ethnic groups, perhaps only four. For such a country, it is relatively easy to show in a simple table or graph the percentage of the sampled households that belong to each group. Yet, in another country, there may be hundreds of ethnic groups. It would be very tedious to present the percentage of the sampled households that fall into each of, say, 400 different groups. In most cases, it would be simpler and sufficiently informative to aggregat e the many different ethnic groups into a small number of broad categories and display the percen tage of households that fall into each of these aggregate categories. 8. The example above used a categorical variable, ethnic group, but it also applies to numerical variables. Some numerical variables, such as the number of days a person is ill in the past week, take on only a small number of values and so the entire distri bution can be displayed in a simple table or graph. Yet many other nu merical variables, such as the number of farm animals owned, can take on a large number of valu es and thus it is better to present only some summary statistics of the distribution. The main difference in the treatm ent of categorical and numerical variables arises from how to aggregat e when the number of po ssible values/categories becomes large. For categorical variables, once the decision not to show the whole distribution has been made, one has no choice but to aggr egate into broad categories. For numerical variables, it is possible to aggregate into br oad categories, but there is also the option of displaying summary statistics such as the mean , the standard deviation, and perhaps the Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 338minimum and maximum values. The following subs ection provides a brief review of the most common descriptive statistics. 2. Simple descriptive statistics 9. Tables and graphs can provide basic informa tion about variables of interest using simple descriptive statistics. These statistics include , but are not limited to, pe rcentage distributions, medians, means, and standard deviations. The pr esent subsection reviews th ese simple statistics, providing examples using household survey da ta from Saipan, which belongs to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and from American Samoa. 10. Percentage distributions. Household surveys rarely collect data for exactly 100, or 1,000 or 10,000 persons or households. Suppose that one has data on the categories of a categorical variable, such as the number of people in a population that are male and the number that are female, or data on a numerical variable, such as the age in years of the members of the same population. Presenting the numbers of observations that fall into each category is usually not as helpful as showing the percentage of the observati ons that fall into each category. This is seen by looking at the first three colu mns of numbers in table XVI.1. Most users would find it more difficult to interpret these results if they were given without percentage distributions. The last three columns in table XVI.1 are much easier to unde rstand if one is interested in the proportion of the population that is male a nd the proportion that is female for the different age groups. Of course, one may be interested in column percentage s, that is to say, the percentage of men and the percentage of women falling into different ag e groups. This is shown in table XVI.2. (A third possibility is to show percentages that a dd up to 100 per cent over all age by sex categories in the table, but this is usually of less interest.) Both tables show that percentage distributions can be shown for either categor ical or numerical variables. Table XVI.1.

This reflects something that cannot be seen in tables XVI.1 and XVI.2, namely that Saipan has many immigrant workers \u0096 particularly female workers \u0096 employed in its garment factories. While Saipan has slightly more males than females at the youngest ages, the next age group, those 15- 29 years, has only 30 males for every 70 females. Age group 30-44 also has more females than males. This is consistent with the fact that most of Saipan\u0092s garment workers are women between the ages of 20 a nd 40. In the next group, those 45-59 years of age, there are more males than females. The column percentages in table XVI.2 show that the largest age group for males was that of 30-44, while the largest age group fo r females was that of 15-29, the age group of females most likely to work in the garment factories. 12. Medians. The two most common statistical meas ures for numerical variables are means and medians. (By definition, categorical va riables are not numerical and thus one cannot calculate means and medians for su ch variables.) The median is the midpoint of a distribution, while the mean is the arithmetic average of the values. The median is often used for variables such as age and income because it is less sensit ive to outliers. As an extreme example, let us assume that there are 99 people in a survey with incomes between $8,000 and $12,000 per year, and symmetrically distributed around $10,000. Thus, the mean and the median would be $10,000. Now suppose one more person with an in come of $500,000 during the year is included, then, the mean would be about $15,000 while the median would still be about $10,000. For many income variables, published reports of ten show both the mean and the median. 13. Returning to the data from Saipan, the median age for the Saipan population was 28.5 years in April 2002, that is to say, half the population was older than 28.5 years and half was younger than 28.5 years. The female median ag e was lower than the ma le median age (27.6 Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 340versus 30.5), because of the large number of young immigrant females working in the garment factories. 14. Means and standard deviations. As noted above, the mean is the arithmetic average of a numerical variable. Means are often calculated for the number of children ever born (to women), income, and other numerical variables. The standa rd deviation measures the average distance of a numerical variable from the mean of that variable, and thus provides a measure of the dispersion in the distribution of any numerical variable. 15. Table XVI.3 shows medians and means for annual income obtained from the 1995 American Samoa Household Survey. The surv ey was a 20 per cent random sample of all households in the territory. The fact that hous ehold mean income was higher than the median income is not surprising, since some households earned significantly hi gher wages and derived higher income from other sources. Tongan immigrants are relative ly poor, as s een by their low mean and low median income; while the high m ean and high median income of \u0093other ethnic groups\u0094 indicate that they are relatively well off.

Note : Data are an unweighted, 20 per cent random sample of households. 3. Presenting descriptive statistics for one variable 16. The simplest case when pres enting descriptive stat istics from a household survey is that where only one variable is involved. The presen t subsection explains ho w this can be produced for both categorical and numerical variables. 17. Displaying the entire distribution. Categorical or numerical variables that take a small number of categories or values, say 10 or less, are the simplest to di splay. A table can be used to show the entire (percentage) distribution of the variable by presenting the frequency of each of the categories or numerical values of the variable . An example of this is given in table XVI.4, which shows the (unweighted) sample frequency c ounts and percentage dist ribution for the main sources of lighting among Vietnamese households. Many household survey s require the use of weights to estimate the distributi on of a variable in the populat ion, in which case showing the raw sample frequencies may be c onfusing and thus is not advisabl e; the use of weights will be discussed in section C below. (The survey from Viet Nam was based on a self-weighting sample Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 341and thus no weights were needed.) A final point is that it is also useful to report the standard errors of the estimated percentage frequencies (see chap. XXI for a detailed discussion of this issue, which is complicated by the use of weight s and by other features of the sample design of the survey). 18. In some cases, the number of categories or va lues taken by a variable may be large, but the major part of the distributi on is accounted for by only a few categories or values. In such cases, it may not be necessary to show the fre quency of each category or value. One option to prevent the amount of information from taxing the pa tience of the reader of a table is to combine rare cases into a general \u0093other \u0094 category. For example, any category or value with a frequency of less than 1 per cent could go into this category. Indeed, this is what was done in table XVI.4, where \u0093other\u0094 includes rare cases such as torches and flashlights. In some cases, there may be other natural groups. For example, in many countr ies, ethnic and religious groups can be divided into a large number of distinct categories, but there may be a much smaller number of broad groups into which these more precise categories fi t. In many cases, it will be sufficient to present figures only for the more general groups . The main exception to this rule concerns categories that may be of partic ular interest even though they o ccur rarely. In general, such \u0093special interest but rare \u0094 categories could be report ed separately, but it is especially important to show standard errors in such instances because the precision of the estimates is lower for rare categories. 19. In many cases, presentation of data can be ma de more interesting and more intuitive if it is displayed as a graph or chart instead of as a ta ble. For a single variable that has only a small number of categories or values, a common way to di splay data graphically is in a column chart or histogram, in which the relative fr equency of each category or value is indicated by the height of the column. Figure XVI.1 provides an example of this, using the data presented in table XVI.4. Another common way of displayini g of the relative frequency of the categories or values of a variable is the pie chart, which is a circle showing the relative frequencies in terms of the size of the \u0093slices\u0094 of the pie. An example of this is given in figure XVI.2, which also displays the information given in table XVI.4. See Tufte (1983) and Wild and Sebe r (2000) for detailed advice on how to desi gn effective graphs. Table XVI.4.

Note : Sample size: 4,800 households. 20. Displaying variables that have many categories or values. Both categorical and numerical variables often have ma ny possible categories or values. For categorical variables, the only way to avoid presenting highl y detailed tables and graphs is to aggregate categories into broad groups and/or combine all ra re values into an \u0093other\u0094 cate gory, as discussed above. For numerical variables, there are two distinct options. 21. First, one can divide the range of any numer ical variable with ma ny values into a small number of intervals and display the information in any of the ways described above for the case where a variable has only a small number of cate gories or values. For example, this was done for the age variable in tables XVI.1 and XVI.2 . This option can also be used in graphs: information on the distribution of a numerical variable that take s many values can be displayed using a graph that shows the fr equency with which th e variable falls into a small number of categories. One example of such a graph is the histogram, which approximates the density function of the underlying variable . Histograms divide the range of a numerical variable into a relatively small number of \u0093sub-ranges\u0094, commonl y called bins. Each bin is represented by a Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 343column that has an area proportional to the percenta ge of the sample that falls in the sub-range corresponding to the bin. Figure XVI.3 does this fo r the age data in table XVI.2. The first bin is the sub-range from 0 to 14; the next is the sub-range from 15 to 29, and so on.28 Note that, unlike the column chart in figure XVII.1, ther e is no distance between the \u0093columns\u0094 of the histogram. This is because the horizontal axis in a histogram de picts the range of the variable, and variables typically have no \u0093gaps\u0094 in their range. Figure XVI.3. Age distribution of the population Source : Round 10 of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Current Labour-force Survey 22. The second, and perhaps most common, optio n for displaying a numer ical variable that takes many values is to present some summary sta tistics of its distribution, such as its mean, median, and standard deviation. This can be done only by showing these statistics in a table; it is not possible to show summary statistics for a single numerical variable in a graph. In addition to the mean, median and standard deviation, it is also useful to present the minimum and maximum values, the values of th e upper and lower quartiles,29 and perhaps a measure of skewness. An example of this is given in table XVI.5. 4. Presenting descriptive statistics for two variables. 23. Examination of the relationships between tw o or more variables often offers much more insight into the underlying topic of interest than examining a single variable in isolation. Yet, at the same time the possibilities for displaying th e data increase by an order of magnitude. The 28 This histogram divides the popula tion aged 60-99 into three groups (6 0-74, 75-89 and 90-104) each of which spans the same number of years, 15, as the population groups younger than 60. This is done to ensure that the area in each column of the histogram is proportional to the percentage of the population in each age group. 29 The lower quartile of a distribution is the value for whic h 25 per cent of the observations are less than the value and 75 per cent are greater than the value, and the upp er quartile is the value for which 75 per cent of the observations are lower than the value and 25 per cent are higher than the value. Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 344present subsection describes common methods, di stinguishing between va riables that have a small number of categories or values and va riables that take a large number of values. 24. Two variables with a small num ber of categori es or values. The simplest case for displaying the relationship between two variables is that wher e both variables have a small number of categories or values. In a simple two-way tabulation, the categories or values of one variable can serve as the columns, while the cate gories or values of the other variable can serve as the rows. An example of this is shown in table XVI .6, which illustrates the use of different types of health service providers in urban and rural areas of Viet Nam. In this example, the columns sum to 100 per cent. As explained above, an alternative would be for the rows to sum to 100 per cent. In the example from Viet Na m, percentage figures that sum to 100 per cent across each row would indicate how the use of each type of health facility was distributed across urban and rural areas of Viet Nam. A third alte rnative would be for each \u0093cell\u0094 of this table to give the frequency (in percentage terms) of the (joint) probabil ity of a visit to a health-care facility by someone in a particular geographical re gion (urban or rural), in which case the sum of the percentages over all rows and columns would be 100 per cent. This is rarely used, however, since conditional distributions are usually more in teresting. In any case, it is good practice to report sufficient data so that any reader can deri ve all three types of frequencies given the data provided in the table. Table XVI.5.

Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 34525. There are several ways to use graphs to display information on th e relationship between two variables that take a small number of values. When showi ng column or row percentages, one convenient method is to show several vertical columns that sum to 100 per cent. Each column represents a particular va lue of one of the vari ables, and the frequenc y distribution of the other variable is shown as shaded areas of each column. This is shown for the health facility data from Viet Nam in figure XVI.4. Spre adsheet software packages present many other variations that one could use. Figure XVI.4.

Note: Sample size: 2,276. 26. One variable with a small number of categorie s/values and a numeric al variable with many values. Another common situation is one where th ere are two variables. One takes a small number of categories or values (perhaps after aggregating to re duce the number) and the other is a numerical variable that takes many values. He re the most common way to display the data is in terms of the mean of the num erical variable, conditional on each value of the variable that takes a small number of categories or values. One could also add other info rmation, such as the median and the standard deviation. An exampl e of this is seen in table XVI.7, which shows mean household total expenditure levels in Viet Nam in 1992-1993 with households being classified by the seven regions of that country. This could be put into a \u0093profile plot\u0094 column graph, where each column (x-axis) represents a region and the lengths of the columns (y-axis) are proportional to the mean incomes for each region. 27. Another option is to transform the continuous variable into a discrete variable by dividing its range into a small number of categories. Fo r example, it is sometimes convenient to divide households into the poorest 20 per cent, the next poorest 20 per cent, and so on, based on household income or expenditures. After this is done, one can use the same methods for displaying data for two discrete variables, as de scribed above. A specific example is to modify figure XVI.4 to show five columns, one for each income quintile. Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 34628. Two numerical variable s with many values. Statisticians often provide summary information on two numerical variab les in terms of their correlati on coefficient (the covariance of the two variables divided by the square root of the product of the variances). However, such statistics are often unfamiliar to a general audience. An alternative is to graphically display the data in a scatter-plot th at has a dot for each observation. This could show, for example, the extent to which household income is correlated over two periods of time, using observations on the same households in two different surveys (one for each period of time). Table XVI.7.

Note: Sample size: 4,799 households. 29. One problem with using scatter-plots is th at when the sample si ze is large, the graph becomes too \u0093crowded\u0094 to interp ret easily. This can be avoi ded by drawing a random subsample of the observations (for exampl e, one tenth of the observations ) to keep the diagram from becoming too crowded. Another problem with scat ter-plots is how to adjust them to account for sampling weights. One simple method is to create duplicate observations , with the sampling weight being the number of duplicates for each observation. This will almost certainly overcrowd the scatter-plot; hen ce after creating the duplicates, only a random subsample of the observations should be incl uded in the scatter plot. 5. Presenting descriptive statistics for three or more variables 30. In principle, it is possible to display relationships between three or more variables using tables and graphs. Yet, this should be done rare ly because it adds additional dimensions that complicate both the understanding of the underlying relationships and the methods for displaying them in simple tables or graphs. In practice, it is sometimes possible to show the descriptive relationships among three variable s, but it is almost never f easible to show descriptive relationships among four or more variables. 31. For three variables, the most straightforward approach is to designate one variable as the \u0093conditioning\u0094 variable. Either this variable will have a small number of discrete values or, if continuous, it will have to be \u0093d iscretized\u0094 by calculating its dist ribution over a small number of Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 347intervals over its entire range. After this is done, separate tables or graphs can be constructed for each category or value of this conditioning variable . For example, suppose one is interested in showing the relationship among three variables: the education of the head of household, the income level of the household, and the incidence of child malnutrition. This could be done by generating a separate table or graph of the re lationship between income and an indicator of children\u0092s nutritional status (suc h as the incidence of stunting) for each education level. This may show, for example, that the association be tween income and child nutrition is weaker for households with more educated heads. C. General advice for prese nting descriptive statistics 1. Data preparation 32. Before any figures to be put into tables and graphs are generated, the data must be prepared for analysis. This involves three di stinct tasks: checking the data to remove observations that may be highly inaccurate; generating complex (derived) variables; and thoroughly documenting the preparation of the \u0093official\u0094 data set to be used for all analysis. In all three tasks, extra effort and attention to detail initially may save much time and many resources in the future. The present subsection presents a brief overview of these tasks; for a much more detailed treatment the reader should consult chapter XV. 33. Virtually every household survey, no matt er how carefully pla nned and executed, will have some observations for some variables that do not appear to be cr edible. These problems range from item non-response (see chap. XI) and ot her clear errors -- for example, a three-year- old child who is designated as the head of ho usehold -- to much less clear cases, such as a household with very high income but an averag e level of household expenditures. In many cases, the errors are due to inaccurate data entry from paper questionnaires and so the paper questionnaire should be checked firs t. Such data entry errors can be easily fixed. If the strange data are on the questionnaire itself, there are seve ral options. First, one could change the value of the variable to \u0093missing\u0094. If there are only a small number of such cases, those observations can be excluded when calculating any ta ble or graph that uses that variable. 30 If there are a large number of cases, the \u0093missing\u0094 values can be ca lculated as a distinct category of a categorical variable, labelled \u0093not reported\u0094 or \u0093not stated\u0094. Second, if most of the cas es are concentrated in a small number of households, those households c ould be dropped. Third, if there are many questionable observations for many households for some variables, a decision may have to be made not to present resu lts for that variable. 34. One approach to missing data is to \u0093i mpute\u0094 missing values using one of several methods. Imputation methods assign values to unknown or \u0093not reported\u0094 cases, as well as to cases with implausible values. Approaches include the hot deck imputation and nearest neighbour methods, which allow for a \u0093best guess\u0094 for a response when none is available. The idea behind these methods is quite simple: hous eholds or people that are similar in some 30 This option has the disadvantage that the sample size w ill differ slightly for each tabl e. While this could cause confusion, a note at the bottom of each table explaining that a few observations were dropped should provide sufficient clarification. Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 348characteristics are probably also si milar in other characteristics. For example, houses in a given rural village are likely to have walls and roofs th at are similar to those of houses in other rural areas, as opposed to houses in urban areas. Simi larly, most of the people in a household will have the same religion and ethnicity. The survey team must decide on the specific rules to follow in light of the country\u0092s demogra phic, social, economic and housing conditions. 35. While imputation methods are quite useful, they also may have serious problems. The team members responsible for data analysis mu st decide whether to change missing data on a case-by-case basis or use some kind of imputati on method. The effects on the final tabulations must be considered. Imputing 1 or 2 per cent of the cases should have little or no effect on the final results. If about 5 per cent of the cases are missing or in consistent with other items, imputation should probably still be considered. However, the need to impute a much larger proportion of values, say 10 per cent or more, coul d very well make the variable unsuitable for use in display and analysis, he nce no results s hould be presented for th at variable. Readers should consult chapters VIII and XI and the refe rences therein for further advice on imputation and the handling of missing values. 36. Another aspect of data prep aration is calculation of complex (derived) variables. In many household surveys, total household income or total household expend iture, or both, are calculated based on the values of a large number of variables. Fo r example, total expenditure is typically calculated by adding up ex penditures on 100 or more specific food and non-food items. While in theory, calculating these variables is straightforward, in practice many problems can arise. For example, in calculating the farm re venues and expenditures of rural households, it is sometimes the case that farm profits are negati ve. When strange results occur for specific households, it may help to look at each of the components that go into the overall calculation. One or two may stand out as the cause of the pr oblem. Continuing with the example of farm profits, it may be that the price of some purchased i nput is unusually high. In this case, the profit could be recalculated using an average price. 37. Unfortunately, preparing the data sets when problems arise is more of an art than a science. Decisions will have to be made when it is not clear whic h choice is the best. Finally, it is important to document the choices made and, more generally, to document the entire process by which the \u0093raw data\u0094 are transformed into tables and graphs. The documentation should include a short narrative about the process plus all the computer programs that manipulated and transformed the data. 2. Presentation of results 38. The best way to present basic statistical resu lts will vary according to the type of survey and the audience. However, some general advice can be given that should apply in almost all cases. 39. The most important general piece of advice is to present re sults clearly. This implies several more specific recommendations. First, all variables must be defined precisely and clearly. For example, when presenting tables and graphs on household \u0093income\u0094, the income variable should be either \u0093per capita income\u0094 or \u0093total household income\u0094, never just \u0093income\u0094. Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 349Complex variables such as income and expenditure should be defined clearly in the text and in footnotes to tables and graphs. Does income re fer to income before or after taxes? Does it include the value of owner-occupied housing? Does income refer to income per week, per month or per year? This must be completely clea r. For many variables, it is very useful to present in the text the wording in the household questionnaire from which the variable has been derived. For example, for data on adult literacy , it should be very clear how this variable has been defined. It may be defined by the numbe r of years the person has attended school, or the person\u0092s ability to sign his or he r name, or the respondent\u0092s statement that he or she can read a newspaper; or it may be based on some kind of test given to the respondent. Different definitions can give very different results. 40. A second specific recommendation regarding clar ity is that percentage distributions of discrete variables should be ve ry clear as to whether they ar e percentages of households or percentages of people (that is to say, of the population). In many cases, these will give different results. In many countries, better-educated indi viduals have relatively small families. This implies that the proportion of the population livi ng in households with well-educated heads is smaller than the proportion of households that have a well-educated head. A third recommendation regarding clarity is that gr aphs should show the numbers underlying the graphical shapes. For example, the column chart in figure XVI.1 shows the percentages for each of three sources of lighting among Vietnamese house holds, and the same is true of the pie chart in figure XVI.2. 41. Finally, there are several other miscellaneous pieces of advice. First, reports should not present huge numbers of tables and a vast array of numbers in each table. Statistical agencies sometimes present hundreds of tables giving minute deta ils that are unlikely to be of interest to most audiences, and a similar point often applies concerning the detail in a given table. Staff preparing reports should discuss the purpose of the various tables that are being prepared, and if little use can be perceived in presenting a particul ar table or the detailed information in a given table, then the extraneous information should be excluded. Second, estimates of sampling errors should be reported for a selection of the most im portant variables collec ted in the survey; in addition, it is highl y useful to show the confid ence intervals for key variab les or indicators. This is an obvious point, but it is often overlooked. It emphasizes the importa nce of conveying to the reader the degree of precision of the informat ion provided by the househol d survey. Third, the sample sizes should be given for each table. 3. What constitutes a good table 42. The present subsection offers specific a dvice about preparing tables that present information from a household survey. When prep aring tables and graphs, the following general principle applies: the informati on the tables include s hould be sufficient to enable the user to interpret them correctly without ha ving to consult the text of the re port. This is highly important because many users of reports photocopy tables and later use them wit hout reference to the accompanying text. 43. The advice given below is general in nature. For any survey, the survey team must decide which conventions are mo st appropriate. Once the conven tions are chosen, they should Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 350be very strictly followed. However, in some cases, divergence from the conventions may be necessary to illustrate specific points or to display specific types of statistical analyses. A final point regarding this subsection is that almost all of these guide lines for tables also apply to graphs. 44. The various parts of a good table are included in table XVI.6. Each table should contain: a clear title; geographical designators appropriate); column headers; stub (row) titles; the data source; and any notes that are relevant. 45. Title. The title should provide a succ inct description of the tabl e. This description should include: (a) the table number; (b ) the population or other universe under consideration (including the unit of analysis, such as households or indivi duals; (c) an indication of what appears in the rows; (d) an indication of what appears in the columns; (e) the country or region covered by the survey; and (f) the year(s) of the survey. 46. Regarding the table number, most statisti cal reports number their tables consecutively, starting with table XVI.1, and continuing through to the last table. Sometimes countries use letters and numbers for different tables sets, for example, H01, H02, etc., for housing tables, and P01, P02, etc., for population tables. While this pr ocedure is simple and st raightforward, it has the disadvantage that reports become locked into the numbering, making additions or deletions very cumbersome. 47. The universe is the population or housing base covered by the table. If all of the population is included in the table, then the un iverse can be omitted from the title: the total population is assumed. In contrast, if a table encompasses a subpopulation su ch as persons in the labour force, and the potential labour force is define d as persons aged 10 y ears or over, then the title might contain the phrase \u0093 P opulation aged 10 years or over\u0094. 48. The title of table XVI.6 also includes an indication of what appears in the rows and what appears in the columns of the table. In particul ar, it states that the table presents information on types of health facilities used (the rows) and shows this information separately for urban and rural areas (the columns). Including the countr y or region in the titl e makes the geographical universe immediately apparent. This feature is most important for researchers comparing results between countries. Obviously, the country statistical office collectin g the data will know its own country name; but persons using ta bles from different countries may need this information in order to distinguish between the countries. 49. Finally, the year(s) of the survey should be in the title to make the time frame immediately apparent. Sometimes, a country\u0092s nati onal statistics agency ma y want to show data from two or more different surveys in the same table. Then two dates may appear, for example \u00931990 and 2000\u0094 or \u00931980 through 2000\u0094. The survey team must ma ke a decision about whether it wants to write out a series of dates (for example, \u00931980, 1990 and 2000\u0094, rather than the simpler, but less complete, \u00931980 through 2000\u0094); once the decision has been made, however, the country should always follow its decision. Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 35150. Geographical designators. Whenever the same table is repeated for lower levels of geography, each table should have a geographical designator to cl arify which table applies to which geographical region. For example, if tabl e XVI.6 were repeated for each of Viet Nam\u0092s seven regions, the name of the region could app ear in parentheses in a second line immediately below the title of the table. \u0093N on-geographical\u0094 designators could also be used. For example, a table might be repeated for majo r ethnic groups or nationalities. 51. Column headers . Each column of a table must be labelled with a \u0093header\u0094. Column headers can have more than one \u0093level\u0094; for exam ple, in table XVI.6, the header for the first two columns is designated as \u0093Urban areas\u0094 and the h eader for the last two is designated as \u0093Rural areas\u0094; and within both urban a nd rural areas, there are separate headers for the frequency of observations and for the percentage distribution of those observations . Another point pertains to columns of \u0093totals\u0094 or \u0093sums\u0094, su ch as the first column of tabl e XVI.3. The survey team should choose a convention with respect to where these columns will be placed. Traditionally, the total comes last, with all of the attributes shown fi rst across the columns. However, if a table continues for multiple pages, with many columns of information, the survey team may prefer to have the total first (at the left) for the series of columns. When the total appears first, any user will immediately know the total for that series of columns, without having to page through all of the table. 52. Column headers and their associated column s of data should be spaced to minimize blank space on the page. Spacing of columns needs to take into account the number of digits in the maximum figures to appear in the columns, the nu mber of letters in the names of the attributes appearing in the columns, and the total number of \u0093spaces\u0094 allowed by the particular font being used. The font used is very important, and shou ld be chosen early in the tabulation process. 53. Stub (row) titles. The survey team must also determ ine conventions to be used for stub (row) headings and titles. Stub \u0093headings\u0094 should be left justified and only one variable should be listed on each line. Stub headings should cons ist of the names of variables displayed in the row. Stubs may include subcategories (nested variables). For example, a stub \u0093group\u0094 may have two separate rows, one for male and one for female . Some conventions need to be established to distinguish between the differ ent stub groups; the convention usually involves different indentation for different \u0093l evels\u0094 of variables. 54. Precision of numbers . Many tables suffer from pres enting too many significant digits. When percentages are shown, it is almost alwa ys sufficient to include only one digit beyond the decimal point; presenting two or more digits ra rely provides useful information and has three disadvantages: it distracts the reader, wastes sp ace, and conveys a false sense of precision. Numbers with four or more digits rarely need an y decimal point at all. When large numbers are displayed, they should appear in \u0093thousands\u0094 or \u0093m illions,\u0094 so that no numbe rs of more than four or five digits appear. 55. Source. The source of the data should appear as the complete name of the survey, usually at the bottom of the table (as seen in table XVI .6). However, sometimes tabulations display more than one survey for a country, or surveys from more than one country. When this happens, the information in the sources b ecomes more important. The da te should be included along with Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 352the name of the survey. If the source is a publishe d report, it is useful to distinguish between the date of publication of the report and the year of data collection. For example, a country might have collected data in 1990, but published the data in 1992. Hence, the source might read \u00931990 Fertility Survey, 1992\u0094 with 1992 indi cating the date of publication. 56. Notes . Notes provide immediate information with which to properly interpret the results shown in the table. For example, the notes to tables XVI.1 and XVI.2 i ndicate that the sampled population includes all persons living in either individual dwellings or colle ctives. In addition to notes at the bottom of a table, a series of defin itions and explanations might appear in the text accompanying the tables. The text would include the definitions of the characteristics, for example, it would indicate that the birthplace referr ed to the mother\u0092s living quarters just prior to going to the hospital to deliver, rather than to th e hospital location. The text might also include explanations regarding how the data were obtained or are to be used . For example, if the date of birth and age were both collected, but date of birth superseded ag e when they were inconsistent, this information might assist certain users, lik e demographers, in assessing the best method of interpreting the data. 4. Use of weights 57. The present subsection provides a brief ove rview of the use of weights when producing tables and graphs using household survey data. For much more detailed tr eatment, see chapters II, VI, XIX, XX and XXI and the references therein. 58. With respect to survey wei ghting, the simplest type of hous ehold survey sample design is the \u0093self-weighted\u0094 type. In such a case, no we ights need actually be used in the analysis because each household in the population has the same probability of being selected in the sample. The 1992-1993 Viet Nam Li ving Standards Survey used in several of the examples in this chapter was such a survey. Yet, variati on in response rates across different types of households usually implies that weights should be cal culated to correct for such variation. More importantly, most household surveys are not self-w eighted because they draw disproportionately large samples for some parts of the population that are of particular interest. For these surveys, weights must be used to reflect the differential probabilities of selection in order to properly calculate unbiased estimates of the char acteristics of interest to the survey. 59. Accurate weights must incorporate three components. The first encompasses the \u0093base weights\u0094 or \u0093design weights\u0094. These account for variation in the selection pr obabilities across different groups of households (t hat is to say, when the samp le is not self-weighting) as stipulated by the survey\u0092s initial sample de sign. The second component is adjustment for variation in non-response rate s. For example, in many developing countries, wealthier households are less likely to agree to be inte rviewed than are middle-income and lower-income households. The base weights need to be \u0093inflated\u0094 by the invers e of the response rate for all groups of households. Finally, in some cases, there may be \u0093pos t-stratification adjustments\u0094. The rationale for post-stratificati on is that an independent data source, such as a census, may provide more precise estimates of the distribution of the population by age, sex and ethnic group. If the survey estimates of these distributi ons do not closely correspond to those of the independent source, the survey data may be re-wei ghted to force the two distributions to agree. Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 353For a more detailed account of the second and third components, see Lundstr\u00f6m and S\u00e4rndal (1999). D. Preparing a general report (abstract) for a household survey 60. Most household surveys first disseminate their results by publishing a general report which contains a modest amount of detail on all of the information collected in the survey. Such reports usually have much wider circulation than do more specialized repor ts that make full use of certain aspects of the data. These general reports are sometimes called \u0093statistical abstracts\u0094. The present section provides some specific re commendations for producing these reports, based on Grosh and Mu\u00f1oz (1996). 1. Content 61. The main material in any general statistical re port is a large number of tables and graphs. They should reflect all of the main kinds of inform ation collected in the su rvey; in-depth analysis of more narrow topics should be left to more focused special reports. A small amount of text should accompany the tables, just enough to clarify the type of information in those tables. There is no need to draw particular policy c onclusions, although possible interpretations can be suggested as fruitful areas for future research. 62. The most basic information can be broke n down by geographical regions, by sex and, perhaps, by age. If the survey contains inco me or expenditure data, they can also be broken down by income or expenditure groups. In some countries, there will be large differences across these different groups, and the nature of these di fferences can be explored further in additional tables. In other countries, some of these differen ces will not be very large, so there will be no need to present more detail. 63. In addition to the results from the househol d survey data, the gene ral report should have several pages describing th e survey itself, including the sample size and the design of the sample, the date of the survey\u0092s start and the date of its termination, and some detail on how the data were collected. The questionnaire or questionnaires used should be included as an annex to the main report. 2. Process 64. A good general statistical report is produced by a team of people, se veral of whom will ideally have had experience on previous reports. Some team members will focus on the technical aspects of generating tables and graphs, while others will mainly be responsible for the content and the text accompanying the tables. Th e more technically-oriented team members can choose the statistical software with which they ar e most familiar, since mo st statistical software are able to produce the figures needed for the tables and graphs. However, estimation of standard errors will likely require software specifically de signed for that purpose, since household survey sample designs are virtually al ways too complex to be handled properly by standard statistical software packages (see ch apter XXI for a discussion of these issues). Household Sample Surveys in Devel oping and Transition Countries 35465. The team members responsible for the cont ent should meet with experts in government agencies regarding the topics to be included in th e report. This will ensure that the tables and graphs present the data in a form most useful to those agencies. It might prove useful as well to consult international aid agenci es, which could also find the data useful in planning their programmes (see chap. III for a more general disc ussion of how to form an effective survey team). E. Concluding comments 66. This chapter has provided an introduction to the presentation of simple descriptive statistics using household survey data. The treatm ent has been very genera l, and undertaken at a very basic level. As much of what has been pr esented constitutes little more than common sense, data analysts should use their own common sense when facing particular issues regarding the analysis of their surveys. Mo re sophisticated methods can also be used to analyse household survey data, some of which are discussed in la ter chapters. All things considered, the data analysis for any given household su rvey will have to be tailored to the main topics and objectives of the survey, and researchers will have to consult speciali zed books and journals to obtain guidance on issues specific to those topics.
