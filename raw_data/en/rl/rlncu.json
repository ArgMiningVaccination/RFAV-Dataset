Trip Shows Maine Delegation Support October 22, 2012 For more information contact: Jeanne Curran at: (207) 287-3156 AUGUSTA, Maine ? State agriculture officials are calling their visit to Washington D.C. ?an important step? in dealing with the issue of the expired 2008 Farm Bill and its damaging impact on several sections of the rural economy, especially Maine?s dairy farmers. ?Maine is involved in offering solutions and is partnering with interested office holders,? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) said about his visit. ?We discussed with the entire Maine delegation the impact of expired programs that support research, senior citizens, organic certification and dairy. The trip showed how critical and engaged our Maine congressional delegation is.? During the trip to the U.S. Capitol, Whitcomb met with Maine delegation staff members, U.S. Department of Agriculture officials, Senate Agricultural Committee staff, and delegation members of other states, to discuss Maine?s next options regarding the Farm Bill. The ACF commissioner said he also wanted to assure the continuing support for the Farm Bill amendment sponsored by U.S. Sens. Olympia Snowe and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. The high cost of feed and fuel, coupled with the Midwest drought and a federal milk pricing system based on a speculative market system, have caused production costs to skyrocket for Maine dairy producers in recent months. The recently expired federal Farm Bill has provided a price protection program known as the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program. Despite the efforts of such federal legislators as U.S. Sen. Snowe, no action was taken on the Farm Bill before Congress left for its recess, putting in limbo a number of programs critical in Maine, including the MILC program. The Snowe-Gillibrand Amendment was passed in the U.S. Senate version of the Farm Bill by a vote of 66-33. The amendment requires the USDA to report back to Congress the impact of the current system of federal milk marketing orders, which is now based on cheese and butter futures sold at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Maine milk prices should have a local, not federal, origin, according to Maine agriculture officials. Whitcomb said the official visit confirmed that the Snowe-Gillibrand Amendment still was supported -- not only by Maine?s delegation, which gave its unanimous approval, but also by other state delegations. It also gave the Maine officials an opportunity to express their concern over the devastating effects of milk prices on Maine and the region, he said. While it is unknown what will happen in Congress following the November election, several options are possible in November and December. ?We went to Washington both to measure the level of support for the potential passage of the Snowe-Gillibrand Amendment, which is very strong, and to deliver the message that things are very difficult in Maine,? Commissioner Whitcomb said. ?I think we were able to accomplish both goals and convey the message of urgency.? Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner to Speak at Regional Collegiate Dairy Event November 1, 2012 For more information contact: Jeanne Curran at: (207) 287-3156 AUGUSTA, Maine ? Commissioner Walter Whitcomb of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry will be the guest speaker this week at the Northeast Regional Intercollegiate Dairy Challenge in Waterville. Commissioner Whitcomb has been invited to address the participants during their annual dinner at 6 p.m., Friday, Nov. 2, at the Waterville Elks Club. ?Encouraging these future dairy leaders and supporting this unique educational opportunity is an honor for the Maine organizers, and I am pleased to have the chance to offer my observations regarding Maine?s natural-resource economy,? Commissioner Whitcomb said. ?This competitive, educational event will showcase some of Maine?s best farms in one of our largest agricultural industries.? Maine has 306 dairy farms located throughout the state, ranging in size from 10 cows to 1,700 cows. Dairy farms manage 700,000 acres of farmland and woodland and support more than 5,000 jobs directly and indirectly. The dairy industry has an annual impact of $570 million on Maine?s economy. The Northeast Regional Dairy Challenge is being held in Maine for the first time. The three-day event is cosponsored by the University of Maine Cooperative Extension and the Maine Department of Animal and Veterinary Sciences. David Marcinkowski, associate professor and UMaine Extension dairy specialist, is host coordinator and lead organizer for the event. More than 120 undergraduate animal and dairy science majors from 14 colleges throughout the Northeast U.S. and Canada will form five teams and evaluate local dairy farms, making and presenting financial management recommendations. Three local farms ? Stonyvale Farm, The Wright Place and Piper Hill Farm ? are allowing the teams to analyze their records. Judges then will grade the teams on presentation skills, farm analysis and recommendations. The event also will include a technology seminar for local dairy producers led by dairy industry sponsors and researchers who will attend the dairy challenge. The technology seminar will be 12 noon ? 3:30 p.m., Friday, Nov. 2 at the Waterville Elks Club.

The Maine Forest Ranger Incident Management Team (ME-IMT), mobilized to New York City on Oct. 31, has been successful in helping with the relief efforts for survivors of Hurricane Sandy. For the last few days, the team, made up of seven Maine Forest Service (MFS) forest rangers, a chief deputy sheriff and a communications specialist, has worked in a coastal area of the borough of Queens that was devastated by the storm surge and still without power. ?We have seen a lot of devastated areas hit hard from Hurricane Sandy,? said MFS Forest Ranger Jeff Currier, ME-IMT incident commander. ?We are glad to be here and helping those in need. If the tables were turned, I?m sure our friends in New York would help us with a large-scale disaster in Maine.? Many federal, state and city agencies are working together to provide much-needed supplies to those affected by the storm. The Maine IMT members are using their expertise in managing large-scale incidents to help organize and distribute much needed supplies such as food, water and blankets. MFS forest rangers, under the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, also have visited dozens of emergency distribution sites and helped solve problems, such as making sure an engine assigned to the incident was delivered to one of the coastal volunteer fire departments. In this case, the storm surge had ruined the fire department?s vehicles and local firefighters had nothing with which to respond to fire and rescue calls. Despite the evacuation order from the New York City Mayor?s Office, thousands of people remain in these areas, trying to clean up the mess from the storm. With the recent colder temperatures, there have been several structure fires and medical calls from people being careless with candles and generators. The Maine IMT currently is working out of its Mobile Command Vehicle, which is located at the Logistic Staging Area at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn. Team members fortunately were able to get fuel for their trucks at this location. New York City residents currently are dealing with a gasoline shortage, due to the lack of power at the refineries.

The State will receive nearly $74,000 in restitution for its suppression of a fire that burned 2 acres atop Big Spencer Mountain in August. A District Court judge in Dover-Foxcroft ordered restitution of $73,972.96 to be paid over five years by Richard Wes Coers, of Utah, who pleaded no contest on Monday to a summons of failure to extinguish the fire on the mountain, which is 20 miles north of Greenville. Coers will also pay a $490 fine. The fire started when embers from an unpermitted burn pile of leftover construction materials on top of the mountain was blown by a helicopter airlifting a communications building to the site. Maine Forest Service rangers and local volunteers led an impressive firefighting effort by ground and air ? including dropping 44,880 gallons of water on the fire from helicopters ? before eventually extinguishing it. ?This was an expensive mistake and the Maine Forest Service should be commended for quickly putting out the fire and bringing this case to a resolution,? said Commissioner Walter Whitcomb of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. ?As a reminder, fire permits protect people and our natural resources and are easy to obtain.?

Mobilized just two days after the devastating storm hit the city, the nine-member team spent this past week working with the New York City Department of Health and the New York National Guard in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn. The Maine team managed three separate medical-assistance teams comprised of security personnel from the National Guard, paramedics and New York City health officials that conducted more than 21,000 door-to-door health and wellness checks in nearly 200 high-rise buildings affected by the storm. ?Maine was very fortunate to be spared from Sandy, and it is our honor and duty to help our neighbors to the south as they recover and rebuild,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?I want to thank this team of forest rangers and the many other Mainers who have also stepped up to serve for their efforts and for representing the great and generous spirit of our State.? Commissioner Walter Whitcomb of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, which oversees the Maine Forest Service, agreed. ?We are very proud of the much-needed assistance provided by our Maine forest rangers and are glad they are all home safe and sound,? he said. ?I know their extensive experience alleviated some of the pain and suffering still being endured by Hurricane Sandy victims.? The goal of the health assessments organized by the Maine team was to check on the well-being of residents who live in high-rise buildings and to determine if they had any health issues. The three teams also helped fill dozens of medical prescriptions for those unable to get to their pharmacies. Many of these residents have been without heat, hot water or electricity since the storm surge from Hurricane Sandy ruined electrical systems and flooded basement furnaces. The Maine team members supported restoration efforts by tracking the number of buildings visited and prescriptions filled, providing detailed digital maps of the locations and facilitating meetings with federal, state and city officials. Emily Ashton, a New York City Health Department senior advisor, thanked the Maine Incident Management Team for their efforts and said that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg daily reviewed the data they produced. ?Before the Maine forest rangers and the National Guard arrived, we were unorganized and were limited to groups of volunteers for the wellness checks,? Ashton commented. ?The forest rangers provided clear, crisp direction and helped us get the job done way ahead of schedule.? Maine Forest Ranger Jeff Currier, team leader, said he was pleased to be part of such a meaningful mission. ?It truly was an honor to help the Hurricane Sandy victims and support the New York City Health Department and the New York National Guard,? he said. ?While the setting may be different than we are used to working in, our skills with managing large-scale incidents such as wildfires and hurricanes were utilized and appreciated.?

As part of its commitment to supporting the state?s farm- and forest-based businesses, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) has established a website outlining other states? restrictions on importing cut trees and wreaths. Maine decorative-plant shippers who are sending Christmas trees and wreaths around the country for the holiday season can save money and lost products by noting important regulations enforced by other states. States such as California are impounding and destroying shipments to prevent infestation by invasive insects and the spread of plant diseases, said Ann Gibbs, Maine state horticulturist. ?Import requirements for cut trees and wreaths with ornamental nuts and fruit arrangements exist to protect regional agriculture or other commodities from the risk of plant pests,? Gibbs explained. ?Unfortunately, some Maine shippers have learned about these regulations the hard way and have had shipments impounded and destroyed. We want to prevent any losses by getting the word out now. Our best advice is to check out-of-state orders in advance, especially those headed to California, and to make sure they are free of scale on the needles.? Distributors also should identify their products clearly through labeling, beginning with the statement, ?Grown in Maine,? followed by the county of origin and the name and address of the shipper. Labels should indicate the contents of packages, including the different types of greenery, nuts, fruits and cones used to decorate wreaths. ?This information benefits the shipper by speeding along deliveries,? Gibbs said. ?That is very important in this time-sensitive industry.? An informational sheet, ?Know State Regulations When Shipping Wreaths and Trees,? is available on the ACF website at www.maine.gov/agriculture/horticulture/ship.htm or by contacting Sarah Scally at (207)287-3891 or sarah.h.scally@maine.gov.

State officials and guests had the opportunity on Thursday to visit the new ShelterMe horse program that has inmates at the Bolduc Correctional Facility in Warren rehabilitating hard-to-adopt horses ? and themselves. ShelterMe ? the first program of its kind in Maine to involve horses and prisoners ? is a collaborative effort between the Maine departments of Corrections and Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF) that uses inmates at the Bolduc facility to care for and work with horses that are difficult to place in adoption. Corrections Commissioner Joseph Ponte and ACF Commissioner Walter Whitcomb were joined by board members of the Maine State Society for the Protection of Animals including Sen. Bill Diamond (D-Windham) and other visitors in meeting the first two horses being cared for by facility inmates through the innovative program and touring the renovated horse barn at the correctional center. ?This is a program that suits the needs of a specific group of offenders, and it is having a positive outcome for both them and the horses. It also is a chance to give back to the community,? Commissioner Ponte said. ?The ShelterMe program has so many positive aspects,? agreed Commissioner Whitcomb. ?It gives the inmates confidence and it gives care to the animals, and it?s also reviving an historic Maine farmstead. It?s a win-win situation for everyone.? Currently two older horses ? Lincoln and Bradley ? are living at the center, and two prisoners are caring for them. The program hopes to take in more horses in the coming months and can house as many as six, managed by three to four prisoner-caretakers who are paid a $150 stipend out of the prisoners? account and is not from taxpayers. DACF?s Animal Welfare Program provides funding toward veterinary costs and cost of special feed for the horses; hay is grown and provided by the prison, which also renovated and maintains the stable for the horses. The Bolduc Correctional Facility was built in the early 1930s as a farm barracks for the Maine State Prison. Known then as the \"Prison Farm,? it grew to be one of the largest dairy and beef farms in Maine. It closed in 1970, and the center became a vocational training center for prisoners. Through a public referendum, Bolduc was transformed and renovated starting in 1990 into the current Bolduc Correctional Facility, with Ben Beal as the facility director. The center has 122 male prisoners, with a population capacity of 222, and 65 staff members. The custody level of prisoners is minimum/community for inmates with less than three years remaining on their sentences. ### Supporting documents [(Photo courtesy of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry)Lincoln, a rehabilitation horse at the ShelterMe horse program, Bolduc Correctional Facility, Warren, gets a last-minute bit of grooming from his caretaker, Chris, before being shown at a public presentation on Thursday, Nov. 15.

A new report from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry reveals that there are 145 different species of spiders on and around Mount Katahdin, including five that have been previously unidentified. The Maine Forest Service report is based on the scientific collection and identification work done by scientists Daniel T. Jennings, Charles D. Dondale and James H. Redner from Maine and Canada and provides scientific knowledge that could provide baseline information on habitat and recreational-use effects in the park, according to Charlene Donahue, MFS forest entomologist. None of the 145 different species of spiders found were poisonous, as Maine has no native poisonous spiders, the MFS forest entomologist said. The five previous unidentified species are unique to the North American alpine environment found on Katahdin and some of them have also been found on Mt. Washington and in Quebec. Some Katahdin specimens are available in the MFS insect collection, while others are being kept at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass. As part of its mission, the state?s Forest Service frequently publishes technical reports on a variety of scientific subjects, from invasive insects to silviculture, as a way to support Maine landowners, forest managers and businesspeople.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, in partnership with the Downeast Lakes Land Trust, announces the completion of a major conservation project in Washington County. Effective today, the State of Maine has acquired an easement on more than 21,000 acres of land in and near Grand Lake Stream. The West Grand Lake Forest Conservation Easement guarantees continued public access on popular recreation lands for hunting, fishing, trapping, snowmobiling, hiking, snowshoeing, canoeing, kayaking and other activities. It also ensures that the lands will continue to be available for sustainable timber and fiber production. ?Maine?s natural resources are the backbone of our economy,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?The Grand Lake Stream area has outstanding fisheries, wildlife and scenic resources that make it an attraction for recreationists from around the world while supporting the highest concentration of Registered Maine Guides in the State. ?The historic working forests that have safeguarded these natural assets are now assured for the future,? the Governor added. In total, the easement conserves 21,870 acres and is funded with State, Federal and private monies. It includes 17 miles of shoreline on West Grand, Big and Lower Oxbrook lakes, wraps around the village of Grand Lake Stream and conserves a quarter-mile on the west side of Grand Lake Stream above Big Falls. Moreover, it protects 93 miles of frontage on streams, including Big Musquash Stream and a number of native brook trout streams. Additionally, the easement provides an option for the State to construct a new carry-in boat access on the east shore of West Grand Lake. ?We are very pleased to be acquiring the public recreational access rights provided by this easement,? said Walt Whitcomb, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. ?These lands support traditional uses, including hunting and fishing, and the easement also guarantees continuation of the primary ATV and snowmobile trails that cross the property.? The Downeast Lakes Land Trust partnered with the State to propose the project to the U.S. Forest Service?s Forest Legacy Program and the Land for Maine?s Future (LMF) Program. The Forest Service selected this locally led project as the number one national forest conservation priority in 2011. The project also garnered a top rating in the 2011 round of proposals considered by the LMF Board. Maine?s congressional delegation was instrumental in securing the necessary funding. ?As a long-time supporter of the Forest Legacy Program and a member of the Senate Interior Appropriations Committee, I am particularly pleased to see the completion of the West Grand Lake Forest Easement,? said U.S. Senator Susan Collins. ?The priceless assets protected here are vital to Maine?s tourism. I?ve seen firsthand the strong support of the local community for this conservation effort, and I admire the dedication of the people of Grand Lake Stream to conserve the natural resources that sustain their economy and support Maine?s timber industry.?

Four Maine State Parks Will Feature Guided 'First Day' Hikes December 24, 2012 For more information contact: Jay Finegan at: 207-287-3156 AUGUSTA ? Last year, more than 230 Mainers came out on New Year?s Day for short, guided hikes in four state parks. Park officials hope for an even stronger turnout this January 1, when guided hikes will take place at Sebago Lake State Park, Popham Beach State Park, Wolfe?s Neck Woods State Park and Aroostook State Park. ?A healthy lifestyle for 2013 could perhaps start with a brisk outdoor hike in one of Maine?s outstanding state parks,? noted Walt Whitcomb, Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF). ?First Day Hikes is a national initiative through a group called America?s State Parks, with participation by all the State park systems in the country,? said Will Harris, Director of the Parks and Public Lands Division of the ACF Department. ?Last New Year?s Day, there were some 400 outings across the country. This year, more than 600 are planned. It?s growing quickly.? In Maine, the four First Day Hikes range from less than half a mile to 1.5 miles. Parks and Public Lands staffers will lead the outings and interpret the features of the surrounding natural habitat. All four trails are rated as easy or moderate hikes. Admission to the parks is free for participants and there is no charge for the guided hikes. ?This is a great way to start the New Year by getting out and enjoying some of the best of what Maine has to offer,? Harris said. ?We hope it will encourage folks to continue to visit our parks all year long.? Here are some basics on Maine?s First Day Hikes: *Sebago Lake State Park (Naples) ? The 1.5 mile hike begins at 10:30 a.m., starting at park headquarters at 11 Park Access Road. The degree of difficulty is rated moderate. An adult must accompany children, and dogs must be leashed. This hike will offer views of the Songo River, and guides will discuss the mixed woodland habitat and the geologic history of the park. Park contact number: (207-) 693-6231. *Popham Beach State Park (Phippsburg) ? This one-mile hike, rated as easy, begins at 9:30 a.m. and lasts about an hour. Adults must accompany children, but all ages are welcome. Hikers will explore the beach during the first low tide of the New Year. Hike leaders have created a ?beach bingo? game so participants can ?rove between our series of beach stations and learn about the creatures of the intertidal zone.? Hikers at this popular park also will learn about the ever-changing beach and dunes and the natural dynamics that form, destroy and remake them. Park contact number: (207-) 389-1335. *Wolfe?s Neck Woods State Park (Freeport) ? This is the shortest of Maine?s First Days hikes, just one-third of a mile. Participants will meet at the picnic shelter by the second parking lot. The event runs from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. and all ages are welcome, but dogs are not suitable for this guided walk. This hike provides views of Casco Bay along the way and discussion about how the plants and animals in the park survive the winter. Park contact number: (207-) 865-4465. *Aroostook State Park (Presque Isle) ? This easy to moderate 1.5-mile hike begins at 9 a.m. and runs until 11:30 a.m. Hikers will meet at the main parking lot. Dogs are allowed but must be on a leash at all times and are allowed on snowshoe trails but not on ski trails. Event organizers advise bringing snowshoes and cross country skis if there is enough snow to use them. The hike is planned as a woods tour through a typical northern Maine forest, with opportunities to see many types of birds and animal tracks.

More than 5,000 farmers, woodland owners, livestock breeders, equipment suppliers and interested visitors will gather at the Augusta Civic Center next week for the 72nd annual Maine Agricultural Trades Show, one of the state?s largest agricultural events. Hosted by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (ACF), the show runs from January 8-10 and is free to attend. Governor Paul R. LePage will be on hand for the show?s opening to meet Maine farmers and recognize agriculture?s vital contribution to the state?s economy. ?Food producers are some of our most valuable economic and community assets,? the Governor said. ?Agriculture has always been a major pillar of Maine?s economy, and this show does a great job of showcasing the importance of our land-based agriculture and forestry enterprises. Thousands of Maine jobs are involved in the growing, transporting, processing and marketing of the widest array of produce in the Northeast.? This year?s show will feature dozens of lectures, demonstrations and meetings involving some 40 major agricultural organizations and agencies, as well as more than 150 exhibits featuring the latest in agricultural and forestry products, equipment and services. ?The Trades Show provides an excellent opportunity for farmers, foresters and trade groups to stay current on a wide variety of issues, from cheese-making to the federal Farm Bill to maple syrup production to farm business management,? said ACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?The additional assets of the now-combined departments of agriculture, conservation and forestry give us more resources as we widen our expertise in the continuously growing fields of food and fiber production.? The show also offers a wealth of knowledge for non-farmers to learn about agriculture and how locally grown food is harvested and processed. As more Mainers look to grow their own gardens and raise animals, workshops will be available for these beginning farmers to understand what it takes to start a small farm and get assistance in creating a plan. The main auditorium will feature a stage with periodic floral design demonstrations presented by the Maine State Florists Association as well as the annual finals competition for the best home-baked pie as selected by agricultural fairs during the previous summer. The State Pie Baking Contest will be held on Wednesday night. The show also provides an opportunity for growers, pesticide applicators and pesticide distributors to get up to speed on the latest developments in pest management and earn credits required for pesticide license recertification. The Maine Board of Pesticides Control and the University of Maine Cooperative Extension will offer 11 one-hour training sessions. Additional pesticide credits will be available at workshops run by the Maine Christmas Tree Association, the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association (MOFGA), the Maine Florists Association, the Maine Vegetable and Small Fruit Growers Association and the Maine State Pomological Society. At the Commissioner?s Luncheon on Tuesday, which will feature Maine-grown food, Commissioner Whitcomb will honor the legacy of this year?s recipient of the Commissioner?s Distinguished Service Award. The 2013 award was presented to Russell Libby, longtime executive director of MOFGA, before he passed away in early December. The Governor is scheduled to offer remarks at the luncheon. The show will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., on Tuesday, Jan. 8; from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., on Wednesday, Jan. 9; and from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., on Thursday, Jan. 10.

The plan reflects changes made to the State?s Allagash statutes since adoption of the last plan in 1999, and presents policies, goals and strategies for the management and recreational use of the Waterway. After two years of development and broad input from stakeholders, the new plan was signed on December 20 by DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb and Will Harris, Director of the Division of Parks and Public Lands. Five-year periodic reviews will keep the plan up to date. The Allagash Wilderness Waterway (AWW) is a spectacular, 92-mile long waterway that, in 1970, became the first state-administered river approved for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic River system as a Wild River Area. The State of Maine purchased the land along the waterway after Maine voters overwhelmingly approved a $1.5 million bond issue. The bond money, together with matching federal dollars from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, provided the funds necessary for acquiring the restricted zone ? land within 400 to 800 feet on both sides of the waterway. A 2005 attempt at updating the AWW management plan ended in failure primarily because the various parties could not agree on motor vehicle access points and the rebuilding of Henderson Brook Bridge. Legislation codifying motor vehicle access points and permanent bridge crossings, as well as designating the number of snowmobile access points, effectively settled the primary areas of contention. The establishment of the AWW Advisory Council also paved the way for the recently approved plan. The Council?s initial task was to develop a first-ever strategic plan for the waterway. That work, completed in December 2010, followed the guidelines of the founding legislation, which directs the waterway to ?preserve, protect and develop the maximum wilderness character of the watercourse.? That strategic plan, along with related legislation, forms the underpinning of the 2012 AWW management plan. The waterway plan is broken into nine management policy sections with goals, objectives, and strategies under each section. For instance, the plan directs the waterway to eliminate snowmobile access locations at Burntland Brook and Indian Stream and add snowmobile access at Smith Brook and Nugent?s Camps. This maintains the total of 19 snowmobile access locations as directed by statute. The wilderness character of the waterway is to be enhanced by several strategies, including the removal of directional signs that are not absolutely necessary and minimizing signage outside the concentrated use areas. The buildings at Telos Dam are slated for removal and the access road to the dam will be relocated. The parking lot next to the ranger station at Michaud Farm will be closed in favor of a new handicap accessible parking area that will be screened from the river. Some other highlights of the plan are: ? The use of ATVs will be prohibited year-round but could be allowed by special exception when there is lack of snow in the winter by the posting of access trails. ? Three new campsites are to be built next to the Chamberlain parking lot to accommodate late arriving canoe groups. ? Multi-party campsites will be reduced in size or replaced with single party campsites where possible. ? Campsite standards will be developed and sites will not be allowed to fall below a base standard. Remedial action will be taken, such as hardening or relocation when problems are identified. ? Facilities at vehicle access points are to be improved to better accommodate use by persons with disabilities. ? Public information will be enhanced by using web-based tools to help users preview and plan trips to the waterway.

The Governor also took part in honoring the legacy of Russell Libby, who was named the recipient of the Commissioner?s Distinguished Service Award for 2013. Commissioner Whitcomb told a luncheon gathering of 350 that ?for everyone in this room, the words ?organic farming? are synonymous with Russell Libby in the state of Maine.? Mr. Libby, a longtime executive director of the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, passed away in early December, and his family attended the Commissioner?s Luncheon as guests of honor. Governor LePage presented the award to Mary Anne Libby, Russell?s spouse, who was joined on the podium by Ronda Nichols of Stockton Springs, Russell?s sister, and two of his daughters, Anna Libby of Orono and Maisey Libby of Mount Vernon.

In addition to honoring Russell Libby, the Governor also pointed out that our agricultural industry is part of Maine?s heritage and has a huge role to play in making Maine prosperous. ?Ours is a beautiful state,? he said at the luncheon, ?and with our forests, farms and coastline, there is no reason we cannot lead the nation with our thriving natural-resource based economy. We can compete globally with our products thanks to the hard work and innovation from farmers like the ones I see here today.? The Governor and Commissioner Whitcomb also spoke to members of the agriculture community about the success of last year?s merger of the Department of Agriculture and Department of Conservation into one agency, which has already resulted in improved delivery of coordinated services to constituents and increased resources for agricultural programs. ?The additional assets of the now-combined departments give us more resources as we widen our expertise in the continuously growing fields of food and fiber production,? Commissioner Whitcomb said. The Agricultural Trades Show, one of the State?s premier agricultural events, continues on Wednesday and Thursday and offers free admission.

It will move to Wolfe?s Neck in Freeport for four days, February 10-13, with the same hours of operation. ?Many Mainers don?t realize how enjoyable our parks can be over the winter months,? said Walt Whitcomb, Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, which includes Parks and Public Lands. ?Our outstanding state parks get thousands of visitors in the summer, but they have a special appeal in the winter. I?ve been out there on cross-country skis and snowshoes, and there?s nothing like it. These are some of most scenic places in the state.? The ski and snowshoe trailer and its contents were provided by a grant from the Maine Outdoor Heritage Fund, along with sponsorships by L.L. Bean, Wicked Joe Coffee and Healthy Hometowns, a program of the Maine Winter Sports Center. It has 66 pairs of cross-country skis, boots, bindings and poles, and 44 pairs of snowshoes. ?We?re excited to have the trailer coming to Bradbury for the first time,? said park manager Frank Appleby. ?For anyone who has ever wanted to try out cross-country skiing or snowshoeing, but never had the chance, this is a great opportunity. We even provide instruction for beginners.? This is the second year for the trailer, which is making the rounds this winter, stopping at a number of Maine state parks. Under the motto ?Take It Outside,? the Parks and Public Lands Division is encouraging Mainers to enjoy the state?s parks at all times of year. Area residents may also be interested in the Great Maine Outdoors Weekend, set for Range Ponds State Park in Poland. A highlight is the Kids? Ice Fishing Derby, scheduled from 8 a.m. to noon on Monday, February 18, when President?s Day will be observed. The Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife will stock the lake with brook trout, and the first 500 kids that register will receive free ice fishing equipment, compliments of Kittery Trading Post. ### Maine Senior FarmShare Program Preparing for New Season February 6, 2013 For more information contact: Jay Finegan at: 207-287-3156 AUGUSTA ? Maine?s Senior FarmShare program is gearing up for another season. Eligible seniors will once again be able to get free fruit, vegetables and herbs from local Maine farmers. Last year, more than 19,000 seniors and 130 farmers took part in the program, which provides $50 worth of produce to each participant. Qualifying seniors contract directly with local farmers for pickup or delivery. The program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and administered in Maine by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF). Last year, Maine received just over $1 million to operate the program. The allocation for this year has not been finalized, but USDA anticipates receiving about $20 million to run the program nationwide, the same as in 2012. ?Our local farmers are the bread and butter of Maine?s agricultural community,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?This funding will be used to leverage support to promote and support our farmers while helping our most vulnerable citizens.? Application letters are now going out to farmers who took part in the program in the past. ?We?re hoping for another strong participation level, so we can serve people all over the state,? said Julie Waller, the FarmShare program manager at DACF. ?The people in the program, especially folks on fixed incomes, really appreciate the wholesome food the farmers provide.? A survey of last summer?s participants turned up dozens of glowing reviews about the quality of both the food and the service. ?The produce sure helps me get by,? wrote one senior.? I have only 42 percent of my heart, so picking berries is out of the question, but I can go to the farmer and get them.? Another wrote, ?The farm stand where I shopped was very neat and clean. The people were friendly and helpful. I look forward to the next growing season. There is nothing more delicious than a red-ripe tomato from a local farm.? To qualify for a Senior FarmShare, a participant must be a Maine resident, at least 60 years old and with a household income of not more than 185 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines. Last year?s thresholds were $20,665 for singles and $27,991 for a two-person household. DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb said the program has proven to be an asset for farmers and seniors. ?Under our innovative approach, farmers receive the $50 per customer in the spring so the program provides them with working capital for the summer growing season,? he said. ?And it helps ensure that Maine seniors have access to healthy, nourishing food.? Participating farmers offer a variety of methods for providing produce. Seniors pick it up at a specific farmers? market, or at the farm or farm stand. Some farmers offer home delivery. Eligible produce includes fresh, unprocessed fruit, vegetables and herbs. Seniors may contract the Area Agency on Aging at 877-353-3771 to find participating farmers once the list is complete, probably by mid-March. The list also will be available at [http://www.getrealmaine.com/.](http://www.getrealmaine.com/.) # Kids? Ice Fishing Derby Set for Range Ponds State Park, Feb. 18 February 13, 2013 For more information contact: Jay Finegan at: 207-287-3156 AUGUSTA ? The ?Hooked on Fishing? Kids? Derby is set for Range Ponds State Park on Monday, Feb. 18, when the Presidents Day national holiday will be observed. This is the fourth Kids? Derby at the park, located off the Empire Road in Poland. The Derby runs from 8 a.m. to noon, and all that kids have to do is show up and drop a line in the water. Volunteers from the Sebago Lake Rotary will drill fishing holes through the ice early that morning, and other volunteers will be on hand to bait hooks, mostly with small shiners. The event is an introduction to ice fishing, organized for children not familiar with the activity. ?This is a wonderful opportunity to take your kids out for an enjoyable and educational experience,? said Walt Whitcomb, commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF), which includes the Division of Parks and Public Lands. ?Ice fishing is a Maine tradition, and there?s no better way for kids to learn how to ice fish than by doing it.? There is no charge for children 12 and under, and the first 500 who pre-register and arrive at the park by 10 a.m. will receive free ice fishing rigs, courtesy of Kittery Trading Post.

The stocking will take place close to Derby day, and event officials are asking that no ?pre-fishing? take place. ?Even if you do catch and release, it has an impact on how quickly fish will resume feeding,? said Francis Brautigam, a fish biologist with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. The Kids? Derby follows a major ice fishing derby on nearby Sebago Lake on Saturday and Sunday, Feb. 16 and 17, a free fishing weekend. Both events are part of the Great Maine Outdoors Weekend. According to park officials, the recent cold weather should create ideal ice conditions. ### Family Fun Day Set for Aroostook State Park, Feb. 23 February 15, 2013 For more information contact: Jay Finegan at: 207-287-3156 AUGUSTA ? Mainers of all ages are invited to ?Take It Outside? on Saturday, Feb. 23, when Aroostook State Park will come alive with a wide variety of Winter Family Fun Day activities.

Bean ?bootmobile? is slated to be on site during the event. The park is located on Echo Lake, off U.S. Route 1 south of Presque Isle, in the heart of Maine?s potato country. The Winter Family Fun Day is part of the ?Take It Outside? campaign run by the Parks and Public Lands Division of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF). ?Family Fun Days have become very popular wintertime events at our parks,? said Will Harris, director of Parks and Public Lands. ?The idea is to encourage Mainers to get outdoors for recreation, relaxation and health.? DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb noted that Aroostook State Park is the oldest park in the Maine system, dating back to 1938. ?This is a spectacular place, with groomed cross-country ski and snowshoe trails,? he said. ?Folks who come out for a Family Fun Day can enjoy a wide variety of activities and have an opportunity to try something they haven?t done before.? Thanks to the support of sponsors, the event is very affordable. This year?s program, including lunch, is offered for the bargain price of $1.50 for anyone aged 12 to 64. For those over 65 or under 12, everything is free. Park manager Scott Thompson said the park will request a $3 donation for dogsled rides to defray the cost of transporting the dogs and equipment to the park. The ski and snowshoe trailer and its contents were provided by a grant from the Maine Outdoor Heritage Fund, along with sponsorships by L.L. Bean, Wicked Joe Coffee and Healthy Hometowns, a program of the Maine Winter Sports Center. The trailer has 66 pairs of cross-country skis, boots, bindings and poles, and 44 pairs of snowshoes. Local sponsors of the event include Cary Medical Center, Graves supermarket, Katahdin Trust Company, MMG Insurance, TAMC (the Aroostook Medical Center), Haines Manufacturing and TD Bank.

Hunters for the Hungry Program Supported January 7, 2013 LEWISTON ? Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb and representatives from Walmart met today to recognize the contributions of local hunters in support of a program to address hunger in Maine. Walmart employees from the Lewiston area presented Commissioner Whitcomb with a $14,750 check to support the Hunters for the Hungry Program. Thirty-seven Walmart employees from the Lewiston area signed up for the program to hunt deer, bear, and moose and raise money. All told, the volunteers contributed 2,099 hours over a period of months hunting, raising awareness and money for the cause. Their contributions were part of a Walmart Foundation initiative, Volunteerism Always Pays (VAP). Commissioner Whitcomb thanked Walmart employees, and spoke briefly about its importance. ?Walmart?s contribution is symbolic of the type of support this program receives annually from hunters throughout the state. I can?t say enough about the role Maine sportsmen and women play in helping provide nutritious meals to hungry people across Maine. Events like this help build awareness of the great need for additional supporters and contributions that feed Maine families. Every day the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry brings citizens throughout Maine together in so many ways, and this is one of them,? said Whitcomb. The Hunters for the Hungry Program is part of the Department?s Emergency Food Assistance Program. Established in 1996, it has grown steadily and provides thousands of nutritious meals to hungry people across the state. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry distributes donations to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households with a medical need. It is done in cooperation with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife?s wardens, Maine State Troopers and caring hunters, are all working towards a common goal of helping fellow Mainers. The program accepts bear, deer and moose donations. Road kill donations are also accepted, provided the meat is not damaged. Hunters do not pay for the processing of donated meat. Meat processing costs are paid for by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry or the charity that receives the food. Hunters choosing to keep their game can still donate a few pounds to the program.

To promote Maine maple syrup, Governor Paul LePage today joined Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb, Legislators and Maine Maple Producers on the Blaine House lawn for an annual tradition ? the tapping of a maple tree. The Blaine House tapping event also serves as a prelude to Maine Maple Sunday, which is held every year on the fourth Sunday of March. This year, Maine Maple Sunday will celebrate its 30th Anniversary on March 24th at more than 125 sugarhouses throughout Maine. Participating sugarhouses will be open for visitors to participate in syrup and candy sampling, demonstrations of making syrup, sugarbush tours, and a variety of other activities. ?The maple industry has a huge potential for job creation,? said Governor LePage. ?This industry demonstrates the great opportunity Maine has to promote its natural resource-based economy, and promote prosperity for our citizens,? added the Governor. Maine had 1.47 million taps and produced 360,000 gallons of maple syrup in 2011, a 14% increase from 2010. The latest yearly figures show that Maine generated nearly $13 million in revenue from the maple industry. In 2011, Maine was third in the nation producing 13 percent of maple syrup in the United States. Figures for 2012 are not yet available. ?Once again, Governor LePage is showing his support for the important role the maple industry plays in Maine?s economy by kicking off the maple syrup season right here on the Blaine House lawn,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?The maple industry demonstrates how Maine can have multiple uses of its natural resources and how a wood lot has an array of benefits ? maple syrup, wood production, recreation and open space.?

The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Maine Floodplain Management Program urges Mainers to consider purchasing flood insurance. If your home or business is located close to a water body, it might be a good idea to purchase flood insurance in advance of the spring rains. Standard home- and business-owners? insurance policies do not cover flood-related damages. A separate flood insurance policy can be purchased through your local insurance agent. Consumers are urged to act quickly, because there is a 30-day waiting period before any new policy goes into effect unless insurance is being purchased in direct connection with making, increasing, extension, or renewal of a loan. If consumers delay, they may be left without flood coverage when it is needed most. March and April are historically the months when flooding occurs in Maine, but heavy rains can cause flooding any time of the year. It is estimated that up to 75% of homes and businesses in floodplains in Maine are not covered by flood insurance. The average annual premium is $930. As long as the community you reside in participates in the National Flood Insurance Program, flood insurance coverage can be purchased for buildings and their contents no matter where you reside in the community. Property owners interesting in obtaining flood insurance should contact their insurance agency directly. Additional information about the National Flood Insurance Program is available through the Maine Floodplain Management Program by calling 287-8063.

Walt Whitcomb, Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, visited the Farrington Elementary School today to talk about Maine farms and read aloud to fourth graders. The event kicks off National Agriculture Week, which begins March 18. Whitcomb, a dairy farmer himself, read this year?s book, ?Dairy Farming for ME?, to students, then answered questions on a wide range of topics. The Farrington Elementary School fourth graders also learned how to make butter. Students asked Commissioner Whitcomb a number of questions about cows, milk, and nature?s recycling process. When one girl stated, ?It looks like a lot of technology,? Commissioner Whitcomb emphasized how today?s farmers are using technology every day. Whitcomb touched on many of the skills and attributes needed to produce food. ?I was impressed at how inquisitive the kids were about nutrition (human and animal), and how interested they were in learning more about food production,? said Whitcomb. ?Events like this help build interest and awareness and, hopefully, future farmers.? The Commissioner concluded his visit by urging kids to ?go visit a cow someday.? ?Read ME Agriculture? is an annual event sponsored by Maine Agriculture in the Classroom. Volunteers take Ag-related books and materials to grades Pre K ? 4 across the state and volunteer their time reading to the students. This year the book, ?Dairy Farming for ME? was written especially for the event with the help of The Maine Dairy Promotion Board and Maine Dairy Nutrition Council. Additional funding was provided by a grant from USDA and the Maine Agriculture specialty license plate. National Agriculture week begins March 18 and will involve 600 Maine classrooms with more than 12,000 students. Over 180 volunteers will conduct similar reading events across the state in every county.

Commissioner Walt Whitcomb today urged Maine families to visit sugarhouses this Sunday, March 24, as part of Maine Maple Sunday. Maine Maple Sunday will take place at over one hundred sugarhouses across Maine. This annual event, held every fourth Sunday in the month of March, will celebrate its 30-year anniversary this year. Participating sugarhouses will be open for visitors to enjoy freshly made maple syrup and candy, demonstrations of syrup production, sugarbush tours, and a variety of other family activities. Governor Paul R. LePage recently highlighted the start of maple tapping season with Maine Maple producers on the Blaine House lawn by following an annual tradition: the tapping of a maple tree. The Governor used the event to highlight the economic contributions of Maine?s maple syrup industry and its potential to create even more jobs. ?This industry demonstrates the excellent opportunity Maine has to promote its natural resource-based economy, as well as to promote job creation for our citizens,? said Governor LePage. ?The maple industry highlights multiple uses of Maine?s natural resources and how a wood lot has an array of benefits, such as maple syrup, wood production, recreation and open space. It also demonstrates the potential of our newly merged Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry to highlight all aspects of our natural resource industries,? said Commissioner Whitcomb. Commissioner Whitcomb recently presented a bottle of Maine maple syrup to United States Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack during his recent visit to Maine (photo attached).

March 25, 2013 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 AUGUSTA- Maine Forest Rangers urge motor vehicle operators to exercise caution and common sense when traveling on any unpaved areas whether it is on dirt roads, fields, public areas or other open spaces during ?mud season.? ?Unauthorized mudding on roads or private property is not good, clean fun,? said Walt Whitcomb, Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF). ?Making the mud fly is more than likely causing a significant amount of private property, crop or environmental damage.? Maine?s Forest Rangers are a part of the Forest Protection Program within the DACF Division of Forestry. The Rangers also warned that causing mudding damage could be a Class E crime, and they are on the alert to stop damage and catch violators. Widespread public education is the preferred method of Maine Forest Rangers to minimize that damage and protect property owners. Every spring across Maine, forest and agricultural owners have their roads damaged by motor vehicles. The operators of these motor vehicles, usually in four-wheel-drive pickups, look for roads that are muddy and wet in order to slip, slide and spin in mud. As these landowners know, these activities are very costly to repair, can be highly unsightly and can cause lost productivity. Maine?s Forest Rangers investigate numerous complaints of damage to forest lands, crop lands, ATV trails and roads each year and have worked successfully with District Attorneys across the state in numerous prosecutions. As a unit of Maine government charged with protecting the Maine, forest, Rangers urge the pickup drivers to understand that in a very short amount of time, a vehicle operating on wet forest roads or soft crop lands can cause thousands of dollars in damage and can also harm fish habitat with uncontrolled mud runoff. ?Maine?s Forest Rangers are vigilant in protecting our resources,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?I commend them not only for serving as stewards of our environment, but also for keeping Mainers safe. I encourage everyone to enjoy Maine?s outdoors, but ask that they act responsibly and respect private and public property at all times. ? As stated in Maine law, a person who, as a result of operating a motor vehicle on farmland or forest land, damages or destroys crops, forest products, personal property or roads on that farmland or forest land, commits a Class E crime. Further, a ?motor vehicle\" means any self-propelled vehicle not operated exclusively on tracks, including all-terrain vehicles as defined in Title 12, section 13001, but not including snowmobiles. Recently, a driver from Eddington was convicted in Bangor District Court for damaging a road owned by the Bureau of Parks and Lands in Bradley, after he drove on the closed road creating ruts and other damage. The driver was fined $250 for the offense. Along with fines, permanent trespass warnings are sometimes issued to violators, resulting in them being barred from returning to the property. Forest Rangers will be joining all law enforcement over the next few weeks looking for people causing mud season damage with their motor vehicles. Rangers are often in close contact with landowners who have had past problems, in an effort to identify trouble spots and to concentrate patrol efforts. People witnessing roads and crop lands being damaged are asked to call their local law enforcement or the Maine Forest Service at 1-800-750-9777.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Division of Parks and Public Lands is pleased to announce that it is seeking grant proposals to improve recreational boating access to the waters of the State of Maine for fiscal year 2014, which begins July 1, 2013 and ends June 30, 2014. ?With 2,300 great ponds, 32,000 miles of streams and rivers and over 3,000 miles of coastline, the State of Maine offers unparalleled opportunities for recreational boating,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?However, with only 460 assured public recreational boat access sites, we need to do more to ensure the public has adequate access to these waters.? The Maine Legislature established the Boating Facilities Fund in 1963, which is administered by the Division of Parks and Public Lands, Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and is funded with the state tax on gasoline used by recreational motor boats. The Division uses these funds to acquire, develop and renovate recreational boat access sites and to place and maintain navigational buoys on nearly 50 inland lakes and ponds. The Division?s philosophy is that boating access sites are more efficiently managed on the local level and so accomplishes most of its mission of providing boat access through a grant process. Projects are expected to be in the $30,000 to $250,000 range and must be completed by June 30, 2015. A 50% cash or in-kind match is required. Project proposals are due June 26, 2013. A pre-application inspection by Division staff must be completed before an application is submitted. Requests for pre-application inspections must be made no later than May 17, 2013.

The First Time Campers program will randomly select forty-four (44) lucky Maine entrants to win a free weekend of camping this summer at one of eleven (11) Maine state park campgrounds. This raffle is open only to Maine families and individuals who have never before gone camping. Each selected winner will get the free use of camping equipment, receive gifts from sponsors and be supported throughout the weekend by park staff. This year, one of those fortunate winners also will be the grand-prize recipient of a $1,000 gift certificate from the program?s major sponsor, L.L.Bean. ?This program is an exciting opportunity for more Maine families to get outdoors, get active, and experience the joy of camping,? said Maine Governor Paul R. LePage. ?This is another example of how our state parks welcome new visitors.? ?Campgrounds at Maine state parks are located at some of the most beautiful places in Maine. There is no better place to learn to camp.? said Park Manager, Frank Appleby of Bradbury Mountain State Park, who this year is organizing the DPPL program. ?I grew up camping, and I really enjoy sharing my camping experience with Maine families. The winning families will be introduced to the skills and equipment needed to have a comfortable experience in the outdoors. We want to dispel the thought that the outdoors is a scary and uncomfortable place.? The program, part of DPPL?s ?Take It Outside? initiative, is designed to encourage Maine families and individuals to experience the fun and rewards of summer camping at Maine state park campgrounds. This year, the program is sponsored by L.L.Bean, Kittery Trading Post, and Wicked Joe Coffee. ?All the winners need to do is arrive at the park and have fun? Appleby said. ?The camping equipment is provided for their use, we make the campground reservation, and we even show them how to set up their campsite. They quickly learn that they can do this,? he said, about camping. ?They know we are there to help them and by the end of the weekend they have the confidence to do it themselves.? The Park Manager said the First Time Camper program clearly is successful, as many of the participants later make reservations at the state park campgrounds. They also become familiar with the state parks and return for day use. Raffle applications are available on line and at Maine state parks. They will be accepted from April 1 to May 31. The recipients will be chosen in a random drawing held on Tuesday, June 4, with the winners notified the week of June 9. There will be four weekends of camping from which the lucky winners can choose, from the weekend of July 12-14 through the weekend of Aug. 2-4. The state Cove; and Lake St. George, Liberty. Each winning entrant will receive camping equipment they can use for the weekend, plus up to four sleeping bags which they can keep. ?There?s no question we hope the winners continue camping after this weekend.? Appleby said ?We hope that during their First Time Camper weekend that they make great family memories and want to come back again and again?.

Now that wildfire season has started, Maine Forest Rangers are urging people to exercise caution with outdoor fires. Spring conditions have already resulted in nearly a dozen wildfires statewide. The largest wildfire was 4 acres and occurred in Clinton on March 31. It was caused by an escaped debris burn. ?Spring wildfire season has already started, and the recent winds have dried the fine fuels and grasses,? said Walt Whitcomb, Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF). ?Our Forest Rangers are actively reminding people to be careful with all outdoor fires.? This is the time of year that people are anxious to clean up fallen limbs and branches in their yards and want to burn their brush piles. During 2012, fires from machine use and escaped brush piles were the most common cause of wildfires. People intending to burn brush should obtain a burn permit from their local fire department or, if they intend to burn in an unorganized territory, from the Maine Forest Service. ?Maine?s Forest Rangers are vigilant in helping prevent and protect us from forest fires,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?The health of our forest resources is extremely important to our economy and the vitality of our way of life. But we want to make sure we keep all Mainers safe during wildfire season.? Yesterday, to mark the beginning of wildfire season, the cover was taken off of the life-sized Smokey Bear statue at the Maine Information Center in Kittery (mile 4 of the interstate, northbound). The fire prevention bear statue was installed last summer (see attached photo with Commissioner Whitcomb) to remind residents and visitors of Smokey?s message: ?Only you can prevent wildfires.? In certain areas, the Maine Forest Service online burn permit system is available, and burn permits can be purchased for a minimal fee at www.maineburnpermit.com. For more information on how to burn safely, please contact your local forest ranger at 1-800-750-9777 or visit [http://www.maineforestservice.gov](http://www.maineforestservice.gov) For more information about the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Maine Forest Service, go to: [http://www.maine.gov/acf](http://www.maine.gov/acf) Supporting documents Maine Coastal Program previews Coastal Access Guide for boaters and coastal enthusiasts at Maine Boating Expo April 9, 2013 For more information contact: Matt Nixon at: (207) 592-5088 Augusta, Maine - The Maine Coastal Program will preview two exciting new resources at the Maine Boating Expo. The Expo, organized by the Maine Marine Trades Association, will be held at Brunswick Landing (former site of the Brunswick Naval Air Station) from 9 a.m. Friday, April 12 to 4 p.m. Sunday, April 14. The Expo is sponsored by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF). These two resources of special interest to boaters and coastal enthusiasts are the Maine Coastal Access Guide and the preliminary results of The New England Recreational Boating Survey. The Maine Coastal Public Access Guide is a three-volume guidebook detailing more than 700 sites along Maine?s 5,300-mile, world-renowned coastline. The Guide provides geographic coordinates, amenities and facilities, parking and directions, and descriptions of each site. The Southern Maine, Midcoast, and Downeast editions will be released for sale by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry in early summer 2013. ?Coastal lands and waters and recreational boating play a major role in Maine?s economy,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?This new guide recognizes that public access to the shore is vital to the survival of some of Maine?s most significant commercial and recreational enterprises, including fishing, marine transportation, tourism, boating and wildlife viewing.? ?I offer my sincere thanks to the hundreds of partners who helped create the Maine Coastal Public Access Guide,? said Walt Whitcomb, Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. ?When it is completed and released, it will help residents and visitors navigate and enjoy Maine?s unique coastline.? The New England Recreational Boating Survey was conducted in summer, 2012 by SeaPlan, a Boston-based organization, with the assistance of DACF?s Coastal Program. The preliminary survey results show the important economic impact of recreational boating in New England; informative maps of boating activity were also created. The Maine Coastal Program is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, and is supported by an annual grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association at the federal Department of Commerce. The Coastal Program works with a variety of public and private partners like the Maine Marine Trades Association to balance the development and conservation of coastal resources. For more information about the Maine Coastal Program and its work, contact Matthew Nixon at 207-287-1491.

Predators of Hemlock Woolly Adelgid to be released at three Maine State Parks April 10, 2013 For more information contact: Colleen Teerling at: (207) 287-3096 AUGUSTA, Maine ? The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s entomology staff will release more than 1,700 tiny, predator lady beetles at each of three Maine state parks in an effort to manage a highly invasive insect that is moving up the coast of Maine. A total of 5,700 tiny, black lady beetles, known as Sasajiscymnus tsugae, will be released at Vaughan Woods State Park in South Berwick, Ferry Beach State Park in Saco and Wolfe?s Neck Woods State Park in Freeport to fight hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), an invasive insect that kills hemlock trees. The biological-control effort won?t eradicate the infestation, but it should reduce the HWA population at the park, according to Allison Kanoti, forest entomologist, under the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF). ?It?s the best management tool we have in the forest at this time,? Kanoti said. ?This is a long-term solution; results will not be immediate.? Governor Paul R. LePage was quick to support DACF employees working to contain, eradicate and prevent invasive species. ?The public has an important role to play in helping our professionals address the threats posed by invasive species,? said Governor LePage. ?Once they have taken hold, they are very difficult to contain and/or eliminate.? The beetles, which will come from a Pennsylvania lab, have been purchased with funds donated by park supporters including the South Berwick Conservation Commission and federal grants. Forestry staff will release an additional 10,000 beetles through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture?s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Plant Protection and Quarantine program. Those will be split between Cape Elizabeth and Wiscasset on easement protected forestland that cannot be converted to other uses. These beetles are compatible with forest harvesting, but not with the intensive human activity that can be associated with settled areas. Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) is a small, aphid-like insect that is covered with white, waxy wool-like material. This wool-like covering makes the insect resemble miniature cotton balls. It is most visible from late-October through July, with woolly masses located on the undersides of the twigs at the bases of the needles. The insect begins its egg-laying in March. The insect, which came from Japan in the 1950s, causes deterioration of infested trees, including loss of needles, crown thinning and tree death. The aesthetics and ecology of the affected state parks are threatened by this invasive insect. Hemlock trees, which are susceptible, are an important forest tree at all three locations. Hemlock trees are a significant Maine tree species. Their presence along water bodies helps protect the forest floor from erosion and buffers water temperatures, which can affect such species as brook trout. Hemlocks also are important in deer wintering areas, are a favored landscape tree and contribute to the state?s forest products sector. HWA has been found in at least 18 states. In Maine forest trees, it was first discovered in Kittery in 2003. It has spread and now has been found as far up the coast as Bristol. HWA was first found in Ferry Beach State park by park ranger Janet Mangion in 2008 during routine maintenance operations. It was discovered at Vaughan Woods in December 2010 by a volunteer. The infestation at Wolfe?s Neck Woods was found by forestry staff as part of their annual detection survey in 2010.

Greenhouses, nurseries and garden centers statewide will be celebrating on Saturday, May 4 as the industry kicks off Maine Greenhouse and Nursery Day. For the fourth year, several dozen family-owned businesses will hold special events to highlight the fun and joy of gardening in Maine. Planned activities for the events include giveaways, door prizes, raffles, plants and balloons for children, container-planting demonstrations, personal tours, expert speakers and mini workshops. Participating greenhouses and nurseries also will preview spring introductions and share their expertise by offering gardening tips, information on plant varieties and ideas for window box and landscape design. ?Greenhouse and Nursery Day helps highlight the importance of horticulture to Maine?s economy,? Governor Paul R. LePage said. ?In addition to providing thousands of jobs, the horticulture industry contributes over $280 million annually to Maine?s economy.? ?More than half of the plants sold in Maine are grown right here, and our greenhouses and nurseries work hard to promote the sale of their product locally,? said Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?I encourage Mainers to take advantage of this opportunity to visit their local garden centers on May 4 and enjoy the wonderful fun and educational events being offered.? The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry licenses and inspects more than 1,307 businesses selling plants in Maine. The Department also certifies plant exports, regulates imported plants and assists growers with plant pest problems. Maine Greenhouse and Nursery Day is supported by the Ornamental Horticulture Council and the Mid-Maine Greenhouse Growers Association.

Maine?s Departments of Environmental Protection and Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry are helping farmers who want to do their part to protect water quality by releasing $3 million for agriculture improvements loans. The two State departments, in partnership with the Finance Authority of Maine (FAME) and the Maine Municipal Bond Bank, have expanded the Nutrient Management Loan Program, developed to fund construction of containment and handling facilities for milk room and manure waste. Since its inception in 1999, that program has made 14 loans totaling $1.3 million. The DEP-administered Clean Water State Revolving Fund will provide up to $3 million for FAME to finance the loans with farmers able to borrow up to $450,000 at a fixed interest rate of 2 percent for up to 20 years. ?Agriculture is a $1.5 billion industry in Maine, and the thousands of people who work in it have the important responsibility of stewarding 1.25 million acres,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?I thank these two agencies for coming together with FAME and the bond bank to increase the sustainability of Maine farms and our state. This expanded loan program is good news for our natural resources and for our economy.? Loans will fund agricultural projects that mitigate nonpoint source pollution by reducing or treating agricultural runoff and improving or maintaining water quality through irrigation system improvements and the use of irrigation reservoirs to maintain in-stream flows and water levels. Eligible improvement projects include repairs to or installation of roof runoff structures, water and sediment control basins, composting facilities, anaerobic digesters and irrigation system water conservation. DACF will review the proposed projects for eligibility and to ensure they are completed in accordance with USDA?s Natural Resources Conservation Services design criteria. ?Maine?s farmers know firsthand the great value of clean water and the importance of minimizing agricultural runoff,? said DEP Commissioner Patricia W. Aho. ?Thanks to our increased funding commitment, these important partners in protection will be able to better steward the land and water they depend on for their livelihood while investing in the future of the farms that feed Maine people and our economy.? ?These loan opportunities will lead to investments in agricultural infrastructure,? added DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Long-term agricultural viability protects Maine water resources.? Since 1989, the Maine Clean Water State Revolving Fund has provided over $650 million in low-interest loans for projects that improve water quality and protect environmental and public health, largely to publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities.

The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Division of Parks and Public Lands reports that the ice is out on most of the headwater lakes in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway. Waterway Superintendent Matt LaRoche reports: Telos, Chamberlain, Eagle, Churchill, Umsaskis and Long Lakes are all free of ice. Allagash Lake is still iced in, but should be out by this weekend. ?Ice out is an exciting time of the year in Maine,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?On the waterway, it is the symbol of a change in seasons. Our dedicated staff has been working hard to make sure campsites and other facilities are fire safe, clean and free of hazards.? Early spring is traditionally the best fishing of the year on the waterway. ?Lunker trout are a little easier to catch right after the ice goes out. The trout will be feeding heavily on spawning smelt as they congregate near tributaries streams,? said Waterway Superintendent Matt LaRoche. Waterway Rangers urge all visitors to wear their life jackets when on the water. The Allagash Wilderness Waterway (AWW) is Maine?s magnificent, 92-mile-long ribbon of lakes, ponds, rivers and streams that runs through the heart of Maine?s vast commercial forest. The AWW was established in 1966 by the Maine Legislature to protect and develop the maximum wilderness character of the waterway. This unique area is managed by the Maine Division of Parks and Public Lands under the Maine Department of Agriculture Conservation and Forestry. In 1970, the AWW was named the first state-administered component of the National Wild and Scenic River System. For information on the waterway, call the Division of Parks and Public Lands Bangor regional office at 207-941-4014.

State officials expressed concern even as they took steps to implement a comprehensive, statewide survey effort and enlist public support in helping locate the Emerald Ash Borer (EAB), an invasive insect that destroys ash trees. This year?s survey has taken on greater urgency because the elusive insect has been detected in neighboring New Hampshire, a mere thirty-two (32) miles from the Maine border. ?We must do everything we can to stop this damaging insect,? Maine Governor Paul R. LePage said. ?The Emerald Ash Borer has already destroyed between 50-100 million ash trees in other parts of the country. If it takes hold in Maine, it will negatively impact the vitality of our forests and efforts to grow our natural resource economy.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb echoed the Governor?s concerns and expressed confidence in his Department?s combined, collaborative approach to locating the insect as soon as possible. ?Our foresters, entomologists and plant health experts have put together a comprehensive survey to catch the very first EABs to invade Maine. We are hopeful none enter this season. We are also calling upon the public to help us in this effort,? said Whitcomb. 2013 Emerald Ash Borer Survey: Maine?s 2013 National Cooperative Emerald Ash Borer Survey starts this month. It is a collaboration of federal, state and tribal agencies, with funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It is also part of a national survey effort taking place in 44 states. In Maine, it is a combined effort between the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service; Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry; and the Penobscot Nation Department of Natural Resources. Because of the insect?s potential adverse impact on Maine, the survey is also supported by numerous private businesses and landowners. Purple Traps - Starting this month, close to 875 distinctive, purple bug traps will be placed high up in the canopy of local ash trees at specified locations to see if the emerald ash borer (EAB) is present in Maine. The sites include trees at private businesses and lands, state parks, and campgrounds. Traps will be placed in high-risk zones based on their distance from known infested areas in other states, presence of ash trees, and proximity to travel routes. The purple traps (EAB is attracted to purple) will be monitored in July and then again in September, when they will be removed. The analysis of the traps? contents should be completed by December, according to state entomologists. In addition to the purple traps that are utilized as part of the survey, Maine uses a number of other methods to detect the EAB. These other methods include: Detection Trees ? This method involves sacrificing a particular tree by removing a section of its bark. Egg-laying Emerald Ash Borer adults are highly attracted to weakened trees. If EABs are in the area, they usually can be found on these trees. Biosurveillance ? A native, non-stinging species of wasp is also being utilized to help locate the Emerald Ash Borer. This ground-dwelling wasp is highly adept at hunting the same family of beetles. Surveyors check these wasp nests for the bodies of EABs. Outreach ? All survey methods are important, but the DACF is actively working with the public through outreach and collaboration. The importance of this part of the effort cannot be overstated. Public awareness and support can make the difference, especially to help monitor areas that are not covered by official survey methods. In neighboring New Hampshire, the Emerald Ash Borer?s presence was discovered because a private citizen noticed a suspiciously symptomatic tree and reported it to state authorities.

Supporting documents Parasitic Flies to the Rescue May 7, 2013 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 Release of biocontrol agent designed to combat the winter moth AUGUSTA ? Starting Tuesday, state entomologists from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s (DACF) division of forestry will be releasing parasitic flies in an effort to try and control and minimize the damage to trees and shrubs done by the Winter Moth. The release is being conducted by Dr. Joseph Elkinton, University of Massachusetts Professor of Entomology. He is releasing parasitic flies, Cyzenis albicans, in conjunction with the DACF?s division of forestry. ?This is a long-term approach to limiting the damage caused by the winter moth,? Maine Governor Paul R. LePage said. ?It is important that we protect our natural resource economy from invasive pests like the winter moth, which can also damage blueberry, apple and cranberry crops.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb highlighted the collaborative approach being taken between Maine and Massachusetts. ?We thank Dr. Elkington and the University of Massachusetts for collaborating with us on the timely release of these flies,? said Whitcomb. The winter moth is the latest invasive insect to attack Maine forests with defoliation in Harpswell in 2012. A citizen supported survey of winter moth in December indicated winter moth could be found from Kittery to Bar Harbor. Unlike some of the other invasive insects on our doorstep, this one has a potential biocontrol agent that can hopefully control the insects spread and limit future damage. Beginning Tuesday, parasitic flies, Cyzenis albicans, will be released at two release sites in Harpswell and Cape Elizabeth. Flies will be released again later in the week on either Thursday or Friday. A total of 800 flies will be released at each site with 400 flies released on each day. People frequently ask, ?Will the flies bother anything else (like people)?? The answer is no. These flies were released in Nova Scotia in the 1960s, brought the winter moth population under control and there have been no adverse effects in the intervening 50 years. Flies were also released in British Columbia again with no impacts on other insects or people. The flies are very closely tied to the winter moth life cycle and need winter moth to survive. There will always be some winter moth around, now that they have become established in Maine, but hopefully the flies will do their job and bring the winter moth population under control in a few years. It take years before Maine will see the results of the biocontrol effort, as it takes time for the flies to become acclimated to a new location and build up their population. Once their numbers reach a high enough level, it will have a noticeable impact on the winter moth population. In the meantime people will see defoliation on hardwood trees and shrubs in May. It is hoped trees will not be too adversely effected before the parasite fly population catches up to the winter moth population and brings them into balance in Maine.

Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb highlighted the success of the Maine State Parks Passport project and its ability to promote new connections with visitors to Maine State Parks. ?If your interest, like mine, is to see all our State Parks, the Passport project allows visitors to collect stamps at up to 48 State Parks and historic sites and receive rewards,? said Whitcomb. ?Adding Geocaching (and a contest) to this project further enhances the quality of the experience. Exploring Maine has never been more fun.? Background information of the Passport Program: The Maine State Parks Passport is a collaborative project that was conceived in 2010 by the Maine Division of Parks and Public Lands to commemorate Maine State Parks 75th anniversary as fun way to encourage more people to visit Maine state parks and historic sites. The project involves giving children and adults a ?parks passport? free of charge, available at participating parks and historic sites. This year, 40,000 have been printed for distribution with help from the various sponsors and at no additional cost to the state. There are 12 partners and sponsors, including the DPPL. The passport contains a descriptive page for each of Maine?s 48 state parks and historic sites, with sections for a stamp, plus additional information about the Maine state parks system and the passport sponsors. Passport participants go to each state park, open the passport station and then stamp their passports with a distinctive stamp for each park. As they accumulate stamps, participants can win park-related prizes, such as a park patch and a water bottle up to a free season vehicle pass for completing the passport.

The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry has the good fortune to work with members of the maple industry on important events such as Maine Maple Sunday, the Governor?s Maple Tapping event at the Blaine House, and of course Maple Mania. Governor Paul R. LePage?s support at the Blaine House Tree Tapping event last March really set the stage for a successful year.? In a prepared statement, Governor Paul R. LePage highlighted the economic impact that the Maine maple syrup industry has on Maine?s economy and its potential for future growth. ?This industry demonstrates the excellent opportunity Maine has to promote its natural resource-based economy, as well as to promote job creation for our citizens,? said Governor LePage. ?I applaud their efforts and wish them great success in growing this industry.? This past season, Maine produced 450,000 gallons of maple syrup, a 20% increase over 2011. The latest yearly figures show that Maine generated nearly $13 million in revenue from the maple industry. Maine was third in the nation, producing 14 percent of maple syrup in the United States. Maple Mania History: Maple Mania was created by the Maine Maple Producers Association Board, who recognized a need for more education. Attendance has grown each year, to approximately 150 attendees. In the first year there was a mixture of small and medium size producers and there were 80 attendees in the Central Maine area. Last year the number increased to 110 with smaller producers and bigger marketing producers who attended the event in Westbrook.

Thatchers are Adding a Roof to a Historic Replica Building at Colonial Pemaquid June 21, 2013 For more information contact: Barry Masterson at: 207-677-2423 Bristol, Maine -- It is nearly a lost art. Colonial fishermen and early settlers to this region wove marsh grasses and native reeds into surprisingly sturdy and durable roofs to protect their homes from the sometimes harsh Maine coastal weather. For the next week or so, this craft will again be plied at Colonial Pemaquid State Historic Site as professional roof thatcher Colin McGhee installs a thatched roof on the top of a replica of a 1600s dwelling at the site. The dwelling project has so far been a two year project of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Bureau of Parks and Lands and their partners, the Friends of Colonial Pemaquid. The structure is made of a timber frame with walls made of a mud and stick material known as ?wattle and daub.? The exterior of the building is clad with rough clapboards and the new thatched roof will literally top it all off. The thatching is done by hand by Scotland native Colin McGhee whose work can be seen at his Web site: www.thatching.com. Colonial Pemaquid is situated at the mouth of the Pemaquid River in Bristol. Members of the media are invited to see the work in progress and discuss the art of thatching with McGhee at the historic site on Sunday and Monday, June 23-24, 2013.

Produce growers and packers can learn more about the federal government?s proposed food safety rule at a listening session August 19th at the Augusta State Armory. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) passed in January 2011 represents the most comprehensive reform of food regulation in more than 70 years. A key component of the FSMA is a mandate to shift food safety efforts from reaction to prevention. Individuals will have the opportunity to ask questions about the Produce Safety Rule during the session, which will take place from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. ?The produce safety rule will mean big changes for Maine produce growers and packers,? said Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry Commissioner Walter Whitcomb, who will be the meeting?s host. ?This is an important opportunity to hear from the Food and Drug Administration and offer comments.? The Act directs the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to establish science-based standards for the safe production and harvesting of raw agricultural commodities. In response to this directive, FDA developed a proposed rule known as the Produce Safety Rule which focuses on measures that produce farmers and packers should take to prevent the contamination of fresh fruits and vegetables. The rule proposes five sets of standards designed to address significant routes of microbial contamination of produce. The five sets of standards are: (1) agricultural water; (2) biological soil amendments; (3) employee health and hygiene; (4) animal intrusion into growing areas; and (5) equipment, tools and buildings. On January 4, 2013, the FDA released the proposed rule for public comment. The agency has been strongly encouraged by most of the New England Congressional members, including Maine?s delegation, to hold listening sessions such as this to hear from more farmers. At the meeting, Michael Taylor, FDA?s Deputy Commissioner for Foods & Veterinary Medicine, will present information about the rule. State Agriculture Departments will be active partners in implementing food and safety programs to help growers comply with the new rules. More detailed information regarding the August 19th listening session agenda will soon be available. Questions about the event can be answered by contacting the Department?s Quality Assurance and Regulations Division at (207)287-3841. For those not able not attend the listening session, comments can be made directly to the FDA at www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FSMA/ucm261689 Archaelogical Dig at Colonial Pemaquid July 23, 2013 For more information contact: Tom Desjardin, Historian at: 207-677-2423 The annual archaeological dig at Colonial Pemaquid State Historic Site will take place from Monday, July 22 through Friday, July 26 at the site in Bristol, Maine. Professional archaeologists will begin excavating the enlisted men?s quarters from two seventeenth century forts on the grounds. The officers? quarters of these forts were fully excavated in the 1970s but the enlisted quarters have never been explored. Retired State Archaeologist Leon ?Lee? Cranmer is the principal archaeologist for the dig. Members of the media are invited to visit the site, see the latest discoveries, and speak with the archaeologists on Thursday afternoon, July 25th from 1:00pm on. The first day of the dig yielded a foundation wall along with coins, buttons, a cannon ball, a trunk lock and other items. The dig is sponsored by the Friends of Colonial Pemaquid [http://www.friendsofcolonialpemaquid.org/](http://www.friendsofcolonialpemaquid.org/) Colonial Pemaquid State Historic Site is at the location of a 1600s village, fishing station and the site of three different forts from that time period.

Maine farmers could see their liming agent costs reduced and their profitability increase as a result of an alternative liming agent that is being made available by the Dragon Products Company. Representatives from Dragon Products and the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) are seeking to make farmers aware of the availability of K-Lime for use as an agricultural liming agent. ?This opportunity has the potential to lower production costs for farmers and increase their profitability. I commend Dragon Cement and Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry experts for promoting its availability and seeking ways to strengthen businesses,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb was equally enthusiastic. ?The DACF continues to work with Maine businesses to try to pursue strategies that lower costs, improve efficiencies and strengthen our natural resource-based economy. Our staff worked with Dragon Cement to identify and publicize an opportunity that can benefit local farms and Dragon Cement,? said Whitcomb. ?It?s a win-win situation for Dragon and local farmers. I?m glad we?ve been able to work with the Maine Dept. of Agriculture to make the availability of this product more widely known,? said Raymond DeGrass, Plant Manager for Dragon Products. What is K-Lime: K-Lime is a by-product of portland cement manufacturing. As a partially calcined material, it contains activated calcium compounds having higher solubility than ground limestone. K-Lime provides rapid acid neutralization from highly soluble calcium compounds. It can also provide long-term acid neutralization from calcium and magnesium carbonates. As such, it is suitable as an agricultural liming agent, and for compost and soil blending. K-Lime provides alkalinity to the soil that is needed to maintain optimal pH levels. The enriched levels of potassium and sulfur contained in the product are valuable plant nutrients that are often deficient in soils. Transportation: K-Lime for beneficial and agronomic use is distributed in bulk as is from the Dragon cement manufacturing facility in Thomaston, Maine. Customers seeking K-Lime should contact Dragon prior to pickup at (207) 593-0100.

Many participants expand their retail or wholesale businesses, creating even more jobs in our rural economy,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb highlighted the importance of farmers? markets for farmers, consumers, and entire communities. ?Communities are recognizing the value of assisting markets in their towns and supporting agricultural activity in their immediate and surrounding area,? said Whitcomb. ?The recent growth of farmers? markets, locally and nationally, has been good for both farmers and consumers. For many people living in more populated areas, identifying the farmer, or farm source of their food is important.? Maine?s DACF promotes growth and sustainability of farmers markets: There are currently between 109-120 farmers? markets in Maine. The number in 2012 was approximately 100, up from 63 recorded markets in 2007. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) supports and promotes the growth of farmers markets as a means of connecting local consumers and Maine food and farm products.

Taylor, FDA Deputy Commissioner for Foods & Veterinary Medicine, and others (SEE BELOW). ?The proposed produce safety rule will change product handling procedures for certain Maine fresh fruit and vegetable growers and packers,? said Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry Commissioner Walter Whitcomb, who will be the meeting?s host. ?This is an important opportunity to hear from key individuals from with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration who are preparing federal rules and for Maine farmers to offer comments.? The Act directs the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to establish science-based standards for the safe production and harvesting of raw agricultural commodities. In response to this directive, FDA developed a proposed rule known as the Produce Safety Rule which focuses on measures that produce farmers and packers should take to prevent the contamination of fresh fruits and vegetables. The rule proposes five sets of standards designed to address significant routes of microbial contamination of produce. The five sets of standards are: (1) agricultural water; (2) biological soil amendments; (3) employee health and hygiene; (4) animal intrusion into growing areas; and (5) equipment, tools and buildings. On January 4, 2013, the FDA released the proposed rule for public comment. The agency has been strongly encouraged by most of the New England Congressional members, including Maine?s delegation, to hold listening sessions such as this to hear from more farmers. At the meeting, Michael Taylor, FDA?s Deputy Commissioner for Foods & Veterinary Medicine, will present information about the rule. State Agriculture Departments will be active partners in implementing food and safety programs to help growers comply with the new rules. Questions about the event can be answered by contacting Ellis Additon at (207) 287-7574. For those not able not attend the listening session, comments can be made directly to the FDA at: [http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FSMA/ucm261689](http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/FSMA/ucm261689) AGENDA: Maine Listening Session on Proposed Produce Rule Augusta Armory August 19, 2013 9:30 a.m. Welcome/Opening Remarks - Walt Whitcomb Maine Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 9:40 a.m. - Remarks by Members of Maine?s Congressional Delegation 9:50 a.m. - Opening Remarks - Michael R.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry?s Division of Parks and Public Lands will hold a public meeting on September 11, 2013 to seek public input on a multi-year initiative to enhance non-motorized trails in the Moosehead Lake Region. The public is invited to participate in this meeting, learn about planning that has been done to date, and share ideas on how to enhance non-motorized trails in the region. Time and Place: ? 6:00-8:00 p.m., Wednesday, September 11, Greenville Town Office, 7 Minden St. Greenville. The trail development and enhancement concepts being explored are made possible by funding and easement donations from Plum Creek, who is a partner in the initiative. As directed by the Moosehead Lake Region Concept Plan (approved by the Maine Land Use Planning Commission), one-hundred and twenty-one acres of trail easement may be located on Plum Creek?s 363,000-acre Moosehead Region Conservation Easement. Furthermore, one million dollars will be available to support trail planning, creation, and improvement on the easement lands and on Parks and Lands properties or interests in the Moosehead Lake Region. Five trailhead locations will be donated to the Division of Parks and Public Lands. Trail enhancements will be implemented over a five-year period, with construction beginning in 2014. The exact types and locations of trails to be included in this initiative are to be determined during the planning phase; which includes the September 11 public meeting. The Concept Plan Trail Easement and Implementation Agreement serve as the foundations of the initiative and both limit trail projects to primitive, non-motorized trails available to the public. A range of non-motorized trails ranging from easy walking paths to strenuous backpacking circuits are candidates for development or improvement. Hiking, mountain biking, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, canoe/kayak portaging, and wildlife/environmental observation are all potential trail activities targeted through this effort.

Volunteers Wanted for Landowner Appreciation Cleanup Day, Saturday, September 14 September 6, 2013 For more information contact: Jeff Currier at: 207-441-2580 AUGUSTA- Landowner Appreciation Cleanup Day is September 14. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Division of Forestry is seeking volunteers for this year?s effort. Forest Rangers working in cooperation with the Small Woodland Owners Association of Maine (SWOAM), Maine Snowmobile Association (MSA), ATV Maine, the Boy Scouts of America and the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (IFW), as well as other recreational groups, are seeking to clean up more than 100 illegal dump sites in Maine. In other parts of the country, most undeveloped forest land is posted, and recreationists are required to pay club fees to use locations. Maine landowners have a history of sharing their forest and farm lands with responsible outdoor recreationalists. Millions of acres of working farms and forests are open to the public for enjoyment throughout the year. Unfortunately, the Maine privilege of enjoying access to private lands is threatened every time irresponsible people litter or illegally dump trash. ?Landowner Appreciation Cleanup Day is a way to say thank you to property owners for allowing Mainers and visitors access to private lands for outdoor activities, recreation and enjoyment,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Efforts like this demonstrate that most Maine people understand that public access to private lands is a special privilege to be respected and cherished, not a right.? Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb urged outdoor enthusiasts and organizations to support the effort by volunteering their time and energy. ?Department staff and our partner organizations have worked hard to make this annual effort a success,? he said. ?It is also symbolic of efforts made throughout the year by people and individuals to help ensure future access to private lands by keeping them clear of trash and debris. The goal is to avoid the posting of ?no trespassing? signs and the installation of gates that block access to outdoor recreation.? The Forestry staff, in cooperation with other state agencies and outdoor recreational groups, has been working with landowners to identify specific dump locations and enter them into a database to track progress on site cleanup. It will supply trucks and trash bags for the cleanup effort, but needs volunteers to help load the items. Dump sites vary from a single piece of discarded furniture, a washing machine or discarded tires to several pickup-truck loads of shingles and mattresses. To make it easier for cleanup volunteers, dozens of maps have been created that show the exact dump site locations. Cleanup volunteers who live near an illegal dump site may have to spend only a half hour or less to help clean it up. To volunteer for this project, please contact Jeff Currier at (207) 827-1800, or the Maine Forest Service at 1-800-750-9777. Community Forestry Grants Available September 12, 2013 For more information contact: Jan Ames Santerre at: 207-287-4987 AUGUSTA, Maine ? Project Canopy, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s community forestry program, will award $100,000 in grants to local governments and municipalities, educational institutions and non-profit organizations that support community efforts to develop and maintain long-term community forestry programs. Funded by the U.S. Forest Service, the Project Canopy grants are available in two categories: planning and education grants and tree planting and maintenance grants. The average grants range from $6,000 to $8,000 and require a 50-percent cost-share with cash or in-kind services. Since 2003, Project Canopy has awarded more than $1.4 million in funding for community forestry projects. ?This partnership increases community awareness of the benefits of our forests and trees and promotes sustainable community forest management practices,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Project Canopy also supports Maine jobs by benefiting local landscapers, nurseries, foresters and loggers.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb also highlighted the economic impact of this segment of the Maine economy and the supportive role of Project Canopy grants. ?Maine?s horticulture indutry has a total economic impact of $286 million annually, and the industry supports 7,826 jobs,? said Whitcomb. ?Partnerships like Project Canopy support and enhance jobs in this growing segment of Maine?s economy and overall economic growth.? Project Canopy is a cooperative partnership between the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry?s Division of Forestry and GrowSmart Maine. It encourages communities to develop project proposals that support sustainable community forestry management, increase awareness of the benefits of trees and forests, and increase the health and livability of communities through sound tree planting and maintenance. Project Canopy Director Jan Ames Santerre provided recent examples of community projects that can benefit from Project Canopy grants. Projects of note in 2012 include a grant of $8,100 to the Town of Yarmouth for a shade tree inventory and management plan for street trees, and two projects in Kittery ($8,000) and Brownville ($7,961) that allowed those towns to plant trees in gateway and park areas. ?In addition to helping communities with general maintenance planning, these grants allow them to respond to threats from invasive pests such as the emerald ash borer. They can also support community beautification through street tree planting,? said Santerre. The planning and education grants have a maximum award of $10,000, while the planting and maintenance grants have a maximum award of $8,000. To be eligible to apply for a 2013 assistance grant, all applicants must attend a grant workshop before submitting an application. Grant workshops will be scheduled in September and October at various locations around the state.

This October, the Maine Board of Pesticides Control (BPC) will team up with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to dispose of banned pesticides or pesticides that have become caked, frozen, or otherwise rendered unusable. This free disposal program is open to homeowners, family-owned farms and greenhouses. All people need to do is register by September 27, 2013. It?s not unusual for homes and farms to have unintentional hazardous waste?old or unusable pesticides sitting around in basements, garages, or barns. Old chemicals like DDT, lead arsenate, 2,4,5-T, and chlordane, can be difficult and expensive to dispose of properly. While removal of these pesticides can seem daunting, it?s important for the protection of public, wildlife, and environmental health that they are dealt with properly and not thrown in the trash or down the drain, where they can contaminate land and water resources, including drinking water. ?We urge people holding these chemicals to contact us immediately to register,? said BPC Director, Henry Jennings. ?There will be four sites throughout the state where participants will be able to bring their obsolete pesticides and dispose of them conveniently and at no cost.? The collected chemicals go to out-of-state disposal facilities licensed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency where they are incinerated or reprocessed. - Registration by September 27, 2013, is mandatory?drop-ins are not permitted. To register, get details, and learn important information about the temporary storage and transportation of obsolete pesticides, go to the BPC Web site at [http://www.thinkfirstspraylast.org](http://www.thinkfirstspraylast.org)or call 207-287-2731. The Maine Obsolete Pesticides Collection Program, jointly sponsored by the BPC and DEP, and paid for entirely through pesticide product registration fees, has kept more than 90 tons of pesticides out of the waste stream since its start in 1982.

With hunting season underway, Governor Paul R. LePage urges Maine hunters to consider supporting the Hunters for the Hungry Program by donating all or part of their harvest to feed families in need. The popular program provides a means for hunters in Maine, as well as other states, to donate to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households with a medical need. ?The Hunters for the Hungry Program is a way that Maine hunters can pursue a sport they love and help their neighbors at the same time,? said Governor LePage. ?The fact that this program has grown so steadily is both a testament to the need and the generosity of Mainers.?. Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb noted that since its establishment in 1996, the Hunters for the Hungry Program has grown steadily and provided thousands of nutritious meals to hungry people across the state. ?I can?t say enough about the role Maine sportsmen and women play in helping provide nutritious meals to hungry people across Maine. The Department is working to help build awareness of the great need for additional supporters and contributions that feed Maine families. Every day the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry brings citizens throughout Maine together in so many ways, and this is one of them,? said Whitcomb. The Hunters for the Hungry Program is part of the Department?s Emergency Food Assistance Program. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry distributes donations to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households with a medical need. It is done in cooperation with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife?s wardens, Maine State Troopers and caring hunters, are all working towards a common goal of helping fellow Mainers.

Maine decorative-plant shippers who are sending Christmas trees and wreaths around the country for the holiday season can save money and lost products by noting important regulations enforced by other states, according to the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF). The Department promotes and assists natural resource-based Maine businesses, and is seeking to help educate shippers and spread the word in advance of the holiday season. ?Shippers should be especially aware this year of the many state laws and regulations regarding the movement of plants and forest products,? warned Ann Gibbs, Maine state horticulturist. ?Many states, including Maine, closely monitor shipments to prevent infestation by invasive insects and the spread of plant diseases. Planning ahead benefits Maine shippers by speeding along deliveries in this time-sensitive industry,? said Gibbs. DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb stressed the importance of working to educate shippers in advance of the holidays to avoid or reduce shipping delays. ?Governor Paul R. LePage has made support for natural resource job creators a hallmark of his administration. Maine forests have contributed to the holiday spirit across America for generations. The DACF supports and enhances that tradition and further development of Maine?s natural resource economy,? said Whitcomb. DACF staff offer wreath and tree shippers the following advice: - Check out-of-state orders in advance, especially those headed to California, to make sure they don?t have insect damage on the needles. - Import regulations can vary from state to state, shippers should check them out beforehand. - Distributors should identify their products clearly through labeling, beginning with the statement, ?Grown in Maine,? followed by the county of origin and the name and address of the shipper. - Labels should indicate the contents of packages, including the different types of greenery, nuts, fruits and cones used to decorate wreaths. ?Import requirements for cut trees, wreaths with ornamental nuts and fruit arrangements exist to protect regional agriculture or other commodities from the risk of plant pests,? Gibbs explained. Unfortunately, despite the quality of Maine products, some shippers have learned about these regulations the hard way and have had shipments delayed, impounded and occasionally destroyed. We want to prevent any losses by getting the word out now,? said Gibbs.

Administered by the DACF?s Maine Coastal Program, the awards will provide support for coastal habitat restoration, coastal hazards resilience, and invasive species removal. The grants are made possible from Maine?s federal coastal management award from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The grant program is an important component of the DACF Coastal Program work program, which includes coastal regional and local planning elements administered through the DACF Municipal Planning and Assistance Program. All of the projects include collaboration and partnerships and each grantee will provide a minimum of 25% in matching funds or services. ?The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry is a partner with many communities in their local mitigation efforts,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Our Maine Coastal Program Grants help communities address natural resource concerns including habitat restoration, storm surge, and, in the case of the Brunswick project, the threat invasive green crabs pose to commercial fisheries.? Grants were awarded as follows: 1 City of Augusta: $15,863 for the Final Design of Restoring a Historical Alewife Run of Significance to the Lower Kennebec in partnership with the Worromontogus Lake Association, Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment, Maine Department of Marine Resources and the NOAA Restoration Center. The project will re-establish alewife access to the Togus Stream lake system upstream of the Lower Togus Pond Dam. Construction of a fishway at the dam ranks as one of the highest priority fish passage projects in the Lower Kennebec Watershed. This grant will fund the engineering to position the project for construction. Work will include volunteer fish passage counts, environmental monitoring, fishway engineering designs and permitting for the construction phase of the project. 2 Town of Bristol: $14,250 for Citizen Science and Engineering to Plan the Restoration of Pemaquid River Alewife in partnership with the Bristol Fish Committee, Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment, Maine DMR, and NOAA Restoration Center. The project will reestablish unhindered alewife access through the Bristol Mills Dam Fishway and into the Pemaquid River chain of lakes. The large amount of upstream habitat blocked by the dam makes this project one of highest priority alewife restoration efforts in Maine. This project will include volunteers engaged as citizen scientists. This grant will provide funds for engineering designs and regulatory permitting for improvements to the fishway. 3 Town of Brunswick $38,625 for a Community Project to Remove Invasive European Green crabs from Buttermilk and Woodward Coves in partnership with Brunswick High School Office of Service Learning and Community Outreach and Resource Access International Municipal government, private sector scientists, commercial shellfish harvesters, and local students will partner to deploy predator fencing and traps in Buttermilk and Woodward Coves in Brunswick, with the goal of reducing the numbers of invasive European green crabs in these critical habitat areas. European green crab destruction of intertidal areas in Brunswick is impacting important wading bird and finfish/shellfish nursery habitat, as well as destroying commercially valuable native shellfish species. Economic impacts on the coastal community are imminent as a result of green crab damage This project will help determine the feasibility of reducing green crab numbers in sheltered coves along the Maine coast. 4 Town of Woolwich: $30,262 for Nequasset Fishway Construction Material In partnership with the Kennebec Estuary Land Trust, Woolwich Fish Commission, and Bath Water Commission This community supported habitat restoration project is the final step to rebuild a 58 year old concrete pool and weir style fish ladder on one of the top alewife runs in Maine. Award of this proposal will close the funding gap by paying for building materials, ensuring summer 2014 construction of a new fish ladder at Nequasset Brook in Woolwich. 5 Town of Damariscotta: $20,000 for Downtown Damariscotta Coastal Hazards Preliminary Engineering Study in partnership with Lincoln County and the Lincoln County Regional Planning Commission. The Town of Damariscotta, in cooperation with the Lincoln County Regional Planning Commission (LCRPC) will retain an engineering consultant to evaluate options for protecting the downtown from flooding, storm surges and rising seas. The LCRPC and the Maine Geological Survey (MGS) completed a Coastal Hazards-Sea Level Rise impact study of Lincoln County?s 450 miles of tidal shoreline in 2013 utilizing funding from the Coastal Communities grant program. The results of this study indicated that Damariscotta is the most significantly impacted coastal village in the Lincoln County. 6 Washington County Council of Governments: $26,0000 for Working Waterfronts Preparing for Climate Change in partnership with the University of Maine Machias GIS Service Center and Laboratory and the Towns of Milbridge, Jonesport, Machiasport, Cutler, Lubec and Eastport. This project will add working waterfront wharves and piers as a specific asset to climate vulnerability assessments in six Washington County towns. These communities are the most significant working harbors in Washington County, in terms of numbers of boats, infrastructure, and population dependent on waterfronts to make a living. This project will give municipal leaders and those dependent on working waterfront infrastructure information required to assess the vulnerability of that infrastructure to rising sea levels as well as higher frequency of and intensity storm events. This is the fourth round of the Coastal Community Grant Program. Since 2012, 25 grants have been awarded for a total of $629,042.

Projects will be funded in the following categories: - Conservation and recreational lands - Farmland protection - Working Waterfront access protection - Public access to Maine Waters, for boating, fishing and swimming Proposals will be accepted by the LMF program until 5:00 PM, March 28, 2014. LMF Board Chair William Vail of Saco said ?It is exciting to begin a new round of conservation projects because they are good for Maine. We encourage proposals to increase public access to our State's remarkable public resources and projects that will open the door for the people of Maine to experience the very best of our outdoor heritage.? Walter E. Whitcomb, Commissioner of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, and a member of the LMF Board, said ?We are pleased these funds are available to invest in outdoor recreation, conservation, working forests, farms and waterfront access protection. The local projects funded through these bonds support our vital natural resource industries, and sustainable jobs.? Eligible applicants include state agencies, non-profit land conservation organizations, counties, cities and towns. Proposals that seek to protect Deer Wintering Areas will receive priority consideration in scoring. These are habitat areas that provide shelter and food for white-tailed deer during months of severe cold and deep snow. This new emphasis on deer habitat originated in the statute which authorized the bond approved by voters in 2012. At its November 19 meeting, the Board adopted guidelines for organizations seeking LMF funding. Applicants are encouraged to read the ?Proposal Workbook,? which provides detailed instructions on how proposals should be submitted and will be evaluated. The revised 2013 Workbook is posted on the LMF website at http:www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf All conservation, recreation, farmland protection and water access proposals must be sponsored by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or the Maine Historic Preservation Commission. Projects in the category of ?conservation and recreational lands? are divided into three sub-categories: statewide, regional, or local significance. Regional and local projects may be held by local units of government or non-profit land conservation organizations. Proposals for Working Waterfront Protection projects will be solicited by the Department of Marine Resources (DMR) in early 2014. The LMF Board administers the Working Waterfront Program jointly with the DMR. Legislation requires a matching contribution of funds of at least $1 for each $1 of LMF funding, with matching funds from other sources such as federal grants or private donations. Additional information will be updated on the LMF website [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf) The LMF program works with citizens, land trusts, businesses, municipalities, nonprofit organizations, and federal and state agencies to identify special lands to accomplish the State's goals for resource conservation and protection of working forests, farms and waterfronts. The program is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and is supported by bonds approved by Maine voters.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Division of Animal and Plant Health urges Mainers to take the time and care worthy of this significant and potentially joyful step when considering obtaining a new dog or cat. ?Healthy pets make happy owners. We want all Mainers to have a positive experience adopting a new family member,? noted Maine State Veterinarian, Dr. Michele Walsh. ?Obtaining a pet is a significant emotional and economic commitment. Taking a few additional steps up front will help ensure that a new pet is healthy and well-adjusted, and can prevent disappointment down the road.? By doing some important but basic research ahead of time, Mainers can help ensure the animal they are adopting is healthy and the animal organization with which they are working is compliant with Maine laws designed to protect consumers. Paying close attention to these details can increase the likelihood that new pets will bring many years of enjoyment to Maine families. Cautionary Tale: At the end of September, a stray puppy brokered by an out-of-state rescue organization was adopted by a Vermont family. Shortly after the adoption, the puppy began exhibiting signs consistent with rabies and was ultimately euthanized and tested for the disease. The pup tested positive for rabies, and more than 15 people exposed to her received rabies post-exposure treatment. This situation, while unusual, underscores the importance of exercising due diligence and dealing with reputable sources when obtaining a new pet. Fortunately, many groups ? including local humane societies, shelters, rescue organizations and breeders - do wonderful work with animals and provide excellent opportunities to meet and learn about potential new pets prior to taking them home. Interacting with animals on-site prior to adoption gives families a chance to learn about any special behavioral or health requirements the animal might have, and obtain a copy of the animal?s vaccination and health records. Reputable groups work closely with licensed veterinarians who assess the health of the animals in the facility, treat any medical issues, and may spay or neuter new arrivals before they are made available for adoption. Dr. Walsh recommends the following tips when adopting a new pet: - Work with a reputable local humane society whenever possible - Meet with the pet prior to adopting to ensure that its behavior and demeanor are a good match for your family - Obtain a copy of the animal?s medical record, vaccination history, and Certificate of Veterinary Inspection - Ensure that the dog or cat is vaccinated for rabies if it is three months of age or older - If working with a rescue organization, ensure that it is properly registered and licensed in the state of Maine and in the state where the business is based, and/or with USDA Animal Care. Mainers can contact the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Animal Health office at (207)287-3701 for more information on which animal rescue and breeding organizations are appropriately registered or visit the Animal Health section of the DACF website [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/ahw/animal_health/index.shtml](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/ahw/animal_health/index.shtml) for more information on this topic.

State officials applauded the decision of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reevaluate the new food safety rules impacting farmers in Maine. They also thanked Maine producers for speaking up about the potential impact of the rules and Maine?s congressional delegation for calling for public input. ?The FDA decision to revisit water quality standards and testing, in particular, is a welcome development and an acknowledgement that the voices of Maine producers have been heard,? said Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Before the FDA listening tour, the proposed rules were headed in a direction that was not helpful to local producers. Particular thanks go to the farmers and producers who made their voices heard at the DACF hosted FDA listening session in August, through the public comment process, and to Maine?s congressional delegation for calling for greater public input.? Governor Paul R. LePage stressed the importance of having federal agencies be responsive to the needs of local farmers and producers and not imposing one-size-fits-all regulations that restrict job growth and economic development unnecessarily. ?This is a case where Maine citizens and their elected representatives worked together to ensure that our voices were heard at the federal level. I commend Commissioner Whitcomb and the DACF for studying the law, the proposed rules, and then working at all levels to help bring about the FDA listening session in Maine. There is no reason why the FDA can?t develop a reasonable food safety program that also recognizes the importance of small farms in Maine and across the country.? On August 19, 2013, the DACF?s Division of Quality Assurance & Regulations held a listening session on the proposed FDA produce safety. Produce growers and packers attended to learn more about the federal government?s proposed food safety rule and express their concerns at the Augusta State Armory. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) passed in January 2011 represents the most comprehensive reform of food regulation in more than 70 years. A key component of the FSMA is a mandate to shift food safety efforts from reaction to prevention.

After heat, power, and other utilities have been restored, property owners will be faced with the issue of what to do with ice-covered trees. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF)?s Bureau of Forestry offers several tips and helpful guidance to property owners faced with question about what to do with ice-covered trees, limbs and branches. Trees and branches on homes and around power lines- Homeowners obviously need to find immediate solutions for trees and branches on their homes. Branches and trees on power lines should be dealt with by calling local power companies. Even if a hanging limb is clear of power and utility wires, homeowners should assess the severity of the damage before trying to repair or remove the branch. Trees covered with ice - Make a potentially dangerous situation even more so. Do not work around limbs that have broken off (or partially broken off) and are hung up in a tree crown. These can break off at any time with devastating force. Contact a licensed and insured arborist. Injured trees requiring climbing or chainsaw work - Call a licensed arborist for help. Arborists are tree-care professionals who are trained to assess and correct storm damaged trees. They also have the experience needed to diagnose how much of a tree can or should be saved. Homeowners should be wary of those offering fly-by-night, emergency tree-cutting services. Advice for trees that do not pose a threat: Wait until the ice has melted to perform tree work. Do not try to remove it by shaking branches free. In most cases the safest course of action is to let nature take its course. Attempting to remove it while it is still covered with ice can cause more damage and breakage than leaving it alone. Ice accumulation is hardest on broad-leaved, deciduous trees, especially ones that had a defect. Bent over trees, particularly birches, will often recover once the ice melts.

The revised rules provide those in the recreational lodging industry greater flexibility, with the goal of allowing them to deliver the services customers demand and better compete in the marketplace, while protecting natural resources. The Commission worked with stakeholder groups to respond to changes in the marketplace, consumer demand and the need to ensure that the unique natural characteristics of the unorganized areas will be there for future generations. ?These rule revisions are an example of how Maine state government supports job growth in our natural resource economy in a responsible way,\" said Governor Paul R. LePage. \"This initiative allows operators flexibility in deciding how best to operate their recreational lodging businesses. It will also create more jobs, where they?re very much needed, in rural areas of the State.\" Commissioner Walt Whitcomb stressed the importance of customer service and his Department?s commitment to job growth. ?This initiative is one of the ways that state government is now being responsive to the needs of job creators. These rule revisions are the product of a thoughtful, collaborative process that recognizes trends in the recreational lodging industry and addresses them without sacrificing the natural characteristics we are there to enjoy,? said Whitcomb. ?The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry will continue to pursue opportunities so that Maine can prosper and realize its full natural resource potential.? RULE REVISIONS: Over the past two years Maine Land Use Planning Commission (\"Commission\") has been working with stakeholders to understand changing market demands for recreational lodging services and identify ways in which the regulatory structure can be improved to encourage well-sited recreation businesses. Based on stakeholder feedback, ideas, and concerns the Commission recently adopted a comprehensive revision of its rules in a number of ways that address a majority of the known issues regarding recreational lodging. This initiative evolved from a recognition that the Land Use Planning Commission?s regulations affecting sporting camps, rental cabins, and recreational lodging facilities more generally were in need of updating. For example, the square footage limitation on sporting camps, which at one time was developed in conjunction with sporting camp owners, no longer was large enough to allow these facilities to provide the types of amenities needed to compete in today?s market place. Instead of a group of guys heading to a sporting camp and all bunking together, families and husbands and wives want to visit these facilities but not necessarily all bunk together. RESOURCES & DESCRIPTIONS: Detailed information on the rule revisions is available at: [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/lupc/projects/recreationallodging/recreationallodging.shtml](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/lupc/projects/recreational_lodging/recreational_lodging.shtml) WHAT NEXT? LUPC staff are now working to implement the new rules so that facility owners and operators can take advantage of the greater flexibility and benefits that they provide. Staff will be reaching out to facility owners in the coming months in order to offer assistance and identify aspects of importance to recreational lodging businesses. During this transition phase, staff will also be revising application forms and undertaking staff initiated rezonings.

Each grantee will provide a minimum of 25% in matching funds or services. ?Commercial and public access to Maine?s coastline is important for fisherman, businesses that rely on tourism and public enjoyment of our natural resources,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?These projects will promote local access and economic activity along the Maine coast.? ?The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry is a partner with many communities in their efforts to improve coastal access for commercial and recreational users,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Our Maine Coastal Program Grants help provide communities with technical assistance, infrastructure design and expanded access to Maine?s coastal resources.? Grants were awarded as follows: Town of Wiscasset: $20,000 for the design of the Wiscasset Waterfront Boardwalk. The town of Wiscasset will use this funding to create a Riverfront Boardwalk from the Commercial Pier to Route 1 along the Sheepscot River, thereby providing full pedestrian linkage between all waterfront access points in the village, while also expanding opportunities for sustainable ecotourism with greater access to the coastline. Town of Eliot: $15,200 for developing a plan to improve access to the Piscataqua River in two different locations: Park Street and Pleasant Street. The town will develop a plan to improve public access for both properties using a land scape architect, an engineer, and through the solicitation of substantial public feedback. Town of Kittery: $20,000 for the design of a wave protection system in Pepperell Cove. The town will solicit bids for engineering work that will in turn investigate the placement of wave attenuation devices in an effort to more effectively protect the Pepperell Cove mooring fields and associated waterfront infrastructure. Town of Rockland: $6,000 for engineer planning to facilitate the improvement of the existing boat ramp at Snow Marine Park. This access point is used by recreational and commercial fishermen from across Midcoast Maine. It is also one terminus of Rockland?s Harbor Trail providing a pedestrian connection to downtown Rockland. Town of Lubec: $12,000 for the design of the Lubec gangway and seasonal dock facility. The project will improve public water access by adding an additional ADA approved gangway, two dedicated transient moorings and a seasonal floating dock system at the former Lubec Marina in Lubec. The funds will cover planning, engineering and materials for this project. Recreational boaters, commercial fishermen and passenger vessels compete for limited access to the Lubec waterfront. This project will increase the desirability of Lubec and the surrounding communities as a tourist destination. Towns of Perry/Pembroke: $12,468 for the development of a mooring plan and improvements to public access. The towns of Perry and Pembroke propose to cooperate in the preparation (Perry) and update (Pembroke) of a mooring ordinance for each community. The Town of Pembroke proposes to prepare a mooring plan including a GIS map of mooring sites, remove inappropriate mooring materials from past practices, and install 3-4 town-owned moorings within the newly defined mooring area. The Town of Perry proposes to investigate the status of municipal title and rights of way to Stickney Beach from the Shore Road. This is the eighth round of Shore and Harbor Planning Grant solicitations. Since 2006, 55 grants have been awarded for a total of $714,710.

The Land for Maine's Future (LMF) Program has announced that after a thorough search and selection process it has named Ed Meadows as its new Director, effective January 6. Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Bureau Director Robert Marvinney made the announcement. \"I am pleased to announce that Ed Meadows has been selected as the Director of the Land for Maine's Future Program. We had many qualified candidates, but Ed's experience managing programs, working with citizen boards, enthusiasm for conservation, and his knowledge of appraising and conserving land uniquely position him to be LMF Director. We are pleased to have a strong leader at this important time as the program begins the release of new bond funds for land conservation.? \"Our ACF Department has finished the legislatively directed process of adding LMF to the Bureau of Resource Information and Land Use Planning,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Under the able oversight of Director Robert Marvinney, and with the selection of program director Meadows, the Land for Maine?s Future program is well prepared with updated project selection criteria for the upcoming round of bond funding.\" Upon learning of his selection, Ed Meadows stated \"I am honored to be chosen for this position, leading a program that is hugely popular with Maine citizens, conserving important natural resources so vital to our state?s heritage of forestry, farming, hunting, fishing and outdoor recreation. I look forward to working with the LMF Board and our partners to protect the best of Maine's natural resources and water access sites for future use and enjoyment by Maine people and visitors to our state.? Mr. Meadows has served as acting LMF Director since November 2012. After beginning his career in Maine, Mr. Meadows worked for the Michigan Department of Natural Resources on land conservation and administration of Michigan?s five million acres of state owned land. As Manager of Real Estate Services he was responsible for land acquisitions, appraisals, negotiations, land exchanges, sale of surplus land, easements and leases. He is a former member of the LMF Board, and as Director of the Maine Bureau of Public Lands, was the state?s chief negotiator for LMF acquisitions. Land for Maine?s Future Program: Established in 1987 by referendum, the LMF program administers funds to acquire land for conservation, water access, outdoor recreation, fish and wildlife habitat, farmland preservation, archaeological sites and working waterfronts. The program is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. The Land for Maine?s Future Board recently announced a Call for Proposals for land conservation projects using funding from approximately $10.4 million in LMF bonds approved by Maine voters. Projects will be funded in the following categories: - Conservation and recreational lands - Farmland protection - Working Waterfront access protection - Public access to Maine Waters, for boating, fishing and swimming Since creation of the fund, over 560,000 acres have been acquired, entirely from willing sellers. Reflecting LMF?s support of traditional Maine industries, this includes about 315,000 acres in conservation easements, where the land remains in private ownership and is managed for forestry and agricultural purposes with permanent conservation agreements. The projects include 39 farmland protection agreements covering more than 9000 acres of prime agricultural land and 21 working water front projects which protect access to coastal waters for commercial fishing. The LMF board consists of nine members: six are private citizens appointed by the Governor, the remaining three are the commissioners of the departments of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF), Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, and Marine Resources. The LMF Board administers the Working Waterfront Program jointly with the Department of Marine Resources. The program works with citizens, land trusts, businesses, municipalities, nonprofit organizations, and federal and state agencies to identify special lands to accomplish the State's goals. There are four categories of projects: 1) Conservation and Recreation Lands; 2) Farmlands; 3) Working Waterfronts and 4) Water Access Lands. Funding is drawn from sale of bonds approved by voters, most recently in 2012. Since 1987, there have been six bond proposals, all of which were approved by voters. By law, the LMF program seeks matching funds at a ratio of at least $1 of match for every $1 of public funds expended.

In a move designed to provide fresh fish to families in need, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Hunters for the Hungry Program announced today that it is expanding its program to include donations from two popular ice fishing derbies held in January and February, with the fish from the two events going to Wayside Food Programs, a Portland-based, hunger relief agency. ?The Hunters for the Hungry Program has found yet another way to help families in need, this time by enlisting the support of ice fisherman and two communities with successful ice fishing tournaments,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Innovative programs like this encourage neighbors helping neighbors and engage entire communities, in this case, ice fisherman. The fact that this program has been so successful is both a testament to the need and the generosity of Mainers.? The Hunters for the Hungry Program provides a means for hunters (and now ice fishermen) to donate to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households with a medical need. Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb noted that since its establishment in 1996, the program has grown steadily and provided thousands of nutritious meals to hungry people across the state. ?I can?t say enough about the role Maine sportsmen and women play in helping provide nutritious meals to hungry people across Maine. This is example of how our Department is working with others, in this case Wayside Food Programs and Salt & Sea in Portland, to help build awareness of the great need for additional supporters and contributions that feed Maine families. Successful participation at these two Maine ice fishing derbies will allow us to further expand this successful program to help more families in need,? said Whitcomb. Wayside?s Operations Manager Don Morrison highlighted the importance of this joint effort with the Hunters for the Hungry Program and the need for fresh fish, which is usually difficult for Wayside to get. ?This is a great way to get local, fresh fish to people in need,? said Don Morrison. ?Too many people are having trouble putting healthy food on their tables,? he said. ?This fish is a welcome, healthy addition to what we are serving with our partners at Community Meals. When we are able to serve fish at meals it is a big hit, and the pantries that access our food really appreciate the chance to offer fish to clients. It is also a unique opportunity to salvage fish that might otherwise go to waste.? Participating Ice Fishing Derbies: Wayside Food Programs will be at each event with a truck, where donated fish will be put on ice. The fish will be processed by Salt & Sea, a family-owned fish dealer in Portland. Salt & Sea will provide Wayside with fillets that will be served at Community Meals and distributed to area food pantries.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has released a preliminary report on the results of the 2012 Census of Agriculture. This report shows that while the number of farms declined by 4 percent nationally, the number of Maine and New England farms has increased since 2007 when the last census was conducted. In 2012, there were 8,174 Maine farms, up from 8,136 in 2007 and 7,196 in 2002. The preliminary data includes the number of farms, land in farms (acreage), market value of agricultural products sold including government payments, and demographics for Maine, the nation and for Puerto Rico. USDA will release the full Census results, including data to the county level, later in the spring. ?The preliminary Census of Agriculture results show that Maine continues to lead New England in the number of farms,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?The market value of Maine?s agricultural products has increased 24% since 2007. The fact that Maine has made progress in a number of areas during a challenging economic environment is a testiment to the resiliance and hard work of farmers and processors. My administration will continue to promote future growth in agriculture and our natural resource economy.? ?The Census of Agriculture is an important indicator of the status and health of agriculture in Maine and the nation as a whole,? said DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Although we are aware of challenges for certain food production sectors like dairy, the full Census results in the spring will help us to assess our strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for future growth. As part of the LePage Administration?s focus on agriculture and all aspects of the natural resource economy, Maine combined three natural resource agencies into the DACF leaving Maine well-positioned for future growth and the creation of natural resource jobs.? Conducted since 1840, the Census of Agriculture is a complete count of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. It is conducted every five years by the federal National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to produce official data about U.S. agriculture. It is a uniform, comprehensive source of agricultural data for every county in the nation.

If your home or business is located near a water body, the Maine Floodplain Management Program encourages you to purchase flood insurance to protect your investment. Standard home- and business-owners? insurance policies do not cover flood-related damages. Since 1968, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) has been offering flood insurance, which can be purchased through local property and casualty insurance agents. Rates are set and do not differ from company to company or agent to agent. These rates depend on many factors, which include the date and type of construction of the building, along with the building?s level of flood risk. March and April are historically when flooding occurs in Maine, but heavy rains can cause flooding any time of the year. It is estimated that up to 75% of homes and businesses in floodplains in Maine are not covered by flood insurance. The average annual premium in Maine is $1029.00. As long as your community participates in the National Flood Insurance Program, you can buy flood insurance no matter where you live. There is a 30-day waiting period before any new policy goes into effect. Consider buying flood insurance now, so you won?t be without flood coverage when you need it most. For more information, please visit the official site of the NFIP: [http://www.floodsmart.gov.](http://www.floodsmart.gov.) Additional information is available by calling the Maine Floodplain Management Program at 287-8063. Maine Maple Sunday is this weekend! March 18, 2014 For more information contact: Jessica Nixon at: (207) 287-3494 The flow of maple sap surely means spring is on the way AUGUSTA ? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb today invited families to visit the nearly 100 Maine sugarhouses open to the public this Sunday, March 23, as part of Maine Maple Sunday. The annual event, held every fourth Sunday in the month of March, will take place for the 31st time. Participating sugarhouses will be open for visitors to enjoy freshly made maple syrup and candy, demonstrations of syrup production, sugarbush tours and a variety of other family activities. On March 5, Governor Paul R. LePage highlighted the start of Maine?s maple season by tapping a maple tree on the Blaine House lawn with legislators and representatives from the Maine Maple Producers Association. The Governor used the annual event to highlight the economic contributions of Maine?s maple syrup industry and its potential to create more jobs. ?This industry demonstrates the excellent opportunity Maine has to promote its natural resource-based economy, as well as to promote job creation for our citizens,? said Governor LePage. ?According to a recent study, Maine?s maple industry contributes an estimated $27.7 million directly to the Maine economy. That same study also shows that Maine?s maple industry has an annual statewide economic contribution, including multiplier effects, of an estimated $48.7 million in output, 805 full- and part-time jobs and $25.1 million in labor income.? Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb noted the support that Maine?s maple industry receives from a variety of sources. ?Governor LePage, the Legislature and the Maine Maple Producers Association have worked together to grow this industry in recognition of it significance to Maine?s rural economy,? said Commissioner Whitcomb. ?The maple industry symbolizes how Maine can have multiple uses of its natural resources, including maple syrup, wood production, recreation and open space.? The study quoted by Governor LePage was conducted by University of Maine Professor of Economics Todd Gabe and funded through a partnership between the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, University of Maine and the Maine Maple Producers Association. Other key findings of the study: Maine has the third largest maple industry in the United States. Maine?s maple industry is characterized by a relatively small number of farms accounting for the vast majority of syrup that is produced. Maine?s licensed maple syrup producers have been in operation an average of 24 years, and many of the farms span multiple generations. Maine?s maple industry?which counts the licensed producers and sales at retail food stores and businesses impacted by Maine Maple Sunday?generates 567 full- and part-time jobs and $17.3 million in labor income. Some sugarhouses will hold events on both Saturday and Sunday.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Bureau of Parks and Lands is pleased to announce that it is seeking grant proposals to improve recreational boating access to the waters of the State of Maine for fiscal year 2015, which begins July 1, 2014 and ends June 30, 2015. ?With 2,300 great ponds, 32,000 miles of streams and rivers and over 3,000 miles of coastline, the State of Maine offers unparalleled opportunities for recreational boating,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?However, with only 460 assured public recreational boat access sites, we need to do more to ensure the public has adequate access to these waters.? The Maine Legislature established the Boating Facilities Fund in 1963, which is administered by the Bureau of Parks and Lands, Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, and funded with the state tax on gasoline used by recreational motor boats. The Bureau uses these funds to acquire, develop and renovate recreational boat access sites and to place and maintain navigational buoys on nearly 50 inland lakes and ponds. The Bureau?s philosophy is that boating access sites are more efficiently managed on the local level and so accomplishes most of its mission of providing boat access through a grant process. Grants are limited to a maximum of $150,000 and must be completed by June 30, 2016. A cash or in-kind match equal to 50% of approved project costs is required. Project proposals are due June 25, 2014. A pre-application inspection by Bureau staff must be completed before an application is submitted.

Before an assembly of Margaret Chase Smith School students, Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb announced the 2013 Maine winner of the Bonnie Plants 3rd Grade Cabbage Program, Justin Kennedy. Justin received a $1,000 scholarship for growing a 19-pound cabbage as part of Bonnie Plant?s annual nationwide contest. Speaking to a gathering of students, teachers and parents, Commissioner Whitcomb stressed the importance of healthy, locally grown foods and the people who grow them, including Justin Kennedy. ?School programs like the Bonnie Plants Cabbage Program help foster interest in agriculture at an early age and the importance of knowing how food is produced,? said Commissioner Whitcomb. ?Justin and the other participating students throughout Maine are helping build awareness and support for gardening and healthy, local food production.? Governor Paul R. LePage was equally enthusiastic in his praise for school programs that promote personal responsibility, accomplishment and the confidence that come from seeing a successful project from start to finish. ?Growing a 19-pound cabbage requires skills and perseverance that will serve Justin well in the years ahead,? said Governor LePage. ?If Maine agriculture is to continue to grow and prosper, it will need to attract new farmers from today?s classrooms.? About The Cabbage Program: In 2002, Bonnie Plants started the 3rd Grade Cabbage Program with a mission to inspire a love of vegetable gardening in young people. Each year, Bonnie Plants distributes more than one million free cabbage plants to 3rd Grade classrooms across the country. As part of the program, Bonnie Plants awards a $1,000 scholarship to one student in each state. Teachers submit a class winner and a child is chosen via random drawing by each state?s Director of Agriculture. As one of the first companies to sponsor a national vegetable gardening initiative for kids, Bonnie Plants has delivered over 11 million cabbage plants nationwide, fostering an interest in gardening, healthy eating and the environment along the way.

Citizens seeking to burn brush, wood debris or agricultural fields now have the option to obtain their open burning permits electronically. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Bureau of Forestry announced that it has expanded the online burn permit system statewide. Traditional hand-written burn permits are still available, but the online system allows permits to be acquired 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, providing that the fire danger is not high. ?The ability of Maine citizens to conduct business online saves time and money and helps make state government more responsive and open,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?This is another positive change in the way we do business that will benefit the public. And please remember, only burn during periods of low fire danger and always be safe when making and tending to burn fires.? Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb noted that with this expansion Maine continues to be a leader in providing online burn permits. ?Maine is one of the first states to issue permits electronically,? said Whitcomb. ?The online burn permit system has proven to be a convenient, safe and reliable alternative means to obtain burn permits. We are pleased to be able to offer it to all Maine citizens.? To expand the online system to cover the entire state, Forest Rangers, in cooperation with the Maine Fire Chiefs Association, made several improvements to the online burn permit system. The system has been available in certain southern Maine counties since 2005. Unlike the previous system, revenues will now be shared with the municipality where the burn will occur. When permits are issued, the system can also notify up to twenty Town Fire Wardens and Fire Department personnel with emails or text messages. According to Chief Forest Ranger Bill Hamilton, ?the online system is safe and only allows permits to be issued on class one or two days when the fire danger is low. By encouraging people to burn after 5pm during periods of low to moderate fire danger, the chance of the burn escaping decreases significantly.? Online burn permits can be obtained at any time and are valid for 48 hours after payment has been submitted. The Fire Chief or Town Warden for each municipality is able to impose further restrictions on allowable burn times or needed personnel and equipment.

Hunt for the Emerald Ash Borer in Yarmouth, April 22 The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Forest Pest Outreach and Survey Project is teaming up with the town of Yarmouth to survey that town?s ash street trees in celebration of Earth Day. Participants will learn how to identify ash trees and how to inspect them for signs of the tree-killing beetle, the emerald ash borer. WHAT: Surveying Yarmouth?s Ash Trees on Earth Day WHEN: Tuesday, April 22, 2014, Noon ? 3 p.m. WHERE: Yarmouth Town Office, 200 Main Street DETAILS: Deb Hopkins, Yarmouth?s tree warden, says that Yarmouth has 330 ash trees lining its streets. The trees will be tagged in advance, and surveyors will be inspecting the trees for signs of emerald ash borer. The emerald ash borer (EAB) has been responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of ash trees across the United States, including parts of New England: MA, NH and CT. This small green, metallic woodboring beetle, that spends most of its life cycle as a larva under the bark, is helped along by people who unwittingly transport infested wood from one area to another. Experience has shown that the best defense a community has against losing their ash trees to EAB is in educating its citizens to learn how to identify ash trees and the signs of an EAB infestation.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) announced today that the final results of the U.S. Department of Agriculture?s (USDA) 2012 Census of Agriculture reveal that Maine agriculture has grown in the face of a challenging national economy. They also show that despite its modest size (compared to large national operations), Maine has out-sized potential for its products to be consumed locally and beyond its borders. ?The Census of Agriculture results show that Maine made progress in a number of areas in the midst of a challenging national economic environment,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?This is due to the resilience and hard work of farmers and processors, strong community support for Maine agriculture and the indomitable spirit of those who put food on our table. These results speak volumes of the potential for growth that will nourish and sustain us physically and economically.? ?The Census of Agriculture is an important indicator of the status and health of agriculture in Maine and nationally and is used to direct policies, programs and resources toward areas that will yield the best results.? said DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?When you balance the overall growth of Maine agriculture against the challenges for certain food production sectors like potatoes and dairy, we remain optimistic about the future. The LePage Administration?s focus on the natural resource economy, through the combined public resources in our new Department, makes Maine well-positioned for future growth and the creation of natural resource jobs.? Maine Highlights from the 2012 Census of Agriculture: Maine continues to lead New England in the number of farms ?The Census shows that while the number of farms declined by 4 percent nationally, the number of Maine and New England farms has increased since 2007 when the last census was conducted. In 2012, there were 8,174 Maine farms, up from 8,136 in 2007 and 7,196 in 2002. Maine farms with $100,000+ sales totaled 785 (10% of farms) and produced 90% of all gross sales. From 2007-2012: The market value of Maine?s agricultural products increased 24%, from $617,190,000 to $763,062,000 Harvested cropland increased from 2007 to 2012 ? The number of farms grew from 5,189 farms to 5,325 farms (acres increased from 393,738-400,960). Cropland declined 10% from 529,253 to 477,343 acres, replaced by harvested hayland, increased pasture land and farm managed woodlots Irrigated land increased by 47%, with the number of farms increasing from 901 to 1,365 (20,994 to 30,887 acres) Vegetables harvested for sale increased by 9%, with the number of farms increasing from 968 to 1,473 (66,783 to 72,657 acres) Total covered greenhouse vegetables and green cut herbs increased. The number of growers increased from 125 to 386, with square feet under cover increasing from 1,289,335 to 2,955,180 square feet. (Note: This reduces weather risk and increased year round vegetable production) Aquaculture: The value of sales increased by 185% (from $26,300,000 to $75,107,000) AG Labor: The number of operations with hired workers increased 28% (going from 1,886 to 2,415), with workers hired greater than 150 days increasing 29% (the number of workers hired for less than 150 days declined by -13%) The number of Maple producers increased by 10% (468-517) and the number of taps went from 1,487,473 to 1,884,466 (increase of 27%) Agri-Tourism: Income from Farm-related, AG Tourism & Recreational Services increased 78% (Increasing from $1,012,000 to $1,803,000). Participating farms increased from by 141% (112 to 270 farms) CENSUS OF AGRICULTURE: The Maine Department of Agriculture had its origins in 1839, just before the first national Census of Agriculture was conducted in 1840. The Census of Agriculture is a complete count of U.S. farms and ranches and the people who operate them. It highlights changing trends in U.S. operator demographics, agriculture production and farm economics. It is conducted every five years by the federal National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to produce official data about U.S. agriculture. It is a uniform, comprehensive source of agricultural data for every county in the nation. Like other farms around the country, all Maine farmers are required to complete surveys every five years.

May 6, 2014 For more information contact: Gary Fish at: (207) 287-7545 Before you act, please read this! AUGUSTA?With melting snow and ice, rising temperatures and the arrival of lawn and gardening season, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) is advising homeowners to do their homework before attempting to manage lawn grubs. DACF is seeking to reduce unnecessary, ineffective pesticide use to manage these pests. Many resources are available through the University of Maine and the Maine YardScaping Partnership to make this homework light. As lawns begin to turn green, homeowners often notice patches and larger sections of grass that are brown and dead looking. Frequently, they conclude the browning is caused by grubs and run out to purchase grub control products. Even if the damage is, in fact, being caused by grubs, the latest scientific research indicates that spring is not the best time to manage a grub problem. ?Springtime is not the best time for grub control,? says Jim Dill, manager of the University of Maine Cooperative Extension Pest Management Office. ?As they emerge from winter, grubs are mature and this is when they are least susceptible to pesticides. Wait until early-May to mid-June to apply chlorantraniliprole (AceleprynTM and GrubEx1TM) and early-June to early-July to apply the other grub-control products, depending on the product and the location in Maine. This will allow the insecticide to be fully incorporated into the soil to control the new grubs which are just hatching, are closer to the surface, and are more susceptible to the effects of pesticides. Homeowners trying to control grubs in the spring are simply wasting their time and money. And, when they don?t seem to be working, there?s a tendency to over apply control products, and that?s when excess chemicals run off into our water supplies, and can be harmful to human health and the environment.? Browning lawns can have a number of different causes: ?Before you do anything, there are some important points to consider,? adds Dill. ?First, you must be sure that grubs are the problem. Browning lawns can also be caused by drought, poor soil, disease, or other organisms. And, even if the grubs are positively identified, are they in sufficient numbers to really cause significant damage? Sometimes, reseeding the brown patches is all that can be done. There are also biological controls, like beneficial nematodes, that may have some limited success. If you contact us at the Pest Management Office, we can help you identify your problem, provide many options for solving it and give you the proper timing to apply a specific control product in your area.? Grubs?the white, immature, C-shaped form of beetles, most notably Japanese beetles and European chafers?feed on the roots of grass and cause the browning that we see. Knowing the grub?s life cycle is critical in determining if you have a problem, what to do about it, and when. From beetles emerging from the ground in early summer, through three distinct stages of grubs ending in the fall, keeping track of grubs can be difficult. The lawn damage you see in the early spring is actually the result of late summer, fall, and winter feeding. When the grubs are fully grown in the spring, they continue to feed for a short time and change into the pupal or resting stage which is not susceptible to insecticides. Because it can be so tricky to figure out precisely what time is best for controlling grubs and which of the many available products to use, enlisting the services of a lawn care professional may be the surest course to take. They are specialists in treating just this type of problem and will identify exactly what?s going on with your lawn. They know what works, what doesn?t, and what is the best time for treatment?or if it?s needed at all. ?When grub-control products are applied at the wrong time, not only do they not work, but many, many pounds of pesticide products are being applied that don't need to be and they can end up where they shouldn?t,? says Deven Morrill, member of the Board of Pesticides Control and arborist at Lucas Tree Experts, a Portland-based company that also does lawn care. ?Just as professionals do, when homeowners apply products to their lawns, it is most important to read the label carefully, follow it exactly, and be sure it?s the right product for the problem at hand, applied at the most effective time. Licensed applicators stay tuned to the latest research and only apply products when they are proven effective.?

Predator Beetles Released to Combat Hemlock Woolly Adelgid May 21, 2014 For more information contact: Allison Kanoti at: (207) 287-3147 Biological-control effort targets invasive insect attacking hemlock trees AUGUSTA ? Over the coming weeks, The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s entomology staff will release more than 10,000 tiny, predator lady beetles in several hemlock woolly adelgid-infested stands in the southern region of the state. The first release of the year will take place on May 29 in Portland?s Baxter Woods in cooperation with the City of Portland. This release is part of an integrated management approach in the city park that also includes monitoring by local high school students, chemical management of adelgid on legacy hemlocks and public education. The tiny, black lady beetles, known as Sasajiscymnus tsugae, will be released to fight the hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA), an invasive insect that attacks hemlock trees. Governor Paul R. LePage stressed the importance of public involvement in efforts to contain, eradicate and prevent invasive species. ?Public awareness of the threats posed by invasive species like the HWA is critical to minimizing their impact,? said Governor LePage. ?Once they have taken hold, it is very difficult and expensive to contain and/or eliminate them. That is why early detection by the public and Department professionals is important.? The biological-control effort won?t eradicate the infestation, but it should reduce the HWA populations according to Allison Kanoti, forest entomologist, under the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF). ?It is not a silver bullet, but it?s the best management tool we have in the forest at this time,? Kanoti said. ?This is a long-term solution; results will not be immediate.? The beetles will come from labs in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Their release is made possible by federal grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture?s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ? Plant Protection & Quarantine program and the US Forest Service. Hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) is a small, aphid-like insect that is covered with white, waxy wool-like material. This wool-like covering makes the insect resemble miniature cotton balls. It is most visible from late-October through July, with woolly masses located on the undersides of the twigs at the bases of the needles. The insect, which came from Japan in the 1950s, causes deterioration of infested trees, including loss of needles, crown thinning and tree death. Hemlocks are a significant Maine tree species. Their presence along water bodies helps protect the forest floor from erosion and buffers water temperatures, which can affect such species as brook trout. Hemlocks also are important in deer wintering areas, are a favored landscape tree and contribute to the state?s forest products sector. The adelgid begins its egg-laying in March. During the spring and summer there are thousands of offspring, called crawlers, crawling around, sifting down through the tree canopy and drifting on the breezes in infested hemlock forests. These young can be transferred to new locations by people, birds and other animals. Hemlock woolly adelgid can also be moved year round on live trees. HWA has been found in at least 19 states. It was first detected in forest trees in Maine in Kittery in 2003. It has most recently been found in forest stands as far up the coast as Owls Head in Knox County and inland to Sanford in York County. Infestations on planted trees have been found from Lubec to Bangor and South, with the most recent detections in Bar Harbor, Blue Hill, Ellsworth, Northeast Harbor, and Sedgwick in Hancock County. Homeowners are among the most frequent reporters of new locations of hemlock woolly adelgid. Other locations are reported by arborists, foresters, land trust stewards, students, tourists and occasionally even entomologists. If you think you?ve found hemlock woolly adelgid, please report your find to the Maine Forest Service.

Jyang-Lee's Kitchen, a Maine company, is voluntarily recalling all Jyang-Lee's Kitchen brand poultry products that did not receive the full benefit of inspection. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Maine Meat and Poultry Inspection (MMPI) program made the announcement today. Jyang-Lee's Kitchens operates an establishment in Coopers Mills, Maine. This recall is being issued because the Coopers Mills, Maine establishment had not been issued a State or USDA Grant of Inspection. Without the Grant of Inspection, inspection program personnel were not assigned to the establishment. Products produced without inspection are considered unfit for human consumption and must be recalled. The products subject to recall include: Jyang-Lee's Turkey Wonton - 15 count plastic bags with no code Jyang-Lee's Mainely-Turkey Elegant Eggroll - 6 count plastic bags with no code Jyang-Lee's Turkey Dumpling - 12 count plastic bags with no code MMPI and the company have received no reports of illnesses due to consumption of these products. The turkey products included were shipped to Maine retailers only. Consumers may return any of the recalled turkey products to the retailer of purchase, or contact Jyang-Lee's Kitchen 207-549-4507. The problem was discovered when MMPI personnel observed Jyang-Lee's Kitchen turkey products offered for sale at retail not bearing the mark of inspection and began an investigation into the establishment. MMPI routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. Media with questions regarding the recall can contact Angela Fargin, with Jyang-Lee's Kitchen at 207-549-4507. Consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact Angela Fargin, with Jyang-Lee?s Kitchen at 207-549-4507.

Supporting documents Flagstaff Region Public Reserved Lands Management Plan June 4, 2014 For more information contact: Jim Vogel at: 207-287-2163 A Public Meeting will be held on June 12 to receive comments on proposed amendments FARMINGTON - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s, Bureau of Parks and Lands will hold a public meeting to receive comments on proposed amendments to the Flagstaff Region Public Reserved Lands Management Plan adopted in 2007. These amendments resulted from a scheduled 5-year Plan review conducted over the last year. The public meeting will be: Thursday, June 12, 2014 6:00-8:00 pm University of Maine-Farmington Olsen Student Center, North Dining Hall A Commissioner Walt Whitcomb stressed the importance of public input and diligent work of the Advisory Committee. ?The Advisory Committee met two times to review the Flagstaff Region Public Reserved Lands Management Plan and review and discuss several proposals. I encourage interested parties to become involved in the future of our public lands by commenting on the proposed amendments,? said Commissioner Whitcomb. The 15-year multiple-use Management Plan adopted by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry, Bureau of Parks and Lands for the Flagstaff Region in 2007 is subject to reviews at the 5 and 10 year intervals, and a full revision at 15 years. The purpose of the 5-year review is to document progress on addressing the Plan recommendations, and to assess whether any conditions have changed that would warrant amendments to the Plan prior to the 15-year revision. This review is conducted first with the Plan Advisory Committee (AC), and if any amendments are proposed, a public meeting is required to receive comments prior to adoption of any amendments. The Bureau held two AC meetings in August and December of 2013, where several proposals developed by regional trails organizations were presented and discussed. These proposals are for new non-motorized trails at Chain of Ponds, and at the Bigelow Preserve and adjacent public lands; and for a new motorized trail crossing the Appalachian Trail on the Redington Lot. Also discussed was a proposal for a new trailered boat access on the east side of Flagstaff Lake, related to federal requirements for operation of the Flagstaff Lake hydropower project. The Bureau has determined that the proposed amendments are warranted due to conditions not considered in the 2007 Plan development. The proposed amendments have been posted on the Department website at [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/about/calendar/meeting.shtml?id=616580.](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/about/calendar/meeting.shtml?id=616580.) There you will find downloadable copies of the Management Plan and proposed amendments as well as Advisory Committee meeting minutes. Written comments will be accepted until June 26 ? two weeks after the Public Meeting. After the comment period, the Final plan amendments will be prepared for review and adoption by the Commissioner and will become part of the Flagstaff Region Management Plan.

Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry officials have received numerous calls recently regarding the extensive early ?casting? of white pine needles. Callers have stressed that the white pine crowns of affected trees have turned from the dull winter green to a yellow-straw color and then quickly to tan and brown. Heavy rains resulted in the near complete removal of the affected needles from the trees, leaving crowns appearing thin. With many trees now having only the current-season needles left to photosynthesize, concerns have been raised prompting this informational bulletin from the Department. White pine needle-drop condition The white pine needle disease epidemic has been occurring in Maine, and in most other areas of New England and New York, for at least eight consecutive years. Above-average spring and summer precipitation patterns experienced in the Northeast for the past decade are believed to be a primary factor in facilitating needle infection, caused by the development of one or more of several pathogenic fungi. Fungi infect needles early in spring and develop through the needles during summer and fall. The following year, when the weather warms, the symptoms on the infected one-year-old needles first appear during early to mid-June. The progress from symptom development through needle casting occurs over a very short period of time ? usually about three or four weeks. The symptoms appear as a rapid flare-up of needle yellowing and casting, which has occurred throughout Maine over the past two weeks. This year, trees continue to show weakening due to the stress caused by the reduction in foliage and photosynthetic efficiency. What is being done to address this? State Foresters are collaborating with neighboring states and with the U.S. Forest Service to determine the scope of the problem and identify solutions. In Maine, a survey of damaged trees is currently underway and results will be compared with defoliation estimates from previous years. Early indications are that the severity of disease is similar to that in past years, but that the long-term effect of many consecutive years of the loss of the one-year-old needles has weakened some trees to the point where mortality is now occurring. Other secondary insect and disease problems have also appeared in many stands where sustained and severe damage from the needle disease complex has occurred, but these effects are not yet well-understood. It appears that for the foreseeable future, white pine will be another threatened resource unless the needle disease epidemic abates, either from a break in the weather and moisture patterns, or from some other as yet unknown reason. What can you do? Control or management recommendations are limited, but state foresters urge caution before conducting thinning operations. As this season progresses, current-season foliage will develop that will help to ?mask? the thin appearance of the crowns. Heavily infected stands and trees in stands where mortality is believed to be the result of needle diseases may be salvaged. Thinning efforts need to be carefully considered, as thinning operations may cause additional stress and result in an increase in mortality and stand collapse. In the meantime, landowners should consult with a professional before thinning operations. Who can you contact? Woodland owners are encouraged to contact their licensed forester to help assess the actual impact of the blight on their woods. For yard and ornamental trees, contact a licensed arborist. If you need help finding a resource professional, contact the Maine Forest Service at 1-800-367-0223 (in state) or (207) 287-2791.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s (DACF) Bureau of Parks and Lands (BPL) announced that construction work has begun on two hiking trails that eventually will be part of an expanded network of non-motorized trails in the Moosehead Lake Region. The decision to start construction with the Number Four Mountain and Eagle Rock Trails resulted from public input and will be led by the DACF?s Maine Conservation Corps. The one-of-a-kind regional trail development collaboration is made possible through a 121-acre trail easement granted by landowner Plum Creek. Construction by the Maine Conservation Corps began in June, and will likely continue until 2018 in order to complete the entire trail network. ?Outdoor recreation is important to Maine residents and visitors. This public-private partnership will expand outdoor recreational opportunities in the Moosehead Lake Region,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?This project benefits from public input and volunteer support, so I encourage others to become involved.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb also highlighted the importance of public input and volunteer support. ?We were pleased with the public?s input that this unique project has received,? said Whitcomb. ?Citizen input is helping create another gem in Maine?s outstanding system of trails and public recreational spaces. The partnership of a major landowner, townspeople and state recreation management experts is a formula for success in this beautiful region of Maine.? Project leader Rex Turner said that the Department and project partners are looking forward to engaging new partners and volunteers for this effort to help support, maintain and promote the trails well into the future. ?With these new trails, and others following in the next few years, the Moosehead Lake Region will offer a premiere trail network that will be a destination attracting hikers, bikers, skiers and others from far and wide,? said Rex Turner, BPL outdoor recreation planner. An ad-hoc committee led by BPL is coordinating the trail planning effort, and will hold its next informational meeting this fall. Participants and supporters in that effort include citizens from the Moosehead Lake Region and representatives from the Appalachian Mountain Club, Forest Society of Maine, Maine Huts and Trails, the Moosehead Lake Region Chamber of Commerce, the Town of Greenville and Plum Creek. The first two trails to be constructed are: Number Four Mountain Trail ? This project taking place through the summer of 2014, rebuilds and redesigns the current Number Four Mountain Trail. It will reach the remains of the historic fire tower on the mountain and also feature a trailhead parking facility on Plum Creek land. Additionally, planning calls for the trail to be expanded southwards from the summit to Lily Bay Mt. and beyond. The current Number Four Mountain Trail remains open to hikers during construction. Eagle Rock Trail ? This new trail will be completed in August and will create 3.7 miles of hiking trail from the Moore Bog area on the BPL?s Little Moose Public Land property to Big Moose Mountain?s northwest ridge. The trail will culminate at Eagle Rock and feature a trailhead parking facility on Bureau lands. Planning work under way aims to enable trail construction on portions of Lily Bay Mt. and Baker Mt. in Frenchtown starting as early as this fall. Future trail projects on the 121-acre easement could range from easy walking paths to strenuous backpacking circuits and could accommodate hiking, mountain biking, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, canoe/kayak portaging and wildlife observation activities. In addition to the land easement from Plum Creek, the company is providing funding for the trail system as part of its regional land use agreement. Additional trail system support will be sought by BPL and planning partners to help maintain the trail network. That support is anticipated to include stewardship approaches such as adopt-a-trail opportunities and other similar volunteer initiatives. Six-person trail crews from the Maine Conservation Corps will construct the trails. Volunteers are also encouraged to participate. For more information about volunteer opportunities, contact Mike Hein at 624-6092 or Michael.Hein@maine.gov. Media Invitation: An active day of trail construction by the Maine Conservation Corps will take place on July 10, from 10 am to 2 pm at the site of the new Eagle Rock Trail. Representatives of BPL and other partners will also be present to thank volunteers and assist. Media are invited to join in the volunteer effort or attend to talk to volunteers and organizers.

This plan will guide the Bureau?s multiple-use management of the Crocker Mountain Public Lands Unit, which totals over 12,000 acres. The lands to be addressed are in two main areas: Crocker Mountain (8,000 acres), west of Sugarloaf Mountain, and the Rapid Stream area (4,000 acres), south of Sugarloaf and north of Mount Abraham. The resulting management plan will become part of the Flagstaff Region Management Plan. The Crocker Mountain Unit encompasses a 9.7-mile section of the Appalachian Trail corridor. Snowmobile and ATV trails cross the area on existing forest management roads. It is anticipated approximately 4,000 acres will be designated an Ecological Reserve. At least half of the total property will be managed as a multiple-use working forest where timber harvesting will occur. The upcoming scoping meeting is the first public meeting that will be held on the Crocker Mountain Management Plan. At this meeting we will be asking the audience to provide answers to questions such as: What are your priorities for trail development or other recreational development on these lands? What are any concerns or issues that the plan should addressed? What vision should guide management of these lands over the next 10 years? The public scoping meeting will be: Tuesday, July 22 6:00-8:00 pm Carrabassett Valley Public Library 3209 Carrabassett Drive Carrabassett Valley The Bureau will work with the Flagstaff Region Plan Advisory Committee to develop a draft Plan for Crocker Mountain. Once a final draft Plan is written, a public meeting will be held to receive comments, sometime over the winter of 2014-2015.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s (DACF) Forest Rangers have completed their investigation of the Scarborough, Old Orchard Beach, Saco, Biddeford railroad fires. Investigators have concluded that the fires were caused by sparks emanating from a Pan Am freight train due to an undetermined mechanical problem. The investigation yielded no violations of Maine law. There are no charges pending in relation to the fires. Rangers on average respond to and investigate over 40 railroad caused fires annually. They also patrol hundreds of miles of railroad tracks each year to ensure the vegetation is managed according to state fire prevention laws. Maine?s fire prevention railroad laws are targeted towards reducing fire hazards along the right-of-way and properly maintaining the locomotive engines so that sparks are not thrown from the exhaust into nearby vegetation and start wildfires. Investigation Following a two-month investigation, the Department compiled a 554 page report documenting the cause of the wildfires. The report can be viewed for a limited time at: [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/about/news/oob-report.pdf](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/about/news/oob-report.pdf) What follows is a brief summary of the findings contained in the report: Report Summary On May 8, 2014, Scarborough, Old Orchard Beach, Saco, and Biddeford experienced a minimum of 47 separate fires along the railroad tracks. Two Forest Rangers and a Forest Service helicopter were called upon to respond to the wildfires and assist local fire departments with suppression activities. Several properties were damaged or destroyed as a result of these fires. The hardest hit area was the Wagon Wheel Campground in Old Orchard Beach, which suffered the loss of 10 camper trailers and damage to several others. Total damage estimates are still being tallied by victims and insurance companies, but are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. During the time of the fire starts, Forest Rangers determined that there were two different trains that had passed through the area. Both of these trains were westbound, headed toward Boston and Portsmouth respectively. These trains passed through the same fire areas ranging from 8-13 minutes of each other. The first train to pass through was an Amtrak passenger train on its way to Boston. After the fires were discovered, the Amtrak train was notified and subsequently stopped in Wells, Maine and again in Massachusetts. This passenger train was inspected by Amtrak personnel and found to be free of any defects. Investigators found no witnesses who reported sparks coming from the underside of the Amtrak train. The second train to pass through the area was a freight train operated by Pan Am Railways and led by locomotive 307. Forest Rangers and other law enforcement officers conducted numerous interviews and received multiple eyewitness accounts of sparks coming from the Pan Am freight train. There were multiple reports of sparks, the smell of burning rubber, and smoke coming from the Pan Am freight train immediately preceding the start of the wildfires. Investigators determined that the Pan Am train did stop in Biddeford, but it is unclear if any work was done to correct any mechanical defects during this stop. Forest Rangers held the Pan Am freight train in Dover, New Hampshire where one of their investigators inspected locomotive 307 and its consist. The exhaust stack on locomotive 307 was found to be within compliance of Maine spark arrestor law and was ruled not likely a contributing factor in the wildfire starts. Investigators conducted wildfire cause and origin investigations. They also interviewed many eye witnesses, several Amtrak and Pan Am employees, examined software data from the locomotives, and did wildfire behavior analysis on the forest fuels in the area to determine probabilities of ignition. Metal fragments collected from the points of origin support the eyewitness accounts of sparks originating from the wheels and underside of the south bound Pan Am freight train. As a result of their investigation, Forest Ranger investigators have concluded that the cause of the wildfires was from sparks emanating from the Pan Am freight train due to an undetermined mechanical problem. Major factors leading to the find that the Pan Am freight train caused the fires: Witnesses: During the course of the investigation, multiple witnesses were interviewed and they described the freight train as ?being louder than normal?making loud squealing, clacking, thumping, sounds?sending a shower of sparks from under the train, at the wheels?smelling like burning rubber? and very smoky.? Immediately after the passage of the freight train the fires started. Additionally, the freight train crew did not report any wildfire activity as they traveled through the area. Many recall the passenger train passing earlier, with no out-of-the-ordinary sights, sounds or smells. Fire Behavior Analysis: Fire behavior analysis does not support a theory that Amtrak started smoldering fires which were fanned by the passage of the freight train. Fire behavior analysis indicates that Pan Am?s freight train would have been passing through active wildfires, had Amtrak sparked all these fires. Time Line: At mile post 203 in Scarborough, the freight train stopped to let the passenger train pass. The passenger train stopped in Saco to let on passengers. The freight trains next stop was in Biddeford after they had been alerted that fires had started along the tracks. The passenger train was in Wells when they were notified. The time frames in which these trains passed known points also corroborate the fire behavior analysis. As the Amtrak train continued ahead of Pan Am?s freight train it was gaining a lead time from eight minutes to thirteen minutes within an eight mile stretch. With that much time between the trains, fires would have spread rapidly. Case unusual: This case was unusual in that it was not associated with a poorly maintained spark arrestor or some other mechanical failure that provides clear physical evidence. Eyewitness accounts describe seeing sparks coming from the train?s wheels as if there was some type of mechanical problem. Unfortunately, the environmental conditions on May 8th were favorable for the spread of wildfire. Local fire departments and responders praised: There was a significant amount of property damage and it required crews from at least 20 different fire departments. If not for the outstanding response from these local departments the damages could easily have been more extensive. Thankfully there were no fatalities and no serious injuries reported. One Saco resident was transported by ambulance for smoke inhalation, and one fire fighter was checked out for dehydration/heat exhaustion. Anyone with additional information or questions relevant to these fires is asked to contact the Maine Forest Service at 1-800-750-9777. 25th Annual Maine Open Farm Day July 21, 2014 For more information contact: Jessica Nixon at: 207-287-3494 A Maine tradition, farms will open their gates to the public this Sunday AUGUSTA ? Visit select Maine Farms this Sunday, July 27. All across the State of Maine, close to 90 family farms will open their doors to the public from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Held each year, Open Farm Day is an opportunity for consumers to learn about Maine and Maine food producers and for farms to show the public their products. ?Open Farm Day recognizes the many contributions that farmers make to our economy and highlights the local communities they are located in,? said Maine Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Not only do our farms provide fresh food, but they also demonstrate the virtues of hard work and self-reliance. Despite the national decline in farms, the number of Maine farms is growing, as is the market value of the agricultural products our farms produce. That value has increased 24% since 2007 to more than $763 million. Maine agriculture is also creating more jobs. The number of operations with hired workers has increased 28% in the last five years.? Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb urged families to take advantage of this unique event. ?All across Maine you can visit dozens of small farms; farms with vegetable stands and market gardens; farms with hay rides and home bakeries; farms with sheep, cows, horses, rabbits, pigs or chickens; farms and farm owners who want to show you a fascinating cross section of life growing out in the Maine countryside,? said Whitcomb. ?The Department is pleased to help organize this family oriented event that encourages better understanding of how food happens and how hard working Maine farm families contribute to both the local economy and the locally grown food supply.? Open Farm Day is an annual family event that connects consumers with the men and women who help produce their food. Farms throughout Maine will open their gates to offer the public an opportunity to learn about the business of agriculture. Many farms will have demonstrations, displays, farm-raised products for sale and animals and crops to experience. Activities may include barn and field tours, milking, hay rides, petting zoos, nature trails, beautiful scenery, samples for tasting and refreshments. Events like Open Farm Day have an impact on the Agri-Tourism in the State of Maine. According to the USDA, in 2012, AG Tourism & Recreational Services in Maine increased 78% (Increasing from $1,012,000 to $1,803,000) and participating farms increased by 141% (112 to 270 farms). Now is a great time for consumers to visit and support Maine?s farms and be part of the growing support for locally grown foods. According to Gary Keough, New England Field Office State Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service, ?the average size of a Maine farm is 178 acres, up seven percent since 2007. Organic production and aquaculture sales increased from between 2007 and 2012 as well: the value of aquaculture sales increased from $26.3 million to $75.1 million (ranking us eighth nationally) and organic products increased from $23.3 million to $36.4 million.? To celebrate the 25th Anniversary of this event, participating farms will showcase a Welcome Open Farm Day banner indicating their doors are open to the public.

Appointments to the Maine Seed Potato Board Announced September 8, 2014 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 AUGUSTA ? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb announced today the appointment of David McCrum of Rumford Point and reappointment of Dominic Lajoie of Van Buren to the Maine Seed Potato Board. David McCrum has agreed to serve as a Commissioner?s Appointment and Dominic LaJoie has agreed to be reappointed to the position of a person producing potatoes in Aroostook County primarily for processing. The Maine Seed Potato Board (MSPB) was established in 1945 to ensure an adequate supply of foundation seed potatoes for the state's commercial seed potato producers and ultimately for the Maine potato industry. ?Maine?s potato industry, like Maine agriculture, continues to show resiliency and innovation in the face of new challenges and opportunities,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?These appointments help ensure that growers, producers and consumers are well served by the Maine Seed Potato Board. Maine?s potato industry continues to play a significant role in Maine?s economy and New England agriculture.? ?David McCrum and Dominic Lajoie have a breadth of knowledge and experience that will benefit Maine?s potato industry, particularly in promoting the high value seed potato through their service on the Board,? said Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Walt Whitcomb. ?I am pleased that they will apply their talents for the benefit of the Maine potato industry and Maine agriculture as a whole.? David McCrum Is the managing partner of Sunday River Farms LLC. In 2004, County Super Spuds purchased Arthur Ladd?s farming operation headquartered in Rumford Point, Maine to become Sunday River Farms. Sunday River Farms is part of Penobscot McCrum, one of North America?s largest suppliers of superior, value-added potato specialty products. The McCrum family represents five generations of potato farmers who began in the northern Maine town of Mars Hill. As a vertically integrated company, the McCrum family enterprise spans the entire state??specializing in every aspect of potatoes. Vertical integration allows the McCrum family to monitor quality from field to table, ensuring that the highest standards are met every step along the way. Dominic Lajoie Dominic Lajoie is part of a three-generation family organization that runs LaJoie Growers, LLC an agricultural operation in northern Aroostook County. For five generations, the LaJoie family has been producing potatoes in Van Buren, in the St. John River Valley. The company currently has approximately 1,300 acres of specialty produce and grain crops. Produce grown on the farm is suitable for different markets such as processing, chip, fresh and seed. The Maine Seed Potato Board: The Maine Seed Potato Board was established to foster and improve the seed potato industry of the State of Maine. Its primary responsibilities are to produce, or cause to be produced, through contract or otherwise, sufficient acreages of foundation seed potatoes of various varieties for distribution and sale to Maine potato growers; to work with and through the Agricultural Experiment Station of the University of Maine in conducting a program of foundation seed potatoes annually; to purchase, own, sell or convey farm real estate and farm equipment as necessary for the purpose of producing seed potatoes; and to make rules and regulations pertaining to its program of production, distribution and sales of seed potatoes. Proceeds from the sale of seed potatoes are credited to the operating account of the Board. ORGANIZATION: The Seed Potato Board was organized in Apri1 1945. It initially consisted of six members appointed by the Governor from specified areas for terms of three years, and the Commissioner of Agriculture served as chairman. A number of changes in the Board's structure have occurred since then, and the last one occurred in 2009 when the Legislature voted to transfer oversight of the Board from the Department to the Maine Potato Board. The Commissioner now serves as a member and appoints two members to include a representative of the potato industry in a county other than Aroostook County and a person producing potatoes in Aroostook County primarily for processing. The Maine Potato Board appoints six members representing the potato industry in Aroostook County and to include one grower producing primarily tablestock potatoes and another grower producing potatoes primarily for processing. PROGRAM: The Board carries out its mission through the operation of a foundation seed potato production facility known as the Porter Farm in Masardis, Maine. Over 200 different varieties are maintained in a tissue culture bank and nearly sixty varieties of seed potatoes are produced in the fields each year. The facility is equipped with tissue culture production, disease testing laboratories, seed storages with climate control systems, greenhouses and an irrigation system to support the production of nuclear and foundation seed. In 2009, the Board began producing minitubers in a state of the art greenhouse using hydroponics that allowed them to produce high quality minitubers at very competitive prices. It also enabled them to increase the volume of seed at a much faster rate to meet growing demands for new varieties. Volunteers Wanted for Landowner Appreciation Cleanup Day, Saturday, September 13 September 8, 2014 For more information contact: Jeff Currier at: (207) 827-1800, cell 441-2580 AUGUSTA- Landowner Appreciation Cleanup Day is September 13. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Bureau of Forestry is coordinating the volunteer land cleanup effort this year. Forest Rangers working in cooperation with the Maine Snowmobile Association (MSA), ATV Maine, and the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (IFW), as well as other recreational groups, are preparing teams to clean up 50-60 illegal dump sites in Maine. In other parts of the country, most undeveloped forest land is posted, and recreation is limited to those who pay club fees to use locations. Maine landowners have a history of sharing their forest and farm lands for responsible outdoor recreation. Millions of acres of working farms and forests are open to the public for enjoyment throughout the year. Unfortunately, the Maine privilege of enjoying access to private lands is threatened every time irresponsible people litter or illegally dump trash. ?Landowner Appreciation Cleanup Day is a way to thank property owners for allowing access to private lands for outdoor activities, recreation and enjoyment,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Most Maine people understand that public access to private lands is a special privilege to be respected and cherished, not a right. I commend volunteers and landowners alike for promoting public access and awareness of the need to respect private property.? Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb urged outdoor enthusiasts and organizations to support the effort by volunteering their time and energy. ?Department staff and our partner organizations have worked hard to make this annual effort a success,? he said. ?It is also symbolic of efforts made throughout the year by people and individuals to help ensure future access to private lands by keeping them clear of trash and debris. The goal is to avoid the posting of ?no trespassing? signs and the installation of gates that block access.? The Forestry staff, in cooperation with other state agencies and outdoor recreational groups, has been working with landowners to identify specific dump locations and enter them into a database to track progress on site cleanup. It will supply trucks and trash bags for the cleanup effort, but needs volunteers to help load the items. Dump sites vary from a single piece of discarded furniture, a washing machine or discarded tires to several pickup-truck loads of shingles and mattresses. To make it easier for cleanup volunteers, dozens of maps have been created that show the exact dump site locations. Cleanup volunteers who live near an illegal dump site may have to spend only a half hour or less to help clean it up. Locations around Maine: [https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?hl=en&authuser=0&mid=zoiiBuAdliI.kt9l_dw1qAg](https://mapsengine.google.com/map/edit?hl=en&authuser=0&mid=zoiiB_uAdliI.kt9_l_dw1qAg) To volunteer for this project, please contact Jeff Currier at (207) 827-1800, or the Maine Forest Service at 1-800-750-9777. New Mapping Tool Available to Prepare for Hurricanes September 10, 2014 For more information contact: Peter Slovinsky, Maine Geological Survey (207) 287-7173 Lynette Miller ? Maine Emergency Management Association (207) 624-4420 Elizabeth Hertz ? Municipal Planning Assistance Program (207) 287-8061 at: AUGUSTA- The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s (DACF) Bureau of Resource Information and Land Use Planning is making available a valuable planning tool to assist local, regional and state emergency management officials in preparing for hurricanes. The Bureau?s Maine Geological Survey, with funding from the Maine Floodplain Management Program through a grant from FEMA, has created a Potential Hurricane Inundation Map (PHIM) series that can be accessed online. Release of an online mapping tool, accessible through the Maine Geological Survey?s website, coincides with today?s date ? September 10 - the statistical peak of the Atlantic Basin?s hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to November 30. The PHIMs show areas along the Maine coastline that might potentially be flooded by storm tides (the combination of a predicted tide and storm surge) under scenarios of Category 1 or 2 storms making landfall at either mean tide or mean high tide. The maps also show an additional 20% potential flooding uncertainty band associated with each scenario. The PHIMs can be used to improve emergency preparedness and planning by helping identify vulnerable critical public infrastructure at the local, county, and state level. The maps were created using the National Hurricane Center?s Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model in addition to newly available highly accurate topographic data of Maine?s coastline. ?This is an excellent planning tool for local, regional and state emergency management professionals,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?The ability to predict which parts of our coastline might be inundated by storm tides associated with hurricanes can help Maine communities plan for and respond to hurricane-related emergencies. This new mapping tool has the potential to save lives and limit property damage.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb stressed that PHIM maps are the latest example of the type of work DACF scientists and educators do every day to plan for weather impact on our natural resources. ?The Maine Geological Survey has worked hard with our partners to create a useful planning tool that will be helpful at all levels? he said. ?PHIM is designed specifically for emergency management and planning, but highlights how the DACF is using cutting-edge technologies to help Maine communities meet the challenges of weather on natural resource management.? Although the threat in Maine is generally small compared with southern New England states, hurricanes can and do happen in Maine. Luckily, Maine sits at the ?tail end? of tropical events. Due to the colder Gulf of Maine waters and its geographic location, most hurricanes that cross into Maine have made landfall elsewhere and either weakened to tropical storms or become extra-tropical. Since records were started in 1842, only five hurricanes have made landfall along the Maine coastline as either Category 1 or 2 storms; the most recent was Hurricane Bob in 1991. However, many of these events have still caused extensive damage, injuries and even deaths. It is the responsibility of local, regional and state governments to be prepared for and respond to these events, and the PHIM series is meant to help all levels of government achieve that goal. For more information, see the Maine Geological Survey?s Potential Hurricane Inundation Map website and Overland Hurricanes NOAA Historical Hurricane Tracking Tool: [http://csc.noaa.gov/hurricanes/#](http://csc.noaa.gov/hurricanes/#) Important Note: Potential Hurricane Inundation Maps are emergency preparedness and planning documents for events that don?t have occurrence probabilities. They are not intended to be used for regulatory or insurance purposes. THE EASTERN STATES EXPOSITION ?BIG E?

These awards will provide planning and design support for harbor management, infrastructure and public access along the Maine coast. The grants are made possible by Maine?s federal coastal management award from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The grant program, an important component of the Maine Coastal Program, balances the development and conservation of Maine?s coastal zone by providing technical assistance to coastal municipalities for planning and public access. Each grantee will provide a minimum of 25% in matching funds or services. ?Commercial and public access to Maine?s coastline is important for fisherman, businesses that rely on tourism and public enjoyment of our natural resources,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?These projects will promote local access and economic activity along the Maine coast.? ?The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry partners with many communities to improve coastal access for commercial and recreational users,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Our Maine Coastal Program Grants help provide communities with technical assistance, infrastructure design and expanded access to Maine?s coastal resources.? Grants were awarded as follows: Town of Chebeague Island: $20,000 for the assessment of a town-owned coastal parcel called Sunset Landing for its potential future use. The Town has already completed an initial phase of the project, and it will use this funding to complete the second phase, which includes a bathymetric survey, eel grass survey, wind-wave vulnerability analysis, and archaeological investigations. This information, displayed on a composite map, will allow the Town to present options to residents in a public process, and ultimately determine the best use for Sunset Landing. Town of Richmond: $7,239 for the planning and design of a pedestrian walkway to connect public access to Richmond?s waterfront. The Town will use the funding for engineering and design services along with boundary and legal work to obtain an easement and plan and design a walking path that will link two important public access sites along the Kennebec River that serve this coastal community: Richmond Town Waterfront and Swan Island State Boat Launch. City of Rockland: $15,000 for design and engineering to improve Rockland Public Pier. The City will solicit bids for engineering and design services to facilitate the improvement of this pier that was built in 1935 and serves the Midcoast region of Maine, where there is ever-growing demand for these public assets. Working with the Harbor Commission and the Harbor Park Redesign Committee, the City will integrate the new design for Rockland Public Pier with plans for Harbor Park, allowing both community facilities to continue to serve the public in the future. City of Rockland: $10,000 for planning new technology improvements and a dredge survey for Rockland Fish Pier. The City will contract for engineering services to survey around the pier in order to confirm and clarify costs for future dredging, which will be part of a larger plan to make significant capital improvements to Rockland Fish Pier. The City will also hire a consultant to investigate and advise on other possible upgrades to the pier, including new equipment such as hoists, energy efficient freezers, or even new technologies that may be employed to reduce fish odor and nuisance. This pair of assessments will allow the City to improve the overall Fish Pier facility and secure its future providing critical public access for the lobster and commercial fisheries while balancing the needs of other users. This is the ninth round of Shore and Harbor Planning Grant solicitations. Since 2006, 59 grants have been awarded for a total of $766,949.

With moose hunting season underway, Governor Paul R. LePage is urging Maine hunters to consider supporting the Hunters for the Hungry Program by donating all or part of their harvest to feed families in need. The popular program provides a means for Maine hunters, as well as hunters from other states, to donate harvested game to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households with a medical need. ?The Hunters for the Hungry Program is a way that Maine hunters can pursue a sport they love and help their neighbors at the same time,? said Governor LePage. ?The donation of one moose can provide 200 to 500 pounds of meat to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households across the state. The fact that this program has grown so steadily is both a testament to the need and the generosity of Mainers.? Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb noted that since its establishment in 1996, the Hunters for the Hungry Program has provided thousands of nutritious meals to people across the state. ?Since 1996, Maine sportsmen and women have contributed to a program that provides nutritious meals to people across Maine,? said Whitcomb. ?The Hunters for the Hungry Program puts high quality, native protein on the tables of Maine families.? The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry distributes many types of donations to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households with a medical need. The Hunters for the Hungry Program is part of the Department?s Emergency Food Assistance Program. It is done in cooperation with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife?s wardens, Maine State Troopers and hunters, are all working towards a common goal of helping fellow Mainers. The program accepts bear, deer and moose donations. Road kill donations are also accepted, provided the meat is not damaged. Hunters do not pay for the processing of donated meat. Meat processing costs are paid for by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry or the charity that receives the food. Hunters choosing to keep their game can still donate a few pounds to the program. Meat processors that are interested in getting involved with the program and learning how it works should call 207-287-7513.

Supporting documents USDA Specialty Crop Block Grants Create New Economic Opportunities and Grow Markets for Local Producers October 9, 2014 For more information contact: Jessica Nixon at: 207-287-3494 Augusta ? Commissioner Walter Whitcomb announced that Maine is partnering with USDA Specialty Crop Block Grant Program to invest $602,678.57 to support Maine Specialty Crop Producers. Maine will conduct 10 initiatives to increase the competitiveness of Maine specialty crops by: enhancing and strengthening markets for specialty crops such as potatoes, wild blueberries, maple syrup, and other fruits and vegetables; investigating the health of honey bees; increasing the nutrition knowledge and consumption of specialty crops by Maine children and adults; and furthering the development of a hops industry to complement Maine?s craft beer industry. ?The last Census of Agriculture found that the market value of Maine agricultural products has increased 24 %,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?This includes a significant increase in value for Maine specialty crops like blueberries and potatoes. The investments we are making will help strengthen markets for Maine grown crops and support continued growth of our natural resource economy.? \"These investments will benefit Maine farmers and consumers by funding research and marketing that is critical to the growth of Maine specialty crops,? said Commissioner Whitcomb. ?Selected projects will help growers make food safety enhancements, solve research needs for better pest management, make better informed decisions to increase profitability and sustainability and encourage the next generation to enter into commercial agriculture enterprises. Maine?s Specialty Crop Block Grant Program for 2014 supports projects that: - Support Maine Specialty Crop Producers with Food Safety Audit Preparation - Increase the Nutrition Knowledge and Consumption of Specialty Crops by Maine Children and Adults - Enhance Consumer and Producer Awareness of Maine Maple Syrup - Improve Maine Potato Yields through Increased Rotation Lengths and Improved Rotation Crop Profitability - Support Maine Potato Integrated Pest Management - Enhance the Competitiveness of New England Specialty Crops through Regional Collaboration - Investigate Honeybee Exposure to Pesticides in Maine ? The question about Neonicotinoids - Increase the Food Safety Margin of Wild Blueberries through Improved Intervention Measures - Improve Integrated Pest Management Practices for Maine Wild Blueberry Growers - Build a Hops Industry in Maine Since 2006, the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, which is administered by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has awarded close to $3 million dollars to the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to support the growing number of Maine specialty crop producers who are selling into local and regional markets. Visit [http://www.ams.usda.gov/scbgp](http://www.ams.usda.gov/scbgp) to read the 2014 project summaries and view a list of awards by location. PROJECT ABSTRACTS: Supporting Maine Specialty Crop Producers with Food Safety Audit Preparation To maintain and/or grow their markets, many Maine Specialty Crop Producers need to successfully be annually audited for Food Safety with GAP/GHP; Produce GAP?s Harmonized; or other third party audits. rowers need and want assistance preparing for these audits. AgMatters LLC will hold group meetings and one-on-one meetings with growers in order to assist with this transition of audit expectations. They have many years of experience working with The Maine Vegetable and Small Fruit Growers Association and the Maine Pomological Society promoting food safety with specialty crop growers and markets in Maine. Some Maine food hubs are beginning to ask for this certification as well. It takes a great deal of time, effort and investment for growers to meet these expectations. This grant will enable AgMatters LLC to assist a minimum of 30 specialty crop growers as they tackle the Food Safety Audits that their markets demand. Success will be measured by the number of growers who are assisted with audit preparation and their feedback. Project Partner Organization: AgMatters LLC will establish an agreement or contractual agreement with the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to lead and execute this project. Increasing the Nutrition Knowledge and Consumption of Specialty Crops by Maine Children and Adults Nutritious and delicious specialty crops are being produced in every county of our state, but without nutrition education in the classroom and awareness building provided through school gardens many citizens will never purchase them. Maine Agriculture in the Classroom (MAITC), Maine School Garden Network (MSGN), and FoodCorps will partner to educate Maine schoolchildren, teachers, parents and volunteers about specialty crops. The project will provide ready to use classroom lessons for teachers, hands-on experiential learning in the garden and direct links to Maine?s specialty crop producers. The effect will be increased consumption of specialty crops in the school cafeterias and purchase from local farmers? markets, farm stands and grocery stores. Schools across Maine are initiating school garden programs (112 participate in the MSGN registry). Less than 5% of these schools currently have any staff that is compensated for work in these gardens. The FoodCorp program has assisted schools across the state since 2011 in garden education and local food procurement. MSGN provides monthly newsletters, easy to access information on the website, and school garden visits by the coordinator to answer questions and establish links to specialty crop farmers in the area. MAITC provides lessons, fieldtrips and professional development for classroom teachers. This project will help prepare the next generation to purchase more of Maine?s specialty crops, cook and preserve them in their kitchens and integrate them into everyday healthy meals. Enhancing Consumer and Producer Awareness of Maine Maple Syrup In 2013, Maine produced 450,000 gallons of syrup making it the third largest producing state in the United States. The value of this syrup is $23.9 million and is calculated with the understanding that Maine sells about 90% of its crop as bulk syrup rather than retail. Maine increased its numbers of licensed maple syrup producers from 349 in 2011 to 452 in 2014. Maple syrup production is expanding rapidly as both a commodity crop for some producers, and an integral economic addition for diversified Maine farm businesses. To capture the full retail value of the syrup, producers must address three components of retail excellence: the quality, safety and desirability of consuming maple syrup. Posters, rack cards, flyers, recipe booklets, media posts and marketing directed to the public will enable this. In addition to events aimed at the public, producers will receive educational assistance about proper food safety and certification processes to ensure that the highest quality products can be promoted to the public. Improving Maine Potato Yields through Increased Rotation Lengths and Improved Rotation Crop Profitability. Potato producers in Maine are in need of mechanisms in which to improve potato yields in order to sustain market viability. One such mechanism, as identified by the Maine potato industry?s ?Yield Initiative Taskforce,? is through the lengthening of rotations (increasing the time between potato croppings on a piece of land). Economic challenges arise under this scenario in Maine due to increasing times between potatoes (typically the main cash crop), lack of crop diversity in current potato-cropping portfolios, and, lastly, a lack of identified potential alternative crops, alternative markets for existing crops, and value-added processing potentials for new and existing rotation crops. The goal of this project is to identify potential crops that could be grown in conjunction with potatoes that would allow producers improved economic returns, allowing growers to expand current rotation lengths while directly and indirectly improving potato yields. Through the iterative process of identifying climate suitable alternative crops, their market potential, value-added potential, and effects upon potatoes, we seek to improve the overall sustainability of the Maine potato industry for the coming years. Maine Potato Integrated Pest Management The management of insects, diseases, and other pests is integral in sustaining the $500 million Maine potato industry. Without reliable and sustainable pest management strategies, potato growers face the potential for severe crop losses resulting in significant reductions in profits and threats to long-term viability. To ensure an adequate response to the pest-related hazards confronting potato growers, the University of Maine Cooperative Extension Potato Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program will provide support through field monitoring, disease forecasting, and distribution of educational materials. The program will employ 10 seasonal aides, maintain 200 specialized insect traps, coordinate a statewide network of electronic weather stations, and survey 75 potato fields on a weekly basis. Applied research regarding late blight spore morality and fungicide residual will aid in the development of a late blight decision support system and information delivery will be enhanced through the development of a late blight smartphone app. The economic impact of the Potato IPM Program on the Maine potato industry has averaged nearly $14 million for the past five years. With continued funding this program will provide growers with current information on specific and timely pest management strategies in order to minimize pesticide applications and maximize potato yield. Enhancing the Competitiveness of New England Specialty Crops through Regional Collaboration The Harvest New England Association, Inc., (HNE), established in 1992, is the only regional marketing association comprised of the New England State Departments of Agriculture. This wholesale-driven project, completed over three years, has three components which work towards the overall goal of increasing purchases and sales of regional specialty crops by New England wholesalers and increased awareness of regional specialty crops by consumers. The projects are responding to needs expressed by the industry and the continued need for consumer education on the availability of New England grown specialty crops. The importance of regional wholesale buying for the purposes of sales to school, institutions, and restaurants is ever present and an increasing priority for each of the New England states. Producers, consumers, and wholesalers now need the education and the knowledge to advance to the next level. This will be accomplished by increasing the marketing skills, networking, public awareness, and buying opportunities of New England specialty crops. Project Partner Organization: Harvest New England through the Connecticut Department of Agriculture Honeybee Exposure to Pesticides in Maine ? The question about Neonicotinoids Neonicotinoid insecticides are commonly used for control of many insect pests in several important Specialty Crops grown in Maine. These insecticides are relatively inexpensive, highly effective in controlling pests, provide persistent control, and have low human toxicity, as far as known. However, neonicotinoid insecticides are banned in many countries in the European Union (Stafford 2013), some landscapes in Canada, and are considered in some US states for a ban. In fact, in the fall of 2013 a bill was introduced into the Maine legislature to ban neonicotinoids temporarily in Maine. This bill was withdrawn before debate. This class of insecticides has been implicated in honeybee colony collapse and other deleterious effects on honeybees and some native bee declines. Bee pollinators are extremely important to the production of many Specialty Crops grown in Maine, specifically the small fruit, tree fruit and the cucurbit crops. However, the data is far from conclusive that these insecticides are the cause of honeybee declines. This is NOT to say that these insecticides are not harming bees. However, in Maine there is almost NO DATA on the exposure that honeybees experience with neonicotinoid insecticides, or for that matter any pesticides. The intent of this proposal is to collect data on honeybee exposure so that informed decisions can be made regarding bee exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides AND other pesticides in different regions and landscapes in Maine. An informed decision on risk due to pesticides cannot be made without information on potential exposure. Quantifiable exposure rate is the FUNDAMENTAL basis for all toxicological risk assessment. Increasing the Food Safety Margin of Wild Blueberries through Improved Intervention Measures The Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine proposes using $56,875 in Specialty Crop Block Grant (SCBG) funding for the project ?Increasing the Food Safety Margin of Wild Blueberries through Improved Intervention Measures?. Dr. Vivian Wu, University of Maine Professor of Microbiology and Food Safety, will conduct research to develop effective intervention technologies using chemical washing (chlorine, chlorine dioxide (ClO2), lactic acid, and ozone) to reduce microbial loading on frozen processed wild blueberries. This proposal is expected to develop outcomes that increase the margin of food safety for Maine wild blueberries that will protect the consumer and the economic wellbeing of Maine?s 510 growers and the $250 million economic contribution of wild blueberries to the Maine economy. We propose to evaluate efficacy of sanitizers at short contact times in inactivating inoculated foodborne pathogens from the surface of wild blueberries. Blueberries will be inoculated with a pathogen cocktail. Individual chemical sanitizers and/or combinations will be applied with single spray or double spray equipment on the surface of berries. Treated blueberry samples will be frozen storage at -15?C for 1 week. Bacterial enumeration will be conducted. Expected results from enumeration should show a 5 log CFU (colony forming unit) pathogenic reduction when the optimal sanitation spraying system is established and spray sanitation measure is coupled with freezing. Successful outcomes of the project will provide wild blueberry processors with effective intervention methods to increase the food safety margin of the crop. Improving Integrated Pest Management Practices for Maine Wild Blueberry Growers The Wild Blueberry Commission (WBC) proposes to develop and implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) program for weeds, diseases and insects for Maine?s 510 wild blueberry growers. This project will address acute, emerging, and important crop management needs that threaten Maine wild blueberry production by developing IPM program activities. If IPM practices and enhancements are not developed to address these challenges Maine?s 84.7 million pound wild blueberry crop, $64.7 million farm gate revenue and $250 million in annual Maine economic impact are at significant risk. This IPM program will conservatively prevent $32 million in annual grower revenue losses. This integrated proposal contains three focus areas. First: Evaluate herbicides with different modes of action to effectively control resistant weeds; Develop effective weed resistance strategies and educate growers on weed resistance management. Second: Use weather station network data and applied research to provide growers with disease forecasts to reduce crop loss and fungicide use; develop new IPM disease and insect management enhancements including: conduct a fungicide evaluation studies to provide data on mummy berry, Botrytis blossom blight, and leaf spot diseases to reduce fungicide resistance; and predictions on emergence of Spotted Wing Drosophila and Blueberry Fruit Fly. Third: Develop an IPM program for blueberry tip midge and determine the impact of wild blueberry damage from sap feeding insects resulting from current fertility and disease management practice. Building a Hops Industry in Maine Maine is a national leader in production of craft beers, yet most of this product is brewed from imported ingredients. Brewers have expressed a strong desire to brew their products with local hops, but presently there is little growing capacity for hops in Maine on a commercial scale. Development of a successful hops industry requires that we study which varieties are best adapted to Maine?s climate, and which have the most desirable brewing characteristics. Of special concern is resistance to downy mildew, a potentially devastating disease of hops plants. We will plant twelve varieties of hops at the Agricultural Experiment Station in Monmouth, and evaluate growth characteristics, including plant survival, productivity and disease resistance, such as tolerance to downy mildew. The varieties will be evaluated for brewing and flavoring qualities at the Food Science Laboratory at the University of Maine in Orono. Interested growers and brewers will visit the trials and learn appropriate growing techniques, pest management strategies and variety characteristics. Results will be shared with growers and brewers through workshops, fact sheets and videos posted online.

Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) officials are highlighting the important work of Maine Soil and Water Conservation Districts in speeches in Skowhegan and Gorham this week. Commissioner Walt Whitcomb and Deputy Commissioner Dave Lavway are scheduled to speak at meetings of the Maine State Grange and Cumberland County Soil & Water Conservation District about the value of Conservation districts to Maine communities, agriculture and the natural resource economy. ?The last Census of Agriculture highlighted the strength of Maine agriculture and its potential to put more food on the table, provide jobs and create economic opportunities,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?There are more Maine farms now, and the market value of Maine agricultural products has increased 24 percent. Soil and Water Conservation Districts are an important part of that success. For the amount of money invested, Conservation Districts provide taxpayers with the biggest bang for the buck in natural resource management. The valuable work that they do does not receive enough attention or financial support.? ?Maine needs to develop its natural resources economy through prevention of soil erosion, improvement of soil health, protection and restoration of water quality, and wise use of our land, forests, and water,? said DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Meeting these challenges requires a public-private partnership that Conservation Districts have developed over the past 70 years. The LePage Administration has actively strengthened an important partnership that improves natural resource management.? Speaking to the Cumberland County Soil & Water Conservation District (Cumberland SWCD), Deputy DACF Commissioner Dave Lavway congratulated the district for its nationally recognized program for urban stormwater management and transformation into the largest and most successful Conservation District in New England. ?Agriculture is growing in Cumberland County, with more farms and more acres devoted to producing locally-grown food with sustainable farming practices,? said Deputy Commissioner Lavway. ?Cumberland SWCD has recognized this trend and is developing programs to promote soil health and public awareness of agriculture.? Benefits of Soil and Water Conservation Districts: Soil & Water Conservation districts help prevent of soil erosion, improve soil health, protect and restore water quality. They promote wise use of land, forest and water resources. They achieve these objectives by establishing public-private partnerships. Conservation Districts bring numerous partners together: federal and state agencies, local governments, farmers, woodlot owners, lakeshore residents, business and industry ? to find effective solutions to local natural resource problems. Soil & Water Conservation Districts are important partners in the merged Department of Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry. They epitomize the collaborative approach to natural resource management that Governor LePage envisioned when he and the Legislature combined three agencies into Maine?s largest natural resource Department. Conservation Districts extend the Department?s ability to reach local landowners. Districts are one of the most trusted sources for unbiased information on natural resource management. Maine?s Conservation Districts leverage over $15 million in grants, appropriations, cash contributions, and volunteer labor to conserve, improve, and sustain natural resources. Every State dollar invested in Conservation Districts produces over $ 18 in additional funding for conservation work.

With the second session of the 2014 moose hunting season underway, Governor Paul R. LePage is again urging Maine hunters to consider supporting the Hunters for the Hungry Program by donating all or part of their harvest to feed families in need. The popular program provides a means for Maine hunters, as well as hunters from other states, to donate harvested game to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households with a medical need. ?The Hunters for the Hungry Program is a way that Maine hunters can pursue a sport they love and help their neighbors at the same time,? said Governor LePage. ?The donation of one moose can provide 200 to 500 pounds of meat to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households across the state. The fact that this program has grown so steadily is both a testament to the need and the generosity of Mainers.? Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb noted that since its establishment in 1996, the Hunters for the Hungry Program has provided thousands of nutritious meals to people across the state. ?Since 1996, Maine sportsmen and women have contributed to a program that provides nutritious meals to people across Maine,? said Whitcomb. ?The Hunters for the Hungry Program puts high quality, native protein on the tables of Maine families.? The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry distributes many types of donations to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households with a medical need. The Hunters for the Hungry Program is part of the Department?s Emergency Food Assistance Program. It is done in cooperation with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife?s wardens, Maine State Troopers and hunters, are all working towards a common goal of helping fellow Mainers. The program accepts bear, deer and moose donations. Road kill donations are also accepted, provided the meat is not damaged. Hunters do not pay for the processing of donated meat. Meat processing costs are paid for by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry or the charity that receives the food. Hunters choosing to keep their game can still donate a few pounds to the program. Meat processors that are interested in getting involved with the program and learning how it works should call 207-287-7513.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s State Veterinarian and Director of Animal Welfare are urging Mainers to take the time and care worthy of this significant and potentially rewarding step when considering obtaining a new pet. ?Healthy pets make happy owners. We want all Mainers to have a positive experience adopting a new family member,? noted Maine State Veterinarian, Dr. Michele Walsh. ?Obtaining a pet is a significant emotional and economic commitment. Taking a few additional steps up front will help ensure that a new pet is healthy and well-adjusted, and can prevent disappointment down the road.? By doing some important but basic research ahead of time, Mainers can help ensure the animal they are adopting is healthy and the animal organization with which they are working is compliant with Maine laws designed to protect consumers. Paying close attention to these details can increase the likelihood that new pets will bring many years of enjoyment. ?Research the group claiming to be rescuing the animals. Some groups disappear after getting the money and offer no support if there are behavior issues or illness,? said Liam Hughes, Director of Maine?s Animal Welfare Program. ?Do not pay cash, adopt, or buy a pet in a parking lot or on the side of a road. When you do get a new pet, take it to the vet right away. Start to build a relationship with your pet?s healthcare provider and make sure your new pet is really healthy.? Cautionary Tale: In October, two dogs on a shipment of rescue animals imported to New England from the southern U.S. became very ill from canine parvovirus infection, which is highly contagious. When New England state regulators attempted to identify the whereabouts of all potentially exposed dogs to limit the spread of infection, poor or inaccurate adoption/distribution records for the animals prevented timely notification of the new owners or foster homes. This resulted in unnecessary exposure of additional animals to this terrible disease and substantial veterinary fees. If all importing groups had followed the laws in place to prevent such spread of disease ? which include vaccination against diseases like parvovirus 14 days prior to importation - a lot of heartache and cost of treatment would be spared. Fortunately, many groups ? including local humane societies, shelters, rescue organizations and breeders - do wonderful work with animals and provide excellent opportunities to meet and learn about potential new pets prior to taking them home. Interacting with animals on-site prior to adoption gives families a chance to learn about any special behavioral or health requirements the animal might have, and obtain a copy of the animal?s vaccination and health records. Reputable groups work closely with licensed veterinarians who assess the health of the animals in the facility, treat any medical issues, and spay or neuter new arrivals before they are made available for adoption. Dr. Walsh offers the following tips when adopting a new pet: - Work with a reputable local humane society whenever possible. - Meet with the pet prior to adopting it to ensure that its behavior and demeanor are a good match for your family. - Obtain a copy of the animal?s medical record, vaccination history, and Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. - Ensure that the dog or cat is vaccinated for rabies if it is three months of age or older. - If working with a rescue organization, ensure that it is properly registered and licensed in the state of Maine and in the state where the business is based, and/or with USDA Animal Care. Mainers can contact the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Animal Health office at (207) 287-3701 for more information on which animal rescue and breeding organizations are appropriately registered. How you can help fight animal cruelty and pet overpopulation in Maine: Commissioner Walt Whitcomb highlighted the role Department plays in promoting responsible pet ownership and animal welfare. ?Our ACF veterinary staff and animal welfare specialists partner with animal health professionals and animal care organizations statewide to provide advice and assistance to families adding a companion animal, but they also work to help fight animal cruelty and pet overpopulation,? said Whitcomb. ?If you?re looking for a gift idea that also contributes to animal protection, animal care license plate may be a unique present for someone you know who would like to show they also care.?

If you are seeing moth flights this time of year in Maine, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Maine Forest Service would like to know how many, what size, when and where through a simple online survey. Public assistance is being sought to help combat the destructive winter moth (Operophthera brumata) by better understanding the locations and sizes of the populations in Maine. ?The total economic impact of Maine?s forest industry is $8 billion with direct and indirect employment of 38,789 workers,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Fighting invasive insects like the winter moth is important to help protect that sector of our economy; in this case, hardwood trees and agricultural crops such as apples and blueberries. Public involvement will help professionals combat and minimize the destructive potential of this and other invasive species.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb stressed that the public can help by filling out a simple online survey set by the Department to report winter moth sightings. ?Reports from the public are critical to getting the bigger picture of this insect?s distribution,? said Whitcomb. ?A healthy forest is key to Maine?s forest economy. Having citizen involvement in monitoring invasive pests is important to the future of rural Maine.? The survey can be accessed online at: [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/wintermothsurvey](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/wintermothsurvey) Reports of moth flights can also be made by phone at (207) 287-2431. Forest Entomologist Charlene Donahue stressed that December is an important time to look for the winter moth. ?December may seem like an odd time to set up traps for a defoliating forest pest. However, the moth flies when it is dark?this time of year many of us are still out and about after dark. Even if we aren?t, we may cast a glance at our windows and notice if there are several or more small tan moths trying to get to our indoor lights. Staff has spent part of the first week of December setting up traps along the coast and inland in southern Maine. Towns in the study region are cooperating by allowing traps to be hung on municipal property. Additionally two homeowners in the most heavily infested areas have volunteered their services to make nightly counts of the moths trapped in their yards.? The winter moth was introduced into North America from Europe in the early part of the last century. It was first seen in Nova Scotia in the 1930s and then in the Pacific Northwest (British Columbia, Oregon and Washington) in the 1970?s. Winter moth showed up in eastern Massachusetts in the early 2000?s and has since spread westward in MA, into Rhode Island and now coastal Maine from Kittery to Bar Harbor. It was first reported in Maine in significant numbers in December 2011. The larvae (caterpillars) of winter moth defoliate deciduous trees and shrubs such as oaks, maples, apples and blueberries, in early spring. Heavy defoliation for several consecutive years leads to branch dieback and tree mortality. Winter moth defoliation has contributed to tens of thousands of acres of oak mortality in Massachusetts. Winter moth defoliation was first recorded in Maine in 2012. 2014 was the third year that the insect has defoliated significant areas of forest and backyard trees in Maine. Aerial survey picked up moderate to heavy defoliation in the Cumberland County towns of Cape Elizabeth, Portland (Peaks Island) and Harpswell, with just under 1900 acres mapped. On the ground, light to heavy defoliation could be seen in scattered locations from Kittery to Rockland. Adults are active from late November to January whenever the temperature is above freezing. Males are small, light brown to tan moths. They are attracted to lights and a chemical released by the females. Adult females are small and gray. They have reduced wings and are flightless. Females are most commonly found crawling at the base of trees. So if you see moths flying in December, let the Maine Forest Service know.

State officials are advising ice fishermen and snowmobilers to use extreme caution when heading out to fish this week. AWW Superintendent Matthew LaRoche warned that there is only an inch of good black ice with about 5 inches of soft snow ice on top of that. The rain that fell over the Christmas holiday has caused the lakes to rise and the ice to break away from shore in many places. There is two or three feet of open water along the edges of the lakes in most places. When rangers and wardens were out checking the ice on Monday they found the same conditions on all the lakes that were checked. There is also open water in all thoroughfares that connect the lakes. Governor Paul R. LePage urged caution on the first weekend of ice fishing season. ?This week, many Maine residents and visitors will be out snowmobiling and ice fishing to open the 2015 season,? said Governor LePage. ?Anglers should enjoy the excellent ice fishing season that begins Thursday, January 1, but exercise caution regarding ice conditions. Please take precautions so that your Maine ice fishing experience is not only memorable for the fish you catch, but also for the positive memories you make with family and friends.? AWW Superintendent LaRoche warned all visitors to stay away from thoroughfares avoid tributary streams when traveling on the ice. ?An inch of good ice isn?t very much, and that thickness may vary from location to location,? LaRoche said. ?The ice is just not safe enough to cross any of the waterway headwater lakes yet.? He urged those heading out on the ice to stay near shore, play it safe and check the ice in the area in which they are traveling before venturing out onto the ice. For specific advice on ice conditions and areas to avoid, visitors should check with the ranger at Chamberlain Bridge or call the dispatch center in Ashland between 8 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday through Friday, at 207-435-7963, extension 1. The AWW provides: winter campgrounds at the Chamberlain Bridge and Kellogg Brook; public drinking water, vault toilets and snow plowing. A groomed snowmobile trail is marked from the Chamberlain Bridge parking lot to the south end of Chamberlain Lake and to Round Pond/Telos lakes. The AWW is a 92-mile-long ribbon of lakes, ponds, streams, and river that wind through the heart of northern Maine?s vast commercial forest. The waterway became the first state-administered river to be designated by the United States Department of Interior as a component of the federal Wild and Scenic River Program. This designation was the culmination of an effort began in the early 1960s to protect the outstanding natural character, unique recreational opportunities, and historical significance of the Allagash River and its associated lakes and ponds.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Maine Geological Survey reports that the Cooperative Snow Survey results for February 2015 show high water content in Maine?s snowpack, with results in the upper range of measurements conducted over the last 10 years. Key findings of the February survey: Snow depths and water content have increased significantly since the January survey. Five sites in Maine report over 30 inches of snow A dozen sites recorded over six inches of water content. Highest water content was reported in northern Somerset and Franklin Counties. The map of water content for February shows about 3-5 inches of water in the snow in southern, central and northern Maine. The snowpack in eastern Maine has slightly higher water content, and the greatest water content in this survey is in the western mountains to the Canadian border. There has been a significant increase in water content of the snowpack since January, mostly in southern and eastern Maine. Compared to the last 10 years, much of the water content in the snowpack around the state is in the upper 25% of measurements, except for northernmost Maine and the western foothills, where the water content is normal. It is important to note that historically, snowmelt alone has not resulted in significant flooding. However, snowmelt was a significant contributor to rain events that caused major flooding on the Kennebec River in 1987 and on the St. John River at Fort Kent in 2008. The Maine Cooperative Snow Survey: The Maine Cooperative Snow Survey collects, interprets, and distributes information on the depth and water content of Maine's snowpack in the late Winter and early Spring, when the danger of flooding in Maine's rivers and streams is greatest. The snow survey is conducted each winter beginning in January with monthly measurements. In March, weekly measurements begin which continue until snow melt is complete. The survey data is analyzed by staff from the Maine Geological Survey and U.S. Geological Survey, and maps are prepared showing the water content in snowpack for the State. This information is transmitted to the National Weather Service (NWS) for use in preparing flood potential statements and running flood forecast models. In the event of a significant flood, the NWS would use the data to refine its estimates of flood crests. The data are also distributed to the Maine Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) and, through MEMA, to county emergency management officials. Posted on the MEMA website are maps showing water content in snowpack, changes in water content from the preceding survey, snowpack depth, snowpack density, water content in snowpack compared to historical values, and mean water content in Maine drainage basins. Also posted is table of snow survey sites with current readings listed. The snow survey for February was completed during the week of February 2, and the final maps are available at: [http://www.maine.gov/rfac/rfac_snow.shtml](http://www.maine.gov/rfac/rfac_snow.shtml) The Maine Cooperative Snow Survey is coordinated jointly by the Maine Geological Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey, in cooperation with: - ALLAGASH WILDERNESS WATERWAY - BROOKFIELD RENEWABLE POWER, INC - COBBOSSEE WATER DISTRICT - COLLEGE OF THE ATLANTIC - MAINE FOREST SERVICE - MINISTERE DE L' ENVIRONNEMENT QUEBEC - NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE - NESTLE - POLAND SPRING WATER COMPANY - CANADIAN PROVINCE OF NEW BRUNSWICK - NEW HAMPSHIRE DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES - POLAND REGIONAL HIGH SCHOOL - SAPPI LIMITED More information on the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry is available at: [http://www.maine.gov/dacf](http://www.maine.gov/dacf) Maine agricultural officials report record interest in obtaining licenses to sell dairy products March 4, 2015 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 AUGUSTA ? The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Division of Quality Assurance and Regulations reports record interest on the part of Maine farms to obtain licenses to sell retail dairy products. Recent requests for inspections and inquiries clearly points to a substantial increase in the number of licenses to sell dairy products from the current number of 134. The recent interest comes on the heels of explosive growth in the number of operations producing artisanal cheese and raw milk products. Department officials report that seventeen (17) farms have expressed enough interest in obtaining a license to contact dairy inspectors and have an inspection done. An additional twenty (20) have made inquiries, but have not yet scheduled an inspection. The retail dairy licenses involve cow, goat sheep, and water buffalo milk. Commissioner Walt Whitcomb highlighted Department support of the growth in the number of artisanal cheese and raw milk facilities. ?The DACF supports the growth of Maine?s dairy industry with technical assistance, marketing, and regulatory support,? said Whitcomb. ?While the Department does play a vital public health role, our technical assistance also is supporting the rural economic growth that is signified by the increasing number of artisanal cheese and raw milk facilities in Maine.? Benefits of Maine?s modest annual license fee: For a $25.00 annual license fee the DACF provides: Initial consult with dairy inspector with facility and set up advice Large packet of information mailed with copies of all information needed Monthly analysis and reports of all products made Multiple facility inspections every year Equipment inspections for those who heat-treat or pasteurize Water testing Free lab testing to identify sanitation problems or quality issues (in addition to monthly product testing) Access to Maine Cooperative Extension Specialists and State veterinarians for additional assistance Unlimited phone assistance from dairy inspectors and laboratory Rapid growth: In 2006, there were 15 licensed facilities that offered raw milk for sale. Today there are 54 licensed raw milk businesses in Maine. In Maine, a consumer may purchase ?not pasteurized milk? and cheeses from a farm, a farmers market or a retail establishment ? a freedom that only Maine and 11 other states provide. The number of cheese businesses has tripled in the past six years to a current total of 73 businesses offering various cheeses for sale. According to a University of Vermont study, Maine is the fastest growing artisan cheese producing state in the country, trailing only New York in terms of the number of licensed artisan cheese makers. Maine dairy goat farms increased from 17 in 2008, to 46 in 2014. This is in addition to fluid milk sales from 300 dairy farms to producers totaled $140 million.

March 16, 2015 For more information contact: Samantha Howard at: 297-287-7620 The flow of maple sap surely means spring is on the way AUGUSTA ? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb invites families to visit over 100 Maine sugarhouses open to the public this Sunday, March 22, as part of Maine Maple Sunday. The annual event, held every fourth Sunday in the month of March, will take place for the 32nd time. Participating sugarhouses will be open for visitors to enjoy freshly made maple syrup and candy, demonstrations of syrup production, sugarbush tours and a variety of other family activities. On March 10, Governor Paul R. LePage highlighted the start of Maine?s maple season by tapping a maple tree on the Blaine House lawn with legislators and representatives from the Maine Maple Producers Association. The Governor used the annual event to highlight the economic contributions of Maine?s maple syrup industry and its potential to create more jobs. ?This industry demonstrates the excellent opportunity Maine has to promote its natural resource-based economy, as well as to promote job creation for our citizens,? said Governor LePage. ?Maine?s maple industry contributes an estimated $27.7 million directly to the Maine economy according to a UMaine study. That study also shows that Maine?s maple industry has an annual statewide economic contribution, including multiplier effects, of an estimated $48.7 million in output, 805 full- and part-time jobs and $25.1 million in labor income.? Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb noted the support that Maine?s maple industry receives from a variety of sources. ?Governor LePage, the Legislature and the Maine Maple Producers Association have worked together to grow this industry in recognition of it significance to Maine?s rural economy,? said Commissioner Whitcomb. ?The maple industry symbolizes how Maine can have multiple uses of its natural resources, including maple syrup, wood production, recreation and open space.? The study quoted by Governor LePage was conducted by University of Maine Professor of Economics Todd Gabe and funded through a partnership between the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, University of Maine and the Maine Maple Producers Association. Other key findings of the study: Maine has the third largest maple industry in the United States. Maine?s maple industry is characterized by a relatively small number of farms accounting for the vast majority of syrup that is produced. Maine?s licensed maple syrup producers have been in operation an average of 24 years, and some of the farms spanning 3 centuries with multiple generations. Maine?s maple industry?which counts the licensed producers and sales at retail food stores and businesses impacted by Maine Maple Sunday?generates 567 full- and part-time jobs and $17.3 million in labor income. Some sugarhouses will hold events on both Saturday and Sunday.

May 14, 2015 For more information contact: Charlene Donahue at: 207-485-0960 Release of biocontrol agent designed to combat the winter moth AUGUSTA ? Starting Friday, state entomologists from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s (DACF) Bureau of Forestry will be releasing parasitic flies in an effort to try and control and minimize the damage to trees and shrubs done by the Winter Moth. The release is in collaboration with Dr. Joseph Elkinton, University of Massachusetts Professor of Entomology and the effort is funded by the United States Department of Agriculture?s Forest Service (USDA-FS). Up to 2,000 parasitic flies (Cyzenis albicans) will be released, late morning, on Peaks Island Friday, May 15. Spring surveys of winter moth larvae indicate that Peaks Island has high enough levels of winter moth larvae to support release parasitic flies. Department professionals are checking to see if there are high enough levels of winter moth larvae to support additional releases at Two Lights State Park (Cape Elizabeth). ?The use of this biocontrol agent is part of a long-term approach to limiting the damage caused by the winter moth,? Maine Governor Paul R. LePage said. ?Department entomologists are hard at work taking steps to protect our natural resource economy from invasive pests like the winter moth, which can also damage blueberry, apple and cranberry crops.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb highlighted the collaborative approach being taken between Maine, Massachusetts and the USDA-FS. ?We thank USDA-FS, Dr. Elkington and the University of Massachusetts for collaborating with us on the timely release of these flies,? said Whitcomb. A citizen supported winter moth survey and trapping by the Maine Forest Service in December indicated winter moth could be found from Kittery to Bar Harbor. Unlike some of the other invasive insects on our doorstep, this one has a potential biocontrol agent that can hopefully control the insects spread and limit future damage. Department entomologists and volunteers will monitor the winter moth and fly populations over the next several years to see how the release is working. Winter Moth: The winter moth is the latest invasive insect to attack Maine forests, with defoliation of oak, apple, birch, maple and other hardwood trees and shrubs. It made its first appearance in Harpswell in 2012 on 400 acres. In 2013, there were over 5,000 acres of defoliation, primarily in Harpswell and Cape Elizabeth. Last year saw a bit of a reprieve after a cold December that slowed the moth mating and egg laying, but almost 2,000 acres of heavy defoliation was mapped along the coast. Winter surveys have detected winter moth from Kittery to Mount Desert Island. People frequently ask, ?Will the flies bother anything else (like people)?? The answer is no. These flies were released in Nova Scotia in the 1960s, brought the winter moth population under control and there have been no adverse effects in the intervening 50 years. Flies were also released in British Columbia again with no impacts on other insects or people. The flies are very closely tied to the winter moth life cycle and need winter moth to survive. There will always be some winter moth around, now that they have become established in Maine, but hopefully the flies will do their job and bring the winter moth population under control in a few years. It will take years before Maine will see the results of the biocontrol effort, as it takes time for the flies to become acclimated to a new location and build up their population. Once their numbers reach a high enough level, it will have a noticeable impact on the winter moth population. In the meantime people will see defoliation on hardwood trees and shrubs in May. It is hoped trees will not be too adversely effected before the parasite fly population catches up to the winter moth population and brings them into balance in Maine.

Officials at the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry (DACF) have announced that a new Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) information webpage has been created for farmers and food producers seeking information on significant federal changes to food safety regulations. \"Although the US Congress passed sweeping federal law changes 4 years ago, the rules that actually impact farmers are still being developed in Washington, DC,\" said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?This dedicated page on the DACF website provides food producers access to the most recent proposals as they are promulgated. FSMA is designed to prevent food borne illness by focusing on preventative controls and we want that information available as fast as possible. Because of the impact these federal changes will have on farmers and food businesses, we are taking steps to help ensure everyone has the latest information.? The new FSMA page created by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry will provide up-to-date information as changes occur and focus on how these changes will affect farmers and businesses. Users may utilize a tool on the site to assess any potential FSMA impact on their farm or food business. They can also sign up for email alerts as new information is released. Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) The Federal Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), signed into law in 2011, is the first significant overhaul of food safety regulations since the 1930s and was designed to prevent food borne illness. FSMA will be implemented by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](http://www.fda.gov/) and relevant state agencies. In December 2014, FDA concluded the second of two comment periods on draft rules it has written to implement the law. There are seven FSMA rules covering everything from human food to pet food to imports to transportation. Will FSMA Affect You? The webpage has a useful flowchart, developed by the [National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition](http://sustainableagriculture.net/fsma/), that helps farms and food businesses figure which rules apply to them and how. The FSMA Reproposal During the first public comment period in 2013, tens of thousands of farmers and others expressed many concerns about the produce rule impacting farms and the preventive controls rule impacting facilities that manufacture, process, pack and hold food. FDA agreed to revise specific parts of the rules to offer alternatives for provisions that raised the most concern. Maine DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb and the Department hosted a listening session with FDA officials from Washington D.C. and took them to see real Maine farms during August 2013. These sessions and farm visits provided significant input to FDA's draft rules. FSMA Updates The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Division of Quality Assurance and Regulations will continue to monitor FDA rule making and provide information at this site about FSMA next steps, including the final rules, implementation information and compliance dates, training opportunities, and whatever else small farms and food producers in Maine need to know.

Browntail moth caterpillar hairs can cause a blistery, oozy rash or respiratory distress for people who come into contact with them. Winter web surveys conducted by the DACF?s Maine Forest Service (MFS) identified extremely high levels over-wintering web in the tops of oak trees for the browntail moth caterpillar. Winter web counts were highest in parts of: - Bowdoinham, Bath, Topsham, West Bath (Sagadahoc County) Brunswick, Freeport and Harpswell (Cumberland County) this year. Browntail moth webs are also showing up in more southerly places including Cape Elizabeth, Scarborough, Westbrook, Windham, New Gloucester and Yarmouth (Cumberland County). - Pockets of infestation were also found in other coastal locations from Lincoln County, south and in inland towns such as Augusta, China, Vassalboro, Waterville (Kennebec County), Lewiston, Turner (Androscoggin County), and Whitefield (Lincoln County). One was recently found at Gardiner High School. Browntail Moth The browntail moth is an invasive species that arrived in the U.S. around 1910 on nursery stock coming from Europe. It spread through Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire and Nova Scotia before the population collapsed. The only place where it is now found in North America is the coast of Maine and Cape Cod. Browntail moth caterpillar hairs break off the caterpillars and circulate in the air. The caterpillar also molts, and the dried skin containing the hairs can drift, also causing problems for people. The hairs remain toxic for a year or more, so people still can be affected in subsequent seasons. People should take some extra precautions in areas with browntail moth infestations, especially during the late spring and summer months. These are especially important during periods of dry weather and include modifying activities that might bring you in contact with the toxic hairs of the caterpillar. A list of recommended precautions is available on the Department?s website.

June is Great Outdoors Month! AUGUSTA ? The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry? Bureau of Parks and Lands is holding a celebration at Wolfe?s Neck Woods State Park in honor of National Trails Day. The day of hiking, trail work, and outdoor activities will take place at the Park in Freeport on Saturday, June 6 beginning at 9:00 a.m. Governor Paul R. LePage has proclaimed the month of June as Great Outdoors Month and is urging residents and visitors alike to visit Maine State Parks and Historical Sites. ?Maine is blessed with outstanding opportunities for safe and healthy fun in the great outdoors,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?I am pleased to declare June, 2015 as Great Outdoors Month, and encourage residents and visitors alike to take advantage of the many outdoor experiences that make Maine unique. Outdoor recreation contributes an estimated $7.4 billion to the Maine economy and supports some 94,000 jobs.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb noted that the celebration at Wolfe?s Neck Woods State Park will provide opportunities for both seasoned outdoor enthusiasts and first-time hikers. ?Visitors will be able to explore the woods and shore of Wolfe?s Neck Woods State Park through guided nature walks led by the park staff; try their hand at trail work projects; or take part in a hands-on Leave No Trace workshop on camping skills,? said Whitcomb. ?Guided nature walks will cover a broad variety of topics. Participants may learn to identify trees, plants, and woodland wildflowers, see where different animals make their homes, search for birds, or simply enjoy the beautiful landscape of the forest and ocean. Programs are geared towards all ages.? Visitors who participate in trail work projects will learn what goes into creating and maintaining the five-mile trail system of Wolfe?s Neck Woods State Park. Projects may include rehabilitating trails that have been damaged by heavy use, or raking public areas for improved accessibility. The event will also have information about local and statewide hiking opportunities. National Trails Day: National Trails Day is a nationally recognized trail awareness program founded by the American Hiking Society that occurs annually on the first Saturday of June and inspires the public to discover, learn about, and celebrate trails while participating in outdoor activities, clinics, and trail stewardship projects.

Governor Paul R. LePage renewed his call for legislative action on his proposal to assist low-income Maine residents with high heating costs by utilizing surplus revenue from timber harvest on public lands. His appeal follows a reconciliation and re-inventory of timber production on public lands (418,572 acres) managed by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Bureau of Public Lands that showed timber growth on public lands is at or above the 180,000 cord level on an annual basis. The results of this finding were confirmed in a letter of opinion (attached) by the James W. Sewall Company of Old Town, Maine, professional foresters. Their independent review reveals that the growth rate on Bureau lands is in the range of 0.432 to 0.449 cords/acre/year, or 180,800 cords/year to 188,000 cords/year on the 418,572 acre area. The current Annual Allowable Cut (AAC) is 141,500 cords. The AAC is not the sustainable harvest level; it is the harvest level selected by Public Lands for a variety of reasons, including available harvesting contractors, existing road network, available employees, written harvest plans and revenue needs. ?This independent review reinforces that we are appropriately managing our public lands. While liberal groups have attacked our efforts to harvest our public lands this report demonstrates that we are following science to manage our lands.? said Governor LePage. ?I encourage the public to look at the facts and not follow the hollow attacks from special interest groups on our management practices.? Governor LePage?s Proposal: The Public Reserved Lands Management Fund, which receives revenue from the sale of timber from public lands, currently has a balance of roughly $8 million from higher prices for timber cut on Maine?s public lands, and a higher cut level. The result of the reconciliation and re-inventory of timber production on public lands, confirmed by an independent review, indicates that the Fund could swell even further without jeopardizing Maine?s professional forest certifications. L.D. 1397 \"An Act To Establish the Affordable Heating from Maine's Forests Fund\" allows the transfer from the current balance and future balances from the Public Reserved Lands Management Fund to Efficiency Maine Trust to lower heating costs for rural and low-income households. It requires that any transfer may not result in the loss of independent certification systems and requires that the Administration not transfer an amount that would undermine the stewardship obligations of these public reserved lands. Funding into the Public Reserved Lands Management Fund has gone up, while funding to assist households lower their heating bills is going down. Supporting documents Commissioner Whitcomb attends Maple Mania 2015 June 12, 2015 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 Highlights support for the growth of Maine?s maple industry SKOWHEGAN ? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb traveled to Skowhegan today to attend the Fifth Annual MAPLEMANIA event hosted by the Maine Maple Producers Association. The Commissioner used the event, which began Thursday night and continues to Saturday (June 13), to highlight department and administration support for the continued growth of Maine?s maple industry. Governor Paul R. LePage, who highlighted the ceremonial start of the 2015 maple season in March with the Annual Blaine House Tree Tapping event, sent his best wishes to Maine Maple Producers. ?I thank Maine?s Maple Producers for their efforts to grow the industry and for the quality products they produce around the world,? said Governor LePage. ?Maine?s maple industry contributes an estimated $27.7 million directly to the Maine economy, has an estimated annual statewide economic contribution (including multiplier effects) of $48.7 million in output, 805 full- and part-time jobs and $25.1 million in labor income. Most importantly, this industry has a huge potential for additional job creation.? In his remarks, Commissioner Whitcomb highlighted administration support for the growth of Maine?s maple industry. ?Working with the Maine Maple Producers (417 are licensed by the Department), we have increased visibility and support for Maine?s maple industry through a number of events and initiatives,? said Whitcomb. ?These include: Governor LePage?s Annual Blaine House Tree Tapping; Maine Maple Sunday (4th Sunday of every March); expanded access to tap leases on public lands (nearly 100,000) and promotional support through Get Real Get Maine. It is important to note that without maple trees, Maine?s world-renowned fall foliage season would not exist.? Maple Mania: The Maine Maple Producers Association hosts MAPLEMANIA every year. This year?s event began Thursday night, June 11 and continues to Saturday, June 13 with tours, a trade show, and technical sessions.

Visit select Maine farms this Sunday, July 26. All across the State of Maine, close to 100 family farms will open their doors to the public from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Held each year, Open Farm Day is an opportunity for consumers to learn about Maine food producers and for farms to show the public their products. ?On behalf of Maine citizens, I thank our farmers and producers for their work bringing fresh and natural products to our tables every day,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?This is an exciting time for Maine-made products and Maine agriculture. The number of Maine farms is on the rise and so is the market value of our agricultural products. Since the last Census of Agriculture, the market value of Maine?s agricultural products has increased 24%. At a time when the number of farms in the United States is declining, the number of Maine farms has increased to 8,174, up from 7,196 in 2002. This growth coincides with renewed consumer interest in locally grown foods.? Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb urged families to ?take advantage of this day to connect to life on the farm.? ?There is a story, even a lesson that surrounds all the food and other farm products that we grow right here in Maine,? said Whitcomb. ?While traveling to Maine farms on Open Farm Day, people will drive by hay fields, potato and grain fields, farm wood lots, orchards and large vegetable patches all growing crops that feed the economy before they fill dinner plates or supply other products that are important to our lives.? Open Farm Day is an annual family event that connects consumers with the men and women who help produce their food. Farms throughout Maine will open their gates to offer the public an opportunity to learn about the business of agriculture. Many farms will have demonstrations, displays, farm-raised products for sale and animals and crops to experience. Activities may include barn and field tours, milking, hay rides, petting zoos, nature trails, beautiful scenery, samples for tasting and refreshments. Events like Open Farm Day have an impact on the Agri-Tourism in the State of Maine. According to the USDA, in 2012, AG Tourism & Recreational Services in Maine increased 78% (Increasing from $1,012,000 to $1,803,000) and participating farms increased by 141% (112 to 270 farms). Now is a great time for consumers to visit and support Maine?s farms and be part of the growing support for locally grown foods. According to Gary Keough, New England Field Office State Statistician, National Agricultural Statistics Service, ?the average size of a Maine farm is 178 acres, up seven percent since 2007. Organic production and aquaculture sales increased from the last Census and the value of aquaculture sales increased from $26.3 million to $75.1 million (ranking us eighth nationally); organic products increased from $23.3 million to $36.4 million.?

This free disposal program is open to homeowners, family-owned farms and greenhouses. Collection will occur at sites located in Presque Isle, Bangor, Augusta and Portland. To qualify, people must register by September 25, 2015. Governor Paul R. LePage is urging Mainers to take advantage of this opportunity to protect the environment and save money through this once a year collection event that highlights cooperation between government agencies. ?This is an opportunity for Mainers to dispose of unusable pesticides properly and at no expense,? said Governor LePage. ?Through consolidated collections at four central locations and the use of in-house resources and expertise, disposal costs are reduced to about $2 per pound. That is a great value for Maine taxpayers which lowers costs and helps protect the environment.? It?s not unusual for homes and farms to have unintentional hazardous waste?banned pesticides or pesticides that have become caked, frozen, or otherwise rendered unusable?sitting around in basements, garages, or barns. These chemicals can be difficult and expensive to dispose of; DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb stressed the importance of proper disposal of banned or unwanted pesticides. ?It?s important for the protection of public, wildlife, and environmental health that these products are dealt with properly and not thrown in the trash or down the drain, where they can contaminate land and water resources, including drinking water,? said Commissioner Whitcomb. ?People holding these chemicals should contact the BPC as soon as possible to register for the October collection.? ?Providing Maine residents with an easy and no cost solution to properly dispose of pesticides gives Mainers the unique opportunity to make a positive impact on our environment and public health,? said Maine DEP Commissioner Patricia Aho. ?The collection events cover the State and are held in Presque Isle, Bangor, Augusta and Portland, providing accessible methods of collection and future disposal.? The collected chemicals go to out-of-state disposal facilities licensed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency where they are incinerated or reprocessed. Registration by September 25, 2015, is mandatory?drop-ins are not permitted. To register, get details, and learn important information about the temporary storage and transportation of obsolete pesticides, go to the BPC Web site at [http://www.thinkfirstspraylast.org](http://www.thinkfirstspraylast.org) or call 207-287-2731. The Maine Obsolete Pesticides Collection Program, jointly sponsored by the BPC and DEP, and paid for entirely through pesticide product registration fees, has kept more than 90 tons of pesticides out of the waste stream since its start in 1982. - For more information on the Maine Board of Pesticides Control, go to: [http://www.thinkfirstspraylast.org](http://www.thinkfirstspraylast.org) - For more information on the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, go to: [http://www.maine.gov/dep](http://www.maine.gov/dep) Important Note to the Media: Since registration is required, please post any information from this release as soon as possible.

Coastweek, September 19th to 26th, is Maine's largest volunteer effort to clean trash from our coastal lands and waters. This week hundreds of volunteers at many locations along the Maine coastline are participating in Coastweek, which is part of the 30th annual International Coastal Cleanup, the world's largest single day volunteer effort to clean up our beaches, lakes and rivers. International Coastal Cleanup Volunteers do more than just pick up trash: they document every bag, bowling ball and bottle cap, contributing to the only annual index of global marine debris. This citizen science has informed policy, and led to a new area of scientific research. Ocean trash compromises the health of humans and wildlife, and hurts local businesses that rely on a healthy ocean. Last year, more than 500,000 people globally picked up 16 million pounds of trash along 13,000 miles of coastline. In Maine, volunteers found 10,484 pounds of trash in 2014. Keeping our ocean free from trash is one of the easiest ways to make the ocean more resilient. From creating less trash to using proper trash disposal, everyone can help keep our ocean clean and free of debris.

Maine Coastal Program is working with you to protect the health of the Gulf of Maine. Together, we can work to maintain a healthy, productive and resilient ocean. # Governor LePage urges support for Hunters for the Hungry Program October 30, 2015 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 Deer season begins Saturday and donations provide meat to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households across the state AUGUSTA ? With the 2015 hunting season underway, Governor Paul R. LePage is again urging Maine hunters to consider supporting the Hunters for the Hungry Program by donating all or part of their harvest to feed families in need. The popular program provides a means for Maine hunters, as well as hunters from other states, to donate harvested game to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households with a medical need. ?The Hunters for the Hungry Program is a way that Maine hunters can pursue a sport they love and help their neighbors at the same time,? said Governor LePage. ?Donations can provide meat to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households across the state. The fact that this program has grown so steadily is both a testament to the need and the generosity of Mainers.? Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb noted that since its establishment in 1996, the Hunters for the Hungry Program has provided thousands of nutritious meals to people across the state. ?Since 1996, Maine sportsmen and women have contributed to a program that provides nutritious meals to people across Maine,? said Whitcomb. ?The Hunters for the Hungry Program puts high quality, native protein on the tables of Maine families.? The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry distributes many types of donations to food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and households with a medical need. The Hunters for the Hungry Program is part of the Department?s Emergency Food Assistance Program. It is done in cooperation with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife?s wardens, Maine State Troopers and hunters, are all working towards a common goal of helping fellow Mainers. The program accepts bear, deer and moose donations. Road kill donations are also accepted, provided the meat is not damaged. Hunters do not pay for the processing of donated meat. Meat processing costs are paid for by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry or the charity that receives the food. Hunters choosing to keep their game can still donate a few pounds to the program. Meat processors that are interested in getting involved with the program and learning how it works should call 207-287-7513.

If you are seeing moth flights this time of year, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Forest Service would like to know in order to better understand the locations and size of winter moth (Operophthera brumata) populations in Maine. Assistance from the public is being sought to help combat the destructive moth through use of a simple on-line survey to report winter moth sightings. ?The total economic impact of Maine?s forest industry is $8 billion with direct and indirect employment of 38,789 workers,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Fighting invasive insects like the winter moth is important to help protect that sector of our economy; in this case, hardwood trees and agricultural crops such as apples and blueberries. Public involvement will help professionals combat and minimize the destructive potential of this and other invasive species.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb stressed that filling out a simple online survey set by the Department to report winter moth sightings is very important. ?These reports are critical to building the bigger picture of this insect?s distribution,? said Whitcomb. ?A healthy forest is key to Maine?s forest economy. Citizen involvement in monitoring invasive pests is important to the future of rural Maine.? The survey can be accessed online at: [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/wintermothsurvey](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/wintermothsurvey) . Reports of moth flights can also be made by phone at (207) 287-2431. Why Look For Moths in December? December may seem like an odd time to set up traps for a defoliating forest pest. However, during the first week of December, DACF staff will set up traps along the coast and inland in southern Maine. Towns in the study region are cooperating by allowing traps to be hung on municipal property. Two homeowners in the most heavily infested areas have volunteered their services for a third year to make nightly counts of the moths trapped in their yards. Winter in Maine is quite suitable to getting winter moth observations from the public. The moth flies when it is dark?this time of year many people are still out after dark. Even if people are inside and glance out their windows, they may notice if there are small tan moths attracted to lights. Winter Moth History The winter moth was introduced into North America from Europe in the early part of the last century. It was first seen in Nova Scotia in the 1930s and then in the Pacific Northwest (British Columbia, Oregon and Washington) in the 1970s. Winter moth showed up in eastern Massachusetts in the early 2000s and has since spread westward in MA, into Rhode Island and now coastal Maine from Kittery to Bar Harbor. It was first reported in Maine in significant numbers in December 2011. The larvae (caterpillars) of winter moth defoliate deciduous trees and shrubs such as oaks, maples, apples and blueberries, in early spring. Heavy defoliation for several consecutive years leads to branch dieback and tree mortality. Winter moth defoliation has contributed to tens of thousands of acres of oak mortality in Massachusetts. Winter moth defoliation was first recorded in Maine in 2012. This year the annual Maine Forest Service aerial survey picked up moderate to heavy defoliation in the Cumberland County towns of Cape Elizabeth, Chebeague Island, Harpswell, Portland (Peaks Island) and Scarborough with over 10,000 acres mapped. On the ground, light to heavy defoliation could be seen in scattered locations from Kittery to Rockland. Adults are active from late November to January whenever the temperature is above freezing. Males are small, light brown to tan moths. They are attracted to lights and a chemical released by the females. Adult females are small, gray and look like a mosquito wearing a fur coat. They have reduced wings and are flightless. Females are most commonly found crawling on the trunks of trees. So if you see moths flying in December, let the Maine Forest Service know.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) today released its 2015 report on spruce budworm in Maine. Entomologists from the DACF?s Maine Forest Service note a steady rise in the numbers of insects caught in pheromone traps concentrated along the Canadian border. Quebec?s infestation now encompasses 15.6 million acres and has spread south onto the Gaspe Peninsula and toward Maine. The insect?s potential to become an outbreak over vast regions of commercially valuable spruce-fir forests has scientists and public official deeply concerned. An infestation can spread rapidly via moths migrating to new areas. ?The total economic impact of Maine?s forest industry is $8 billion with direct and indirect employment of 38,789 workers,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Fighting destructive pests like the spruce budworm is important to help protect Maine jobs and our economy. It is important that Maine?s forest professionals identified the potential threat early on, are on top of recent developments and are preparing action steps to help minimize the damage from a future budworm outbreak.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb stressed the DACF has been busy tracking the budworm by expanding the program used to determine its potential spread and impact. ?Permanent pheromone traps have been run annually for the past twenty years,? said Whitcomb. ?In light of the serious nature of the current potential threat to Maine forests, we significantly expanded our monitoring program last year. We are also working closely with stakeholders on a response plan to help minimize damage to our spruce-fir forests in the event of a major outbreak.? The report, Spruce Budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) in be [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/documents/2015sbwreport.pdf](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/documents/2015sbwreport.pdf) Maine?s Response: Because the last spruce budworm outbreak during the 1970s-80s grew quickly, killed millions of acres of spruce-fir stands, and cost the region?s economy many hundreds of millions of dollars, the Maine Spruce Budworm Task Force was formed in summer 2013 by the University of Maine?s Cooperative Forest Research Unit (CFRU), Maine Forest Service (MFS), and the Maine Forest Products Council (MFPC) to begin the process of preparing for the next outbreak of the eastern spruce budworm. Task teams including more than 65 experts on various aspects of the issue were assembled to address key aspects of the coming outbreak, including: wood supply & economic impacts; monitoring & protection; forest management; policy, regulatory and funding; wildlife habitat; public communications & outreach; and research priorities. Their pending report (which is in final drafting stages) includes an initial risk assessment of the coming spruce budworm outbreak and provides key recommendations for how Maine?s forestry community can begin preparing for and responding to the coming outbreak. Spruce Budworm: The native spruce budworm has long been recognized as a regular component of Maine's spruce-fir forests. Under normal (endemic) conditions populations of this insect are often so low as to be difficult to detect. Periodically, however, the budworm undergoes a population explosion (epidemic) and becomes so abundant that serious feeding damage occurs. Heavily infested stands appear reddish in July due to masses of dead, chewed needles clinging to the branches. Tree mortality may occur after several years of heavy feeding.

Governor Paul R. LePage and the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) are again urging holiday shoppers to purchase natural Christmas trees locally. Maine-grown Christmas trees are freshly cut, support local tree farms and most importantly, visiting a Maine ?Choose and Cut? Christmas tree operation can be a memorable family experience. The DACF?s Maine Forest Service offers tree purchasing, care and safety tips. ?The Christmas season is an important time to give thanks for the many blessings we are given and show appreciation for the contributions of others,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Nothing says Maine more than a locally grown fir tree that graces a family living room. The Maine people are truly fortunate to call this state home and to create products enjoyed beyond our borders.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb reflected on the unique experience that tree buyers can have harvesting their own tree from a Maine family tree farm. ?Maine tree growers grow a product that symbolizes the Maine outdoors and the Christmas holiday,? said Whitcomb. You can support local businesses by buying a Maine Christmas tree. You can also create a new family memory from the shared experience of harvesting a tree from a Maine family tree farm.? Maine Christmas Trees: Naturally grown Christmas trees are also much less harmful to the environment than artificial Christmas trees. Considered a ?renewable resource,? Maine Christmas trees provide fresh air, wildlife habitat and scenery while they are grown. After the holidays, most Christmas trees are returned to the forest where they can provide wildlife cover, reduce erosion and add nutrients to the soil. Here are some tips for purchasing fresh cut Maine Christmas trees: Always ask the seller ?where and when? the Christmas trees were cut. In general, the closer the location and the most recent shipment, the better. Don?t wait until the last minute to purchase your Maine Christmas tree. In the past few years, there have been shortages of Maine-grown Christmas trees. Check to make sure the Christmas tree is fresh. The needles of a freshly harvested balsam fir tree should bend about 30 ? 40 degrees before breaking. Some information on transporting and storing a Christmas tree: Make sure the Christmas tree is tied securely to your vehicle and that the butt end is facing forward. Avoid transporting the tree when the roads are wet. The spray from road can shorten the life of your tree and dull the color. If necessary, wrap the tree in a tarp. Once you transport the tree home, try to set it up inside soon. If you can?t, make sure you store it outside in a cool, dark location out of the sun and wind. A garage is a good place. Safety tips for setting up the tree at home: Before bringing the tree inside to display, cut off at least 2? of the butt end. This will help the tree stay moist and last longer. Make sure you have the correct tree stand for the size tree you have purchased. For most trees, the stand should hold at least a gallon of water. Keep the tree watered, especially the first few days after it is set up. There are inexpensive devices that can be purchased that help maintain a constant water level in the stand. Proper disposal of your Christmas tree: Completely remove all plastic and metal items from the tree. Do not burn the tree in your fireplace or woodstove. If all other recycling options are not practical, check with your local fire department, get a burn permit and burn it outdoors when there is snow on the ground. Recycle your tree at your local transfer station. If they don?t accept trees, consider leaving the tree in the woods (landowner permission is required) or near your birdfeeder to provide cover for songbirds. If possible, chip the tree and use the chips as mulch.

The same is true for household pets. To avoid spending stressful time with your veterinarian, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s State Veterinarian and Director of Animal Welfare are urging Mainers to consider some helpful pet safety tips. ?Healthy pets make happy owners. We want all Mainers and their pets to have a positive experience this holiday season,? said Maine State Veterinarian, Dr. Michele Walsh. ?A little bit of forethought can go a long way toward avoiding stressful, expensive, possibly fatal trips to a veterinarian. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and other organizations offer tips on how to help ensure that your pets make it through the holidays safely.? In addition to current pets, families often consider obtaining a new pet during the holiday season. Animal Welfare Director Liam Hughes recommends doing some basic research ahead of time, considering that pets require a long-term commitment. ?Pets owners need to be ready for a long-term emotional and financial commitment,? said Hughes. ?Before adopting or purchasing a new pet, people should consider a number of things, including: does my/our lifestyle allow time for a pet; what type of pet; and what are the costs associated with a pet? If you are looking for a pet in Maine, only look for animal shelters, pet stores, or breeders that are licensed by the state. Don?t buy animals on the side of the road, or in a parking lot and beware of online sales because you might not get what was advertised.? The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) website (https://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/holidays.aspx) offers the following Holiday Pet Safety tips: Food Keep people food away from pets. If you want to share holiday treats with your pets, make or buy treats formulated just for them. The following people foods are especially hazardous for pets: - Chocolate is an essential part of the holidays for many people, but it is toxic to dogs and cats. Although the toxicity can vary based on the type of chocolate, the size of your pet, and the amount they ate, it?s safer to consider all chocolate off limits for pets. - Other sweets and baked goods also should be kept out of reach. Not only are they often too rich for pets; an artificial sweetener often found in baked goods, candy and chewing gum, xylitol, has been linked to liver failure and death in dogs. - Turkey and turkey skin ? sometimes even in small amounts ? can cause a life-threatening condition in pets known as pancreatitis. - Table scraps ? including gravy and meat fat ?also should be kept away from pets. Many foods that are healthy for people are poisonous to pets, including onions, raisins and grapes. During the holidays, when our own diets tend toward extra-rich foods, table scraps can be especially fattening and hard for animals to digest and can cause pancreatitis. - Yeast dough can cause problems for pets, including painful gas and potentially dangerous bloating. Quick action can save lives. If you believe your pet has been poisoned or eaten something it shouldn?t have, call your veterinarian or local veterinary emergency clinic immediately. You may also want to call the ASPCA Poison Control Hotline: 1-888-426-4435. Signs of pet distress include: sudden changes in behavior, depression, pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. Decorating Greenery, lights and Christmas trees can make the holidays festive, but they also pose risky temptations for our pets. -Christmas trees can tip over if pets climb on them or try to play with the lights and ornaments. Consider tying your tree to the ceiling or a doorframe using fishing line to secure it. - Ornaments can cause hazards for pets. Broken ornaments can cause injuries, and ingested ornaments can cause intestinal blockage or even toxicity. Keep any homemade ornaments, particularly those made from salt-dough or other food-based materials, out of reach of pets. -Tinsel and other holiday decorations also can be tempting for pets to eat. Consuming them can cause intestinal blockages, sometimes requiring surgery. Breakable ornaments or decorations can cause injuries. -Flowers and festive plants can result in an emergency veterinary visit if your pet gets hold of them. Amaryllis, mistletoe, balsam, pine, cedar, and holly are among the common holiday plants that can be dangerous and even poisonous to pets who decide to eat them. Poinsettias can be troublesome as well. The ASPCA offers lists of plants that are toxic to dogs and cats. -Candles are attractive to pets as well as people. Never leave a pet alone in an area with a lit candle; it could result in a fire. -Potpourris should be kept out of reach of inquisitive pets. Liquid potpourris pose risks because they contain essential oils and cationic detergents that can severely damage your pet?s mouth, eyes and skin. Solid potpourris could cause problems if eaten. Hosting Parties and Visitors Visitors can upset pets, as can the noise and excitement of holiday parties. Even pets that aren?t normally shy may become nervous in the hubbub that can accompany a holiday gathering. The following tips will reduce emotional stress on your pet and protect your guests from possible injury. -All pets should have access to a comfortable, quiet place inside if they want to retreat. Make sure your pet has a room or crate somewhere away from the commotion, where your guests won?t follow, that it can go to anytime it wants to get away. Inform your guests ahead of time that you have pets or if other guests may be bringing pets to your house. Guests with allergies or compromised immune systems (due to pregnancy, disease, or medications/ treatments that suppress the immune system) need to be aware of the pets (especially exotic pets) in your home so they can take any needed precautions to protect themselves. Guests with pets? If guests ask to bring their own pets and you don?t know how the pets will get along, you should either politely decline their request or plan to spend some time acclimating the pets to each other, supervising their interactions, monitoring for signs of a problem, and taking action to avoid injuries to pets or people. Pets that are nervous around visitors should be put it in another room or a crate with a favorite toy. If your pet is particularly upset by houseguests, talk to your veterinarian about possible solutions to this common problem. Exotic pets make some people uncomfortable and may themselves be more easily stressed by gatherings. Keep exotic pets safely away from the hubbub of the holidays. Watch the exits. Even if your pets are comfortable around guests, make sure you watch them closely, especially when people are entering or leaving your home. While you?re welcoming hungry guests and collecting coats, a four-legged family member may make a break for it out the door and become lost. Identification tags and microchips reunite families. Make sure your pet has proper identification with your current contact information ? particularly a microchip with up-to-date, registered information. That way, if they do sneak out, they?re more likely to be returned to you. If your pet isn?t already microchipped, talk to your veterinarian about the benefits of this simple procedure. Clear the food from your table, counters and serving areas when you are done using them ? and make sure the trash gets put where your pet can?t reach it. A turkey or chicken carcass or other large quantities of meat sitting out on the carving table, or left in a trash container that is easily opened, could be deadly to your family pet. Dispose of carcasses and bones ? and anything used to wrap or tie the meat, such as strings, bags and packaging ? in a covered, tightly secured trash bag placed in a closed trash container outdoors (or behind a closed, locked door). Trash also should be cleared away where pets can?t reach it ? especially sparkly ribbon and other packaging or decorative items that could be tempting for your pet to play with or consume. When You Leave the House - Unplug decorations while you're not around. Cats, dogs and other pets are often tempted to chew electrical cords. - Take out the trash to make sure your pets can?t get to it, especially if it contains any food or food scraps.

LePage is urging fisherman and outdoor enthusiasts to exercise caution amidst reports of hazardous ice conditions in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway (AWW) and throughout Maine heading into the holiday weekend and the opening of ice fishing season. Unseasonably warm weather has delayed the formation of good, solid ice in many parts of the state, including some of Maine?s northern most destinations. AWW Rangers from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry are reporting hazardous ice conditions on the Allagash headwater lakes. Governor Paul R. LePage is urging ice fisherman, snowmobilers and outdoor enthusiasts to use extreme caution when heading outdoors this weekend. ?This week many Maine residents and visitors will be out snowmobiling and ice fishing to open the 2016 season,? said Governor LePage. ?Anglers should enjoy the ice fishing season that begins Friday, January 1, but exercise caution regarding ice conditions in light of the unseasonably warm weather Maine experienced over the Christmas holiday. Please take precautions so that your outdoor experiences are safe and memorable.? Conditions in the Allagash Wilderness Waterway AWW Superintendent Matthew LaRoche warned that Chamberlain Lake skimmed over for the first time on Monday night, 12/28/15. Over a foot of snow was received on Tuesday. That snow will help insulate the ice and slow down the formation good solid ice. The smaller bodies of water and coves were frozen over when rangers were out checking ice conditions on Monday. Churchill Lake was 90% closed in on Monday, but there was open water all around the edges of the lake. There is also open water in all thoroughfares that connect the lakes. Rangers and wardens will be out checking the ice on Thursday and Friday. People can stop in at the Chamberlain Bridge Ranger Station for up to date information on ice conditions or call the waterway dispatch service in Ashland at (207) 435-7963. If you have reservations at one of the area sporting camps, you should check with the camp operators before heading up for the weekend. LaRoche is urging people to stay off the ice with snowmobiles. If you do venture out on the ice, do so on foot, and stay in the coves, you should check the ice as you go out. ?An inch of ice isn?t very much, and that thickness may vary from location to location,? LaRoche said. ?The ice is just not safe enough to cross any of the waterway headwater lakes yet.? He urged those heading out to fish this weekend to tell someone where you are going and take someone with you. The AWW superintendent warned all visitors to stay away from thoroughfares avoid tributary streams when traveling on the ice. ?We usually have a good crowd out ice fishing on the first weekend of the season,? LaRoche said, referring to the upcoming ice fishing season which starts Friday, Jan. 1. ?The native brook trout fishing is usually excellent when the season first opens.? The AWW provides: winter campgrounds at the Chamberlain Bridge and Kellogg Brook; public drinking water, vault toilets, and snow plowing. A groomed snowmobile trail is marked from the Chamberlain Bridge parking lot to the south end of Chamberlain Lake and to Round Pond/Telos lakes. The AWW is a 92-mile-long ribbon of lakes, ponds, streams and river that wind through the heart of northern Maine?s vast commercial forest. The waterway became the first state-administered river to be designated by the United States Department of Interior as a component of the federal Wild and Scenic River Program. This designation was the culmination of an effort began in the early 1960s, to protect the outstanding natural character, unique recreational opportunities, and historical significance of the Allagash River and its associated lakes and ponds.

Brian Klippenstein, Executive Director of Protect the Harvest, spoke to a sold out audience at the Maine Agricultural Trades Show Commissioner?s Luncheon. A guest of Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb, Klipperstein told attendees that the predicted doubling of world food demand presents opportunity for U.S. agriculture if we embrace diversity in agriculture, honor science and technology and work together. Key Points from Klippenstein?s Remarks: The predicted doubling of world food demand creates extraordinary opportunity for US Producers. The US has soil, climate, tradition, land grant universities and technologies provider partners and the best farmers capable of helping meet skyrocketing demand. We will need to produce as much food in next 40 years as the previous 7,000 (According to World Wildlife Fund). It remains a hungry and troubled world and nearly a billion people are already chronically malnourished and two billion live on less than $3 per day. Technology is not the enemy; hunger and poverty are the enemies. We must protect the viability of science and technology. There are now heaps of money in the agitator community trying to control your plate. Food imperialists oppose consumer choice and, in particular, affordable food options. The country is more urban and agriculture must stick together. It is not just possible but mandatory that we foster diverse agriculture. There is no one way. How could there be 7 billion individuals with difference tastes, priorities, and incomes and different soil and climate and skills? There is no one way. The world needs all of the above to maximize diverse and affordable options. If we honor science and technology and refuse the activists plan to divide us, we can provide more consumer choice and affordable options, minimize hunger and human suffering, and return economic growth to all rural regions of our country. Brian Klippenstein: Brian Klippenstein, Executive Director of Protect the Harvest, leads a nationwide advocacy for safe and affordable food choices sufficient to meet the unprecedented demands for food around the world in the upcoming half-century. Raised in Northwest Missouri on a large registered beef cattle farm, he has experience across North and South America working both on ranches and showing cattle. A graduate of George Washington University with a degree in Business, Economic and Public Policy, Brian worked 26 years in D.C. on Capitol Hill for a Congressman and two State of Missouri U.S. Senators, the last five years as Chief of Staff. Propelled by his high protein red meat diet, Brian pursues athletic endeavors that range from being Captain of the G.W.

Commissioner Walt Whitcomb announced eight (8) Agricultural Development Grant Program awards totaling nearly $250,000 at the Maine Agricultural Trades Show today. The projects address needs in the agricultural industry for development of livestock processing; improved utilization and profitability of Maine grown crops; product enhancements for nutrition and/or food safety; and alternative markets or diversification including merchandising, farm stands, rural tours and educational opportunities. ?Maine has the most farms and the greatest diversity of food production in New England,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?The potential to produce and sell Maine products is even greater when you consider Maine?s reputation for quality and the growing interest in locally grown foods. The investments being announced today strengthen Maine agriculture and will help farmers and producers realize their full economic potential.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb highlighted the efforts of the review committee and its careful selection of projects from dozens of competitive applications. ?Selected proposals incorporated one or more of four priorities: development of livestock processing; improved utilization and profitability of Maine grown crops; product enhancements for nutrition and/or food safety; and alternative markets or diversification including merchandising, farm stands, rural tours and educational opportunities,? said Whitcomb. ?We congratulate the grantees and look forward to successful implementation of their projects.? The preliminary selections were chosen by a review committee from 30 qualified proposals submitted in response to a formal Request For Proposals (RFP). Out of the total thirty (30) qualified proposals received and reviewed by a committee in a competitive review process, eight (8) projects have been tentatively identified pending approval by the State of Maine Purchases Division and the successful completion of a State of Maine contract. These projects have been identified as: Coastal Enterprises, Inc.

Nearly 90 percent of Maine?s family woodland owners are happy with the results of recent timber harvesting on their land. That?s the key finding of a survey conducted by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Forest Service. The survey was drawn from a random sample of family woodland owners who own less than 1,000-acre ownerships statewide and who had recently completed a harvest on at least a portion of their woods. ?Healthy forests are vital to our economy and way of life,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Effective strategies for active forest management improve forest health, wood availability, wildlife habitat, water quality, recreational opportunities and our overall quality of life.? ?Farmers and other small woodlot owners, particularly in southern Maine, can enhance their surroundings by selectively harvesting trees,? said DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?We?re very pleased with the results of this survey,? said Maine Forest Service Director Doug Denico. ?We found that Maine?s family woodland owners are quite satisfied with the outcomes of timber harvesting on their land ? including aesthetics, wildlife habitat, recreation and income.? ?Timber harvests in Maine are being conducted by a highly professional logging work force, often in consultation with licensed foresters, and the outcomes are largely positive for the customer, the landowner,? said Pat Sirois, Director of the Maine Sustainable Forestry Initiative. ?The good news for landowners is that this survey indicates a good job occurs on nine out of every ten harvests.? Survey Results: Over 63% of woodland owners were ?very satisfied? and over 27% were ?somewhat satisfied? with the overall outcome of their harvest. Nearly 59% were ?very satisfied? and over 29% were ?somewhat satisfied? with the overall condition of their woods after the harvest. 56% were ?very satisfied? and nearly 30% were ?somewhat satisfied? with the financial outcomes of their harvests. 78% felt the logger understood their objectives and respected the owner?s vision for their woodlands ?very well,? and 84% said they would work with the same logger again. 77% of woodland owners said they would harvest again, when conditions were right. Maine?s Healthy Forests Program: The survey was conducted in support of Maine?s Healthy Forests Program. The Healthy Forests Program?s goals are to: (1) identify strategies that lead to active forest management on Maine family woodlands, particularly in the southern part of the state; (2) improve wood availability, wildlife habitat, forest health, recreational opportunities, water quality, aesthetics, etc.; and (3) increase landowner enjoyment and support jobs and the state's economy. The program is a partnership that includes the Maine Forest Service, Maine?s Sustainable Forestry Initiative, the Certified Logging Professional Program, and others with an interest in a healthy forest.

Officials from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Maine Maple Producers Association report that maple tapping is underway throughout the state, with southern and central regions further along. This year?s unseasonably warm, fluctuating temperatures have allowed producers to tap earlier and generated high hopes for a longer, more productive 2016 maple season. \"Many Maine maple producers, particularly in the southern and central regions, had some very productive days last weekend.? said Lyle Merrifield, President of the Maine Maple Producers Association. ?This season is earlier than most, raising hopes that it will run longer and produce greater yields of sap and maple syrup. Obviously, we will produce what weather conditions allow.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb highlighted support from Governor Paul R. LePage and DACF efforts to work with the maple industry and the Maine Maple Producers Association to strengthen and expand the maple economy. ?Governor LePage has expressed his desire to see Maine become #1 for maple production,? said Whitcomb. ?That is a very high bar, but the industry and department is working very hard to create more maple products and grow the industry. Governor LePage will mark the unofficial start to the 2016 season by ceremonially tapping a maple tree on the Blaine House lawn next month.

LePage, Budworm Task Force to release risk assessment and response plan March 9, 2016 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 AUGUSTA - Gov. Paul R. LePage and members of the Maine Spruce Budworm Task Force will unveil ?Coming Spruce Budworm Outbreak: Initial Risk Assessment and Preparation & Response Recommendations for Maine?s Forestry Community? at a news conference in the Cabinet Room on Wednesday, March 16 at 9 a.m. ?Maine assembled an impressive team of experts in advance of this spruce budworm outbreak to learn from the last outbreak and take steps to help minimize damage from this one,? said Gov. LePage. ?I commend members of the Maine Spruce Budworm Task Force for their time, expertise and recommendations on how to address the infestation. The last SBW infestation cost Maine?s forest-based economy hundreds of millions of dollars and had a devastating effect on the forest products industry in Maine.? The eastern spruce budworm is believed to be the most damaging forest insect in Maine and North America. Outbreaks of the insect that kills balsam fir and spruce trees occur every 30 to 60 years. Severe defoliation already has occurred in an area the size of Maine in southern Quebec. An update will be provided at the press conference on the infestation?s progress toward Maine. During the last outbreak, which lasted from 1970?85, the insect decimated up to 25 million cords of spruce/fir wood, 21 percent of all fir trees in the state, according to the Maine Forest Products Council. The infestation cost the state?s forest-based economy hundreds of millions of dollars and had lasting effects on forest management. The Maine Spruce Budworm Task Force formed in 2013 to determine the economic and ecological effects another outbreak might have on the state and a strategy to minimize those effects. Leading the task force were Wagner, Patrick Strauch, executive director of the Maine Forest Products Council; and Doug Denico, director of the Maine Forest Service. Task force teams included about 65 experts who focused on wood supply and economic impacts; monitoring and protection; forest management; policy, regulatory and funding; wildlife habitat; communications and outreach; and research priorities. A draft of the report was released for public review in November 2014. Task force team leaders presented the report to municipalities, environmental groups, the legislature, logging contractors and economic development consortiums. The report includes about 70 recommendations, several of which have already been implemented. The report?s recommendations on preparing for the outbreak include increasing monitoring efforts, applying insecticides where needed, changing forest management strategies such as harvesting, and seeking markets for presalvage trees that likely would be lost. Printed copies of the report, as well as an executive summary and a brochure will be available at the press conference and, at its conclusion, online. Contacts: - Dr. Robert Wagner, Henry W.

March 21, 2016 For more information contact: Samantha Howard at: 207-287-7620 Commissioner Whitcomb formally announces adoption of international grading system for maple syrup to promote the industry AUGUSTA ? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb today formally announced that Maine has adopted the international grading system for maple syrup. His notification, required for adoption of this international standard to take effect, comes in advance of this year?s Maine Maple Sunday, held Sunday, March 27, 2016. Most Maine producers have already implemented the voluntary standards in hopes of providing consumers with a better understanding of the natural product they are buying. Maple Sunday is held annually, every fourth Sunday of the month. Participating sugarhouses will be open for visitors to enjoy freshly made maple syrup and candy, demonstrations of syrup production, sugarbush tours and a variety of other family activities. Governor Paul R. LePage recently highlighted maple tapping season with Maine Maple producers on the Blaine House lawn by following an annual tradition: the tapping of a maple tree. The Governor recognized the economic contributions of Maine?s maple syrup industry and potential for continued growth. ?Maine?s maple industry contributes an estimated $48.7 million to the Maine economy,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?That includes a direct contribution of $27.7 million and multiplier effects. The Maine maple industry is working hard to realize its potential for creating more jobs, business opportunities and locally-produced products valued by consumers.? The voluntary standards announced by Commissioner Whitcomb are designed to match those used by other countries in order to give consumers standardized information for selecting maple syrup. It is in response to a 2010 petition from the International Maple Syrup Institute, an organization of producers in the United States and Canada. ?The new system, utilized by most Maine producers, combines 4-5 different systems into one standard that is easier for consumers to follow,? said Whitcomb. ?Customers benefit from a system that more accurately portrays what they are buying and how it tastes. Retailers can also more easily choose the grades they want to stock based on customer preferences.? Maine Maple Statistics: - 545,000 gallons were produced last year, worth $17.4 million - Maine?s industry has an annual statewide economic contribution, including multiplier effects, of an estimated $48.7 million in output, 805 full-and part-time jobs, and $25.1 million in labor income - Maine has the third largest syrup industry in this country. Maine has the largest maple producing county in the country ? Somerset County - Maine has around 1.4 million taps Some sugarhouses will hold events on both Saturday and Sunday.

USDA?s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) today reported that Maine honey production increased 25 percent in 2015. Maine state officials welcomed the news, while adding that the number of licensed beekeepers has almost tripled in the last decade and registered hive counts have jumped from 5,000 to more than 10,000. Despite a harsh winter in 2015, favorable weather conditions resulted in the increase in honey production. ?The number of licensed beekeepers in Maine has almost tripled in the last decade and registered hive counts have jumped from 5,000 to nearly 10,000,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?That, coupled with the news that honey production was up 25 percent last year, is yet another sign that Maine agriculture continues to make progress toward the goal of becoming the breadbasket of New England.? ?Maine Maple Sunday is this weekend, but with the transition to a new season, it is also important to note that Maine produces another all natural sweetener, honey,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Maine has taken a number of steps to promote growth in natural resource products and support small entrepreneurs, including beekeepers. Regarding production of honey, we are also pursuing strategies to protect pollinators, who are also vitally important to fruit and vegetable production. Last year, the DACF unveiled a Pollinator Protection Plan designed to reduce risks to pollinators in the state.? According to the records of State Apiarist Tony Jadczak, 975 resident beekeepers registered 9,789 hives in 2015 and 76,058 hives entered the state for crop pollination down from 83,00 in 2014. The increase in hobby beekeepers have contributed to the number of licensed beekeepers and the increase in honey production. Maine Honey Statistics reported by NASS: Honey production in 2015 from Maine producers with five or more colonies totaled 470 thousand pounds, up 25 percent from 2014, according to Gary Keough, State Statistician of the USDA?s National Agricultural Statistics Service, New England Field Office. There were 10 thousand colonies producing honey in 2015, up 25 percent from 2014. Yield per colony averaged 47 pounds, unchanged from 2014. Honey prices increased during 2015 to 551 cents per pound, up 10 percent from 499 cents per pound in 2014. Producer honey stocks were 47 thousand pounds on December 15, 2015, up 15 percent from a year earlier. NASS provides accurate, timely, and useful statistics in service to U.S. agriculture.

The Land Use Planning Commission (LUPC) recently adopted zoning rules that provide opportunity for rural business to locate and grow in new areas of Aroostook County. The rule changes establish a rural business development zone that can be used by businesses and property owners to accommodate business development in 30 towns, townships and plantations across Aroostook County that are part of the unorganized and deorganized areas of the state. The changes are a product of the LUPC?s Community Guided Planning and Zoning (CGPZ) initiative, which joins with local partners to help regions identify their land use needs and plan for the region?s future. ?This is an example of how state government can assist local communities in strengthening rural economies by removing regulatory hurdles that impede economic development,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?The LUPC?s work with local partners in Aroostook County demonstrates that a pro-job planning approach can be taken without adversely impacting Maine?s environment.? ?The Governor has been very clear since day one that he wants to create more jobs and economic opportunities in rural Maine,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?I commend the hard work of our Aroostook County partners and the Land Use Planning Commission. Their work promotes a more user-friendly model for activities that impact unorganized and deorganized areas in Maine.? In Aroostook County, the Northern Maine Development Commission (NMDC) and a citizen steering committee worked with the LUPC to develop new zoning opportunities and improve the business climate in the county. ?We recognize that home-based and other rural businesses are an important part of the economy in Aroostook County,? said Nick Livesay, Director of the LUPC. ?The dedicated residents and other stakeholders who served on the steering committee, with support from NMDC and the Commission, have developed regulatory changes that give new opportunity for business growth in rural northern Maine.? The rule changes developed in Aroostook County are the first to come out of the LUPC?s CGPZ initiative and become effective on May 9. Efforts to improve the effectiveness of land use planning and provide for economic development opportunities in the unorganized and deorganized areas of Maine have focused, in part, on the need for more locally guided and proactive planning for these areas. This is a result of 2012 legislation that called for more prospective zoning and emphasized the LUPC?s role in honoring the rights and participation of residents and property owners in the areas of the state that it serves. The LUPC will continue to collaborate with partners in Aroostook County to plan for future land use needs, and is working with local and regional partners on similar CGPZ projects in other regions including, in Franklin, Somerset, and Washington counties.

May 19, 2016 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 Maine receives National Award for Campground Reservations Service AUGUSTA ? The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Campground Reservations service (www.campwithme.com) was named an IT Program of the Year by StateScoop, a national publication that features leaders and innovators in government technology. The national award comes at a time when reservations and visitations at Maine State Parks are up compared to last year?s record-setting totals. In 2015, 2,626,416 people visited Maine State Parks, the highest attendance since 1985. Through April 2016, total attendance (day use and camping) is up 45% compared to last year. ?Maine is open for business and our campground reservations service is an example of how state government is becoming more efficient, effective and responsive to taxpayers and summer visitors,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Continuous improvement throughout state government is our shared goal. Hard working Maine taxpayers deserve nothing less.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb highlighted how the improvements directly benefit consumers. ?We want visitors to our state parks to have an enjoyable experience, starting with ease in making reservations,? said Whitcomb. ?Campers often have their hearts set on a certain site and on particular dates. It is important that our online service allows them to book what they want reliably, efficiently and securely. Awards and positive recognition from both inside and outside state government, reinforces our belief that we are meeting this goal.? StateScoop 50 awards: Approximately 80,000 votes were cast for the StateScoop 50 awards, narrowing down hundreds of nominations to just 50 winners in the categories of IT Program of the Year, Innovation of the Year, Industry Leadership, Up and Comer, State Leadership, and State Executives of the Year. Maine?s Campground Reservations service: Is a web-based reservation system allowing users to reserve nights at any of Maine?s twelve state parks. Prior to this solution, users were provided an online form to request a campsite. When the season began, nearly 3,000 people would be vying for similar sites and dates, all of which had to be manually processed by the call center staff, a process that took almost a month to complete. Reservations are now processed online by users for Sebago State Park on the first opening day and for all other parks on the second opening day which occurs one week later. The web-based system reliably handles the opening day rush, processing hundreds of transactions in the first fifteen minutes of each opening day. What used to take weeks to process now takes roughly a half hour. The Campground Reservations service was developed through a collaboration with Maine?s eGovernment partner, Maine Information Network, LLC, a subsidiary of NIC, at no cost to taxpayers. About Maine.gov Maine.gov (http://www.Maine.gov) is the official Web portal of the State of Maine.

Beginning next week, the MCMI survey vessel Amy Gale will use state-of-the art sonar technology in an attempt find the cables which got tangled with dredging equipment when the Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) last dredged this section of the Saco River in the 1990?s. The ACOE has advised the cities that they must clear the area to be dredged of the cable and any other in-river obstructions before the ACOE will dredge there again. ?The Saco River is economically important to Biddeford, Saco and the region,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?According to a joint letter submitted by those communities to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Saco River contributes more than $53 Million annually in economic impact to Saco and Biddeford and is home to more than 40 commercial fishing vessels. The State of Maine is providing sonar capabilities in support of their effort to maintain the navigability of the river and help boost their coastal economies.? In-River Survey Work to begin Next Week: The MCMI survey vessel, Amy Gale, is tentatively scheduled to be in the Saco River the week of May 23rd and will be docked at Rumery?s Boat Yard and will be available for tours by appointment. The in-river survey work is expected to take about three days. The MCMI deploys a Kongsberg EM2040C Multibeam Echosounder, drop camera, and grab sampler in addition to a wide array of water quality parameter equipment. The survey platform is a 35-foot lobster vessel outfitted for extended survey work. MCMI: Formed in 2012, the MCMI is a collaboration of state, federal, academic and non-profit agencies and organizations that provides seafloor imagery, modeling, and oceanographic data collection capacity to support ocean resources management and scientific investigations in Maine. Part of the DACF, the MCMI is led by the Maine Coastal Program. The DACF?s Submerged Lands Program (SLP) is providing funding for this project. The SLP administers a leasing program which provides limited use leases and easements that allow piers and other structures to be built on, and over, state-owned, public submerged lands. SLP lease fees are used to support municipal harbor management activities and public access improvements in Maine?s coastal waters and Great Ponds.

A dedication event celebrating veterans and their sacrifices to our nation and state will be held on Friday, May 27, at 10 a.m., concluding more than five years of planning, interagency coordination, engineering studies, budget development, fundraising and construction. ?Maine appreciates and welcomes the contributions of veterans,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?We invite the men and women who served our country to consider living, working and retiring here. Changes have been made to our tax code, benefits and veteran?s services to attract those who have served in our military to Maine. This modest, but important improvement to Sebago Lake State Park is yet another sign that the many contributions and sacrifices of veterans are remembered and appreciated here.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb will speak at the dedication and will acknowledge the many organizations who have worked to acknowledge the contributions of veterans and create the fishing platforms. ?These fishing platforms have been built to honor our heroes, to remember their achievements and to say thank you for their sacrifices,? said Whitcomb. ?Organizations such as Wounded Warriors and Project Healing Waters have proved the therapeutic qualities of fishing. We hope that the Veteran?s Fishing Pier is able to play a beneficial role with the physical and emotional rehabilitation of our disabled military veterans.? During the winter of 2010 ? 2011, a small group from the Mollyockett and Sebago Chapters of Trout Unlimited (TU) began to discuss and plan for the construction of a fishing platform to honor and facilitate the needs of disabled veterans. The brainchild of Mollyockett Chapter founding member and past Chapter President George Westerberg, the idea took shape slowly over the next few months and years. The project began as George's desire to welcome home veterans bearing the disabling wounds of war. His vision was to provide a facility which would allow disabled veterans, accustomed to fishing for wild trout and salmon before their service connected disabilities and now finding it difficult to access the wild places they were accustomed to fishing, an opportunity to once again enjoy the peace and healing qualities of fishing and would offer an opportunity to contribute to the rehabilitation of our wounded warriors. Of the project, Lee Margolin, past President and founder of the Mollyockett Chapter, said: ?The Veteran?s Fishing Platforms will extend the usual physical therapy programs already employed in the treatment of disabled veterans, while including easy access to the beloved outdoor recreation and the personal satisfaction that can only be found in open spaces and quiet surroundings. We believe the effect of providing this recreation opportunity for disabled vets will also lower the cost of medical care and enable and hopefully speed the recovery of these individuals who have sacrificed so much for our freedom.? Once the group had formed their ideas into an actionable plan they began meeting with the various state agencies which would be responsible for the different aspects of the project. The Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife and the Bureau of Parks and Land identified the Songo Lock location as the perfect spot to provide access to one of Maine?s ?blue ribbon? landlocked salmon waters and championed approval of the location. The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and its Bureau of Parks and Land then stepped forward and coordinated the heavy lifting of feasibility studies, engineering planning and design, budget development, permitting, application for the Land and Water Conservation Fund grant which provided nearly half the required funds, and finally construction. Throughout the process the Mollyockett Chapter of TU worked tirelessly to raise the funds required to pay for half the cost of the project. Grants were awarded from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, Trout Unlimited and the Davis Conservation Fund. Additionally, the project received generous donations from: LL Bean, Poland Spring, the Mollyockett Chapter of TU, the Sebago Chapter of TU, the Upper Andro Anglers Alliance, Eldredge Brothers Lumber and Hardware, Schiavi Custom Builders, Jim and Cindy Mullen, Terradyne Consultants, Fly Fishing in Maine, American Legion Posts 17, 19, and 83, Veterans of Foreign Wars Posts 6783, 6859 and 11362, Dr. William and Mrs. Marjorie Medd and numerous individual contributors. All told, the Mollyockett Chapter raised the nearly $140,000 required. Finally, after nearly five years since its inception, construction of the one-of-a-kind facility in the Northeast began in early September 2015. Trout Unlimited is dedicated to conserving, protecting and restoring cold water fisheries and in 2011, started it's Veteran's Service Program as a means of mobilizing TU's grassroots members in helping courageous men and women heal from the wounds of war. In kicking off the project, TU's president and CEO Chris Wood stated: ?The success of Trout Unlimited is built on a legacy of service; service of people who donate their time and resources to protect sensitive habitats, repair degraded rivers, and teach children about conservation through fishing. Tonight we celebrate a different kind of service ? the service of the men and women who have selflessly defended our liberty. We are blessed with an exceptional band of people who have made extraordinary sacrifices to protect the rights and freedoms that make the United States great. Our reward is the opportunity to express our most sincere thanks to them. Saint Ambrose once said, ?No duty is more urgent than that of returning thanks.? As we gather tonight to thank our veterans, all of us at Trout Unlimited thank you for your involvement and support.? The kiosk at the Veterans Fishing Platforms states in part: ?Convenient access to this fishery is made possible through the gift of Trout Unlimited, and its friends, to all disabled veterans who come here to fish and find healing in these storied waters. For the angler, the ritual of the salmon's life and survival has long been one of fascination and wonder. To hook and catch him is one of the reasons people come here to fish. The disabled veteran has still another reason.? The landlocked salmon coming out of Sebago Lake to spawn in the fall and chasing smelts in the spring are as wild as their genetic ancestors of 10,000 years ago. With the construction of these fishing platforms and their easy accessibility, no disabled veteran will now have to abandon the anticipation he or she once felt when the snow begins to melt in March. Statement Regarding Egg Turner Facility June 8, 2016 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) sent a letter and video to the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) requesting an investigation of the ?Shell Egg Production Facility in Turner.? In response to this complaint, the Department is conducting an investigation into the assertions made regarding that facility. In the interim, the DACF is issuing the following statement regarding food safety as it relates to eggs from the Turner facility. The DACF has assessed whether there is any immediate threat to human health from the eggs produced at the Turner facility. We have no evidence that would suggest or indicate the eggs coming from those facilities are unsafe for human consumption. As always consumers are advised to continue normal handling and cooking practices. Food safety surveillance reports conducted at the state level (part of Maine?s SE Risk Reduction Program for Commercial Poultry Operations with over 10,000 birds) for the Hillandale facilities suggest that the eggs from the facility are safe for human consumption. This is ongoing surveillance, with years of data to support this claim. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has jurisdiction over egg-producing facilities of this size, and they employ their own inspectors, as does USDA. Egg safety at the facility is FDA jurisdiction, under the Egg Safety Rule. Maine?s Salmonella enteritidis (SE) monitoring program, which helps producers meet the requirements of the FDA?s Egg Safety Rule, applies to facilities with 10,000 or more laying hens producing eggs for human consumption. We have had no reports of food safety violations at the facility now or in the recent past. State inspectors are routinely present at the site constantly monitoring and testing for any increased levels of disease pathogens. To date, our records are complete and do not show abnormal levels. Maine Fair Season is underway! June 28, 2016 For more information contact: Melissa Jordan at: 207-592-2126 A new series of farm-to-fair videos highlight Maine fairs AUGUSTA ? Maine Agricultural Fair Season is officially underway, beginning last week with the Maple Meadow Fair Festival in Mapleton and extending into October when Maine holds its largest Fair, the Fryeburg Fair. Maine has twenty-six licensed fairs that take place over the summer and fall, offering visitors opportunities to learn more about agriculture and the communities they take place in. This year, fairs will be celebrated in a new series of farm-to-fair videos featuring behind the scenes stories of fair participants. They are part of a collaborative effort between the Department and several fair exhibitors to highlight the work and care that goes into traditional activities offered at Maine fairs. ?Through the summer and into fall, Maine?s agricultural fairs showcase our state?s agricultural interests and the communities they are located in,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Maine fairs highlight the continued growth of Maine agriculture and its contributions to our natural resource economy.? Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb highlighted the new series of farm-to-fair videos. ?For over 175 years, Maine agricultural fairs have been a part of who we are as a state,? said Whitcomb. ?They help connect the public to timeless traditions of rural Maine life. The farm-to-fair videos showcase six important elements of the Maine fair experience: 4-H Show Cattle, Ox Pulling, Horse Pulling, Harness Racing and Barrel Racing. Participants and those who contributed to the creation of this series, have done a great job of capturing the essence of what helps make agricultural fairs unique.?

The Maine Center for Disease Control and the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry would like to remind everyone to use good judgment while attending Maine?s fairs. - If you are ill, do not attend the fair. This is not only in the best interest of those around you, but also the animals. Animals are susceptible to human illnesses including influenza. - Handwashing is crucial for limiting the spread of disease. Remember to wash hands before and after touching animals to reduce the risk of spreading illness from you to the animal and from the animal to you. - Before eating, wash your hands with soap and water?alcohol hand gel or sanitizer should be used only if soap and water are not available. This will help reduce the risk of gastrointestinal illness, such as Salmonella. ?Maine agricultural fairs and events aim to showcase the best of Maine?s agriculture, past and present, and hope to inspire new generations to continue this legacy. We urge the public to observe the guidance provided at the fairs and in articles like this one to keep everyone safe. Regular handwashing is a key way to keep everyone healthy,? said State Veterinarian Michele Walsh. ?The public plays a crucial role in keeping everyone?humans and animals healthy.? The Maine CDC and DACF are working closely with the Maine Association of Agricultural Fairs to promote smart, healthy decisions. This includes providing posters to fairs highlighting safety concerns, on-site visits by DACF veterinary staff to monitor animal health, and fair evaluation reports which include an assessment of Animal and Human Public Health activities. ?This is a wonderful time of year and Maine families should be able to get out and enjoy this tradition. We hope our partnership with the Department of Agriculture and all 26 state fairs will make sure all attendees will have a safe, educational and fun experience,? said Maine?s State Epidemiologist, Dr. Siiri Bennett.

Turfgrass Workshop Held to Improve Safety at Sports Fields August 1, 2016 For more information contact: Kathy Murray at: 207-287-7616 OAKLAND - Keeping school sports fields safe for student athletes was the theme of a recent all-day workshop hosted by Regional School District 18 on July 26th at Messalonskee Middle School in Oakland. The School and Sports-field Turfgrass Workshop, organized by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, showcased a particular turf care practice called overseeding. The practice is used to improve field safety by preventing weeds and filling bare spots. Nearly 100 school grounds keepers and turf care professionals from around the state convened to learn the latest science-based recommendations for sports field maintenance. RSU 18?s facilities director, Jeff Sheive, described his turf maintenance program, which emphasizes non-chemical methods to keep fields green and functional despite their heavy use by the school and community. School staff demonstrated how they repurposed a fertilizer spreader to spread grass seed. Experts from Cornell University and the University of Connecticut were on hand to demonstrate both newer and established methods to promote healthy turf growth. Sheive agreed to test out overseeding methods on three fields at Messalonskee Middle and High Schools noting the challenge of ?keeping our school grounds in good shape with a limited budget? spurs him to find creative solutions. The opportunity to try something new came in 2015 when Dr. Kathy Murray, a pest management specialist at the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry began collaborating on a USDA-funded research project lead by turfgrass researcher, Dr. Jenny Kao-Kniffen, at Cornell University. The aim of the project is to test the effectiveness of overseeding as an affordable means of improving field safety on 51 school sports fields in three different states. Although the study will not be completed until 2017, Murray said that overseeding is showing good promise. Participants at the Messalonskee workshop agreed that the overseeded half of each field had noticeably thicker grass with fewer weeds compared with the unseeded half. Fewer bare spots and weeds often leads to fewer sports-related injuries. Grass seed was donated for this project by Scotts. Other Maine schools participating in the overseeding research project are Gardiner Area High School, Halldale Middle and High Schools, Cony High School, Winslow Schools and Oakhill Middle School.

October 17, 2016 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 State officials credit LePage Administration tax change for helping make Maine greenhouses and nursery?s more competitive with the rest of the U.S. AUGUSTA ? USDA?s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) today reported that Maine horticulture sales have increased 43.6 % from $49.1 million (2009) to $70.5 million (2014). The number of Maine horticultural operations increased from 250 to 320, a 28% increase over the same time period. The 43.6% increase in sales experienced by Maine is more than double the national average increase of 18%. Maine state officials welcomed the news, while adding that a tax change policy proposed by the LePage Administration and supported by the 125th Maine Legislature (Law/Bill reference: PL 2011, c. 657, Part N), is helping fuel growth in the Maine horticulture industry. ?This is a perfect example of how business friendly tax policies are helping to grow Maine agriculture and jobs,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?For decades, the Maine horticulture industry sought the recognition and support its counterparts in the other 49 states received. The tax changes proposed by the LePage Administration and supported by legislative majorities in 2011, provided a sales tax refund on purchases of ?depreciable machinery or equipment used for commercial agriculture?in the commercial production of greenhouse and nursery products.? LePage Administration backed changes to the tax code support the hard work of Maine farmers who have more than doubled the impressive growth rate of U.S. horticulture over a 5-year period.? Maine Horticulture Statistics reported by NASS: ?In 2014, the United States had 23,221 horticultural operations that produced and sold $13.8 billion in floriculture, nursery, and other horticultural specialty products. Maine had 320 horticultural operations that sold $70.5 million in horticultural products in 2014, compared to 250 horticultural operations that sold $49.1 million in horticultural products in 2009. Horticulture producers in Maine had $66.7 million in total production expenses in 2014. Hired labor expenses in Maine accounted for 32 percent of the total production expenses. Of the 1,828 hired workers in Maine, 1,082 worked less than 150 days compared to 746 who worked 150 days or more.?

The Downeast Sunrise Trail (DEST) has now been completed with addition of the final two miles from Hancock into Ellsworth, after a quarter century of work. Commissioners from two collaborating state agencies and community partners will be on hand December 2 for a ceremonial ribbon cutting commemorating the event. The ceremony, hosted by the Sunrise Trail Coalition, Inc. and the City of Ellsworth, will take place at the new High Street Trailhead in Ellsworth on Friday at 11:00 a.m. The Downeast Sunrise Trail (aka Calais Branch Corridor Rehabilitation Project) was an interagency effort between MaineDOT and Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s (DACF) Bureau of Parks and Lands (BPL). MaineDOT owns the rail corridor and the BPL managed the construction, and will oversee continued maintenance of the multi-use recreation trail. The project has received support from several community partners and recreational groups. ?This is an example of Maine state government working with community partners to complete a project that will generate substantial economic activity and support Maine as a year-round destination,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?The ATV and snowmobile industries alone bring in over $500 million dollars to the State each year. Add to that the revenues that flow from its multi-use design and you have a significant resource for Maine people, visitors and the businesses that cater to them.? Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb and MaineDOT Commissioner David Bernhardt stressed the economic, recreational and its connection to the countries transportation system. ?Residents of Ellsworth and visitors will now have the opportunity to use a trail which directly links the City to the 87-mile recreational trail system,? said Commissioner Whitcomb. ?This is an easily maneuverable trail with gentle grades and a smooth solid base, which will provide users with the opportunity to engage in exercise to improve cardio-vascular health and reduce obesity. This trail links to 800-miles of ATV and snowmobile trails including ITS 81 and 82.? ?This new trail, part of Maine?s transportation network, will encourage trail users to visit Ellsworth?s local restaurants, lodging facilities, fuel stations, merchandise sales and other services,? said Commissioner Bernhardt. ?Having the trail head in the City of Ellsworth will entice tourists to visit this unique trail system. It is also is included in the East Coast Greenway which runs from Calais, Maine to Key West, Florida.? Down East Sunrise Trail (Calais Branch Corridor Rehabilitation Project): The project, begun in 1987, has been an interagency effort between MaineDOT and the DACF?s Bureau of Parks and Lands. It has been constructed in two phases. Phase I ? An 85- mile rail trail from Washington Junction, Hancock to Ayers Junction, Pembroke, opened in September 2010. This project preserved the rail corridor for future rail use, while in the interim providing a multi-use rail trail connecting multiple communities. The DACF was the lead agency in constructing this phase of the DEST. Construction of the trail was paid for with proceeds from the sale of the rail steel. Phase II ? ?Rail with trail? extended the 85-miles of existing rail trail 2 miles into Ellsworth. This provides trail users direct access to food, fuel, lodging, shopping and amenities. Phase II was also funded with proceeds from rail steel from Phase I and cost 1.3 million dollars. Plymouth Engineering designed both Phase I and Phase II. Lane Construction was the contractor for Phase II. Community Support: Numerous organizations and area clubs worked to make this project possible. These include: The Sunrise Trail Coalition, Inc., which represents the interests of the Trail multi-users, and through its membership dues, donations and grants sponsors annual community events and provides necessary accessory facilities like benches, picnic tables along the Trail. The Acadia Area ATV Club, which owns property with plans for a clubhouse in Hancock near the parking lot, entered into a trail use agreement which allows the trail to be built on their property. The Ellsworth Snowmobile Club will take care of grooming this section of the trail. The club will be working along with the Frenchmen?s Bay Snowmobile Club to assist with development of snowmobile access into and around Ellsworth area, with some trails already in place. Future maintenance and upkeep is being done by these clubs and managed by the DACF Off-road Vehicle Office. Clubs involved in maintaining the DEST from Ellsworth to Ayers Junction: - Downeast Trail Riders ATV & Snowmobile Club from East Machias - Dennysville Snowmobile & ATV Club from Dennysville - Narraguagus Snowmobile & ATV Club from Cherryfield - Ridge Riders Trail Club from Machias For more Downeast Sunrise Trail information go to: [http://www.maine.gov/downeastsunrisetrail](http://www.maine.gov/downeastsunrisetrail) or [http://www.sunrisetrail.org](http://www.sunrisetrail.org) Expansion of Search for Invasive Forest Pests Announced November 30, 2016 For more information contact: Karen Coluzzi at: (207) 287-7551 Outreach will encompass all 16 Maine Counties in effort to combat growing threat posed by invasive insects AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) announced two awards that will expand outreach to all 16 Maine counties in an effort to address the growing threat from invasive forest pests. The Maine Association of Conservation Districts Employees Committee and the Saco River Recreational Council received continued funding ($35,000 and $5,000, respectively) for their efforts to provide outreach and education to engage citizens in helping protect Maine forests. ?Early detection of invasive pests such as Asian longhorned beetle, emerald ash borer, hemlock woolly adelgid, winter moth and others are crucial in protecting the forest products and forest recreation industries in a state that is 90% forested,? said DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Once these insects have established a foothold in other states, they become difficult if not impossible to eradicate. By working in partnership with soil and water conservation districts in all 16 counties and community partners along the Saco River, we can better protect our forest resources and economies.? Early detection of invasive forest pets can be accomplished through outreach and education efforts. This not only reduces the costs and resources needed for a management response, but also increases the chances of eradication success. The DACF has been conducting outreach and education since 2009 with funding provided by the Farm Bill Section 10007. The Maine Association of Conservation Districts Employees Committee, in partnership with 12 county conservation districts in Southern and Central Maine, and the Saco River Recreational Council were both awarded funding under a competitive Request for Proposal issued by the DACF in 2015. This year?s awards continue the outreach provided by these organizations, expanding outreach to all 16 counties in Maine. ?The outreach and education that are being contributed by these two conservation organizations will enhance the Department?s existing efforts resulting in increased public understanding of the economic and environmental threats associated with invasive forest pests,? said Karen Coluzzi, DACF State Pest Survey Coordinator. ?The awards increase support for management and mitigation efforts, and increase reporting of potential pest sightings to federal or state authorities. The threat of invasive forest species requires continued vigilance, education and awareness of the general public to safeguard this significant state resource.?

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s (DACF) Division of Quality Assurance is notifying the public of the presence of skimmers in Maine, specifically, at gas stations throughout the state. The decision to alert the public comes amidst reports of illegal gas station skimmers found by law enforcement in Brewer, Maine just this week. Similar reports in Maine have implicated drive-through tellers at financial institutions, ATMs and restaurants. DACF inspectors that check gas station pumps for accuracy also search for skimmers in an effort to help protect the public against a growing problem. ?In response to national reports and local concerns, Maine inspectors have been working with gas station owners and actively looking for illegal skimmers since early last year,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Unfortunately, this criminal activity has spread to Maine. The public should learn of the risk, take additional steps to protect their financial information from thieves and alert law enforcement of any suspicious activity.? In early 2015, department inspectors were alerted to the potential for motor fuel skimmers in Maine following national reports of increasing discoveries in other states. ?Through our contacts with other states, we learned of the growing problem of gas station skimmers,? said Steve Giguere, Acting Director of the Division of Quality and Assurance. ?Since that time, we have been alerting our inspectors and working with station owners in anticipation of their eventual presence in Maine. Sadly, skimmers have been found in Maine and we need to work together to raise awareness and help protect consumers.? Since early 2015, inspectors have been provided with: - News accounts from other states involving gas station skimmers - Presentations developed by other states addressing the problem - Overviews of data skimmers in motor fuel dispensers - Procedural guides for when suspected gasoline skimmers are discovered - FBI generated information on skimmers - Tips on how consumers and station owners can protect themselves According to economic loss data derived from Dr. Sergio Alvarez, Chief Economist for Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H. Putnam: - The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) estimates that each victim of account takeover fraud experiences approximately $1,103 in direct and indirect losses - Industry estimates suggest that there are roughly 100 card numbers on each skimmer found - The rough estimate of direct and indirect economic loss in $110,300 per skimmer For more information about the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, go to: www.maine.gov/dacf Pets and Holidays! December 22, 2016 For more information contact: Michele Walsh, State Veterinarian, Liam Hughes, AWP Director at: 207-287-7615, 207-287-5531 Tips from the State Veterinarian and Animal Welfare Program Director AUGUSTA - The holiday season can be an exciting, active time for Maine families and their pets. State officials offer some helpful tips for pet owners and those expanding their families to include new pets. These pointers aim to help avoid stressful visits to the veterinary emergency room. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s State Veterinarian and Director of Animal Welfare are urging Mainers to consider the following: BEFORE ACQUIRING A NEW PET: During the holidays, families often consider obtaining a new pet. Animal Welfare Director Liam Hughes recommends doing some basic research ahead of time, considering that pets require a long-term commitment. ?Pets owners need to be ready for a long-term emotional and financial commitment,? said Hughes. ?Before adopting or purchasing a new pet, people should consider a number of things, including: does my/our lifestyle allow time for a pet; what type of pet; and what are the costs associated with a pet? If you are looking for a pet in Maine, search animal shelters, pet stores, or breeders that are licensed by the state. Don?t buy animals on the side of the road or in a parking lot since you cannot meet and evaluate the appropriateness of that pet for your household ahead of time. Beware of online sales for the same reason ? and because you might not get what was advertised.? Tips for adopting a new pet: - Work with a reputable local humane society whenever possible. - Meet with the pet prior to adopting it to ensure that its behavior and demeanor are a good match for your family. - Obtain a copy of the animal?s medical record, vaccination history, and Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (health certificate). - Ensure that the dog or cat is vaccinated for rabies if it is three months of age or older. - If working with a rescue organization, ensure that it is properly registered and licensed in the state of Maine and in the state where the business is based, and/or with USDA Animal Care. Mainers can contact the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Animal Welfare Program at (207) 287-3846 for more information on which animal rescue and breeding organizations are appropriately registered. HELPING PETS AVOID DANGER: ?Healthy pets make happy owners. We want all Mainers and their pets to have a positive experience this holiday season,? said Maine State Veterinarian, Dr. Michele Walsh. ?A little bit of forethought can go a long way toward avoiding stressful, expensive, possibly fatal trips to a veterinarian. The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) and other organizations offer tips on how to help ensure that your pets make it through the holidays safely.? The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) website (http://www.avma.org/public/PetCare/Pages/holidays.aspx) offers the following Holiday Pet Safety tips: Food Keep people food away from pets. If you want to share holiday treats with your pets, make or buy treats formulated just for them. The following people foods are especially hazardous for pets: - Chocolate is an essential part of the holidays for many people, but it is toxic to dogs and cats. Although the toxicity can vary based on the type of chocolate, the size of your pet, and the amount they ate, it?s safer to consider all chocolate off limits for pets. - Other sweets and baked goods also should be kept out of reach. Not only are they often too rich for pets; an artificial sweetener often found in baked goods, candy and chewing gum, xylitol, has been linked to liver failure and death in dogs. - Turkey and turkey skin ? sometimes even in small amounts ? can cause a life-threatening condition in pets known as pancreatitis. - Table scraps ? including gravy and meat fat ?also should be kept away from pets. Many foods that are healthy for people are poisonous to pets, including onions, raisins and grapes. During the holidays, when our own diets tend toward extra-rich foods, table scraps can be especially fattening and hard for animals to digest and can cause pancreatitis. - Yeast dough can cause problems for pets, including painful gas and potentially dangerous bloating. Quick action can save lives. If you believe your pet has been poisoned or eaten something it shouldn?t have, call your veterinarian or local veterinary emergency clinic immediately. You may also want to call the ASPCA Poison Control Hotline: 1-888-426-4435. Signs of pet distress include: sudden changes in behavior, depression, pain, vomiting, or diarrhea. Decorating Greenery, lights and Christmas trees can make the holidays festive, but they also pose risky temptations for our pets. - Christmas trees can tip over if pets climb on them or try to play with the lights and ornaments. Consider tying your tree to the ceiling or a doorframe using fishing line to secure it. - Ornaments can cause hazards for pets. Broken ornaments can cause injuries, and ingested ornaments can cause intestinal blockage or even toxicity. Keep any homemade ornaments, particularly those made from salt-dough or other food-based materials, out of reach of pets. - Tinsel and other holiday decorations also can be tempting for pets to eat. Consuming them can cause intestinal blockages, sometimes requiring surgery. Breakable ornaments or decorations can cause injuries. - Flowers and festive plants can result in an emergency veterinary visit if your pet gets hold of them. Amaryllis, mistletoe, balsam, pine, cedar, and holly are among the common holiday plants that can be dangerous and even poisonous to pets who decide to eat them. Poinsettias can be troublesome as well. The ASPCA offers lists of plants that are toxic to dogs and cats. - Candles are attractive to pets as well as people. Never leave a pet alone in an area with a lit candle; it could result in a fire. - Potpourris should be kept out of reach of inquisitive pets. Liquid potpourris pose risks because they contain essential oils and cationic detergents that can severely damage your pet?s mouth, eyes and skin. Solid potpourris could cause problems if eaten. Hosting Parties and Visitors Visitors can upset pets, as can the noise and excitement of holiday parties. Even pets that aren?t normally shy may become nervous in the hubbub that can accompany a holiday gathering. The following tips will reduce emotional stress on your pet and protect your guests from possible injury. - All pets should have access to a comfortable, quiet place inside if they want to retreat. Make sure your pet has a room or crate somewhere away from the commotion, where your guests won?t follow, that it can go to anytime it wants to get away. - Inform your guests ahead of time that you have pets or if other guests may be bringing pets to your house. Guests with allergies or compromised immune systems (due to pregnancy, disease, or medications/ treatments that suppress the immune system) need to be aware of the pets (especially exotic pets) in your home so they can take any needed precautions to protect themselves. - Guests with pets? If guests ask to bring their own pets and you don?t know how the pets will get along, you should either politely decline their request or plan to spend some time acclimating the pets to each other, supervising their interactions, monitoring for signs of a problem, and taking action to avoid injuries to pets or people. - Pets that are nervous around visitors should be put it in another room or a crate with a favorite toy. If your pet is particularly upset by houseguests, talk to your veterinarian about possible solutions to this common problem. - Exotic pets make some people uncomfortable and may themselves be more easily stressed by gatherings. Keep exotic pets safely away from the hubbub of the holidays. - Watch the exits. Even if your pets are comfortable around guests, make sure you watch them closely, especially when people are entering or leaving your home. While you?re welcoming hungry guests and collecting coats, a four-legged family member may make a break for it out the door and become lost. - Identification tags and microchips reunite families. Make sure your pet has proper identification with your current contact information ? particularly a microchip with up-to-date, registered information. That way, if they do sneak out, they?re more likely to be returned to you. If your pet isn?t already microchipped, talk to your veterinarian about the benefits of this simple procedure. - Clear the food from your table, counters and serving areas when you are done using them ? and make sure the trash gets put where your pet can?t reach it. A turkey or chicken carcass or other large quantities of meat sitting out on the carving table, or left in a trash container that is easily opened, could be deadly to your family pet. Dispose of carcasses and bones ? and anything used to wrap or tie the meat, such as strings, bags and packaging ? in a covered, tightly secured trash bag placed in a closed trash container outdoors (or behind a closed, locked door). - Trash also should be cleared away where pets can?t reach it ? especially sparkly ribbon and other packaging or decorative items that could be tempting for your pet to play with or consume. When You Leave the House - Unplug decorations while you're not around. Cats, dogs and other pets are often tempted to chew electrical cords. - Take out the trash to make sure your pets can?t get to it, especially if it contains any food or food scraps.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) has adopted rules to prohibit the sale and distribution of thirty-three terrestrial plants that were deemed invasive. The plants were reviewed by a specially-convened committee of horticulture professionals, land managers, foresters, wildlife biologists and other scientists. The new rule went into effect on January 14, 2017, but the prohibition of sales does not begin until January 1, 2018. ?The plants on this list have invaded farms, fields, forests and wetlands throughout the state,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Although many were originally promoted with good intentions, such as, the prevention of soil erosion or to support wildlife, they have spread throughout Maine to the detriment of native species. In many places they have come to dominate forests, wetlands, fields and local landscapes, excluding native plants that support our economy and natural areas.? ?The Maine Forest Service, Public Lands and the Natural Areas Program have joined with the Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources to locate and eradicate invasive plant and animal species,? said Doug Denico, Maine State Forester. ?The Public Lands are a major focus of current efforts, with education of the public also a critical undertaking in order to extend the department?s statewide effectiveness.? ?All but three of the prohibited plants have been, or continue to be sold in the nursery trade, said Gary Fish, Maine State Horticulturist. ?Some of them have already been discontinued by nurseries which recognized their harmful potential. Three are not intentionally sold, but are ?horticultural hitchhikers? which sprout as weeds in the pots and rootballs of plants sold in the nursery trade. A few of the plants are still in some demand, including Japanese barberry, burning bush, privet and Norway maple, especially the crimson king variety. Maine nurseries and garden centers will have until January 1, 2018, to sell stock already on hand.? Many non-invasive alternatives are available to help homeowners and nursery professionals satisfy their landscape needs without using the invasive plants on the list.

Project Canopy, the Maine Forest Service?s community forestry program, recently awarded $116,939 in grants to local governments and municipalities, educational institutions and non-profit organizations that support community efforts to develop and maintain long-term community forestry programs. In all, seventeen awards were made for planning/Education and planting/maintenance. The Project Canopy grants are funded by the U.S. Forest Service. ?These awards support community forestry programs growing trees that both enhance quality of life and that have multiple uses in the Maine economy,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Urban forestry can also help raise awareness of professional forest practices being practiced on a larger scale throughout Maine. According to Project Canopy Director Jan Ames Santerre, the awards were selected from a total 21 applications ? 7 from new communities and organizations, with grant requests totaling $155,714. ?These grants not only support significant community forestry projects, but they also support and create jobs throughout the state in the green industry, including nurseries, landscapers, foresters and loggers,? said Santerre. Planning Grants were awarded to: - City of Auburn - $9,000 - City of Biddeford - $10,000 - City of Sanford - $5,000 - Greenways Center, Belfast - $6,290 - McLaughlin Foundation - $6,000 - Somerset Woods Trustees - $5,645 - Town of Camden - $10,000 - Town of North Berwick- $6,642 - Town of Veazie - $7,190 Planting grants were awarded to: - City of Portland - $5,000 - Teresa C. Hamilin School, Randolph - $1,809 - Town of Alfred - $8,000 - Town of Machias - $8,000 - Town of Scarborough - $8,000 - Town of Standish - $8,000 - Town of Yarmouth - $6,000 - Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve - $6,364 Some Projects: Machias has created a plan for bringing native trees to the downtown - an area nearly barren of native vegetation, consisting of parking lots, business buildings, utility poles and wires ? to welcome residents and visitors alike. The entire community will become a part of the planting, including students from the local high school agricultural program; members of the Machias Rotary Club, Machias Bay Chamber of Commerce and other civic groups; business owners, sorority and fraternity members at the University of Maine at Machias, and the JMG classes at Machias Memorial High School. Younger students will also be invited to participate in tree planting days as part of agricultural and civic engagement education. This initiative is part of a multi-year downtown revitalization program that Machias is undertaking. Other projects under way or planned for the near future include an Edible Garden, upgrade of walking trails along the river, lighting and enhancements at Bad Little Falls and an upgrade of sidewalks and street lighting. Randolph?s Teresa C. Hamlin School (TCH) is a small elementary school located in the town of Randolph, Maine serving students in grades pre-K through 5. As the only school in Randolph and one of the few public buildings, students and community members alike take advantage of the centrally-located school campus, but there is not a spot of shade to be found on a sunny day. With this grant from Project Canopy, they will plant eight new trees to provide shade as well as a living educational tool for students and their families. The trees will provide ample opportunity for nature-based education, including lessons around soil, plant needs, and tree propagation, followed by lessons on seed dispersal, plant parts, and ecosystems as the trees develop. Apple trees will soon bear fruit that will be made into applesauce by the students. Alfred - Decades ago, the Town of Alfred planted 9 trees ? crabapples and Norway maples ? in the town square. It?s unclear if the original planters were aware of the nature of those trees, but what is clear now is that they need to be removed. Alfred plans to replace those aging trees, along with two old maples near the library, with disease resistant elms and native sugar maples, one again bringing shade to the town square of this great classic New England village adjacent to so many historic homes. Project Canopy: Is a program of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Maine Forest Service. It encourages communities to develop project proposals that support sustainable community forestry management, increase awareness of the benefits of trees and forests, and increase the health and livability of communities through sound tree planting and maintenance. Project Canopy is funded by the USDA Forest Service Community Forestry Assistance Program. The USDA Forest Service Urban and Community Forestry Program was established to promote natural resource management in populated areas and improve quality of life. Since 2003, Project Canopy has awarded more than $1.5 million in funding for community forestry projects. The average grants range from $6,000 to $8,000 and require a 50-percent cost-share with cash or in-kind services. Project Canopy Assistance Grants are available to state, county, and municipal governments, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations for developing and implementing community forestry projects and programs. Planting projects increase the health and livability of communities through sound tree planting and maintenance, while planning and education projects support sustainable community forestry management, and efforts to increase awareness of the benefits of trees and forests.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) is tracking Maine lake ?Ice-Out.? This annual effort provides boaters, anglers and other outdoor enthusiasts with information, data and resources to help plan outdoor adventures on Maine lakes. It is available for spring 2017 and for previous years on an Ice-Out webpage maintained by the Department. The public is invited to assist this effort by reporting ice-out dates for water bodies throughout the state. ?Maine is open year-round for outdoor recreation,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Ice-Out is a sure sign that spring is here and is eagerly awaited by boaters, anglers and outdoor enthusiasts looking to explore Maine lakes and waterways. Residents and visitors can help plan their next trip with information on current conditions and historical data on ice-out dates for lakes throughout Maine on one webpage.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb stressed that collection of the historic data available is greatly assisted by public participation. ?The amount and accuracy of historical data collected as part of this annual effort is greatly enhanced by people that contact the department to report ice-out dates on individual lakes and waterways. By reporting current conditions and then recording traditional ice-out dates, it is possible to project ice-out dates. I encourage people to visit the department Ice-Out page and explore what is available.? This Year?s Ice-Out Dates Although the winter of 2016/2017 has brought a lot of snow to most of Maine, lake ice conditions are considered to be normal or below normal in ice thickness. A heavy blanket of snow has covered most of our lakes since early December insulating the ice and has generally reduced the ice quality and thickness throughout Maine. Many areas that may typically see more than 4' of ice late in the season are currently covered by 24-30? of ice and much of that is \"soft\" ice meaning it is very porous. A late season cold snap may change conditions but if the current weather pattern continues, lakes covered with ice should go out when they normally do. Ice-Out Webpage: [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/wateractivities/boating/iceout_dates.shtml](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/water_activities/boating/ice_out_dates.shtml) Webpage Resources: - Current conditions report ? You can also sign up to receive ice?out email updates - Ice-Out dates from previous years - Ice-Out dates for a specific lake or town can be searched or the date ice was reported out Public Participation Encouraged: The public is encouraged to make the page as accurate as possible by sending a quick email when the ice goes out in their area to timothy.thurston@maine.gov . People should include the name of the water body, town(s) and the ice out date in your email and it will be posted as soon as possible. What's Ice Out? Department?s web page considers \"ice-out\" to be when you can navigate unimpeded from one end of the water body to the other. There may still be ice in coves or along the shoreline in some areas but when a person can traverse the entire water body without being stopped by ice floes, the department considers the ice to be out.

Responding to the broad public interest and possible implications to animal welfare laws, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) and its Animal Welfare Program has offered to assist the Maine District Court in Waterville with the case of State of Maine v. Matthew D. Perry, No. VI-17-20053 scheduled for a hearing tomorrow, April 11, 2017. The case involves a husky dog named Dakota that was scheduled to be put to death and subsequently given a ?full and free pardon? by Maine Governor Paul R. LePage on March 30, 2017. Although the DACF is not a party to the lawsuit, it is seeking to express its strong interest in the matter and offer assistance to the Court prior to the rendering of a final disposition. At the request of the Department, the Maine Office of the Attorney General conveyed that offer to the District Court in a letter dated April 7, 2017. The letter can be viewed here: [http://maine.gov/dacf/about/news/DACF-Dakota.pdf](http://maine.gov/dacf/about/news/DACF-Dakota.pdf) and contains the following points: - DACF seeks to ensure that animal owners are afforded due process and a fair chance to defend themselves and their animals; - The purpose of the animal welfare laws is to safeguard the humane and proper treatment of animals. DACF has a strong interest in holding the original owner(s) responsible and ensuring that animals do not suffer due to owner neglect; - The intent of the dangerous dog statute is to protect the public by deterring owners of dangerous dogs from letting them loose. It is not intended as a punishment for a dog, in this case Dakota; and - Dakota is less of a public safety risk given the reliability of the SAFER behavioral testing conducted on Dakota by the Waterville Area Humane Society. The letter goes on to say that the DACF is ready and willing to provide additional information to assist the Court with its consideration of the case, as the Court determines appropriate. Maine Greenhouse and Nursery Day is Saturday, May 6! April 24, 2017 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 Annual event heralds the arrival of spring AUGUSTA ?

LePage Administration backed changes to the tax code support the hard work of horticultural professionals who have more than doubled the impressive growth rate of U.S. horticulture over a 5-year period.? The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry licenses and provides technical assistance to more than 1,340 businesses selling plants in Maine. To support this growing industry, the Department certifies plant exports, regulates imported plants and assists growers with plant pest problems. Maine Greenhouse and Nursery Day is supported by the Ornamental Horticulture Council and the Mid-Maine Greenhouse Growers Association. Maine Horticulture Statistics reported by NASS in 2016: ?In 2014, the United States had 23,221 horticultural operations that produced and sold $13.8 billion in floriculture, nursery, and other horticultural specialty products. Maine had 320 horticultural operations that sold $70.5 million in horticultural products in 2014, compared to 250 horticultural operations that sold $49.1 million in horticultural products in 2009. Horticulture producers in Maine had $66.7 million in total production expenses in 2014. Hired labor expenses in Maine accounted for 32 percent of the total production expenses.

Projects will be funded in the following categories: - Conservation and recreational lands - Farmland protection - Public access to Maine Waters, for boating, fishing and swimming Proposals that seek to protect Deer Wintering Areas will receive priority consideration in scoring. These are habitat areas that provide shelter and food for white-tailed deer during months of severe cold and deep snow. This new emphasis on deer habitat originated in the statute which authorized the bond funds approved by voters in 2012. At its May 16 meeting, the Board adopted guidelines for this funding round. Applicants are encouraged to read the ?Proposal Workbook,? which provides detailed instructions on program requirements, proposal submission and the scoring and evaluation process. The revised 2017 Workbook is posted on the LMF website at [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf/index.shtml](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf/index.shtml) Proposals will be accepted by the LMF program until 5:00 PM, September 1, 2017. Eligible applicants include cities, towns and counties, state agencies and non-profit land conservation organizations. All proposals must be sponsored by one of the following state agencies: Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife or Maine Historic Preservation Commission. The LMF program works with citizens, land trusts, businesses, municipalities, nonprofit organizations, and federal and state agencies to identify special lands to accomplish the State's goals for resource conservation and protection of working forests, farms and waterfronts. The program is administered by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and is supported by bonds approved by Maine voters.

The Maine Forest Service is cautioning towns and residents against using third-party, non-sanctioned online burn permit systems after at least two fires occurred this spring. The fires likely would not have resulted if the officially sanctioned state online burn permit system had been used instead of that of a third party. On June 8, about eighty letters were mailed out to Town Managers and Fire Chiefs that use privately based online burn permit systems. It requested that each community ?immediately discontinue its use of these (privately owned electronic burn permit) systems.? Most have already complied and are utilizing the official state system (www.maineburnpermit.com) that has been in place since 2005, issuing over 88,000 online burn permits. Initially, most towns adhered to the letter and stopped using the privately owned online burn permit systems. This week, some of the subscribers to the privately owned online burn permit systems have allowed burn permits to be issued. With the 4th of July Holiday weekend approaching, the Maine Forest Service is concerned about escaped brush pile fires and the use of illegal burn permits. In the past, there have been a lot of wildfires during the 4th of July weekend. State fire safety officials have learned that at least one system has continued to issue permits despite the notification that their system is not legal under current Maine state law. The Maine Forest Service issued the letter based on a recent review of the legality of the privately owned online burn permit systems by the State Attorney General?s Office. In short, the law only allows state owned online burn permit systems to be used. Maine towns and residents are warned not to use the illegal third-party systems because: -There is a question about liability should a permit issued by a privately owned system result in an escaped wildfire that destroys property or causes injury and or death -A burn permit is a legal document required to be administered by the Maine Forest Service, who authorizes town fire wardens to issue permits based on local conditions -If the state system is not used, it is possible that the person with no background or training in fire safety may approve the permit THE DANGER OF PRIVATE SYSTEMS: Several brush pile burns issued through privately owned systems have escaped. The most recent fire occurred in the town of China on April 15, 2017, when an escaped fire burned a barn and an apartment. The fire also knocked down power lines in the area. SEE: [http://www.centralmaine.com/2017/04/15/fire-destroys-barn-apartment-in-china/](http://www.centralmaine.com/2017/04/15/fire-destroys-barn-apartment-in-china/) Another fire occurred when a person, using a privately owned online burn permit system, had the fire escape and burn one acre in Litchfield on April 14, 2016. That fire threatened two structures and resulted in a summons for the landowner. In both cases, the wildfires occurred because the permits through the privately owned online systems were issued during the day, which is when most escaped fires occur. In 2012, careless issuing of permits through a private online system resulted in a wildfire in a town in central Maine. According to the Ranger, the Fire Chief ?forgot to turn off the permit system? and allowed it to issue electronic burn permits on a class 3 (high fire danger) day in the fall. One of the fires escaped and the local Fire Dept. was called in to contain it. This would not have happened with the state system, because it automatically shuts down on a class three or higher day. The Maine Forest Service online burn permit system does not allow burning until after 5pm, when the winds die down and the temperature drops. If these citizens used the state system, it is likely that the escaped fires would not have occurred. There are only two ways to obtain a valid permit in Maine. One is a paper permit provided to towns by the Maine Forest Service at no cost. The other is through an online system developed by the Director of the Maine Forest Service. Municipalities can adopt additional permits through ordinance, but the Maine Forest Service permit is still required. No other permit is authorized by statute and individuals burning without one of the two Maine Forest Service permits are in violation of Maine law and may be responsible to pay suppression costs should their fire escape. It is proven to be a safe and convenient system and has greatly improved our fire prevention efforts. The system only allows burning on class 1 or 2 days after 5pm, when the risk of an escaped fire is lower. It should be noted that escaped brush piles are the leading cause of wildfires in Maine. The Maine online burn permit system allows Forest Rangers and Town Fire Wardens monitor all permits issued via email or text messaging. In the event that fire conditions change, they also have the ability to shut the system down temporarily, block unauthorized users and increase the restrictions listed on the permit. Although the permits cost $7.00 each, the permit is valid over a 48 hour period and $2.00 from every permit goes back to the town. The intension of the revenue sharing is to benefit the fire departments, but it is up to the town how the money is used.

July 6, 2017 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 Initial reports: increased attendance over last year, despite a government shutdown AUGUSTA ? Maine State Parks are reporting that there was strong attendance during the first four days of July 2017 at Reid, Range Pond and Crescent Beach State Parks. When the figures for all Maine state parks are finalized, it is believed that they will exceed the number of visitors during a similar period in July 2016. Governor Paul R. LePage, who kept Maine State Parks and historic sites open during the recent government shutdown, was quick to praise state employees for their efforts to ensure that visitors enjoyed the parks, incident ?free, during the Independence Day holiday. ?I wish to publicly thank Maine state employees, in this case Bureau of Parks and Lands employees, for their service and professionalism in the face of a difficult situation,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Amidst a government shutdown, during one of the busiest times of the year, they safely handled more visitors than last year. Their efforts are a testament to the commitment, dedication and talents of Maine State employees. Because of them, the holiday vacation plans and public safety of Maine residents and out-of-state guests were not compromised.?

July 13, 2017 For more information contact: Samantha Howard, John Bott at: 207-287-7620, 207-287-3156 Participating farms will open their gates to the public AUGUSTA ? Over 80 Maine farms will be open to the public on Sunday, July 23, for the 28th annual Open Farm Day. Open Farm Day is an opportunity for consumers to learn about Maine food producers and for farms to show the public their products. Participating farms are generally open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. \"This is an exciting time for Maine-made products and Maine agriculture,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Maine?s 8,200 farm operations provide wholesome foods, thousands of jobs and over $740 million in farm receipts, not including direct sales at farms or farmers markets. The recent success of Maine farms, as well as the hard work that produces locally-grown food, can be experienced firsthand on Open Farm Day.? Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb urged families to visit local farms on Open Farm Day. ?Maine farm families have a history of agricultural productivity and provide a rich diversity of agricultural crops not seen on a commercial scale in the rest of New England,? said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. ?Our state is notable for the number of farms, new farmers, artisanal cheesemakers and its support for farmers markets and agricultural fairs.? Open Farm Day is an annual family event that connects consumers with the men and women who help produce their food. Farms throughout Maine will open their gates to offer the public an opportunity to learn about the business of agriculture. Many farms will have demonstrations, displays, animals, crops and farm-raised products for sale. Activities may include: barn and field tours, milking, hay rides, nature trails, beautiful scenery, samples for tasting, refreshments and animals to view.

This October, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s (DACF) Board of Pesticides Control (BPC) will team up with the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to help Mainers dispose of unusable and waste pesticides. The Obsolete Pesticides Collection Program, jointly sponsored by the BPC and DEP, and funded through pesticide product registration fees, has kept more than 99 tons of pesticides out of the waste stream since its start in 1982. This free annual program is open to homeowners, family-owned farms and greenhouses. Collections will occur at four sites: Presque Isle, Bangor, Augusta, and Portland. Participants must pre-register by September 29, 2017. Drop-ins are not permitted. The collected chemicals will be taken to out-of-state disposal facilities licensed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency where they are incinerated or reprocessed. Pesticides may become unusable due to age, freezing or evaporation, or because their legal registration changes. It is important to remember that the term ?pesticides? includes not only insecticides, but also herbicides, fungicides and rodenticides. Past participants in the program have reported finding obsolete pesticides in barns of inherited properties, garages of newly purchased homes and other unexpected places. Governor Paul R. LePage is urging Mainers to take advantage of this opportunity to protect the environment and save money through this once a year collection event that highlights cooperation between government agencies. ?This is an opportunity for Mainers to dispose of unusable pesticides properly and at no expense,? said Governor LePage. ?Through consolidated collections at four central locations and the use of in-house resources and expertise, disposal costs are reduced to about $2 per pound. That is a great value for Maine taxpayers lowers costs and helps protect the environment.? DACF Commissioner Walt Whitcomb is encouraging Mainers to seize this free opportunity for pesticide disposal. ?This program provides essential protection of the public, wildlife, and environment. Pesticides thrown in the trash or poured down the drain contaminate drinking water and cause environmental damage,? said Commissioner Whitcomb. ?I urge people storing these products to contact the BPC and register as soon as possible for the October program.? ?Providing Maine residents with a free and easy solution to properly dispose of pesticides gives everyone an opportunity to make a positive impact on our environment and public health,? said Paul Mercer, DEP Commissioner. To register, get details, and learn important information about the temporary storage and transportation of obsolete pesticides, go to the BPC Web site at [thinkfirstspraylast.org](http://thinkfirstspraylast.org), or call 207-287-2731. - For more information on the Maine Board of Pesticides Control, go to: [thinkfirstspraylast.org](http://www.thinkfirstspraylast.org). - For more information on the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, go to: [maine.gov/dep](http://www.maine.gov/dep) # Important Note to the Media: Since pre-registration is required, please post any information from this release as soon as possible. This will allow adequate time for participants and the Board of Pesticides Control to process applications. Thank you for your help in getting the word out! Support for Maine Specialty Crops!

Maine Potato Board - Evaluating Alternative Crops in Potato Production System - $100,000 Summary: The Maine Potato Board has taken a lead role in researching and promoting alternative crops that can be grown in conjunction with potatoes with the goals of improving economic returns to the grower, providing options for growers to expand current crop rotation lengths, and directly and indirectly improving potato yields. They will receive funding to build on the results from the previously funded two-year Specialty Crop Block Grant ?Improving Maine Potato Yields through Increased Rotation Lengths and Improved Rotation Crop Profitability? in an effort to develop an informational resource for growers interested in diversifying their cropping systems. This project will continue to experiment and evaluate novel cropping systems, marketing options for alternative crops, and quantify the effect these crops have on potato quality and quantity. University of Maine System - Microbial safety and quality of Maine maple syrup: Influence of production and handling practices - $19,932 Summary: This partnership with the Maine Agricultural & Forest Experiment Station and University of Maine Cooperative Extension (divisions of the University of Maine System acting through the University of Maine) will receive funding to address microbial quality and safety of Maine maple syrup. This project will reduce product loss and evaluate risk of potential mycotoxin production due to fungal contamination by defining processing steps needed to inactivate fungal contaminants during production and packaging of syrup. It will also generate previously unavailable data regarding the fate of Listeria monocytogenes during syrup production and packaging that will assist producers with preparation of FDA food safety plans. University of Maine System - Development of Advance Phosphorous Recommendations for Maine Potato Growers - $91,432 Summary: The University of Maine Cooperative Extension will receive funding to develop soil and climate based phosphorus (P) recommendations, to improve nutrient use efficiency and reduce grower?s input cost with environmental issues as well e.g. eutrophication of lakes and rivers due to P pollution. Objectives of this study are to create robust grower specific P recommendations, with multiple sites that will include varied soil textures, soil moisture, and weather conditions. Yield, quality, soil moisture, weather data, P uptake, tissue sampling, and soil physical, chemical, and biological data will be used for this study. A ground-based active optical (GBAO) sensor will be used to monitor plant health, and adjust fertilizer application, which may help in developing yield prediction models. There will be significant outcomes from this study. An online mobile application will be prepared where growers will be able to access required P rates for his field using maximum yield potential, soil type, and closest weather station. It will help in managing P variably, which will benefit in reducing its application rates. Since recommendations will be economical using potato size, and other quality parameters, growers will be able to decide whether additional P application will improve their revenue. University of Maine System - Optimizing inputs for wild blueberry weed and disease integrated management (IPM) - $99,200 Summary: The Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine (WBC) in collaboration with the University of Maine will receive funding for determining Optimizing inputs for wild blueberry weed and disease integrated management (IPM) for Maine?s 510 wild blueberry growers with 44,000 acres of commercial production. Wild Blueberry growers have consistently ranked controlling weeds and diseases as two of their top concerns for sustaining crop production and yield. If funded, this project will continue to: 1) evaluate herbicides and identify the best material and timings that will provide the most cost effective control of weed species, 2) evaluate fungicides and timings to control mummy berry and leaf spots to provide the most cost effective control of these diseases. This program will also educate growers on how to manage diseases and weeds by rotating or combining pesticides to provide the most cost effective controls to prevent yield reductions. Growers will be surveyed at educational sessions to determine understanding and adoption of the disease and weed management strategies evaluated in this program. Since 2006, the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, which is administered by the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), has awarded over $4.5 million dollars through the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry as funds that go directly to support the growing number of Maine specialty crop producers who are selling into local and regional markets.

With the 2017 hunting season underway, Governor Paul R. LePage is again urging Maine hunters to consider supporting the Hunters for the Hungry Program by donating all or part of their harvest to feed families in need. The popular program provides a means for Maine hunters, as well as hunters from other states, to donate harvested game to food pantries, soup kitchens, and shelter. ?The Hunters for the Hungry Program is an opportunity for hunters to help families in need while participating in a traditional Maine outdoor sport,? said Governor LePage. ?Donations provide meat to food pantries, soup kitchens and shelters. This effort is successful because of the dedication and generosity of Maine hunters and their support of organizations working to end hunger in Maine.? Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Walt Whitcomb noted that since its establishment in 1996, the Hunters for the Hungry Program has provided thousands of nutritious meals to people across the state. ?Since 1996, Maine sportsmen and women have contributed to a program that provides nutritious meals to people across Maine,? said Whitcomb. ?The Hunters for the Hungry Program puts high quality, native protein on the tables of Maine families.? The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry distributes many types of donations to food pantries, soup kitchens and shelters. The Hunters for the Hungry Program is part of the Department?s Emergency Food Assistance Program. It is done in cooperation with the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife?s wardens, Maine State Troopers and hunters, all working towards a common goal of helping fellow Mainers. The program accepts bear, deer and moose donations. Road kill donations are also accepted, provided the meat is not damaged. Hunters do not pay for the processing of donated meat. Meat processing costs are paid for by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry or the charity that receives the food. Hunters choosing to keep their game can still donate a few pounds to the program. Meat processors that are interested in getting involved with the program and learning how it works should call 207-287-7513. For more information, to donate, or to get connected to a Hunters for the Hungry participating meat processor call 207-287-7513.

The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Maine Forest Service announced that a new species of wasp has been found in Maine. Hillary Morin Peterson of Brunswick Maine discovered a new species of Pteromalidae wasp while conducting her thesis work in collaboration with the Maine Forest Service. The new discovery is detailed in a recently published paper. Hillary named the wasp after the motto of her home state of Maine, Ormocerus dirigoius Morin & Gates. Hillary was born and raised in Maine, before attending and graduating from the University of Maine. In addition to supporting her thesis work, the Maine Forest Service also supported her continued research at the Smithsonian. She is now a graduate student in the Department of Entomology at Penn State University. Ormocerus dirigoius Ormocerus dirigoius, the new species of wasp (pictured), is about 2.7 mm long (the size of a grain of rice). These tiny, non-stinging wasps actually have nothing to do with winter moth but were swept up as by-catch. They are in a genus that are believed to be either parasitoids of gall inducing cynipid wasps or inqulines (that kill the gall inducers by outcompeting them for the gall tissue that they eat). Little is known about the biology of O. dirigoius, although it may be associated with galls on red oak trees. The specimens were all collected in oak dominated forest stands and four specimens were collected from beatings of oak trees. Hillary?s senior honors thesis was on research into the relationship between predatory and parasitoid Hymenoptera (wasps) and the invasive winter moth species (Operophtera brumata) inside and outside of the infestation area in Harpswell, Maine. In order to learn more about identifying wasps, Hillary attended the Hymenoptera Blitz at Acadia National Park in 2015 with financial support from the Maine Entomological Society and carpooled to the Blitz with Dr. Robert Kula. Hillary continued identifying the Hymenoptera after she graduated and was able to secure an internship in Dr. Kula?s lab, where she met and also collaborated with Dr. Michael Gates at the Smithsonian to further her work.

November 27, 2017 For more information contact: Charlene Donahue at: 207-287-2431 Parasitic flies to be released as biocontrol, public assistance sought, to control invasive winter moth SOUTH PORTLAND - Entomologists at the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry?s Maine Forest Service (MFS) are gearing up for winter moth with two initiatives. On Wednesday, November 29th they will be setting out parasitic flies (Cyzenis albicans) in South Portland as part of a biocontrol project to control the invasive winter moth (Operophtera brumata). The MFS is also encouraging the public to report winter moth sightings through an online survey: [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/wintermothsurvey](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/wintermothsurvey) WHAT: Setting out parasitic flies as part of a biocontrol project to combat winter moth The flies are currently in cocoons for the winter and will be set out in a cage buried in the ground until spring. In early May when the flies start to emerge the cage will be opened to release them to go to work on the winter moth. WHEN: 11:00 a.m., Wednesday, November 29 WHERE: 380 Highland Avenue, South Portland Part of a larger release program Wednesday?s scheduled release is part of a larger release program, undertaken in conjunction with the University of Massachusetts, with funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture?s Forest Service to control the winter moth across New England. Flies have been released in five other locations in south coastal Maine starting in 2013 and are starting to become established in Kittery and Cape Elizabeth. In many location in Massachusetts, where the flies have been released since 2005, the parasitoid numbers have increased to the point where they are having an impact on the winter moth population. Concurrently, the Maine Forest Service is again seeking public assistance in tracking where winter moth adult males are showing up in large numbers. This can be achieved using a simple on-line survey. The information will be used to better understand the locations and size of the winter moth population in Maine. Adults are active from late November to January whenever the temperature is above freezing and they are strongly attracted to light. Males are small, light brown to tan moths. They are attracted to lights and to a chemical released by the females. Adult females are small, gray and look like a mosquito wearing a fur coat. They have reduced wings and are flightless. Females are most commonly found crawling on the trunks of trees. Public Encouraged to help track winter moth The survey can be accessed online at: [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/wintermothsurvey.](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/wintermothsurvey.) Reports of moth flights can also be made by phone at (207) 287-2431. Winter moth (Operophtera brumata) & parasitic flies (Cyzenis albicans) Both the winter moth and their parasites are originally from Europe. Winter moth defoliation was first recorded in Maine in 2012 and now the moths have been detected from Kittery to Mount Desert Island. The larvae (caterpillars) of winter moth feed on the leaves deciduous trees and shrubs such as oaks, maples, apples and blueberries, in early spring. Heavy defoliation for several consecutive years leads to branch dieback and tree mortality. Winter moth defoliation has contributed to tens of thousands of acres of oak mortality in Massachusetts and now there is oak mortality in Cape Elizabeth. The parasitic flies only attack winter moth and the adult flies are around for just a few weeks in May making it a good biocontrol agent. They have been successfully used as a control strategy in Nova Scotia, parts of western Canada and the US as well in southern New England. Supporting documents Latest Round of Coastal Community Planning Grants Awarded December 12, 2017 For more information contact: Ruta Dzenis at: (207) 287-2851 The Department of Agriculture Conservation and Forestry (DACF) announces the award of nearly $167,000 through its Coastal Community Grant Program for six projects located throughout coastal Maine. This year?s grants, awarded and administered by DACF?s Municipal Planning Assistance Program, will support the coastal economy by providing planning assistance for projects that will prevent flood damage to municipal infrastructure, restore fisheries habitat, protect natural-resource-based tourism and increase the climate resiliency of coastal downtowns. The grants are made possible by the Maine Coastal Program, Department of Marine Resources (DMR), which provides funding through Maine?s federal coastal zone management award from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Each project involves regional or local-level partnerships and each grantee provides a minimum of 25% in matching funds or services. The Coastal Community Grants are an important element of the Municipal Planning Assistance Program?s mission to improve economic conditions by providing technical and financial assistance to Maine municipalities. This is the 8th round of Coastal Community Grants, which since 2012, have provided over $1.46 million for 62 projects throughout coastal Maine. More information on previously-funded projects can be found on the Municipal Planning Assistance Program's Financial Assistance page. This year, the following grants have been awarded: West Harbor Pond Water Quality Restoration Project Town of Boothbay Harbor ($12,400) The Town, working with the West Harbor Pond Watershed Association and other cooperating agencies and organizations will design a replacement for the siphon that, for over 120 years, protected the water quality of West Harbor Pond. With the siphon?s failure in 2008, salt water seeping through the dam and entering the pond at extreme high tide is no longer being removed, resulting significant adverse impact on aquatic life. With the replacement of the siphon, evacuation of the salt water will resume, the pond?s water quality will be restored, and the adverse impact on its valuable aquatic habitat will be reversed. Cape Elizabeth Culvert and Habitat Impact Assessment Town of Cape Elizabeth ($20,500) The Town will survey the condition of its 20 most significant culverts, and conduct at detailed assessment of three major Spurwink Marsh road crossings. The assessment will evaluate current conditions and the environmental impacts of several possible infrastructure changes designed to increase climate resiliency. The project will build on the Maine Coastal Program-funded 2015 Cape Elizabeth Sea Level Rise Vulnerability Assessment, prepared by the Greater Portland Council of Governments (GPCOG) with the assistance of Maine Geological Survey. Preparation for Coastal Flooding in Harpswell: A Plan for Basin Point Road and its Wetlands Town of Harpswell ($20,000) The Town, its consulting engineer, and the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership will develop a long-term plan for managing the potential impacts of coastal flooding due to sea level rise and storm surge on a portion of Basin Point Road. Options for managing the impact of increased salt water movement into a nearby pond and valuable wetlands will be developed, and the cost of measures to mitigate the impacts of coastal storms and flooding on the road, culverts and surrounding habitat will be addressed. This work will build on an earlier project conducted by Bowdoin College Environmental Studies students, the Maine Geological Survey and the Midcoast Council of Governments. York River Watershed Analysis Southern Maine Regional Planning Commission ($15,000) The Southern Maine Planning and Development Commission, in coordination with the York River Study Committee, will review existing municipal land-use ordinances within the York River watershed, conduct a watershed-wide build-out study, and recommend measures to protect various watershed resources. This work will contribute directly to the Study Committee?s development of a watershed management plan, which will be presented to each of the four towns in the watershed for possible local adoption. Trout Brook Culvert Improvements Project City of South Portland ($54,805) Over the past several years, the City has made considerable efforts to improve the water quality and aquatic habitat of Trout Brook. In 2012, these efforts included the development of the DEP-funded Trout Brook Watershed Management Plan. The City will now be able to begin implementation of a key recommendation of the plan: to enhance stream connectivity by improving or restoring fish passage at several culverts. This grant will fund a hydrologic and hydraulic study that will allow strategic culvert improvements to be made with assurance that no unintended flooding or erosion impacts will result. Machias Waterfront Resilience and Renewal Town of Machias ($45,094) The Town of Machias, working with the Washington County Council of Governments, will undertake three discrete yet related planning tasks: 1) a feasibility study which will identify conceptual designs and establish a plan to build flood protection along the existing seawall in downtown Machias; 2) an economic analysis of improving flood protection for downtown Machias; and 3) conceptual plans incorporating seawall improvements into the restoration of the historic wharf and river walk. Each task will explore ways to move downtown Machias towards greater climate resiliency, and taken together, provide a complementary approach to realizing a more sustainable and vibrant community.

They also include support for the creation of value-added vegetable products that can be marketed on a global scale. ?The investments being announced today support producers and processors of Maine wild blueberries; value-added vegetable products to compete in the global marketplace; and organic poultry processing in Washington County,? said Governor Paul R. LePage. ?Maine?s reputation for quality, locally-grown products, combined with the resourcefulness of the Maine people, will help agriculture realize its full economic potential.? Commissioner Walt Whitcomb highlighted Maine?s efforts to support farmers and producers through enhanced marketing, technical support and promotion of Maine agriculture locally, nationally and internationally. ?Selected projects address critical needs in the agricultural industry, Washington County in particular, for development of new markets and processing techniques for wild blueberries and organic poultry processing,? said Whitcomb. ?They also include support for the creation of value-added vegetable products that can be marketed on a global scale. We congratulate the grantees and look forward to successful implementation of their projects.? The selected projects were chosen by a review committee from thirty-five (35) qualified proposals submitted in response to a formal Request For Proposals (RFP). Of those proposals received and reviewed by a committee in a competitive review process, five (5) projects were selected. FY18 Agricultural Development Grants Blue Sky Produce (Scarborough) - $10,000 In order to help stimulate demand for frozen wild blueberries, Blue Sky Produce and 13 fresh-pack wild blueberry growers will conduct 40 educational demonstrations for fresh wild blueberries in retail stores in New York and New Jersey. LaJoie Growers, LLC (Van Buren) - $50,000 LaJoie Growers will expand vegetable and dehydrating processing capabilities to produce a value-added dehydrated beet product that can be marketed on a global scale. Tide Mill Organics (Edmunds Township) - $50,000 Tide Mill Organics will improve its organic poultry processing plant in Washington County to become a State-Inspected Processing Facility and to develop value-added products, such as ground turkey and chicken, poultry sausages, and pet food. University of Maine (Orono) - $27,735 Dr. Jennifer Perry of the School of Food and Agriculture will conduct research to optimize aqueous washing procedures for wild blueberries growers and processors to ensure improved food safety. Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine (Orono) - $50,000 The Wild Blueberry Commission will expand its marketing program to expand sales of frozen Wild Blueberries in the nation?s public schools. Agricultural Development Grant Program In 2014, the Legislature approved Department language that improved access to the Agricultural Development Fund. The Department identified the agricultural industry need for accelerating new market development, adoption of improved technology and promotion of agricultural products produced in Maine. The Commissioner of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry may allocate the grant funds among projects involving market research, market promotion, or a combination of those activities for the purpose of expanding existing markets and developing new markets for agricultural products produced in Maine; or for testing and demonstrating new technologies related to the production, storage or processing of State agricultural products. It is anticipated that another Agricultural Development Fund RFP will be released in the future.

Officials at the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) report that emerald ash borer (EAB) has been found in Maine. Despite an aggressive search for at least a decade, the destructive forest insect from Asia had not been detected in Maine previously. It has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees in thirty-four states throughout the country. The estimated commercial (unprocessed) value of Maine ash trees is approximately $320 million. United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials with the Animal and Plant Health and Inspection Service (APHIS) have confirmed the identification of a pre-pupa found in Madawaska, Maine. The discovery was made by a joint DACF ? U.S. Forest Service (USFS) team on May 22, 2018. The team had responded following the discovery of EAB in Edmundston, New Brunswick, just across the river from Madawaska. Discovery Anticipated The Maine DACF has long anticipated the arrival of EAB and the inevitable destruction that follows. Public outreach has been conducted for fifteen (15) years. Experts have long believed that the insect has been present Maine but undetected despite an aggressive effort to find it. Its discovery in Quebec, Vermont and New Hampshire further added to the growing concern. Steps Taken To Locate EAB (EAB Surveillance in Maine) - Firewood awareness (2003?present) - Exotic Woodboring/Bark Beetle Survey (2004?2007, 2015) - Girdled Trap Tree Surveys (2007?present) - Purple Trap Surveys (2008?present)?4,668 traps - Hundreds of participating volunteers, looking for visual signs of EAB, including woodpecker feeding - Cerceris Biosurveillance (2008?present) - Forest Pest Outreach Trainings (2009?present)?Outreach, events, presentations - Nursery Visual Surveys (2015?present)?More than 30 nurseries - Green Funnel Trap (2016?present) - Conservation District outreach and trainings (2016?present) Current Maine Response Status State and federal officials are meeting to implement a statewide emergency-response plan. To determine the extent of the infestation, a multi-agency survey effort has been launched including personnel from the Maine DACF, APHIS and USFS. As recently as April 26, officials conducted a multi-agency tabletop meeting to create an emergency plan for responding to EAB?s eventual discovery and implement a planned response. That is now underway. Additional information will be released as more is learned from teams in the field and as data is processed. Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) Emerald ash borer was first discovered in the Detroit, Michigan area in 2002, though it is believed to have arrived in the 1990s. The beetle is about one half an inch and metallic green. Its larva tunnels through the wood just under the bark of ash trees and can kill even healthy trees in three-to-five years. Hundreds of millions of trees across the country have been killed. Ash trees comprise 4 percent of Maine?s hardwood forest and are also an important street tree. Emerald ash borer threatens all species of ash trees (except mountain ash) and could have significant ecological and economic impacts. There are no practical means to control EAB in forested areas, though pesticide treatments can protect individual trees. Slowing the spread of EAB is crucial. An emerald ash borer generally moves only about one half-mile on its own in a year, but can move hundreds of miles in a single day within a piece of infested firewood. Caution Regarding Firewood Emerald ash borer is not the only threat to our forests that can move in the seemingly benign firewood brought to camp. Numerous other insects and diseases can also hitchhike in firewood. Spread the word: use local firewood. If you have friends or family planning to visit Maine, make sure they are aware of the state and federal rules that ban movement of untreated firewood (www.maine.gov/firewood). Sources of treated or local firewood can be found online at firewood scout [http://firewoodscout.org/s/ME/.](http://firewoodscout.org/s/ME/.)

The purpose of the public meeting is to provide information about the department's planned response to the detection of emerald ash borer; discuss the bureau's proposed emergency order to stop movement of ash from Frenchville and Madawaska; and receive feedback and input from the public. WHEN: Monday, June 18, starting at 6:30 p.m. WHERE: The Frenchville Community Center [https://www.frenchville.org/services/community-center.html](https://www.frenchville.org/services/community-center.html) WHAT: Members of the public in the affected area are encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions prior to adoption of a Proposed Stop Movement Order for Frenchville and Madawaska. FUTURE MEETINGS: Will cover the biology of the insect, implications for forest health and management and potential impacts to cities and towns. Discovery of EAB will change how ash is allowed to move The emerald ash borer (EAB) was recently discovered in Madawaska, less than 200 yards from the Frenchville town line. This is the first detection of EAB in Maine. Because EAB attacks and kills all species of ash (except mountain ash), it presents a serious threat to Maine's forest and shade trees. It is also a federally and internationally quarantined pest, which further adds priority to Maine's response. As a first step the MFS is proposing to place a temporary, emergency \"stop movement\"? order on all live ash, ash logs and pulpwood and on all untreated firewood from Madawaska and Frenchville, Aroostook County. This emergency order is a temporary, stop-gap measure to address the immediate threat of inadvertent movement of EAB while the DACF and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) negotiate the size and conditions of a formal state/federal quarantine.

Supporting documents Warning: browntail moth cocoons are full of the caterpillars' toxic hairs! June 21, 2018 For more information contact: Forest Health and Monitoring at: (207) 827-1813 Browntail moth--an invasive species whose caterpillars have toxic, irritating hairs-is found at varying population densities over more than 6500 square miles of Maine ( [see map](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/browntail_moth_info.htm)). It is a pest that has hunkered down in the Midcoast and Casco Bay area for years, and has recently expanded its footprint. People looking to reduce browntail moth populations may look at the cocoons as an opportunity for reduction. However, you will have limited impact through cleaning cocoons. Safer, more effective control will be had through targeting larvae, either in overwintering webs (put a reminder in your calendar now to look for those structures at the tips of host branches around your property this fall and winter!) or as they feed on host leaves in early spring. You may still want to remove the cocoons to limit potential for exposure to the toxic hairs they contain. However, do this with extreme caution. Cocoons are full of the hairs THAT CAN CAUSE A RASH or worse. If you plan to remove cocoons: - Wear protective clothing (in addition to long sleeves, pants, socks, socks, shoes, gloves, mask and glasses, consider protective coveralls) - Wet down cocoons before removing them - Scrape cocoons and drop them in soapy water, let them soak overnight then dispose of them Even if you don't plan to remove cocoons, become familiar with their appearance, and learn to avoid them or wear appropriate protective clothing during your outdoor activities that might bring you in contact with them. Browntail moth caterpillars wander and form their cocoons anywhere. Favorite places include: Under the eaves of buildings or the undersides of anything (reports include vehicles, and even a baby stroller) and wrapped in the leaves of any plant. Traveling within the cocoons on vehicles, outdoor equipment and other items (including firewood), is a very efficient means of spread for this moth. If you have plans to travel between the affected and unaffected areas over the next month, check your belongings closely for these cocoons. This winter, be on the lookout for the tell-tale webs in new places. These are the places where control will be most effective!

EMERGENCY ORDER ISSUED - Restricting the Movement of Certain Ash (Fraxinus spp) Products and Any Untreated Firewood from Emerald Ash Borer Infested Towns in Maine August 10, 2018 For more information contact: Allison Kanoti, Gary Fish at: (207) 827-1813, (207) 287-7545 AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's (DACF) Bureau of Forestry Director has issued an Emergency Order to Stop Movement of Ash in response to the detection of emerald ash borer (EAB) in northern Aroostook County. The Emergency Order restricts the movement of certain ash (Fraxinus spp.) products and any untreated firewood from emerald ash borer (EAB) infested towns in Maine. Current Order Area Towns: Frenchville, Grand Isle and Madawaska, Aroostook County, Maine. To protect the ash resources of the state of Maine from the unrestricted spread and establishment of a dangerous tree-killing forest pest, the Director of the Maine Bureau of Forestry has taken action and issued the Order pursuant to authority granted by 12 M.R.S. \u00a7 8305. The full text of the order is available on the Department's EAB information page: www.maine.gov/eab. BACKGROUND The emerald ash borer is a highly destructive, introduced pest of forest and ornamental ash trees (Fraxinus spp.). Since its initial detection in southeastern Michigan near Detroit in the summer of 2002 it has spread rapidly. As of August 2018, it has been found in 35 states, and 4 Canadian provinces. Ash trees infested with EAB may die within two to three years. From 2002 to 2018, EAB has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees in infested states and provinces, and has cost municipalities, property owners, nursery operators and forest products industries hundreds of millions of dollars. In response to the significant ecological and economic threat posed by EAB, Canada and the state of Michigan established EAB quarantines in 2002. In 2003, the United States Department of Agriculture - Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) established a federal quarantine to restrict movement of potentially infested material. Federally regulated materials include: The emerald ash borer; firewood of all hardwood (non-coniferous) species; nursery stock, green lumber, and other material living, dead, cut, or fallen, including logs, stumps, roots, branches, and composted and uncomposted chips of the genus Fraxinus. Unless infested states restrict internal movement of potentially infested ash material, the federal government will designate the entire state as a quarantined area, which designation will subject the state to federal regulations restricting interstate and international commerce of ash material. In late May 2018, an established EAB infestation was detected in Edmundston, New Brunswick, Canada, approximately 500 yards from the Maine border ( [www.maine.gov/eab](http://www.maine.gov/eab)). Subsequent multi-agency surveys detected lightly-infested ash trees in Maine immediately across the river from the Edmundston infestation. The infested ash trees were located in Madawaska, immediately adjacent to the Frenchville town line. In early-August purple trap surveys revealed that EAB is also established in the town of Grand Isle. The detected infestation in Maine is very light and covers only a small area. If immediate steps are not taken to contain the infestation, however, this infestation will spread. Following the initial detection, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF), Bureau of Forestry, also known as the Maine Forest Service (MFS), reached out to all contacts on active commercial timber harvest operations, firewood dealers, and nursery and plant sellers within Madawaska and Frenchville and apprised them of the situation. The DACF also notified local municipal officials and legislators. The DACF held a meeting in Frenchville to discuss the implications of the situation with local residents and businesses. At this meeting, and in subsequent correspondence and media coverage, the DACF informed residents that a stop movement order was planned for early August after the MFS conducted additional delimitation surveys and sought additional comments. Ash trees comprise 4 percent of Maine's hardwood forest, are a valuable timber species, and are also an important street tree. EAB threatens all species of ash trees (except mountain ash) and could have significant ecological and economic impacts on the state. There are no practical means to control EAB in forested areas, though pesticide treatments can protect individual trees. To assist wood processors in complying with the order requirements, the MFS will provide a list through e-mail distribution of active forest operations within the order area. Requests to be added to this list should be directed to [forestinfo@maine.gov](mailto:forestinfo@maine.gov) An informational meeting on Emerald Ash Borer is planned in northern Aroostook County for August 23, 2018 @ 6:30 pm, location TBD.

WHEN: Thursday, August 23, starting at 6:30 p.m. WHERE: The Frenchville Community Center [https://www.frenchville.org/services/community-center.html](https://www.frenchville.org/services/community-center.html) WHAT: Members of the public and the media are encouraged to attend and learn more about the emerald ash borer and impacts of its arrival in Maine. BACKGROUND The EAB is a highly destructive, introduced pest of forest and ornamental ash trees (Fraxinus spp.). Since its initial detection in southeastern Michigan near Detroit in the summer of 2002 it has spread rapidly. As of August 2018, it has been found in 35 states, and four Canadian provinces. Ash trees infested with EAB may die within two to three years. From 2002 to 2018, EAB has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees in infested states and provinces, and has cost municipalities, property owners, nursery operators and forest products industries hundreds of millions of dollars. In late May 2018, an established EAB infestation was detected in Edmundston, New Brunswick, Canada. Subsequent surveys in Maine detected lightly-infested ash trees in Madawaska adjacent to the Frenchville town line. In early August EAB was found on purple traps in the town of Grand Isle, ME. The MFS implemented a stop movement order on ash from the towns of Frenchville, Grand Isle and Madawaska on August 10th, 2018. Ash trees comprise four percent of Maine's hardwood forest, are a valuable timber species, and are also an important street tree. EAB threatens all species of ash trees (but not mountain-ash) and could have significant ecological and economic impacts on the state. There are no practical means to control EAB in forested areas, though pesticide treatments can protect individual trees.

About 300 flowering stems were found in a damp field on privately held land in Bowdoin. This showy plant has not been seen in Maine in over 130 years and was thought to be extirpated. It is known from only three herbarium specimens, two of which were collected by Maine botanist Kate Furbish (Wells in 1879, Brunswick in 1874), and the third from near Lewiston in 1887. Unicorn Root, also known as White Colic-root or Colicroot, ranges across most of the eastern United States and Ontario, though it is rare in most of the northeastern states and in Ontario. It grows in open, moist, sandy ground and is typically associated with tallgrass prairie habitats and damp, sandy meadows with little to no topsoil. Unicorn Root has a basal rosette of lance-shaped leaves, and a single, tall flowering stalk with white flowers that appear in June through August. The scientific name (Aletris farinosa) is in reference to the unusual rough, grainy texture of the flowers. The species name (farinosa) means 'floury', and the genus name (Aletris) comes from the Greek word for grinding grain (the Aletris was the servant who ground the grain).

These funds will provide $50 worth of fresh fruits and vegetables to an additional 1,000 Maine seniors for the duration of this growing season. ELIGIBILITY: The program is for Maine seniors who are 60 and older and meet income eligibility guidelines. DEADLINE: Seniors must sign up with a farm by September 21, 2018. (Note: Some farms will show as full, seniors should still contact them due to the additional funds, all farms should have availability) Maine Senior FarmShare: Maine's Senior Farmers' Market Nutrition Program, Maine Senior FarmShare, is managed by the Maine Department of Agriculture and supported by partner agencies throughout Maine. It utilizes a community-supported agriculture model to maximize benefits to local produce farmers and low-income seniors. During the 2017 season, participating farmers provided fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs directly to approximately 17,000 low-income seniors throughout Maine. Maine's program provides individual Maine seniors with $50 worth of fresh fruits and vegetables during the growing season. The program is designed to maximize direct support to farmers and low-income seniors, promote community relationships and provide nutrition education. A \"share\" is $50 worth of fruits and vegetables delivered directly to seniors. Farmers may also have seniors come to their farm, a farmers' market or other distribution sites where seniors can select what they want and \"draw down\" on their credit balance. Available fruits and vegetables vary from farm to farm, for September through November they may include: squash, corn, apples, beets, broccoli, eggplant, radishes, pumpkins and potatoes.

This alarming new development follows a spring discovery in northern Aroostook County. The emerald ash borer (EAB) is a highly destructive, introduced pest of forest and ornamental ash trees (Fraxinus spp.). Since its initial detection in southeastern Michigan near Detroit in the summer of 2002 it has spread rapidly. As of August 2018, it has been found in 35 states, and four Canadian provinces including Maine. Earlier this week, EAB adults were recovered on two purple traps in York County, Maine. One adult beetle was found in both Acton and Lebanon by the USDA-APHIS contractor, Delta 21. Field personnel from the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, Maine Forest Service are currently conducting ground surveys in the area to follow up on the trap detections. In late May 2018, an established EAB infestation was detected in Edmundston, New Brunswick, Canada. Subsequent surveys in Maine detected lightly-infested ash trees in Madawaska adjacent to the Frenchville town line. In early August EAB was found on purple traps in the town of Grand Isle, ME. The MFS implemented a stop movement order on ash from the towns of Frenchville, Grand Isle and Madawaska on August 10th, 2018. This order will be amended to include affected towns in York County once the initial follow up survey is conducted. Ash trees infested with EAB may die within two to three years. Since its arrival in North America, EAB has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees in infested states and provinces, and has cost municipalities, property owners, nursery operators and forest products industries hundreds of millions of dollars. Ash trees comprise four percent of Maine's hardwood forest, are a valuable timber species, and are also an important street tree. EAB threatens all species of ash trees (but not mountain-ash, Sorbus spp.) and will have significant ecological and economic impacts on the state. There are no practical means to control EAB in forested areas, though pesticide treatments can protect individual trees. A public meeting will be held in York County in the near future, details to be announced shortly.

The Emergency Order restricts the movement of certain ash (Fraxinus spp.) products and any untreated firewood from EAB infested towns in Maine. Current Order Area Towns: AROOSTOOK COUNTY towns of Frenchville, Grand Isle and Madawaska YORK COUNTY towns of Acton, Berwick, Lebanon and Shapleigh To protect the ash resources of the State of Maine from the unrestricted spread and establishment of a dangerous tree-killing forest pest, the Director of the Maine Bureau of Forestry has taken action and issued the Order pursuant to authority granted by 12 M.R.S. 8305. For more information about EAB, or to view the full text of the order, visit the Department's EAB information page: www.maine.gov/eab. BACKGROUND The emerald ash borer is a highly destructive, introduced pest of forest and ornamental ash trees (Fraxinus spp.). Since its initial detection in southeastern Michigan near Detroit in the summer of 2002 it has spread rapidly. As of September 2018, it has been found in 35 states, and 4 Canadian provinces. Ash trees infested with EAB may die within two to three years. From 2002 to 2018, EAB has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees in infested states and provinces, and has cost municipalities, property owners, nursery operators and forest products industries hundreds of millions of dollars. In response to the significant ecological and economic threat posed by EAB, Canada and the state of Michigan established EAB quarantines in 2002. In 2003, the United States Department of Agriculture\u2014Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) established a federal quarantine to restrict movement of potentially infested material. Federally regulated materials include the emerald ash borer; firewood of all hardwood (non-coniferous) species; nursery stock, green lumber, and other material living, dead, cut, or fallen, including logs, stumps, roots, branches, and composted and uncomposted chips of the genus Fraxinus. Unless infested states restrict internal movement of potentially infested ash material, the federal government will designate the entire state as a quarantined area, which designation will subject the state to federal regulations restricting interstate and international commerce of ash material. In late May 2018, an established EAB infestation was detected in Edmundston, New Brunswick, Canada, approximately 500 yards from the Maine border (www.maine.gov/eab). Subsequent multi-agency surveys detected lightly-infested ash trees in Maine immediately across the river from the Edmundston infestation near the Frenchville/Madawaska town line. In early-August purple trap surveys revealed that EAB is also established in the town of Grand Isle. Most recently adult emerald ash borers were recovered from traps in Acton and Lebanon, York County, Maine close to the towns of Berwick and Shapleigh. Ash trees comprise 4 percent of Maine's hardwood forest, are a valuable timber species, and are also an important street tree. EAB threatens all species of ash trees (except mountain ash) and could have significant ecological and economic impacts on the state. There are no practical means to control EAB in forested areas, though pesticide treatments can protect individual trees. To date, emerald ash borers have been found in a fraction of a percent of the ash resource in Maine. The detection of emerald ash borer in York County will impact individual landowners, communities, and wood industry in a variety of ways. For example, moving firewood from the order area is prohibited; woodlot owners, foresters, and loggers involved in ash harvests will see a change in markets and the loss of a valuable timber species; rapid ash tree decline may threaten infrastructure and public safety. Informational Meeting in Lebanon October 1 Officials from the DACF Maine Forest Service (MFS) and Division of Animal and Plant Health, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, and USDA Forest Service will hold an information session in Lebanon, ME on Monday, October 1st, 2018 starting at 6:30 pm, at the Lebanon Elementary School, 65 Upper Guinea Rd, Lebanon, ME. The purpose of the public meeting is to provide background information on the insect; an update on the response to the detection of emerald ash borer; and discuss impacts on movement of wood products. Although the beetles were found on traps near the western border of York County and the order expansion only affects four towns, due to the size of the county it is likely that all of York County will be included in future state and federal quarantines.

Maine State Parks set all-time camping record! October 10, 2018 For more information contact: John Bott at: (207) 287-3156, john.c.bott@maine.gov Attendance records have been broken 8 times since 2010 AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Bureau of Parks and Lands announced that a record number of visitors camped in Maine State Parks in 2018. Through September, 255,553 campers have been recorded, breaking the previous all-time camping record of 254,789 set in 2016. A final camping total will not be complete until after December 31. Since 2010, attendance records (Day-Use, Camping and Total Attendance) have been broken and re-broken eight (8) times amidst a surge in State Park popularity. Total 2018 Maine State Park attendance through September is 11 percent higher than the same period last year, due to favorable weather, increased publicity and Governor Paul R. LePage's Resident Fee Holiday (August 11-September 3). \"Maine State Parks' attendance continues to grow at a record pace and just set the all-time camping record,\" said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. \"This is a healthy trend for Maine and the people and families who are enjoying the Maine outdoors. The growing success and popularity of year-round Maine State Park offerings and programs, favorable weather conditions, and our efforts to generate greater public awareness about Maine's outdoor recreational opportunities are all contributing factors.\" New report documents nearly $21 million annual economic benefit from modern wood heating of commercial and institutional buildings in Maine October 23, 2018 For more information contact: Charlie Niebling, John Bott at: (603) 965 5434, (207) 287-3156 Over 100 Maine campuses and larger buildings now heated with wood chips and pellets Augusta ME - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Maine Forest Service today released a report documenting the economic and environmental benefits of heating community, commercial and institutional buildings with modern wood chip and wood pellet technology and fuels produced in Maine. The Maine Forest Service analyzed the use of wood fuels in calendar year 2017 in hospitals, campuses, schools, municipal buildings and private businesses across the state. In the last 10 years, over 100 new installations have been made, nearly always replacing imported heating oil. Key findings of the analysis include: Savings in annual heating costs (versus average heating oil cost) - $5.5 million Direct spending on local fuels (wood pellets and wood chips instead of exporting fuel dollars for oil) - $6.3 million Total value of economic impact generated - $20.6 million \"It's clear that advanced wood heating technology is generating significant benefits for Maine, said Doug Denico, director of the Maine Forest Service. \"Modern, clean wood chip and pellet boilers are now heating a wide array of bigger buildings in our state. By switching to wood fuels, we keep our fuel dollars here, support our local economy and improve our forest resource base by strengthening markets for low grade wood.\" The study documented wood fuel use in these buildings at 19,000 tons of pellets and 45,000 tons of wood chips during 2017. These fuels are nearly entirely produced within Maine, supporting hundreds of jobs. The study did not evaluate residential use of wood and wood pellets, which has also grown dramatically in Maine. It also did not document industrial use of wood as a heating fuel, such as in wood manufacturing industries. These sectors have also grown significantly in the last decade and make substantial contributions to the state's economy by displacing the need for imported oil, propane or natural gas. \"Maine remains among the most dependent states in the country on imported fossil heating fuels,\" said Charlie Niebling, a consultant with Innovative Natural Resource Solutions and author of the study. \"We can sustainably displace a meaningful percentage of this with modern wood heating fuels from Maine forests. This transition can create jobs and economic opportunity at a time when other low-grade forest product markets are declining, and support good forest management.\" The Maine Forest Service, Maine Statewide Wood Energy Assistance Team maintains an interactive map feature where people can learn more about modern wood heating installations all over the state. The map feature can be accessed [here](http://www.woodheatmaine.org/). On October 25, the 1st Maine Modern Wood Heat Symposium will be held at Northern Maine Community College in Presque Isle. The public is welcome to attend. More information can be found at [www.woodheatmaine.org](http://www.woodheatmaine.org). All data and assumptions of the analysis are available upon request by contacting Charlie Niebling, at (603) 965-5434.

The Agricultural Resource Development division of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry (DACF) administers the program, with nine new projects selected for 2018. This annual program is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and supports producers with projects designed to improve competitiveness, technology, or product safety. Since 2006, the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program has awarded over $5.2 million dollars to the Maine DACF to support the growing number of specialty crop producers who are selling into local and regional markets. Each year, the Maine DACF accepts applications for Specialty Crop Block Grants, evaluating proposals in a competitive, statewide process. The program provides federal funding to projects identified as critical at the local level. Past and current awards have supported research into Maine's most crucial agricultural commodities, development of pest management strategies, school initiatives, and food safety projects. Funds have been used to improve harvests of blueberries, potatoes, maple syrup, hops, honey, and other crops. \"These investments strengthen many of Maine's most important agricultural crops, defined by the federal government as specialty crops,\" said Commissioner Walt Whitcomb. \"Selected projects benefit farmers and consumers by helping growers make food safety enhancements, solve research needs for better pest management, provide hands-on agricultural education for school children and make informed decisions that will increase the profitability and sustainability of Maine agriculture. These investments strengthen markets for Maine crops and help develop new economic opportunities.\" Among this year's awards are two for research at the University of Maine to improve blueberry production. According to Nancy McBrady, Executive Director of the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine, \"Specialty Crop Block Grants are particularly significant to the Maine wild blueberry industry. These block grants, funded by the federal Farm Bill, enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops in each state. The grants recently awarded to the University of Maine help propel critical wild blueberry research regarding Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and plant management. Further, the grants require education and training components which directly benefit wild blueberry growers in Maine.\" University researchers also won awards to improve the yield and quality of the potato crop and reduce pests. Food safety Vassalboro-based AgMatters LLC is a family run crop consulting business that has successfully applied for several Specialty Crop Block Grants over the last decade. According to AgMatters' Linda Titus, \"Specialty Crop Grants have allowed us to support and guide fruit and vegetable growers in Maine with their food safety needs. This has enabled growers to competitively sell their crops in larger markets and be prepared for the Food Safety & Modernization Act's Produce Safety Rule. The grants have provided Maine growers the opportunity to prepare for and to meet the challenges of these new laws by educating and informing them of exactly what they need to know and do before the law is enforced.\" This year's recipients: University of Maine ($70,539.00) - Developing Sulfur Recommendations for Maine potato growers The University of Maine Cooperative Extension will develop sulfur recommendation for Maine potato growers to improve Maine potato yield and quality. Objectives of this study are to create robust sulfur recommendations, with multiple sites that will include varied soil textures, soil moisture, and weather conditions. Yield, quality, soil moisture, weather data, uptake, tissue sampling, and soil physical, chemical, and biological data will be used for this study. Maine Potato Board ($100,000) - Maine potato cropping system lack diversity to remain financially and environmentally sustainable. Over the past 3 years the Maine Potato Board (MPB) has taken a lead role in promoting and researching alternative cash crops and cover crops that can be successfully grown in conjunction with potatoes. Improving soil health and conservation and producing alternative cash crops continue to be high priorities for potato producers throughout Maine. Growers who have adopted longer potato rotations are realizing the environmental and economic benefits that accompany these diverse cropping systems. University of Maine ($99,571) - Maine Potato Integrated Pest Management - 2019 The management of insects, diseases, and other pests is integral to sustaining the $500 million Maine potato industry. Without reliable and sustainable pest management strategies, potato growers face the potential for severe crop losses resulting in significant reductions in profits and threats to long-term viability. To ensure an adequate response to the pest-related hazards confronting potato growers, the University of Maine System, acting through the University of Maine Cooperative Extension Potato Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program, will provide support through field monitoring, disease forecasting, and distribution of educational materials. University of Maine ($43,887) - Effects of Phenology and Fertilizer Applications on Wild Blueberry Production and Pests The Wild Blueberry Commission (WBC) is proposing a University of Maine project to study the Effects of Phenology and Fertilizer Applications on Wild Blueberry Production and Pests. Many of the new fertilizers on the market used by wild blueberry growers have not been evaluated for their impacts on weed and disease pressure. This project will evaluate the response of the wild blueberry system to these new products. Further, increased climate variability has already altered crop growth and pest pressure, requiring research on timing and techniques for revised fertilizer applications. University of Maine ($99,880) - Improving blueberry production with IPM for weeds and diseases The Wild Blueberry Commission (WBC) will work with the University of Maine project to develop and implement a weed and disease Integrated Pest Management program that takes cost and efficiency into account. There are 510 wild blueberry growers in Maine managing 44,000 commercial acres. This project would prevent $32.6 million in annual grower losses and sustain $128 million in value added economic activity per year to Maine. Over the past several years wild blueberry growers have consistently ranked controlling weeds and diseases as two of their top concerns for sustaining crop production and yield. Maine Landscape & Nursery Association ($52,070) - Plant something at school. Outreach program to Maine's PK - 12 students in support of Maine's Nursery and Landscape Specialty Crop Industry The Maine School Garden Collaborative (MSGC), a group of four partners, consists of Maine Agriculture in the Classroom (MAITC), ReTreeUS, Maine School Garden Network (MSGN) and MELNA. This program has developed as an offshoot of MELNA's successful Plant Something! Plant ME! (PSPM!) marketing effort supported by SCBGP in the last three years. This coordinated outreach will include new resources for school gardens, newly planted school orchards, and the publishing of a new children's book in the \"Agriculture for ME\" series promoted with the \"Plant Something at School!\" marketing vehicle. AgMatters, LLC $42,963 - Keeping up with the produce safety rule AgMatters LLC will offer all Maine specialty crop growers opportunities to be made aware of the Produce Safety Rule of FSMA and guiding information as they take steps to implement it. AgMatters LLC will update growers as the law evolves, offer guidance to growers of options they may have, and serve as an information funnel for those looking for solutions to issues they may need to resolve to be compliant. AgMatters, LLC $29,163 - Food Safety Planning AgMatters LLC's \"Food Safety Planning\" will provide growers the training and understanding needed to streamline recordkeeping processes that will meet GAP standards as well as the Produce Safety Rule. \"Food Safety Planning\" is for all farms in Maine to help them to determine what they need to log and keep track. It will also guide growers to examine these records that they are mandated to keep and glean information from them that may inform their business decision making. Specialty Crop Block Grant Applications: The Specialty Crop Block Grant application period is typically in the spring. (Review this year's projects and sign up to receive announcements online: [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/grants/usdaspecialtycrop.shtml)](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/grants/usda_specialty_crop.shtml)) Organizations of various sizes are eligible to apply for the grants, provided their projects serve multiple producers. The USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service oversees the program, and emphasizes the importance of partnerships. The Maine DACF has been fortunate to partner successfully with the USDA to offer these grants for a dozen years. The success is also due to the dedication and collaboration of grant recipients. Maine becomes only New England State with Cooperative Interstate Shipment (CIS) Program November 19, 2018 For more information contact: John Bott at: 207-287-3156 Select Maine slaughterhouses & processors to wholesale products nationwide AUGUSTA-The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry announced today that Maine has signed a new Cooperative Interstate Shipment (CIS) program agreement with U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) which will allow selected Maine slaughterhouses and processors to wholesale their products in every state and in the District of Columbia. Plant applications will be accepted beginning December 1, 2018. Until the CIS agreement was signed, Maine slaughterhouses and processors could only slaughter and process animals for wholesale and/or retail sales within the state of Maine. Maine is only the fifth state to receive one of these CIS agreements, and the only state in New England or on the East Coast to have been offered one by USDA-FSIS. \"The new Cooperative Interstate Shipment (CIS) agreement will open new markets for meat and poultry establishments and Maine producers,\" said Governor Paul R. LePage. \"It will provide access to new markets to sell our products beyond Maine borders and to local businesses with out of state locations (i.e. Hannaford, Shaw's, Walmart etc.). The CIS will also potentially double the number of local options for livestock producers who want to be able to harvest and process their animals within Maine but sell their products out of state.\" CIS is important because: - Maine livestock producers who utilize State inspected plants were previously limited to in-state sales, but will be able to sell out of state and online if their plant joins the program - Maine slaughterhouses and processors currently serve hundreds of livestock producers whose markets will open up nationwide if their slaughterhouse joins the program - Livestock producers and slaughterhouses will now be able to sell their product to grocery stores with out of state locations (Hannaford, Walmart etc.)-they were previously limited to stores that only operate within Maine before CIS - Maine livestock producers who currently must utilize USDA plants because they have established accounts out of state could now go to potentially more conveniently located state plants - the only slaughterhouse in Sagadahoc County, for example, is a State of Maine inspected plant. - CIS complements the food \"locavore\" movement, the effort to feature food that is grown, raised and produced locally by giving Maine livestock and poultry producers more local options - An organic poultry establishment starting under State inspection in January is already planning on joining the CIS program, which will not only make it the only organic poultry processor in the state of Maine but one of the few that can sell organically processed poultry in the Northeast. - Livestock producers in neighboring states can take their animals to selected Maine slaughterhouses and processors if they choose, because the product can be sold back home in their own state - Livestock producers and Maine slaughterhouses could now potentially service contracts that require Federally inspected meat and poultry, because all meat from a CIS slaughterhouse will have both a State and Federal mark of inspection on it. - States with CIS programs and their selected establishments are also be eligible to expand into exports, which would allow sales of Maine processed meat and poultry to Canada and beyond.

They provide quality foods, thousands of jobs and millions of dollars in farm receipts, not including direct sales at farms or farmers markets, or the economic impact of businesses who support farms. This event is a place to network and plan for the future of Maine agriculture,\" says show organizer, Anne Trenholm. Something for Everyone: There are 110 exhibits featuring agricultural products, equipment and services. One of the state's largest agricultural exhibitions, the annual event is expected to draw nearly 3,000 attendees over the course of three days. \"There are nearly 120 scheduled workshops, presentations and meetings. Approximately one-third of those activities provide continuing education certifications for farmers and people who work in agriculture. Of the hundred-plus meetings, approximately 15 are annual meetings of agricultural organizations, and all of them focus on growing Maine agriculture,\" says Trenholm. This year's show features several new offerings for attendees in addition to a wide variety of presentations covering diverse topics of interest. New 2019 program highlights include the resource room, a place for producers to meet Bureau of Agriculture staff to learn about programs and resources. There will be a live broadcast of MPBN's Maine Calling at the show on Tuesday, January 15, and the demonstration stage schedule features resources to help attendees navigate the show, and learn techniques to select, prepare and enjoy Maine ingredients all year long. This three-day event has something for everyone, the farmer, non-farmer, hobbyist, educator, supplier or food enthusiast. Attendees can walk through, observe and learn about how food is harvested and processed. Food and farm product enthusiasts can discover Maine food recipes at the demonstration stage, and shop for Maine farm-produced foods and goods. Farmers and producers can see the most up-to-date farm equipment and processing methods and equipment, and learn latest developments in Maine agriculture.

Funded by the USDA Forest Service, Project Canopy grants are available in two categories: planning and education grants and tree planting and maintenance grants. Typical grants range from $6,000 to $8,000 and require a 50-percent cost-share with cash or in-kind services. Since 2005, Project Canopy has awarded more than $1.5 million in funding for community forestry projects. Project Canopy is a program of the Maine Forest Service under the Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry. It encourages communities to develop project proposals that support sustainable community forestry management, increase awareness of the benefits of trees and forests, and increase the health and livability of communities through sound tree planting and maintenance. Project Canopy Director Jan Ames Santerre provided recent examples of community projects that can benefit from Project Canopy grants. Projects of note in 2018 include Garland ($4,345), Bethel ($10,000), and Bridgton ($10,000) for management planning for forests and Dexter ($4,155), Waterville ($7,150), and Kennebunk ($8,000) that allowed those towns to plant trees in downtowns and town parks. \"In addition to helping communities with general maintenance planning, these grants allow towns to respond to threats from invasive pests such as the emerald ash borer. They can also support community beautification through street tree planting,\" said Santerre. Planning and education grants have a maximum award of $10,000, while planting and maintenance grants have a maximum award of $8,000. To be eligible to apply for a 2019 assistance grant, all applicants must attend a grant workshop before submitting an application. The grant workshop will be held on February 12, 2019 via the web.

Emergency Food Program Operating Despite Federal Government Shutdown January 25, 2019 For more information contact: Leigh Hallett at: (207) 215-7388 The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry (DACF) announced today that its food programs have a steady supply of food to distribute to food pantries and other non-profit organizations throughout the state. The Department operates The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), which provides a wide variety of nutritious, high-quality foods to partnering organizations throughout the state. Both TEFAP and a related program, the Commodities Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) are based in Augusta and serve all 16 counties. Through these programs, Maine can procure large quantities of nutritious foods from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Although the USDA has been affected by the federal government shutdown, the DACF's TEFAP/CSFP Director Jason Hall says, \"There's no need for the staff and volunteers who run these organizations to be concerned about the flow of USDA food that we are sending to them. We place our orders months in advance, and the contracts are in place to supply this food for at least 6 months.\" \"We want to assure the food pantries, and their patrons, that the USDA food is going to keep coming,\" says Hall. \"All those staple foods that pantries rely on, such as canned vegetables, pasta, cereals, peanut butter, and even frozen meats, are already in the pipeline and headed for Maine.\" Hall orders food from the USDA weekly, planning months ahead to provide nutritionally sound menus, while strategically using his federal food aid budget to purchase the maximum amount of healthful foods. Leigh Hallett, Director of the DACF Agricultural Resource Development Division, says, \"We have consistently increased the amount of food purchases annually by shopping strategically and building solid relationships with the USDA staff. The amount of food we're supplying to pantries has increased dramatically in recent years, while the cost to operate the programs has remained consistent.\" In 2018, the Maine DACF provided 252 organizations with the healthy staple foods that form the basis of a nutritious diet for vulnerable families. The Department's Augusta facility distributed more than 1.2 million pounds of food statewide, as well as contracting with the Good Shepherd Food Bank for an additional 1.5 million pounds of food for distribution statewide. In 2018, an estimated 144,000 Mainers were living below the poverty line, and TEFAP provided food assistance to approximately 32,000 to 40,000 people each month. CSFP provided food boxes to 9,229 low income seniors monthly. Maine's network of food pantries relies on a variety of partners to provide other services, including cooking and nutrition classes. Maine SNAP-Ed, whose Nutrition Educators teach cooking skills to people of all ages, is one such program. The nutritionists often work with the staple foods provided by the TEFAP program, and help educate consumers about the less common foods as well. \"We know that the pantries receive large quantities of dried and canned beans through the DACF program, and our educators are teaching people simple recipes to utilize these foods that many Mainers are unfamiliar with. These staple foods will help many people across the state to prepare simple, healthy meals that will help them to stretch their limited food dollars,\" according to Maine SNAP-Ed Program Manager, Elizabeth Pratt.

The site is not a complete list of the projects protected over the last 30 years. Working farms have been omitted as have some working waterfront sites. Future efforts may include reaching out to working farms protected with an LMF-funded easement to determine their interest in being added to the site. Additional projects will be added to the site as they become available. The new map is designed to inform people about the LMF program and its role in protecting Maine's recreational and natural areas. The program was reviewed by the Legislature in 2015 as part of the Government Evaluation Act. This evaluation included a recommendation to improve public awareness and use of lands acquired with LMF funds. Details of the report are at [https://www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf/docs/2015GEAreport.pdf.](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf/docs/2015GEAreport.pdf.) The Land for Maine's Future Program is the State of Maine's primary funding vehicle for conserving land for its natural and recreational value. The program was established in 1987 when Maine citizens voted to fund $35 million to purchase lands of statewide importance. Over the past 30 years, the Land for Maine's Future Program has assisted in the protection of 54 water access sites, 40 farms totaling more than 9,700 acres, 24 commercial working waterfront properties, more than 1,200 miles of shore lands, 58 miles of former railroad corridors for recreational trails and over 570,000 acres of conservation and recreation lands including 332,000 acres of working lands with permanent conservation easements. Supporting documents Latest Round of Coastal Community Planning Grants Awarded January 30, 2019 For more information contact: Ruta Dzenis at: 207-287-2851 The Department of Agriculture Conservation and Forestry (DACF) has announced the award of nearly $270,00 through its Coastal Community Grant Program for six projects located throughout coastal Maine. This year's grants, awarded and administered by DACF's Municipal Planning Assistance Program, will help coastal communities by supporting planning to reduce flood damage to municipal infrastructure, restore fisheries habitat, protect working waterfronts, and increase the climate resiliency of coastal downtowns. The grants are made possible by the Maine Coastal Program, Department of Marine Resources, which provides funding through Maine's federal coastal zone management award from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Each project involves regional or local-level partnerships and each grantee provides a minimum of 25% in matching funds or services. The Coastal Community Grants are an important element of the Municipal Planning Assistance Program's mission to foster innovative and effective approaches to land use management by providing technical and financial assistance to Maine municipalities. This is the ninth round of Coastal Community Grants, which have provided $1.7 million for 65 projects in coastal Maine since 2012. This year, grants totaling $269,880 have been awarded to the following projects: Town of Bowdoinham: Re-Development of Public Works Waterfront Property ($45,750) Project Description: This project is part of the Town's efforts to re-develop the Town's former Public Works property on the Cathance River. With the Coastal Community Grant and matching funds, the Town and its subcontractors will conduct necessary surveys, produce preliminary and final designs and construction documents, and obtain permits for stabilizing the property's shorefront. The stabilization efforts will focus on one or more low-impact or living shoreline stabilization measures. Through public access, outreach and education, the Town will introduce \"green\" shoreline stabilization methods to visitors to the site and coordinate with the Maine Geological Survey on ways to use the site as a demonstration project to reach a wider audience. Project Partners: Maine Geological Survey, Maine Historic Preservation Commission Greater Portland Council of Governments - Proactive Watershed Management in Falmouth ($15,000) Project Description: This pro-active watershed planning project will evaluate existing data for watershed health (e.g., identify outliers and/or questionable data points); propose a list of metrics to serve as indicators of watershed health; establish thresholds for watershed metrics that measure or predict watershed health using scientific principles, as well as serve as a baseline for future planning efforts. This work will assist Falmouth to prioritize watershed management measures and to tailor those efforts to address the needs of each watershed, which will result in a case study to be shared with other municipalities. Project Partners: Town of Falmouth, Interlocal Stormwater Working Group, Falmouth Conservation Commission, and Maine Department of Environmental Protection Hancock County Planning Commission/Hancock County Soil & Water Conservation District - Eastern Bay Watershed Management Plan ($36,908) Project Description: The purpose of this project is to produce a management plan for the Eastern Bay within Frenchman Bay based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's nine-element approach. The project will focus activities in the Jordan River Watershed that may impact water quality and aquiculture in the Mount Desert Narrows area in Eastern Bay. The Eastern Bay Watershed Management Plan will guide watershed restoration efforts to reduce fecal bacteria contamination and to meet the goal of preventing shellfish closures in the river and embayment. Project Partners: Hancock County Soil & Water Conservation District, and Frenchman Bay Partners: Community Lab at MDI Biological Laboratory, University of Maine 610 project, Frenchman Bay Regional Shellfish Committee, College of the Atlantic, and Acadia Aquafarms City of South Portland - Vulnerability Assessment Mapping ($50,189) Project Description: The City's Sustainability Office will create an interactive, web-based vulnerability assessment map for South Portland. This map, which the City expects to update and maintain for a minimum of five years, will bring together disparate information related to historical flooding events, sea-level rise and storm projections, economic and social vulnerability, and critical infrastructure. Once created, local decision-makers, City staff, and the community will be able to switch on operational map layers and select their viewing area/zoom level to better understand the risks posed by coastal hazards. Key stakeholders will then have capacity to develop well-informed programs and policies to improve South Portland's resiliency. Project Partners: Gulf of Maine Research Institute, Southern Maine Planning & Development Commission, and Greater Portland Council of Governments Town of Stonington - Flood Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation Plan for Municipally Owned Infrastructure ($60,000) Project Description: The Town of Stonington will contract with an engineering consultant to assess the vulnerability of pumping stations, sewer lines, roads, and other critical municipal infrastructure to flooding due to coastal storms and projected sea-level rise. The consultant would provide options to mitigate and/or adapt to the effects of that flooding in order to allow continued use of vulnerable sections of the transportation network, sewer system, and other critical infrastructure. This assessment will then guide the Town's capital investments in its critical infrastructure to help ensure those systems will be useable for the next 100 years. Project Partners: Stonington Water Company, Town Departments, Downtown Stonington business owners and residents Washington County Council of Governments - Washington County Resilience ($62,033) Project Description: The overall goal of this project is to avoid infrastructure failure and increase resilience to coastal flooding and future sea-level rise in Washington County's most significant working waterfronts and largest coastal service centers. The project includes several subcomponents, including designing expanded working waterfront access in Machiasport, addressing roadbed and culvert vulnerabilities in Eastport, Jonesport, and Milbridge, supporting fish passage and increasing floodwater absorption by tidal marshes in Machias, and using a drone to obtain highly accurate data in Eastport, Lubec, Bucks Harbor, Jonesport, and Milbridge. Machiasport, Milbridge Maine DACF Seeks Specialty Crop Proposals February 25, 2019 For more information contact: Leigh Hallett at: 207-287-3494 The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) is accepting proposals for US Department of Agriculture Specialty Crop Block Grants (SCBG). DACF anticipates awarding approximately $500,000 in 2019. The Department's Agricultural Resource Development Division administers the program, and is the point of contact for Maine applicants. Since 2006, the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program has awarded nearly $6 million in Maine to support the growing number of specialty crop producers who are selling into local and regional markets. The program provides federal funding to projects identified as critical at the local level. Projects should enhance the competitiveness of Maine-grown specialty crops. Commodity groups, agricultural organizations, educational institutions, municipalities, producers, and state agencies are eligible. Each spring, the Department accepts applications and evaluates proposals through a competitive process. The Department submits its recommended proposals to USDA, and approved projects typically start in the fall. Specialty crops are defined by the USDA as \"fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops (including floriculture).\" Recent awards have supported research into new plant varieties, development of pest management strategies, technology innovations, school initiatives, and food safety projects. Funds have been used to improve harvests of blueberries, potatoes, maple syrup, hops, honey, and other crops. Awards are for one year only, but may be submitted for consideration for additional funding in subsequent years. Annual reports, regular invoices, and regular project updates are requirements of the program. Organizations of any size are eligible to apply for the grants, provided their projects serve multiple producers. The Department's priority areas for 2019 are as follows: - Ongoing funding for multi-year projects; these projects must submit a new proposal and demonstrate progress from the first year's funding in the work plan; - Enhancing food safety education, primarily in relation to new FDA rules regarding improved handling and processing of specialty crops; - Enhancing integrated pest management research and education for programs for specialty crops; - Research and demonstration of systems to market and distribute specialty crops to institutions; - Domestic and international market expansion of Maine specialty crops.

February 27, 2019 For more information contact: Maine Forest Service at: 207-287-2431 Helpful tips from State of Maine Entomologists AUGUSTA- This National Invasive Species Awareness Week, entomologists from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry remind you that now is the best time to remove browntail caterpillars from trees that are accessible. Browntail caterpillars cause a poison ivy-like rash and they are impacting a broad swath of Maine. Contact with this caterpillar's hairs can cause severe reactions for some individuals. Browntail caterpillars spend the winter webbed in silken-wrapped leaves on the tips of branches of oak, birch, cherry, apple and other hardwood trees. NOW is the time to look for the bright white silk tying a few leaves to the TIPS of oak and fruit tree branches. If you see a web CLIP IT OUT and destroy the web by dropping it in a bucket of soapy water and soaking it overnight; do not just leave it on the ground. The caterpillars are ready to go once warmer weather arrives, so do this task as soon as possible! Browntail caterpillar webs can be found regularly in Maine from the New Hampshire border to Deer Isle, and inland to Raymond, Turner, Rome, Smithfield, Burnham and Eddington. They are worst along the coast from Falmouth to Bristol and up the Kennebec River to Richmond. In 2017, outlying patches of defoliation were found in the towns of Belgrade, Burnham, Eddington, Liberty, Lincolnville, Turner and Whitefield. The moths have been seen all the way west to Kingfield, north to Ashland and east to Topsfield on the New Brunswick border. As we all have heard, \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" People have known that to be true of browntail for more than 100 years. Learn how to recognize browntail moth webs by visiting the websites below, then go out and check your trees for their presence. If you find them and can reach them, clip and destroy them. If you can't reach them and plan to treat them, now is the time to line up professional help for this spring. Don't have trees? Survey a public space in your town. If you think you've found webs, but are not sure, contact the Maine Forest Service for help. Additional advice may be obtained from your nearest [Cooperative Extension office](https://extension.umaine.edu/) or [Soil & Water Conservation District](https://maineconservationdistricts.com/district-locations/).

Forest Service staff peeled the bark off these branches to look for signs of emerald ash borer (EAB). Live EAB larvae were found on two of the trees sampled, one each from the towns of Acton and Berwick. Although these trees still appear completely healthy, they are infested with EAB. These were the first EAB found within trees in York County (the previous finds in Acton and Lebanon were adults that had flown into traps). Given this and the previous trapping survey, the Maine Forest Service knows that EAB is established, at least sporadically, within 3 miles of the New Hampshire border for at least 17 miles between Acton and Berwick. However, it is almost certain that they have spread further than this area. To get a clearer picture of where EAB is established in York County, the Maine Forest Service plans to work with landowners to girdle ash trees this spring, concentrating in towns near the New Hampshire border. These girdled trees will act as traps, drawing in EAB from the immediate area ( [more information on this survey](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab_trap_trees.htm)). The trees will be felled and peeled in the autumn to look for signs of EAB. With this information on establishment and population density, the Maine Forest Service will be able to move forward with managing EAB. If you have ash on your property and are interested in participating in this survey, please contact colleen.teerling@maine.gov for more information. Agriculture Day at the Legislature - March 21, 2019 March 19, 2019 For more information contact: DACF at: Press.DACF@maine.gov The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry (DACF) will be joining representatives of more than 25 nonprofit organizations, industry associations, societies, and others in celebrating Agriculture Day at the Legislature on Thursday, March 21st.

Express Your Opinion on Maine's Outdoor Recreation Priorities March 20, 2019 For more information contact: Rex Turner at: (207) 287-4920 The public is encouraged to participate in an online survey designed to inform recreation planning and funding priorities across Maine. Parks, playgrounds, ball fields, trails, water access - what outdoor recreation resources are your priority? The Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands and its partners want to know what influences your time spend in the outdoors, what activities you engage in, and what you see as priorities for the future. To make your voice heard, visit [https://mescorpsurvey.com](https://mescorpsurvey.com</a>) and take the Maine SCORP Survey. The Maine SCORP Survey is a 10-15-minute online survey developed to gain insights informing the development of the next Maine State Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan (Maine SCORP). Every five years, Maine submits a SCORP plan to the National Park Service to meet planning requirements for the [Federal\">https://www.doi.gov/lwcf\">Federal](<a) Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). Since its inception in 1966, LWCF has injected $43 million into non-federal projects in Maine. This funding, coming from offshore oil and gas leasing fees, has been used for outdoor recreation sites ranging from the Allagash Wilderness Waterway to ball fields and town parks across Maine. Municipalities, public schools, tribal governments, and the State of Maine are all eligible to receive LWCF grants for a wide variety of outdoor recreation acquisition and development projects. The Maine SCORP plan documents outdoor recreation supply and demand and discusses issues of statewide importance. It identifies priorities for expenditure of LWCF dollars in Maine and serves as a vision for strengthening communities through outdoor recreation investments. To be as effective as possible, the plan needs your input! You are encouraged to take and share the survey, found at: [https://mescorpsurvey.com](https://mescorpsurvey.com</a>.).

Invasive species professionals from around Maine, and expert guests from other New England states, will come together to share the latest news about threats and regulations, hear case studies of invasive species management, and learn about biological controls and new technologies. This year's meeting, which is expected to draw over 100 attendees, is organized by a team of Maine Invasive Species Network members from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF), University of Maine Cooperative Extension, Nutrien Solutions, Knox-Lincoln Soil and Water Conservation District, and Maine Coast Heritage Trust. \"We are very excited to help facilitate this gathering of invasive species professionals,\" remarked DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"Invasive species are a major threat to Maines natural resources, including our farms, forests, and conserved lands. Working together will enable us to prevent the introduction and spread of these harmful species, and learn how to best manage them where they are already established.\" Entomologists from New Hampshire will share their experience with the emerald ash borer, an invasive, destructive beetle that kills ash trees. The emerald ash borer was recently found in Maine and is expected to severely impact Maines ash trees. New Hampshire already has experience with the beetle and will provide perspective and lessons learned. Other experts will describe the use of biological controls for invasive plants and insects, and the use of eDNA technology for invasive species monitoring and research, with a focus on aquatic systems. \"These annual gatherings provide invaluable information for natural resource managers and researchers. Its a rare opportunity to get an overview of all the invasive species issues facing the state of Maine,\" according to Nancy Olmstead, invasive plant biologist at the Maine Natural Areas Program. The event is receiving generous financial support from Nutrien Solutions, Lake Stewards of Maine - Volunteer Lake Monitoring Program, the Maine Chapter of The Nature Conservancy, Solitude Lake Management, J.D.

Nancy McBrady has served as the Executive Director of the Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine. She joined the Wild Blueberry Commission in 2015 and directed programs for marketing and promotion, research and development, and policy engagement. During her tenure, McBrady has overseen the launch of a national school foodservice program that has resulted in a 157% increase in purchases of frozen Maine wild blueberries by public schools. McBrady, a Lewiston, Maine native, earned a B.A. at Williams College and began her career as a management consultant with AT Kearney in Chicago, before returning to Maine to attend the University of Maine School of Law. She went on to practice environmental, land use, and municipal law at one of the state's largest law firms. McBrady possesses a wealth of regulatory and policy experience, and a great enthusiasm for agriculture and its importance to Maine. \"We are very fortunate to have Nancy join us in this leadership role in the Bureau of Agriculture, Food & Rural Resources. Nancys experience and creativity, along with her energy and passion for supporting farmers, will greatly benefit our work within the Department and our overall efforts to serve Maines diverse agricultural sector, says Commissioner Beal. Emily Horton has worked as the Agriculture and Natural Resource Representative for Congresswoman Chellie Pingree. Horton has worked on natural resource-related policy issues at both the state and federal level for more than a decade. Through the 2018 Farm Bill, Horton worked to advance programs that support Maines resource-based economies, such as through broadband expansion, conservation and research funding, and value-added markets. Horton grew up on a farm in Waldo County where her family ran a small woodlot and operated a diversified farm. She holds a B.S. degree in Environmental Studies from Lesley University and a Master of Public Health degree from the University of New England. Previously, she worked at the Maine Organic Farmers & Gardeners Association and was the Health Promotion Manager at Central Maine Medical's Healthy Androscoggin Healthy Maine Partnership. Beal added, Nancy and Emily are each talented, knowledgeable and well-respected individuals, and to welcome them both as they join us at the Department simultaneously is truly exciting.\" Supporting documents Changes Bring Flexibility to Rural Economy, Protect the Environment April 2, 2019 On April 2nd in Farmington, the Land Use Planning Commission (LUPC or Commission) voted to change the rules that guide the location of development and the design of subdivisions in the LUPC's service area. The LUPC serves those places that have no local government or in which local government has chosen not to regulate land uses - an area that includes roughly half of the State of Maine. The revised rules encourage most new zones for subdivision and commercial development to locate close to towns that provide public services. At the same time, the rules allow some new outdoor recreation and woods-related businesses important to our evolving economy to be farther away. In some cases, new zones for subdivisions would be allowed away from town, but only on already developed lakes. The rules protect important habitat, keep development away from remote undeveloped lakes and ponds, protect consumers and support our rural economy. \"The new adjacency and subdivision rules are a practical approach to providing economic opportunity while still protecting Maines environment and controlling costs for public services,\" said LUPC chairperson Everett Worcester. The Commission worked hard to include a broad array of people interested in the future of the UT, and to make sure the review process was thoughtful and transparent. Rule changes about the location of development (sometimes called the adjacency principle) increase flexibility for recreation-based or woods-based businesses such as trail centers, mobile gear rental operations, or new kinds of wood fiber processing, while still protecting sensitive resources. Revised subdivision standards introduce new protections for wildlife habitat, ensure legal right of access for lot buyers, and give property owners more flexibility to tailor a subdivision design to the local area. Also, for the first time, the Commission is adopting visual impact standards specifically for hillside development. Hillside development standards will ensure that views from public places, which are important to Maine citizens as well as to the tourism economy, are protected. The adjacency review process took place over the last three years and included surveys, focus groups, community meetings, and hundreds of conversations with people who live, work, own property or recreate in the unorganized and deorganized areas, often called the UT. Officials from municipalities near the UT and officials from counties that administer public services in UT areas have participated in the public process. The rule changes will ensure that local emergency service providers are consulted before new subdivisions or businesses are approved so public costs can be minimized and any new development will not overburden rural fire departments and ambulance services. In adopting the rule revisions, the Commission recognized the significance of the change. The LUPC is committed to monitoring development trends closely to ensure that the changes we adopted have the positive effects that we anticipate, said Betsy Fitzgerald, Commission Vice-chair. The new rules will become effective this spring.

Free FarmShares Available for Eligible Maine Seniors April 2, 2019 For more information contact: Donna Murray at: 207-287-7526 AUGUSTA, Maine - Free-local-fresh produce for eligible Maine seniors! The Maine Senior FarmShare Program will provide 16,000 senior citizens with free fresh produce this year. Eligible Maine seniors can sign up through farmers in their area, starting immediately. Qualified participants will receive $50 of fresh produce during the season from one of approximately 100 local participating farms. Seniors contact participating farmers directly to sign up for the program. Farmers sign up seniors on a first-come, first-served basis, and the number of Senior FarmShares is limited at each farm. \"We're excited to provide so many seniors with free Senior FarmShares,\" said Donna Murray, the program manager. She continued, In a recent survey 91% of the seniors reported that they ate more fruits and vegetables because of the Maine Senior FarmShare Program and over 98% would like to participate in the program again. Our farmers love the interaction with the program recipients and, of course, it helps them financially as well. Participating Maine farmers provide the produce in a variety of ways. Seniors pick up their produce at a specific farmers market, or at their farm or farm stand. Some farmers offer delivery to seniors at their homes or housing sites. Farmers provide a broad range of produce during the growing season. FarmShare produce includes fresh, unprocessed fruits, vegetables, and herbs. To qualify, a participant must: - be a Maine resident, - at least 60 years old, - and have a household income of not more than 185 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines ($22,459/individual; $30,451/two-person household). Seniors can contact the Maine Area Agency on Aging at 877-353-3771 to find a participating farmer. Participating farmers can also be found online at [http://www.getrealmaine.com.](http://www.getrealmaine.com.) The Maine Senior FarmShare Program is run by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. The US Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service, Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP) funds the program. Based on a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) model, a Senior FarmShare is an agreement between a participating farmer and a qualified senior for $50 of fresh produce. For more information, contact Donna Murray, Program Manager, Maine Senior FarmShare Program, 207-287-7526, donna.murray@maine.gov or visit: [Maine Senior Farmshare on GetRealMaine.com](https://www.getrealmaine.com/index.cfm/fuseaction/home.showpage/pageID/77/index.htm). Comments Received on the Maine Senior FarmShare Program From Participating Seniors: I really appreciate the FarmShare Program. As a senior on a fixed income, I wouldnt enjoy as many fresh vegetables without it. I hope everyone appreciates this program as much as I do. I love veggies and had a garden all my life. At 93, I just cant anymore, but I am still on my own! Eating delicious, fresh, and beautiful veggies was very good for my health! And getting to talk with friends that I dont see very often was good for my soul! I am in my 80s, a vet of WWII and Korea, and I think the FarmShare is something to be so thankful for. The quality, freshness, and very generous bags full-delivered to our Senior Apartment Complex! Thank you for giving me the produce; I never knew how much better tasting fresh veggies were! From a Participating Farmer: Many of our senior participants have had gardens of their own and we have learned a great deal from their experiences and have received some wonderful recipes from them. Our seniors have so much knowledge and experience that we feel lucky to be able to get to know them better. We love being able to give out produce and, of course, the program gives us a big financial boost in the springtime when we need it most. We are so grateful for our seniors and for this program. Maine Quarantine on Emerald Ash Borer Announced April 17, 2019 For more information contact: Gary Fish at: 207-287-7545 Augusta, ME - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry has announced a formal quarantine on emerald ash borer (EAB) and material that may harbor it. The quarantine area includes all of York County and the northeastern corner of Aroostook County. The quarantine boundaries were drawn to include a buffer on those towns where EAB had been detected. EAB was found in northern Aroostook County in May 2018 and in western York County in September 2018. An emergency order has been in place to limit movement of infested ash from areas where the pest has been found since those discoveries. Quarantine rules prohibit movement of ash nursery stock from the quarantine area, and regulate the movement of hardwood firewood, hardwood chips and other ash products with bark, such as logs and pulp, and untreated ash lumber. Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry staff, in partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Plant Protection and Quarantine are working with the public and impacted industries to ensure compliance with the quarantine. \"A quarantine can help slow the spread of this destructive insect into uninfested areas,\" said State Entomologist Allison Kanoti. \"That gives businesses, Native American craftspeople and artists that use ash as well as homeowners, landowners and municipalities who care for ash across the state additional time to consider their options and make plans for a future with EAB.\" That future will include far fewer ash trees. Maine forests have more than 400 million white, green, and brown ash trees at risk. Ash is also an important street tree in towns and cities. EAB is an invasive wood-boring beetle that attacks ash trees by disrupting the flow of water and nutrients causing the tree to die. Native ash trees have little resistance to attack, and often die within a few years of initial arrival of the beetle. EAB was first discovered in North America in 2002. Since its arrival, it has killed hundreds of millions of ash trees. White ash shows some resistance to and tolerance of attack by EAB. A fraction of those trees may be able to survive in the presence of EAB. The US Department of Agriculture has been working on a program to provide ash with another form of defense-tiny wasps from Asia that attack the eggs or young of EAB and may eventually bring their populations to a tolerable level. Despite these glimmers of hope, EAB will devastate ash in Maine. Cities and towns from New England through the Midwest report damage to infrastructure such as power lines and hazards to people related to the deterioration of ash trees attacked by this insect. Ash will be lost as a functional part of forest ecosystems, joining the ranks of American elm and American chestnut. Ash will no longer be available as a material for forest products including baseball bats, baskets, tool handles, flooring, cabinetry and others. The goal of the quarantine is to slow the spread of the insect to delay impacts to the ecosystem, native culture and economy. Additional information on EAB, how to recognize and report its damage, and details of the Maine ash quarantine, can be found at [http://www.maine.gov/eab.](http://www.maine.gov/eab.) \"Feathers over Freeport\" Offers Birding Fun for All Ages April 18, 2019 For more information contact: Andy Hutchinson at: (207) 865-4465 AUGUSTA - The ninth annual \"Feathers over Freeport\" event will take place on April 27th and 28th.

The tagging effort coincides with Maine Arbor Week and National Emerald Ash Borer Awareness Week, May 19-25, 2019. \"Over 100 million ash trees have died across the country from the emerald ash borer since its original detection in Michigan in 2002. In 2018, EAB was discovered in Maine for the first time. Although the infestations are confined to northern Aroostook County and southwestern York County, every community with ash trees is at risk. Awareness and early detection provide the best opportunity for management in our communities and in the forest,\" explained Colleen Teerling, Entomologist with DACF. Adult emerald ash borers are tiny, about the width of a penny, and infest trees from the top down, making detection particularly difficult. In most areas where it is found, trees are already dead or dying, meaning the insect was there for years before detection. Surveillance efforts in the state include hanging purple prism traps in ash trees, girdling ash trees to act as detection trap trees, bio-surveillance with a native stingless, ground-nesting wasp, and public education and awareness. During Maine Arbor Week and Emerald Ash Borer Awareness Week, Maine cities and towns are tagging ash trees for public awareness. These tags identify which trees in the landscape are ash, helping citizens understand the visual impact this insect will have on our streets and in our forests, if left unchecked. The tags also have a calculated value based on size that will give the public an understanding of the environmental and economic values trees provide on an annual basis. Because ash trees grow quickly and are very tolerant of poor growing conditions, they are a popular choice for a street tree. Some Maine towns are planted with as much as 30% ash. Its ironic, given that many main streets were lined not that long ago with majestic American elm trees, another tree lost to an invasive forest pest. Many of the ash trees on our streets and parks were planted in the wake of Dutch elm disease, when we lost our elms 30-40 years ago. To organize a community tree-tagging event, contact Jan Santerre, Project Canopy Director at (207) 287-4987.

Nearly 500 7th graders attended from Skowhegan, China, Madison, Valley, Warsaw, and Waterville participated in the Friday, May 10, 2019 event. Over 40 organizations and businesses presented hands-on learning opportunities in fields such as logging, forestry, recreation, and agriculture. Local colleges were also on hand to inform students of related training opportunities. The Concept Outdoor Career Exploration was inspired by conversations DACF Farm Labor Link Network staff had with farmers. Yvette Meunier, Promotional Coordinator for the DACF, explained that \"Over the summer I met with farmers and listened to their ideas for supporting Maine's next generation of farmers.\" From these conversations two themes became clear 1) The need to strengthen our industrial arts programming and 2) Opportunities to engage younger students with insightful agricultural and outdoor career information. The event concept was a good fit for the JMG team as well. Tracie Travers, Workforce Development Manager for JMG stated \"JMG provides a continuum of support to 9,000 students a year from grade six through post-secondary education and into the workforce. Exposing students to pathways to success is what we do and our hope is this event will inspire more young people to begin planning for promising futures.\" JMG has built a strong network of Maine business partners committed to working to address the labor shortage and to provide quality employment opportunities. Results Outdoor Career Exploration is designed to introduce students to outdoor careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and to inform and inspire teachers to bring agricultural literacy into the classroom. Prior to the event, Maine Agriculture in the Classroom staff and JMG specialists delivered an Ag Explorer Career Finder pre-teach curriculum created in partnership with National Farms for the Future (FFA) and Discovery Education to several of the schools attending the event. [Career Finder](https://www.agexplorer.com/career-interactive) compares a students strengths and interests and matches them to the myriad of career paths in agriculture. Careers in agriculture are careers in STEM. From the biology of plants, soils, and animal health, to learning how to be good stewards of the environment, to using technology for precision agriculture and running efficient operations, teaching agriculture is essential to fostering an appreciation for and interest in sustaining a productive landscape, says Kelsey Fortin, Program Assistant with Maine Agriculture in the Classroom. A copy of the pre-teach curriculum can be found here: [https://www.agexplorer.com/career-interactive](https://www.agexplorer.com/career-interactive) Schools received a generous donation of a fruit tree from ReTreeUS to start their own school orchards. ReTreeUS is a non-profit dedicated to promoting an environmentally sustainable, socially just food system by planting orchards with local schools and providing educational programs that empower young people and their families to grow their own home orchards and gardens. According to Richard Hodges, ReTreeUS Program Manager, ReTreeUS Believes that by engaging students in the process of growing their own food and caring for trees, we can create a lasting impact for both the schools and their students. ReTreeUS will also be available to the schools to teach lessons on their role in the orchard, starting with a conversation about the impact growing their own food has on their health and that of our planet. # Supporting documents $1,136,250 in Land for Maine's Future Funding Allocated to Support Working Waterfront Access June 21, 2019 Augusta - The Land for Maine's Future Board has selected six projects that will help protect and sustain Maines working waterfront. Through the Working Waterfront Access Protection Program, funds have been set-aside to purchase development rights, through a legally binding agreement between the state and working waterfront owners, which will ensure that the property remains available to support commercial fishing or aquaculture activities. Stonington Co-op at 51 Indian Point Road in Stonington has received a preliminary allocation of $216,250 under the program. The funds will be used to conduct site work which will improve shipping and receiving of lobsters and bait. The co-ops plans include the construction of a 2,000 square foot wharf that will allow boats to unload light gear and will provide 12 additional parking spaces. The site currently supports 40 fishing vessels that harvest lobster and scallops and the expansion will also allow the co-op to provide additional shoreside resources for aquaculture operations. The Town of Jonesport, home to 500 commercial fishermen, has received a preliminary allocation of $118,750 which it will use for site design and engineering, access road and parking development, and installation of a boat ramp and two floats at Henrys Point, currently the location of a campground. The site will continue to support recreational activity, but its development as a commercial site will relieve pressure on a nearby state-owned marina, which provides the only public boat access in Jonesport. Wottons Lobster Wharf, LLC in New Harbor plans to use funds awarded by the LMF Board to install an above ground fuel tank, additional bait storage, and a new float with lobster crate storage at its 86 Southside Road, New Harbor location. Wottons Wharf is currently used by four vessels year-round for lobster and Bluefin Tuna fishing. By improving infrastructure, the project offers the potential to add four additional full-time fishing crews and vessels. Their preliminary allocation totals $68,750. A preliminary allocation of $301,500 has been given to the Boothbay Region Maritime Foundation which it will use for the demolition and reconstruction of Carters Wharf at 87 Atlantic Avenue in Boothbay Harbor. Carters Wharf is home to 30 lobster fishing vessels and a lobster buying station run by Lukes Lobster. The new wharf could potentially serve an additional 10-15 vessels as well as aquaculture operations and allow other types of fish to be landed including crab and tuna. Lobster co-op Interstate Lobster, Inc. in Harpswell will use funds allocated by the LMF board to support the demolition, replacement and expansion of the existing wharf at 241 Ash Point Road. The project will improve the structural integrity of the wharf, built in 1978 and suffering from cracked and split under pinnings which have cost the co-op $10,000-$30,000 per year to maintain. The wharf supports 21 co-op members and 20 additional boats that land lobsters, scallops and menhaden. Their preliminary allocation totals $155,000. The Spruce Head Fishermans Co-op at 275 Island Road in South Thomaston will use the $276,000 allocated by the board to pay off a loan used to purchase adjacent property which will be used to expand parking and storage for the co-ops 54 members. The co-op will then refinance the property and use the money to install a bait freezer which will help the members address potential bait shortages. Preliminary allocations represent LMF board support for the projects, however before funds are disbursed, applicants must submit an appraisal, and complete all real estate due-diligence to the satisfaction of the State. The Working Waterfront Access Protection Program is part of the Land for Maines Future Program. The Working Waterfront Access Protection Program fund was first capitalized by a bond originally passed in 2005 and has been renewed three times since by Maine voters. Funds are allocated by the LMF Board to support projects that sustain access to the waterfront for commercial fishing and aquaculture in exchange for development rights through a legal document called a Working Waterfront Covenant. To-date, 25 properties have received funds through the program. The program is administered by the Maine Department of Marine Resources and the Land for Maine's Future Program. More information on the program can be found at [https://www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf/publications.shtml#wwapp](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf/publications.shtml#wwapp) About Land for Maine's Future: The Land for Maine's Future Program (LMF) is the State of Maine's primary funding vehicle for conserving land for its natural and recreational value. The program was established in 1987 when Maine citizens voted to fund $35 million to purchase lands of statewide importance. In 32 years, LMF has assisted in the protection of 59 water access sites, 41 farms totaling more than 9,755 acres, 24 commercial working waterfront properties, more than 1,200 miles of shore lands, 158 miles of former railroad corridors for recreational trails and over 600,919 acres of conservation and recreation lands including 333,425 acres of working lands with permanent conservation easements. LMF has garnered broad based support because it respects landowner rights by acquiring land only from willing sellers, pursues a mission defined by the public, provides a tangible return to everyone who cherishes Maine's landscape, from hunters, to hikers, snowmobilers to bird watchers, and leverages both federal and private funding for state priority purchases.

The Best Firewood Is Local Firewood July 2, 2019 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 287-3156 AUGUSTA, Maine - A new season of outdoor recreation brings new focus to the dangers posed to our forests by invasive forest insects and diseases, often spread by infested firewood. Recreationists and camp owners need to be aware of the threats invasive forest pests pose to Maine's natural resources. The 2018 discovery of emerald ash borer (EAB) in two areas within Maine adds even more urgency to this message. Use Local Maine Firewood It is still illegal to bring untreated firewood from out of state across Maines borders, even into York County or Northern Aroostook County where EAB quarantines exist. The presence of EAB within Maine also makes movement of firewood within the state a concern. It is now illegal to move untreated firewood out of York County and the Northeastern tip of Aroostook County into other parts of Maine. Even within these quarantined areas, everyone is being asked to consider how their actions can impact the movement of EAB and other forest threats. If you live in an area which is still free of EAB and have ash firewood from near an infested area, please try to burn it as soon as possible to reduce the risk of EAB adults emerging and starting a new infestation. As always, MFS recommends burning firewood within 50 miles of where it was harvested. This reduces the chance of moving a yet-undiscovered insect or disease long distances. Resources About the Maine Forest Service (MFS) Established in 1891, the MFS mission is to protect and enhance Maine's forest resources through forest fire prevention; technical assistance; education and outreach to a wide variety of audiences; and enforcement of the States forest protection laws.

Supporting documents Commissioner Amanda Beal appeals to USDA to include wild blueberries in its Market Facilitation Program July 10, 2019 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 287-3156 In light of challenges faced by Maine's wild blueberry growers, Maine Agriculture Commissioner Amanda Beal appeals to USDA to include wild blueberries in its Market Facilitation Program AUGUSTA, Maine - In May, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) launched its Market Facilitation Program (MFP) for 2019. Established during fall 2018 to assist growers negatively impacted by foreign nation trade retaliation, MFP will provide $14.5 billion in direct payments to producers in 2019. To date, wild blueberries are not included on USDA's MFP crop list. This week, Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal sent a letter to USDA Undersecretary Bill Northey, asking for wild blueberries to be added to the list. \"Maine often receives little to no direct benefit when it comes to federal programs that historically support larger commodity producers in other parts of the country,\" said Commissioner Beal. \"Our agriculture industries are deeply connected to the economic and cultural vitality of Maine, and they deserve this needed support; therefore, the USDA should include Maine wild blueberry growers in this important program, just as cherries, cranberries and fresh grape producers are.\" Beal rightfully makes a case for wild blueberry inclusion, the full text of the letter follows: July 8, 2019 Honorable Undersecretary Bill Northey United States Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Ave., S.W. Washington, DC 20250 Re: Market Facilitation Program and Maine Wild Blueberries Dear Undersecretary Northey, Maines iconic wild blueberry crop has been threatened by declining prices for farmers in recent years and the situation has been exacerbated by global trade tensions. Maine is the only state in the U.S. that grows wild blueberries on a commercial scale. The industry is comprised of growers and processors who have worked hard to produce this healthy and delicious commodity for over 150 years. Faced by economic pressures and reduced prices, many growers have drastically cut back on harvesting their crop within the past two years and will continue to do so this coming crop season. (1) Some have left the business altogether -- a huge blow to local communities and economies in rural Downeast Maine. The reduction in acreage has precipitously dropped the supply of wild blueberries on the market. For these reasons it is my contention that wild blueberry growers would be well served by being included in USDAs Market Facilitation Program. Between 2013 and 2016, the production of Maine and Canadian wild blueberries increased dramatically, with the total 2016 production increasing by 87% over 2013 (the majority of which was produced in Canada). (2) The resulting oversupply situation drove prices down drastically for Maine growers. (3) Despite this, exports to China of frozen Maine wild blueberries were slowly and steadily increasing. However, the China market effectively evaporated in early 2018. (4) Reliable and open access to foreign markets is a critical factor in enhancing global demand for Maine wild blueberries and driving positive price growth. The Maine wild blueberry industry has received assistance from USDA in recent years through the Section 32 Bonus Buy program which helped reduce the oversupply of 2014-2016 berries. Similarly, USDA has purchased frozen wild blueberries through its Food Purchase and Distribution Program. However, as I am sure you are aware, neither of these programs directly finance the growers themselves. It is my understanding the Market Facilitation Program will allow for direct compensation to farmers. Notably, the Program already includes other fruit farmers: cherries and cranberries. Wild blueberries are similarly nutritious and versatile in that they are minimally processed and will keep for 18+ months when frozen. Moreover, due to the fact wild blueberry plants thrive in very acidic soil, they cannot simply be replaced by other diversified crops. In light of the enormous struggles facing wild blueberry growers at present and the documented curtailment of harvested acreage, we actively encourage USDA to list them as qualified participants within the Market Facilitation Program. This would be an extremely positive and welcome step to assist Maine growers in what has been an incredibly stressful and difficult time period of trade tensions. Thank you for your consideration. I would be happy to answer any questions that you or your staff may have regarding the Maine wild blueberry industry. Very Truly Yours, Amanda Beal Commissioner Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry cc: Hon. Secretary Sonny Perdue, USDA Hon. Senator Susan Collins Hon. Senator Angus King Hon. Representative Chellie Pingree Hon. Representative Jared Golden David Lavway, Director Maine FSA (1) According to 2017 USDA Census data, wild blueberry acreage has dropped from 44,000 acres to 38,660 since 2012. Small growers in particular have reduced their acreage as the cost of production have exceeded the price for their product. We anticipate that records of total managed acreage could be provided by growers to USDA to effectuate participation in the Market Facilitation Program.

Because of a lack of clarity in current regulation, some farms outside of Maine have been allowed by their organic certifier to repeatedly transition non-organic livestock into their herd at a lower cost, instead of organically raising substitute cattle after a one-time herd transition. This creates an unlevel playing field for organic farmers in Maine, who are abiding by the original intent of this regulation. \"We continue to be deeply troubled by what is happening to the dairy industry,\" Governor Mills and Commissioner Beal wrote in a letter today. On behalf of the Maine dairy industry, we urge you to take immediate action to finalize the proposed Origin of Livestock Rule and to not waste any more valuable time by proposing new rules to consider. The full text of the letter follows. In response to the letter, Maine dairy groups have voiced their support: Organic dairy farmers in Maine are grateful to have the support of Governor Mills and Commissioner Beal in our attempt to get the final rule for origin of livestock passed into regulation. Dairy farmers across the country are struggling with low milk prices and higher costs, and while organic dairy was once immune to these price fluctuations, that is no longer the case. The USDA must do what is right to uphold the integrity of the organic program and maintain consumer trust. Small family farms are the backbone of our rural communities and it is more important now, than ever, to do whatever we can to protect this way of life on which so many of us depend. - Annie Watson, President of the Maine Organic Milk Producers. Organic dairy farmers in Maine have committed to compliance in an effort to maintain accountability with consumers. Because of a few farms in other parts of the U.S. who have stretched their interpretation of organic to achieve higher profit margins, Maine farms who have adhered to the intent have been pushed out of the marketplace. USDA needs to finalize and enforce the NOP rule to reassure consumer confidence and create a level playing field for all U.S. organic dairy farmers. - Julie-Marie Bickford, Executive Director of the Maine Dairy Industry Association Beyond calling for immediate action, Mills and Beal call for consistent and fair application of all NOP rules; the full text of the letter follows: The Honorable Sonny Perdue Secretary, U.S. Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Ave., S.W. Washington, D.C. 20250 Dear Secretary Perdue: We write to urge you to finalize the National Organic Program's (NOP) 2015 proposed Origin of Livestock rule which greatly impacts the markets and viability of Maine dairy farmers. We continue to be deeply troubled by what is happening to the dairy industry. According to the 2017 Census of Agriculture, commercial milk operations in Maine dropped from 367 in 2012 to 286 in 2017, a decrease of 22 percent in 5 years. In Maine and across the county, dairy farmers are struggling to keep their businesses open because of a plethora of challenging issues, such as unpredictable markets resulting in low payments to farmers, high costs of production, labor issues, and extremely low profit margins. At the same time, the demand for the organic market continues to increase and nationally, the number of organic farms increased from 14,326 to 18,166 between 2012 and 2017 and the total value of organic sales increased 57 percent, from 3.1 billion to 7.2 billion. Yet, recent issues with oversupply in other parts of the country directly impacts the viability of Maine organic dairy farms, as over 25 percent of our commercial dairy farms are selling to organic processors. On average, Maine organic dairy farmers spend $600-$1,300 more per calf than farmers who raise calves conventionally. They follow strict rules and guidelines and are greatly concerned that a few bad actors in other parts of the country are taking advantage of the organic system by diverging from organic standards. The proposed rules would help clarify the standards regarding the transition of conventional dairy cows to organic and the management of breeder stock on organic livestock farms. Finalizing the proposed rule is an immediate action that the USDA can take to provide much needed relief to dairy farmers. The industry has overwhelmingly supported these changes for over a decade, including thousands of public comments that are on the record in support of the proposed rulemaking. We are grateful to have the support of the rest of the Maine delegation on this issue, who have supported language requests which would require the USDA to finalize the proposed rule within 180 days of enactment, in addition to incorporating the comments and feedback from the public during the rulemaking process. On behalf of the Maine dairy industry, we urge you to take immediate action to finalize the proposed Origin of Livestock Rule and to not waste any more valuable time by proposing new rules to consider. Furthermore, we would also like to take this opportunity to call for consistent and fair application of all NOP rules, particularly the Access to Pasture rule. The inconsistent enforcement of this rule disadvantages those farmers who adhere to it and harms the organic market and integrity of the NOP itself. There are many stresses that farmers face, and lax or improper application of the NOP rules should not be one of them. Sincerely, Janet T.

The Obsolete Pesticides Collection Program, funded through pesticide product registration fees, has kept more than 106 tons of pesticides out of the waste stream since its start in 1982. This free annual program is open to homeowners and family-owned farms and greenhouses. Collections will occur at four sites: Presque Isle, Jonesboro, Augusta, and Portland. Pre-registration is required by Monday, October 7, 2019 and unregistered drop-offs are not permitted. All details including drop off locations and program dates will be supplied following registration. To register and access important information about the temporary storage and transportation of obsolete pesticides, visit the BPC website at [http://www.thinkfirstspraylast.org,](http://www.thinkfirstspraylast.org,) or call 207-287-2731. Pesticides being accepted include: herbicides, insecticides, rodenticides, fungicides and similar products used in agricultural production or around the home. Past participants in the program have reported finding obsolete pesticides in barns of inherited properties, garages of newly purchased homes, and other unexpected places. While removal of these pesticides can seem daunting, it is important for the protection of public, wildlife and environmental health, that they are dealt with properly and not thrown in the trash or poured down the drain, where they can contaminate land and water resources. \"The Obsolete Pesticide Collection Program is an excellent opportunity for free disposal of unusable and unwanted pesticides,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. Register in advance, bring your pesticides to one of the designated collection sites, and let the professionals dispose of these materials in a responsible and safe way. DEP Commissioner Jerry Reid is encouraging Mainers to take full advantage of this free opportunity. When improperly disposed ofin the trash, poured into the environment, down the drain, or kept in storage for long periods of timepesticides threaten wildlife and the quality of our drinking water sources, said Jerry Reid, DEP Commissioner. - More information about Maine Board of Pesticides Control can be found at [http://www.thinkfirstspraylast.org](http://www.thinkfirstspraylast.org) - Information about Maine Department of Environmental Protection is at [maine.gov/dep](http://maine.gov/dep) # Invasive Plants in Maine Field Guide! New resources from Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry and the Maine Natural Areas Program September 6, 2019 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 287-3156 The newly published Maine Invasive Plants Field Guide has been selling like hotcakes! People want to know more about invasive plants in Maine because these plants crowd out native trees in our forests, form monocultures in wetlands, over-grow productive fields and pastures, and create dense thickets favorable for disease-carrying ticks. This field guide is waterproof, fits in a cargo or vest pocket, and covers 46 invasive plant species. Each species account includes photos and details about identification, range, similar species, control strategies, invasiveness, and status. Copies can be ordered by calling 207-287-2801 and paying by credit card, or by using this [order form](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/about/publications/mipfg_order_form.pdf). Cost including tax and shipping is $30. Maine Invasive Plants Field Guide also includes a comprehensive section on how to manage invasive plants, Integrated Pest Management, prioritization, assessment, manual and herbicide control, disposal, and monitoring. Each landowner or land manager can make a difference through careful invasive plant management which improves habitat for beneficial native plants, insects, and other wildlife. The [Maine Advisory List of Invasive Plants](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/features/invasive_plants/invsheets.htm) has been recently revised and officially [endorsed](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/features/invasive_plants/2019endorsement.pdf) by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF). The Advisory List is a useful tool for landowners, land managers, foresters, and other natural resource professionals because it includes all invasive plants (not just those arriving via horticulture), and plants are ranked according to their invasive threat. The Advisory List is separate from DACF's [Do Not Sell list](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/horticulture/invasiveplants.shtml), which is a regulatory list of invasive plants previously in the horticulture trade. These new resources help landowners make informed decisions about invasive plant management on their woodlots, farms, or natural areas. DACF-MNAP encourages landowners and land managers to check for invasive plants, report them using the [online mapping tool iMapInvasives](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/features/invasive_plants/imap.htm), and take action to control them.

Irving Limited's Fish River Chain of Lakes Concept Plan in northeastern Aroostook County, authorizing zoning for up to 330 residences, a small commercial development area and four community and economic development areas, and restricting for the life of the plan, most development in the balance of the plan area. The plan also establishes procedures for sale of existing leased lots that protect residents road access and lake water quality; includes permanent conservation of over 16,000 acres and long-term public access to lakes, and guarantees public recreational trail access for the life of the plan. The concept plan does not authorize specific residential or commercial development to begin; it establishes a process through which Irving may sell leases and identifies areas where development may be located in the future after additional permitting reviews. The Fish River chain of lakes is a series of five lakes located in northernmost Maine, north and west of Caribou and south of Frenchville. With today's approval, the plan will be effective as soon as Thursday, September 26, 2019. The LUPC will be meeting with the community to review the plan and answer questions on Wednesday, September 25, in Caribou. A copy of the LUPC Staff Recommendation and the concept plan are available on the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry webpage at [https://www.maine.gov/dacf/lupc/.](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/lupc/.)

Commissioner Amanda Beal Votes Yes to Endorse Climate Resiliency Policy Amendment at National Association of State Departments of Agriculture Annual Meeting September 13, 2019 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 287-3156 Augusta, ME - This week, the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) adopted a new climate policy during the organization's Annual Meeting in Albuquerque, NM. This policy encourages climate smart agriculture programs and initiatives at the federal level and confirms the necessity of adapting to protect and enhance our nation's natural resources, while also building resilient agricultural and food supply chains. \"Agriculture and our overall food system play an important role in climate change discussions. Passing this policy amendment, which was unanimously endorsed by the Northeastern Association (NEASDA) prior to the vote by the full NASDA membership, is about advocating for farmers across the country in a unified voice, many of whom are already practicing climate smart growing techniques,\" said Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"Now, more than ever, we must support farming communities by enabling them to access the tools and resources they need to enhance their role in both climate change mitigation and adaptation. I am excited to continue supporting these efforts taking place across the country and making sure Maine agriculture has a voice at the table.\" Beal and fellow state Commissioners, Secretaries and Directors of departments of agriculture from throughout the U.S. also supported policy amendments aimed at reducing food waste, improving the pricing structure for dairy farmers, and encouraging the FDA to develop a regulatory framework for hemp production and CBD products derived from hemp. More on these action items can be found at [www.nasda.org](http://www.nasda.org). Excerpt: NASDA Agriculture, Resiliency and Climate Adaption policy amendment follows: Many farmers and ranchers are already using climate smart strategies to reduce emissions, sequester carbon, and improve resiliency. Investing in research, incentive programs for voluntary practices and technical assistance will equip farmers and ranchers with additional options to protect and conserve natural resources through on-farm practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase carbon sequestration, and adjust to a changing climate. - NASDA supports voluntary, incentive-based climate smart agricultural programs. These are programs designed to sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes; help farmers and ranchers build resiliency and climate adaptation; and, reduce and/or remove greenhouse gas emissions, where possible. - NASDA believes that advocacy and further outreach is needed to increase policy makers and consumers awareness of the environmentally sustainable on-farm work of farmers and ranchers and the risks of climate change to the agricultural industry and food security. - NASDA encourages the collaboration of governments, corporations and philanthropic communities with state departments of agriculture and local communities to further the establishment and expansion of voluntary, incentive-based climate smart agricultural programs.

This funding is provided by the US Department of Interior. \"It's more important than ever that we give Maine people the opportunity to get outdoors and enjoy our spectacular parks and public lands,\" Cutko shared in a statement. LWCF funding is a vital piece of federal support that allows us to protect and maintain these open spaces. For decades Mainers have strongly supported the conservation of our forests, rivers, and lakes, and we thank our federal delegation for helping to make this funding possible.\" While big-name parks get the recognition, parks in local communities receive the most impact from this program. Local parks enhance the quality of life in any community and improve public health; they also increase property values and support economic development, said Douglas Beck, Supervisor of Outdoor Recreation at BPL. Of the more than 850 LWCF sites in Maine, 650 are community-based projects spanning the state from Frenchville to Kittery. LWCF has preserved open space and created parks for nearly every resident in Maine, whether they know it or not. Beck is tasked with administering Maines LWCF funding. About LWCF Funds The LWCF was established by Congress in 1964 to ensure public access to outdoor recreation resources for present and future generations, and to provide money to federal, state and local governments to purchase land, water and wetlands for the benefit of all Americans. Funds are also used to permanently conserve outdoor recreation areas for public use and enjoyment. The funds enable state and local governments to improve parks and other recreation areas in their communities by rehabilitating and upgrading existing parks, creating brand new parks in places that have none, and developing and expanding trail systems to link communities together and create recreation opportunities. Since the inception of the LWCF, more than $4.4 billion has been made available to state and local governments to fund more than 43,000 projects throughout the nation. About Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands BPLs mission is to protect and manage the natural and cultural resources under its care in order to offer a wide range of recreational and educational opportunities and provide environmental and economic benefits for present and future generations. BPL has oversight of over two million acres of land, including State Parks, conservation easements and leases. BPL lands are managed for a variety of resource values including recreation, cultural and historic preservation, ecological protection wildlife; and timber. # Latest Round of Coastal Community Planning Grants Awarded September 24, 2019 For more information contact: Ruta Dzenis at: 287-2851 Augusta, Maine- The Municipal Planning Assistance Program, a division of Department of Agriculture Conservation and Forestry's Bureau of Resource Information and Land Use Planning, today announced the award of nearly $145,000 to four projects through its Coastal Community Grant Program. This year's grants help coastal communities by supporting: - green infrastructure design to address run-off and erosion and restore coastal habitat; - dam redesign to provide for fish passage and improve inland and coastal resilience; - studying saltwater intrusion on island water supply; - advancing work in GIS economic vulnerability assessments of flood hazard impacts to coastal property and evaluating associated implications to municipal tax base, and developing locally relevant, strategies to help towns prepare for sea level rise. Coastal Community Grants are made possible by the Maine Coastal Program, Department of Marine Resources, which provides funding through Maines federal coastal zone management award from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Each project involves regional or local-level partnerships and each grantee provides a minimum of 25% in matching funds or services. Grants totaling $143,229 were awarded to the following projects: Bustins Island Village Corporation: Green Infrastructure Design ($17,802) Project Description: Funds will support further analysis of upland hydrology and stormwater run-off which aggravates bluff erosion to inform detailed, actionable designs for green infrastructure to slow and retain upland rainfall. The goal of the project is to design adaptive green infrastructure to replenish the island's aquifer, restore native habitat, reduce stormwater run-off. \"Living shoreline\" bluff protection and repair will be examined in addition to other alternative designs. Project Partner: Cumberland County Soil and Water Conservation District Camden: Camden Harbor Park Seawall and Montgomery Dam Redesign ($40,000) Project Description: Funds will help Camden complete engineering and design plans for the partial or full removal of the Montgomery Dam and the reconfiguration of the seawall and adjacent area in Camdens Harbor Park. The project will result in a final design for modifications to the Montgomery Dam and reconfiguration of the adjacent seawall and adjacent area in Harbor Park to improve coastal and inland flood resilience and the passage of fish and other species from Camden Harbor up the Megunticook. Overall this project is an essential step in addressing more frequent storm surge events and improving the health of the entire Watershed. Project Partners: Island Institute, Megunticook Watershed Association, Coastal Mountains Land Trust, The Nature Conservancy, Georges River Chapter of Trout Unlimited Monhegan Plantation: Alternative water supply feasibility study ($39,240) Project Description: Monhegan and the Monhegan Water Company will conduct a risk assessment of their sole source fresh water aquifer in light of recent studies predicting flood hazard scenarios related to sea level rise and increased storm surge. The Study will examine current groundwater fed bedrock wells to gauge vulnerability to saltwater intrusion and evaluate the feasibility of drilled bedrock wells as a safer and more reliable alternative public water source for residents of Monhegan. Project Partners: Island Institute, Lincoln County Regional Planning Commission, Monhegan Water Company Southern Maine Planning and Development Commission : Tides, Taxes and New Tactics ($46,187) Project Description: Working closely with the municipalities of York, Kennebunk and Wells, the project team will investigate municipal-level economic and social impacts of sea level rise and storm surge hazards and develop locally-relevant adaptation and resiliency planning strategies that address local and regional vulnerabilities. The project team and advisory committee will use recently updated and downscaled sea level rise projections, storm surge modeling, and local tax and property data, to conduct a GIS-based economic vulnerability assessment of flood hazard impacts to coastal private property, evaluate associated implications for the municipal tax base, and research, evaluate, and implement locally relevant, creative adaptation strategies to help towns and the region prepare for sea level rise. Project Partners: Towns of York, Kennebunk and Wells, Wells National Estuarine Research Reserve, Maine SeaGrant, Island Institute About Coastal Community Grants Coastal Community Grants are an important element of the Municipal Planning Assistance Programs mission of fostering innovative and effective approaches to land use management by providing technical and financial assistance to Maine municipalities. This was the tenth round of grants, which since 2012 have provided $1.87 million for 69 projects throughout coastal Maine. At the conclusion of each project, grant recipients prepare a case study to describe the projects approach and results, identify next steps and needs, share lessons learned and applicability for other municipalities and help identify municipal and regional needs and emerging coastal issues. The case studies focus on sharing lessons learned \"in their own words\" on the webpage: [https://www.maine.gov/dacf/municipalplanning/casestudies/ccg-case-studies.shtml.](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/municipalplanning/casestudies/ccg-case-studies.shtml.) Make Wise Firewood Choices September 24, 2019 The Maine Forest Service, reminds Mainers and visitors to use only local and heat-treated firewood. Why? Because it is the smart thing to do and there are legal restrictions on the movement of some firewood. Untreated firewood from out-of-state is banned (www.maine.gov/firewood) and moving hardwood firewood from within Maine's emerald ash borer quarantine areas is strictly prohibited- quarantined areas includes all of York County and the northern tip of Aroostook County (www.maine.gov/eab). \"When people move firewood they often think their firewood is harmless or that the cost of wood is too high where they are going. However, they can unwittingly carry destructive insects and diseases with them that are far costlier,\" said State Entomologist Allison Kanoti, These pests cause devastation in the forest which can ruin the beauty and bounty of the Maine forest that people come to enjoy. Autumn is here, and cold weather will quickly catch up. For many, fall is the favorite season and cooler temperatures do not stop us from getting outside. With hard frosts, biting flies will abate and hardwoods will be ablaze with color, making time outside even more enjoyable. Colder nights will make firewood a more frequent accessory to overnight and outdoor pursuits. Whether it is a fire to drive the chill out of camp or to warm up an evening outside, firewood should come from a local source or be heat-treated. The fact is that firewood from distant sources has moved Asian longhorned beetle, emerald ash borer, oak wilt, southern pine beetle, brown spruce longhorned beetle and a host of other forest pests to new locales. Sources of treated or local firewood can be found online at firewood scout [http://firewoodscout.org/s/ME/.](http://firewoodscout.org/s/ME/.)

The company is asking to have its lands returned to a General Management (M-GN) Subdistrict and resource protection subdistricts. In a cover letter, the company cites the economy as the reason for its decision: \"The impact of the 2008-2009 recession forever changed the United States development landscape. As a result, and despite our best efforts, the development components under the Concept Plan have not been implemented and no development has occurred.\" In the filing, Weyerhaeuser emphasizes the Concept Plan's benefits to the Moosehead Lake Region, including conservation and trail easements, which are permanent and will not change because of the petition. They include: 363,000-acres of Weyerhauser land protected with the permanent Moosehead Region Conservation Easement; the 29,500-acre Roaches Pond Tract Conservation Easement; a 25-acre donation to Coastal Enterprises for affordable housing; 121-acres of permanent hiking trail easement, plus 50-acre land donation for trailheads with easements to access the trails; and the 81-mile permanent easement for snowmobile trails of the Interconnected Trail System. LUPC Commissioners are scheduled to gather at a regular monthly meeting on Wednesday, October 9, 2019, in Greenville. The meeting agenda will include a preliminary discussion of options for engaging the local community in next steps, including possible regional planning. Weyerhauser has stated its support for such a decision. The community is invited to attend, meeting details will be posted on the [LUPC website](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/lupc/about/calendar/index.shtml). The Moosehead Lake Region Concept Plan was approved by the LUPC in 2009, after years of hearings and deliberations. The Maine Supreme Court subsequently upheld the approval in a 2012 decision. About M-GN Subdistricts and resource protection subdistricts Management subdistricts are applied to areas that are appropriate for commercial forest product or agricultural uses and for which future development is not anticipated. In Maine, the M-GN Subdistrict is the most significant subdistrict in terms of size. The purpose of the M-GN Subdistrict is to permit forestry and agricultural management activities to occur with minimal interference from unrelated development. Resource protection subdistricts are established to protect resources like lakes, streams, wildlife and plant habitat, floodplains, and other sensitive areas.

UMaine Cooperative Extension made the discovery and this is the first confirmed find of Swede midge in the state. Swede midge is a serious insect pest of cruciferous plants, such as cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli. The small larvae feed on the growing tips of plants and disfigure or prevent head formation. Earlier in August, University of Maine Extension entomologists received reports of broccoli damage in Franklin and Aroostook counties. Inspection of damaged plants yielded small maggot-like larvae. Pheromone traps were put in place and adult specimens were collected within a week. Officials at the Maine DACF prepared the specimens for shipment to USDA National Identifiers, who confirmed the species in early September. About Swede Midge Swede midge is native to Europe and southwest Asia. The first North American find was in Ontario Canada in 2000, and was subsequently found in Niagara County, NY in 2004. Maine is the last of the six New England states to report swede midge. Maine's Cooperative Agricultural Pest Survey (CAPS) program surveyed for swede midge from 2003 and 2007, and again in 2018, with no positive finds. Swede midge larvae cause significant crop losses from the following damage: broccoli failing to produce heads; scarring on cauliflower petioles; absent Brussels sprouts; multiple heading of cabbage and contorted leaves of kale. Control of Swede midge is difficult, especially in organic growing systems.

Supporting documents Harvest of the Month - Local Food for Local Schools October 17, 2019 The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) celebrates the official launch of Maine's Harvest of the Month (HOM) Program. Harvest of the Month is a program of the Maine Department of Education (DOE), Child Nutrition Program, and was piloted in schools in Spring 2019 with participation from over 165 schools state-wide. The full rollout of the program began this fall for the 2019-2020 school year. Program Background Harvest of the Month is a nationwide marketing campaign promoting the use of seasonally available, local products in schools, institutions, and communities. Each month, a different local product is highlighted and participating entities pledge to serve the product and promote it through educational materials and activities. The program launched in California and has been replicated by dozens of other states across the country. With Maines participation, all New England states now have Harvest of the Month programs. Farmers and Local Producers One of the major goals of the Maine HOM program is to support Maine farmers and producers, and therefore Maines local economy. To help School Food Service Directors successfully source each months product, a list of participating producers has been created to help them connect with local farmers, providers, and distributors. Farmers and producers who provide HOM products to schools have the chance to be highlighted on the DOE website, HOM social media, etc. We would like to add more producers to the list for School Year 2020! School Food Service Participating School Food Service Directors are asked to take a pledge to serve the monthly HOM product at least two times per month in their cafeterias. In addition to this, they pledge to display HOM promotional materials, such as posters, fun facts, and stickers for students who have tried the HOM product. Featured recipes are also provided each month. They also agree to participate in evaluations so that local produce procurement can be tracked and to analyze the success of the program. Local products may be sourced directly from farms, farmer cooperatives, and distributors. When buying produce directly from a farm or farmer cooperative, School Food Service Directors may take advantage of the Local Produce Fund, which reimburses $1 for every $3 spent on local produce. Agriculture and Education in Partnership The Maine Department of Education and Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry have been exploring more ways to connect farmers and food producers with their local school districts. \"School food service programs and local farms can go hand and hand, which is why the DACFs Bureau of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Resources is pleased to collaborate with DOEs Harvest of the Month program,\" according to Nancy McBrady, Director of the Bureau of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Resources. This program allows participating schools to purchase local, nutritious foods which helps boost farm incomes while educating students about local agriculture. The program directly links School Food Service Directors with participating farmers and producers in their community and the Bureau is thrilled that the Local Produce Fund can assist School Food Service Directors in ordering even more local produce. The Bureau encourages local producers to sign up to be a Harvest of the Month source for schools today!

Officials with the USDA Animal and Plant Health and Inspection Service (APHIS) have confirmed the identification of an adult beetle found on a trap in Portland, Maine. An initial look by City and Department staff did not reveal additional signs of the insect. Further surveys are planned during the insect's dormant period. Emerald ash borer was discovered in northern Aroostook County in May 2018 and later in York County in September 2018. The State of Maine established a quarantine to regulate the movement of ash trees, ash wood, and all hardwood firewood to slow the spread of this very destructive pest. The Maine Forest Service will issue a stop movement order on the same materials from Portland and towns within a 10-mile buffer, including: Cape Elizabeth, Chebeague Island, Cumberland, Falmouth, Gorham, Island, Yarmouth, Portland, Scarborough, South Portland, Westbrook, Windham, and Yarmouth. The new find is likely the result of firewood transport into the area, since the closest known infestation is over 40 miles away in Lebanon. On their own, the beetles only travel to 2 miles a year. The City of Portland, known as the \"Forest City,\" has had an active urban and community forestry program for over 100 years and has already done much work to prepare for this destructive pest and other forest threats. The City maintains an inventory of all public shade and street trees. There are just over 600 individual ash trees planted along city streets and public parks. There are also many native ash trees in the forests and pockets of woods that skirt the city, especially along waterways such as the Presumpscot River. The city plans to monitor for expansion of the infestation with the Maine DACF and local conservation groups and will prioritize treatment and removal of infested ash. Emerald ash borer was first discovered in the Detroit, Michigan area in 2002, though it is believed to have arrived in the 1990s. The beetle is about one half an inch and metallic green. Its larvae tunnel through the wood just under the bark of ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) and can kill even healthy trees in 4-5 years. Tens of millions of trees across the country have been killed. Ash trees comprise 4% of Maines forest and are an important street and shade tree. Emerald ash borer threatens all species of ash trees (but not mountain-ash) and can have significant ecological and economic impacts. There are no practical means to control EAB in forested areas, although pesticide treatments can protect individual trees. Biological control, in the form of tiny, non-stinging wasps that attack EAB, has been started in Maine with releases in forested areas in the Madawaska area. In urban and residential areas, high-value trees can be protected using insecticides. This approach is recommended only after EAB has been found within 10 miles of the trees in question. Staff from the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry and the City of Portland will be on hand to answer questions at Payson Park at the corner of Fernald Street and Payson Park Roadway (Catafalque Drive) in Portland on Monday, October 21st at 1 PM.

If you are involved in storm cleanup, please be safe and also help keep Maine's forests healthy. The woody debris created by storm damage may harbor insects or diseases that are harmful to our forests. Moving that debris long distances can spread pests to new areas. Be aware that there are rules, known as quarantines, that impact transport of some woody storm debris: - Movement of ash (Fraxinus) from areas within the Emerald Ash Borer regulated area. The restriction in this case extends to mixed hardwood chips. - Movement of Larch (Larix spp, Pseudolarix spp.) from areas within the Canker quarantine. - Movement of Hemlock (Tsuga) branch/top material from areas within the Hemlock Woolly Adelgid quarantine. - Movement of Pine (Pinus spp.) from parts of Maine within the Pine Shoot Beetle quarantine to Washington and Aroostook Counties.

After power and other utilities have been restored, property owners will be faced with the issue of what to do with storm-damaged trees. Project Canopy, a program of the Maine Forest Service (MFS), offers tips and helpful guidance to property owners faced with questions about what to do with downed trees, limbs, and branches. - Trees and branches on homes and around power lines- Homeowners need to find immediate solutions for trees and branches on their homes. Branches and trees on power lines should be dealt with by calling local power companies. Even if a hanging limb is clear of power and utility wires, homeowners should rely on professionals to assess the severity of the damage before trying to repair or remove the branch. - Injured trees requiring climbing or chainsaw work Call a licensed arborist for help. Arborists are tree care professionals who are trained to assess and correct storm-damaged trees. They also have the experience needed to diagnose how much of a tree can or should be saved. Homeowners should be wary of those offering fly-by-night, emergency tree-cutting services. Always ask for proof of licensing, insurance and work references. - Trees covered with ice As we head into colder months, ice and snow loads can further damage leaning trees or branches not broken free and can make a potentially dangerous situation even more so. Do not work around limbs that have broken off (or partially broken off) and are hung up in a tree crown. These can break off at any time with devastating force. Contact a licensed and insured arborist.

Bunker was selected because of his outstanding contributions to preserving Maine's historic apple heritage. The award has been presented annually for the past 18 years and acknowledges significant contributions to Maine agriculture. \"John's years of identifying and cataloging the vast diversity of apple varieties that exist in the state of Maine has resulted in the preservation of an amazing array of characteristics, from tree hardiness and fruit storage-ability, to colors and flavors that go far beyond what we experience from the few varieties of apples we are used to buying in the grocery store,\" said Beal. \"The living genetic bank created by these hundreds of different apple varieties that exist on Johns farm in Palermo, at the Maine Heritage Orchard, and in backyards and on farms throughout Maine thanks to his work at Fedco Trees and now at the Blaine House is a real gift to us all, and will be so for future generations to come.\" Shortly after Governor Mills took office in early 2019, Bunker reached out to her administration with an offer to install a heritage apple orchard at the Blaine House, with varieties that represent all 16 counties; this idea is now well on its way to being a reality. Bunker is also credited with installing the Maine Heritage Orchard at a rehabilitated gravel pit adjacent to the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardener's Common Ground Education Center, in Unity. The intent of the orchard is to provide a home for more than 500 heritage apple and pear varieties. Text of the plaque presented to John Bunker As Maines own Apple Whisperer, you have cultivated numerous varieties of rare and historic apples at Super Chilly Farm, founded the Maine Heritage Orchard, and installed a heritage apple orchard at the Blaine House with varieties from all 16 counties. Your leadership and dedication as a farmer, historian, and educator is truly commendable. About John Bunker John Bunker is a farmer, author, artist, historian, educator, and mentor to many aspiring and established apple growers, and both home and professional cider makers. Over the years he has tried his hand at many different ventures. Yet none of these things grabbed his attention like the old apple trees growing in the fields around Palermo. As he picked the fruits from these neglected trees each fall, he noticed the differences in the apples - to his surprise they were not all Macs. Through seasons of observation and hours of discussions with the old-timers around town, he learned to identify the different varieties and appreciate their stories. His interest grew into a passion that became his life's work. In 1984 John started Fedco Trees ostensibly to encourage others to plant trees, but really it was a way to fund his insatiable habit of tracking down heirloom fruit varieties in all corners of Maine.

The award was presented to Andrew Reed, MACD President and Carol Weymouth, MACD Executive Director. \"Our forests have always been -- and will always be -- at the core of Maine's history and our future,\" said Governor Mills. \"Congratulations to the Maine Association of Conservation Districts on this well-deserved honor and on behalf of the people of Maine, thank you for all you do for our great state.\" ABOUT AUSTIN WILKINS Austin Wilkins pioneered the development of the Maine Forest Service and led the fight against the devastating forest fires of 1947. The fires that scorched the landscape in Bar Harbor and southern Maine's York County prompted Mr. Wilkins to develop policies to reduce the chances that such conflagrations could occur again. He was instrumental in the establishment of a forest fire compact that called for the six New England states, New York, New Brunswick, and Quebec to provide mutual help in battling fires. He joined the Maine Forest Service in 1928 and was appointed commissioner 30 years later by Governor Edmund Muskie. Mr. Wilkins retired in 1972 after serving under 13 governors as a commissioner or a deputy commissioner. Governor John Baldacci called Mr. Wilkins a ''true leader and one of the forestry greats of Maine\" and praised ''his quiet and thorough approach and his eloquent speaking.\" Mr. Wilkins was the author of ''Ten Million Acres of Timber,\" a history of the Maine forestry district, as well as a book about the Civilian Conservation Corps. He remained active in forestry matters well into his 90s. He died in 2005 at the age of 102. ABOUT MACD MACD represents Maines 16 Soil & Water Conservation Districts. Soil & Water Conservation Districts are agencies of the state that provide voluntary technical assistance to landowners on the local level. Conservation Districts were created by Maine and other states as a response to the massive loss of topsoil in the \"Dust Bowl\" of the 1930s. Locally-led soil & water conservation programs have been a cost-effective response to soil erosion, non-point source pollution of lakes, rivers, and marine waters, and now, to the vital issue of mitigating climate change through better soil health practices and sustainable forest management. Forest management is a high priority for every Conservation District. Many offer annual tree and shrub sales to encourage property owners to plant more native vegetation. Several Districts provide portable skidder bridges (with assistance from the Maine Forest Service) that allow loggers to cross wet areas without damage. Many Conservation Districts have active or retired foresters on their Boards of Supervisors.

Wreath and Tree Shippers Should Be Aware of Out-of-State Plant Regulations November 5, 2019 For more information contact: Gary Fish at: 207-287-7545 AUGUSTA -Maine residents and businesses sending trees, wreaths, or other decorative plant material around the country this holiday season can save money and prevent product loss by noting important plant health regulations enforced by other states, according to the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF). \"Shippers should be aware of the many state laws and regulations regarding the movement of plants and forest products,\" warned Gary Fish, State Horticulturist. Many states closely monitor shipments to prevent introduction of invasive insects and plant diseases. By planning ahead, Maine shippers can speed up deliveries in this time-sensitive industry, said Fish. This year, changes to the federal gypsy moth program may present a challenge to shippers in northern Maine who were previously not required to comply with gypsy moth regulations.Gypsy moth egg masses (see photo below) can be found on a wide range of outdoor items including Christmas trees. Christmas tree growers that ship trees outside the gypsy moth quarantine area (see map) must have a compliance agreement with USDA-Plant Protection and Quarantine and inspect their trees for egg masses before shipment.Wreaths and other holiday decorations assembled with branches that are less than inch in diameter do not require a compliance agreement; however, they do need to be inspected. Contact the Maine USDA-PPQ office at 207-848-0000 to set up an inspection or inquire about compliance agreements. Advice for wreath and tree shippers: - Import regulations can vary from state to state; shippers should check destination state regulations before sending plant material. Find contact information for the destination state at nationalplantboard.org/membership - Carefully inspect plant material before packaging, especially shipments headed to California, to make sure they are free of insects such as scales, egg masses or other pest damage. - Clearly label packages containing holiday plant material, beginning with the statement, Grown in Maine, followed by the county of origin and the name and address of the shipper. - Labels should also indicate the contents of packages, including the different types of greenery, nuts, fruits and cones used to decorate wreaths. Import requirements for cut trees and holiday decorations including greenery, ornamental nuts and fruit exist to protect regional agriculture and natural resources from the risk of plant pests, Fish explained. An insect or plant disease that occurs in Maine could potentially be invasive in other states. Unfortunately, despite the quality of Maine products, some shippers have learned about these regulations the hard way and have had shipments delayed, impounded or destroyed. We want to prevent any losses by getting the word out now, said Fish. An informational sheet, Know State Regulations When shipping Wreaths and Trees, is available on the web at [http://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/horticulture/wreaths.shtml.](http://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/horticulture/wreaths.shtml.)

Browntail caterpillars cause a poison ivy-like rash and they are impacting a broad swath of Maine. Contact with this caterpillar's hairs can cause severe reactions for some individuals. Browntail caterpillars spend the winter webbed in silken wrapped leaves on the tips of hardwood branches, especially oak and fruit trees. Now through mid-April is when to look for the bright white silk tying a few leaves to the tips of oak and fruit tree branches. If you see a web, clip it out and destroy it by dropping it in a bucket of soapy water and soaking it overnight; do not leave it on the ground. The caterpillars become active as soon as warmer weather arrives, so do this task as soon as possible. It is also important to clip webs before mid-April because of the increased risk of toxic hair exposure. Browntail caterpillar webs are found in Maine from the New Hampshire border to Deer Isle, and inland to Raymond, Turner, Rome, Smithfield, Burnham and Eddington. The moths have been seen as far west to Kingfield, north to Ashland and east to Topsfield, on the New Brunswick border. For more than 100 years, Maine people have known that \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\" when it comes to browntail moths. Learn how to recognize browntail moth webs by visiting the websites below, then go and check your trees for their presence. If you find them and can reach them, clip and destroy them. If they are out of reach, now is the time to call and schedule professional help. Survey a public space in your town: If you think you have found webs, but are not sure, contact the Maine Forest Service for help. Additional advice may be obtained from your nearest [Cooperative Extension office](https://extension.umaine.edu/) or [Soil & Water Conservation District](https://maineconservationdistricts.com/district-locations/).

The comments come after a thorough analysis by state officials and include feedback from Maine farmers. The USDA's proposed hemp regulations were released Oct. 29, 2019, and states were invited to review and respond with comments within 60-days. \"The requirements proposed by the interim rule have the potential to be detrimental to Maine farmers who have invested in hemp production, as well as those who are planning to enter this emerging hemp industry,\" commented Amanda Beal, DACF Commissioner. We strongly encourage the USDA to ensure that the final rules are practical and dont hamper the future growth of hemp production and its potential contribution to Maines economy. Maines hemp program launched in 2016 with one grower, and today 181 licensed hemp farmers are growing hemp in all of Maines 16 counties, and crop varieties are thriving. We urge the USDA to deliver a flexible Domestic Hemp Production Program rule that takes into consideration the complexities of hemp production, commented Nancy McBrady, Director, Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources. Maine farmers have spoken, and we agree, that the rules proposed by the USDA are overly burdensome, and we are hopeful that changes will be made that reflect the needs of hemp farmers.

Ann Gibbs, Director of Animal and Plant Health, Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources, on the United States Department of Agricultures (USDA) Interim Final Hemp Rule: USDA Agricultural Marketing Service Doc. No. AMS-SC-19-0042 SC19-990-2 I. Via Email Re: State of Maine Comments on USDA Interim Final Hemp Rules Dear Sir/Madam: The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry thanks you for the opportunity to comment on the USDA AMS interim final rule, 7 CFR Part 990 Establishment of a Domestic Hemp Production Program (Rule). Maine has had a hemp program in place since 2016, beginning with one grower who harvested seed from less than an acre. This has since grown to 181 license agreements and over 2000 acres of planted hemp in 2019. Hemp is now grown in every one of Maines 16 counties, and the varieties grown are thriving in all parts of the state. There has been a lot of support for and interest in this new crop by producers, private industry, the state legislature, and the Department. However, we are concerned that the requirements proposed by the Rules will require some major adjustments to the program that could adversely affect the growth of this industry in Maine. Below are our comments regarding how these proposed changes will impact the Maine program. LABS The Rules require that testing labs be registered with DEA. This may be cumbersome at best and impossible to meet at worst. In 2019, the Maine program switched to using one available private testing lab, which is not currently registered with DEA, because our state lab was unable to process samples. The private lab is ISO 17025 accredited, which is an important accreditation because it requires third-party assessors to evaluate the laboratorys ability to produce precise, accurate test and calibration data, and facilities are regularly reassessed to ensure technical expertise is maintained. ISO 17025 accreditation is more important to the state than DEA registration. It is also unclear how many labs in Maine will seek DEA registration for hemp, or if they will even be available to test hemp samples. Maine just approved and is implementing a recreational marijuana program, and with the new push to find labs to test marijuana, labs may choose to focus on this crop and not hemp. Hemp testing labs will also need a DEA approved plan for disposal of non-compliant hemp, and those requirements are not clear at this time. THC LEVELS DACF is concerned that the USDAs requirement for a 0.3% Total THC level with no provision for mitigation does not allow for enough flexibility given the realities of the crop. This is not practical: many hemp cultivars are unstable and may fluctuate in THC content depending on soil type, climate, weather, pest infestations, or other plant stress factors. Since the sampling procedures are worst case based and do not include plant material from the entire plant, non-compliant test results should be allowed to be mitigated. The 2018 Farm Bill under Section 297B e(2)(B) Corrective Action Plan appears to allow the state to develop corrective actions when a growers hemp is found to be above 0.3% Total THC. The states corrective action plan should be allowed to include grower requirements to extract from or process the entire plant as biomass when total THC levels are above 0.3% and below 0.5%. (Note that, ideally, Maine would prefer that the upper limit be 1% Total THC because the risk of anyone using that cannabis for the marijuana market is virtually non-existent.) Additionally, the extractor or processor could be required to assure the THC level of any product produced is diluted below the 0.3% threshold, and if any excess THC isolate exists, that it is properly disposed. Currently, Maine law only requires hemp to be less than 0.3% delta 9 THC (not Total THC). Many of the CBD varieties currently grown will not meet USDAs new total THC threshold. If the USDA retains the 0.3% Total THC level with no allowance for flexibility, the likely outcome for growers would be significant lost investments and diminished market prospects for what limited varieties will qualify as hemp using this limit. The industrys growth prospects could be significantly reduced. We urge the USDA to allow for greater, yet manageable, flexibility in determining THC levels that can qualify as hemp with or without additional mitigation. Another direction the USDA could take on defining what qualifies as hemp is to use taxonomic determination based on the genetic testing of known cannabinoid ratios of stable cultivars. Type III cultivars that are CBD dominant with a ratio of at least 20:1 CBD to THC are not psychoactive and produce high levels of CBD, which is one of the chief derivatives that hemp growers seek. SAMPLING Under the new Rules, the state will be required to sample every field and every area that has a different variety/strain growing, which will substantially increase the number of samples required to be collected. We believe that this is impractical. DACF currently collects one sample per license agreement, and some of our licensees have 15 20 different grow sites. This year there were 217 grow sites on 182 license agreements and multiple varieties grown on more than half of those sites. Had the new Rules been in effect for 2019, the number of THC samples would have increased from 182 samples to 300 or more. An additional complication for sampling is the requirement for the licensee or a designated employee to accompany the sampling agent throughout the sampling process. This requirement, along with the increased number of samples, will make the states sampling of all hemp lots within 15 days of harvest very difficult. Both of these added burdens will require additional FTEs to complete the sampling within the 15-day timeframe. REGISTRATION The Rules will require hemp farms to register with the USDA Farm Service Agency (FSA). While we understand that the potential benefit to growers for registering is possible financial assistance from FSA under certain future circumstances, we believe it could also be a significant barrier for small, less experienced growers who comprise the bulk of our licensees. Registration with FSA could discourage growers from becoming licensed because many of them are also medical marijuana growers and would not be favorable to registering their land with a federal agency. The state hemp program depends upon license fees to support the regulatory program. If too many growers are discouraged by this requirement, the program may not be self-sustaining. BACKGROUND CHECKS The requirement for background checks to exclude applicants with a felony in the last 10 years will be a significant change to the Maine program, which does not require such checks. Maines original state statues included a requirement for background checks, which were later deleted in the 2015 laws. This requirement will add another barrier for hemp growers who will be facing numerous new registration and reporting requirements under the Rules. Maine also has a statutory conflict with this requirement. 5 MRS Chapter 341 5303(1) only allows our agency to disqualify an individual from licensing on the basis of a criminal record for a maximum period of three years. REPORTING The Rules monthly reporting requirements to the USDA AMS are extensive and will impose burdens on the state to implement. The state will have to develop a more sophisticated and costly database in order to fulfill these requirements. Further, because one of the monthly reports requires submission of geospatial location data, the state will have to amend the current licensing statutes that protect locations of hemp production sites as confidential information. The new reports will also require our current testing lab to change their report format and develop a process to notify the grower as well as the state of the total THC test results for each crop lot. Finally, the Rule requires use of a special license numbering system. Implementation of the new numbering scheme is an additional burden. All of these data and reporting requirements will increase the program workload and require additional state expenses. DISPOSAL Currently, when non-compliant hemp is found in Maine, the Department notifies local law enforcement and then the Department oversees grower destruction of the crop. The USDAs Rule changes this process so that if non-compliant hemp is found, the DEA or another entity authorized to handle marijuana under the Controlled Substance Act will dictate the process for disposal. Recognizing the time and effort that may be asked of these entities in disposal situations, the Department advocates that options for destruction include simple solutions such as mowing, disking-in the crop, or composting. IMPLEMENTATION DATE The Department is concerned that the USDAs approved plan implementation deadline of October 31, 2020, will seriously disrupt Maine and other states current licensing schemes, to the detriment of growers. If growers state licenses are void after that date, it could create a barrier for the licensee to sell their 2020 crop. For instance, if hemp is harvested prior to October 31, 2020, and was tested under the states 0.3% delta 9 THC method, will that hemp no longer be allowed to be sold on or after October 31st? Further, due to the Rules requirement that currently confidential grower data be reported to the USDA, the Maine legislature will need to make statutory changes to current Maine law. Given the states legislative calendar, this may be impossible to achieve by that timeframe. We urge the USDA to rethink this deadline or provide for extended implementation dates, should states face legislative hurdles to comply. An alternative option would be to continue to operate state programs and gradually phase into the Federal program as milestones are achieved to comply with the Rule. FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND AGENCIES The Department is hopeful that these rules will establish a firm basis for Land Grant Universities to pursue hemp research without any threat of federal grant disqualification. The University of Maines risk management department has not allowed university staff to conduct any research that requires handling of cannabis of any form. We also are supportive of providing hemp growers access to the USDA-FSA cost-share funding and the USDA-NRCS programs. The Department would support allowing new hemp farmers to access that funding and those programs even earlier than the current rules allow. SUMMARY The Department hopes these comments are instructive as the USDA determines how to move forward with implementing the Federal hemp program. As presented, these Rules will be challenging to implement for states with existing hemp programs and could threaten the future growth of the industry overall. The years of hands-on and practical experience that Maine, along with numerous other states, has had operating its hemp program should inform the USDA on how these Rules should be amended.

DACF unveiled a modernized logo that aligns with the Department's updated strategic vision for the branding program. The logo unveiling and announcement come as thousands of agricultural producers, suppliers, and educators gather for DACFs 79th Maine Agricultural Trades Show. The new Real Maine logo is the foundation of an increased marketing and advertising initiative led by DACF to generate broader awareness and interest in Maine agricultural products. Todays unveiling includes a Real Maine logo that broadly represents all aspects of Maine agriculture. Real Maine will help promote Maine-grown and produced products and the farmers and value-added processors who grow and make them. \"We are hearing it more than ever that people are demanding more Maine-grown and made products. The word Maine\" is synonymous with high-quality and integrity, said Amanda Beal, Commissioner at DACF. The goal for Real Maine is to provide a fresh logo and a smart marketing and communications campaign that opens more doors for Maine agriculture. We believe this will help galvanize more local, regional, and national demand for our agricultural products. Since 2001, DACFs prior get real. get Maine! branding program helped Maine-based agricultural businesses market their products directly to consumers. After extensive research into the needs of large and small producers, the DACF team is implementing its new and scalable Real Maine campaign with the goal of increasing consumer awareness and purchases, both within and outside the state, of Maine agricultural products. Director of the Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources, Nancy McBrady said, Our agricultural community voiced the need for an updated promotional campaign, and we listened. We are excited about the momentum the refreshed look will create. DACF's Real Maine logo will be recognizable in farmers markets and grocery stores, at agricultural events and trade shows, throughout Maine, New England, and nationally. In addition, an updated Real Maine website will be introduced during spring 2020, along with a comprehensive promotional strategy. WHATS NEW Inspired by passport stamps, which travelers accumulate on adventures, the Real Maine logo is a symbol representative of how people can explore, experience and connect through the range of agricultural products that are produced in Maine. To meet branding needs for different markets or package designs, there are multiple iterations of the logo that can be utilized, including one with a specialized tagline for those marketing to consumers within Maine. Together, these core branding elements exemplify the values and commitment to excellence of Maine agricultural producers.

Supporting documents Bickford earns 2020 DACF Commissioner's Distinguished Service Award January 16, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 287-3156 AUGUSTA - Longtime Maine Dairy Industry Association (MDIA) Executive Director, Julie-Marie Bickford, is the recipient of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) 2020 Commissioner's Distinguished Service Award. A Topsham resident, Bickford received the award at Tuesday's Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioners Luncheon, held during the opening day of the 79th annual Maine Agricultural Trades Show. Amanda Beal, DACF Commissioner, presented the award and recognized Bickford in front of an audience including Governor Janet Mills, representatives of all four Congressional offices, state legislators, past DACF Commissioners, and over 300 friends of Maine agriculture. \"Our dairy industry would not be what it is today without Julie-Marie's guidance and innumerable hours of devotion,\" said Beal. From playing a key role in establishing the Maine Dairy Stabilization Program (also known as the Tier program), to advocating on the federal level to improve the Federal Order pricing system, to just being there and being a voice for our dairy farmers, whenever and wherever shes needed, Julie-Maries contributions are many.\" The Commissioners Distinguished Service Award is presented annually to individuals making significant contributions to Maine's agricultural industry. Bickford was selected because of her nearly 20 years of advocating for our dairy industry and her constant and steady support of agriculture in Maine. Bickford grew up in Northern Maine in an active agricultural community whose dominant crops were potatoes, broccoli, and grains. Though she didnt grow up on a farm, she will assure you that you cant be from the County and not have a good understanding of agriculture. From hand-picking potatoes, to scooping Houlton Farms ice cream, Bickford learned the value of hard work and the importance of supporting local farmers. She was elected to the Maine Legislature in 1992, representing her hometown of Caribou, and served two terms in the House of Representatives. She later served as a State Office Assistant to US Senator William Cohen and then US Senator Olympia Snowe. These, and other experiences, positioned Bickford to be a powerful advocate for Maines dairy farmers when she stepped into the role with MDIA, first as a consultant, and later as Executive Director. MDIA has seen significant growth in both the scope and magnitude of activities and participation in the Maine agricultural and governmental communities since first hiring Bickford. In addition, she is active in monitoring and being a resource to numerous agencies and commissions, and also represents MDIA on the University of Maines Board of Agriculture and AgCOM, where she is currently serving as President.

Individuals who purchased deli items, ready-to-eat food, or meat from Josephs Market in Waterville between those dates should watch for symptoms and contact a health care provider to be tested if they show any signs of infection. Deli and ready-to eat-food purchased between December 27, 2019, and January 9, 2020, should be discarded. Meat purchased between those dates should either be discarded or cooked thoroughly. Individuals who ate deli items, ready-to-eat food, or meat purchased between these dates have up to 14 days after eating it to receive Hepatitis A immune globulin (IG) or the vaccine. Contact your medical provider to discuss options. Individuals with compromised immune systems or children under one year old who ate deli items, ready-to-eat food, or meat from Josephs Market during this time could gain added protection by receiving the hepatitis A IG, upon consultation with their health care providers. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable, contagious liver disease that is caused by the hepatitis A virus. Symptoms can range from mild illness to a severe sickness that requires hospitalization and can last several months. Most adults with hepatitis A have a sudden onset of symptoms such as tiredness, low appetite, stomach pain, nausea, dark urine and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Most children younger than 6 years old do not have symptoms or have an unrecognized infection. The best way to prevent hepatitis A infection is to get vaccinated. Hepatitis A can be spread through contaminated food or water, especially in food prepared by a person who is infected. Symptoms will begin to show 15-50 days after exposure to the virus. An infected person can spread the virus to others approximately two weeks before symptoms start until one week after symptoms end. Maine DACF and CDC are working with the business owner and local health care providers to minimize risk of further exposures.

Chase, LLC, for proposed underground metallic mineral mine January 27, 2020 AUGUSTA - The Land Use Planning Commission (LUPC) has received a zoning petition from Wolfden Mt. Chase, LLC, to rezone approximately 197.5 acres of land from a General Management Subdistrict to a Planned Development Subdistrict (D-PD) in T6 R6 WELS, near Mt. Chase, Northern Penobscot County. The proposed purpose of the D-PD subdistrict is for an underground metallic mineral mine and associated buildings and infrastructure. The zoning petition is subject to and will be reviewed under the Commission's [Chapter 12 rules](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/lupc/laws_rules/rule_chapters/Chapter12_ver2013.pdf). Chapter 12 requires a public hearing to be held by the Commission before a final decision on the petition. Wolfden Mt. Chase, LLC, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wolfden Resources Corporation. This is the first step in a multi-agency process to review the merits of this proposal. A copy of the petition and more information about the process is available for download from the project-specific webpage: [https://www.maine.gov/dacf/lupc/projects/wolfden/wolfden_rezoning.html](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/lupc/projects/wolfden/wolfden_rezoning.html) About the Planned Development Subdistrict (D-PD) A petitioner wishing to seek a metallic mineral mining permit from the Department of Environmental Protection under the Maine Metallic Mineral Mining Act ( [Title 38, chapter 3, subchapter 1, article 9](https://legislature.maine.gov/statutes/38/title38ch3sec0.html)) for a project located wholly or in part within the unorganized areas of the State must first petition and receive approval from the Commission for a change in subdistrict boundary to a custom, Planned Development (D-PD) Subdistrict. The D-PD subdistrict is the only Commission zoning subdistrict that would allow for metallic mineral mining. The purpose of the D-PD subdistrict is to allow for large scale, well-planned development that depends on a particular natural feature or location that is available at the proposed site. About the LUPC The Maine Legislature created the LUPC to extend principles of sound planning, zoning, and development to the unorganized and deorganized areas of the State, including townships and plantations. These areas either have no local government or have chosen not to administer land use controls at the local level.

DACF Indoor and Outdoor Hemp License Applications are available on the Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources [website](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/hemp/), and are due at least 30 days before the anticipated date of planting. Two proposed rule changes not implemented were an increase in the outdoor license acreage fee from $50 to $100/acre and using 0.3 % total THC content instead of delta9-THC only as the defining line between hemp and marijuana. The Department listened to growers and others during the public comment period of the rulemaking process. The message was clear; 2020 is not the year to increase fees. The outdoor license acreage fee will remain at $50/acre. Public feedback was also overwhelmingly in favor of keeping the definition of hemp as a Cannabis sativa L. plant that contains not more than 0.3% delta-9-THC only. Maine will continue to use the 0.3 % delta-9-THC only measurement at least through October 31, 2020, when a USDA-approved program will have to begin. Three other proposed changes were included in the final rule. The first is unlimited licenses for indoor hemp. The fee for an indoor license will be $500.00 plus $0.25 per square foot of growing area. Being able to grow hemp crops in greenhouses and other indoor structures year-round is an option many Maine farmers have wanted since hemp growing became legal in Maine in 2016. Another change that did get implemented was a rolling application process. Instead of only being able to apply during the January 1 - April 1 window, applications will be accepted year-round. No longer will all licenses expire at the end of the calendar year; hemp licenses will expire 365 days after the date of issue. When to apply is up to the grower but should be at least 30 days before their anticipated planting date. The third change that remains in the final rule is the $20,000 cap on licensing agreement fees for either indoor or outdoor licenses separately.

AUGUSTA - Maine's natural resources agencies are inviting everyone who cares for our environment to get involved in National Invasive Species Awareness Week (NISAW), February 24-28, 2020. NISAW is a nationwide event designed to raise awareness of invasive species. In Maine, invasive species are already impacting our lakes, rivers, wetlands, forests, and ocean, and they are taking a toll on our natural resources economy. \"Our State Parks and Public Lands, our farms, forests, and water bodies are all being damaged by invasive species,\" commented Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"Everyone acknowledges that we can and should do more to help, and National Invasive Species Awareness Week is a perfect time to learn how to prevent and manage invasive species.\" Invasive pests, including emerald ash borer, browntail moth, multiflora rose, Asiatic bittersweet, milfoil, green crabs, and countless others, are harming Maine's unique natural resources, recreation and tourism economy, and the livelihood, traditions, and health of thousands of Maine people. Mainers are fortunate: most of our lakes and rivers are free from invasive aquatic plants but we need to be vigilant to stop new infestations,\" said Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Commissioner Jerry Reid. We urge users of Maines waters to clean debris from all boats and equipment, drain water from engines, boat bilges and live wells after use and dry anything that contacts water before moving to another lake or river. Recognizing that combating invasive species is in the best interest of all who live in and visit Maine, the states four natural resource agencies are encouraging everyone to participate in NISAW Part I, Monday, February 24 to Friday, February 24, 2020. NISAW Part II occurs May 16-23, 2020. Unauthorized introductions of fish and aquatic plants into Maines waters can create irreversible impacts and can alter ecosystems, forever, said Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (DIFW) Commissioner Judy Camuso. Maine is home to some wonderfully special (and fun to catch) native fishery resources and protecting what we have is a responsibility of everyone that enjoys Maines unique natural resources. Invasive species are those plants and animals, including insects and microbes, that are not native to Maine, and that cause harm to the environment, the economy, and human health. Maine, because of its unique natural resources and its status as the most forested state in the nation, is under threat from numerous invasive species. The health of Maines marine environment is critically important, and preventing the introduction of invasive species is a significant focus of ours, said Department of Marine Resources (DMR) Commissioner Patrick Keliher. Awareness around this issue is important and underscores the value of our work to safeguard commercially and ecologically valuable species through our inspection and permitting process for imported species, and our work to understand and support efforts to control invasive species like green crabs. Invasive Threats Of Maines nearly 6,000 lakes, fewer than one percent, fortunately, are known to be currently infested with invasive aquatic plants. These plants can hijack the habitat of native fisheries, flora, and fauna; degrade water quality; diminish property values, and reduce water recreation opportunities, including fishing, boating, and swimming. Eleven invasive aquatic plants are identified in Maine law as illegal to import, sell, and transport, with six already discovered in some of Maines lakes. DEP and DIFW spend more than $1 million annually fighting these invasive plants. Invasive terrestrial plants threaten Maines wild places and can harm working forests and productive farms. Plants such as glossy buckthorn steadily invade high-quality forests, crowd out native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers, and out-compete the next generation of trees. Along rivers and streams, Japanese knotweed forms dense stands that prevent colonization by native plants. Knotweed roots and shoots are carried downstream in floodwaters, spreading the problem to new locations. Maine prohibits the sale of thirty-three species of invasive plants, and over 100 species are listed on an Advisory List of invasive plants to help guide land managers. The Maine Natural Areas Program (MNAP) within DACF tracks invasive plant distribution and management using the online mapping tool iMapInvasives and encourages Mainers to work with their town conservation commission, local land trust, or garden club to spread the word about invasive plants and work together to remove them. For more information, visit the MNAP website or [http://www.iMapInvasives.org.](http://www.iMapInvasives.org.) Maines forest trees are under attack from multiple invasive forest insect pests, and the threat of new pests invading Maine is constant. Invasive insects such as emerald ash borer and hemlock woolly adelgid will forever change Maines forests as they spread and continue to kill trees throughout the state, while other invasive pests like browntail moth affect quality of life and human health. Other invasive insects like Asian longhorned beetle or diseases like oak wilt have similar potential to damage Maines forests if they arrive here. The Maine Forest Service has a strict out-of-state firewood ban to prevent devastating introductions like these and natural resource managers everywhere continue to encourage the use of local or heat treated firewood only. At DACF, the divisions of Forest Health & Monitoring and Animal and Plant Health, working together as Maine Bug Watch, continue to monitor and control invasive insects and diseases whenever possible. The illegal stocking of species like northern pike, black crappie, or largemouth bass can have the most significant and obvious impacts to Maines native fisheries, but sometimes the release of new fish species can occur for other reasons. Often these illegal acts are intentional, like when someone wants a certain species of sport fish in a lake close to their home. Unintentional introductions can happen as a result of negligence related to threats found in an anglers bait bucket. While the level of threat from this type of introduction may be less than that from the intentional establishment of large predatory species, impacts to native fish populations can occur. DIFW already limits the fish species that can legally be used as bait and prohibits the unauthorized importation of baitfish from outside the state as two strategies to reduce risk, but recently a third strategy was employed to increase awareness related to using live fish as bait. In January of 2020, DIFW changed fishing regulations in northern Maine to prohibit the use of live fish as bait under the general law and only allow fishing with live bait fish on certain waters (which are specifically listed in [Maines Open Water and Ice Fishing Laws](https://www.maine.gov/ifw/maine-outdoors-laws.html)). This change reinforces the importance of this regions abundant native and wild fishery resources and stresses the potential damage to those fisheries when baitfish are introduced where they dont belong. Top Five Actions Everyone Can Take Right Now to Prevent and Manage Invasive Species Look for woodpecker blonding on ash trees. This shallow flecking of the bark by woodpeckers is a common sign of an emerald ash borer (EAB) infested ash tree. When you think you see blonding, take the best quality photo (phone pictures are okay), note your location, and report the findings on our [EAB Report Form](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/EABreportFORM.shtml). Learn how to [identify invasive plants](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/features/invasive_plants/invasives_gallery.htm) that might be growing on your property. For help recognizing problem plants, consider ordering a copy of the Maine Natural Areas Programs [Maine Invasive Plant Field Guide](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/about/publications/mipfg.html). The guide has detailed photos and recommended control methods to help to reclaim the landscape. Another great way to increase invasive plant awareness is to volunteer with a [local land trust](https://www.mltn.org/trusts/) or a conservation commission, to help remove invasive plants on local public lands. Be on the lookout for the invasive [tree of heaven](https://www.agriculture.nh.gov/publications-forms/documents/tree-of-heaven.pdf), which is host to a new invasive insect threat, the [spotted lanternfly](https://www.agriculture.pa.gov/Plants_Land_Water/PlantIndustry/Entomology/spotted_lanternfly/SpottedLanternflyAlert/Pages/default.aspx).

Through the SCBG program, DACF anticipates awarding approximately $600,000 in funding in 2020. The Department's Agricultural Resource Development (ARD) division administers the program and is the point of contact for Maine applicants. Since 2006, the SCBG program has awarded over $6 million through the DACF to support the growing number of specialty crop producers who are selling into local and regional markets. The program provides federal funding to projects identified as critical at the local level. Each spring, the DACF accepts SCBG applications and evaluates proposals through a competitive process. The Department submits the recommended proposals to the USDA, and approved projects typically start in the fall. The USDA defines specialty crops as fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops, including floriculture. The full list of eligible products is available on [usda.gov](https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/scbgp/specialty-crop). Recent awards have supported research into new plant varieties, development of pest management strategies, technology innovations, school initiatives, marketing, and food safety projects. Past grants resulted in improved harvests of blueberries, potatoes, maple syrup, hops, honey, and other crops. Commodity groups, agricultural organizations, educational institutions, municipalities, producers, and state agencies may be eligible, and new projects are welcome. Projects should enhance the competitiveness of Maine-grown specialty crops, which includes a wide range of potential projects. According to Dr. Lily Calderwood, Extension Wild Blueberry Specialist Assistant Professor of Horticulture, SCBG funding is integral, \"Without this funding, it would be much more difficult to maintain a top-notch research-based education program.\" At University of Maine Cooperative Extension, SCBG funding in recent years supported integrated pest and crop management for Maine wild blueberry growers and processors. SCB grants are federally funded and administered in Maine by the DACF. Awards are for one year only. However, applicants may reapply for consideration for additional funding in subsequent years.

The changes are identical to those published for public comment in late-January. This announcement comes at an important time of year as we are quickly approaching EAB flight season. The flight period for EAB begins May 1, when adult beetles can begin emerging from infested trees or other ash products. The majority of new EAB infestations are the direct result of human-assisted movement. Many of them, a result of movement of infested firewood. EAB The EAB [quarantine area within Maine](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/index.shtml) has expanded due to new detections in southern Maine near and outside the boundaries of the previous quarantine area. The expansion is designed to capture the likely extent of the infested areas in southern Maine, given our knowledge of how quickly the insect spreads naturally. Major additions include the northern half of Cumberland County and the five southernmost towns in Oxford County. The complete area in Maine under quarantine for EAB now includes all of Cumberland and York Counties and parts of Aroostook and Oxford Counties. The quarantine rule bans movement of ash nursery stock from the quarantine area, and regulates the movement of hardwood firewood, hardwood chips, and ash products with bark, such as logs, pulp, and untreated ash lumber. For complete information about what can and cannot move freely from EAB regulated areas, access the Maps, Regulations & Quarantine Information section on: [http://www.maine.gov/eab](http://www.maine.gov/eab**) HWA The area [under quarantine in Maine](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/quarantine_information.html#hwa) due to HWA has increased to reflect detections in the forests of Midcoast Maine and ornamental trees in coastal Hancock County. Repeated detections in ornamental trees in coastal Hancock County are an important reason for the expansion, highlighting the role of landscaping activities in the human-assisted spread of this forest pest. The complete area under quarantine for HWA in Maine now includes all of Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc and York Counties and portions of Androscoggin, Cumberland, Hancock, Kennebec, and Waldo Counties. This quarantine continues to regulate rooted hemlock seedlings and nursery stock, hemlock branches and/or needles, chips containing branches and/or needles, and uncomposted bark containing branches and/or needles. Often over-looked, clusters of HWA appear as small cotton-ball like masses on the undersides of hemlock twigs. They can be easily identified when viewed up close. If you suspect you have seen HWA, mark the branch, take a picture or sample and contact the Maine Forest Service. Report suspected HWA online or call (207) 287-2431.

FFAP reimburses the purchase price of the EBT equipment as well as related costs. Funded by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service, FFAP reimbursements are available through September 2021, and applications are accepted [online](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RealMaineEBT). \"The goal of FFAP is to ensure more Mainers have access to local foods by increasing the number of farms and farmers' markets accepting SNAP benefits in Maine,\" according to Leigh Hallett, DACF Agricultural Resource Development Division Director. \"We know that farmers want to make their products available to shoppers who use SNAP benefits, but often the cost of equipment and fees is prohibitively expensive. This program will help more farmers get involved, so more communities will have SNAP access for local foods.\" The Maine Federation of Farmers Markets provides technical assistance and resources to farmers markets and also operates the [Maine Harvest Bucks](http://www.maineharvestbucks.org/) incentive program, which provides bonus fruits and vegetables to shoppers using SNAP. According to MFFMs Director of Programs, Jimmy DeBiasi, \"The number of EBT transactions made at Maine farmers markets has been steadily increasing throughout the state, which means more Mainers have better access to locally produced food.\" Application Information and Resources - Farms that sell products directly to consumers by way of farmers markets, Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) programs, and farm stands may be eligible. - Interested applicants can apply online: [https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RealMaineEBT](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RealMaineEBT)(Eligibility restrictions apply.) - For more information, contact Ali Zipparo at the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (207) 287-2232 or zipparo@maine.gov - To learn how your farmers market can accept SNAP benefits, contact Jimmy DeBiasi at the Maine Federation of Farmers Markets (207) 370 1524 or SNAP@mffm.org or [http://www.mainefarmersmarkets.org/market-managers/maine-harvest-bucks/](http://www.mainefarmersmarkets.org/market-managers/maine-harvest-bucks/) - Consumers should check with their local farms and farmers markets to inquire about whether they accept federal SNAP benefits. Agriculture and food operations, including farmers markets, CSAs, and farm stands, are considered essential services, and many remain open during the current civil state of emergency. Steps for Mainers to Follow Before Heading Outdoors April 2, 2020 Media Contacts Warren Whitney, Maine Coast Heritage Trust, [wwhitney@mcht.org](mailto:wwhitney@mcht.org) Jeremy Cluchey, The Nature Conservancy in Maine, [jeremy.cluchey@tnc.org](mailto:jeremy.cluchey@tnc.org) Jim Britt, DACF, [jim.britt@maine.gov](mailto:jim.britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA, Maine - The current \"Stay Healthy at Home\" mandate identifies engaging in outdoor exercise activities, such as walking, hiking, running, or biking as essential personal activities, provided they are conducted in accordance with all public health restrictions and guidance. Maine's conservation community, natural resource agencies, and outdoor brands want everyone to have the opportunity to get outside during this challenging time. Most of our publicly accessible conservation lands are available for healthy outdoor recreation. Still, we all must do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prevent unnecessary stress on our Maine Warden Service, Forest Rangers, and first responders. While some popular conservation lands have closed recently due to overuse and crowding, the vast majority remains open to the public. As spring weather arrives in Maine, it is critical that all individuals and families who head outdoors follow three simple steps: - Find the Right Time and Place - Be Prepared Before Heading Out - Heed All COVID-19 Health Warnings The following checklists will help us all enjoy Maines outdoors in ways that are safe and responsible during this difficult time. Before you hit the trail, cast a line, or launch a canoe, please be sure to: Find the Right Time and Place - Know What's Close to Home: Consider visiting a nearby [Wildlife Management great resource!) - Check before you go: Visit websites to see the latest information on closures or conditions. Please respect all property closures. - Have a plan B: If the parking lot is full, the destination is too crowded. If your first destination has a busy parking lot, go to the next spot on your list! - Avoid peak times: Get out earlier or later in the day. - Recharge in your backyard and neighborhood!: Spring in Maine means there is a lot to see and explore right in our own yards. Be Prepared Before Heading Out - Expect limited services: Facilities like public restrooms are likely closed, so plan accordingly. - Pack snacks and water: Do what you can to avoid having to make stops along the way. - Dress for success: It is spring in Maine, so trails are likely to be wet, muddy, slippery, or icy; bring appropriate gear to match the conditions. Local outdoor brands are open for online sales and are available to give advice on appropriate gear and equipment. - Don't take risks: Stick to easier terrain to avoid injuries, which add stress on first responders and medical resources. - Watch out for ticks: Wear light-colored pants, closed-toe shoes, and apply [EPA-approved bug repellent](https://www.epa.gov/insect-repellents). Heed All COVID-19 Health Warnings - Practice social distancing: Stay at least six feet away from other people who do not live in your household. If necessary, step aside when passing other people on the trail. And remember that groups of 10 or more are prohibited. - Don't linger: Shorten your stay when visiting natural stopping points such as waterfalls, summits, and viewpoints so everyone can enjoy them while maintaining a safe distance. - Don't touch: Avoid touching signs, kiosks, buildings, and benches to minimize the potential spread of the virus. - If you're sick, stay home: It puts others at risk when you leave home while exhibiting symptoms related to COVID-19, or if you have recently been exposed to the virus. If we all follow these guidelines and put public health first, we can enjoy Maine's natural resources in safe and responsible ways as we work through this difficult time together. # Appalachian Mountain Club Center for Community GIS Forest Society of Maine Maine Audubon Maine Coast Heritage Trust Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Maine Land Trust Network Maine Office of Outdoor Recreation Maine Outdoor Brands Maine Trails Coalition The Nature Conservancy in Maine Applications Open for the Allagash Wilderness Waterway Visiting Artist Program April 7, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA, MAINE - Applications are now open for the Allagash Wilderness Waterway (AWW) Visiting Artist Program, which brings artists to the remote wilderness of Maine for two-weeks of solitude. The program provides artists with the opportunity to immerse themselves in a remote, rustic wilderness, to interpret and share their experiences through their medium.

The letter to the Secretary comes after Governor Mills held a conference call earlier this month with Maine hunger and relief organizations, including Good Shepherd Food Bank, Wayside Food Programs, Full Plates Full Potential and Catholic Charities, who conveyed the difficulty in meeting the surge in demand for food resulting from COVID-19. \"Our farm and food producers, and those up and down the supply chain, continue to serve the people of Maine by growing and selling food amidst the enormous challenges that we face today. From the farmers' markets to the retail stores, the local gleaning networks to the community food pantries, Mainers are stepping up to the plate to ensure food is produced and disbursed in numerous ways while ensuring the health and safety of all involved,\" wrote Governor Mills. However, a patchwork of state efforts is not enough, and we urge the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to take a stronger leadership role in ensuring that people are getting the healthy and nutritious food that they deserve, and that the gaps in the supply chain are addressed. In her letter, Governor Mills suggested that the USDA partner with other federal agencies and leverage existing programs, such as the Emergency Food Assistance Program and the Section 32 Bonus Buy Back program, to procure and distribute more food. She also suggested prioritizing work with distributors to see that key items, such as canned foods, are distributed to emergency food providers. Governor Mills leadership on this issue is timely and proposes a solution that could help food banks across the country, said Amanda Beal, Commissioner, Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. Our hope is for the USDA to act as quickly as possible and leverage their assets and resources to help get the food our emergency food provider community needs in order to feed Maine people during this challenging time. The complete text of Governor Mills letter to USDA Secretary Perdue follows: April 13, 2020 The Honorable Sonny Perdue Secretary of Agriculture U.S. Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20250 Dear Secretary Perdue, I want to thank you for your continued leadership as Maine and the nation grapple with the realities of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our farm and food producers, and those up and down the supply chain, continue to serve the people of Maine by growing and selling food amidst the enormous challenges that we face today. From the farmers markets to the retail stores, the local gleaning networks to the community food pantries, Mainers are stepping up to the plate to ensure food is produced and disbursed in numerous ways while ensuring the health and safety of all involved. However, a patchwork of state efforts is not enough, and we urge the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to take a stronger leadership role in ensuring that people are getting the healthy and nutritious foods that they deserve, and that the gaps in the supply chain are adequately addressed. My administration has been working diligently to ensure that local Maine foods are available for all consumers; including at retail stores, food pantries, soup kitchens, and community markets. Just this past spring, I signed into law LD 786, An Act to Reduce Hunger and Promote Maine Agriculture, which awarded $2 million to Good Shepherd Food Bank, a statewide hunger-relief organization. This funding will be used to contract with local farmers to purchase food year-round for hunger relief efforts across the state of Maine. However, the growing season is only beginning to get underway, and the growing number of food insecure people in Maine, which has been exacerbated by COVID-19, need access to food today. I recently held a call with several emergency food providers who are working diligently across the state to meet this need. They reported that while food insecurity is rising exponentially in Maine, they are doing all they can to respond to this urgent need. My administration has continued to monitor the challenges our emergency food providers are facing, and to respond to their needs in any way that we can. I recognize that across this country, producers, distributors, wholesalers, and many others have responded admirably to adjust to the intense demands COVID-19 has placed upon our nations overall food supply. However, Maine, as with many states across the country, is experiencing disruption that is affecting emergency food providers in particular. Non-perishable foods such as canned goods, flour, beans and frozen items are often the first items off retail store shelves. Yet it is these key staples that are traditionally purchased by or donated to food pantries. As a result, food relief organizations are struggling with a critical lack of available food items to provide to their patrons. I respectfully ask that the USDA coordinate a strategic effort to increase the availability of food items to emergency food programs and partners in at least two ways: - By leveraging existing USDA programs such as The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), the Section 32 Bonus Buy program, and others within the USDAs jurisdiction, and by partnering with other federal agencies that have immediate purchasing and distribution powers. The USDA can procure and distribute more food through programs such as these. - By prioritizing work with distributors and others on food supply issues related to challenges specific to the emergency food system. When trying to purchase food for distribution themselves, emergency food providers are finding key items out of stock, and are told that they may be out of stock for up to several weeks. We know that there is an abundance of healthy foods available for people across our great nation. We must work together to ensure that this food is getting to those that need it the most. Sincerely, Janet T. Mills Governor cc: Commissioner Amanda Beal Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry # Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands Announces Recreational Trail Program Grants Available to Qualifying Projects April 15, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA - The Bureau of Parks and Lands (BPL) Grants and Community Recreation Program today announced the availability of Recreational Trails Program (RTP) funding.

Commissioner Beal Calls on USDA to Allow State-Inspected Meat to Cross State Lines during COVID-19 Pandemic May 8, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA- Yesterday, Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) Commissioner Amanda Beal called on the United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Program (USDA-FSIS) to temporarily lift restrictions preventing state-inspected meat from being sold or donated across state lines. Temporarily waiving USDA-FSIS place of sale restrictions allows more processing and market opportunities for Maine food producers and consumers during this unprecedented crisis. USDA processing facilities in Maine are under immense pressure to meet demand and are reportedly booked out over a year in some locations. \"Allowing state-inspected meat to temporarily cross state lines will greatly support regional market expansion opportunities, smooth out bottlenecks in the local food chain, reduce the need to cull healthy livestock and poultry, and support our food-insecure during this extremely difficult time,\" wrote Commissioner Beal. 50% of state processing facilitates are already operating under the federal Cooperative Interstate Shipment (CIS) program, and DACF is confident that state-inspected facilities can maintain appropriate oversight as this waiver is considered. The complete text of Commissioner Beals letter is below: Mr. Joseph Priore Acting Regional Director USDA- FSIS 701 Market Street, Suite 4100C Philadelphia, PA 19106 Dear Mr. Priore, In Maine and across the country, state departments of agriculture are doing everything that we can to keep the food supply chain operating smoothly. Just as importantly, we are working to ensure that the food our farmers are working hard to produce is getting into the hands of those that need it - whether a consumer at a retail store or at a local food pantry - rather than slaughtering or culling animals because of disruptions in the supply chain. Maine signed a cooperative agreement with USDA-FSIS to join the federal Cooperative Interstate Shipment program (CIS) in August of 2018. The CIS program allows state-inspected plants within the program to label their products with a federal mark of inspection and ship their products in interstate commerce and internationally. Any state-inspected plant which hasnt yet joined the CIS program is limited to sales within its borders, even if a neighboring state is just across the highway or river. This program has proven very successful in Maine so far, with three of our state processors (50%) participating in the program and shipping over 55,000 pounds of meat and poultry over the last 3 months bearing the Federal mark of inspection. All state-inspected facilities, CIS and non-CIS alike, adhere to the same strict federal food safety and processing regulations as do the USDA-FSIS facilities. Most importantly, we are confident that our state-inspected facilities can maintain appropriate oversight through this process because the Maine Meat and Poultry Inspection (Maine MPI) program, which oversees the state-inspected facilities, has earned and maintains same as status with USDA-FSIS. Given the current challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, we ask that FSIS grant a temporary waiver to allow all state-inspected meat to be sold in interstate commerce or to be donated to food banks that require federally inspected products. This temporary waiver would lift usual restrictions on place of sale and allow for more processing and market opportunities for Maine food producers and consumers during this unprecedented crisis. USDA processing facilities in Maine are under immense pressure to meet demand and are reportedly booked out over a year in advance in some locations. Allowing state-inspected meat to temporarily cross state lines will greatly support regional market expansion opportunities, smooth out bottlenecks in the local food chain, reduce the need to cull healthy livestock and poultry, and support those who are food-insecure during this extremely difficult time. Sincerely, Amanda Beal Commissioner Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry # Invasive Trifecta, May 18-22: Emerald Ash Borer Awareness Week, Arbor Week, and National Invasive Species Awareness Week May 18, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA-May 18-22, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) is marking Emerald Ash Borer Awareness Week, Arbor Week and with states across the nation, National Invasive Species Awareness Week (NISAW). EAB AWARENESS WEEK DACF's Forest Health & Monitoring and Animal and Plant Health divisions are asking everyone to take time out for trees and, in particular, look at ash trees for signs of the destructive emerald ash borer (EAB). Since discovering EAB in northern Aroostook County in May of 2018 and western York County, during September 2018, DACF established a quarantine to protect Maine's forest and timber resources. With a Cumberland County discovery (Payson Park, in Portland Sep 2019), Maine's EAB quarantine also includes Cumberland County and four southwestern towns in Oxford County. Early detection of EAB in new areas helps the MFS target resources to help slow the natural and human aided spread of this devastating insect and homeowners and land managers make informed decisions about managing their ash trees. \"EAB is a real threat to ash trees in Maine,\" DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal said. \"Our ash trees appear to have little native resistance, and the borer kills trees very quickly. We need to know if the borer is here, and we need everyone's help.\" The brilliant green adult beetles will not be visible in Maine this time of year, but there are many signs our ash trees may show when infested. The Department site [www.maine.gov/eab](www.maine.gov/eab) is an excellent resource to learn more about EAB and to report suspected attacks. EAB is native to Asia and probably hitched a ride to North America on crates, pallets, or other solid-wood packing material in the late 1990s. Movement of infested firewood has been a critical part of its rapid spread across eastern North America. EAB can move only about a half a mile a year on its own but can move hundreds of miles in a single day within a piece of infested firewood. Emerald ash borer is not the only threat to our forests that can move in the seemingly good firewood. Numerous other insects and diseases can also hitchhike in wood. Spread the word: use local heat-treated firewood. If you have friends or family planning to visit Maine, make sure they are aware of the state and federal rules that ban the movement of untreated firewood ( [www.maine.gov/firewood](http://www.maine.gov/firewood)). Sources of treated or local firewood can be found online at firewood scout [http://firewoodscout.org/s/ME/](http://firewoodscout.org/s/ME/</a>.). ARBOR WEEK Arbor Week happens each spring, and MFS and [Project Canopy](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/policy_management/project_canopy/) use this as a focused opportunity to encourage people to plant and care for trees. It is also the perfect opportunity for everyone to learn more about invasive insects threatening Maine's urban landscapes and forests. In addition to educational opportunities, during Arbor Week, MFS and Project Canopy honor communities throughout Maine who have earned Tree City USA designation. These are cities and towns with strong urban- and community forestry programs and community leaders and citizens dedicated to protecting and growing their investment. Tree City USA awards set the standard high for others to follow. NATIONAL INVASIVE SPECIES AWARENESS WEEK NISAW is a nationwide event designed to raise awareness of invasive species. In Maine, invasive species are more than a threat, and they are taking their toll on the economy. Invasive terrestrial plants threaten Maine's wildlife and can harm working forests and productive farms. Plants such as glossy buckthorn steadily invade high-quality forests, crowd out native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers, and out-compete the next generation of trees. Along rivers and streams, Japanese knotweed forms dense stands that worsen flooding and prevent colonization by native plants. Knotweed roots and shoots are carried downstream in floodwaters, spreading the problem to new locations. Maine prohibits the sale of [thirty-three species of invasive plants](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/horticulture/invasiveplants.shtml), and over 100 species are listed on an Advisory List of invasive plants to help guide land managers. The Maine Natural Areas Program (MNAP) within DACF tracks invasive plant distribution and management using the online mapping tool [iMapInvasives](http://www.imapinvasives.org/). It encourages Mainers to work with their town conservation commission, local land trust, or garden club to spread the word about invasive plants and work together to remove them. For more information, visit the [MNAP website](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/features/invasive_plants/imap.htm)or [iMapInvasives.org](http://iMapInvasives.org). Maine's forest trees are under attack from multiple invasive forest insect pests, and the threat of new pests invading Maine is constant. Invasive insects such as EAB and hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA) will forever change Maine's forests as they spread and continue to kill trees throughout the state. Other invasive pests like browntail moth directly affect human health by causing severe skin rashes and respiratory reactions. Other nearby invasive insects like Asian longhorned beetle or diseases like oak wilt have similar potential to destroy Maine's forests even more so in the future if they hitchhike within infested firewood. MFS has a strict out-of-state firewood ban to prevent devastating introductions like these. Natural resource managers everywhere continue to encourage the use of [local firewood](http://www.firewoodscout.org/s/ME/)at DACF, the divisions of [Forest Health & Monitoring](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/index.htm)and and Plant Health](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/index.shtml), working together as [Maine Bug Watch](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/index.shtml), monitor and control invasive insects and diseases whenever possible. (Courtesy MIFW) The illegal stocking of species like northern pike, black crappie, or largemouth bass can have the most significant and apparent impacts on Maine's native fisheries. Still, sometimes the release of new fish species can occur for other reasons. These illegal acts are often intentional, for instance, when someone wants a particular species of sport fish in a lake close to their home. Unintentional introductions can happen as a result of negligence related to threats found in an angler's bait bucket. While the level of risk from this type of introduction may be less than that from the intentional establishment of large predatory species, impacts to native fish populations can occur. MDIFW already limits the fish species that can legally be used as bait and prohibits the unauthorized importation of baitfish from outside the state as two strategies to reduce risk. Still, recently a third strategy was employed to increase awareness related to using live fish as bait. In January 2020, MDIFW changed fishing regulations in northern Maine to prohibit the use of live fish as bait under the general law and only allow fishing with live bait fish on certain waters (listed explicitly in [Maine's Open Water and Ice Fishing Laws](https://www.maine.gov/ifw/maine-outdoors-laws.html)). This change reinforces the importance of this region's abundant native and wild fishery resources. It stresses the potential damage to those fisheries with the introduction of baitfish where they don't belong. Maine's pristine lakes are also threatened by invasive aquatic plants. The infestation of Maine's lakes and ponds by aggressive non-indigenous plants has the potential to interfere with recreation, alter fish and wildlife habitat, degrade water quality and overshadow virtually all other lake water quality issues and concerns. This form of \"biological pollution\" is self-sustaining. One inadvertently transplanted plant fragment or seed from a boat trailer is all that it takes to begin this environmental nightmare. Maine is the final frontier to be conquered by many of these \"aquatic invaders.\" All of our neighboring states are embroiled in costly and frustrating battles to control invasive aquatic species (IAS).

Here are 13 ways to participate: 1. Plant a native tree or shrub. Replacing lawn areas with diverse plantings of native woody and herbaceous plants helps support pollinators and food webs better than introduced ornamentals. Some native plants support much more life than others. Choose the best plants for your area by using the Native Plant Trust's [Garden Plant Finder](https://plantfinder.nativeplanttrust.org/Plant-Search). And for information on how to plant your tree, refer to the USDA Forest Service [\"Tree Owner's Manual](https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5368392.pdf).\" 2. Learn how to identify ash trees. May is a great time to identify ash trees. While all the other hardwood trees are leafing out, Maine's ash trees still look like sticks in the sky. Look for opposite branching and small-ridged bark in a diamond-shaped pattern. 3. Learn how to [identify signs of emerald ash borer](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/EABtrees.shtml). Now that you know what an ash tree looks like look for signs of emerald ash borer in the trees. You may spot \"blonding\" on ash trees, the shallow flecking of the bark by woodpeckers going after EAB larvae and pupae. If you think you see \"blonding,\" take some good quality photos, note your location, and report your findings on the [EAB Report Form](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/EABreportFORM.shtml). 4. Learn how to [identify emerald ash borer](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/EABid.shtml). Chances are, you won't see EAB adults in May, but come June, you may see some as they start to emerge from ash trees. If you think you see an EAB, try to capture it or take a photo and report your findings on the [EAB Report Form](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/EABreportFORM.shtml). 5. Look for tagged ash trees! During Emerald Ash Borer Awareness Week (May 18-22), DACF staff and friends from Soil and Water Conservation Districts will be putting tags on ash trees. These tags help the public become aware of emerald ash borer's impact on ash trees and the community. Look for these tags on street trees and trails in these towns: Augusta, Belfast, Bridgton, Gorham, Houlton, Madawaska, Madison, Norway, Skowhegan, Unity, and Windham. 6. Create a [girdled ash tree to monitor for emerald ash borer](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab_trap_trees.htm). Your tree can be part of the monitoring network for EAB. Knowing the whereabouts of EAB helps the DACF and others make good management decisions about ash. 7. Leave your firewood at home and prevent the spread of invasive pests. Planning a camping trip? Buy firewood at the campground or go to [FirewoodScout.org](http://www.firewoodscout.org/) to find other local sources. 8. Learn more about invasive species. Maine Forest Service has [archived forest health webinars](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbG7nZT9BO--uN5JO8fJbfYs4Qmn1wVvx) available to watch. The University of Maine Cooperative Extension and Maine DACF will offer [two live, free webinars on invasive plant identification and management](https://extension.umaine.edu/gardening/invasive-plant-webinars/) and by attending you become eligible to receive a free copy of the [Get a free account](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/about/publications/mipfg.htmlMaine Invasive Plants Field Guide</a>! </p> <p><strong>9. a Citizen <a href=) and use the [iMapInvasives online mapping tool](http://www.imapinvasives.org/) to map locations of invasive species on public property and on private property with landowner permission. 10. Spread awareness and celebrate the state's trees. Take your National Invasive Species Awareness Week commitment beyond this week. Tell your friends, family, neighbors and others about invasive species! It's a big state, and we can't get the word out to everyone without your help. Encourage them to get involved with National Invasive Species Awareness Week in their own way. Here are some resources to help get started: 11. Find a nearby trail in a forest (or park) and go for a walk, hike, or bike ride. Natural settings are effective in lowering stress. Exercising outdoors compared to exercising indoors helps people feel more revitalized, engaged with others, and less tense. Use the [Maine Trail Finder](https://www.mainetrailfinder.com/) to get directions, trail maps, and current information on trail closures. 12. Use indoor days for natural arts and crafts. Pinterest is full of creative ideas for crafts made with natural materials like pine cones, needles, leaves, and twigs. See what you can find in your backyard and let your imagination get to work. We like this pine cone bird feeder tutorial from the Kratt Brothers. 13. Find and measure a champion tree. Many state champions are located on public property or along city streets. Some of them include the northern red oak in Augusta, green ash and pin oak in Portland, red spruce in Little Moose township, red pine in Weld, and the eastern cottonwood in Orono. Contact the Maine Forest Service for specific locations. [Here's how](https://youtu.be/kevUY5xHLo0) to measure a tree and calculate its points.

May 20, 2020 Media Contacts Warren Whitney, Maine Coast Heritage Trust, [wwhitney@mcht.org](mailto:wwhitney@mcht.org) Jeremy Cluchey, The Nature Conservancy in Maine, [jeremy.cluchey@tnc.org](mailto:jeremy.cluchey@tnc.org) Jim Britt, DACF, [jim.britt@maine.gov](jim.britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA, Maine - Biking, boating, hiking, fishing, birdwatching, and other outdoor activities are great ways to stay healthy in the age of COVID-19 provided they are conducted in accordance with all public health restrictions and guidance. As summer weather is fast approaching, Maine's conservation and recreation communities, natural resource agencies, and outdoor brands developed the following checklists to help us all enjoy Maines outdoors in ways that are safe and responsible during this difficult time. Before you hit the trail, cast a line, or launch a canoe, please be sure to: Find the Right Time and Place - Know Whats Available: Consider visiting a nearby great resource!) - Check before you go: While some popular conservation lands have closed recently due to overuse and crowding, the vast majority remains open to the public. Visit websites to see the latest information on closures or conditions. Please respect all property closures. - Have a plan B: If the parking lot is full, the destination is too crowded. If your first destination has a busy parking lot, go to the next spot on your list! - Avoid peak times: Get out earlier or later in the day. Be Prepared Before Heading Out - Expect limited services: Facilities like public restrooms could be closed, so plan accordingly. - Dress for success: Be aware of current conditions and bring appropriate gear to match those conditions. Local outdoor brands are open for online sales and are available to give advice on appropriate gear and equipment. - Support local businesses: Many local businesses from restaurants and retailers to guides and lodges are working hard to provide services in ways that are safe and in keeping with public health rules and guidance. If you're comfortable, consider finding ways to support them while you're enjoying the outdoors. - Don't take risks: Stick to familiar terrain and avoid unnecessary chances to avoid injuries, which add stress on first responders and medical resources. - Be aware of the rules: Check before you go to see what activities are allowed. If dogs are permitted remember to bring a leash and to properly dispose of waste. - Watch out for ticks and biting insects: Wear light-colored pants, closed-toe shoes, and apply EPA-approved bug repellent. - Leave home prepared with sanitizer and disinfectant. Heed All COVID-19 Health Warnings - Practice social distancing: Stay at least six feet away from other people who do not live in your household. If necessary, step aside when passing other people on the trail. - Don't linger: Shorten your stay when visiting natural stopping points such as waterfalls, summits, and viewpoints so everyone can enjoy them while maintaining a safe distance. - Bring a mask: When you're in the vicinity of others, even with six feet of separation, a mask will help keep everyone safer. - Don't touch: Avoid touching signs, kiosks, buildings, and benches to minimize the potential spread of the virus. - If you're sick, stay home: It puts others at risk when you leave home while exhibiting symptoms related to COVID-19, or if you have recently been exposed to the virus. If we all follow these guidelines and put public health first, we can enjoy Maine's natural resources in safe and responsible ways as we work through this difficult time together. Commissioner Beal calls on USDA to reopen bidding process and rectify challenges of the Farmers to Families Food Box Program May 21, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA- Today, Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) Commissioner Amanda Beal called on the USDA Agriculture Marketing Service (USDA-AMS) to strengthen the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program's (CFAP) Farmers to Food Box initiative. Challenges resulted in no Maine distributors being selected to participate in this critically important program. \"Farmers in our state have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic but are eager to continue to grow food for consumers. Likewise, many families in Maine need extra support during this unprecedented time, and it has been projected that food insecurity in Maine could increase by as much as 39 percent in 2020 due to COVID-19,\" wrote Commissioner Beal. In addition to this direct outreach to USDA-AMS, DACF is continuing to work with Maine's congressional delegation and statewide and national partners in advocating for federal programs, like CFAP, to ensure they work for Maine. Beal's request is for a second RFP in the fall, where regional distributors and Maine can have another chance in the bid process. The complete text of Commissioner Beal's letter is below: May 21, 2020 Mr. Bruce Summers Administrator USDA Agriculture Marketing Service 1400 Independence Ave., SW Washington, D.C. 20250-3601 Dear Mr. Summers, We appreciate the efforts of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Agriculture Marketing Service (AMS) in rolling out the new Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP). This critical program aims to help provide direct support to farmers while maintaining the integrity of our food supply chain and ensuring Americans have access to healthy foods that they need. Maine has a rich and diverse agriculture industry, comprised of producers and nonprofit service providers and other businesses of all sizes that are interested in participating in the Farmers to Families Food Box Program. Unfortunately, given the many logistical challenges of operating a new program and the short turnaround for the bidding process, no Maine distributors were selected for this program. Additionally, most of the distributors that serve Maine who were awarded contracts will not be supplying food boxes due to either capacity or quality and food safety concerns. We ask that the USDA strongly consider reopening the bidding process for this fall, which will give distributors and partners in Maine adequate time to thoughtfully develop a plan to implement this program. Additionally, we suggest that the USDA consider enhancing flexibility of the design and assembly of boxes to allow for local producer boxes, filled with state-produced vegetables, dairy, and meat products that may be distributed across smaller regions throughout each state. Local partners know first-hand how to maximize efficiency, reduce food safety issues, and streamline labor and distribution methods. Additional flexibility of box design and assembly requirements will allow for more state partners to participate in the program. Like all small businesses in Maine, farmers in our state have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic but are eager to continue to grow food for consumers. Likewise, many families in Maine need extra support during this unprecedented time, and it has been projected that food insecurity in Maine could increase by as much as 39 percent in 2020 due to COVID-19. We are confident that the Farmers to Families Food Box Program can help provide much-needed support for both, but only if the program can be adapted and flexibility be given to fit individual state needs. Thank you for your thoughtful attention to these requests. I'd be happy to discuss these matters in further detail at your convenience. Sincerely, Amanda Beal Commissioner Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry # # Adding Three Custom Meat Processors to Maine's Food Supply Chain Aims to Ease Bottlenecks May 29, 2020 Contacts: Jim Britt, [jim.britt@maine.gov](mailto:jim.britt@maine.gov) Dr. Jennifer Eberly, [jennifer.eberly@maine.gov](mailto:jennifer.eberly@maine.gov) AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's (DACF) Maine Meat and Poultry Inspection (MMPI) program is responding to the increased demand for local meat during the COVID-19 pandemic by easing a processing bottleneck in the food supply chain. MMPI is authorizing 90-day grants of inspection to three Maine-based custom slaughter operations, starting June 1. The temporary authorizations apply to Hatch's Custom Meat Cutting in Crystal; Watson's Custom Butcher Shop in Etna; and Blake's Slaughtering and Custom Cut Meats in Alexander. Hatch's and Blake's will be the first inspected livestock slaughterhouses in Aroostook and Washington Counties. \"Farmers need to get their animals to market, and this temporary authorization eases the process and allows more locally-raised meat to reach Maine people,\" stated Amanda Beal, DACF Commissioner. \"We are pleased that this action will relieve extended wait times to schedule USDA-inspected services, and that inspected meat processing will be available in two underrepresented areas of the state.\" Meat and poultry products sold in commerce must be inspected daily by either the USDA-Food Safety Inspection Service (FSIS) or DACF's [MMPI Program](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/qar/inspection_programs/red_meat_poultry_inspection.shtml). By law, custom slaughter operations are inspected annually by DACF, and the meat does not enter commerce. \"We are excited to welcome these custom processors to the MMPI program and to offer Maine livestock producers new local options to have their animals processed,\" commented Dr. Jennifer Eberly, State Veterinarian, and MMPI Director. \"We are fortunate to collaborate with Drs. Jason Bolton and Robson Machado, University of Maine Cooperative Extension, on this project, as they provided invaluable assistance in food safety plan coordination and review.\" The processors will have to meet the same food safety, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP), and humane handling regulations as other state and USDA inspected facilities. Sales of beef and pork products will be restricted to in-state sales only. The three custom operators joining MMPI were selected based on the geographic need for inspected services, processor capacity to institute HACCP review, review of physical facilities, prior annual inspection reports, and MMPI inspection staff capacity.

As of Monday, June 1, Maine residents and non-residents who have completed the 14-day quarantine, are invited to return to the following State Parks: - Crescent Beach State Park - Kettle Cove State Park - Two Lights State Park - Ferry Beach State Park - Scarborough Beach State Park - Mackworth Island - Reid State Park - Popham Beach State Park - Fort Popham - Fort Baldwin BPL's ten coastal State Parks initially closed March 26, due to overcrowding, and the closure extended to June 1, following Governor Mill's plan to gradually and safely restart Maine's economy. The June 1 date coincides with Stage 2 of the Restarting Maine's Economy plan. The opening comes after careful consideration and planning to ensure everyone's safety, including visitors and staff. BPL is coordinating its phased reopening with local law enforcement, first responders, and state public safety officials. The beaches will be open from 9 am to sunset. To support safe physical distancing, beach capacity is limited by 50% until further notice. Visitors can expect restroom facility delays and closures, as well as closures and limited access to water fountains, rinse showers, playgrounds, nature centers, fort buildings, museums, historic buildings. \"I am calling on everyone visiting a beach State Park to honor distancing guidelines to protect each other and our park staff,\" DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal stated. \"We are closely monitoring conditions at the beaches and all of our State Parks and plan to make modifications as needed.\" To support Maine CDC's efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, BPL is asking the public to play their part. With working together in mind, here are a few reminders developed by DACF and Maine Inland Fish and Wildlife on how to get fresh air while staying safe. Avoid Crowds - Visit a lesser-known spot and explore places close to home. Consider visiting a nearby Wildlife Management Area, or less trafficked [state park](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/index.shtml), [public land](https://www.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/doc/parksearch/index.pl), or local [land trust](https://www.mltn.org/). - Have a plan B (and C). If your first destination has a busy parking lot, go to the next spot on your list! [Maine Trail Finder](https://www.mainetrailfinder.com/)is a great resource. - Get outside earlier or later in the day to avoid peak times, and please keep your visits brief. - Recharge in your backyard and neighborhood! Backyard adventures in the time of coronavirus are an excellent idea. Know before you go - If you are exhibiting symptoms related to COVID-19, or if you were recently to COVID-19, please stay home. - Stay at least six feet away from other people at all times. - At the beach State Parks, limit your stay so that others may enjoy the beach as you have. - Plan your stay for less popular times - mornings or late afternoons. - Stick to easy trails to avoid injuries and further stress on health care resources. - Be sure to tell someone where you are going and when you expect to be back. - Be prepared for limited access to public restrooms (use the bathroom before you leave home). - Bring disinfectant, hand sanitizer, and wear a mask or face covering. - Always leave no trace, including cleaning up after your pet, so be sure to bring a disposable bag to carry out any waste. (No pets are allowed on State Park beaches between April 1 and September 30.) - And remember to take precautions to prevent exposure to ticks by wearing light-colored pants, closed-toe shoes, and applying EPA-approved bug repellent. BPL is closely monitoring the coronavirus situation and following guidance provided by the Governor's Office and the Maine Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Maine Emergency Management Agency. Answers to questions about Maine State Parks Q: Is it going to be business as usual inside the partially open coastal State Parks A: No. Visitors should arrive prepared with sanitizer and disinfectant, some seasonal restrooms and drinking fountains and other amenities will likely not be open or in service. Stay informed of all BPL updates @ [https://parksandlands.com](https://parksandlands.com</a>.). Q: Can I park on the street or road outside of a State Park and walk-in? A: Everyone is required to respect parking signage on roads adjacent to State Parks and to respect our neighbors. Q: How might my visit to a Maine State Park be different than usual? A: Our State Parks are seeing above-average use, and with increased numbers comes the need to be extra vigilant and follow precautions advised by the Maine CDC. The guidance includes frequent washing of hands for at least 20 seconds using soap and hot water, coughing and sneezing into tissues, and promptly disposing of the tissue, and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth. It is also essential is to prevent gatherings of 10 or more people and to practice physical distancing of at least six feet, from person to person. For the latest Maine CDC guidance, visit their website and to track Maine's reopening plan. Q: What do curtailed services mean? A: Hours of operation are 9 am to sunset unless otherwise posted; playgrounds and some restroom facilities are closed to the public. Please note park access may change without notice. Michael Vermette selected as Allagash Wilderness Waterway Visiting Artist June 3, 2020 For more information contact: Matt LaRoche at: matt.laroche@maine.gov AUGUSTA- Today, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) announced the selection of Michael Vermette as the Allagash Wilderness Waterway (AWW) Visiting Artist for 2020. DACF initiated its AWW Visiting Artist Program to celebrate the long-standing tradition of artists capturing the Allagash's beauty and solitude. Vermette, based in Old Town, Maine, is a full-time artist and part-time teacher. He holds a BFA in Painting and has been painting in oil, watercolor, and pastel for over 45 years. He has won numerous awards, and his paintings are in private collections globally. Vermette will spend two weeks immersed in the Allagash beauty at the Waterway's Lock Dam Cabin. During his stay, he will hold an open studio session and a public program. His goal is to explore the Maine wilderness and paint it in plein air. In painting the bold and spectacular Allagash Wilderness Waterway, Vermette intends to capture imagery that would imprint itself on the Maine consciousness. \"We received world-class applications,\" stated Amanda Beal, DACF Commissioner. \"The quantity and breadth made judging a joy, and it was a privilege to be introduced to the work of so many talented people.\" \"The response to our call for artists was truly amazing,\" commented Matt LaRoche, AWW Superintendent. \"We received 130 applications, many from Maine, from across the US and as far away as India!\" The artist selection process included a team of DACF judges reviewing each of the applications. Selection criteria included judging proposal thoroughness, quality of artwork samples, and open studio concepts.

Spread out a bit and explore! June 11, 2020 Even without health concerns related to COVID-19, overcrowding can make recreation experiences less enjoyable and negatively impact the ecology of the wonderful parks and lands we all share. And with social distancing being so important to public health, overcrowding also risks your health and the health of our communities. Thankfully, there are some steps you can take to avoid overcrowding recreation destinations. One step to combat crowding is to seek out lesser-known, less heavily visited destinations. Already overflowing this spring have been places such as Tumbledown Mountain Public Land, campgrounds at the Bigelow Preserve Public Land, Camden Hills State Park, the Sunrise and Four Seasons Rail Trails, as well as some sites not managed by the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands. Other wonderful destinations await without the crowding. Here's how to find them: [Maine Trail Finder](http://www.mainetrailfinder.com/)and [Adventure Local Maine](https://www.adventurelocalmaine.com/)are great tools for discovering places to hike and bike. It also includes listings for water trails. - The Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands [Find Parks and Lands feature](https://www.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/doc/parksearch/index.pl)helps direct you to information on the Bureaus varied destinations. - Look for [public boat launches](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/water_activities/boating/public_boat_launches/boat_sites.shtml)for on-the-water adventures across the state. [Maine ATV clubs](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/trail_activities/atv/clubs.shtml)support trail maintenance and management.

More Tips: - Visit on the traditionally less busy days: Monday through Thursday. If it safely suits your activity, consider a visit earlier or later in the day. - Make a back-up plan in case your first choice of location or activity is crowded or full. - If camping in an area without reservations, plan to arrive early enough in the day to adjust if your anticipated site is already taken. This is especially important for backpacking and paddling trips. - Stay up-to-date on current conditions by [subscribing to our Alerts](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/MEDACF/subscriber/new). - Learn about [Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org/)skills and ethics to better prepare for minimizing your impacts and staying safe, - Please remember to share this with the outdoor enthusiasts in your life.

New Roots is applying its grant funding toward scaling up the Lewiston farm's wholesale and direct-retail marketing operations. \"As a farmer-owned distribution company, Daybreak Growers Alliance seeks to grow market opportunities for over 50 Maine farms and food producers. This year is especially critical as Daybreak enters its second year in business and faces increased challenges due to the COVID19 pandemic. While the pandemic is creating market disruption, it is also creating accelerated growth opportunities for those local food businesses equipped to respond to these changes. This grant will allow us to build our capacity, agility, and efficiency in our response to these market changes.\" - Colleen Hanlon-Smith, Wholesale Supervisor at Daybreak Growers Alliance. Daybreak Growers Alliance is applying its grant funding to respond to increased consumer demand for a customized CSA delivery program. \"This 2020 ADG grant will allow us to expand the availability of Maine-grown and processed hops by further equipping our hop processing facility not only to increase our efficiency but also to serve other emerging farmers. Our goals are to increase the amount of Maine-grown hops that are included as ingredients in local craft beer for the state's expanding brewing sector, and also to help new growers overcome many of the barriers to entry in Aroostook county.\" - Krista Delahunty, Aroostook Hops. Established by the Maine Legislature in 1996, the ADG program funds projects that accelerate new market development, the adoption of improved technology, and the promotion of agricultural products produced in Maine. Grants are awarded every one to two years through a competitive proposal process. # Supporting documents Maine Forest Service Temporarily Suspends Online Burning Brush Permits June 23, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 480-0558 OLD TOWN - Due to increased wildfire risk, fire occurrences, and staffing shortages, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Maine Forest Service (MFS) is temporarily halting issuing online open burning permits required for the outdoor burning of brush and wood debris. These conditions will remain in effect until the state sees an adequate level of precipitation. Also, MFS Director Patty Cormier is urging Maine's fire chiefs and town forest fire wardens to use extreme caution or suspend the issuance of written open burning brush permits. Campfire permits, required for some remote campsites in unorganized towns, remain available. MFS reminds everyone to obtain landowner permission and seek campfire permits which are available from MFS. Recreational campfires on one's own property for cooking and warming, unless prohibited by local ordinance, do not require an open burning permit and are not subject to this suspension. The suspension of online permits for brush burning will continue until further notice. \"While we are temporarily suspending Maine's online burning permit systems, we are also going to rely on the experience of our Forest Rangers and our dedicated partners in the municipal fire service to ensure that Maine is protected from this current wildfire threat,\" commented Cormier. Maine Wildfire Update Maine is experiencing an abnormally high number of wildfires. To date, Forest Rangers have responded to 712 fires, representing 871 acres. This is the second-highest fire count in 10 years, and it's only June. So far, there has been a 170% increase in wildfires caused by campfires compared to 2019. Campfire Safety Tips - Before considering burning, check [www.mainefireweather.org](http://www.mainefireweather.org)for local fire conditions. - Keep the fire small, not tall. That way, if you have to leave suddenly, it is easy to extinguish. - The campfire should be at least 50 feet away from any structures and on level ground. - Do not use accelerants to start your fire. - Always have plenty of water on hand and tools available to put out the fire. - When you are done, check the fire several times to ensure it is out. - Supervise children and pets near the fire and never leave your fire unattended. About MFS Since 1891, the mission of MFS is to protect and enhance forest resources through fire prevention, technical assistance, education, outreach to a wide variety of audiences; and enforcement of forest protection laws.

Maine Forest Service Lifts Brush Burning Restrictions June 30, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 287-3156 OLD TOWN - Due to increased rainfall, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Maine Forest Service (MFS), aligned with local fire departments and town forest fire wardens, today lifted the statewide brush burning restriction. The online brush and debris burning permit restriction recently went into effect due to extreme fire danger, with the initial notification stating it would remain in effect until the state sees adequate levels of precipitation. Though lifted, depending on precipitation levels in the coming weeks, the brush and debris fire permit restriction may be restarted. Access the online burn permit system @ [www.maineburnpermit.com](www.maineburnpermit.com). Fireworks Safety Tips The following recommendations are offered to use fireworks safely by the Office of State Fire Marshal and the MFS - A person may use consumer fireworks only on that person's property or on the property of a person who has consented to that use of fireworks on that property. - Consumer fireworks may be used between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. except on the following dates when they may be used between 9:00 a.m. and 12:30 a.m. the following day: - July 4th - December 31st, and - The weekends immediately before and after July 4th and December 31st - Users and those in possession of consumer fireworks must be 21 years of age. - Set off fireworks outdoors in a clear area, away from houses, dry leaves, or grass and other flammable materials. - Keep a bucket of water nearby for emergencies. Do not handle fireworks that fail to go off. Use a long-handled shovel to scoop up the firework and immerse it in the bucket of water. - Do not try to relight or handle malfunctioning fireworks. Soak them with water and throw them away. - Be sure other people and children are out of range before lighting fireworks. - Never light fireworks in a container, especially a glass or metal container. - Keep unused fireworks away from firing areas. - Always use fireworks according to the 'manufacturer's directions and guidelines. - Always use eye, ear, and hand personal protective equipment. - Observe all local laws and ordinances. - Never have any portion of your body directly over a firework while lighting. - When the use of fireworks is done, continue to watch the area of use to be sure that all fireworks debris is out and not smoldering or hot. - Search any forested area adjacent to and downwind of the ignition site looking for hot or smoldering debris. Scan the forest canopy, as well as the ground. If a wildfire occurs as a result of negligence, then you may be responsible for fire suppression costs. - In case of emergency, dial 911.

ATV Registrations Now Required for 2020-2021 July 2, 2020 Amended Executive Order lifts interim suspension on ATV registrations AUGUSTA - ATV owners must now register or renew registrations for 2020-2021. ATV registrations are valid for 12-months, July 1 to June 30, and [easy registration renewals are available online](https://moses.informe.org/online/atv_snow/index.htm). New registrations must occur through a registration agent or the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife main office in Augusta. Riders unable to register an ATV online or at a town office should call (207) 287-8000. ATV registration fees provide the funding to build and maintain Maine's trail system and support ATV clubs and volunteers who provide the critical work to maintain trails systems. Annual registration also assists private landowners who allow trail access. Riders are encouraged to remember that without the use of private land, most trails would not exist. The ability to ride is a privilege granted by the landowner, and all riders must respect their wishes and treat private land as if it were their own. Learn more about Maine's [ATV program](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/about/atv_program.shtml). Tips for ATV riders - Never drink and ride! - Stay on marked ATV trails (ATV trails have green and white signs. Not all snowmobile trails are ATV trails). - Drive to the right and at an appropriate speed. - Tread lightly - Don't tear up the trail! - Remember that modified exhausts are illegal. - Be respectful of ATV access routes - yield to all traffic and never pass a vehicle. Avoid crowded trails, spread out a bit and explore Overcrowding can make recreation experiences less enjoyable and negatively impact the ecology of the wonderful parks and lands we all share. And with social distancing being so important to public health, overcrowding also risks your health and the health of our communities. Thankfully, there are some steps you can take to avoid overcrowding recreation destinations. One step to combat crowding is to seek out lesser-known, less heavily visited destinations. Already overflowing this spring have been places such as Tumbledown Mountain Public Land, campgrounds at the Bigelow Preserve Public Land, Camden Hills State Park, the Sunrise and Four Seasons Rail Trails, as well as some sites not managed by the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands. Other wonderful destinations await without the crowding [Maine Trail Finder](http://www.mainetrailfinder.com/)and [Adventure Local Maine](https://www.adventurelocalmaine.com/)are great tools for discovering places to hike and bike. It also includes listings for water trails. - The Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands' [Find Parks and Lands](https://www.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/doc/parksearch/index.pl)feature helps direct you to information on the Bureaus varied destinations. - Look for [public boat launches](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/water_activities/boating/public_boat_launches/boat_sites.shtml)for on-the-water adventures across the state. [Maine ATV clubs](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/trail_activities/atv/clubs.shtml)support trail maintenance and management. Joining a club is a great way to learn about riding opportunities and to give back to the trails. More Tips: - Visit on the traditionally less busy days: Monday through Thursday. If it safely suits your activity, consider a visit earlier or later in the day. - Make a back-up plan in case your first choice of location or activity is crowded or full. - If camping in an area without reservations, plan to arrive early enough in the day to adjust if your anticipated site is already taken. This is especially important for backpacking and paddling trips. - Stay up-to-date on current conditions by subscribing to our Alerts. - Learn about [Leave No Trace](https://lnt.org/)skills and ethics to better prepare for minimizing your impacts and staying safe. Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry reminds everyone about the risk of accidentally spreading invasive species while moving firewood July 9, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) is reminding the public about the risk of spreading tree-killing invasive species while moving firewood. New infestations of invasive pests or diseases pose a serious threat to Maine's landscapes, trees, agriculture, forests, wildlife, and the environment. Harmful invasive species, some of which are invisible to the naked eye, can hide in or on firewood. While most cannot move far on their own, these pests and diseases can be carried long distances on travelers firewood and start new infestations. Native tree species and planted fruit trees and shrubs lack defenses against these new pests and diseases. Infestations can destroy entire forests, lower property values, and cost millions of dollars to manage. \"It is often impossible to tell just by looking at the wood whether it is having devastating insects or diseases hitching a ride in or on it,\" said Gary Fish, State Horticulturist. Never assume wood that looks uninfested is safe to move. Important steps towards slowing the spread of invasive species we can all take are: 1) to realize that untreated firewood moved a long distance is a threat to trees and forests and 2) commit to using only local or certified heat-treated wood, said Allison Kanoti, State Entomologist. Bringing untreated firewood into the state is banned, but in a state as big as Maine, the commitment to use local or heat-treated wood needs to be applied to movement of firewood within the state as well. As camping resumes this year, DACF urges all campers to look to source firewood locally, rather than bring wood with you. Typically, the firewood sold by in-state vendors is affordable, locally sourced, or heat-treated to eliminate pests and diseases. The Firewood Scout website can help you find local firewood at [http://www.firewoodscout.org/](http://www.firewoodscout.org/) Limit the spread of invasive species, leave firewood at home and: - Use firewood certified as heat-treated; - Buy firewood at your destination or gather it on-site where permitted; and - Burn all wood on-site, and do not take any home or to a new location. DACF safeguards Maines natural resources against harmful insects and diseases through plant pest quarantines, which limit the movement of certain plant material within, into or out of the state. Over the last hundred years, invasive pests have killed tens of millions of trees in forests, cities, and communities across the country. Quarantines can help limit the movement of potentially infested wood, but everyone has to do their part to stop or slow the spread of invasive species.

LUPC Approves Petition to Terminate Concept Plan for the Moosehead Lake Region July 15, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 287-3156 AUGUSTA - Today, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Land Use Planning Commission (LUPC) approved a petition to terminate the Concept Plan for the Moosehead Lake Region and rezone the entire Resource Plan Protection (P-RP) Subdistrict currently applied to the approximately 380,074 acre Plan area. Due to unforeseen impacts from the economic recession of 2008-2009, none of the anticipated development has occurred. The Concept Plan area will be rezoned primarily to management and protection subdistricts, except for a 3-acre Recreational Facility Development zone to accommodate an existing sporting camp. The 363,000 acre Moosehead Region Conservation Easement, as well as certain other public benefits, including guaranteed public access, will remain in perpetuity. LUPC Land Use Guidance Maps, the petition and supporting documents, resource agency and stakeholder comments, LUPC staff documents, and other materials are available [online](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/lupc/plans_maps_data/resourceplans/moosehead_prp014.html). Next Steps Termination of the Concept Plan offers the community and the region an opportunity to choose future land uses on 16,910 acres previously designated for development. Community members have worked hard for over a decade to plan for the regions future. Their efforts include a regional branding and economic development plan, a community-based visioning project, designation of the Moosehead Lake Scenic Byway, community input on public access trails and conservation initiatives, and the Greenville Master Plan. A community planning process is just starting to engage the community in determining the future zoning for the region.

Governor Mills and DACF Commissioner Beal outline opportunities for Maine's Congressional Delegation to support the forest products industry July 24, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA - On Wednesday, Governor Mills and DACF Commissioner Beal, sent a letter to the Maine Congressional delegation outlining ways to support Maine's forest products industry. DACF is joining the National Association of State Foresters in urging congressional leaders, when assessing options for economic recovery, to ensure that forestry agencies can continue to provide ecological and economic benefits. Forestry contributes billions of dollars to the Maine economy and accounts for one out of every 20 jobs. The letter emphasizes the sector's critical importance to rural communities and focuses on forestry agencies' essential support and expertise. The full text of the letter is available below: The Honorable Susan Collins United States Senate 413 Dirksen Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 The Honorable Angus King United States Senate 133 Hart Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 The Honorable Chellie Pingree U.S. House of Representatives 2162 Rayburn House Office Building Washington, DC 20515 The Honorable Jared Golden U.S. House of Representatives 1223 Longworth HOB Washington, DC 20515 July 22, 2020 Re: Support for Critical State Forestry Needs Dear Senators Collins and King, and Representatives Pingree and Golden, Thank you for your continued support and engagement in the Maine forestry sector. Now, more than ever before, we must work together as state and federal officials to ensure the ongoing success of our natural resource industries. Maine's forest products industry contributes more than $8 billion to the Maine economy, and one out of every 20 jobs is associated with the forest products sector.[1] Nationwide, privately-owned forestland supports $2.4 million jobs, $98.7 billion in payroll, and $281 billion in timber sales and manufacturing shipments annually. Also, privately-owned forestlands contribute $81.3 billion, or 4.6% of the U.S.s total manufacturing GDP.[2] The pandemic has had devastating effects on the nations economy, including the Maine forestry sector, and has also negatively impacted the states forestry budget. Not only is forestry critical to rural economies, but it is also indispensable to the nations economic recovery. State forestry agencies are crucial links in the industrys supply chain. They provide critical support and expertise to our nations emergency response capacity for wildfire and other natural disasters. This support includes playing a central role in the states response to COVID-19. In addition, the forestry sector has been dramatically impacted by COVID-19 and needs both technical and financial support to ensure the ability to navigate through market disruptions and other challenges that affect its overall viability. The following are recommendations, which I fully endorse, from the National Association of State Foresters for an economic stimulus package to ensure state forestry agencies have the capacity to continue to support the forestry sector, the environment, local jobs, and economic recovery: Provide $500 Million with Maximum Flexibility for State and Private Forestry - Provide supplemental appropriations for State and Private Forestry (S&PF) appropriations or provide block grants to states with dedicated funding for state forestry agencies with three to five years in spending authority. Award funding either directly to the state agency or designated third-party partners (non-governmental organizations, local governments, etc.) approved by the state forester. - Provide maximum flexibility for S&PF spending authority or block grant funding to: - Allow states to retain employees, determine staffing levels for S&PF programs, and - Hire technical assistance foresters to build capacity to jump-start rural economies through forestry activities. - Focus S&PF dollars where they will provide the most support to the forestry sector, local economies and jobs, and overall economic recovery. - Waive or reduce state match requirements for three to five years to allow federal program implementation to continue even under state budget shortfalls. Stimulate Rural Economies by Supporting Forest Products Supply Chain - Support the American Loggers Councils proposal to provide a loan program for no less than 2.5 billion dollars for contractors who harvested/delivered wood to mills across the country in 2019. Additionally, my administration is in full support of the Loggers Relief Act, which would establish a new program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to provide direct payments to timber harvesting and hauling businesses that can demonstrate they have experienced significant economic hardship compared to the previous year. We appreciate your immediate attention to this vital issue and look forward to discussing these requests with your further. Sincerely, Governor Janet Mills Commissioner Amanda E.

Three separate on-farm milk samples taken in late June and early July detected PFOS at 12,700, 14,900, and 32,200 ppt. This farms milk was tested as a result of DACFs second round of state-wide retail milk testing for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This survey demonstrated that Maines retail milk supply continues to be safe for consumption, with nineteen of the 20 retail samples returning results that were below the laboratorys reporting limit of 25 ppt. DACF investigated one retail milk sample with a 65.7 ppt result, and, with cooperation from the milk processor, was able to trace the source directly back to the farm in central Maine. The farm is no longer producing milk for consumption and is not contributing to the milk supply. \"Our testing approach allows us to identify and investigate potential issues of concern before they can become a problem, so we can ensure that retail milk in Maine is safe,\" commented Amanda Beal, DACF Commissioner. At the same time, the State is committed to helping farmers who may be impacted by PFAS contamination to find a viable path forward to continue farming and producing products that are safe for people to consume. DACF and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) are investigating the potential source(s) of PFOS and other PFAS on the farm, including historical activities and site-specific attributes that might affect test results. Samples of livestock feed and water have already been collected and submitted for analysis. Additionally, because the farm produces beef, as a precautionary step, DACF has asked the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to develop a PFOS action threshold for beef. Once established, this action threshold will allow for on-farm testing to occur and further understanding of PFOS impacts in this arena. The farm may not currently sell its cattle or any beef products. DACF is working collaboratively to research, develop, and implement PFAS response strategies with other state and federal agencies, local governments, industry organizations, and other stakeholders. DACF is advocating for additional sources of federal funding and support to assist farmers who face financial hardship from lost production caused by PFAS contamination. DACF is conducting its next retail milk test this fall. About PFAS PFAS are a large group of human-made fluorinated chemicals that became widely used in household products and industrial settings as early as the 1950s. There are over 4,000 compounds that have been identified as PFAS to-date, including PFOS. [Learn more](https://www1.maine.gov/dep/spills/topics/pfas/index.html). Maine PFAS Task Force Since the Mills administration took office, Maine has moved to actively expand testing and monitoring for PFAS. In January 2020, the states PFAS Task Force, convened by Governor Mills during her first year in office, released its report to the Legislature. Decisive Task Force recommendations include protecting foods produced in Maine from PFAS adulteration through restrictions on PFAS uses, restrictions on the agronomic utilization and land application of PFAS-containing residuals, investigation and remediation of PFAS contamination, and expanded testing of agricultural produce and products grown and/or raised in soils where residuals have been agronomically utilized. All PFAS Task Force documents, including the Final Report, are available at [https://www.maine.gov/pfastaskforce.](https://www.maine.gov/pfastaskforce.) # Land Use Planning Commission accepts Wolfden zoning petition as complete for processing July 27, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 480-0558 AUGUSTA - The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Land Use Planning Commission (LUPC) has accepted the Wolfden Mt.

The United States Department of Agriculture's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service's Plant Protection and Quarantine Smuggling, Interdiction and Trade Compliance Unit is currently investigating this situation across the nation. About the mystery seeds - In Maine and across the US, people are reporting receiving unsolicited packages containing seeds. Recipients should hold onto the seeds and packaging, including the mailing label, and refer to this [form](https://www.Maine.gov/dacf/seeds). - While the exact types of seeds in the packages are unknown, the seeds are thought to possibly be either invasive or pose a plant health risk, and not believed to be harmful to humans or pets. The seeds could pose a significant risk to agriculture or the environment. - The seeds are usually sent in white packages displaying Chinese lettering and the words \"China Post.\" Most recipients say they did not order anything, and that the packaging was labeled as jewelry. Some recipients have reported ordering seeds on Amazon and receiving these seeds. - Recipients are asked to place the seeds and shipping envelope (if available) into a resealable baggie and mail them to the following address for identification and processing: USDA-APHIS-PPQ, 15 Iron Road, Suite 1, Hermon, ME 04401 # Bureau of Parks and Lands updates water access restrictions at Popham Beach and Reid State Parks July 31, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 480-0558 AUGUSTA -Earlier this week, in response to the fatal shark attack near Bailey Island, water activity restrictions took effect at Maine's coastal State Parks with beaches. Today, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Bureau of Parks and Lands (BPL) is limiting water access at the following beaches: - Popham Beach State Park and Reid State Park restricted to waist-deep water access (the lagoon at Reid State Park remains open). - Ferry Beach State Park and Crescent Beach State Park remain restricted to waist-deep water access. - All other coastal Maine State Parks are allowing regular water activity. The decision to increase water activity depth from ankle- and knee-deep at Popham Beach and Reid State Parks comes after consultation with the Maine Marine Patrol. State Park Rangers and lifeguards will continue to actively monitor for sharks and have the authority to clear the water should any concerns arise. On Wednesday, July 29, 2020, Popham Beach State Park lifeguards alerted the Department of Marine Resources (DMR) to a possible shark sighting. Maine Marine Patrol searched the area and did not see any sharks but spotted an ocean sunfish and seals feeding on fish. Maine Marine Patrol has fielded reported shark sightings following Monday's incident and there are no confirmed white shark sightings. BPL's current plan, assuming there is no confirmed shark activity in the vicinity of the Parks, is to return to regular swimming at all four Parks on Monday, August 3, 2020. Daily beach condition reports are posted to [social media](https://www.facebook.com/mainedacf/) and [online](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/water_activities/popham_beach_conditions.shtml). Bureau of Parks and Lands updates water activity restrictions at four coastal State Parks until further notice August 3, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 480-0558 AUGUSTA -Today, the Bureau of Parks and Lands (BPL) removed water activity restrictions at Popham, Ferry, and Crescent Beach State Parks. Water activities at Reid State Park remain limited to waist-deep, because of a lifeguard shortage. BPL thanks visitors for their continued understanding and cooperation. Maine State Park news and condition reports are regularly posted to [social media](https://www.facebook.com/mainedacf/) and [parksandlands.com](http://www.parksandlands.com). Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry asks for the public's help checking trees for invasive species during August August 5, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 480-0558 AUGUST - During August, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) are asking the public to take a couple of minutes to check trees in their communities and forests for invasive insects. August is the peak time of year to see adult wood-boring insects, and the activity of other invasive pests is also visible. \"Our first defense against invasive species is to prevent their arrival in the first place,\" State Horticulturist Gary Fish explained. Our partners at USDA APHIS and Customs and Border Protection here in the US and Canadian Food Inspection Agency north of the border frequently stop plant pests before they can gain a foothold in North America. However, the volume of trade and travel prevents them from stopping every pest. Invasive species are non-native organisms that include plants, animals, and diseases. When introduced to a new environment, they lack natural predators or diseases to keep their populations in check. They are considered invasive when they harm the environment, the economy, and/or human health. Examples of those already impacting Maine's Forests are numerous. Maine State Forester Patty Cormier recognized the importance of public involvement in protecting our trees from invasive species. Trees play an important role in our state economy and provide environmental benefits, including clean air and water and wildlife habitat and recreation opportunities. The public, our most important partner in detecting invasive species, is our eyes on the ground. We can avoid tree-loss from invasive species by stopping the spread of these pests. What to look for State officials urge the public to be especially aware of four invasive species during their tree checks. - Asian longhorn beetle - this large (>1) black and white beetle has a taste for maples and other hardwood or broad-leaved trees. Look for the oval to round wounds on the bark where the females have chewed out a site to deposit eggs, round holes in the trunks and branches of trees, and piles of coarse sawdust at the base of trees. [Learn more](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/ALB/index.shtml) - Emerald ash borer this small (<1/2) metallic green beetle is deadly for ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees. Look for small (1/8) D-shaped adult exit holes in the bark, winding frass-filled (sawdust-like waste) feeding galleries under the bark, woodpecker feeding, crown dieback, and epicormic shoots. Emerald ash borer has been found in two parts of Maine: York and Cumberland Counties in the south and northwestern Aroostook County in the north. [Learn more](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/index.shtml) - Oak wilt disease this deadly fungal disease of oaks is found in other parts of the United States, including the closest known infestations in New York State. Look for sudden wilt in red oak group (pointed lobes on leaves) trees during summer months. [Learn more](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/index.htm) - Spotted lanternfly this colorful planthopper is an expert hitchhiker with a broad appetite. Best known for its impacts on grapes and hops, spotted lanternfly feeds on and can damage a wide variety of plants. Look for the brightly colored nymphs and adults but be aware that this insect hitches a ride most subtly as dull-colored egg masses. Like the infamous gypsy moth, the adult lays its eggs on just about anything that is still long enough. [Learn more](//www.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=860e68f67bab402ca2f8d0ae22a1112a) Were asking people to take 10 minutes to search the trees in their yards, neighborhoods, and forests, Cormier said. If you find a suspected invasive pest, take a picture and send us information at bugwatch@maine.gov. Its quick and easy and will connect you with an expert who can help. The photographs should show enough detail that an expert can verify or determine if follow-up is needed. It can be helpful to include an object, such as a coin or pencil, for scale. If it is an insect, try to capture it in case a photo is not enough. Otherwise, make sure you can find the affected tree again if needed. Captured insects can be stored in hard containers in a cool place. Most will survive in the refrigerator long enough to receive a response from the department. Take Simple Actions to Prevent Spread There are simple actions that anyone can take to avoid introducing and spreading invasive insects. - Buy firewood where youll burn it or gather it on site when permitted. When moving firewood, you might also be moving invasive insects and diseases hiding there. - When traveling locally or moving to a new area, check your bags and boxes to make sure they are insect-free. Invasive species can get in and on bags, boxes, vehicles and other items that have been stored outside or in your garage. We all have a role to play in preventing invasive species movement, State Horticulturist Fish said. Taking just a few minutes to check the trees in your yard can go a long way to ensuring that the forests and trees we rely on now are here for future generations.

Governor Mills Encourages Maine's Congressional Delegation to Help Towns Conserve Land & Support Economic Growth Through Land and Water Conservation Fund August 24, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov Governor also thanks Maine Congressional Delegation for their support of the Great American Outdoors Act AUGUSTA - In a letter sent today, Governor Janet Mills urged Maine's Congressional Delegation to help Maine municipalities more easily conserve and protect lands for generations to come and to support economic growth through the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). The Governor, highlighting the economic and public health benefits of outdoor recreation and land preservation, underscored LWCF's importance in Maine but noted that many municipalities, especially in rural Maine, will have difficulty meeting LWCFs required 50 percent match given budget constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governor Mills encouraged the Congressional Delegation to address these concerns by reducing the state-required match to 25 percent and by requesting the National Park Service set aside 10 percent of LWCF annually to support stateside management and ongoing stewardship. \"LWCF has played a vital role in Maine, providing more than 43 million dollars for our local and State Parks and recreation areas. The program has also supported sites of national significance such as Acadia National Park and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. Since its inception, LWCF has helped support nearly 900 projects across Maine,\" wrote Governor Mills. The body of evidence continues to grow related to the significant and positive impact outdoor recreation plays in Maine and across the nation. Maine Outdoor Brands, the alliance of brands, non-profits, and business leaders raising awareness of Maine's outdoor recreation economy, reports that outdoor recreation contributes 3 billion dollars to our economy. Living or working within 20 minutes of a park or trail increases by over 40 percent a person's likelihood of visiting that park, and people that live or work near parks and trails are much more likely to have increased levels of physical activity, which improves health outcomes. The physical and emotional benefits of outdoor recreation are even more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. Visitation at State Parks has pushed many of them to capacity and our parks and public lands form the foundation of our tourism and outdoor recreation economy. he Governor also extended her gratitude to the Delegation for their robust support of the Great American Outdoors Act, which was signed into law earlier this month and guarantees full and permanent funding of LWCF. The program is administered at the federal level by the National Park Service and in Maine by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Bureau of Parks and Lands. LWCF, which is funded by oil and gas lease revenues, was established in 1964 to assist federal, state, and local governments in the acquisition and development of public outdoor recreation facilities. LWCF grants can provide up to 50 percent of the allowable costs for approved acquisition and development projects for public outdoor recreation.

As you know, LWCF, which is funded by oil and gas lease revenues, was established in 1964 to assist federal, state, and local governments in the acquisition and development of public outdoor recreation facilities. Administered at the federal level by the National Park Service and by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Bureau of Parks and Lands at the state level, LWCF grants can provide up to 50 percent of the costs for the acquisition and development of projects for public outdoor recreation. LWCF has played a vital role in Maine, providing more than 43 million dollars for our local and State Parks and recreation areas. The program has also supported sites of national significance such as Acadia National Park and the Appalachian National Scenic Trail. Since its inception, LWCF has helped support nearly 900 projects across Maine.

Living or working within 20 minutes of a park or trail increases by over 40 percent a person's likelihood of visiting that park, and people that live or work near parks and trails are much more likely to have increased levels of physical activity, which improves health outcomes. The physical and emotional benefits of outdoor recreation are even more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. Visitation at State Parks has pushed many of them to capacity and our parks and public lands form the foundation of our tourism and outdoor recreation economy. As LWCF continues to help secure valuable recreational assets, the long-term sustainable support required of state-level program management is especially important. As you know, the pandemic is causing enormous budget pressures at all levels of government. Throughout Maine meeting the required 50 percent match for LWCF funding is extremely challenging. To address these concerns, we recommend the following amendments through the next CARES Act relief bill, appropriations, or a stand alone legislation. - Request that the National Park Service provide an annual 10 percent apportionment to program administration, to support stateside program management and ongoing stewardship obligations. - Reduce the state-required match to 25 percent to serve as a form of economic stimulus for local communities. We greatly appreciate your leadership on this vital issue and look forward to continuing to work with each of your offices on finding the best path forward for these recommended requests. Sincerely, Janet T. Mills Governor Cc: Amanda E. Beal, Commissioner, Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry USDA Approves Maine Hemp Production Plans September 3, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA - On Wednesday, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved Maine's hemp production plans. With the approval, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) assumes primary regulatory responsibility for hemp production within its jurisdiction, under the oversight of the USDA Domestic Hemp Production Program. \"Hemp is becoming an important part of Maine's agriculture sector. Approval of our hemp production plan means Maine's growers will have certainty about the expectations and guidelines for hemp cultivation for the coming years,\" commented DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. Because Maine allows for hemp production under existing state law, the Department must act to reconcile the differences between its existing program and the Interim Final Rule during the upcoming January 2021 legislative session. The statutory changes and subsequent rulemaking will authorize hemp production and provide the Department with the authority needed to regulate hemp production in a manner consistent with the 2018 Farm Bill and the USDA's Interim Final Rule that establishes the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program. Maine's hemp program has been in place since 2016, beginning with one grower who harvested seed from less than an acre. Today the program includes 110 outdoor licenses and 362 licensed acres of planted Hemp and seven indoor grower licenses, with over 22,700 licensed square feet planted. Hemp is grown in every one of Maine's 16 counties, and the varieties grown thrive in all parts of the state. # Grant cycle open for Land and Water Conservation Fund September 3, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov Communities intending to submit grant applications are required to request Maine's pre-approval site inspection by October 31, 2020 AUGUSTA - The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) 2020-2021 grant cycle is open and accepting applications for acquiring public land, developing recreation facilities, and renovation of existing outdoor recreation facilities from eligible applicants. Qualified applicants must [request](//docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8Nki6gDDnPAsFdlfGJjbFBIPGyTB01JtDYlWmIae3axzfBA/viewform) a pre-approval site inspection by October 31, 2020, at 11:59 p.m. If the proposed project is approved for application, the project sponsor will be encouraged to submit a complete application packet by the end of May 2021. The grant application and support documents are posted [online](//www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/grants/land_water_conservation_fund.html). The maximum grant award for this round will be $500,000. There is currently no minimum award level, but applicants considering a request of $20,000 or less should discuss their project ideas with the grant manager before applying. The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1964 (LWCF) was established to assist federal, state, and local governments acquiring and developing public outdoor recreation facilities. Administered at the federal level by the National Park Service and at the state level by the Bureau of Parks and Lands, LWCF grants can provide up to 50% of the allowable costs for approved acquisition or development projects for public outdoor recreation.

The Obsolete Pesticides Collection Program has kept more than 109 tons of pesticides out of the waste stream since its start in 1982. This free annual program is open to homeowners, family-owned farms and greenhouses. Collections will occur at four sites: Presque Isle, Bangor, Augusta, and Portland. Participants must pre-register by October 9, 2020. Drop-ins are not permitted. Collected pesticides are taken to an out-of-state disposal facility licensed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. Information to register and fill out your obsolete pesticide inventory form may be found under \"Resources\" on the BPC website: [www.thinkfirstspraylast.org](//www.thinkfirstspraylast.org). Pesticides accepted include: herbicides, insecticides, rodenticides, fungicides and similar products used in agricultural production or around the home. Past participants in the program have reported finding obsolete pesticides in barns of family properties, garages of newly purchased homes and other unexpected places. While removal of these pesticides can seem daunting, it is important for the protection of public, wildlife and environmental health, that they are dealt with properly and not thrown in the trash or poured down the drain, where they can contaminate land and water resources. \"The Obsolete Pesticide Collection Program is an excellent opportunity for free disposal of unusable and unwanted pesticides,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. Register in advance, bring your pesticides to one of the designated collection sites, and let the professionals dispose of these materials responsibly and safely. DEP Acting Commissioner Melanie Loyzim encourages Mainers to take full advantage of this free opportunity. When improperly disposed ofin the trash, poured into the environment, down the drain, or kept in storage for long periodspesticides threaten wildlife and the quality of our drinking water sources, Loyzim said. - More information about Maine Board of Pesticides Control can be found at [thinkfirstspraylast.org](//thinkfirstspraylast.org). - More information about [Maine Department of Environmental Protection](//www.maine.gov/dep/index.html). # Five Community Resilience Projects Receive Maine Coastal Community Grants September 17, 2020 For more information contact: Ruta Dzenis at: Ruta.Dzenis@maine.gov AUGUSTA - Today, the Maine Department of Agriculture Conservation and Forestry (DACF) announced the award of $151,976 from its Coastal Community Grant Program for five community resilience projects located throughout coastal Maine. Coastal Community Grants are an important element of the Municipal Planning Assistance Program's mission to foster innovative and effective land use management approaches by providing technical and financial assistance to Maine municipalities. \"Coastal Community Grants help fund needed adaptation planning,\" commented Amanda Beal, DACF Commissioner. The five selected projects are tackling issues Maine communities are facing today and raising awareness of future potential risks.\" Coastal Community Grant funding is made possible by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, through Maines federal coastal zone management award to the Maine Coastal Program at the Department of Marine Resources. Each project involves regional or local-level partnerships, and each grantee provides a minimum of 25% in matching funds or services. This years grants support critical resiliency planning efforts in coastal Maine communities, said Ruta Dzenis of DACFs Municipal Planning Assistance Program, which administers the grants. This was the tenth round of the grant program, which since 2012, has provided $2.03 million for 74 projects in coastal Maine. Fiscal year 2021 grants were awarded to the following projects: City of Gardiner Downtown Master Plan Reinforcing the Citys Connection to Nature The City of Gardiners historic downtown is located on the banks of the Kennebec River at its confluence with Cobbosseecontee Stream, where chronic flooding and erosion damage to property and roads are becoming more frequent. This project will expand on an earlier multi-agency collaborative effort to provide detailed planning and recommendations for flood and storm mitigation. Town of Phippsburg Collaboration to Increase Social Resilience in Midcoast Maine Municipal, emergency response, social service, and conservation providers will take part in a scenario planning exercise that simulates a coastal hazard event in the southern Midcoast region. The exercise will be designed to highlight opportunities for the sectors to coordinate more effectively to address 'social vulnerability in their planning for the impacts of and recovery from coastal hazards. Town of Waldoboro Septic System Vulnerability Assessment Guidance Document Development and Case Study The goals of this project are: (1) to develop a formal guidance document which will provide coastal communities with a clear and effective roadmap for assessing and prioritizing septic system vulnerability; (2) to complete a thorough septic system vulnerability assessment for coastal parcels in the Town of Waldoboro to continue to improve water quality in the Medomak River and sustain the shellfish community. Southern Maine Planning and Development Commission Developing A Model Coastal Resilience Ordinance to Protect Maines Coastal Cities, Towns and Residents This project will engage one city and four towns that are representative of communities along the Maine coast, and their varied social demographics, geography, and exposure to coastal risks, to develop a model coastal resilience ordinance based on the needs and goals of the municipalities. Southern Maine Planning and Development Commission Development of Checklist and Technical Standards for Erosion and Sediment Control Plans for Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) communities Maine communities which are subject to the General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate Storm Water Systems (MS4) will soon be required to standardize technical requirements for Sediment and Erosion Control Plans to come into compliance with updated permit requirements. This project will help 19 coastal communities achieve the new MS4 permit requirements, and provide much needed guidance for design, construction, and inspection of development projects. # Autumn is an excellent time to plant native trees, Maine Forest Service experts say September 18, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA - The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's (DACF) Maine Forest Service (MFS) remind everyone that fall is an ideal time of year to plant native trees. \"Because it takes approximately six weeks for roots to get established, the general rule for tree planting during fall is to get them in the ground by Indigenous Peoples Day,\" said Aaron Bergdahl, MFS Forest Pathologist. Roots need time to establish and cold weather and frozen ground shuts down root growth, and the soil temperature needs to be at least 55, at a 6-inch depth. Some trees do better than others when planted at the growing seasons end. In general, plants with shallow, fibrous root systems do better with fall planting than those with a deep taproot. Planting trees in early September provides enough time for root growth and establishment at the new site before soil temperatures drop and trees enter their dormancy period. This prepares trees for a head start on vigorous growth in the spring, said Bergdahl. Tips for fall planting - Dont prune newly planted trees- pruning newly planted trees and shrubs encourage top growth instead of root growth, where it is needed most. - Whenever you decide to plant trees in your yard, make sure you put the [right tree in the right place](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/policy_management/project_canopy/resources/right_tree_right_place.html). Trees that grow 80-100 tall dont belong under power lines, and, likely, a weeping willow or river birch wont be happy in that hot, dry corner of your yard. - When choosing what type of tree to plant, the MFS recommends looking into whether the tree is likely to become a problem in natural areas in the future by consulting the [advisory list from the DACF's Maine Natural Areas program](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/features/invasive_plants/invsheets.htm). Be aware that some species on the advisory list are also illegal to import, export, buy, sell, or intentionally propagate such as Norway and amur maple, tree-of-heaven and princess tree. The ban includes all cultivars, varieties and hybrids of these plants. - Research what will be needed to maintain the tree in the landscape. Some trees, such as true ashes, will require frequent insecticide treatments as emerald ash borer spreads. Several sites have excellent information that sums up some of these considerations for different species. If you dont find the information on the species you wish to plant, ask our experts. - Several handy tools exist to assist in selecting the best tree for any landscape: Morton Arboretum [Tree Selector](https://www.mortonarb.org/trees-plants/tree-and-plant-advice/tree-species-list/filters), Arbor Day Foundation Best Tree Finder: [Tree Wizard](https://www.arborday.org/shopping/trees/treewizard/GetZip.cfm)and [iTree Species Selector](https://species.itreetools.org/selector/) - Trees are an easy and inexpensive way to save energy, clean your air and water, increase your property value, and improve your familys well-being. [Properly planting](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/policy_management/project_canopy/resources/plant_a_tree.html)the right tree in the right place can bring you decades of enjoyment. # USDA Declares Aroostook County a Drought Disaster Area September 21, 2020 For more information contact: Tom Gordon at: Tom.Gordon@maine.gov Farmers impacted by current drought conditions encouraged to contact the USDA Farm Service Center for assistance and take advantage of important financial assistance programs and resources designed to help producers recover from production and physical losses AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation & Forestry (DACF) is encouraging Maine farmers to contact their local [USDA Farm Service Center](//offices.sc.egov.usda.gov/locator/app?state=me&agency=fsa) for drought assistance. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue recently designated Aroostook County as a drought disaster area, making farm operators in Aroostook and its four contiguous counties, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, and Washington, eligible for emergency assistance from the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Farmers in eligible counties have eight months from the date of a Secretarial disaster declaration to apply for [emergency loans](//www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/farm-loan-programs/emergency-farm-loans/index). FSA considers each emergency loan application on its own merits, considering the extent of production losses on the farm and the operator's security and repayment ability. The drought disaster declaration may be expanded to other counties if drought conditions persist. A [Secretarial Disaster Designation](//www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/FactSheets/emergency_disaster_designation_declaration_process-factsheet.pdf) is triggered for severe drought through a fast track process when a county meets the D2 (Severe Drought) drought level for eight consecutive weeks or a higher drought intensity value for any length. Secretarial Disaster Designations immediately trigger the availability of low-interest FSA [Emergency (EM) loans](//www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/FactSheets/2019/emergency-loan-program.pdf) to eligible producers in all primary and contiguous counties. EM loan funds may be used to: - Restore or replace essential property; - Pay all or part of production costs associated with the disaster year; - Pay essential family living expenses; - Reorganize the farming operation; and - Refinance certain debts. DACF also encourages farmers to plan for future drought conditions by upgrading their water supplies and improving their soils. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) provides technical assistance for agricultural water management plans, farm ponds, and irrigation systems. Soil health practices such as composting, cover crops, and reduced tillage can improve soil moisture-holding capacity. Farmers should contact their [local Soil & Water Conservation District](//www.maine.gov/dacf/about/commissioners/soil_water/index.shtml) or local NRCS Service Center for assistance and recommendations on soil health practices. Drought Assistance for Livestock and Crops Farmers in need of hay for their livestock can search the University of Maine Cooperative Extension's Hay Directory for sources of hay or straw. Farmers with excess hay are encouraged to post availability with the Extension Hay Directory Form. The following FSA Farm Programs automatically trigger once the county has been at D2 drought status for eight consecutive weeks or immediately upon hitting D3 status for any length of time, as reported weekly by the [U.S. Drought Monitor](//droughtmonitor.unl.edu): [Livestock Forage Program (LFP)](//www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/FactSheets/livestock_forage_program_lfp-fact_sheet.pdf)- provides payments to livestock producer for grazing losses [Emergency Livestock Assistance Program (ELAP)](//www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/farm-loan-programs/emergency-farm-loans/index)- provides financial assistance to livestock producers for losses resulting from the additional cost of transporting water to livestock due to an eligible drought [Emergency Conservation Program (ECP)](//www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/FactSheets/emergency-conservation-program-ecp-fact_sheet.pdf)provides cost-share to provide emergency water during periods of severe drought (specifically for grazing and confined livestock and existing irrigation systems for orchards and vineyards) The [Non-insurable Crop Assistance Program (NAP)](//www.fsa.usda.gov/Assets/USDA-FSA-Public/usdafiles/FactSheets/noninsured_crop_disaster_assistance_program-nap-fact_sheet.pdf) - acts like crop insurance but is for non-insurable crops and covers drought-related losses. In this case, the crop loss acts as the trigger for the program. Farmers called upon to respond to MEMA's Dry Well Survey Recently, the Maine Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) launched an on-line [Dry Well Survey](//survey123.arcgis.com/share/49fef6c94fd34a6a9804175ae4a3ad93?portalUrl=https://maine.maps.arcgis.com) to assist the State Drought Task Force in assessing the impacts of the drought. Anyone wishing to complete the survey without internet access can call 2-1-1.

Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Announces Plans for a Virtual 2021 Maine Agricultural Trades Show September 29, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: (207) 480-0558 AUGUSTA - The Maine Agricultural Trades Show (ATS) will be held as a virtual event in January 2021. The announcement comes after the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF), which organizes and runs the ATS, assessed the public health and financial risks associated with planning to host an in-person event. Although the event would take place a few months from now, the ability to gather together is still likely to be limited to a level that is much lower than the number of people who would regularly attend the ATS. DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal and Bureau of Agriculture Director Nancy McBrady explained the Department's decision in a letter emailed to farmers, producers, and business owners who annually rely upon the event for everything from new product sales and networking to continuing education, conferences, and certifications. \"Maine's agriculture sector continues to adjust to the pandemic,\" said Director McBrady. \"We know our farmers and producers would value the opportunity to gather together in preparation for the 2021 season, and for many, the Trades Show is an annual kick-off event for the year. But ultimately, the health and wellbeing of our community takes precedence.\" By holding the event virtually, farmers, service providers, vendors, and the general public will still be able to celebrate agriculture in Maine while accessing important and timely resources and information. \"We are looking forward to working with stakeholders to make sure our virtual Agricultural Trades Show delivers high-quality results,\" said Commissioner Beal. \"With the ingenuity and innovation that both our agricultural community and our staff in the Department embodies, I am certain we will be able to put on a dynamic, interactive, educational, and informative virtual event.\" Beal and McBrady invited past attendees, industry members, and all members of the agriculture community, to complete an [online survey](//forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=q6g_QX0gYkubzeoajy-GTpKAGylxidBNuLGMizCr__5UOVpXUTJLRkdLU0FQTjEyT0s1VjVPTUlKQS4u) to help DACF design the best online model for virtual meetings, webinars, training sessions, and more. Survey responses are requested by October 16, 2020. About the Maine Agricultural Trades Show A tradition since 1941, DACF's Maine Agricultural Trades Show is where the state's agricultural community convenes to celebrate farming, network, and plan for the coming season. Organized and hosted by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, the show provides access to resources that empower farmers and rural communities. Typically, over 100 exhibitors and dozens of conference sessions are part of this show, attracting agricultural producers, educators, exhibitors, businesses, and others to celebrate farming, exchange best practices, and explore farming products, equipment, and services. The show is free and open to the public and is an excellent opportunity for all ages to experience Maine's dynamic agriculture industry. The full text of the letter is available below: September 29, 2020 Dear Friends: From shifting to online sales to going virtual for Open Farm Day, and from adjusting to socially distanced farmers' markets to embracing new guidance for U-Pick operations, this has been a year of firsts for Maine agriculture. Farmers are adapting and meeting the challenges presented by the pandemic, and we anticipate that more changes and more creative thinking are needed as we enter 2021. This change includes our approach to traditional events, such as the Agricultural Trades Show. Because of continued risks to public health and the financial risks associated with planning to host an in-person event, we will not be able to hold the Trades Show as a face-to-face event in January 2021 and instead plan a Virtual Agricultural Trades Show. Though we cannot gather in person, we can still celebrate the resilience of our agricultural community and support the businesses that rely upon this annual event because of the value it creates. For eight decades, the Agricultural Trades Show has been the gathering place for agricultural producers, educators, exhibitors, businesses, and others to celebrate farming, exchange best practices, and explore farming products, equipment, and services. The Department recognizes that during the depths of Maines cold winter, the Trades Show is a vibrant gathering for producers, agricultural groups and associations, Department staff, and others to socialize and learn together. The decision to not hold the Trades Show as an in-person event is difficult, but one we must make now in the best interests of our agricultural community, both to protect everyones health and to provide advance notice of the need to pivot to a virtual format. Because so many of us rely on the show to promote products and services, host annual meetings, receive credits, and hear updates about departmental programs and more, we want to create an online model for virtual meetings, webinars, and training presentations. In creating the Virtual Agricultural Trades Show, the Department wants to hear from you. What would you most like to see and participate in during the virtual event? What are the technical needs of agricultural groups to robustly participate in the online venue? Are there promotional opportunities that would be beneficial? To help answer these questions and solicit feedback, the Department invites everyone to provide their ideas and suggestions by emailing acfagtradesshow@maine.gov or [completing this survey](//forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=q6g_QX0gYkubzeoajy-GTpKAGylxidBNuLGMizCr__5UOVpXUTJLRkdLU0FQTjEyT0s1VjVPTUlKQS4u). This direct feedback will help determine our next steps. We will be sure to communicate the Departments plans for the Virtual Agricultural Trades Show as they develop. This past year has been extremely challenging, and uncertainty still lies ahead. While disappointed not to be able to convene in-person in January, it is the Departments goal to provide Maine farmers and producers with the tools and information necessary to prepare for the 2021 farm season and to facilitate information exchange. We look forward to creating a dynamic and engaging Virtual Agricultural Trades Show to meet these goals. Sincerely, Amanda Beal, Commissioner Nancy McBrady, Director, Bureau of Agriculture, Food & Rural Resources Invasive Spotted Lanternfly Egg Masses Found in Maine September 29, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov No Live Spotted Lanternflies Found AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agricultural, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) today announced finding egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) on trees in Maine communities and is urging residents to report any sign of the invasive pest. The egg masses were found on trees from Pennsylvania, where SLF is established and planted in Boothbay, Freeport, Northeast Harbor, and Yarmouth. DACF urges anyone who received goods or materials, such as plants, landscaping materials, or outdoor furniture, from a state with a known SLF infestation to carefully check the materials, including any packaging, for signs of SLF. There are currently known populations of SLF in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. If any life stages of SLF are found, residents should take a photo or collect the specimen and report any pest potential sightings to bugwatch@maine.gov. Residents should look for large, gray insects, about one inch long, with black spots and red underwings, or inch-long, rectangular yellowish-brown egg masses covered with a gray waxy coating. Egg masses may be found on any flat surface. \"These most recent finds call attention to the fact that there are many ways that spotted lanternfly can travel here from other states,\" said State Horticulturist, Gary Fish. Early detection plays an important role in the protection of our state's economic and ecological resources from invasive species, and we ask anyone who may have received shipments of wood, ornamental plants, or any other materials from Pennsylvania or other Northeastern states to help protect the natural resources and agricultural industries of Maine by checking for and reporting any signs of spotted lanternfly. The spotted lanternfly (Lycorma delicatula) is an invasive sap-feeding insect from Asia first found in the United States in 2014, in Pennsylvania. While the preferred host plant of this pest is tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), spotted lanternfly attacks over 100 species of trees, shrubs, and vines, and has the potential to impact a broad range of agricultural commodities, including apples, peaches, grapes/wine, maple syrup, as well as the ornamental nursery industry. As many families across the state spend more time at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and are undertaking activities such as gardening to improve their outdoor spaces, Maine has seen an increase in purchases of items such as outdoor furniture, play structures, gazebos, as well as trees and shrubs for landscaping. When shipped from areas with SLF infestations, these products, and the vehicles used for transportation, can unintentionally carry the pest into new areas. Because no live SLF has been found in Maine, there is currently no evidence that SLF has become established. The DACF Horticulture Program has inspected all the suspect trees and asks the homeowners and landscape companies to keep an eye on the areas where egg masses were found to confirm that no live populations are present. Spotted lanternfly has not previously been found in Maine. [More information about the spotted lanternfly](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/slf/index.shtml). If you have seen any of the life stages of this insect in Maine, please report it: [bugwatch@maine.gov](mailto:bugwatch@maine.gov). Supporting documents New Signs Warn of Dangers of Out-of-State Firewood October 1, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA - The installation of the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) high-visibility road signage is underway. The sign's message \"FIREWOOD ALERT - TRANSPORTING FIREWOOD INTO MAINE IS BANNED\" (photos follow) is intended to protect against the incursion of new pests like Asian longhorned beetle, oak wilt or beech leaf disease and the further spread of emerald ash borer (EAB), hemlock woolly adelgid, and other forest pests and diseases. DACF worked with the Maine Department of Transportation (MeDOT) on the signs' production and installation. The project was funded by a Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \"Invasive threats not yet found in Maine as well as those already in Maine like the emerald ash borer and hemlock woolly adelgid are killing trees in Maine and many nearby states,\" commented Gary Fish, State Horticulturalist. \"DACF's mission with these signs is to educate everyone entering and traveling around Maine, that out of state firewood is banned, and moving firewood within our state threatens to worsen the devastating impact of invasive pests and diseases on our forests.\" \"We hear it all the time, people pack firewood thinking theirs is safe,\" said Allison Kanoti, State Entomologist. \"But the truth is, they could be moving destructive pests to new homes in our forests and that should be an unacceptable risk to take.\" Unfortunately, the decision to move firewood can wind up costing a whole lot more than a bundle of firewood. It can even jeopardize the very reasons people spend time at a place, such as excellent wildlife habitat, rivers and lakes with clean water, or forested vistas. Maine residents should also heed the message to use local or heat-treated firewood. Pests like browntail moth and emerald ash borer can be spread to new places within the state in and on untreated firewood. The first of 15 signs went up in Calais in September and installation is containing in conjunction with MeDOT projects. Travelers entering Maine will encounter new DACF signage at these locations: Berwick and So. Lebanon, Madawaska, and Porter. Help DACF protect Maine's forests - Leave firewood at home - use local Maine firewood - If you have already transported firewood into Maine, burn it. Please do not leave it or bring it home. - If you can't burn it all within 24 hours, bring it to the [nearest drop-off site](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/firewood.shtml#dropoff). - Burn local or heat-treated firewood.

Supporting documents Commissioner Beal Requests USDA Support for Timber Harvesting and Hauling Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic October 5, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA - In a letter sent last week, Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) Commissioner Amanda Beal requested assistance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in helping to prevent Maine loggers and log truckers from falling through the gaps of the federal government's COVID-19 economic relief programs. In the letter, addressed to USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue, the Commissioner highlighted the critically important role loggers and log haulers play in our forest products industry. They also point to the damaging impact mill closures and business curtailments are having on Maines economy. \"Loggers and log haulers are critical to Maines forest products industry, contributing over $620 million annually to the Maine economy in addition to 9,000 jobs and $342 million in labor income. Maines loggers and truckers support the harvest of the raw material that contributes over $8 billion in value-added wood and paper product manufacturing annually,\" wrote Commissioner Beal. In the last six months and extending through the end of the year, Maine mill closures and curtailments will lead to a 30 percent reduction in harvesting capacity and the layoff of nearly 1,000 people in harvesting and hauling. Over 11,000 truckloads of wood will not be delivered to a Maine mill in 2020. For an industry that contributes over $620 million of economic impact each year, this means a direct loss of over $186 million of economic activity. We know that similar impacts have occurred to loggers and haulers from other forest products states, but Maine has been hit especially hard. Commissioner Beals letter acknowledges the importance of the U.S. Small Business Administrations Payroll Protection Program for companies and employees in Maine, but stresses the need for more direct support Maines small, family-owned logging businesses. The full text of the letter is available below: October 2, 2020 Secretary Sonny Perdue United States Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Avenue, S.W. Whitten Building, Room 200-A Washington, DC, 20250 RE: Support for Timber Harvesting and Hauling Professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic Dear Secretary Perdue, Maine loggers and log haulers are slipping through the cracks of the federal governments COVID-19 economic relief programs. I am writing to request the Departments assistance in helping prevent this. Failing to act will threaten the livelihoods of thousands of hardworking forestry professionals here in the state. The USDA is uniquely positioned to provide relief to the many loggers and truckers whose operations have been seriously harmed by the effects of the pandemic. Loggers and log haulers are critical to Maines forest products industry, contributing over $620 million annually to the Maine economy in addition to 9,000 jobs and $342 million in labor income. Maines loggers and truckers support the harvest of the raw material that contributes over $8 billion in value-added wood and paper product manufacturing annually. Their work is so important that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security identified the forest products workforce [1] as essential during the COVID-19 response. This vital workforce is hurting. Maine loggers are reporting losses of 40-50 percent this year. The negative impacts of the pandemic began in February as a result of reduced export capability, and they have steadily worsened. In mid-March, COVID-19 crashed lumber markets as housing starts ground to a halt. In the months since, paper mills across the state have shut down for periods of time or drastically cut output in response to reduced global paper consumption. In the last six months and extending through the end of the year, Maine mill closures and curtailments will lead to a 30 percent reduction in harvesting capacity and the layoff of nearly 1,000 people in harvesting and hauling. Over 11,000 truckloads of wood will not be delivered to a Maine mill in 2020. For an industry that contributes over $620 million of economic impact each year, this means a direct loss of over $186 million of economic activity. We know that similar impacts have occurred to loggers and haulers from other forest products states, but Maine has been hit especially hard. Unfortunately, the federal programs designed to help businesses cope with the pandemics impact have provided limited benefits to loggers and log haulers. Although the Payroll Protection Program has undeniably been a lifeline for hundreds of companies and their employees in our state, it does not account for the high cost of machinery that small, family-owned logging businesses must pay for on a monthly basis. The Maine forest industry needs immediate support, and I strongly urge the USDA to consider providing direct relief to loggers and truckers by utilizing new or existing programs under the USDAs purview in order to help this iconic Maine industry. The Coronavirus Food Assistant Program (CFAP) is one example of an existing program that could be expanded or used as a model for direct relief to loggers and haulers. Notably, producers of maple syrup, wool, cut flowers, aloe leaves, and upland cotton have all been granted CFAP eligibility; loggers and haulers have not. Additionally, we ask that the USDA look at other existing programs within USDAs Rural Development, such as the Wood Innovation Grant program, which could also serve as a model for additional and immediate grant and loan programs. Without such critical support, we fear that some producers will have to cease operations, and if they do, they will not return in the future, putting the entire forest products economy at risk. Sincerely, Amanda E. Beal Commissioner [1] Workers who support the manufacture and distribution of forest products, including, but not limited to timber, paper, and other wood products.

DACF staff recently confirmed the first known Maine location of this severely invasive plant at a nursery in York County. Previously, the closest known locations for stiltgrass were at nurseries in New Hampshire. \"We knew it was likely that this invasive plant would make its way to Maine eventually,\" said Gary Fish, State Horticulturist. \"It is a severely invasive plant with small seeds that can hitchhike on plant root balls, potted plants, soil, gravel, or equipment.\" Stiltgrass forms dense colonies in sun or shade, invading the forest and forming a thick thatch layer over time. The thatch layer makes it difficult for native trees, shrubs, and wildflower seeds to establish and grow. Thatch buildup also raises fire risk. Stiltgrass is an annual plant, and each stem can produce hundreds to thousands of seeds before dying in the fall. Seeds survive for at least five years in the soil. Nancy Olmstead, an Invasive Plant Biologist with MNAP, urges landowners to search recently disturbed areas for new infestations of stiltgrass. \"It's imperative to be on the lookout for this plant. We have to work together to locate any additional sites and keep stiltgrass from invading Maine's priceless forests and natural areas.\" Landowners, land managers, and nursery professionals should be on the lookout for any dense patches of unfamiliar grass that could be stiltgrass. Several features of stiltgrass can help distinguish it from other grasses: - Leaves of stiltgrass alternate along the stem, 2-4\" long and \" wide, and have a stripe of reflective hairs along the leaf midrib on the leaf's top surface. Individual hairs may be too small to see with the naked eye, but the pale stripe along the leaf midrib is distinctive. The midrib may be slightly off-center. - The leaf edges and surfaces feel smooth to the touch, unlike some native grasses with stiff hairs along the leaf edge. - The common name \"stiltgrass\" comes from the plant's growth habit: it trails along the ground, branching from nodes where it produces \"stilts\" (roots) to support the new branches. It is shallow-rooted and easy to pull up. - Plants flower and set seed very late in the season (September-October); most other grasses seed much earlier in the year. Each plant can have one to three seed spikes that resemble crabgrass. - Stems can develop a reddish tint late in the season. If you think you have stiltgrass on your property, please review the above list of characters to confirm, and check your plants against photos of stiltgrass at these websites: [MNAP](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/features/invasive_plants/microstegium.html), [GoBotany](https://gobotany.nativeplanttrust.org/species/microstegium/vimineum/). If you still believe you have found stiltgrass, please either map the location with images in the online mapping tool [iMapInvasives](https://www.imapinvasives.org/), or send an email with photos and location description to [invasives.mnap@maine.gov](mailto:invasives.mnap@maine.gov). New detections of stiltgrass should be controlled to keep this damaging grass from invading Maine's forests and natural areas. DACF staff can offer guidance to affected landowners.

The spider checklist marks the culmination of a 14-year collaboration between deceased researcher and Maine spider expert Dr. Daniel T. Jennings and the MFS, as well as retired Forest Entomologist Charlene Donahue, and Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MIFW). Jennings passed away [September 14, 2020](https://obituaries.bangordailynews.com/obituary/daniel-jennings-1080196862), as the final details of the publication were being worked out. \"Most people don't count spiders among their favorite creatures,\" commented Allison Kanoti, State Entomologist. \"But spiders are an important part of our world, and we depend upon their existence.\" The Checklist of Maine Spiders (ARACHNIDA: ARANEAE) is [available online](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/documents/CHECKLIST%20OF%20MAINE%20SPIDERS%20Sept%202020.pdf) for anyone interested in cataloging their encounters with these fascinating residents of Maine, and the detailed information on the 71,000 specimens Jennings identified is available from the MFS. About the Checklist of Maine Spiders Project In the fall of 2006, representatives of the MFS and MIFW met with Dr. Jennings to devise a plan that would allow him to continue his work on identifying Maine spiders. The goal was to understand better what lives in Maine and publish a checklist of Maine spiders so that others could then use this baseline information. At the time of the meeting, Jennings had identified 586 species from Maine. With the support of DACF and MIFW, Jennings' existing database was expanded, and he identified another 91 species, bringing the total to 677 different kinds of spiders found in Maine. Seventy-one thousand individual spiders were collected, cataloged, and identified by Jennings. Most were collected by Jennings or through his work with Franklin Graham on the Spiders of Milbridge (Washington County) and Nancy Sferra on the spiders of the Waterboro (York County) pine barrens. Many others came from the University of Maine research projects (particularly on spruce budworm and blueberry production, and many graduate student projects) and MFS bark beetle and wood borer traps. Still others were gathered on a spider BioBlitz held in Acadia National Park in 2007 and through material submitted by curious collectors. Spiders were examined from all sixteen Maine counties and a diversity of habitats, including forests, blueberry fields, potato fields, bogs, fens, gravel pits, backyards, mountaintops, coastal beaches, and rocky shores. More came from Washington, Penobscot, and York Counties than other areas. There is more work to be done on understanding Maine's spider fauna. Not only is the data collected through Jennings' work rich in details not captured in the checklist, but there are also undoubtedly undiscovered species to be documented. These could include spiders that extend their ranges northward with a warming climate and those which remain uncatalogued due to under-sampling of some Maine areas and the varied natural features of the state.

Spanning a host of products, from strawberries to mixed vegetables, SCBG grants totaling $534,303.00 are being awarded to: Blue Barn LLC, Daybreak Growers Alliance, the Maine Maple Producers Association, the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Alliance, and multiple projects with the University of Maine system (in the School of Biology and Ecology, the School of Food and Agriculture, and the Maine Food and Agriculture Center). DACFs Division of Quality Assurance and Regulation will also apply $12,000 of SCBG funding to a pilot project supporting farmers seeking certification in Good Agricultural Practices. Find more information about current and past SCBG projects on the [DACF webpage](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/grants/usda_specialty_crop.shtml). In 2020 the DACF received twice as many proposals as in recent years. \"The pool of proposals was outstanding, which reflects the dynamism and diversity among Maines specialty crop producers,\" according to Bureau Director Nancy McBrady. Making this federal funding available to producers, researchers, and innovators of Maines specialty crops is an important way we can strengthen Maines agricultural sector. Funding emerging specialty crop products diversify the agricultural landscape and help make crop production more sustainable. Eric Martin, co-proprietor of Blue Barn LLC, which makes Bluet wine, says, We think today's Maine wild blueberry barrens could be tomorrow's wine country, and SCBG support is an amazing step towards trying to make that happen.\" According to Dr. David Handley, Small Fruit, and Vegetable Specialist at the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, the grant program also helps advance research that would otherwise put farmers at high financial risk to undertake themselves. Funds from the SCBG program allow UMCE to test for new small fruit varieties that are both well suited to Maines climate and offer improvements in quality, winter hardiness, and pest tolerance. The federal SCBG program is intended to increase the competitiveness of non-commodity crops. The USDA [defines specialty crops](//www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/scbgp/specialty-crop) as fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops (including floriculture). Through the block grant model, the federal government awards funding to individual state agricultural agencies to make local decisions about how to allocate the funds. Typically, the DACF releases an SCBG Request for Proposals each year in February, with applications due in March or April. Since 2002, the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program has awarded over 6.5 million dollars to the Maine DACF to support the growing number of specialty crop producers selling into local and regional markets. # Officials Request the Public's Help Locating Ash Trees Sold at Maine Lowe's Locations October 26, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) seeks the public's help in locating ash trees sold at Lowe's stores in Maine during spring and summer 2020. DACF Horticulture and Forest Health officials are concerned that the trees may contain emerald ash borer (EAB), an invasive insect that kills ash trees. The trees originated at a nursery located in an EAB infested and [quarantined area](//www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/plant_pest_info/emerald_ash_b/downloads/eab_quarantine_map.pdf). Customers purchased thirty-six of these trees during spring and summer from Lowe's stores in Auburn, Augusta, Bangor, Brewer, Brunswick, Portland, Sanford, Scarborough, Thomaston, and Windham. The trees were potted, sold for $29.98, and labeled as Ash Green, Fraxinus pennsylvanica. (A tree tag sample follows this news release.) Customers who have not already been contacted by Lowe's are asked to get in touch with Maine State Horticulture Program, by emailing [bugwatch@maine.gov](mailto:bugwatch@maine.gov) or calling directly at 207-287-7545. DACF suggests that everyone refrain from planting any ash tree (Fraxinus spp., not mountain-ash) and the white fringe tree (Chionanthus sp.). EAB is established in Maine, and EAB infestations surround the state in Vermont, New Hampshire, New Brunswick, and Quebec. Ornamental ash trees in areas with EAB infestation require regular application of insecticides to survive and thrive. Visit [https://www.maine.gov/eab](https://www.maine.gov/eab</a>) for more information about emerald ash borer. DACF extends its gratitude to Lowe's and Clinton Nurseries for their response to this ash tree incident. DACF and Lowes staff worked collaboratively to address the situation, inform customers who purchased ash trees, and hang informational signage at Lowe's stores throughout Maine. About EAB in Maine EAB, first detected in Michigan in 2002, has spread across 35 states through wood products, including firewood and trees sold for planting. In Maine, EAB currently infests a small percentage of our ash trees. Current EAB [quarantine](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/index.shtml) areas in Maine include all of York and Cumberland Counties, parts of Oxford County, and the northeastern corner of Aroostook County. The quarantine boundaries were drawn to form a buffer on those towns where EAB had been detected. EAB was found in northern Aroostook County in May 2018, western York County in September 2018, and Cumberland County in September 2019. DACF remains committed to delaying this pest's impacts in uninfested areas through education, survey, quarantine, and biological control efforts. Supporting documents Governor Mills Urges USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue to Include Maine Farmers and Food Distributors in Critical Federal Aid Program November 5, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov AUGUSTA - Governor Mills is [urging](//www.maine.gov/dacf/about/news/docs/201104-gov-mills-to-sec-perdue.pdf) Secretary Sonny Perdue to reevaluate the latest round of Farmers to Families Food Box program contract awards to include Maine-based food distributors. \"Maine farmers, distributors, and local partners are ready and able to feed our families impacted by food insecurity,\" wrote Governor Mills. As it stands now, with a contractor from Maryland selected by the USDA to begin handling distribution for our state, Maine people will receive imported food from elsewhere, and we will have no control over the quality of food included in the boxes. As part of the Farmers to Families Food Box Program, the USDA is partnering with food distributors to purchase fresh produce, dairy, and meat products for food boxes for Americans in need. Maine Farmers Exchange, a Presque Isle distribution company, and Native Maine Produce & Specialty Foods, a Westbrook distribution company, received contracts as part of the Farmers to Food Box second round of awards during July. Still, no Maine-based food distributor was included in other program funding rounds, including the fourth round of [contracts](//www.ams.usda.gov/selling-food-to-usda/farmers-to-families-food-box/approved-contractors-round-four) announced Friday, October 30. We are once again urging you to quickly reevaluate the contractor selection process and include a Maine distributor (or distributors) in the Program's fourth round and all subsequent contract awards, Governor Mills wrote. This step will allow Mainers to execute the Farmers to Families Food Box Program responsibly and put our experience and good common sense to work for the USDA and the people of Maine. Governor Mills, Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal, and Senators Collins and King and Representatives Pingree and Golden have repeatedly encouraged Secretary Perdue to include Maine food distributors and farmers in the USDA's Farmers to Families Food Box Program and advocated for funding for agricultural producers negatively impacted by market disruptions due to COVID-19. # Save the Date! The 80th Agricultural Trades Show January 19-23, 2021 November 13, 2020 Thank you to everyone who responded to the Department's recent survey about the virtual Ag Trades Show (ATS). We heard from farmers, foresters, exhibitors, presenters and the general public. We want to share initial information about how the show is shaping up. This year's planning is an evolving process, so stay tuned as more ATS details are finalized. Please save the dates of January 19-23, 2021 (Tuesday through Saturday)! The five-day online ATS will be a mixture of live and pre-recorded presentations and forums on agricultural and forestry issues of interest, sessions for ag producer groups, exhibitor showcases, and networking opportunities. The schedule will be a mix of day, evening and weekend offerings. Our online platform will support a digital library of information, allowing people to access the ATS' content if they can't join live. The online nature of the ATS necessarily means that there will be a limited number of overall conference sessions. Typically, there are more than 100 unique sessions during the three-day in-person show. This year, due to the coronavirus pandemic and resulting virtual format, there will be just a fraction of that number as part of the Department's programming. However, Cooperative Extension, industry groups, and nonprofits are also planning winter training opportunities, some of which will dovetail with the ATS. We look forward to promoting those virtual programs as well. The Department will coordinate conference themes and presentations, directly responding to continuing feedback from the agricultural and forestry sectors. Department staff will be in touch with interested producer groups to organize sessions. In addition, pesticide credits and other annual credentials will be available online. Vendors and sponsors can also showcase their businesses online. The Department is looking forward to using this new format to share important information, interact with the broad ag and forestry communities, and to celebrate Maine agriculture in January 2021. While the Department continues its work coordinating the show, please bookmark the website: [maine.gov/dacf/agtradesshow](//www.maine.gov/dacf/agtradesshow). In the coming weeks, we will post a schedule and tips on attending the online show and exhibitor information. We invite attendees and participants to [subscribe](//public.govdelivery.com/accounts/MEDACF/subscriber/new) to our digital newsletters-we will share virtual ATS event information to help keep you in the know. Questions on how to participate? Email [acfagtradesshow@maine.gov](mailto:acfagtradesshow@maine.gov). About the Maine Agricultural Trades Show A tradition since 1941, DACF's Maine Agricultural Trades Show is where the state's agricultural community convenes to celebrate farming, network, and plan for the coming season. Organized and hosted by the Department, the show provides access to resources that empower farmers and rural communities. Typically, over 100 exhibitors and dozens of conference sessions are part of this show, attracting agricultural producers, educators, exhibitors, businesses, and others to celebrate farming, exchange best practices, and explore farming products, equipment, and services. The show is free and open to the public and is an excellent opportunity for all ages to experience Maine's dynamic agriculture industry. The 2021 show will be held virtually. DACF anticipates returning to an in-person format in 2022. Share Maine Holiday Cheer, Not Pests. November 16, 2020 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov Save time and money by sending healthy plant material and knowing shipping and labeling requirements. AUGUSTA - Invasive pests can hitchhike in or on wreaths and holiday plants destined for friends and families. Or they can hide in or on firewood brought from another state or Maine location to light a holiday fire. The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) Horticulture Program asks everyone to safeguard the nation's trees and plants by shipping healthy plant material. Help Protect the Holidays from Invasive Pests: - Check state-by-state plant material regulations on the DACF website. - Carefully inspect plant material before packaging to ensure they are free of insects such as scales, egg masses, or other pest damage. - Label packages containing holiday plant material clearly, beginning with the statement, \"Grown in Maine,\" followed by the county of origin and the shipper's name and address. - Labels should indicate the contents of the package(s), including the different types of greenery, nuts, fruits, and cones used to decorate wreaths. - Changes were made in 2019 to the federal gypsy moth program. All Maine wreath and tree shippers must comply with gypsy moth regulations when sending plant material outside the gypsy moth quarantine area. A map of the gypsy moth quarantine area can be found here. Contact the Maine USDA-PPQ office at 207-848-0000 for more information. - Firewood should be sourced as close to where it will be burned as possible. Purchase heat-treated firewood if it must be transported longer distances. \"Shippers are required to honor state laws and regulations regarding the movement of plants and forest products,\" advised Carole Neil, DACF Assistant Horticulturist. \"States closely monitor shipments to prevent the introduction of invasive insects and plant diseases. By planning, Maine shippers can speed up deliveries in this time-sensitive industry.\" \"Import requirements for cut trees and holiday decorations including greenery, ornamental nuts, and fruit exist to protect regional agriculture and natural resources from the risk of plant pests,\" explained Sarah Scally, DACF Assistant Horticulturist. \"An insect or plant disease that occurs in Maine could potentially be invasive in other states. Despite Maine products' quality, some shippers have learned about these regulations the hard way and have had shipments delayed, impounded, or destroyed. We want to prevent any losses by getting the word out now.\" Shippers with questions are invited to call: (207) 287-3891 or email [horticulture@maine.gov](mailto:horticulture@maine.gov).

The correct number is seven; South Berwick was excluded from the count. AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's (DACF) Maine Forest Service (MFS) reports evidence of spread of emerald ash borer (EAB) within regulated areas of Maine. This fall, EAB infestations were confirmed in the towns of Van Buren in Aroostook County, Gorham in Cumberland County, and Ogunquit, Parsonsfield, Shapleigh and South Berwick in York County. Targeted surveys by MFS staff to locate potential future biological control release sites uncovered the first detected infestation in the York County town of Newfield. EAB was first detected in Maine in 2018 in both Aroostook County and York County. It was also found in 2019 through trapping in Cumberland County. These detections have led to [quarantine regulations](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/index.shtml) in all of York and Cumberland Counties and parts of Oxford and Aroostook Counties. Although EAB has not been detected in any new counties in 2020, Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) monitoring programs show EAB populations are expanding within already-regulated Maine areas. Each spring, MFS staff and volunteers from many sectors help detect EAB by participating in the girdled trap tree network, an EAB monitoring program. [Girdled ash trees](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab_trap_trees.htm) are attractive to any EAB in the immediate area. The trees are felled in the fall, and sections of them peeled to look for EAB activity. These trap trees provide a good low-tech detection tool that can be used wherever ash trees grow. \"The girdled trap tree network is critical to our response to emerald ash borer in Maine,\" explained DACF forest entomologist Colleen Teerling. Most of the six biological control release sites established in York County in 2020 were identified through this program, and every year since 2018, this method has provided us with first detections in towns. In 2020, at least 34 trees were girdled across 8 of Maine's 16 counties, and nearly all have been processed. Over the past ten years, this processing has been a social event, where interested landowners, forest managers, and others could participate in the sampling. This year, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, processing was conducted by MFS, City of Portland, and Acadia National Park staff. Of the 33 trees processed, nine showed signs of EAB, including exit holes, larval galleries (the tracks etched into the bark and sapwood of the tree as the larvae feed) and EAB larvae. The nine positive trees were within the area currently regulated by the EAB quarantine. First detections for a town occurred in Gorham (one tree), South Berwick (one tree) and Van Buren (one tree). Additionally, the first evidence of within-tree damage was found in Grand Isle (three trees, positive traps in 2018), Frenchville (one tree, positive trap in 2018), and Portland (two trees, positive trap in 2019). A positive tree was also found in South Berwick. | | Town | | County | | Number Trees Girdled | | Number With EAB | | Number Without EAB | | Surveyor (s) | | Fort Kent | | Aroostook | | 3 | | 0 | | 3 | | MFS, UMFK | | Frenchville | | Aroostook | | 3 | | 1* | | 2 | | MFS | | Grand Isle | | Aroostook | | 5 | | 3* | | 2 | | MFS | | Houlton | | Aroostook | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | MFS | | Limestone | | Aroostook | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | MFS | | Van Buren | | Aroostook | | 2 | | 1** | | 1 | | Landowner, MFS | | Wade | | Aroostook | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | MFS | | Freeport | | Cumberland | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | MFS | | Gorham | | Cumberland | | 1 | | 1** | | 0 | | Landowner | | Naples | | Cumberland | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | BPL | | Portland | | Cumberland | | 3 | | 2* | | 1 | | City | | South Portland | | Cumberland | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | MFS | | Bar Harbor | | Hancock | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | ANP | | Mount Desert | | Hancock | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | ANP | | Benton | | Kennebec | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | Landowner | | Denmark | | Oxford | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | Landowner | | Fryeburg | | Oxford | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | Landowner | | Dixmont | | Penobscot | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | Landowner | | Patten | | Penobscot | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | MFS | | Cornish | | York | | 1 | | 0 | | 1 | | Landowner | | South Berwick | | York | | 2 | | 1** | | 1 | | Landowner, BPL | | TOTALS: | | 33 | | 9 | | 24 - First detection of EAB damage in ash trees in this town, previous detections on traps. ** First detection of EAB in this town. ANP: Acadia National Park, BPL: Bureau of Parks and Lands, EAB: Emerald Ash Borer, MFS: Maine Forest Service, UMFK: University of Maine Fort Kent Highlighting all Mainers' importance in detecting forest health issues, observations from landowners and foresters have turned up EAB infestations in three York County towns: Ogunquit, Parsonsfield, and Shapleigh. The Maine Forest Service is extremely grateful for the continued support of the public in responding to EAB, Teerling said. In particular, we thank the volunteers in the girdled trap tree network who contribute their time and their trees and people who observe damaged trees or suspicious insects and then make an effort to report them. Data from monitoring help inform quarantine regulations, guide management decisions about ash trees in forest, urban, and landscape settings, and determine the best locations for release of EAB's natural enemies (biological control). The spread of EAB in southern Maine, which is on the leading edge of the insects distribution, is more significant than that in the smaller infestation center in northern Maine. In both cases, the natural spread is inevitable and may be slowed using biological controls to reduce population and careful ash management. A more significant impact on the spread can be had through targeting human-caused movement: by observing [best management practices](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/documents/Ash_regulated_area-BMP.pdf) for handling ash within regulated areas, following quarantine rules, using local or heat-treated [firewood](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/firewood.shtml), and avoiding using ash in new tree plantings.

While outdoor activities are great ways to stay healthy during Maine's winter, it is important for everyone venturing to Maines public parks and land trust preserves to continue following COVID-19 health guidance. In addition, all should be prepared for short days, cold temperatures, snow and ice, and ever-changing, unpredictable conditions. \"Our goal is to help create safe experiences for everyone,\" explained Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal. This partnerships goal is to inform and remind residents and visitors that we can and should enjoy the tranquility and peace of our outdoors this winter while preventing the spread of COVID-19. Maines conservation and recreation communities, natural resource agencies, and outdoor brand leaders developed checklists to help us all enjoy Maines outdoors in ways that are safe and responsible this winter, added Doreen MacGillis, Chair of the Maine Land Trust Network. Before you head outside: Be Prepared - Dress for success: Be aware of current conditions and bring appropriate gear to match those conditions, including, snowshoes, ice grips, and plenty of layers to stay warm. Local outdoor stores are available to give advice on appropriate clothing and equipment. Consider buying a Maine-made brand! - Check before you go: While many conservation lands remain open during the winter, access roads and parking areas may not be accessible. At the same time, conditions may not be safe or appropriate for desired activities such as ice fishing. Visit websites to see the latest information on closures and to learn about current conditions. - Know whats available: Consider visiting a nearby great resource.) - Dont take risks: Stick to familiar terrain to avoid injuries, which add stress on first responders and medical resources. If you're headed out alone, let someone know where you're going and be especially careful. Heed All COVID-19 Health Warnings - Practice physical distancing: Stay at least six feet away from other people who do not live in your household. Step aside when passing other people on the trail and be considerate it's different than how you've experienced the outdoors in the past, but necessary as we try to stay safe. - Wear a mask: When you're in the vicinity of others, even with six feet of separation, a mask will help keep everyone safer. - Have a plan B: If the parking lot is full, the destination is too crowded. If your first destination has a busy parking lot, go to the next spot on your list. Do not park on public or private roads where snowbanks prohibit parking completely off of the road. - If you're sick, stay home: It puts others at risk when you leave home while exhibiting symptoms related to COVID-19, or if you have recently been exposed to the virus. - If you or friends or family are traveling from out of state, please adhere to Maines travel and [quarantine guidelines](//www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/infectious-disease/epi/airborne/coronavirus/travel.shtml). \"Getting outdoors is extremely beneficial to both your physical and mental health,\" concluded Maine Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Commissioner Judy Camuso. Enjoy Maine's natural resources this winter in safe and responsible ways and we can work through this unique time together. # [Appalachian Mountain Club](//amcmaine.org/) [Forest Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry](//www.maine.gov/dacf/) [Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife](//www.maine.gov/ifw/) [Maine Land [Maine Maine](//www.nature.org/en-us/about-us/where-we-work/united-states/maine/) Supporting documents Mills Administration Dedicates $10 Million to New Program to Assist Maine Food and Agriculture Businesses with COVID-19 Infrastructure Expenses December 4, 2020 AUGUSTA - Governor Janet Mills and Commissioner of Economic and Community Development Heather Johnson announced today that the Administration is committing $10 million in federal CARES Act Coronavirus Relief Funding (CRF) to a newly-created Agriculture and Food Processing Infrastructure Reimbursement Program.

This decision follows the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) announcement of plans to deregulate EAB effective January 14, 2021. EAB poses a significant threat to Maine's approximately 480 million ash trees. DACF officials maintain they are slowing EAB's impact through quarantines that limit the movement of ash out of infested areas. Although the spread of EAB across the state is inevitable, slowing EAB's spread will continue to allow for adaptation while maintaining viable wood product markets and ecosystem values. A slower spread of EAB will also allow for public utilities, the Maine Department of Transportation (MDOT), and cities and towns to better control ash tree management costs, necessary to protect infrastructure and public safety. As USDA APHIS deregulation takes effect, the Emergency Order will maintain prohibitions on importing ash into Maine. Simultaneously, a revision of existing Maine state EAB quarantine rules will be determined through a public review process. Through this revision process, DACF will propose regulating ash's movement into Maine from other infested states and provinces and maintaining the in-state movement restrictions while removing chipped ash material from the list of regulated articles. (Stakeholders interested in receiving information about revised EAB rules, including public hearings, comment deadlines, and the outcome, are encouraged to use the DACF news service and sign up for [EAB bulletins](//public.govdelivery.com/accounts/MEDACF/subscriber/new).) \"We remain committed to slowing the spread of EAB through quarantine, education, biological control, and advocacy for careful ash management,\" stated DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"For each of these efforts, the most important aspect is every individual doing their part to safeguard our natural and cultural resources.\" \"When and if we no longer can get ash, it could mean the end of our business,\" explained Rodney Buswell, Sr., owner of Peavey Manufacturing. \"I am sorry that the federal government has decided not to continue with help, but hope that at the state level, they'll keep working to contain this as long as possible.\" \"This is not the time to throw in the towel on the EAB quarantine in Maine. Maine Woodland Owner members and landowners like them are among the people who will be most impacted by the faster spread of emerald ash borer if a quarantine on the pest is not continued,\" said Executive Director of Maine Woodland Owners Tom Doak. \"I recognize a quarantine does not prevent the spread of this pest, but it does slow it down. With the time bought, ash already on woodlots will increase in value, and landowners will have more options for management before the insect arrives.\" \"I believe the federal deregulation taking place next month is premature given the large areas within Maine with no current detections of EAB,\" said Dr. John Daigle, University of Maine Professor of Forest Recreation Management. \"Time is of the essence to test and implement different strategies to reduce the rate of spread of EAB as well as to determine best practices in protecting ash trees in Maine and sustaining ash in our landscape for cultural and ecological reasons.\" Since 2009, the University of Maine has worked to bring Wabanaki basket makers, researchers, Maine DACF, and federal agencies together in an EAB-Ash Task Force. The EAB-Ash Task Force has been vital for implementing studies and sharing findings from the latest research to help prepare and respond to EAB's imminent threats and sustain Wabanaki basket makers' cultural practices with ash trees. \"Our research partnerships and engagements with Native basket-makers and harvesters here in Maine and across the northeast show that the EAB is as much a threat to the cultures and well-being of Native communities and economies as it is a threat to trees,\" explained Dr. Darren Ranco, Chair of Native American Programs at the University of Maine, and Founding Member of the EAB Ash Task Force. \"Deregulation would severely limit the opportunities and methods we collectively have to minimize these harms on Native economic and cultural issues.\" \"Around six percent of the trees in Bath's Tree Inventory are ash, with even more on private properties and in forested areas. A city-wide infestation of EAB will significantly impact our green infrastructure,\" explained Kyle Rosenberg, Bath City Arborist. \"In one year, a 10-inch diameter ash tree deflects over 1000 gallons of stormwater run-off, helps conserve 65 kilowatts of energy due to reduced use of heating and cooling systems, sequesters over 250 pounds of carbon from the atmosphere and adds to the overall appeal and sense of place Bath residents and visitors have come to enjoy.\" \"Roadways often are corridors for the movement of invasive plants and animals. The State of Maine will require federal support and funding to continue this battle at the state level. Dead ash along highways may present undue risk. Removals and mapping of existing ash may increase our costs,\" stated Robert Moosmann, MaineDOT Statewide Vegetation Manager. \"I encourage the USDA to continue to help. We will need their assistance and expertise as we continue our response to EAB.\" Since 2002, when EAB was first discovered in the United States in Michigan, USDA APHIS has sought to limit the insect's spread using quarantines, permits, and compliance agreements that regulated the movement of wood, which may contain the insect. DACF will propose rules to continue this approach to slow the spread while also working to mitigate impacts in the state's already infested areas. An announcement regarding the public hearings and comment period will take place early in 2021. Everyone Can Help Slow EAB - Learn to recognize emerald ash borer attacks. - If you suspect you have seen emerald ash borer or evidence of its attack on trees in Maine, please report it. - Follow best management practices and quarantine rules when handling ash. - Spread the word, not the bugs: Use local or heat-treated firewood!

As expected, 2020 activity broke all records for recreation visits, which includes day-use and camping. For the first time, total State Park attendance topped three million visitor-days. Despite pandemic-related spring closures and season-long capacity limitations, a total of 3,067,112 people visited Maine State Parks. In 2020, the BPL welcomed 2,786,750 day-use visitors, up 74,532 280,362 camping visitors, up 21,871 (8%) from 2019. 2018 edged out 2019 as the second-highest year for recreation visits, followed by 2016 and 2017. \"Everyone wants and needs to get outside, and Maine State Parks are some the best destinations to relax and reinvigorate,\" said Andy Cutko, Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands Director. \"In particular, with various travel limitations in place, it was great to see so many Maine families discovering our State Parks for the first time. The whole BPL team and I extend a huge and warm thank you to everybody who arrived at the parks prepared with face coverings and hand sanitizer and all the other requisite supplies for getting outside safely during the pandemic.\" \"Our biggest concern going into 2020s peak-season in our State Parks was the risk of COVID-19 exposure for our staff and our visitors,\" said Amanda Beal, DACF Commissioner. \"Fortunately, because of our team's preparedness and professionalism, we made strategic designs, and we stayed healthy while creating safe experiences for the more than three million people who came to visit. It is quite an achievement, and one we intend to repeat in 2021.\" Camper Alert: The Maine State Park camping reservation call center opens Monday, February 1, 2021.

DACF's [Technical Guidance For Utility-Scale Solar Installation and Development on Agricultural, Forested, and Natural Lands](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/resources/docs/solar-guidance-182020.pdf) provides practical information for landowners to utilize when considering solar development. The document also provides technical guidance for solar developers when designing, installing, and removing solar projects. \"The Department fully supports the State's goals for reducing reliance on fossil fuels and pursuing renewable energy generation. We also encourage thoughtful siting of solar projects and believe that the guidance we are issuing today will be a beneficial resource to landowners and developers alike in that regard,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. To complement the new guidance, DACF created a Solar Siting Resources [webpage](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/resources/solar.shtml) that contains a robust set of resources for anyone interested in learning more about the intersection of solar power and agriculture or forestry. The department also created an Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Financial Resources for Farms [webpage](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/resources/energy-efficiency.shtml) that highlights opportunities that may help keep farms productive, reduce costs, and lessen environmental impacts. \"Agricultural production, solar development, and energy efficiency investments can be mutually beneficial when thoughtfully planned. We are ready to assist farmers and forestland owners with these resources,\" said Bureau of Agriculture Director Nancy McBrady. \"Proper planning and good decision-making is critical, with some solar projects, we are talking about removing land that has generated timber jobs and income for generations,\" said Patty Cormier, Maine State Forester. \"With these new solar siting tools, we hope to help landowners and developers make the best and most informed decisions.\" DACF is hosting a free Maine Solar Development and Agriculture Opportunities and Impacts Session during the 2021 Maine Agricultural Trades Show, Friday, January 22, 2021, from 12:15 to 1:15 pm. This online session will explore the resources available for siting solar on agricultural land.

Commissioner Amanda Beal Urges USDA Secretary Sonny Perdue to Include Maine's Food Distributors in the Farmers to Families Food Box Program January 14, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [jim.britt@maine.gov](mailto:jim.britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA, Maine - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) is again asking U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Perdue to improve the Farmers to Families Food Box Program program. Specifically, DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal is calling on the Secretary to ensure that food boxes are distributed equitably, create fair opportunities for local vendors and producers to participate; and broaden the program's scoring criteria. \"We are again requesting that Maine-based food distributors be included in Round Five of the Farmers to Families Food Box Program contract awards,\" said Commissioner Beal. \"Maines distributors are best equipped to coordinate with local partners and meet the needs of families relying on this food box program.\" The full text of the letter can be found [here](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/about/news/docs/fffb-letter-to-usda-1132021.pdf). Mills Administration Announces $18 Million in CARES Act Relief Grants Awarded to 609 Farms, Food Processors and Producers, Food Banks and Pantries January 19, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: jim.britt@maine.gov Note: The total number of grant recipients is 609. The funds were awarded through three CARES Act Relief Grant Programs: the CARES Act Agriculture and Food Processing Infrastructure Reimbursement Program, the CARES Act E-Commerce Reimbursement Program, and the CARES Act Food Security Network Reimbursement Program. \"At the outset of the pandemic and as more people sought Maine-grown, -raised, and -made products, our farms, food processors, and food suppliers adapted to create safe environments for both employees and customers,\" said Governor Mills. \"I am grateful for the ways our agricultural community has responded during the pandemic to serve the people of Maine and my administration will continue to deploy every available resource to ensure their success in these challenging times.\" \"As markets were disrupted and food insecurity grew significantly over the past year, many businesses and nonprofits in the food sector pivoted their production and distribution models to continue operations and keep employees, volunteers, and customers safe,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"Our ability to offer reimbursements for some unanticipated expenses enhances their stability and allows them to stay focused on the important work that they do.\" \"We were honored to partner with DACF to stand up these CARES ACT grant programs,\" said Gray Harris, Senior Vice President, Food Systems, CEI. \"It was an opportunity to serve Maine's agriculture and food sector that we could not pass up. The impact is profound and will be long-lasting-$17.3 million is now circulating in the Maine farm and food economy, in the communities where Maine's farmers and food producers live and work. It's been extremely satisfying to be a part of this collaborative, rapid response team.\" \"Catholic Charities Maine was proud to be able to respond quickly and assist the State of Maine with the distribution of critical funds at a time when more people than ever before are experiencing hunger and food insecurity in our state,\" said Steve Letourneau, CEO, Catholic Charities Maine. We processed and ultimately awarded 89 grants to food pantries, food banks and other groups involved with the distribution of food to those in need. I have no doubt that this program had a positive impact on thousands of lives.\" CARES Act Agriculture and Food Processing Infrastructure Reimbursement Program Created in collaboration with the Maine Economic and Community Development Department (DECD) and administered by Coastal Enterprises, Inc. (CEI), the Agriculture and Food Processing Infrastructure Reimbursement Program awarded $17.3 million in grants to 437 farms, processors, and other food supply chain businesses for COVID-19 related infrastructure investments, spanning major processing upgrades to obtaining necessary PPE. The Program was initially announced as providing $10 million in CRF. However, given high application demand, additional funds were made available to fulfill all eligible applications. \"When we harvest, we need people to inspect our potatoes before they go into storage. We invested in equipment, primarily conveyors, to create the space needed for our employees to work safely and stay healthy,\" said Dan Blackstone, Owner, Blackstone Seed Growers LLC (Caribou) \"The reimbursement we received from the state was tremendously helpful in keeping our operations running smoothly, and helping our employees stay connected while still staying safe. We invested in an onsite Liquid Nitrogen tank as an alternative to liquid Co2. This has enabled us to have more assurance that we will not have disruptions to our production process due to Co2 shortages during the pandemic. In addition, we invested in headsets for our production team to enable effective distancing, while still allowing communication. We also purchased additional laptops/hardware to support remote working, as many of our employees have been working from home since March,\" said Craig Frey, Director of Finance, Allagash Brewing Company (Portland) \"This grant saved our business essentially; we lost 80% of our foodservice market as soon as the state of emergency took effect. We went back to the drawing board and invested in slicing and packing equipment to access the retail sales channel. We also invested in becoming a licensed co-packer for the small producers who needed to find ways to get their products to market,\" said Oliver Perkins, Owner, A Small Good (Rockport) \"The demand for local beef and pork meant we needed to invest in more freezer space, and we needed to upgrade our power supply. Our business is up 60% over 2019. We also increased the size of our retail store and purchased the PPE our staff needed to stay safe,\" said Barry Higgins, Owner, Maple Lane Farms (Charleston) \"We are still in the process of adjusting, but this grant has solved financial worries for us so that we can focus on our business,\" said Seth Kroeke, Owner, Crystal Spring Farm (Brunswick) CARES Act E-Commerce Reimbursement Program The E-commerce Reimbursement Program, also administered by CEI, awarded $247,000 to 84 farmers for unplanned e-commerce investments, including online sales management and payment processing platforms, order processing and fulfillment software, and website customization. \"When it was clear we needed to find a way to reach a bigger audience of customers, we invested in our website. We added new photos and implemented software to improve our ability to manage pre-orders. Our farmers' market transactions went contactless. We added ecards for our CSA customers. We hired people to help us find the right platforms, take photos, do the writing, and more. All of this was done to create more awareness, share our story, and help people buy our food safely,\" said Jan Goranson, Owner, Goranson Farm (Dresden) \"Curbside and pre-ordering are here to stay. Before the pandemic, we were contemplating ways to improve our website, but we knew we had to set up online ordering when it hit. We invested in creating databases necessary to display our products online and added a wish-list tool for our customers. This investment has gotten us a lot closer to a more sophisticated POS system with real-time inventory,\" said Wendy Reinemann, Owner, Guini Ridge Farm (Rockport) \"Before the pandemic, we planned to launch our value-added products at grocery store chains and independentbrick and mortar stores in the summer of 2020. Then, everything changed for everyone in March. After a lot of deliberation, we decided we needed to pivot again and focus our efforts online. We moved our website to a platform that was better for goods. We hired a website designer who helped streamline our website to create an easy and efficient shopping experience, and we added apps to the site to increase sales, such as subscription options and email drip campaigns,\" said Holly Arbuckle, Owner, Singing Pastures (Newcastle) CARES Act Food Security Network Reimbursement Program The Food Security Network Reimbursement Program, administered by Catholic Charities of Maine, provided $621,000 in grants to 88 food banks and pantries for unanticipated expenses associated with overcoming food supply and distribution challenges caused by COVID-19. \"Our reimbursement is for the purchases we made of culturally appropriate foods to support new Mainers. Items like fufupowder, cassava leaves and dried fish and other food items not readily available through TEFAP,\" said Mary Zwolinski, Executive Director, Wayside Food Programs (Portland) \"The Food Security Network Reimbursement Program is a great fit for us for several reasons, but mostly because it allowed us to what we do. Our reimbursement is for the PPE investment required in December to continue our staff's food preparation and distribution to clients across Aroostook County,\" said Sherry Locke, Development and Communications Manager, Aroostook County Action Program (Presque Isle) DACF's third-party administrative partners are currently focused on processing payments associated with the three programs. All CRF grant funds are expected to be distributed by the end of the first quarter of 2021.

Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Announces 2021 Commissioner's Distinguished Service Award January 21, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [jim.britt@maine.gov](mailto:jim.britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA - Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) Commissioner Amanda Beal announced at the virtual Agricultural Trades Show this week that the Commissioner's Distinguished Service Award recipient for 2021 is Penelope (Penny) Jordan, a fourth-generation farmer in Cape Elizabeth, and local community organizer. Over three decades, Jordan has emerged as a leading voice in Maine Agriculture. She was instrumental in starting the Cape Farm Alliance and is a past president and 12-year member of the Maine Farm Bureau. Penny has served on the Cumberland County Farm Bureau board, is currently on the Maine Sustainable Agriculture Society board, and is a member of the New England Farmers Union. Besides her agricultural organization involvement, she serves on the Cape Elizabeth Town Council, chairing the Ordinance Committee and representing Cape Elizabeth on the Maine Municipal Association's Policy Committee. Jordan's passions are agriculture and ending hunger in Maine, and she is active in hunger prevention programs in Southern Maine. She is currently working to form an organization called \"Farms for Food Equity,\" that will move Maine farm products into the charitable food system. Jordan also played a pivotal role last year in leading the development of a framework for DACF to design and implement a statewide strategic plan to address food insecurity as required by the passage of LD 1159 - the Resolve To End Hunger In Maine, passed during the 129th legislative session and signed into law by Governor Mills. \"Penny is well known for her numerous contributions to agriculture in the state through the roles she has held on various boards and for her passion for farming and feeding her community,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"If there was ever someone who deserved to be recognized for 'distinguished service' in Maine agriculture, it is Penny, and it was an honor to present her with this award.\" Penny holds a master's degree in social work, with a community organizing and program design focus, and she brings many skills from that training into her work. She was raised on the farm she currently operates, Jordan's Farm, alongside her brother, Bill Jr., and sisters, Pam and Carol Anne, and her nephew, Phil. [Jordan's Farm](//www.jordansfarm.com/), a 60+ acre mixed vegetable and market farm, grows a wide variety of products with a significant focus on strawberries, tomatoes, corn, pumpkins, green beans, lettuces, and salad greens. Jordan's products are available at retail, through wholesale, and at their seasonal farm stand. In 2014 Jordan's Farm teamed up with Farmers' Gate Market from Wales, Maine, to create a year-round store in South Portland, now called Solo Cucina Market, which features Maine meats, produce, and other products. # Supporting documents Applications Open for the 2021 Allagash Wilderness Waterway Visiting Artist Program February 1, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [jim.britt@maine.gov](mailto:jim.britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA, Maine - Applications are now open for the Allagash Wilderness Waterway (AWW) 2021 Visiting Artist Program, which brings artists to the remote wilderness of Maine for two-weeks of solitude. The program provides artists with the opportunity to immerse themselves in nature to interpret and share their experiences through their art.

Governor Mills Establishes Task Force to Develop Forest Carbon Program for Maine Woodland Owners February 3, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [jim.britt@maine.gov](mailto:jim.britt@maine.gov) Task force will consider forest carbon storage incentives for small-to-medium size woodland owners to help protect their property while fighting climate change AUGUSTA, Maine - As part of Maine's ambitious effort to fight climate change by reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions, Governor Janet Mills has signed an Executive Order to create the Maine Forest Carbon Task Force. The Task Force is a recommendation from the state's new four-year climate action plan, [Maine Won't Wait](//climatecouncil.maine.gov), and aims to develop a voluntary program for small-to-medium size woodland owners in Maine of who want to utilize their land for long-term storage of carbon emissions, a process known as carbon sequestration. Forest carbon programs provide financial incentives to preserve forests, thereby storing carbon emissions. However, today, most existing programs are not accessible or economically feasible for smaller woodland owners. Meanwhile, forests cover 89 percent of Maine and are the foundation for Maines forest products industry and the states overall natural resource-based economy. Each year, Maine's forests sequester an amount of carbon equal to at least 60 percent of the state's annual carbon emissions, a figure that rises to 75 percent when durable forest products are included. The Task Force work seeks to build upon this effort. \"This Task Force is a critical first step in Maine's effort to harness the immense ability of our natural lands as a powerful force for storing harmful carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality,\" said Governor Mills. \"Developing voluntary incentives for Maine's small woodland owners, foresters, and loggers to store carbon will not only help stem climate change, but also give Maine families a new resource to protect their lands for future generations.\" \"A right-sized forest carbon program would deliver financial benefits for small landowners by encouraging climate-centered forestry practices to increase Maine's carbon storage,\" said Amanda Beal, Commissioner of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF), and one of two appointed co-chairs of the task force. \"The work of this task force will help us to determine the parameters of such a program and to ensure it meets the needs of Maine's landowners and the overall goals of the Maine Climate Council.\" \"Maines forests support abundant environmental resources, wildlife biodiversity, recreational opportunities, and a critical $8.5 billion forest products industry,\" said task-force member Ivan Fernandez, Distinguished Maine Professor at the School of Forest Resources and Climate Change Institute at the University of Maine. \"With pressures like climate change, land development, and others posing risks to the future of our forests, I look forward to using the best available science and working with woodland owners, loggers, and foresters to further utilize our forests to mitigate climate change while ensuring the values we enjoy from them continue for generations to come.\" \"Maine family woodland owners play a critical role in the health of the environment and have a keen interest in carbon markets. But existing systems do not work well for small- and medium-sized woodland owners,\" said Tom Doak, Executive Director of Maine Woodland Owners. \"We welcome this opportunity to explore voluntary ways in which these woodland owners can participate and benefit from carbon markets and carbon-friendly practices while protecting the environment and supporting the ongoing public benefits of forested lands.\" By law, Maine must reduce its carbon emissions by 45 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, and by 80 percent by 2050. Governor Mills also signed an Executive Order directing Maine to achieve carbon neutrality by 2045, a process that depends on curbing harmful emissions while also bolstering natural climate solutions, like forest carbon sequestration. Unlocking the powerful carbon-storage potential of forested lands means designing a forest carbon program that helps reduce the loss of natural and working lands to development, which is now estimated at 10,000 acres annually and rising. To recommend a comprehensive plan and framework for woodland owners to manage their land for carbon storage, carbon sequestration, or both, the Task Force will: - Review available data for practice-based carbon programs throughout the United States; - Review current harvest levels and carbon stocking data on woodland owners of 10 to 10,000 acres; - Identify a suite of climate-friendly forest management practices that improve carbon stocks and maintain current timber harvest levels; - Identify a suite of financial incentives and technical assistance activities to increase carbon sequestration on woodland owners of 10 to 10,000 acres and carbon sinking in wood products through active forest management; - Identify incentives for high-quality, on-the-ground performance by loggers and promote the use of low-impact harvesting equipment; - Recommend updates to the Open Space Current Use Taxation program including in a manner that incentivizes climate-friendly land management practices; - Explore opportunities for partnerships with large, commercial forestland owners; - Consider opportunities for Maine to participate in multi-state forest carbon initiatives; - Recommend the numeric goal or targets for increased carbon sequestration in Maine over time. The Task Force, co-chaired by Commissioner Beal and Tom Abello, Legislative Director for Governor Mills, consists of the following thirteen members appointed by the Governor. Task Force recommendations are required to be submitted to the Governor on or before September 1, 2021. - Mark Berry, The Nature Conservancy - Barrie Brusila, Mid-Maine Forestry - Adam Daigneault, School of Forest Resources, University of Maine - Tom Doak, Maine Woodland Owners - Dana Doran, Professional Logging Contractors of Maine - Ivan Fernandez, Climate Change Institute and School of Forest Resources, University of Maine - Alec Giffen, New England Forestry Foundation - Stacy Knapp, Maine Department of Environmental Protection - Donald Mansius, Maine Forest Service, Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry - Ryan Robicheau, Maine Department of Inland, Fisheries and Wildlife - Melissa Shea, The Mountain Farm - Patrick Strauch, Maine Forest Products Council - Karen Tilberg, Forest Society of Maine A copy of Executive Order is available [online](//www.maine.gov/governor/mills/sites/maine.gov.governor.mills/files/inline-files/EO%2081%2024.pdf).

Owners now have until June 2, 2021, to renew overdue dog licenses. [Licenses are available online](//apps1.web.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/dog_license/index.pl) and pet owners are strongly encouraged to renew license(s) before June 2 to avoid late fees. Veterinarian-administered rabies vaccinations and immunizations are required to be kept current. A rabies certificate is required when applying for a license. Why was this Executive Order necessary? - Dogs traditionally must be vaccinated and registered within their municipalities by the end of the calendar year. - At the start of the pandemic, many licensing requirements were temporarily suspended, including dog licensing. - With municipalities now operating at near pre-pandemic hours and in the interest of animal health, the licensure requirement has been reinstated. - Pet owners with overdue licenses have until June 2, 2021, to renew dog licenses. - Learn more about dog licenses, including fees, animal welfare and other important topics by visiting [Maine's Dog Licensing Online Purchasing & Renewal webpage](//apps1.web.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/dog_license/index.pl).

MFS recovered a new web from Fort Fairfield earlier this week. BTM winter webs are colonies of BTM caterpillars in white silk tightly woven around a leaf or leaves in trees or shrubs. The Aroostook County discoveries serve as a literal \"heads up\" for Mainers. MFS asks Mainers to go Heads Up! for BTM- look up to the trees for winter webs. In areas not already documented as having high BTM populations, winter web sightings, or suspected winter webs, should be reported to MFS by [emailing](mailto:foresthealth@maine.gov) or using the [online reporting form](//appengine.egov.com/apps/me/dacf/mfs-tree-ailment). Heads Up! for BTM: - The best time to be Heads Up! for BTM (aka joining the MFS winter 2021 BTM survey) is on a sunny day, with the sun at your back. - Inspect the branches' tips on hardwood trees, especially oak, apple, and other fruit trees. - Look for [shining silk](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/insects/browntail_moth_id_winter_nests.htm)tying last year's leaves to the branches. Binoculars help. - Winter webs vary quite a bit. Sometimes they are the size of a large fist. Other times they are a single leaf without much silk. - BTM winter webs always have white strands of woven silk holding the leaf/leaves tight to branches. BTM FAQs Q: Why is it important to know where BTM is? A: BTM is an invasive insect that can significantly impact our quality of life. It can cause a long-lasting, painful and itchy rash in some individuals, and inhalation of the caterpillars' shed hairs can cause respiratory distress. Other people suffer few impacts from exposure. Knowing BTM's location gives us the power to decide whether and how to manage its presence. Q: How can I manage BTM? A: Management options include clipping and [destroying the webs](//vimeo.com/192349741) within reach (best done before Mid-April and always wear eye protection and cover hands and skin). Hire an arborist or contract with a licensed pesticide applicator to control populations that are out of reach. Q: Is finding BTM in Aroostook surprising? A: The recent detection of BTM in Smyrna and Fort Fairfield is not as surprising as it might seem. BTM webs and caterpillars were reported at least as far north as Houlton in the early 1900s. Q: Is BTM in all parts of Maine? A: In recent years, captured BTM appeared in traps in almost every corner of Maine. The state's northwest corner is the only exception. Q: How does BTM move throughout the state? A: People easily move BTM as mature caterpillars, pupae, and adults; other stages are readily carried on live trees and shrubs. Q: How did BTM end up in Maine? A: It arrived here in the late 1800s, from Europe, on live trees and shrubs. Q: Is BTM more of a coastal problem? A: That was nearly true in the last outbreak, which ended in the early 2000s. MFS has reported inland populations in places like Augusta since 2007 and significant BTM populations in Bangor, beginning in 2018. Q: Are there BTM tools and resources available to read online and download? A: Many helpful resources, including [questions and answers](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/browntail_moth_faqs.htm) and tools for home- and land-owners, are available [online](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/browntail_moth_faqs.htm). Q: What is MFS doing to combat BTM? A: First and foremost, MFS is working with communities and organizations to communicate the vital message of BTM precautions. BTM has been in Maine for over 100 years. Sadly, eradicating BTM is not possible. What is possible is being prepared to remove winter webs when one is spotted and knowing infested areas to be avoided during summer and fall.

AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's (DACF) Plant Health Program (PHP) and Maine Forest Service (MFS) announced today that Maine is taking the next step to continue regulating the movement of ash wood material. Moving ash infested with Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) can spread this invasive insect to new areas. This decision follows USDA's January 14, 2021 announcement of removing federal domestic EAB quarantine regulations. DACF continues to see opportunities to slow EAB's spread; an estimated 90% of Maine's ash trees are outside of Maine's currently regulated areas. Ash is an important cultural resource for the Wabanaki, an important street tree, and a valuable timber species, accounting for around four percent of Maine's hardwood forest inventory. Maine's [proposed EAB quarantine rules](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/index.shtml) would maintain the prohibition on moving potentially EAB-infested materials into Maine's non-regulated areas from other states or Canadian provinces. The proposed rules also include three options for expanding the areas regulated within Maine. Maines amended quarantine proposal, which remains functionally the same as before federal de-regulation, includes three options for expanding the regulated area in Aroostook County. Each option addresses a specific concern. The Department needs to receive comments on all three. Any of the options could be adopted. - Option one adds three towns to provide a buffer around the latest EAB find in Van Buren. ( [see maps](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/documents/proposed/EAB-Quarantine20210218-option1.pdf)) - Option two includes all the towns in option one plus three towns west of Fort Kent. These towns are proposed to help facilitate firewood movement for home heating from dealers in the regulated area to St. John Plt., St. Francis, and Allagash. ( [see maps](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/documents/proposed/EAB-Quarantine20210218-option2.pdf)) - Option three includes all the towns in options one and two and adds a large block of towns south of the existing regulated area. This area is proposed to allow firewood movement from major dealers inside the current quarantine area south to Easton and west to T11 R7 WELS. This option will deregulate the flow of firewood and ash materials into the larger towns of Presque Isle, Caribou, and Fort Fairfield and to mills within the area. ( [see maps](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/documents/proposed/EAB-Quarantine20210218-option3.pdf)) The new proposal would also ease the restrictions on the movement of hardwood and ash wood chips. In the proposed rule, the restrictions on the movement of composted or uncomposted chips of the genus Fraxinus are removed. After years of EAB regulation across the country, the risk of chipped ash material has not appeared to be as high as previously thought. Removing this restriction should not significantly increase the potential for EAB spread. A virtual public hearing is scheduled for March 16, 2021, from 10:00 to 11:00 AM. Anyone interested in making public comment may [join the meeting using MS-Teams](//teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ZTNkNzk1OWYtOGZhNi00ZDYwLWIxNzItNjU0NGQ4M2U1YmY5%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22413fa8ab-207d-4b62-9bcd-ea1a8f2f864e%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%222f86c8b3-7a18-4213-bbdf-540046334990%22%7d) or by telephone at (207) 209-4724 - confirmation code: 390 166 010#.

Despite a potential expansion of the regulated area, MFS and the PHP encourage land managers to [follow Best Management Practices](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/documents/Ash_regulated_area-BMP.pdf) to reduce the spread of EAB within the regulated areas. EAB threatens all ash tree species (excluding mountain-ash) and will have significant ecological and economic impacts on the state. There are no practical means to control EAB in forested areas, though pesticide treatments can protect individual trees. More information on EAB can be found on the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's [EAB website](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/index.shtml).

Maine Specialty Crop Grant Program Applications Now Open March 8, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation, and Forestry's (DACF) Bureau of Agriculture seeks Specialty Crop Block Grants (SCBG) program applications from Maine's specialty crop industry to present for funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). DACF anticipates awarding at least $500,000 in 2021. The SCBG program is specifically designed to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops. Specialty crops include fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, horticulture, and nursery crops, including floriculture. Funds are awarded to programs through a competitive review process. Grant awards are for a one-year term. Applications may be resubmitted for consideration for additional funding in subsequent years. Priority areas for the 2021 SCBG program include: enhanced food safety education, primarily concerning FDA rules regarding improved handling and processing of specialty crop; soil and biotic health to improve pest management and biodiversity; marketing Maine specialty crops to diversified and expanded markets, or that research potential market expansion efforts and strategies; or improving adaptation and increased resilience to climate-related crop disturbances in support of long-term farm business vitality and productivity. \"Our goal with this grant program is to help strengthen and grow Maine's specialty crop production while nurturing local farming and food businesses,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"During the pandemic, demand for Maine-grown and produced food products increased markedly. This competitive grant opportunity will help farmers and food producers continue to meet ongoing demand.\" \"The SCBG is also an excellent vehicle to advance important research about Maine crops, whether it be cropping systems or resiliency in the face of climate change,\" said Nancy McBrady, Director of the Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources. \"We are excited to see what this new round of applications brings forward for advances in research.\" Agricultural organizations, educational institutions, commodity groups, municipalities, producers, and state agencies may download the [2021 SCBG application online](//www.maine.gov/dafs/bbm/procurementservices/vendors/grants).

Maine State Parks and Public Reserved Lands Expect to Attract Crowds for Spring March 10, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA- The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Bureau of Parks and Lands (BPL) expects the popularity of its outdoor destinations to continue this spring and urges guests to anticipate crowded parking areas and trailhead bottlenecks. BPL broke its record for recreation visits during 2020. Despite the pandemic, BPL's State Park system welcomed a total of [3,067,112 people](//www.maine.gov/dacf/about/news/news.shtml?id=3933399). During spring 2020, overcrowding and a lack of respect for COVID-19 guidance at BPL's ten coastal beach State Parks caused temporary closures. The goal for spring 2021 is not to repeat the closure experience with planning and cooperation, this goal should be achievable. \"A typical spring weekday includes plenty of parking and easy-to-navigate trailheads and trails,\" said BPL Director Andy Cutko. \"We're thrilled that people are getting outside. At the same time, weekends during March, April, and May, especially when temperatures start creeping up, bring elevated attendance numbers and the need for everyone to be thoughtful about outdoor activities.\" During 2020, BPL implemented routine and on-demand [communications](//www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/) to help guests plan their visits. In the face of potential spring crowding, BPL aims to continue sharing helpful planning information. Everyone venturing outdoors to Maine State Parks and Public Reserved Lands is reminded to keep these factors in mind: - COVID-19 precautions, including physical distancing and face coverings, remain in effect; [read the latest guidance](//www.maine.gov/decd/covid-19-prevention-checklists). Remember to pack hand sanitizer. - State Park staffing is limited during the spring season, so be patient in parking areas and please comply with signage and respect staff requests. - Tell someone where you're going and when you plan to return. - Have a backup plan - if your destination is crowded, utilize [Maine Trail Finder](//www.mainetrailfinder.com/)or consider visiting a nearby local [land trust](//www.mltn.org/). - Park safely and legally and avoid muddy areas. - Be prepared for outdoor vault toilets only, with no running water (use the bathroom before leaving home). Pack toilet paper and practice [Leave No Trace](//lnt.org/why/7-principles/dispose-of-waste-properly/), including cleaning up after your pet, so be sure to bring a disposable bag to carry out any waste. - With colder temps forecasted, trails may be icy - prepare with proper footwear and gear. - Get outside earlier or later in the day to avoid peak times, and please keep your visits brief. - Stick to easy trails to avoid injuries and further stress on health care resources. - And remember to take precautions to prevent exposure to ticks by wearing light-colored pants, closed-toe shoes, and applying EPA-approved [bug repellent](//www.epa.gov/insect-repellents). In Letter to Maine's Congressional Delegation, Governor Mills Urges Federal Government To Provide Funding to Address PFAS Contamination; Outlines Regulatory Actions to Assist Maine's Response March 31, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA, Maine - In a letter to Maine's Congressional Delegation, Governor Janet Mills this week requested that the Federal government provide dedicated funding to address the growing issue of PFAS both in Maine and across the country. The Governor, who thanked the Congressional Delegation for their ongoing work on the issue, also outlined a slate of steps the Federal government could take to assist Maine in its efforts to address PFAS contamination. \"Contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has emerged as a serious issue in Maine, including impacting public and private drinking water and some farms to date,\" wrote Governor Mills. \"Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF), and Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) need critical resources to better determine, assess, and mitigate PFAS contamination in the state, as well as support those with contaminated lands and/or water.\" The Governor's message included six detailed actions her administration will take around PFAS. She also suggested eleven critical regulatory and funding actions for a national strategy to support a PFAS response. \"With an infusion of federal funds, Maine could more broadly and aggressively undertake these critically needed actions,\" Governor Mills wrote. \"PFAS contamination is not a Maine problem; it is a national problem that ultimately requires a federal response. [...] Maine is currently on the front edge of PFAS discovery and response, and by having the resources and support in the form of Federal leadership as we navigate this incredibly complex and devastating issue, it will ultimately benefit other states as they begin to grapple with the impacts of PFAS contamination.\" The full text of the letter is available below: March 25, 2021 The Honorable Susan Collins The Honorable Angus King The Honorable Chellie Pingree The Honorable Jared Golden Re: Request for federal funding to address contamination from per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) Dear Senators Collins and King, and Representatives Pingree and Golden, As you know, contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has emerged as a serious issue in Maine, including impacting public and private drinking water and some farms to date. Maine's Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF), and Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) need critical resources to better determine, assess, and mitigate PFAS contamination in the state, as well as support those with contaminated lands and/or water. Maine needs immediate federal funding to begin taking the following actions: - Ramp up efforts to protect citizens from exposure to unsafe levels of PFAS, including by addressing PFAS in wastewater treatment plant residuals, landfill leachate, fire-fighting foam, or other sources. - Expand sampling and analysis of water, soil, milk, animal feed, and other media. - Expand live and post-mortem sampling and analysis of livestock. - Provide funding to install water treatment to remove PFAS from impacted drinking water sources. - Provide direct financial support so farms facing PFAS contamination can remain viable and citizens can obtain water treatment systems and support. - Partner with our land grant and other research universities to expand PFAS research and PFAS-mitigation and remediation strategies specific to Maine's natural resource and climate conditions. Our agencies are currently hard at work responding to the emerging threat of PFAS. However, with an infusion of federal funds, Maine could more broadly and aggressively undertake these critically needed actions. Of course, PFAS contamination is not a Maine problem; it is a national problem that ultimately requires a federal response. In addition to supporting our state-led efforts, we encourage the federal government to act quickly and decisively in its own right. We strenuously urge the following regulatory and funding actions: - Congress should add PFAS to the hazardous substance list under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), with some exceptions for entities such as water and wastewater utilities. - The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should expeditiously establish a Maximum Contaminant Level for PFAS in drinking water. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) should apply that same standard to bottled water. - The EPA should move expeditiously with its development of IRIS toxicity values for other PFAS that are needed now to assess the presence in the environment. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry should finalize toxicity values for PFAS commonly found in environmental samples. - The EPA should certify additional laboratory methods to measure PFAS in various media (groundwater, wastewater, soils, and other solids, and ambient air). - The EPA should publish and update Regional Screening Levels to include additional screening level guidelines for PFAS as toxicity levels become available. - The EPA and USDA should invest in agronomic research so we can better understand PFAS uptake into plants and animals to help reduce PFAS exposure in our food supply and promote farm viability. This research should include the investigation of PFAS uptake from residual treated soils and soil-to-groundwater modeling, as well as the investigation of PFAS tolerant crops that can be grown safely on contaminated land. - The USDA should improve and expand the Farm Service Agency's Dairy Indemnity Payment Program (DIPP) to provide funding support for all farmers impacted by PFAS contamination-including animal feed, livestock, and specialty crop growers as well as dairy producers. The program's timeframe for support should increase from 18 months to 36. Payments to farmers for the value of their livestock should be included, as well as to cover depopulation expenses. Improving the DIPP program should continue to fund income replacement and grow to underwrite costs (including testing and remediation) associated with a longer-term return to farm viability. - The FDA should establish PFAS adulteration levels for foods and regulatory limits for food packaging to minimize dietary exposures. - The FDA should expand its published testing methodologies for PFAS in food. - The federal government should require manufacturers to reduce and eliminate the use of PFAS in non-essential applications, with particular focus on those uses with the highest potential for human exposure. Manufacturers (domestic and foreign) of consumer products should be required to report their use of PFAS compounds in products sold in the United States. - The federal government should invest further in research into PFAS health effects, environmental fate and transport, and treatment and destruction technologies. As outlined above, there are urgent needs in Maine that need to be addressed at both the federal and state level. Maine is currently on the front edge of PFAS discovery and response, and by having the resources and support in the form of Federal leadership as we navigate this incredibly complex and devastating issue, it will ultimately benefit other states as they begin to grapple with the impacts of PFAS contamination. Your ongoing advocacy on behalf of the health of our wonderful state is greatly appreciated, and I thank you for all that you do on a daily basis to improve the lives of all Mainers. Sincerely, Janet T. Mills Governor DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal Presents Maine Forest Ranger With Nation's Highest Award for Wildfire Prevention April 13, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Governor Mills proclaims April 18-24 Wildfire Awareness Week AUGUSTA - At a Blaine House Ceremony today, Maine Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal presented Maine Forest Service Ranger Specialist Kent Nelson with the Silver Smokey Bear Award, the highest national honor one can receive for outstanding work and significant program impact in wildfire prevention. Ranger Nelson is one of two people to earn this national recognition in 2021. \"Maine is the most heavily forested state in the country, which means that wildfire prevention is something that we must take very seriously,\" said Governor Mills. \"It is why Maine Forest Service Rangers, like Ranger Specialist Kent Nelson, are so important. Their efforts, along with those of fire departments across Maine, are critical to keeping our state safe. I am honored to congratulate Specialist Nelson on this well-deserved recognition and thank him for his efforts to safeguard our forests and protect Maine people.\" \"Creating awareness of ways to reduce human-caused wildfires ignition is a critical role for Maine Forest Service, and Ranger Specialist Kent Nelson is a gifted and talented ambassador to this cause who has repeatedly demonstrated creativity and innovation in crafting and disseminating engaging and effective messaging to educate the public,\" added DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. Smokey Bear awards have been bestowed on well-deserving groups and individuals annually since 1957. The Silver Smokey Bear Award specifically recognizes organizations or individuals for outstanding wildfire prevention service that is regional (multistate) in scope over at least a two-year period. The National Association of State Foresters, the USDA Forest Service, and The Ad Council sponsor the Awards, and nominations are considered and voted upon by members of the Cooperative Forest Fire Prevention Committee. Maine Forest Service Director and State Forester Patty Cormier and Chief Forest Ranger Bill Hamilton joined Governor Mills and DACF Commissioner Beal to present Ranger Nelson with the award today. Ranger Nelson has worked in the Maine Forest Service for two decades, serving as Maine's wildfire prevention specialist a role in which he administers Maines wildfire prevention and FireWise programs and raises public awareness on how to prevent wildfires. In 2019, with Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact colleagues, Ranger Nelson implemented a year-long campaign dedicated to preventing wildfires by celebrating Smokey Bear's 75th birthday. At today's Silver Smokey Bear Award event, the Governor proclaimed April 18-24 as Wildfire Awareness Week in Maine. Maine has already seen over 100 wildfires in 2021, and 2020 was a record-breaking year. During Wildfire Awareness Week, the MFS Forest Protection Division and municipal fire departments need everyone's support to prevent wildfires. Maine averages over 550 wildfires annually, over ninety percent of which are caused by people, destroy valuable natural resources, property, and threaten human life. Wildfire safety starts with knowing and obeying local laws and regulations. Everyone is asked to check with their town hall, local fire service, or the Maine Forest Service before burning. Other critical steps to preventing wildfires include mindfulness of weather conditions, particularly wind, and using only easily controlled locations for burning. Most importantly, never use flammable gas-propellants.

This new invasive plant management program is administered by the MFS and the [Maine Natural Areas Program](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/index.html) (MNAP). Funded by a Landscape Scale Restoration Program grant from the USDA Forest Service, financial incentives for IPCPPs are available to public and private woodland owners with ten to one thousand wooded acres in Maine. The program will reimburse up to 50% of the cost based on the number of acres. An average small woodlot may receive up to $400 maximum incentive; larger lots will have larger maximum incentive amounts. The IPCPP provides woodland owners with maps and treatment recommendations for invasive plants. The program's goal is to address invasive plants that choke out native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers in the eligible woodlands. A corps of natural resource professionals trained through the program's Invasive Plant Academy will be qualified to develop the IPCPPs. A list of trained plan preparers will be available on the [MFS Invasive Plant Management Program web page](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/projects/invasive_plant_mgmt/index.html). \"IPCPPs are an important tool for managing and controlling invasive plants across our state, and a great resource for landowners,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"We are pleased to offer this assistance to communities, land trusts and other non-profit groups, and smaller-acreage private woodland owners,\" said Maine Forest Service Director Patty Cormier. \"We're excited for the opportunity to work with licensed foresters and other natural resource professionals to develop IPCPPs for Maine's woodland owners,\" added MNAP Invasive Plant Biologist Nancy Olmstead. \"After years of seeing these invasive plants becoming worse and worse, it's great to finally have some resources to tackle the problem on the ground,\" noted MFS Landowner Outreach Forester Andy Shultz. Landowners with approved IPCPPs will also be eligible to apply for the next phase of the program to receive free invasive plant treatment conducted by a contractor hired by the Maine Forest Service. - Visit the MFS website for the 2021 IPCPP [application](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/projects/invasive_plant_mgmt/index.html).

Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to continue regulating the movement of emerald ash borer April 28, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA - On January 14, 2021 the federal quarantine regulations restricting the movement of the emerald ash borer (EAB) were removed by the USDA to refocus their resources on biological control of the pest. Despite the USDA's shift in emphasis, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) Maine Forest Service (MFS) and Plant Health Program (PHP) will continue to regulate the movement of EAB because an estimated 90 percent of Maine's ash trees remain outside of the currently regulated quarantine areas. Approximately four percent of trees in Maine's hardwood forests are ash. In addition to its roles in the forest ecosystem, white ash is a valuable timber species, green ash is an important street tree and black/brown ash is an important cultural resource for the Wabanaki Tribes. EAB threatens all these species of ash trees (but not mountain-ash, Sorbus spp.) and will have significant ecological and economic impacts on the state. There are no practical means to control EAB in forested areas, though pesticide treatments can protect individual trees. DACF continues to see opportunities to slow the spread of this devastating insect and has amended the EAB quarantine effective April 21, 2021. What You Need To Know - An exterior quarantine was added to the EAB rules. The amended state quarantine rules add prohibition on movement of potentially EAB infested materials into the State of Maine from other states and/or from Canadian provinces formerly included in the federal regulation. - The amended rule also expands the regulated area in northern Maine. The rule as adopted adds the towns of Caswell, Connor Township and New Sweden to the existing Aroostook County quarantine area to provide a buffer around the latest EAB find in Van Buren (see map). It also adds the towns of Saint John Plantation, Saint Francis and Allagash to the west of the existing quarantine to help facilitate movement of firewood for home heating (see map). - The new rule eases the restrictions on the movement of hardwood and ash wood chips. The restrictions on movement of composted or uncomposted chips of the genus Fraxinus are removed. The level of risk of spread of EAB from movement of chips is not enough to balance the amount of resources required to regulate that product. Removing this restriction is not expected to significantly increase the potential for EAB spread. - BMPs are still very important even inside the quarantine areas. Despite the expansion of the northern Aroostook regulated area MFS and the PHP encourage all who are involved in moving ash tree products to follow [Best Management Practices](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/documents/Ash_regulated_area-BMP.pdf). Even within regulated areas, spread of EAB can be reduced through these important steps. More information on EAB can be found on the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's [EAB website](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/index.shtml). Questions about the quarantine rule can be directed to [gary.fish@maine.gov](mailto:gary.fish@maine.gov) or by telephone at 207-287-7545. Supporting documents New Program Makes SNAP/EBT Processing Equipment Available to Farmers and Farmers' Markets at No Cost May 6, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA- Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) Electronic Benefits Transfer card (EBT) equipment is available to agricultural producers and farmers' markets in Maine. Interested producers and farmers markets should visit the [Farm Food Access Program](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/business_and_market_development/farm-food-access-program/) (FFAP) website or call the [Maine Federation of Farmers' Markets ](//mffm.org)(MFFM) to learn about the options for cost-free equipment. By accepting SNAP/EBT, producers and farmers markets help feed approximately one in eight Mainers participating in the SNAP Program. The FFAP, developed by the Maine Bureau of Agriculture, Maine Department of Health and Human Services, and MFFM, launched in 2020 to provide more opportunities for individuals and families to purchase local foods with their federal SNAP benefits. FFAP positively benefits Maine's economy by increasing the number of farms and farmers' markets in Maine accepting SNAP benefits. More than $200 million in SNAP food dollars is spent each year by families, seniors, and income-eligible individuals in Maine. Programs such as FFAP enable more farm businesses to participate, increasing the number of sites at which Mainers can use their SNAP benefits. To date, FFAP has helped more than 30 producers and farmers' markets acquire equipment and accept SNAP transactions. \"Our neighbors were so excited that they could keep their SNAP dollars local and support our farm,\" says Cynthia Turcotte, owner of Applewald Farm. Based in Litchfield, ME, Applewood Farm is one of the many farm stands in the program. MFFM reports that over $250,000 in federal SNAP benefits were spent with local farms in 2020. MFFM provides additional consultation to interested applicants to attracting new customers using SNAP to their markets and farm stands. \"Due to the pandemic, we saw record numbers of SNAP sales being spent on local food. People preferred to shop in less crowded and open-air places, when possible,\" says Jimmy DeBiasi, the Director of Programs at MFFM. \"The timing of FFAP has been remarkable, as it offered people who shop with SNAP new places to access fresh, local, and healthy food in safe environments.\" Learn more about the [Farm Food Access Program and access the online application form](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ffap/). Organizations with a stake in the agricultural solar siting process to participate in stakeholder group May 27, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) and the Maine Governor's Energy Office (GEO) are convening a stakeholder group to consider the opportunities and challenges presented by solar energy development on agricultural land in Maine. The group will meet monthly throughout the summer and fall and present a report with potential policy and other recommendations to the Legislature in January 2022. The first stakeholder group Zoom conference call is scheduled for Thursday, June 3, 2021, from 9:00 am - noon. Meeting details for this and all meetings will be posted to the [Maine.gov Public Meetings Calendar.](//www.maine.gov/portal/government/calendar.shtml) Across Maine and New England, previously undeveloped farmland and forestland have become potential sites for solar energy installations. In December 2020, the state's four-year climate action plan, [Maine Won't Wait](//climatecouncil.maine.gov/), recommended that the state work with stakeholders to develop policies for Maine that thoughtfully balance the siting of renewable projects with the protection of natural and working lands. In 2019, Maine law changed to encourage solar development. Solar developers are actively working to secure potential sites for solar installations, including agricultural land. Recent reports from other New England states suggest that much of the land used will be previously undeveloped farmland and forestland. \"The Department supports the State's goals for reducing dependence on fossil fuels and pursuing renewable energy generation. At the same time, prime soils and soils of statewide importance are finite, and they are key to Maine's current and future agricultural productivity, climate resiliency, and food security. Finding the right policies, incentives, and parameters to help balance these interests are critical,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"Developing renewable energy is key to achieving Maine's bold climate and clean energy targets, fighting climate change, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels, and creating good-paying jobs around the state,\" said Celina Cunningham, Deputy Director of the Governor's Energy Office. \"This stakeholder process will help inform how to properly site solar projects, to both protect valuable natural and working lands and maximize benefits to Maine people and communities.\" Stakeholders include 15 Maine agricultural community representatives, renewable energy developers, municipal representatives, conservation advocates, and relevant state agencies. - Celina Cunningham, Governor's Energy Office (Co-Chair) - Nancy McBrady, DACF (Co-Chair) - Nick Armentrout, Spring Creek Farm - Emily Cole, American Farmland Trust - Heather Donahue, Balfour Farm - Ellen Griswold, Maine Farmland Trust - Sarah Haggerty, Maine Audubon - Kaitlin Hollinger, BlueWave - Matt Kearns, Energy - Fortunat Mueller, ReVision Energy - George O'Keefe, Town of Rumford - Jeremy Payne, Maine Renewable Energy Association - Andy Smith, The Milkhouse - Julie Ann Smith, Maine Farm Bureau - Patrick Wynne, City of Hallowell Interested in the Agricultural Solar Stakeholder Group? - [Sign up for the interested parties list](//forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=q6g_QX0gYkubzeoajy-GTma3J5OEd7dJsXToW_sOdrlUODZWSTNWTzVTUExCU0o2RlAyNjJRNDhWVC4u) Take the Real Maine Pledge, Support Maine Food and Agricultural Producers May 27, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Agricultural Fairs and Open Farm Day Return for summer 2021 AUGUSTA - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry invites everyone to take the Real Maine pledge by opting for Maine-grown, raised, and made products this summer and always.

Bureau of Parks and Lands : Browntail Moth Alert June 10, 2021 The browntail moth has been in Maine for over a century, and we are currently experiencing a population outbreak. The continued hot, dry conditions are contributing to its population growth and spread throughout the state. At present, parts of Cumberland County and Maine's midcoast and Capital regions are experiencing the worst of the outbreak. This area includes Bradbury Mountain, Camden Hills, Lake St. George, and Warren Island State Parks. Browntail moth caterpillar hairs can cause a skin rash on humans like that caused by poison ivy and difficulty breathing when inhaled. The browntail caterpillar's emergence during spring is terrible timing for those planning visits during May and June. Browntail caterpillars mature in late June or early July, pupate in their cocoons, and emerge as moths approximately two weeks later. During late July early August, the risk for browntail moth activity and exposure declines. With browntail moth hairs remaining in the environment, the risk of exposure is continuous in dry conditions. We ask everyone to review the commonly asked questions located on the Maine Forest Service Website and visit the Maine CDC website for more information. Many of our State Parks are not affected by browntail moth, and we are happy to assist with camping reservations in other areas or make alternate recommendations. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused by the browntail population outbreak. Maine's Forest Action Plan Earns USDA USDA Forest Service Approval June 23, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [jim.britt@maine.gov](mailto:jim.britt@maine.gov) 10-Year Strategic Document Will Help Guide State's Forest Management Actions AUGUSTA-The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Maine Forest Service (MFS) has received official approval for its 2020 Forest Action Plan from the USDA Forest Service. The plan is a ten-year strategic document designed to help guide policies, priorities, and actions to conserve Maine's forest resources. Maine's Forest Action Plan analyzes current conditions and trends of Maines trees and forests and provides strategies and actions to ensure a sustainable future for the state's forests. The program is complementary to the Maine Climate Council's recommendations in \" [Maine Wont Wait](//www.maine.gov/future/sites/maine.gov.future/files/inline-files/MaineWontWait_December2020.pdf),\" as well as the [State Wildlife Action Plan](//www.maine.gov/IFW/fish-wildlife/wildlife/wildlife-action-plan.html) and other planning documents. All US states and territories must have Forest Action Plans to receive federal aid through USDA Forest Service's State Private Forestry programs. A US Farm Bill requirement designed to support private woodland owner stewardship, urban and community forestry, and assistance to rural fire departments. \"This is the culmination of a great deal of hard work, research, and input by MFS staff, partner agencies, stakeholders, and members of the public,\" commented State Forester Patty Cormier. \"We appreciate the USDA Forest Service's acceptance of Maine's 2020 Forest Action Plan and look forward to using it as an important tool in Maine's forest policy toolbox.\" Forest Action Plans assess the condition of Maine's trees and forests, regardless of ownership, and develop strategies to conserve working forest landscapes, protect forests from harm, and enhance public benefits from trees and forests. In addition, the plans offer practical, comprehensive roadmaps for investing federal, state, local, and private resources where they can be most effective in achieving state and national forest conservation goals. Having a Forest Action Plan also allows MFS to compete regionally for additional grants designed to address priorities and implement strategies identified in the plan.

Maine's iconic Tumbledown Mountain, well known for its accessibility to many hiking skill levels, western mountain views, and alpine pond located just below the summit, is one location that has been impacted by such misuse. Dispersed campers are heavily impacting the mountain with discarded equipment, fire damage, cutting down trees, trampling vegetation, and leaving behind human and dog feces. As a result, all camping areas on Tumbledown Mountain are now closed. Park Rangers and Maine Forest Service Rangers will be on patrol and on the lookout for illegal camping and illegal fire activity on the mountain. \"While the recent increase in outdoor recreation is good for everyone, ongoing disregard for Tumbledown Mountain's rules is damaging fragile habitat and creating an unwelcoming environment for visitors,\" commented BPL Deputy Director Bill Patterson. \"Our role is to care for Maine's treasured outdoor spaces so that the thousands of hikers who love and respect the mountain will find a more enjoyable environment today and for generations to come.\" Hikers are invited to help. Be familiar with the seven [Leave No Trace principles](//lnt.org/why/7-principles), and educate others, especially children, about protecting the outdoors. Report camping, campfires, or other illegal use of the mountain by contacting BPL's Western Public Lands Office, 129 Main Street in Farmington, at (207) 778-8231. Nearby camping alternatives. Tumbledown Mountain is located nearby [Mount Blue State Park](//www.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/doc/parksearch/details.pl?park_id=18) and [Rangeley Lakes State Park](//www.maine.gov/cgi-bin/online/doc/parksearch/details.pl?park_id=25).

Hikers can find additional camping options on the [Maine Campground Owners Association website](//campmaine.com/). Tumbledown Public Lands Camping Prohibition Q&A Q: Why is the BPL prohibiting camping at Tumbledown? A: The BPL has decided to prohibit camping on Tumbledown Mountain to improve the day-use hiking experience for the thousands of individuals, families, and groups who visit the mountain annually. Tumbledown lands are not designated or managed for camping, and the summit area has become a busy informal campsite with dozens of campers crowding in, especially on summer weekends. The summit's fragile ecosystem, which provides habitat for native plants and wildlife, is especially susceptible to damage due to the harsh climate and thin soils. In addition to the impact on the environment, a notable minority of campers often create a disturbance with music, litter, and unauthorized fires. Beyond the difficulty and expense of staff removing the trash and human waste, the general disregard for the mountain and other visitors is not sustainable. Q: What is the BPL policy and process to regulate camping? A: The BPL makes land management decisions based on our [Integrated Resource Policy](//www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/publications_maps/index.shtml), unit management plans, and professional judgment to protect natural resources and provide for public recreation. After careful consideration, including public input during the 2020-21 management planning process for Tumbledown, the BPL determined it is in the best interest of the environment and public enjoyment to eliminate camping at Tumbledown altogether. As part of management planning, the Bureau works to carefully locate and design primitive campsites on the Public Lands, over 200 of which have been designated. While some will be disappointed, others will find a greatly improved atmosphere and environment as they enjoy the summit. As with some of Maine's other most notable peaks, such as Katahdin and Cadillac Mountain, overnight camping is not compatible in such busy, fragile locations. Q: What alternatives exist to camping at Tumbledown? A: For those seeking the enjoyment of an overnight camping trip coupled with climbing Tumbledown, the nearby Mt. Blue State Park and Rangeley Lakes campgrounds provide excellent camping locations near the Tumbledown hike. [Private campgrounds](//campmaine.com/) may also be found in the surrounding area within a 45-minute drive of the trailhead. For those looking to replicate a remote backcountry camping experience, several trail systems are designed to accommodate overnight hikers, including sections of the Appalachian Trail at the nearby Four Ponds, Mahoosuc, and Bigelow Public Lands. [MaineTrailFinder.com](//www.mainetrailfinder.com/) is a good resource for finding and planning hiking trips, including extended overnight hikes.

Supported by a grant from the USDA Forest Service, financial incentives for these plans are available to public and private woodland owners with ten to one thousand wooded acres in Maine. Reimbursement of up to 50% of the cost of an IPCPP is based on the number of acres covered in the plan. An average woodlot with between 10 and 100 acres may receive up to $400 maximum incentive; larger lots will have larger maximum incentive amounts. The plans will provide woodland owners with maps and treatment recommendations for invasive plants on their land. The second round of applications for these plans opens on June 28, 2021 and closes on July 12, 2021. This new Invasive Plants Management Program is administered by Maine Forest Service, with close support from the Maine Natural Areas Program; both agencies are part of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. The program's primary goal is to address invasive plants that choke out native trees, shrubs and wildflowers. A corps of natural resource professionals trained through the program's Invasive Plant Academy are eligible to develop IPCPPs. A list of trained plan preparers is available on the [Maine Forest Service's Invasive Plant Management Program web page](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/projects/invasive_plant_mgmt/index.html). \"We're very excited for the opportunity to work with licensed foresters and other natural resource professionals to develop Invasive Plant Control plans for Maine's woodland owners,\" said Nancy Olmstead, Invasive Plant Biologist with the Maine Natural Areas Program. When implemented, these plans will \"help slow the advance of exotic invasive plants in Maine's treasured woodlands.\" \"After years of seeing these invasive plants becoming worse and worse, it's great to finally have some resources to tackle the problem on the ground,\" noted Andy Shultz, the Maine Forest Services Landowner Outreach Forester. Landowners with approved IPCPPs will be eligible to apply for the next phase of the program, to receive free invasive plant treatment conducted by a contractor hired by the Maine Forest Service. - To apply for a 2021 Invasive Plant Control Practice Plan, applicants must complete the [application available](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/projects/invasive_plant_mgmt/documents/IPCP_practice%20plan_application_May2021_fillable.pdf).

Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry announces resources to help foodservice businesses affected by supply chain bottlenecks July 15, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Augusta - To assist business owners facing food supply disruptions, the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) has compiled a [new resource](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/business_and_market_development/market_development/wholesale-suppliers.shtml) highlighting wholesale procurement channels available for agricultural and seafood products, including distributors, cooperatives, and direct-to-producer options. The [Maine Wholesale Foodservice Distributors](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/business_and_market_development/market_development/wholesale-suppliers.shtml#distributors) for Institutional Buyers list was also created in response to food supply issues facing some Maine summer camps and restaurants. DACF's Maine Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources (BAFRR) invites food producers with wholesale capacity within the state's local food network to complete a [brief questionnaire](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/business_and_market_development/market_development/wholesale-suppliers.shtml#about) to determine capacity to be added to the online resource. \"We are committed to doing all that we can to help to make connections for our farmers,\" commented Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources Director Nancy McBrady. \"DACF is working to gather data and stakeholder input surrounding food infrastructure needs in the state, while we remain dedicated to better understanding and addressing those needs.\" \"The good news is that Maine farmers, growers, and harvesters are hard at work, and we are entering the peak of production, so there is plenty of food available locally,\" commented DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"Buyers may have to work through new channels to get all of the products they are looking for, or align their menus with food that is in season, which could ultimately help to build resilience in their food programs by diversifying sources, as well as benefit Maine's farmers, fishermen, and communities directly.\" DACF reminds individuals, restaurants, caterers, and institutions to become acquainted with the department's Real Maine program. [Real Maine](//realmaine.com) is created and administered by DACF's BAFRR. It is a publicly available online resource designed to connect consumers with Maine farmers and food producers. (Discover [www.realmaine.com](//realmaine.com)) Reuters [recently reported](//www.reuters.com/business/stretched-global-supply-chain-means-shortages-summer-menus-2021-06-28/) that restaurants are facing shortages of key ingredients and products due to supply bottlenecks. In the same report, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said food supply bottlenecks could continue \"well into 2022.\" Current supply-chain issues reinforce the need for Maine to pursue more efforts to support robust and resilient food systems, including rebuilding critical food processing infrastructure. Additionally, in [Maine Won't Wait](//www.maine.gov/future/sites/maine.gov.future/files/inline-files/MaineWontWait_December2020.pdf), the state's four-year climate action plan released last December, Maine's Climate Council set far-reaching goals, including increasing the amount of food consumed in Maine from state food producers from 10% to 30% by 2030 through local food system development. That will require research, development, and planning to support the growth and resilience of Maine's food system. In response to this need, DACF and the Departments of Marine Resources and Economic and Community Development recently surveyed Maine's agriculture, forestry, and fisheries sectors to determine infrastructure investment priorities in these heritage industries. [Responses](//legislature.maine.gov/doc/6726) helped identify opportunities for businesses growth, including expanded onsite storage and increased co-packing options, particularly for growing grain, meat, dairy, vegetable, and fruit production. With targeted support, DACF aims to continue working to build a springboard for sustainable growth of Maine's agricultural economy in a way that benefits producers, consumers, and foodservice businesses alike.

Maine Forestry Museum Inducts Four Trailblazing Women Into Hall of Fame July 22, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA - The Maine Forestry Museum honored four Hall of Fame inductees during their recent Logging Festival Days in Rangeley. The 2021 inductees are the first women to receive this honor. Inductees for 2021 include Mary Dunham of Avon; Sarah Medina of Dixmont; Patricia Quinn of Norridgewock; and Patty Cormier of Farmington, who also serves as Maine's State Forester and directs the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Bureau of Forestry. The induction honors took place during the Logging Festival, Saturday, July 17. \"Every day hardworking members of the forestry community in Maine contribute to our economy, supply markets near and far with world-class lumber, and preserve and protect our working woods as they have for generations. Today it is my honor to celebrate four outstanding women whose hard work has shaped the forest industry and our state,\" said Governor Mills. \"I join with everyone across Maine in congratulating Mary Dunham, Sarah Medina, Patricia Quinn, and Patty Cormier on being named to the Maine Forestry Museum Hall of Fame.\" \"These four amazing people represent a wealth of experience and history in their field,\" said Maine Forestry Museum Board Member Scott Stevens. \"We could not be prouder to add them to the roster of legends in the Maine Forestry Museum.\" \"I congratulate each of this year's Maine Forestry Museum Hall of Fame inductees and thank them for their hard work and leadership,\" said Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"I am especially proud to see Patty Cormier included as an inductee. Patty rises to every challenge and Maine is very lucky to have her as our State Forester.\" Meet the Maine Forestry Museum 2021 Hall of Fame Inductees Mary Dunham of Avon logged with horses for more than ten years. She worked with her husband, Bruce Dunham, on woodlots in Avon and the Rangeley area, starting around 1975. They cut a lot of softwood during the spruce budworm infestation in the following years. As landowners, they tried to salvage some value from the trees being killed by these insects. Mary was often driving a single horse and worked with many different ones over the years. Her favorite was a Percheron named Charlie. Mary liked Charlie best because he would stand quietly and not make a move until she told him to. Charlie weighed in at over a ton. Mary said that if it was a short distance from the stump to the landing, she could yard about a wheeler truckload in a day (approximately 8-9 cords.) Sometimes, she would twitch with a single horse to the main trail if it was further to the yard. Then Bruce would take multiple trees from there to the main yard with a pair of horses and a \"yarding rig\" on wheels. Mary grew up on the west coast of the United States. Her father was in the military, and they moved around. She described her upbringing as suburban and not around horses or the woods. Bruce showed her the basics of driving and handling the horse, and she learned by experience after that. She remembers going to work after thirty inches of snow fell in one storm and thought she would never get through this. She said, \"You start out with a short, eight-foot log that the horse can move. Once the horse starts a trail with that log, you tread down a path, and after a while, you can keep going.\" Working with the horse was physically challenging but also physically rewarding. Mary said that she usually just had on a turtleneck, wool sweater, long johns, and wool pants and was warm even on the coldest winter days. Because the horses were in such good physical shape from work, Mary had a lot of success in pulling contests at Maine fairs. Mary learned that the job included a sense of direction in the woods that she never had before and about the different species of trees and how each has other characteristics, including different weights and smells. Mary said some of her greatest satisfaction during this career was the relationship she built with the horse, the pride in the good job that horses can do on a woodlot, and the profit margin they saw instead of when they had heavy equipment payments. After her logging career, Mary and Bruce had a successful seafood business in Avon and Rangeley. She and Bruce still reside in Avon, and Mary is employed in the Avon town Office. Sarah Medina of Dixmont is a 1972 graduate of the University of Maine with a B.S. in Forest Management. She was the first woman to pursue a forest management degree at U.M. and the first woman employed as a field forester in Maine. Sarah retired in 2019 after a gratifying career with Seven Islands Land Company, working in both the Rangeley region and northern Maine. She enjoys three seasons at camp in the Narrows at Richardson Lake and winters on Maine's snowmobile trails. Sarah's early experience included typical foresters' duties. It gave her the essential foundation for all the work she did throughout her career. Over time, her job evolved to work in recreation administration, regulatory compliance, taxation, communications, land ownership, and policy. She administered recreational management on lands managed by Seven Islands. She worked with state agencies to manage natural resources and has served on numerous advisory committees and task forces that influence and enhance state land use and regulatory policy and/or enhance forest management. Sarah currently serves on the Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust Board of Directors, Baxter State Park Scientific Forest Management Area Advisory Committee, the Maine Indian Tribal-State Commission, the Maine Board of Licensure of Professional Foresters, and Project Learning Tree Steering Committee. A Lifetime member and Gold Award Girl Scout, she has experience in all aspects of Girl Scouting, from Brownie to council president, and recently retired from the Board of Directors of Girl Scouts of Maine. Sarah was recognized as the 2015 Distinguished Alumnus, U.M. School of Forest Resources. She received the 2010 Presidents Award and the 2018 Abby Holman Public Service Award from the Maine Forest Products Council. In 2008 she was recognized by the Northern Loggers Association for outstanding service to the forest industry. Patricia Quinn of Norridgewock has over 30 years of experience in forestry in Maine and currently serves as the Harvest and Transportation Manager for the Three Rivers District of the Weyerhauser Corporation. The responsibilities of that position include the planning and execution of wood products harvests on Weyerhauser lands primarily west of the Kennebec River in Franklin and Somerset Counties. She supervises a team of three professional foresters, building long-term relationships with logging contractors, administering harvest contracts, ensuring compliance with Best Management Practices, all government rules and laws regarding the harvests, and delivery and marketing of the forest products. Quinn grew up in Connecticut and took an interest in outdoor activities like camping early on. She served three years active duty in the United States Marine Corps before earning her associate degree from Paul Smith's College and then her bachelor's degree in Forest Management from the University of Maine. She went on to earn her MBA at Thomas College. With the Army Reserves from 1991 to 2006, Quinn continued her military service and then with the Maine Army National Guard until she retired as a Master Sergeant (E-8) in 2018. Quinn's first full-time forestry position was with Boise Cascade in Rangeley, commencing in June of 1990. She was a field forester overseeing pre-commercial thinning and hand logging crews primarily. Some of her early mentors were Sammie Spaulding, Stan Bartash, and John Ackley. Quinn says that the most satisfying part of her work has been improving timber stands and setting up large parcels of land for future growth. She adds that commercial forest management is done on a scale that is hard for some people to understand, and they may not recognize beneficial forest management practices at first glance. In 2014, Quinn was recognized for her professional efforts by being named the Maine Forest Products Council Forester of the Year. She is understandably proud of this appreciation for her work in the forests of Maine. Quinn works out of the Bingham office for Weyerhauser and resides in Norridgewock with her husband, Mike. Patty Cormier of Farmington is the current Maine State Forester, the first woman to hold this position. As Maine's Forest Service Director, she oversees three divisions in the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Bureau of Forestry: Forest Policy and Management, Forest Protection (Maine Forest Rangers), and Forest Health and Monitoring. Patty spent twenty years (1999-2019) as a District Forester in the Maine Forest Service. In this role, she conducted outreach and education about all things relating to Maine forestry to the public, landowners, loggers, and other foresters. She spent the first eight years of this career in Mid-Coast Maine and the latter twelve in the Western Mountains. Other duties included education, intervention, and enforcement of forestry-related laws, including providing expert witness testimony in timber trespass and theft cases. Patty attributes her interest in a forestry career to her upbringing in Kingfield, where her parents operated a set of sporting camps near Tufts Pond. She was influenced by her experiences there, enjoying fishing, teaching camp guests about the local forest, and putting up firewood with her father. Two summers spent working at Baxter State Park doing trail work with the Youth Conservation Corps also helped guide Patty to a career outdoors. Patty is one of three Baxter State Park Authority members. She entered Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania as a pre-med student, then quickly became one of two forestry students at that college. The next year, she transferred to the University of Maine at Orono because it had a larger program with more forestry students. She graduated from UMO with her B.S. in Forest Management. Before her career as a District Forester, Patty worked ten years for Georgia Pacific Corporation (GPC) as a Forest Inventory Supervisor and Landowner Assistance Forester. She supervised up to 17 interns performing forest inventory on GPC lands in Hancock and Washington Counties. She also provided forestry management assistance to landowners, including writing forestry plans and supervising harvests. Patty has had a long and extensive public service career in firefighting and Emergency Medical Services. She is an active Advanced EMT with NorthStar Ambulance and a certified firefighter with Farmington Fire and Rescue Department. She has been on six different two-week deployments fighting wildfires in western states and Quebec province, a part of her career which she has found particularly exciting. Patty noted that her woodland firefighting career started when she was working for GPC in Washington county. When she initially expressed interest in helping the local fire chief, he told her that the firefighters' auxiliary baked cookies and cakes. She replied that she didn't want to bake, she wanted to help fight fires! She got her chance and said that the same chief turned out to be a great mentor. In addition to her service to her community and the people of the state of Maine, Patty is particularly proud of having hiked the entire Appalachian Trail in five months, before there were cell phones and technology to rely on. The Maine Forestry Museum is committed to preserving the rich cultural heritage of forestry and conservation in the State of Maine so that it may be shared with generations to come. The museum is located at 221 Stratton Road, Route 16, Rangeley, ME 04970. Visit in person during the summer months from 10 am to 4 pm, Wednesday to Sunday, through September 5.

Cheesemakers will find the developed information very useful and informative when applying for grants and developing business planning tools. I look forward to learning more about our industry through this program.\" - Heather Donahue, Maine Cheese Guild Secretary and owner of Balfour Farm \"We're excited to trial this technology for medium-scale food processors and are confident we can find ways to streamline our production and minimize the labor issues we've been experiencing. This equipment will also enable us to diminish repetitive tasks and provide a more challenging and rewarding work environment for our staff. Acquiring this equipment had previously seemed out of reach. It aligns with our company's growth, but we wouldn't have been able to acquire the equipment without this grant. The hope is that we can demonstrate that this equipment works and that it will be useful for many other Maine businesses.\" - Simon Frost, Owner, Thirty Acre Farm \"Maine Grains is humbled to receive the Agricultural Development Grant. With its help, Maine Grains will further expand the market for Maine-grown grains by meeting the consumer demand for nutritious, easy-to-prepare meals. The funds will assist with the purchase of infrastructure needed to package and pack existing products more efficiently, include value-added products in our expanding product line, and continue to purchase grain from more than 45 different farms per year.\" Kayla Bess, Sales and Marketing Manager at Maine Grains Learn more about the ADG program and learn about this years grant winners on the [ARD webpage](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/grants/agricultural_development.shtml).

Commissioner Beal Praises Maine Forest Service Firefighters and Support Personnel Assisting with Western Wildfires August 16, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA - \"Our department takes great pride in the Maine Forest Service wildland firefighters and personnel who have chosen to travel west to help battle raging wildfires. I invite all of Maine to join me expressing appreciation for our Rangers, and in keeping them and everyone impacted by these fires in their thoughts during this challenging time,\" - Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal. Maine Forest Service western wildfire mobilizations are an opportunity to assist other states in dire need while providing invaluable experience and training for MFS rangers and firefighters, which allows them to bring those skills back to Maine. The USDA funds wildland firefighting mobilizations. \"When Maine rangers mobilize, it not only helps our sister states, but it also provides valuable training and qualifications for our staff to manage incidents here at home. Additionally, all costs are reimbursed by the requesting agency,\" - MFS Chief Ranger Bill Hamilton Maine has provided an engine and staff for Montana and an Incident Management Team (IMT) of four for Idaho and Ranger to Washington State to help lead air operations so far this year. Mobilizations are 14 days, and every one must pass federal wildland firefighter and wildland fire behavior coursework. Preparation also includes annual refresher coursework and physical test. \"I am happy that the Maine Forest Service can provide help to other states, as they would return the favor if we ever needed it. Our help is always welcomed, and I am so appreciative of the quality assistance the mobilized rangers and firefighters have provided,\" MFS Director and State Forester Patty Cormier.

Attending engine operators hailed from the Maine Army National Guard, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and the Maine Forest Service, New Hampshire Forests and Lands, MassWildlife, the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, and the Maine Chapter of the Nature Conservancy. The participating units brought a diversity of experiences with wildland fire engine operations. The wildland fire engines ranged from the new Type 6 Rosenbauer units used by the Guard to smaller, customized engines used by state agencies. \"This training provided an opportunity for partners in this region to learn from various agencies, experiences, equipment, and interfaces from wildland-urban interface to wildlands,\" commented Kent Nelson, Fire Prevention Specialist with Maine Forest Service. \"Anytime we can partner with outside agencies, its a win-win situation,\" said Col. William Dionne, deputy facilities manager for the Maine Army National Guard. \"This interagency ENOP course brought a diverse group of firefighters together to share experience and sharpen their skills. We manage approximately 8,000 acres in Maine, and were pleased to allow use of the Bog Brook site for this training - all who participated benefitted greatly.\" About the Bog Brook ENOP Participants were organized into field exercise strike teams and introduced safety, mobilization, portable humps, complex hose lays, and engine refill alternatives. During the training, wildland fire engines rotate through stations, including a Simtable exercise (3D interactive simulations), safe engine operation with lights and sirens, technical driving practice, and an obstacle course that include pump-and-roll and water control. During daily engine inspections, strike teams are called to respond to a wildfire scenario, one structure-oriented and the other wildland-oriented. This training was coordinated by the Forest Stewards Guild in collaboration with the Maine Prescribed Fire Council and Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact.

Governor Mills and Commissioner Beal Pledge to Assist Maine Organic Dairy Farms In Wake Of Danone Decision to Not Renew Milk Contracts with 14 Maine Farms August 25, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) (207) 480-0558 AUGUSTA - After Danone, the owner of Horizon Organic, notified 14 Maine organic dairy farms that the global brand intends not to renew contracts for milk with them and other farms across New England, Governor Janet Mills and Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal released the following statement today pledging to assist the 14 Maine farms: \"This is a devastating setback for Maine's organic dairy community and these fourteen farms in particular. Every dairy farm in Maine is important to our state and to our economy. We will work diligently to help those who will be losing their contracts. \"The Department has begun the process of reaching out to the impacted farms, and its Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources is exploring ways to assist these farms in response to this disappointing decision. \"The Department has also started working with Maine's Congressional Delegation and other agriculture industry stakeholders - including the Maine Dairy Industry Association, Maine Organic Milk Producers, Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, University of Maine Cooperative Extension, Maine Farmland Trust, Coastal Enterprises, Inc, Maine Farm Bureau, and Maine Milk Commission to form a working group that will discuss both short- and long-term strategies to help the affected farms and support the ongoing viability of Maines dairy industry. \"Our Administration will continue to support Maines dairy farms and our agricultural community through this challenging time.\" According to Danone, farm contract opportunities will cease in August 2022. Danone also notified farms in New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York that it will also cease contracts with them. Maine Slows Spread of Emerald Ash Borer with Continued Ash Movement Restrictions August 30, 2021 Emergency Order announced to restrict movement of ash tree products and hardwood firewood from additional areas of Oxford County. AUGUSTA - The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's (DACF) Maine Forest Service (MFS) has issued an [Emergency Order](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab-emergencyorder.shtml) to restrict the movement of ash from areas likely to harbor [emerald ash borer (EAB)](//www.maine.gov/eab). This order is in response to detections of EAB in northern Cumberland County and is in addition to the [state quarantine](//www.maine.gov/eab) rule on EAB. Both the order and the quarantine exist to help slow the spread of EAB within Maine. Moving ash infested with EAB can spread this invasive insect to new areas. An estimated 90 percent of Maine's ash trees are outside of Maine's currently regulated areas. Ash is an important cultural resource for the Wabanaki, an important street tree and a valuable timber species, accounting for around four percent of Maine's hardwood forest inventory. EAB threatens all ash tree species (excluding mountain-ash) and will have significant ecological and economic impacts on the state. Although pesticide treatments can protect individual trees, there are no practical means to control EAB in forested areas. What does the order do? The order limits the movement of ash trees for planting and ash tree products such as logs, pulpwood, green lumber, and hardwood firewood from the order area. What is the order area? The order area covers Albany Twp, Lovell, Norway, Otisfield, Oxford, Stoneham, Stow, Sweden, and Waterford in Oxford County. This order area is in addition to areas described in the existing [state quarantine](//www.maine.gov/eab), Maine DACF, Agriculture Rules, Chapter 275, which includes areas in Maine and other states and Canada. How does this impact firewood movement from out-of-state into Maine, such as wood harvested or processed in New Hampshire? Despite the spread of EAB into Maine, the [ban on movement of untreated firewood](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/firewood.shtml) from out-of-state into Maine remains. Many tree-killing insects and diseases in addition to EAB can be moved with firewood. We urge everyone who uses firewood to choose local or heat-treated firewood. If I'm only moving ash tree products within the order or quarantine area, do I need to worry about spreading EAB? EAB is not found everywhere within the order and quarantine areas. The MFS and our partners concerned with the future of ash trees in Maine encourage those involved in moving ash tree material within the regulated areas to [follow Best Management Practices](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/documents/Ash_regulated_area-BMP.pdf) to reduce the spread of EAB. More information on EAB can be found on the department's [EAB website](http://www.maine.gov/eab).

Unveiling Planned for Great Circle Trail on Maine's Nahmakanta Public Reserved Land, Saturday, September 25 September 17, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Commissioner Beal Announces New Maine Recreation Trail AUGUSTA - In celebration of National Public Lands Day on September 25, staff of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's (DACF) Bureau of Parks and Lands (BPL) are honoring the grand opening of the Great Circle Trail, a new 30-mile hiking trail loop on the Nahmakanta Public Reserved Land in the heart of the Katahdin Region. The Great Circle Trail connects the Turtle Ridge Loop, Debsconeag Loop trail, and the Appalachian Trail into one large network. The loop trail can be hiked in bite-sized sections or a multi-day adventure, utilizing eight remote campsites. \"The Great Circle Trail concept has been in the works since 2005, and I thank everyone who has contributed to this significant resource,\" commented DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"The new Great Circle Trail is an exceptional opportunity for hikers of all abilities to get outdoors and experience our gorgeous Nahmakanta Public Reserved Land.\" \"Our dedicated staff has shown great vision and commitment to developing what will surely become one of Maine's top multi-day backpacking trips. This trail offers a fantastic hiking experience in a remote, beautiful setting away from the crowds on busier trails such as the 100-mile Wilderness, Bigelow Preserve, or Tumbledown Public Lands,\" added BPL Director Andy Cutko. Ceremony details: Great Circle Trail Unveiling Who: Everyone is welcome to participate What: Guided hike along short sections of the new Great Circle Trail loop, explaining the unique cultural and natural history of Nahmakanta Public Land. Where: Meet at the new Katahdin View Trailhead (45.694686, -69.170821) on the Penobscot Pond Road on the Nahmakanta Unit. When: Saturday, September 25, starting at 10 a.m. RSVPs are requested by calling the BPL's Bangor Office at (207) 941-4412. Detailed directions will be supplied upon registration. This event is rain or shine. About the Great Circle Trail The total length of the Great Circle Trail is 30 miles. This distance includes segments of multiple trails: 1) two sections of the AT (2.3 miles) are used with permission from the National Park Service and Maine Appalachian Trail Club, 2) 6.5 miles of the Debsconeag Backcountry and 3.7 miles of the Turtle Ridge backcountry trails are used if you opt for the shortest distance across these two stacked loop trail systems, 3) 14.3 miles of the newer, connector trail (all south of the AT; all built since 2005), as well as 4) 1.4 miles of road walking (two sections, to be moved off the road as soon as possible). The trail is designed for foot travel; bikes and motorized use are not allowed. The difficulty rating of the GCT is moderate, occasionally strenuous, with rocks and roots in the trail tread being the major obstacles. However hikers travelling longer distance or the full loop should be experienced in backcountry camping, navigation and safety. The trail has been built to a USDA Forest Service hybrid Trail Class 1 / 2 standard (minimally to moderately developed). The Class 1 standard is used on level sections, with tread often not continuous due to rocks and roots, whereas steeper (sidehill) trail segments have more cut and fill tread surface and wider spots for passing. Both classes use native materials for tread, steps, stepping stones, and bridging. Trail junctions are signed with distances to the next major destination, elevation gains are given for mountainous terrain. There are plans for a few interpretive signs to be installed. The difficulty of the trail is well-balanced by the rewards. Scenic trail features along the 30 miles of the Great Circle include four waterfalls, 11 remote ponds/lakes (seven with campsites), two gorges, and more than five panoramic views from ledges and overlooks.

The plants are only known from a handful of sites in Maine, and the goal is to eliminate them from the state. The public can help by looking for the plants and reporting any suspected locations. Stiltgrass is an annual grass that takes over the forest floor. Stiltgrass thatch builds up and makes it difficult for native trees, shrubs, and wildflowers to establish and grow. The thatch also raises fire risk. Infestations grow rapidly as each plant can produce up to a thousand seeds spreadable by moving water, deer, contaminated soil, dirty boots, or dirty equipment. Two locations of Stiltgrass were detected for the first time in Maine in 2020. Perennial Pepperweed (aka Perennial Pepperwort) is an herbaceous plant that can take over sensitive habitats in salt marshes and sandy beaches. These are rare habitats in Maine and home to rare wildlife. When Perennial Pepperweed takes over, it can make the habitat unsuitable. Perennial Pepperweed can also grow in roadsides, riverbanks, and freshwater marshes. There are dense infestations of Perennial Pepperweed in Massachusetts, but only a handful of sites are known in Maine and New Hampshire. What Can You Do? The most valuable assistance is to review the [MNAP Web Gallery](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/features/invasive_plants/invasives_gallery.htm) and [GoBotany website](//gobotany.nativeplanttrust.org/) to become familiar with the plants and then email suspect photos and location descriptions to [invasives.mnap@maine.gov](mailto:invasives.mnap@maine.gov), or map the location with pictures in the online mapping tool [iMapInvasives](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/features/invasive_plants/imap.htm). This tool allows users to view other mapped locations, explore invasive species, and set up email alerts for areas or species of concern. Newly detected Stiltgrass or Perennial Pepperweed should be removed to keep these invasive plants from damaging Maine's treasured forests and wetlands. DACF will offer support and guidance to affected landowners. Helpful Video Resource The Horticulture Program and the Maine Natural Areas Program (MNAP) recently released a [short video](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB_Oe6GxqHs) about stiltgrass and how to identify it. Stiltgrass is known to spread to new areas on nursery stock; it is important that all nursery people be familiar with this plant to prevent its spread. Key traits to identify Stiltgrass - Leaves are alternate along the stem, 2-4\" long and 1/2\" wide, pointed at both ends - Stripe of reflective hairs along the leaf midrib - Leaf edges and surfaces feel smooth to the touch - Trails along the ground, branching from nodes where it produces \"stilts\" (roots) - Shallow-rooted and easy to pull up - Flowers and sets seed late in the season (September-October); one to three seed spikes at the top of the plant that resemble crabgrass - Stems often develop a reddish tint late in the season Key traits to identify Perennial Pepperweed - Leaves are alternate along the stem, lance-shaped, get smaller closer to the top of the plant - Lower leaves have gentle teeth around the edges; leaves higher on the stem may lack teeth - Stems are smooth and lime green, usually 1-4 feet tall, often multiple stems from one base - Small white flowers with four petals in dense clusters at the top of the plant (late June to late July); tiny fruits are reddish-brown, flat and disc-like - Roots have a strong smell like horseradish Supporting documents [Stiltgrass can form large, dense infestations in forests.

This LMF funding opportunity is the first since 2017 and is the direct result of Governor Mills' proposing and lawmakers approving $40 million over four years to replenish the program in the most recent biennial budget. LMF is the State's primary funding vehicle for conserving land for its natural and recreational value. \"As we push full speed ahead on our economic recovery, now is the time to conserve in perpetuity the natural resources that form the backbone of our rural economy,\" said Governor Janet Mills. \"To sustain our heritage - our farms, forests and working waterfronts, saving them from development and making sure they are forever available to fishermen, families and farmers of Maine - I am excited to issue the first call for proposals since 2017 for the Land for Maine's Future Program. Preserving and protecting our cherished lands is one of our highest callings, and I encourage all who are interested to consider the program.\" \"The LMF Program has a lengthy history of protecting Maine's natural resources, and with this new infusion of funding, will continue advancing its important work on behalf of the people of Maine,\" commented DACF Commissioner Beal. \"This call for proposals will bring forth the next generation of land conservation, including supporting our state climate objectives.\" \"The LMF board and program staff are committed to making funds available to our applicant community as quickly as possible while maintaining a fair and equitable process that focuses on targeted conservation priorities,\" - LMF Director Sarah Demers. \"This opportunity to invest 40 million dollars in Maine's special lands and waters and to work with our amazing conservation partners is a welcome and exciting challenge. Maine people have a long-standing record of supporting the LMF Program, and we all appreciate the leadership of both Governor Mills and the Legislature for making the protection of our state's natural resources a top priority,\" - LMF Board Member Barbara Trafton. \"Maine has made considerable progress in conserving land but there is much more to do. Land for Maine's Future assures that we continue to make progress conserving what we all know and love for future generations,\" - LMF Board Member Don Kleiner. LMF project awards include the conservation of working forests, farms, and commercial waterfronts, public access to our woods and waters, and the protection and management of wildlife. Several program priorities and practices were formalized through the budget bill, including establishing a Community Conservation funding category to replace the local and regional significance categories. Projects addressing climate change and deer habitat will have priority. Additionally, it is now a statutory requirement that, except for working farms and working waterfronts, lands acquired with LMF funds may not prohibit public access, hunting, fishing, and trapping, which has been the practice since the program started more than 30 years ago. LMF is the State of Maine's primary funding vehicle for conserving land for its natural and recreational value. The program was established in 1987 when Maine citizens approved a bond to fund $35 million for the purchase of lands, and the program's priority is to conserve Maine landscape, recognizing that working lands and public access to these lands is critical to preserving Maine's quality of life. Since then, LMF has conserved nearly 604,000 acres of land, more than half of which 333,425 acres has been working lands. This includes 41 farms and 9,755 acres of farmlands and 26 commercial working waterfront properties, along with 1,272 miles of shorelines of rivers, lakes and ponds, 58 miles of coastline, and 158 miles of former railroad corridors for recreational trails. Prior to this $40 million infusion, the fund was nearly depleted. Now that it is replenished, LMF can continue its robust conservation efforts, leveraging Federal funding enacted last year through The Great American Outdoors Act, which is expected to send tens of millions of dollars to the state for protection and conservation efforts.

Protect Maine's Forests and Fields - Dont Purchase or Use Bittersweet or Multiflora Rose in Fall Decorations October 15, 2021 For more information contact: Gary Fish at: [Gary.Fish@maine.gov](mailto:Gary.Fish@maine.gov) The Maine Department of Agricultural, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) urges Mainers to beware of invasive plants that may be used in wreaths, garlands, and other fall decorations. Under Maine law, it is illegal to import or sell invasive plants in any form (plants, seeds, or cuttings) in the state, including vines and fruit used to create decorative wreaths. For complete information on the 33 species banned for importation and sale in Maine, visit the DACF [website](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/horticulture/invasiveplants.shtml). The two most common invasive plants used in wreaths and garlands are Asiatic bittersweet, and multiflora rose. Both plants cause severe environmental damage by invading open fields, forests, wetlands, meadows, and backyards and crowding out native plants. - Asiatic bittersweet kills mature trees through strangling. - Multiflora rose can form impenetrable thickets that keep native plant species. Both species are difficult to control and easily re-sprout after cutting. The placement of wreaths and garlands outdoors or disposing of them in compost piles can lead to new infestations. Birds and other animals also eat the fruit and spread viable seeds into vulnerable forest areas. \"Many invasive plants may seem beautiful but are a serious threat to our natural areas and the wildlife that depends on native plants to sustain them,\" said Maine State Horticulturist Gary Fish. \"It is not legal to sell wreaths that contain these banned species and consumers should look for decorations with native species in them like winterberry holly, red twig dogwood, or American mountain ash.\" The public can report locations where banned plants are being sold to the Maine Horticulture Program at [horticulture@maine.gov](mailto:horticulture@maine.gov) or by calling 207-287-3891. Supporting documents Commentary: Maine needs robust Forest Legacy Program funding October 28, 2021 From Portland Press Herald, October 28, 2021 ( [Read Online](https://www.pressherald.com/2021/10/28/maine-needs-robust-forest-legacy-program-funding/)) The Forest Legacy Program has conserved over 2.8 million acres of working forest lands across the U.S. Maine's woodlands can make important contributions to climate resilience efforts while supporting our vital forest and recreation economies. The time is now for a generational investment in forest conservation and outdoor access for all to provide a sustainable future-both ecologically and economically for Maine and its outdoor way of life. Additionally, we need bold natural climate solutions, such as enhanced forest management, forest restoration, and carbon storage. As Commissioner of Maine's Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF), I was pleased to learn of the U.S. House Agriculture Committee's passage of a budget reconciliation package containing $40 billion dollars in forest-related provisions. That bill includes a critical $1.25 billion investment in the Forest Legacy Program, which helps states and private forest owners maintain working forest lands as a key tool to protect natural infrastructure and support climate resilience. The Forest Legacy Program is a voluntary program responsible for conserving over 2.8 million acres of working forest lands across the U.S., primarily through conservation easement purchases, with more than 50 percent of project costs leveraged from non-federal sources. The program invests in natural infrastructure by conserving forests that sequester carbon dioxide, provide important wildlife habitats, protect our rivers, lakes, and ponds, and secure drinking water supplies. These forested lands offer these benefits while producing timber and providing public recreation access, contributing significantly to Maine's economy via multiple sectors. It's a win-win, a program that works. To date, the program has conserved more than 741,000 acres here in Maine, leveraging $76.1 million in federal funds for a total investment of $146.6 million. Working together with local communities and conservation groups, we have protected places like Katahdin Ironworks, Tumbledown Mountain, West Grand Lake Community Forest, Orbeton Stream, Crocker Mountain, and the Pierce Pond watershed. Maine has two exciting Forest Legacy projects being considered for funding: the 13,000-acre Quill Hill to Perham project near Rangeley and the 10,000-acre Chadbourne Tree Farm project near Bethel. Maine's Congressional delegation supports these projects and has been consistent champions of forest conservation, and we at DACF encourage Senator's King and Collins, and Representatives Pingree and Golden, to also support the forestry provisions in the reconciliation bill and make clear to Congressional leadership that these natural climate solutions should remain in the final reconciliation package.

About LUPC The LUPC is responsible for serving the unorganized and deorganized areas of Maine and helping guide land use across its 10.4 million acres, the largest contiguous undeveloped area in the northeast. The LUPC serves as the planning and zoning authority for the unorganized and deorganized areas of the State, including townships and plantations. These areas either have no local government or have chosen not to administer land use controls at the local level. Along with carrying out its planning and zoning responsibilities, the LUPC issues permits for smaller development projects, such as home construction and camp renovations. For larger development projects requiring Department of Environmental Protection review under the Site Location of Development Law, the LUPC certifies that proposed land uses are allowed and that proposed development activities comply with applicable LUPC land use standards. The Legislature created the Commission to extend principles of sound planning, zoning, and development to the unorganized and deorganized areas of the State.

AUGUSTA - Many Maine residents' holiday celebrations are not complete without decorating with Maine-grown wreaths, trees, and other decorative plant material. Sharing this tradition by sending wreaths and trees to our friends and families across the country can help us feel more connected even if we can't be together this holiday season. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) wants to remind Mainer's sending holiday greenery that they can save time, money and prevent product loss by shipping only healthy plant material. \"Shippers should be aware of the many state laws and regulations regarding the movement of plants and forest products,\" warned Carole Neil, Assistant Horticulturist with DACF. \"Many states closely monitor shipments to prevent the introduction of invasive insects and plant diseases. By planning ahead, Maine shippers can speed up deliveries in this time-sensitive industry,\" said Neil. DACF offers this advice for wreath and tree shippers: - Import regulations can vary from state to state; shippers should check destination state regulations before sending plant material. A summary is available on [DACF's website](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/horticulture/wreaths.shtml). - Carefully inspect plant material before packaging to ensure they are free of insects such as scales, egg masses, or other pest damage. - Clearly label packages containing holiday plant material, beginning with the statement, \"Grown in Maine,\" followed by the county of origin and the name and address of the shipper. - Labels should also indicate the contents of packages, including the different types of greenery, nuts, fruits, and cones used to decorate wreaths. \"Import requirements for cut trees and holiday decorations including greenery, ornamental nuts, and fruit exist to protect regional agriculture and natural resources from the risk of plant pests,\" explained Sarah Scally, Assistant Horticulturist. \"An insect or plant disease that occurs in Maine could potentially be invasive in other states. Unfortunately, despite the quality of Maine products, some shippers have learned about these regulations the hard way and have had shipments delayed, impounded, or destroyed. We want to prevent any losses by getting the word out now.\" Shippers with questions are invited to call: (207) 287-3891 or email [horticulture@maine.gov](mailto:horticulture@maine.gov).

The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) has been awarded a $37,828 USDA Food and Nutrition Service Farm to Food Bank Project Award for work in 2022. This is the second year DACF has received Farm to Food Bank funding, which is part of The Emergency Food Assistance Program. DACF will partner with Healthy Acadia, an Ellsworth-based nonprofit, to prepare family-sized packages of frozen wild blueberries utilizing donated berries from local Washington and Hancock County family farm operations. As part of its Downeast Gleaning Initiative, Healthy Acadia staff will work with farmers to harvest and process berries from fields that would otherwise not be utilized. The resulting packages of frozen wild blueberries will be distributed to more than two dozen pantries in the greater Downeast area in fall 2022. \"It is terrific to see this collaboration between our wild blueberry growers and Healthy Acadia supported with the resources needed to continue for a second year, as it presents an excellent way to get healthy, Maine-grown food to people who need it,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"Healthy Acadia's leadership on this project is commendable and, along with participating wild blueberry producers, they will make a real difference in the lives of Maine people who experience food insecurity in the Downeast region.\" \"The USDA Farmer to Food Bank program is a wonderful opportunity to work with local blueberry growers in our Downeast region to offer a high-quality product to our neighbors who might not otherwise have the chance to access them,\" said Healthy Acadia's Washington County Food Programs Manager Regina Grabrovac. \"This year was our first year working on the project, and food pantries have been very pleased to have the berries. Nutritious fresh and especially frozen local produce is consistently in short supply. We are delighted to have a chance to be involved for a second year now to build on the pilot program established in 2021.\" Farm to Food Bank projects aim to reduce food waste at the agricultural production, processing, or distribution level by donating food, providing food to needy individuals, and building relationships between agricultural producers, processors, distributors, and emergency food organizations. The projects introduce local produce into the [TEFAP program](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/tefap/index.shtml), which normally features mostly shelf-stable staple foods. Mills Administration Announces Conversion of Abandoned Railroad Bed to Multi-use Trail November 30, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Augusta - The Mills Administration announced today that an abandoned Maine Central Railroad Company corridor is being converted to a new multi-use trail. The trail, known as the Madison Branch, spans 32 miles across Kennebec and Somerset Counties and will become a major connector to the Maine Interconnected Trail System (ITS) and Maine ATV Trail System (MATS). The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) closed last week on the Madison Branch purchase from Pan Am Railways at the cost of just over a million dollars. \"Snowmobiles and ATVs are as much a part of the Maine outdoor experience as hiking boots, snowshoes, and skis,\" said Governor Janet Mills. \"My Administration has listened to our off-road recreational vehicle riding community who wants to be able to travel long distances, legally and safely, and have a good time. The addition of the Madison Branch provides that resource and will support local businesses and strengthen the economy throughout the region. I am proud of the work my Administration has done to support conservation and recreational opportunities across Maine.\" \"The Bureau of Parks and Lands team has worked thoroughly to finalize this important acquisition,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"Together with the Land for Maine's Future Program, we are strategically connecting regional trail riding opportunities and other recreational uses that also will serve the larger community.\" The trail passes over the Kennebec River and the Carrabassett River, offering spectacular views. These water crossings are traversed with trestles that will eventually provide safe passage over these rivers for recreational purposes. When construction is complete, the trail will connect thousands of miles of local ATV and snowmobile trails and allow ATV riders and snowmobilers to travel from Oakland to Bingham and beyond, including the Moosehead Lake Region. The route will also be available for non-motorized recreation, including hikers, bikers, and skiers. Local communities and recreation advocates widely supported the purchase of the trail. \"The acquisition of the Madison branch railbed is a major step forward for our region's economy. The interconnectivity between recreational areas will be a positive impact on generations to come,\" said Norridgewock Town Manager Richard Labelle. \"Norridgewock is fortunate to have such strong partners at the State and in our local sportsmen associations that will continue to see this project through to its final stages of development. A cohesive trail system will be good for the health and wealth of Central Mainers as we work to create an expanded trail network for outdoor recreation.\" \"After many years of diligent work by the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands along with numerous interested parties, I am very pleased to see the acquisition of the Madison Branch rail trail,\" said Senator Bradlee Farrin. \"Trail users, students, and educators from Oakland to Jackman will benefit by the increase in miles of trail, and our local economies will be boosted as restaurants, gas stations, and stores will see an increase in business. I am thankful for the opportunity to have been a part of the process that led to the purchase of the trail, and I look forward to the positive impact it will have on central Maine and Somerset County.\" The Land for Maine's Future Program (LMF) was a critical component to the States success in acquiring the Madison Branch rail segment from PanAm, contributing $508,000, nearly half of the funds necessary to complete the acquisition. The Northern Border Regional Commission was pivotal in matching the LMF funding. This project was particularly compelling to the LMF Board due to its location, accessibility to the public, and potential to serve as an economic catalyst to central Maine businesses located along the trail. Governor Mills' most recent budget provides $40 million over four years to replenish the LMF. Prior to this $40 million infusion, the fund was nearly depleted. Now LMF can continue its robust conservation efforts, and the Mills Administration, in collaboration with the LMF Board, has already announced a [call for proposals](//www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/mills-administration-announces-first-call-proposals-2017-land-maines-future-program-2021-10-08) for new projects - the first since 2017. The Madison Branch rail trail will pass through central Maine towns, including Oakland, Fairfield, Norridgewock, Madison, Anson/North Anson, and Embden. Snowmobilers will connect to the ITS through the new route, and ATV riders will connect to MATS 115, the only ATV trail connecting Oxford and Franklin Counties with Somerset, Piscataquis, and Penobscot Counties. Additionally, the trail is close to five schools, with several directly abutting the corridor. Once fully functioning, the rail trail will serve as a recreational resource available for users of all ages and abilities. Public notice and an abutter notification have occurred in conjunction with the purpose. Conversion of the existing rail line into a recreational trail will require additional funding and may take two years. The Bureau of Parks and Lands Off-Road Vehicle Program looks forward to working with local clubs to implement the needed trail work and ongoing maintenance. 2022 Maine Agricultural Trades Show Goes Virtual December 8, 2021 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA - After carefully assessing potential risks to public health amid a sustained surge of COVID-19, the Maine Department of Agriculture Conservation and Forestry (DACF) announced today that the annual Maine Agricultural Trades Show (ATS) will be held online instead of in-person the week of January 10, 2022. \"After listening to concerns raised by our industry's stakeholders, it became clear that transitioning to an online event is the safest option during a surge in COVID-19 for this year's Agricultural Trades Show,\" said Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources Director Nancy McBrady. \"While we are disappointed we will not be gathering in person as planned, we look forward to celebrating our agricultural community and its many contributions to the State of Maine virtually.\" \"Throughout the pandemic, our agricultural community has adapted to provide for the people of Maine.

Happy Tummies: Avoid feeding pets people foods Unfortunately, pets cannot enjoy the same foods that humans do. Fatty foods (like turkey/turkey skin, meat fat, and gravy) can cause pancreatitis - even when consumed in small amounts. Additionally, chocolate, grapes/raisins, onions, and xylitol (an artificial sweetener found in many candies and gum) can be poisonous to pets; and bones can cause injury and illness. Avoid Temptations: Keep holiday decorations out of reach Sparkling ornaments, tinsel, and lights not only make for a beautiful display but also catch the eye of our pets. If eaten, these items could cause intestinal blockages or other injuries. Be sure these items are out of their reach, along with candles, potpourris, and some festive flowers/plant such as mistletoe, holly, and poinsettias. Search No More: Make sure pets have proper identification With all the holiday activities, it can be easy for pets to sneak out and get lost. Make sure that pets have identification tags and microchips that are up to date with current contact information to ensure they can be reunited quickly with their owners. Cleared for Take-off: Ensure your pet is fit for travel If you are traveling with your pets, different states, countries, commercial carriers, and even lodging facilities can all have additional requirements for your pets to accompany you. Talking to your veterinarian can help you determine what steps or documents might be needed to ensure your pet is ready to go. More resources can also be found on the [U.S. Department of Agriculture's Pet Travel website](//www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet-travel). Destress and Decompress: Have a quiet space for your pets Holiday celebrations can be loud and overly stimulating for pets. It is important to have a quiet space set aside to go if they are getting too stressed. Also, have the room stocked with their food, water, litter pan, etc., if they would like to maintain their distance for an extended time. Spread Only Joy: Keep pets away if you are sick Sometimes when we are sick, our pets can get sick too especially with COVID-19. Some dogs and cats have been confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19 in humans. These animals became ill through close contact with their owners, who were infected with COVID-19. Research suggests that pets are unlikely to pass the infection on to uninfected humans. If you or a member of your household suspects or tests positive for COVID-19, protect your pets by avoiding direct contact with them. Or, if you have COVID-19 and must care for a pet, it is recommended to wear a mask and wash your hands before and after interacting with them. More guidance can be found on the Centers for Disease Controls website. If you think your pet is sick, please contact your veterinarian. Following these tips can help your pets stay holly, jolly, and safe this holiday season. If there are any concerns about your pets health now or beyond the holidays, please talk to your veterinarian.

Maine Forest Service Launches Browntail Moth Awareness Month January 27, 2022 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Follow the Four Rs to Knock Out Browntail Moth AUGUSTA - February 2022 has been recognized as Browntail Moth Awareness Month in Maine to encourage people to take advantage of the dormant season of the insect and join together to reduce impacts from browntail moth (BTM). BTM populations in Maine have been in an outbreak phase since 2015 and the pest cannot be eradicated. Most areas of Maine, especially settled areas with significant host tree populations such as oak, apple, crabapple, pear, birch, cherry, or other hardwoods, are at risk of infestation by the caterpillars. While long-lasting tree defoliation and branch dieback are major concerns, BTM's microscopic, toxic hairs can cause trouble breathing and skin irritation similar to poison ivy from a few hours up to several weeks. The Maine Forest Service (MFS) Forest Health and Monitoring Division coordinates within state government, local communities, and directly with citizens to respond to this issue. Winter is the best time to clip and destroy BTM winter webs within reach or hire licensed arborists or pesticide applicators to reduce out-of-reach populations. Comprehensive BTM information and tools compiled by MFS, Board of Pesticides Control, Maine Center for Disease Control, the University of Maine and other partners including research, infestation tracking, FAQs, and educational resources for communities, municipalities, businesses, and healthcare providers, are available on [maine.gov/dacf/knockoutbtm](//maine.gov/dacf/knockoutbtm). Follow the Four Rs to \"Knock Out BTM\" In Our Communities and Reduce the Itch! Recognize: Learn how to tell if the trees where you live, work, and play have BTM. Their [winter webs](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/insects/browntail_moth_id_winter_nests.htm) can look like single leaves hanging onto twigs or fist-sized clumps of leaves tied together tightly with silk. Knowing where the nests are in your yard or town can help inform your management decisions. Learn more by participating in the BTM Awareness Month events included below. Webs can look like fist-sized clumps of leaves tied together tightly with silk, or like single leaves hanging onto twigs. Remove: With permission, [use hand snips or extendable pole pruners to remove webs](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/browntail_moth_info.htm#removing_nests) within reach from the ground and away from hazards such as powerlines. Protect your eyes and skin from hairs that might be present from past caterpillar activity. After removal, destroy webs by burning or soaking in soapy water for several days, then dispose of the nests in the trash. Use hand snips or extendable pole pruners to remove webs within reach from the ground and away from hazards such as powerlines. Recruit: [Hire professional help](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/browntail_moth_info.htm#survey) to treat webs out of reach or near hazards on the property you own or manage. Line up help during winter. [Licensed Professional Arborists](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/arborist/index.shtml) can remove BTM webs in larger trees and shrubs in the winter. In trees where the caterpillars' hairs cause a nuisance and where it is not practical to remove the webs, [Licensed Pesticide Applicators](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/browntail_moth_pesticide_applicator_info.htm) may be able to use insecticides during the growing season to manage BTM. In large, heavily infested trees like these oaks removal of webs may not be practical because of the time and cost involved in this approach. In trees like this that are a concern from the standpoint of human health or nuisance, licensed pesticide applicators may be able to use insecticides to help reduce impacts from browntail moth. Reach Out: If you find BTM in your neighborhood, let your neighbors and town officials know. The more neighbors, businesses, and others get together to respond to the problem, the better the results. Encounters with hairs from BTM caterpillars can cause mild to severe rashes and respiratory issues. Some people say they experience itching with fewer than ten webs per tree or shrub; others say they have no symptoms from heavier infestations around their yards. Vehicles line the road at a community web-clipping event in Deer Isle. Foreground, browntail web in serviceberry. The more that neighbors, businesses and others get together to respond to the problem, the better the results. Everyone is invited to participate in the following BTM Awareness Month events or set up community events. Use #KnockOutBTM on social media to share your efforts. Some ideas for activities include mapping infestations on the town and public properties, hosting public service web-clipping events, creating contests for the most webs clipped or other community, and knowledge building activities.

The AWW has fueled imaginations for centuries. When Henry David Thoreau made his journey to Pillsbury Island on Eagle Lake in the mid-1800s, he was inspired to write about his adventure in The Maine Woods. Since then, many visitors have attempted to capture the Allagash headwater lakes and lower river's beauty and solitude through stories, drawings, photography, and music. The Visiting Artist Program application period runs through February 28, and artists are encouraged to learn more and [apply now](//appengine.egov.com/apps/me/aww-artist-program). Program and Accommodations Overview The AWW Visiting Artist Program invites artists to the remote wilderness of Maine for two weeks of solitude. One chosen artist and a guest will receive complimentary lodging at the AWW Lock Dam Camp for two weeks during August and orientation by AWW Rangers. Lock Dam Camp is a one-room cabin located approximately 10 miles from the boat launch at the southern end of Chamberlain Lake and 60 miles from the nearest town, Millinocket. The camp is on the northern end of Chamberlain Lake, one of the largest and deepest lakes in the North Maine Woods. For 28 summers, it was the home of Dorothy Boone Kidney and her husband Milford - where they provided information to canoeists and tended the dam. Dorothy wrote two books about their life at Lock Dam, Wilderness Journal: Life, Living, Contentment in the Allagash Woods of Maine, and Away from it all. Lock Dam Camp amenities include: - Hand-pumped running water. - A wood stove. - Gas appliances, including a cookstove and refrigerator. - Solar-powered lights. Artists can learn more about the AWW Visiting Artist Program on the BPL web page [maine.gov/allagash](//maine.gov/allagash). Or by contacting Mark Deroche, AWW The AWW, which stretches 92-miles, was established by the Maine State Legislature in 1966 and designated by the U.S. Department of the Interior in 1970 as the first state-administered component of the National Wild and Scenic River System.

Our iconic maple syrup industry supports thousands of jobs, strengthens our economy, and sets us apart nationwide,\" said Governor Mills. \"I am looking forward to tapping our maple tree at the Blaine House and to visiting sugarhouses at farms across the State of Maine on Maple Sunday Weekend.\" \"One of the benefits of maple syrup in Maine is that we have a diverse climate colder in the north and warming up in the south along with mineral enriched soils,\" said Scott Dunn, Maine Maple Producer Association President. \"This leads to unique syrup flavors, depending on the sugarbush you visit.\" Maple syrup producers nationwide grappled with price drops, event cancellations, and restaurant closures during the pandemic. To support Maine's maple syrup producers, Governor Mills dedicated federal coronavirus relief funds to Maines maple producers through her [Agriculture and Food Processing Infrastructure Reimbursement Program](//www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/mills-administration-dedicates-10-million-new-program-assist-maine-food-and-agriculture). Governor Mills also called on the USDA to designate maple syrup as an eligible [Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) specialty crop](//www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/maple-syrup-producers-eligible-covid-19-financial-relief-following-advocacy-maine-delegation). They agreed and made maple sap an eligible commodity for critical economic relief payments. Maine's Maple Sunday Weekend is March 26-27, 2022, at Maine Maple Producers Association sugar shacks around the state. Annually, maple syrup contributes an estimated $49 million in production value, over 800 full- and part-time jobs, and more than $25 million in labor income to Maines economy. Maine is the third-largest producer of maple syrup nationwide. \"Maple syrup season is just around the corner, which is a good reminder that spring is on its way, too,\" said Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"Our maple sugaring families across the state make Maine Maple Sunday Weekend a delicious, fun, and educational event, and I hope everyone makes plans to visit some sugarhouses on March 26 and 27 to partake in the celebration and to support our producers.\" \"Visiting sugar shacks is a Maine rite of passage,\" said [Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources]Director Nancy McBrady. \"Maine Maple Sunday Weekend is a perfect opportunity to support hardworking maple sugaring families and to enjoy this fun maple season celebration.\" Most sugarhouses offer maple syrup samples and demonstrations on how pure Maine maple syrup is made. Many farms offer games, activities, treats, and sugarbush tours. Maine Maple Sunday Weekend Planning Tips: - Each site is different - review schedules and hours of operation, types of complimentary or ticketed activities, samples, tours, shopping, etc. - Dress for the weather and the season- changing temperatures, melting or accumulating spring snow, and mud puddles are common. - Before you depart - check for schedule changes. Use local listings, webpages, social media, or call the business.

The requests are for working farmland and working forest proposals and build on earlier solicitations for conservation, recreation, water access, and working waterfront proposals. The Land for Maine's Future Program is the State of Maine's primary method of conserving land for its natural and recreational value. The program was established in 1987 when Maine citizens approved a bond to fund $35 million for the purchase of lands. Since then, LMF has conserved nearly 604,000 acres of land, more than half of which - 333,425 acres has been working lands. This includes 41 farms and 9,755 acres of farmlands and 26 commercial working waterfront properties, along with 1,272 miles of shorelines of rivers, lakes and ponds, 58 miles of coastline, and 158 miles of former railroad corridors for recreational trails. Prior to the Governor's and Legislature's $40 million infusion through Governor Mills' most recent biennial budget, the Fund was nearly depleted. \"The Land for Maine's Future Program is back in business, and we are once again conserving our working lands and precious natural resources for the benefit of Maine people,\" said Governor Janet Mills. \"I applaud the LMF Board for its aggressive work to protect the cherished lands and waters that form the backbone of our heritage industry - our working farms and forests.\" The Working Farmland Access and Protection Program (WFAPP) provides funding to protect Maine's productive and economically significant agricultural lands. On these protected properties, WFAPP seeks to protect properties that support farming operations in areas of the State that support and anchor a viable agricultural economy, that benefit beginning farmers or underserved communities, and that provide multiple public benefits such as protection of wildlife habitat. The LMF Board also requests applications for projects that protect our working forests. Working forests provide many public benefits, from ensuring a sustainable wood supply to support our forest economy to public access for traditional outdoor recreation pursuits. They provide wildlife habitat and are a critical component of the state's strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by sequestering carbon, as outlined in the State's Climate Action Plan, Maine Won't Wait. Eligible projects could include acquisition of Town forests, drinking water supply protection, properties that protect deer wintering habitat, and working forest easements on commercial timberland. \"The Land for Maine's Future program is a critically important resource for the protection of our state's working farms, forests, and waterfront,\" said Pat Keliher, Land for Maine's Future Board Chair and Commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources. \"These funding opportunities will help safeguard properties so vital to Maine's heritage industries, natural resources, and unspoiled wilderness.\" \"Through these LMF programs, Maine is poised to protect more of our valuable working farmland and forests from development,\" said Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"We thank Governor Mills and the Maine Legislature for their bold vision to allocate resources to conserve lands that feed us, help our state to mitigate climate change, and routinely provide numerous other public benefits to the people of Maine.\" \"The DACF is excited that the WFAPP will provide protection to working farmland properties whose continued ability to actively farm is essential to the long-term future of Maine's agricultural sector,\" said Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources Director Nancy McBrady. \"Our working forests are critical to our economy and the Maine way of life, and the intertwined concerns of climate change. I applaud the efforts of all who make this program a success,\" said Patty Cormier, Maine Forest Service Director. \"In the face of climate change, an increased need for housing, and innovations in the building industry, maintaining a sustainable timber supply is critically important to growing Maine's forest economy. Investing in working forest protection guarantees valuable carbon sequestration, tax revenue, and recreational resources in addition to permanent public access,\" said Manager and Co-Owner of Robbins Lumber and LMF Board member Catherine Robbins Halsted. Proposals can come from state agencies, land trusts, municipalities, cooperating entities as defined by Title 5 M.R.S.A Section 6201 (2)or other entities identified as an eligible holder of conservation easements under Title 33 M.R.S.A, Section 476(2). Farmland proposals must be sponsored by the Bureau of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Resources. A copy of the WFAPP workbook, which includes all information necessary to apply for LMF funds, is available on the [LMF web page](//www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf/funds/wfapp.shtml). Prospective WFAPP applicants can contact Alex Redfield, Farmland Protection Specialist, Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources, at (207) 592-0640 with questions. Working forest proposals must be sponsored by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry or the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. Application materials can be found on the [LMF web page](//www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf/funds/conservation-recreation.shtml). In January 2022, Governor Mills announced five Land for Maines Future conservation projects of statewide significance that protect working lands and wildlife habitat and that preserve public access to lakes, rivers, scenic views, and mountain vistas. The projects, which are located across the state, were the first to be selected by the Land for Maine's Future Board since Governor Mills and the Legislature reinvigorated the program. About Land's for Maine's Future The LMF Program is the State of Maine's primary funding vehicle for conserving land for its natural and recreational value. The program was established in 1987 when Maine citizens approved a bond to fund $35 million to purchase lands. The program's priority is to conserve the Maine landscape, recognizing that working lands and public access to these lands is critical to preserving Maine's quality of life. Since then, LMF has conserved nearly 613,000 acres of land, more than half of which 333,425 acres has been working lands. The conservation includes 41 farms and 9,755 acres of farmlands, and 26 commercial working waterfront properties, along with 1,272 miles of shorelines of rivers, lakes, and ponds, 58 miles of coastline, and 158 miles of former railroad corridors for recreational trails. LMF project awards include the conservation of working forests, farms, and commercial waterfronts, public access to our woods and waters, and the protection and management of wildlife. Full details about the types of projects supported, who is eligible to apply, the application process, and proposal evaluation are available now on the [LMF webpage](//www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf/).

Signs and symptoms of bird flu infections in people can include fever (temperature of 100F or greater) or feeling feverish, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, fatigue, headaches, eye redness (or conjunctivitis), and difficulty breathing. Other possible symptoms are diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. As with seasonal flu, some people are at high risk of getting very sick from bird flu infections, including pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems, and people 65 and older. The U.S. CDC provides information on [avian flu transmission at this link](//www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/avianflu/avian-flu-transmission.pdf). The Maine CDC's Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory is prepared to process samples and quickly provide results for anyone potentially exposed to the virus. Governor Mills Proclaims this Week Agriculture Week in Maine March 23, 2022 In recognition of the agricultural community and its significant contributions to the State of Maine, Governor Janet Mills has proclaimed [March 20, 2022-March 26, 2022 Agriculture Week (PDF)](//www.maine.gov/governor/mills/sites/maine.gov.governor.mills/files/inline-files/Agriculture%20Week%202022.pdf). \"As the granddaughter of Ashland potato farmers, I grew up watching the hard work of food producers in Maine. Our farmers do the backbreaking work that it takes to grow the food we need to feed our families every day. We should all be grateful to our agricultural community, not just this week, but every week of the year,\" said Governor Mill. \"In recognition of the agricultural community's contributions to the state of Maine, which include supplying us with locally-grown food, supporting thousands of jobs, sustaining our working lands, and strengthening our reputation for world-class produce and products, I proclaim this week agriculture week in Maine. My Administration will continue to do all we can to support Maines hardworking farmers and food producers who are at the foundation of our state. The text of the Governors proclamation is below. WHEREAS, Maines farmers are a cornerstone of our great state and provide numerous benefits to Maines residents and visitors, we all must continue to support our agricultural producers to ensure Maines working landscapes thrive, agriculture remains a foundation of our state, and Maine-grown farm products are accessible and available for generations to come; and WHEREAS, Maines agriculture sector fuels our economy, contributing more than $3.6 billion in economic impact, employing over 27,000 people, and supporting approximately 1.3 million acres of farmland; and WHEREAS, Maines agricultural community has worked tirelessly to build the foundation for a vibrant local food system which ensures the availability of Maine farm products year-round; and WHEREAS, farmers uphold one of the states key heritage industries by stewarding land resources, sustaining a legacy of farm trades, and ensuring an abundant supply of food and other agricultural products; and WHEREAS, Maine has set goals to strengthen our states agricultural infrastructure and increase the amount of food produced and processed in-state, to end hunger, decrease reliance on food imports, and increase Maine peoples consumption of locally and regionally produced food; NOW, THEREFORE, be it resolved that I, Janet T.

In testimony whereof, I have caused the Great Seal of the State to be hereunto affixed GIVEN under my hand at Augusta this twenty-third day of March Two Thousand Twenty Two. Janet T. Mills Governor Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Situational Report - March 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Maine Animal Health Officials Respond to Avian Influenza Current Situation - Since DACF's March 17 update, USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in samples taken from small flocks of non-commercial backyard birds (non-poultry); Lincoln County (March 17); Knox and York Counties (March 19); Cumberland County (March 22); and Washington County (March 26). - DACF Animal Health placed the properties under quarantine, and humane depopulation efforts have been completed. - Additional safety measures were implemented, including monitoring properties with domestic flocks within a 10 km radius and notifying bird owners of the importance of proactive safety measures to help prevent disease. - The risk for HPAI remains high, and backyard flock and commercial operators are advised to keep birds indoors to prevent the spread of this disease. - All confirmed HPAI cases will be listed on the regularly updated [USDA APHIS website](//www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022). Other recent HPAI confirmations in Maine: Confirmed cases of the H5N1 strain of HPAI were detected in non-commercial backyard birds (non-poultry) on Saturday, February 19, and on Wednesday, February 23. Both cases were confirmed in Knox County, Maine. All confirmed cases will be listed on the [APHIS website](//www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022). HPAI Common Questions HPAI Common Questions Q: HPAI spread? A: The current outbreak of HPAI is spreading across the country primarily due to the migration of wild birds. There is little evidence to suggest HPAI is being spread from farm to farm (lateral transmission). The virus is very prevalent in the environment in wild birds so flock owners need to practice strong biosecurity. More information on steps they can take to enhance biosecurity is available here: [healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov](//www.healthybirds.aphis.usda.gov). Q: How long do we have to keep our birds inside? A: As long as the disease transmission risk is high. Please reference the Maine DACF Animal Health [website](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ahw/animal_health/index.shtml) for up-to-date information. Q: What do we know about the coming months? A: Because HPAI is being spread by migrating wild birds, it is difficult to predict what will happen over the next couple months. The trends observed with past North American HPAI outbreaks are that we often see a reprieve in the summer months. Summer is when the virus present on the landscape (outdoors) is degraded by sunlight and heat. Migratory waterfowl (ducks, geese, and shorebirds) moving south in the fall months are likely to shed AI virus again. It is critically important that poultry owners work now to provide indoor shelter for their birds through the fall and provide outdoor access only in covered poultry runs, allowing protection from predators and preventing contact with wild waterfowl and their droppings. Q: Is it safe to purchase new birds for my flock this year? A: It's always recommended to only purchase birds from a reputable source that follows effective biosecurity protocols and closely monitors poultry health. NPIP Certified hatcheries monitor their breeder flocks for important chronic diseases, and are a recommended source for new poultry. In light of the nation-wide outbreak of Avian Influenza, it is more important than ever to follow cleaning and sanitation steps and only purchase birds with known health histories. You can find more detailed guidance from the USDA Defend the Flock [Checklist for Adding or Replacing Poultry.](//www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/fsc-birds-checklist-replacement-poultry.pdf) Q: What are the signs of HPAI in birds? A: Sudden death without clinical signs; Lack of energy and appetite; Decreased egg production or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; Swelling of the head, comb, eyelid, Purple discoloration of Incoordination; or Diarrhea. [Learn more](//www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/outbreak-illness/outbreak-illness). Q: How do I protect my flock from HPAI? A: The best approach is to [practice good biosecurity](//www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/defend-the-flock-program/!ut/p/z1/lZLNcoIwFIWfxQVLzE1Qwe6AMoBF26pUmk0HFQMtECamOuPTN9pu-qPSbDJJvnPP3HuCKEoQrdNdwVJZ8Dot1fmZDl5CQlyMezjyR0MLHl0D-tMH35hhEy1OQHTfc7EzA7V7Dtje1Bx7XkgAG4j-T_8UDJR-Hs8nFnbCIWmnhzPLhnb6CwC9XH50zUBNkIixO2aINqnM9aLecJSss01Wr3WZZ_qm5Ks3vRGcibS68LJA9OQ1wa4P1tHLu8VgB8PwLjAHAD75As6FMb0GHNP6AfyOo8VAWMmXn3_HrpeGpToXqimRie67UNe5lM32RgMN9vt9l3HOyqy74pUGf0lyvpUo-U6iporjODlEARTha7_cRXan8wGokCNS/?1dmy&urile=wcm%3apath%3a%2Faphis_content_library%2Fsa_our_focus%2Fsa_animal_health%2Fsa_animal_disease_information%2Favian%2Fdefend-the-flock-program%2Fdtf-biosecurity%2Fbiosecurity101) - this means keeping your birds separate from sources of disease, such as infected wild birds and their environment. Q: What should I do if I have sick birds or large mortality in my flock? A: Report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through your [state veterinarian](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ahw/animal_health/index.shtml) or through people contract AI? A: No cases of this particular strain of the avian influenza virus have been detected in humans in the United States. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recent detections of this strain of influenza in birds in Maine and several other states [present a low risk to the public](//www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2021-2022/bird-flu-poses-low-risk-public.htm). Q: Does HPAI present a food safety risk? A: No, poultry and eggs are safe to eat when handled and cooked properly. Eggs from a known infected flock are safely disposed of. Q: Is compensation offered to impacted flock owners? A: Yes. Refer to the USDA APHIS [website (PDF)](//www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/2016/hpai-indemnity.pdf) to learn what is covered and how the process works. Additional Resources According to the USDA, all bird owners, whether commercial producers or backyard enthusiasts, should: - Practice protective security measures to help prevent disease - Prevent contact between their birds and wild birds, and - Report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through your [state veterinarian](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ahw/animal_health/index.shtml)or through USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593.

Maine averages over 550 wildfires annually, over ninety percent of which are caused by people. Preventing wildfires protects our economy and our environment, safeguards property and the safety of Maine people, and preserves our healthy, productive forests. Everyone can do their part to prevent wildfires in the State of Maine,\" said Governor Mills. \"I ask all Maine people to take this week as an opportunity to learn about the ways you can protect your home and your property from wildfires.\" \"Eighty-nine percent of Maine is forested, and this precious natural resource is ours to protect,\" said Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"Wildfire Awareness Week is an important reminder that most wildfires in Maine are caused by people and are therefore preventable. I invite everyone to increase their awareness of the ways we can all work to prevent wildfires.\" \"Maine has experienced over 90 wildfires already in 2022, and warm, dry weather increases the potential for significant wildfire activity,\" said Maine State Forester and Director of the Maine Forest Service Patty Cormier. \"We each have a role to play in preventing fires, and Wildfire Awareness Week is the ideal time to get ready and become mindful about wildfire prevention.\" \"Maine's firefighters and first responders do more than fight wildfires they protect lives, homes, and businesses,\" said Chief Forest Ranger Robby Gross. \"There may be no better reason to help prevent wildfires than knowing fewer fires mean fewer risks for our firefighters and first responders to face.\" To learn how to protect your life, home, and community, visit [www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_protection/firewise/index.html](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_protection/firewise/index.html).

Advisory: The risk for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) remains high, and bird owners are advised to keep birds indoors to prevent the spread of this disease. The trends observed with past North American HPAI outbreaks are that we often see a reprieve in the summer months. This is because summer is when the virus present on the landscape (outdoors) is degraded by sunlight and heat. Animal Health Officials from the six New England States recommend that all competitions, exhibitions, shows, swaps, or other in-person events encouraging the gathering or comingling of domestic fowl or poultry be postponed until July 1, 2022 or later. \"The best way to prevent spread of HPAI from infected poultry to healthy poultry is to avoid unnecessary mixing of groups of domestic birds,\" said Maine State Veterinarian Dr. Michele Walsh. \"With the risk of HPAI considered high in Maine, we are confident that a smart tactic to control the spread of HPAI is to recommend cancelling or postponing poultry events through July 1, 2022 and re-evaluating the HPAI threat to domestic poultry and pet birds at that time.\" For a complete snapshot of HPAI in Maine, the state's response, a list of frequently asked questions, and additional HPAI resources, visit [maine.gov/dacf/hpai](//maine.gov/dacf/hpai) To report sick poultry or unusual domestic bird deaths, call the USDA's toll-free sick bird hotline at 1-866-536-7593.

Mills Administration Announces the Permanent Protection of Land for Outdoor Recreation April 29, 2022 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Augusta - The Mills Administration announced today that 813 acres of highland wild blueberry fields, wildlife habitat, and recreational lands in the towns of Vienna and New Sharon have been permanently protected for outdoor recreation. The newly acquired lands represent the largest inholding within the Kennebec Highlands Public Land. The acquisition builds on the more than 20 years the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's (DACF) Bureau of Parks and Lands (BPL) has worked with 7 Lakes Alliance (formerly Belgrade Region Conservation Alliance) to conserve 6,800 acres across this significant landscape. The newly acquired lands include forests, open wetlands, streams, and Vienna Mountain summit - which provides a 360-degree view of the Highlands region and beyond. Since the inception of the BPL and 7 Lakes Alliance partnership, the acquisition of the Vienna Mountain lands has been a top priority. Situated in the middle of Kennebec County and within 15 miles of Augusta, Waterville, Skowhegan, and Farmington, visitors to the Kennebec Highlands are drawn to miles of hiking, biking, snowmobile, ATV trails, and secluded woods and ponds for hunting and fishing. \"We are pleased to have the opportunity to conserve lands with such value to the public,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"From more than 200 acres of productive wild blueberry barrens to important wildlife habitat and access for numerous types of recreational activities, there is something for everyone here.\" \"With remote ponds and miles of trails, the Kennebec Highlands is one of central Maine's best-kept secrets,\" said BPL Director Andy Cutko. \"Now, with the addition of a scenic hilltop and hundreds of acres of beautiful fields and forests, the Highlands is an even bigger public asset to the region.\" \"Conservation of these lands protects the very heart of the Kennebec Highlands, envisioned and supported by community partners for a quarter-century,\" said Laura Rose Day, President and CEO of 7 Lakes Alliance. \"We are grateful and excited to work with many partners to realize the benefits of this significant investment in these lands and waters for all.\" The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and the Land for Maine's Future Program (LMF) were essential to the state's ability to acquire Kennebec Highlands Public Reserve. \"The Program has a 20-year history of supporting acquisitions in the Kennebec Highlands; this acquisition marks our fourth investment in the area,\" said LMF Director Sarah Demers. \"Since 1987, over 610,000 acres of Maine land has been preserved in all sixteen counties with significant financial assistance from the people of Maine through the LMF. \"With this most recent acquisition, the LWCF has helped to acquire five parcels in the Kennebec Highlands, the first in 1976,\" said Douglas Beck, Director of the Grants and Community Recreation Program. \"For over fifty-seven years, LWCF has helped local communities and state agencies acquire and develop over 680 parks and outdoor recreation areas for the benefit of the people of Maine and our guests from away.\" The Kennebec Highlands project partners enthusiastically support the LWCF and the LMF. Learn more about LWCF at [maine.gov/dacf/parks/grants/landwaterconservation_fund.html](//www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/grants/land_water_conservation_fund.html), and the LMF at [maine.gov/dacf/lmf/](//www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf/). In the coming months, BPL will develop a plan for how best to manage these critical new lands, including creating new trails and connecting the existing trail system through the new parcels, managing the blueberry fields and coordinating public picking, and developing new access points for public recreation and resource management. Poor road conditions presently limit vehicular access to the new Vienna Mountain lands. Work to begin road and parking improvements is slated for Summer 2022.

Stop Browntail Moth Hitchhikers May 2022 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Augusta - The Maine Forest Service asks everyone to check cars, trucks, boats, bikes, ATVs, and other vehicles for wandering browntail moth (BTM) caterpillars. Now through late June, BTM caterpillars become expert hitchhikers. When they catch a ride, BTM may set up house in a new area and cause irritation to people and destroy foliage on trees and shrubs at their new location. If a BTM caterpillar is discovered before leaving an already infested area, it may be left on-site or destroyed. If found after leaving the infested area, the caterpillar should be eliminated. The best method to kill a BTM caterpillar is to move them to a plastic bag or another container, freeze them or soak them in a bucket of soapy water before disposing of them in the trash. Reduce the chances of picking up browntail by avoiding parking and storing materials and equipment near infested trees. About Browntail Moth (BTM) BTM is an insect of forest and human health concern accidentally introduced into Somerville, MA, from Europe in 1897. By 1913, the insect spread to all New England states and New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. Since then, populations of this pest slowly decreased due to natural controls until the 1960s, when the BTM was limited to Cape Cod and a few islands off the Maine coast in Casco Bay. Maine is experiencing a BTM outbreak. The caterpillars are found in patches along the Maine coast and more than 60 miles inland from the western Maine border to the New Brunswick border, with the greatest concentrations in mid-coastal Maine and the capital region. Learn more about BTM, be aware, and skip the itch!

We move tree-killing pests and diseases to new places in and on untreated firewood. Leaving the firewood at home on your next trip helps protect our trees and forests. Trees cover nearly 90% of Maine's land. In Maine, trees: - Support one out of every 25 jobs through the forest products sector alone, - Provide food and shelter for our birds, bears, bees, deer, and other wildlife, - Stabilize the soils and protect water quality, - Absorb carbon dioxide and give back oxygen, and more. Trees are under threat every day from invasive forest insects and diseases. They are vulnerable to new introductions of these pests, which are easily spread when firewood is moved. What's in your firewood? Maybe the next threat to Maine's pristine lakeshores and excellent trout habitat, Maine's tourism, recreation, and forest economies, Maine's scenic mountains and shores, Maine's way of life, and the way life should be. Many of us mistakenly think that firewood is dead. In truth, firewood harbors live insects and pathogens for many years after the tree has been cut into firewood. These insects and diseases can spread to living trees, causing them to die. Firewood movement contributed to the rapid spread of the [emerald ash borer](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/index.shtml), a devastating invasive insect that has killed billions of ash trees in North America and thousands in Maine. Many other invasive pests can also hide on or in firewood. Here are a few examples of what you could carry with you when you move firewood: [Oak wilt fungus](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/index.htm#OWD)that threatens our oak trees; - The colorful planthopper and expert hitchhiker, the [spotted lanternfly](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/slf/index.shtml)that threatens not only trees but also important crops and certain adult beverages (e.g., wine); - The devastating [Asian longhorned beetle](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/ALB/index.shtml)that can kill many of our hardwood trees, including the sugar maple, - And the rash-causing, tree-defoliator, [browntail moth](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/browntail_moth_info.htm). These invasive pests are just a few of many forest health threats that we know can move with firewood. Tiny insect eggs or microscopic fungi may be lurking on or under the bark, waiting to be carried to a new location. Even seemingly pest-free firewood can harbor hidden hitchhikers. We can help slow their spread by choosing to use local or certified-heat treated firewood. Maine has a [ban](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/firewood_out_of_state_ban_order.html) on untreated, out-of-state firewood and [guidelines](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/firewood.shtml) for how far we should move firewood within the state. If you have questions, check out the [Don't Move Firewood FAQ](https://www.dontmovefirewood.org/how-to-help/f-a-q/). Firewood tips for your next outdoor recreation trip - Leave firewood at home. - Buy firewood as close to your destination as possible. - Purchasing certified firewood is the best choice. Buy firewood with a state seal stating the wood has been heat-treated to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 75 minutes to make sure it is pest free. - If certified firewood is not available, purchase your firewood as close as possible to where you will burn it. - At some sites, you may be able to gather firewood on or near the site. Check local rules. - If you buy wood that is not heat-treated or gather firewood and don't burn it all, don't take it home with you or to your next destination. What is local? Generally, when it comes to firewood, 50 miles is too far, and 10 miles or less is best. Where can I find heat-treated or local firewood? Maine and several other states use [Firewood Scout](https://firewoodscout.org/resources/ME) to help travelers find sources of firewood near their destination. Also, many people sell campfire wood along Maine's roadways, especially close to campgrounds and parks. What if I already moved untreated firewood? - Burn it. Do so [safely](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_protection/programs_services.html#Campfire_Permits), quickly, and completely. Be sure to also burn any small pieces of bark and debris that have fallen from the wood. - If you cant burn it all within 24 hours reach out to the [Maine Forest Service](http://www.maine.gov/firewood)for safe disposal options. What else should I know about moving firewood in Maine? - Maine has a [ban on untreated out-of-state firewood](http://www.maine.gov/firewood). [Quarantines](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/quarantine_information.html)in and outside of Maine, such as those related to emerald ash borer and European larch canker, also impact the legal firewood movement. - Some destinations have additional limitations; for instance, [bringing firewood to Baxter State Park is prohibited](https://baxterstatepark.org/camp-summer/#prepare). - Learn more at [maine.gov/firewood](http://www.maine.gov/firewood)and [www.dontmovefirewood.org](http://www.dontmovefirewood.org/\"). Governor Mills Declares June Maine Dairy Month June 1, 2022 For more information contact: Scott Ogden at: [scott.ogden@maine.gov](mailto:scott.ogden@maine.gov) Governor calls on Maine people to support dairy farmers and creameries by purchasing Maine dairy products #ChooseMaineDairy Augusta, MAINE - During a celebration at the Blaine House with farmers and producers with the Maine Dairy Industry Association, the Maine Dairy & Nutrition Council, and the Maine Cheese Guild, Governor Janet Mills today signed a proclamation declaring June Maine Dairy Month. \"Dairy farms are a cornerstone of Maine's agricultural industry, of our rural communities, and of our economy as a whole,\" said Governor Mills. \"From milk to cheese to yogurt to ice cream, Maines dairy farmers work hard to deliver us delicious, world-class products that I am proud to celebrate and promote. I encourage Maine people to join me in appreciating Maine's dairy farms and our incredible dairy products as we celebrate Dairy Month in Maine. Doing so will not only taste good, but it will help our dairy farmers and our economy.\" Maine is home to 176 dairy farms that care for herds of dairy cows, goats, and sheep and steward 700,000 acres of fields, pastures, and croplands. Because of their work, the state boasts award winning cheeses, yogurt, ice cream, and butter made exclusively with Maine milk and cream. Maine is among states where micro-creameries can heat-treat fresh and fermented dairy products, such as yogurt and cheeses, and sell to shoppers under a state dairy licensing program, which has helped establish nearly 80 micro-dairies. Maine dairy farmers and creameries provide 4,733 direct and 10,201 indirect jobs and generate $904 million in direct economic impact and $1 billion in indirect economic impact. \"We couldn't be more proud to celebrate our Maine dairy producers and processors during Dairy Month. Mainers can connect with dairy farms, cheese makers, and more on RealMaine.com and see for themselves how delicious these products are while directly supporting the farm families and businesses in Maine's dairy industry,\" said Nancy McBrady, Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources Director. \"Our working family dairy farms maintain open spaces that help make Maine picture-worthy, so when you raise a glass of Maine milk, or grab a dairy snack like Canty Cow frozen custard you're doing your part to maintain that amazing quality of place we all enjoy,\" said Betsy Bullard, Brigeen Farm and Canty Cow Creamery in Turner. \"Maine is unique in so many ways, especially in the support we have for agriculture, both conventional and organic, and the products grown and made here. The Governor's proclamation of June as Dairy Month is yet another example of this support. I feel fortunate to live and farm in a state that understands how far reaching our farm work is. Our dairies are truly the backbone of our rural communities. As we enjoy our ice cream this summer, I hope we call can think about the dairy farm family connected to our favorite products, and the care and effort that is exerted every day to feed our communities,\" said Annie Watson, Sheepscot Valley Farm in Whitefield, and Maine Organic Milk Producers president. \"Pineland Farms Dairy is excited to be celebrating Dairy Month. We strive to produce the highest quality cheese available using 100 percent fresh Maine milk. By purchasing locally produced cheese, you are supporting your local farms, your local economy, and a regional food system that is better for you and the environment,\" said Jim Lesser, Pineland Farms Dairy director of sales and marketing in New Gloucester. \"Maine dairy farms are the foundation for successful Maine creameries. Our cheesemakers are diverse and found throughout the state. The products from Maine dairy farms and creameries are found in restaurants, farmers markets and stores. You can meet cheesemakers and discover their award-winning cheeses at Open Farm Day in July, the Annual Maine Cheese Festival in September, and Open Creamery Day in October,\" said Heather Donahue, Balfour Farm in Pittsfield. \"Dairy Month is an excellent time to recognize the contributions that dairy farms make to the state of Maine, not only the production of nutritious and delicious local foods, but millions of dollars into the Maine economy, thousands of jobs, the stewardship of thousands of acres of farmland and small woodlands, and advances in soil health and sustainable agricultural practices,\" said Jami Badershall, Maine Dairy Promotion Board communications manager. \"As a Maine dairy farmer I am so grateful our neighbors trust us to put good food from our family farm on their family table. Our way of life wouldn't be possible and it couldn't be the way we make our living if we weren't surrounded and supported by our Maine community. We are so proud to be a part of the engine that drives our local and state economies, stewards the lands and waterways, cares for our communities, and is focused on being not just part of Maines sustainable future, but part of the solutions. Maine dairy isn't about yesterday, its about doing better today so that tomorrow is brighter for all. Our family is proud, along with 1/3 of Maine's dairy farm families, to be farmer owners of Cabot Creamery Cooperative, and be the change through our mission to sustainability, our B Corp commitment, and farmer gratitude to everyone that makes the world go around for good. Were so proud when folks choose Maine milk and dairy and no matter what month it is, we're already making more so its always in season,\" said Jenni Tilton-Flood, Flood Brothers Farm, Clinton. \"In celebration of Dairy Month this June, the Maine Cheese Guild is proud to highlight the award-winning cheese being produced from over 80+ commercial creameries. Cheese being made from the highest-quality milk, from animals nourished on Maine's lush rolling pastures, and cared for by 99% family-owned and operated dairy farms. To produce high-quality cheese, you must start with high-quality milk, and it doesn't get better than Maine dairy,\" said Holly Aker, Maine Cheese Guild president. \"We are pleased to be part of the celebration for Dairy Month and appreciate the recognition of how important our dairies are to the state of Maine. Maine dairy farmers are independent, and innovative, and it is reflected in the tapestry of how our farms are run and market themselves. They range the gamut from small operations of less than 10 cows, to those with hundreds of milking head. There is a strong influence of farm-to-table, on-farm processing, artisanal, and organic movements in our state. Maine sensibilities have led the way in humane treatment of animals and conservation-minded on-farm practices. One common thread that is woven through all Maine farms is that they are run by families. From the smallest to the largest these are operations that support families,\" said Tade Sullivan, Maine Dairy Industry Association Executive Director. Supporting documents Governor Mills Announces 20 New Land for Maine's Future Conservation Projects June 6, 2022 Governor Janet Mills today announced 20 new Land for Maine's Future (LMF) conservation projects across Maine that conserve lands and preserve public access to lakes, rivers, scenic views, and mountain vistas for Maine people. With the selection of these projects, the Land for Maines Future Board has now approved a total of 25 new projects in the last year since Governor Mills and the Legislature [reinvigorated the program](https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/promise-kept-governor-mills-signs-strong-bipartisan-budget-achieving-55-percent-education) with $40 million in new State funding through the biennial budget. Additional projects focused on conserving working lands are expected to receive funding later this year. Of the 20 projects announced today, one-third of the applications came from municipalities - including Fryeburg, North Berwick, Owls Head, Portland, Searsmont, and Windham for the conservation of recreation areas. Four projects in Ellsworth, Fryeburg, Machiasport, and Oxford are located adjacent to or near public schools, delivering opportunities for nature-based learning and outdoor recreation. These LMF projects are expected to leverage more than $8 million in matching Federal funds. \"Maine people value the outdoors, and each of these projects represents an exceptional opportunity for us to get outdoors and to protect public access for the enjoyment of generations to come,\" said Governor Janet Mills. I am proud that the State of Maine, thanks to my Administration and the Legislature, is once again partnering with towns across Maine to preserve our cherished lands and waters for Maine people.

The Land for Maine's Future Program is the State of Maine's primary method of conserving land for its natural and recreational value. The program was established in 1987 when Maine citizens approved a bond to fund $35 million to purchase land and easements. The programs priority is to conserve Maine landscape, recognizing that working lands and public access to these lands is critical to preserving Maine's quality of life. Since then, LMF has conserved nearly 604,000 acres of land, more than half of which 333,425 acres has have been working lands. This work includes 41 farms and 9,755 acres of farmlands and 26 commercial working waterfront properties, 1,272 miles of shorelines of rivers, lakes, and ponds, 58 miles of coastline, and 158 miles of former railroad corridors for recreational trails. The fund was nearly depleted before the Governors and Legislatures $40 million infusion. Now that it is replenished, LMF can continue its robust conservation efforts.

Governor Mills Launches $50 Million Jobs & Recovery Plan Initiative to Rebuild Maine State Parks June 8, 2022 For more information contact: Scott Ogden at: [scott.ogden@maine.gov](mailto:scott.ogden@maine.gov) Plan to upgrade parks across Maine represents first meaningful investment in park infrastructure in 15 years; comes at a time of record visitation and aims to improve experience for Maine people and visitors CAMDEN HILLS STATE PARK - Governor Janet Mills today announced the launch of a $50 million initiative through her Maine Jobs & Recovery Plan to rebuild infrastructure at State Parks across Maine to make them more enjoyable and accessible for Maine people and visitors. The Governor's significant investment in Maine State Parks comes as a time when they have experienced a record number of visitors. In 2021, Maines 48 parks and historic sites which are operated and maintained by the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) welcomed more than 3.3 million visitors, who are estimated to have generated more than $100 million in revenue for Maines economy. Despite the popularity of the parks, it has been more than fifteen years since they have seen any meaningful investment, which has forced DACF to defer much-needed maintenance on roads, trail systems, and other vital infrastructure that make the parks accessible and enjoyable for Maine people and visitors. With funding from the Governor's Jobs Plan, DACF will undertake urgent capital infrastructure improvements to help address major safety and stewardship concerns, enable the parks to accommodate continued growth in visitation, and bolster the recovery of Maine's vital tourism and outdoor recreation sectors. \"Our State Parks are treasures that belong in perpetuity to the people of Maine for the enjoyment and benefit of the people of Maine,\" said Governor Janet Mills. With this funding, we will undertake the important and long-neglected work of rebuilding our parks as part of our effort to improve the experience they offer and to secure their place as vital economic engines in communities across Maine. The Governor made the announcement at Camden Hills State Park in Camden. Renowned for its panoramic view of Camden Harbor and Penobscot Bay, Camden Hills State Park provides year-round access to outdoor activities, outstanding hiking trails, and camping. DACF plans to use the funding to pave the summit road to Mount Battie, improve drainage, replace or renovate trails to improve ADA access, and expand electric hook-ups and water access in the campground. The Governor was joined by DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal, Bureau of Parks and Lands Director Andy Cutko, Maine Outdoor Brands Executive Director Jenny Kordick, Penobscot Bay Regional Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Thomas Peaco, Maine Coast Heritage Trust Senior Public Policy Manager Jeff Romano, Appalachian Mountain Club Maine Conservation Policy Director Eliza Townsend, and Maine Conservation Voters Director of Policy and Partnerships Kathleen Meil. \"Governor Mills' Maine Jobs & Recovery Plan makes a historic and much needed investment in Maines State Parks,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"With this funding, we will be better equipped to steward these treasured resources and improve accessibility, while supporting jobs in communities throughout Maine and other economic opportunities that our State Parks provide.\" \"It has been nearly 15 years since the last meaningful investment in Maines State Parks,\" said Andy Cutko, Director of DACF's Bureau of Parks and Lands. \"We're thrilled that Governor Mills and the Legislature recognized the immeasurable benefits of State Parks for Maines environment, our economy, and our public health.\" \"Maine's outdoor industry applauds this significant and much needed investment in our State Parks,\" said Jenny Kordick, Executive Director of Maine Outdoor Brands. \"This funding will support trails, campsites, and other infrastructure, further improving a system of parks that already attracts millions of people each year. State Parks serve as part of the foundation for Maines $3 billion outdoor economy, helping to make our state an attractive place to live and work while also generating visitor spending that helps create jobs across the state.\" \"State Parks add significantly to our quality of life for Knox County residents, as well as supporting our local economy by attracting tens of thousands of visitors to our region each year,\" said Penobscot Bay Regional Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Thomas Peaco. \"We applaud this important investment in capital improvements for our State Parks.\" The funding through the Jobs Plan is expected to benefit parks across the state. Infrastructure investments will include: - enhancements to the visitor experience, such as repairing restrooms and shower facilities, expanding Wi-Fi, and renovating visitor centers and overnight shelters. - structural upgrades and deferred maintenance, such as addressing structural deficiencies in bridges and roads, redesigning park entrance stations, making ADA-required accommodations, and modernizing equipment at park headquarters. - public safety and environmental management improvements, such as upgrading boat launches, refurbishing playgrounds to meet safety standards, restoring masonry on historic sites, upgrading septic systems, and mitigating erosion on recreational trails. The investment in State Parks builds on Governor Mills' strong conservation record. The Governor and the Legislature reinvigorated the Land for Maine's Future Program with a $40 million investment through the most recent biennial budget. That funding has allowed the for Maines Future Board to [approve a total of 25 new projects](https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-mills-announces-20-new-land-maines-future-conservation-projects-2022-06-06) in the last year with additional projects focused on conserving working lands expected later this year. Later today, Governor Mills will visit Rockland Recovery Center and then she will personally present Jon Powers of North East Mobile Health Services in Rockport with the Governor's Award. The award is conferred for exceptional contribution to the EMS system at the state, national, or system-wide level to a candidate who has demonstrated involvement and contributions in multiple areas of EMS activity, such as system development, education, administration, public education, or quality/process improvement.

Supporting documents Emerald Ash Borer Detections in Oakland and Waterville Provide Timely Reminder: Leave your Firewood at Home June 30, 2022 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Department reminds everyone to use local or heat treated firewood and announces Emergency Order expansion to slow the spread of emerald ash borer. AUGUSTA - The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's (DACF) Maine Forest Service (MFS) has expanded an [Emergency Order to restrict the movement of ash from areas likely to harbor emerald ash borer (](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab-emergencyorder.shtml) [EAB](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/index.shtml)). This order is in response to detections in Oakland, Waterville and Lewiston this month and earlier finds in Lovell and Gray and is in addition to the [state quarantine rule](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/index.shtml) on EAB. The order and the quarantine exist to help slow the spread of EAB within Maine. EAB is a shiny green beetle killing ash trees in Maine and many other parts of North America. In the case of the Kennebec County detection, a chance sighting of bright spots on ash bark at highway speed on I-95 led to follow-up surveys on the ground confirming the beetles presence. In Lewiston, a crew examining declining ash viewed from the highway found emerald ash borer galleries in nearby trees. Although the detections are new, in at least one of the sites, the infestation has been developing for several years. \"These detections are a good reminder to [leave your firewood at home](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/firewood.shtml) and use local or heat-treated firewood,\" said State Entomologist Allison Kanoti. \"In the case of the detection in Oakland, we can tell by evidence in the trees that the EAB has been lurking there for several years. Emerald ash borer is one of many insects and diseases that pose new threats to our trees, forests, environment, and economy. Many others can also hide in or on firewood and be transported to new places when we move firewood.\" Ash is an important cultural resource for the Wabanaki, an important street tree and a valuable timber species, accounting for around four percent of Maine's hardwood forest inventory. EAB threatens all ash tree species (excluding mountain-ash) and will have significant ecological and economic impacts on the state. Although pesticide treatments can protect individual trees, and biological control provides long-term hope for keeping ash as part of our forests, there are no practical means to control EAB in forested areas. What can I do to help slow the spread of EAB? - We can all support healthy forests in Maine. Help slow the spread of EAB and [other invasive forest pests](//www.maine.gov/forestpests)by [using local or certified heat-treated firewood](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/firewood.shtml)and encouraging others to do the same. - MFS encourages anyone who thinks they have seen EAB damage outside the areas where it has been confirmed to please report it. You can also help monitor for EAB through [visual surveys](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/EABsigns.shtml), participation in a [trap tree network](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab_trap_trees.htm)and [biosurveillance](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/insects/helpfulwasps_cerceris_fumipennis.htm). - Everyone can learn more about other invasive threats to forest health, look out for them, [report concerns](//appengine.egov.com/apps/me/dacf/mfs-tree-ailment), and spread word about them to help slow their spread. About the Emergency Order What does the order do? The order limits the movement of ash trees for planting and ash tree products such as logs, pulpwood, green lumber, and hardwood firewood from the order area. What is the order area? The order area covers Auburn, Durham, Greene, Lewiston, Lisbon, Mechanic Falls, Minot, Poland, Sabattus, Turner, and Wales in Androscoggin County; Albion, Belgrade, Benton, China, Clinton, Litchfield, Oakland, Rome, Sidney, Vassalboro, Waterville, and in Oxford County; and in Sagadahoc County and Fairfield, Norridgewock, Skowhegan, and Smithfield in Somerset County. This order area is in addition to areas described in the existing [state quarantine](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/index.shtml), Maine DACF, Agriculture Rules, Chapter 275, which includes areas in Maine and other states and Canada. If I'm only moving ash tree products within the order or quarantine area, do I need to worry about spreading EAB? EAB is not found everywhere within the order and quarantine areas. The MFS and our partners concerned with the future of ash trees in Maine encourage those involved in moving ash tree material within the regulated areas to follow [Best Management Practices](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/caps/EAB/documents/Ash_regulated_area-BMP.pdf) to reduce the spread of EAB. What is the best practice for firewood for my next outdoor recreation trip? The next time you head out to camp, fish, canoe, kayak, four-wheel, and otherwise enjoy the outdoors, follow these firewood tips. - Leave your firewood at home. - Buy firewood as close to your destination as possible. - Purchasing certified firewood is the best choice. Buy firewood with a state seal stating the wood has been heat-treated to 160 degrees Fahrenheit for at least 75 minutes. - Be sure to inspect the outside of packages of heat-treated firewood for pests that might hitch a ride after treatment (for example, look for browntail moth cocoons, spongy moth pupae, and spotted lanternfly eggs). - If certified firewood is not available, purchase your firewood as close as possible to where you will burn it. - At some sites, you may be able to gather firewood on or near the site. Check local rules. - Some sites, such as Baxter State Park, prohibit firewood from outside regardless of treatment status. - If youve already transported firewood, dont leave it or bring it home - burn it! - Be sure also to burn any small pieces of bark and debris that have fallen from the wood. - If you can't burn it all within 24 hours, follow firewood disposal and [drop-off directions](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/firewood.shtml#dropoff). - If the wood you find locally is not heat-treated and you don't burn it all, don't take it home with you or to your next destination.

Supporting documents Maine Animal Health Officials Issue Update Regarding Poultry Swaps and Exhibitions In Response to Bird Flu Cases July 1, 2022 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA- Today, due to another detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Maine in a small, non-commercial group of backyard birds on June 28, Maine Animal Health Officials with the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry, announced the continuation of their advisory recommending cancellation or postponement of competitions, exhibitions, shows, swaps, or other in-person events encouraging the gathering or comingling of domestic fowl or poultry. Advisory: The risk for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) remains high, and bird owners are advised to keep birds indoors to prevent the spread of this disease. The trends observed with past North American HPAI outbreaks are that we often see a reprieve in the summer months. Unfortunately, this is not the pattern observed in the current outbreak. Animal Health Officials in Maine now recommend that all competitions, exhibitions, shows, swaps, or other in-person events encouraging the gathering or comingling of domestic fowl or poultry be postponed until at least 30 days after the last detection of an infected flock in our state. If organizers proceed with a poultry event, follow these important guidelines for keeping birds and other flocks healthy. Most importantly: if a flock at home is not healthy, DO NOT go to the poultry show. Even if not bringing birds, clothes and footwear could carry disease into this environment. In addition: - Minimize contact with the birds on exhibit and with their environments - Wash hands on the way into and out of the exhibit - Clean and disinfect poultry cages between use - Keeping gallinaceous (chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl) birds physically separate from waterfowl at the exhibit is strongly recommended. Consider not bringing waterfowl to the exhibit, as they can carry this virus without showing signs of illness. - Be prepared to respond to suspect or confirmed cases of influenza: document show participant information, make a plan for restricting access to the exhibition barn, and keep contact information for state and local veterinarians handy. The risk assessment for HPAI transmission is ongoing and dependent on dynamic factors such as weather and wild bird migratory patterns. As the southern migration begins this Fall, adjustments to our flock management practices may remain necessary to protect these birds. Keep an eye on the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry website for new information about the status of the HPAI outbreak. Recommendations and regulations for Maine's bird owners can be found here: [maine.gov/dacf/ahw/animal_health/](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ahw/animal_health/).

But many of our favorite playgrounds, baseball fields, and neighborhood trails are conserved lands too, and they were made possible by the LWCF,\" said BPL Director Andy Cutko. \"This terrific new web resource demonstrates the importance of having outdoor places a ten or fifteen-minute drive from our homes.\" \"For 57 years, the LWCF has ensured Mainers ready access to the outdoors and helped protect some of the places we love best. It has strengthened our communities and economy,\" said Appalachian Mountain Club Maine Conservation Policy Director Eliza Townsend. \"Now, the public and our elected representatives will be able to appreciate its impact. AMC is proud to partner with the State of Maine to make this information available.\" Two Maine Conservation Corps environmental stewards dedicated over 3,000 hours of service to creating the interactive recreation map. The process involved converting 2,700 paper records into a dynamic GIS database. An additional position included in the recently enacted state budget will support improvements to the map and help ensure that resources developed through the fund remain permanently available to the public. Since 1964, royalties paid by companies drilling for oil and gas on the Outer Continental Shelf have been dedicated to LWCF to protect national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges and to provide grants for state and local parks and outdoor recreation projects. Over the past six decades, the LWCF has played a pivotal role in ensuring those resources will be here for future generations. After years of diverting the program's specifically intended funds away from conservation, the LWCF was permanently funded in 2020 with the leadership of Maine's congressional delegation.

Governor Mills Announces 12 New Land for Maine's Future Projects September 29, 2022 Projects Include Historic Conservation of Deer Wintering Habitat at Reed Deadwater Governor Janet Mills today announced 12 Land for Maine's Future conservation projects across the State of Maine which will protect working lands and wildlife habitat and preserve public access to lakes, rivers, scenic views, and mountain vistas. The projects include Reed Deadwater, the states largest conservation project to protect deer wintering habitat to date. \"As an avid sportswoman myself, I always look forward to announcing new Land for Maines Future Projects that conserve our lands for the public, but today is a special day,\" said Governor Janet Mills. Today, we mark the states largest conservation project to protect deer wintering habitat, which will help restore this once iconic species in Northern Maine and renew the hope of sportsmen and women across our state. \"The Reed Deadwater Project is unique for both its size and scope. With over 3,000 acres of historic deer wintering habitat, this deer yard will provide critical winter cover for an array of important wildlife in Maine,\" said Commissioner of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Judy Camuso. \"At a time when more and more people are outside, conserving such a large parcel of unfragmented forestland has incredible benefits for both the people of Maine and our wildlife.\" With today's announcement, the LMF Board has approved 37 new projects since the Governor proposed and the Maine Legislature overwhelmingly approved $40 million to [reinvigorate the LMF program](https://www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/promise-kept-governor-mills-signs-strong-bipartisan-budget-achieving-55-percent-education) through the biennial budget. Of the 12 projects announced today, three projects will preserve working farmland, four projects will preserve working waterfronts, and five projects will preserve working forests. The projects, which total $7.7 million and are expected to leverage an additional $24 million in private and federal funds, are: - Reed Deadwater: The Reed Deadwater area is a 6,300-acre parcel in southern Aroostook County that contains over 3,000 acres of historic deer wintering habitat, along with habitat for many at-risk species. It abuts an additional 45,000 acres of conserved land. There are 2,500 acres of significant wetlands supporting rare species, as the Reed Deadwater contains a rare eccentric bog ecosystem. Upland portions of this property support significant deer wintering habitat, and the wetlands provide abundant wading bird and waterfowl habitat and are also home to globally rare and state threatened Tomah Mayflies. Macwahoc Stream flows through the deadwater and contains a population of state threatened Brook Floater Mussels and the stream is in Atlantic salmon critical habitat. The waterway is also an excellent flatwater paddle trip for kayakers and canoers. Once completed, the project will be the single largest acquisition in the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlifes history and the states most significant purchase to conserve deer wintering habitat. - Kennebago Woodlands (Stetson Twp) - The Kennebago 5,000+ acre addition to the Kennebago Headwaters project previously selected by the LMF Board. The conservation of this property will protect the uplands area and tributary streams of the Kennebago River. Management of the property will balance commercial timber values and the protection of sensitive habitats. - Mill Hill and Edwards Mill Forests (Oxford and Cumberland Counties) - This multi-parcel project spans multiple towns and counties in southwestern Maine. It includes over 3 miles of frontage on the Crooked River, the largest tributary to Sebago Lake, and critical spawning grounds for Maine's native land-locked salmon population. Sebago Lake provides the drinking water supply to 1/6th of Maine's population. - Square Lake - Cross Lake (Aroostook County) - This 4,000+ acre property will be acquired by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestrys Bureau of Public Lands (BPL) and added to their Square Lake Public Lands unit. This acquisition will support public access to over five miles of shore frontage on Square and Cross Lakes. The property also includes multiple high-value natural resources. Property management will be consistent with BPL's multiple-use mandate, balancing timber management and public use. - Chadbourne Tree Farm (Bethel) - This multi-parcel project will protect over 10,000 acres with a working forest conservation easement held by BPL. The properties collectively include a mix of high-value timberlands and wetlands and connect with existing recreational resources in the greater Bethel region. - E & E Farm (Lisbon) - A 274-acre property just outside of Lisbon Falls, ME, with 119 acres of open space and 154 acres of forest, the land at E&E is well situated for a variety of cattle and dairy enterprises. It has been home to a dairy herd and heifer operation in the Smith Family at different points in its 100+ year history. With the farm's proximity to the Brunswick, Lewiston/Auburn, and Greater Portland metropolitan areas, development pressure in the area is strong. - Roseberry Farm (Richmond) - One of the larger contiguous tracts of dairyland still under active management in the area at over 1,000 acres, Roseberry Farm provides a unique opportunity for a livestock-based business to thrive in the future. - New Leaf Farm (Durham) - A 74-acre farm that has been home to one of Maine's pioneer organic vegetable operations, this easement will enable the current owners to work on a succession plan. Development pressure has led to the conversion of significant amounts of open space in the area. The New Leaf property is adjacent to 340 acres of conservation land surrounding Runaround Pond and is only a few miles from several other thriving agricultural operations. - Sea Meadow Marine Foundation (Yarmouth) - A nonprofit 50l(c)(3) preserving and protecting the \"Even Keel Boatyard\" to provide affordable access to individuals and families who make their living directly or indirectly from the sea. This land is the last exclusively working waterfront site in the Yarmouth/Freeport area. - Small Point Development Corporation (Phippsburg) - A 61-year-old jointly owned shareholder corporation run by local fishermen and summer residents, this project permanently protects working waterfront for commercial fishing and aquaculture and preserves the community's shared vision as a traditional, multi-use Maine harbor. - Fisherman's Wharf (Swan's Island) - The only landing on the Minturn side of the Island and one of two public landings on the Island, currently unusable because of disrepair. This project will revitalize the Warf to ensure the public's safe use, transforming it into a vital commercial outlet that can make valuable contributions to the local economy. - Evelyn D LLC Working Waterfront (Harpswell) - Preserving the heritage and history of commercial fishing and boat building in Harpswell and ensuring future generations can operate the property as a working waterfront. \"Access to Maine's working waterfront continues to face development pressure that can undermine our state's vital commercial fishing and aquaculture industries,\" said LMF Board Chair and Commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources Patrick Keliher. \"Thanks to Governor Mills' support for Maine's valuable heritage industries, important infrastructure that is so necessary for a strong and resilient coastal economy has been preserved and protected.\" \"It's an exciting day to be moving three farm projects forward based on the due diligence and recommendations of LMF's Working Farmland Access Protection Program committee,\" said Commissioner of the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Amanda Beal. \"These farms are all located in areas of the state experiencing growing development pressure. Likewise, having the opportunity to protect such significant working forests and recreational lands will continue to benefit our state and local communities in numerous ways now and for generations to come.\" The Land for Maine's Future Program is the State of Maine's primary method of conserving land for its natural and recreational value. The program was established in 1987 when Maine citizens approved a $35 million bond to fund the purchase of land and easements. The program's priority is to conserve the Maine landscape, recognizing that working lands and public access to these lands are critical to preserving Maine's quality of life. Since then, LMF has conserved over 610,000 acres of land, including 333,425 acres of working lands. This work includes 70 water access sites with over 67 miles of shoreline on rivers, lakes, and ponds, 41 farms and 9,884 acres of protected farmlands, 30 working waterfront properties, 158 miles of former railroad corridors for recreational trails and over 69 miles of coastal access.

The $60 million PFAS Fund, proposed by Governor Mills and passed by the State Legislature, will provide direct relief to Maine farmers impacted by PFAS contamination. \"Having a strong and dedicated leader to manage Maine's robust response to PFAS contamination is critically important,\" said Department of Agriculture Conservation and Forestry (DACF) Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"Beth is uniquely qualified to work with the PFAS Advisory Committee to establish criteria for the PFAS Fund and to oversee the implementation of a suite of programs to support impacted farmers.\" Valentine has worked as an attorney at Jackson and MacNichol in South Portland and with the Maine Community Law Center in Portland. She also previously worked with the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation/Waquoit Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Valentine's long-standing interest in agriculture and food systems also led to her participating in the Sustainable Food Leadership Institute and to contributing to the Conservation Law Foundation's New England Food Policy: Building a Sustainable Food System publication. She holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and a minor in Biology from Hamilton College in Clinton, NY; a Master of Art in Marine Affairs from the University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI; and a Juris Doctorate from the University of Maine School of Law in Portland. Valentine, who joined the DACF in September, will oversee the administration and coordination of the PFAS Fund, work with the PFAS Advisory Committee, and lead planning to establish funding priorities and implement the program(s) to allocate funds. \"I am excited to be working with DACF and the members of the PFAS Advisory Committee,\" said Director Valentine. \"My goal for the Fund and its programs is to provide meaningful support to farmers impacted by PFAS contamination and to boost funding for critical research to, among other things, develop remediation strategies to address PFAS contamination where it is found.\" The PFAS Fund was established through Governor Mills' Fiscal Year 2023 supplemental budget, which was approved by the Legislature in the last session, to address PFAS contamination of agricultural land through a suite of programs and approaches that may include: - Direct support to farmers such as income replacement and equipment, facilities, and infrastructure investments to enable farmers to transition to alternative cropping systems or implement remediation strategies; - Medical testing and monitoring of individuals whose agricultural land is contaminated by PFAS; - And research, for example, to support short-term farm management decisions and identify soil and water remediation systems. Today, the Mills Administration also announced the following fifteen individuals will serve as members of the PFAS Fund Advisory Committee: - Committee chairs: Senator Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland) and Representative Jessica Fay (D-Casco, Poland, and Raymond) - Senator Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) - Representative Randy Hall (R-Wilton) - Amanda Beal, DACF Commissioner - Melanie Loyzim, Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Commissioner - Nirav Shah, Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director - Diane Rowland, University of Maine College of Natural Sciences Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station Dean - Sherry Hamel, U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency State Executive Director - Rebecca Boulos, Maine Public Health Association Executive Director - Jenni Tilton Flood, Flood Brothers Farm - Steve Crane, Crane Brothers Farm - Jim Buckle, The Buckle Farm - Katia Holmes, Misty Brook Farm - Adrienne Lee, New Beat Farm \"PFAS contamination is a major issue for Mainers, especially our farmers. Thankfully, Maine is leading the way in addressing this problem head-on,\" said Sen. Stacy Brenner, who co-owns and operates Broadturn Farm. \"I'm incredibly proud of all the work the Maine legislature accomplished this session to stop the proliferation and spread of PFAS and invest in PFAS mitigation - including the PFAS fund.\" \"Maine is on the leading edge of the nationwide PFAS contamination crisis. A big part of that must be addressing farmer needs,\" said Rep. Jessica Fay. \"Affected Maine farmers' livelihoods and well-being are of the greatest importance. This process will take time and patience, but an excellent team with diverse knowledge and backgrounds is committed to the work.\" The PFAS Fund Advisory Committee was assembled following the representation requirements described in [LD 2013](//www.mainelegislature.org/legis/bills/display_ps.asp?ld=2013&PID=1456&snum=130). The PFAS Fund Advisory Committee will meet for orientation in October 2022 and begin holding regular working meetings in November. Under the leadership of the Governor, Maine established a PFAS Task Force in early 2019 and has since taken decisive action to address PFAS contamination, including: - Securing $30 million for PFAS remediation, which includes $10 million to help farmers impacted by PFAS, $15 million to provide safe drinking water, $5 million for environmental testing, and $5 million for managing PFAS-contaminated waste; - Securing $5 million to address PFAS through the Maine Jobs and Recovery Plan; - Securing $9.3 million to address PFAS through the Fiscal Year 2022-2023 supplemental budget; - Securing $60 million to create a PFAS Trust Fund; - Establishing drinking water standards for PFAS; - Establishing containment and reporting requirements for firefighting foam containing PFAS; - Installing more than 200 drinking water treatment systems; - Establishing wastewater sludge testing requirements and eliminating land spreading of PFAS contaminated sludge; - Establishing screening levels for PFAS in soil, wastewater, fish tissue, and milk, and; - Expanding the statute of limitations for Maine citizens to file claims for PFAS contamination. Under the Mills Administration, Maine has dedicated more than $100 million over the past two years to address PFAS impacts on Maine's farmers and communities.

Data from the [U.S. Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap/StateDroughtMonitor.aspx?ME) show nearly 8% of the state is abnormally dry (11 of 16 counties) and about 3% is experiencing moderate drought (6 of 16 counties) by area. An estimated 34% of Maine's population resides in abnormally dry or drought-stricken areas. Following our last meeting, August ended with normal streamflow conditions through most of Maine. These conditions worsened through mid-September, but this below normal condition was brief, however, as late September rains flipped the trend to above normal streamflows. August and September storms resulted in recharge in some of the groundwater monitoring wells hardest hit by drought and low snowpack over the last 2 years. While the recharge wasn't necessarily significant, it's a sign that intermittent storms are actually reaching the aquifers, instead of simply running off into streams, evaporating or quenching dry soil. \"Maine's water resources are starting to benefit from September rains, with streamflows in a mostly normal condition and below normal groundwater levels in western Maine showing improvement, as well,\" said Nick Stasulis, Data Section Chief of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Co-chair of the Drought Task Force. \"Below normal streamflows in northern Maine remain an area to watch but aren't particularly concerning at this time.\" A total of 95 dry private wells have been reported this season with 97% of those reported by the users as being residential. The month of August saw the greatest increase of dry wells reported this season. Maine homeowners with dry wells are encouraged to report this information on the [Dry Well Survey](https://maine-dry-well-survey-maine.hub.arcgis.com/). For assistance filling out the survey Mainers can either call 211 or 1-877-463-6207, or they can text their Maine zip code to 898-211. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Drinking Water Program (DWP) has not received any new reports of water quantity issues from public water systems (PWSs). The Stonington Water Company issued emergency mandatory water use restrictions on July 21, 2022, that are still in effect. The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestrys Maine Forest Service reports there have been 624 wildfires, burning a total of 390 acres, as of October 6, 2022. The five-year average is 646 wildfires. The Maine Farm and Ranch Stress Assistance Network, through the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry in partnership with multiple organizations in Maine, and managed by the University of Maine Cooperative Extension, seeks applicants for [Small Grants to Support Maine Agricultural Well-Being](https://extension.umaine.edu/agriculture/maine-frsan/agricultural-resilience/small-grants-application/).

Starting in February 2022, the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) reported detecting 12 cases of the disease in domestic birds, all involving non-commercial backyard flocks. DACF found these cases in six counties across the state. Though the DACF has not reported any HPAI cases in domestic bird flocks since June 29, 2022, the virus is still being detected in wild birds. Wild birds were the most likely source of infection for three cases of HPAI reported in New England domestic birds this fall. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife (MDIFW) will continue to update its [website](//www.maine.gov/IFW/fish-wildlife/wildlife/living-with-wildlife/diseases/avian-influenza.html)with information about HPAI in wild birds and mammals. These wild bird detections, coupled with the fall migration, mean it is necessary to continue following preventive measures to protect domestic flocks and keep birds healthy.

AUGUSTA -Many Maine residents' holiday celebrations are incomplete without decorating with Maine-grown wreaths, trees, and other decorative plant material. Sending wreaths and trees to our friends and families across the country can help us feel connected even if we can't be together this holiday season. The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) reminds Mainers sending holiday greenery that they can save time and money and prevent product loss by shipping only healthy plant material. \"Shippers should be aware of the many state laws and regulations regarding the movement of plants and forest products,\" warned Carole Neil, Assistant Horticulturist with DACF. \"Many states closely monitor shipments to prevent the introduction of invasive insects and plant diseases. By planning, Maine shippers can speed up deliveries in this time-sensitive industry.\" DACF offers this advice for wreath and tree shippers: \"Import requirements for cut trees and holiday decorations including greenery, ornamental nuts, and fruit exist to protect regional agriculture and natural resources from the risk of plant pests,\" explained Sarah Scally, Assistant Horticulturist. \"An insect or plant disease in Maine could potentially be invasive in other states.

Mills Administration Announces Next Call for Proposals for Land for Maine's Future Program December 13, 2022 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Requests focus on projects of statewide significance, community conservation, and working forests. AUGUSTA - The Mills Administration announced two new calls for proposals through the Lands for Maine's Future Program (LMF). The requests are for projects of statewide significance, community conservation, and working forests and build on numerous successful proposals for conservation, recreation, water access, and working waterfront preservation. The LMF is the State's primary method of conserving land for its natural and recreational value. The program was established in 1987 when Maine citizens approved a $35 million bond to fund land purchases and easements. The program's priority is to conserve more of Maine's landscape, recognizing that permanently protecting lands with exceptional natural or recreational value is critical to maintaining our quality of life. Since its inception, LMF has conserved over 610,000 acres of land, including 333,425 working lands. This work includes 70 water access sites with over 67 miles of shoreline on rivers, lakes, and ponds, 41 farms and 9,884 acres of protected farmlands, 30 working waterfront properties, 158 miles of former railroad corridors for recreational trails, and over 69 miles of coastal access. The Fund was nearly depleted before Governor Mills and Legislature approved a $40 million infusion in the 2022-2023 fiscal budget. \"Maine people value the outdoors, and I am proud that through this call for proposals we are continuing the important work of preserving our cherished lands and waters for generations to come,\" said Governor Janet Mills. The Calls for Proposals The first, Round A, is for Projects of Statewide Significance and Community Conservation Projects. Round A Inquiry Forms are due by 5:00 PM, January 13, 2023. Final Round A Proposals are due by 5:00 PM, March 24, 2023. The Second, Round B, is for Working Forest Projects. Round B Inquiry Forms are due by 5:00 PM, May 19, 2023. Final Round B Proposals are due by 5:00 PM, August 4, 2023. Eligible LMF applicants include non-profit land conservation organizations, cities, towns, and state agencies. A copy of the LMF Workbook, which consists of all information necessary to apply for LMF funds, are available now on the [LMF web pages](//www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf/). \"The Land for Maine's Future program is critically important for the protection of Maine's valuable wilderness areas, support for our heritage industries, and the opportunity for a healthy and prosperous future for Maine communities,\" said Pat Keliher, Land for Maine's Future Board Chair and Commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources. \"This call for proposals is an outstanding opportunity for municipalities and other conservation-driven organizations to come forward with concepts to protect access to the outdoors and permanently prevent development, deforestation, and habitat loss,\" said Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal. In September 2022, Governor Mills [announced 12 LMF conservation projects](//www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-mills-announces-12-new-land-maines-future-projects-2022-09-29#:~:text=The%20Land%20for%20Maine's%20Future,purchase%20of%20land%20and%20easements.)which protect working lands and wildlife habitats and preserve public access to lakes, rivers, scenic views, and mountain vistas. The projects included Reed Deadwater, the State's largest conservation project to protect deer wintering habitat. In June 2022, the Governor [announced 20 LMF conservation projects](//www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-mills-announces-20-new-land-maines-future-conservation-projects-2022-06-06). Of the 20 projects, one-third of the applications came from municipalities - including Fryeburg, North Berwick, Owls Head, Portland, Searsmont, and Windham to conserve recreation areas. Four projects in Ellsworth, Fryeburg, Machiasport, and Oxford are located adjacent to or near public schools, delivering opportunities for nature-based learning and outdoor recreation. In January 2022, the Governor [announced the first new LMF projects to be funded since 2017](//www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-mills-announces-five-new-land-maines-future-conservation-projects-2022-01-26). The selected projects reflected the goals of [LD 404, An Act to Preserve Deer Habitat](//legislature.maine.gov/bills/display_ps.asp?snum=130&paper=HP0288PID=1456), which was approved by the Legislature and signed into law by the Governor last year by giving preferential consideration to projects that conserve deer wintering habitat. The Caribou Stream Deer Winter Area project conserved 930 acres of priority deer wintering habitat in Woodland and Washburn in Aroostook County.

The rangers and I look forward to this opportunity and work to make the artist comfortable and confident in this endeavor,\" said AWW Superintendent Mark Deroche. Here's what past artists to say: The 2021 AWW Visiting Artist Marty Cotter of Columbus, Ohio, shared that her Maine experience led to two national park residencies, Capital Reed National Park in Utah and Great Basin National Park in Nevada. \"I look back at my AWW Visiting Artist experience as a time of creative growth. The solitude gave me the freedom to explore my surroundings in detail. My resulting pieces were more developed in capturing the detail and mood of the scenes and creatures of the waterway.\" - AWW Visiting Artist Marty Cotter. Michael Vermette of Indian Island, Maine, the 2020 AWW Visiting Artist, used the experience to further his skills and connected the journey to his mission to \"reveal the currents and energy of his surroundings.\" \"There is no better adventure, no greater teacher, and no inspiring awakening that is more profound than to find yourself isolated and able to create on 92 miles of Maine's wildest lake and river system. The Allagash Wilderness Waterway Visiting Artist Program gives the artist that unique opportunity to be immersed in a raw beauty that will not only cause any painter to evolve productively but to have their soul washed, as Henry David Thoreau's writings continue to wash our spirits, even today!\" AWW Visiting Artist Michael E.

Supporting documents Commissioner Beal Announces Recipient of the 2023 Commissioner's Distinguished Service Award January 11, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA, Maine - Yesterday, Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) Commissioner Amanda Beal named Caitlin Hunter the recipient of the 2023 Commissioner's Distinguished Service Award. Hunter invested more than 40 years in raising goats and making cheese and has been called the \"Bedrock of the Maine Cheese Guild\" and \"cheesemaker extraordinaire.\" The Commissioner's Distinguished Service Award is presented to individuals who have significantly contributed to Maine agriculture. The award was presented at the DACF's [Maine Agricultural Trades Show](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/market_promotion/agtradesshow/)Commissioner's Luncheon on Tuesday, January 10, 2023, in front of representatives of all four Congressional offices, state legislators, past DACF Commissioners, and over 300 friends of Maine agriculture. \"I am honored to present Caitlin Hunter with the Distinguished Service Award. She has earned this recognition because of her pioneering vision, determination, and ongoing mentorship and support of newer cheesemakers that has helped to foster innovation and creativity, as well as growth in the number of creameries in Maine,\" Commissioner Beal said. \"Cheesemakers across Maine applaud Caitlin today for inspiring an industry with her remarkable skill and leadership.\" Caitlin Hunter's cheese making started over three decades ago when she began selling her soft goat cheeses at a local farmers' market. In a little over a decade, she acquired more goats, built a barn and a brand, and received state licensing for Appleton Creamery. Her products reached consumers through sales at the Belfast and Camden Farmers' Markets. With support from MOFGA, she and other cheese makers formed the Maine Cheese Guild in 2003. Through guild classes, the skill set of Maine cheese makers expanded, and the Maine artisan cheese sector was launched. Today, after retiring from cheesemaking to enjoy life with her husband, Brad, she offers her knowledge to the industry through her consulting business, Capercaillie Consulting. What Maine's cheese making community is saying \"As the Maine Cheese Guild celebrates its 20th anniversary in 2023, it is exciting to see one of its principal founders receive recognition for the hard work and dedication it takes to succeed in running a cheesemaking business while mentoring many others along the way. Since forming the Guild in 2003 with Caitlin's leadership, we have grown from a couple of dozen cheese producers to over 80. I offer heartfelt congratulations to Caitlin from myself and her many friends throughout the entire cheesemaking community for receiving this honor from Commissioner Beal.\" - Ron Dyer, Executive Director, Maine Cheese Guild \"Caitlin has been the Bedrock of the Maine Cheese Guild going back to the beginning when she served as its first President. It goes further back, however, as she is one of the 'Original Goatmothers' who created the modern Maine cheese movement we know today. It was Caitlin, together with women like Barbara Brooks from Seal Cove Farm, Marge Lupien from Mystique, Penny and John Duncan from York Hill farm, Pixie Day of Sleighbell Farm, and Helen Ramsdale from Ram's Farm, that re-established a cheesemaking culture in Maine that had been snuffed out by post-WW2 industrialization,\" said Eric Rector, Maine Cheese Guild Treasurer and owner of Monroe Cheese Studio. \"Having worked as a fellow cheesemaker in Maine for the past 20 years, I feel qualified to attest to Caitlin's cheesemaking passion and skills. Besides being one of the hardest-working women, she has always been generous with her knowledge, moral support, goats, and even her cheesemaking facility. And a tireless promoter of all Maine cheeses. Besides, she makes damned good cheese that is always beautifully displayed. I am so pleased that she has earned this well-deserved award,\" said Anne Bossi, owner of Sunset Acres Farm and Dairy. \"Caitlin is responsible for our Kennebec Cheesery success. I first met her at a Women in Agriculture conference soon after we arrived from New Zealand in 2001 and were deciding what farming direction to take. We had thought about a goat cheese operation, and she wholeheartedly encouraged us. I attended the first cheesemaking workshops she organized through the Maine Cheese Guild and, in 2006, bought ten of her young stock, which became the foundation of our herd. She has been a wonderful mentor to us and many others here in Maine. Congratulations, Caitlin, on this well-deserved honor,\" said Jean Koons, Maine Cheese Guild Board Member and owner of Kennebec Cheesery. Two Commissioner's Distinguished Service Awards were presented through online ceremonies while the show was staged virtually. [Penelope (Penny) Jordan](//www.maine.gov/dacf/about/news/news.shtml?id=3987596), a fourth-generation farmer in Cape Elizabeth and local community organizer, earned the 2021 award.

Maine is home to 176 dairy farms that care for herds of dairy cows, goats, and sheep and steward 700,000 acres of fields, pastures, and croplands. Because of their work, the state boasts award-winning cheeses, yogurt, ice cream, and butter made exclusively with Maine milk and cream. Maine is among states where micro-creameries can heat-treat fresh and fermented dairy products, such as yogurt and cheeses, and sell to shoppers under a state dairy licensing program, which has helped establish nearly 80 micro-dairies. Maine dairy farmers and creameries provide 4,733 direct and 10,201 indirect jobs, generating an estimated $904 million in direct and $1 billion in indirect economic impact.

AUGUSTA - The Mills Administration announced its second call for proposals through the Land for Maine's Future Program (LMF) in a little over a month. The latest requests are for conservation and recreation projects that protect working forest land and for Working Farmland Access and Protection Program projects. The LMF is the State's primary method of conserving land for its natural and recreational value. The Program was established in 1987 when Maine citizens approved a $35 million bond to fund land purchases and easements. The Program's priority is to conserve more of Maine's landscape, recognizing that permanently protecting lands with exceptional natural or recreational value is critical to maintaining our quality of life. Since its inception, the LMF has conserved over 610,000 acres of land, including 333,425 acres of working lands. This includes 70 water access sites with over 67 miles of shoreline on rivers, lakes, and ponds, 41 farms and 9,884 acres of protected farmlands, 30 working waterfront properties, 158 miles of former railroad corridors for recreational trails, and over 69 miles of coastal access. The Fund was nearly depleted before Governor Mills and Legislature approved a $40 million infusion in the 2022-2023 fiscal budget. \"Maine people value the outdoors, and I am proud that this call for proposals - the second in just over a month -- is continuing the important work of preserving our cherished lands and waters for generations to come,\" said Governor Janet Mills. Important Dates The Calls for Proposal Working Forests Working forests provide many public benefits, from ensuring a sustainable wood supply to support our forest economy to public access for traditional outdoor recreation pursuits. They provide wildlife habitat and are a critical component of the State's strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by sequestering carbon, as outlined in the State's Climate Action Plan, [Maine Won't Wait](//www.maine.gov/climateplan/). Eligible projects include the acquisition of Town forests, drinking water supply protection, properties that protect deer wintering habitat, and working forest easements on commercial timberland. An application to LMF requires sponsorship from a suitable state agency. Applications must include full knowledge and agreement from the landowner that their project is up for consideration for LMF funding. Funds often assist land trusts, municipalities and state agencies in meeting their conservation goals. Working Farmland The Working Farmland Access and Protection Program (WFAPP) provides funding to protect Maine's productive and economically significant farmland through the acquisition of agricultural conservation easements. On these protected properties, WFAPP encourages agricultural practices that support soil health, carbon sequestration, and the long-term productivity of protected farmland. WFAPP also seeks to protect properties that support farming operations in areas of the state that anchor a viable agricultural economy, that benefit beginning farmers or underserved communities, and that provide multiple public benefits such as protection of wildlife habitat or sensitive ecosystems. Agricultural conservation easements can provide farmers with capital to improve stewardship of their land while placing lasting protections on their property, ensuring these lands will be available for agricultural production for generations to come. All projects must be sponsored by the Bureau of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Resources and interested applicants are encouraged to [connect with Bureau staff](mailto:alexander.redfield@maine.gov)to discuss their proposals. Eligible LMF applicants include non-profit land conservation organizations, cities, towns, state agencies, or other organizations that are eligible holders of conservation easements under [Title 33 M.R.S.A, Section 476(2)](//legislature.maine.gov/statutes/33/title33ch7sec0.html). A copy of the LMF Workbook, which consists of all information necessary to apply for LMF funds, is available now on the [LMF web page](//www.maine.gov/dacf/lmf/). \"As the development pressure on our state's farmland and forests continues to grow, we are calling for proposals to preserve more Maine farmland and forests permanently. Doing so is critical to achieving our state's goals to ensure a viable land base for our agricultural and forestry sectors, now and for generations to come,\" said Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Commissioner Amanda Beal. In January 2022, [the Governor announced the first new LMF projects to be funded since 2017](//www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-mills-announces-five-new-land-maines-future-conservation-projects-2022-01-26). The selected projects reflected the goals of [LD 404](//legislature.maine.gov/bills/display_ps.asp?snum=130&paper=HP0288PID=1456), An Act to Preserve Deer Habitat, which was approved by the Legislature and signed into law by the Governor last year by giving preferential consideration to projects that conserve deer wintering habitat. The Caribou Stream Deer Wintering Area project conserved 930 acres of priority deer wintering habitat in Woodland and Washburn in Aroostook County. In June 2022, [the Governor announced 20 additional LMF conservation projects](//www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-mills-announces-20-new-land-maines-future-conservation-projects-2022-06-06)selected for funding by the LMF Board. Of the 20 projects, one-third of the applications came from municipalities including Fryeburg, North Berwick, Owls Head, Portland, Searsmont, and Windham to conserve recreation areas. Four projects in Ellsworth, Fryeburg, Machiasport, and Oxford are located adjacent to or near public schools, delivering opportunities for nature-based learning and outdoor recreation. In September 2022, [Governor Mills announced 12 more LMF conservation projects](//www.maine.gov/governor/mills/news/governor-mills-announces-12-new-land-maines-future-projects-2022-09-29)slated to move forward, protecting working lands and wildlife habitats and preserving public access to lakes, rivers, scenic views, and mountain vistas. The projects included Reed Deadwater, the state's largest conservation project to protect deer wintering habitat. In December 2022, [the Governor announced a new call for proposals through LMF](https://www.maine.gov/dacf/about/news/news.shtml?id=9811101). The request was for conservation and recreation projects of statewide significance and community conservation projects, which will build on the numerous successful proposals from the last 35 years. Tools and Tips for Helping To Knock Out More Browntail Moths February 1, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA, Maine - To draw increased attention to the risks presented to humans by the browntail moth (BTM), the Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry announced February as Browntail Moth Awareness Month. Winter is the best time to spot, clip and destroy the caterpillars lying dormant in their winter webs. Web removal prevents more caterpillars from emerging, thus reducing the risk of toxic hairs, which can cause poison ivy-like rash and asthma-like reactions in humans. BTM has been in an outbreak phase since 2015, and the rash- and itch-causing pest cannot be eradicated. Comprehensive BTM tools and tips and data-informed resources compiled by the Maine Forest Service, Board of Pesticides Control, Maine Center for Disease Control, the University of Maine, and other partners, including research, infestation tracking, FAQs, and educational materials for communities, municipalities, businesses, and healthcare providers, are available on [maine.gov/dacf/knockoutbtm](//www.maine.gov/dacf/knockoutbtm). Three Steps to Maximize the Effectiveness of BTM Awareness Month Step One - Know the Four Rs to Reduce BTM populations in Maine Recognize [BTM winter webs](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/insects/browntail_moth_id_winter_nests.htm)in the trees where you live, work, or play. Knowing where BTM winter webs are in your yard or town can help inform your management decisions and aid in removal to prevent impacts from the toxic hairs. Remove BTM webs with [hand snips or an extendable pole pruner](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/browntail_moth_info.htm#diy)in areas within reach of the ground and away from hazards such as powerlines. Protect your eyes and skin from hairs that might be present from past caterpillar activity. After removal, [destroy the webs](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/browntail_moth_info.htm#diy). Recruit [professional help](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/browntail_moth_info.htm#survey)to treat BTM webs out of reach or near hazards on the property you own or manage. [Licensed professional arborists](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/arborist/index.shtml)can remove BTM webs in larger trees and shrubs in the winter. Some arborists offer web-clipping services using drones. Licensed pesticide applicators may be able to help control BTM adult breeding activities during the growing season. Reach out if you have concerns about BTM. Neighbors, business owners, and community members can come together to respond to the problem and achieve greater results. Consider hosting your own BTM web clipping event in your neighborhood to reduce the itch for your family and your community! Step Two: Participate and Share BTM Awareness Month Events Participating in BTM knowledge-building activities and events can help you become more informed about BTM and bolster the momentum and energy needed to organize community web clipping or BTM mapping events. The following list is a sample of events and activities across the state.

The event surpassed our expectations, both in terms of the number of potential customers we spoke with, as well as the revenue we earned.\" Prevent contact with wild birds : Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Situational Report February 9, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA - The risk for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) remains high in Maine, and backyard flock and commercial operators are urged to prevent contact between domestic and wild birds by bringing them indoors and ensuring their outdoor areas are fully enclosed. Since February 2022, USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories have confirmed the presence of HPAI in seventeen Maine non-commercial backyard flocks (non-poultry) located in Knox, Lincoln, York, Washington, Waldo, Cumberland, Hancock, and Kennebec Counties, and one non-commercial backyard flock (poultry) in Cumberland County. All confirmed cases are listed on the [APHIS website](//www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-2022/2022-hpai-commercial-backyard-flocks). Four properties, two in Hancock County and one each in Kennebec and Washington Counties are currently under quarantine. No surveillance zones are being placed around non-poultry premises per USDA policy changes implemented during November 2022. Resources for backyard flock and commercial flock owners HPAI Common Questions Q: How do I protect my flock from HPAI? A: The best approach is to [practice good biosecurity](https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/defend-the-flock-program/!ut/p/z1/lZLNcoIwFIWfxQVLzE1Qwe6AMoBF26pUmk0HFQMtECamOuPTN9pu-qPSbDJJvnPP3HuCKEoQrdNdwVJZ8Dot1fmZDl5CQlyMezjyR0MLHl0D-tMH35hhEy1OQHTfc7EzA7V7Dtje1Bx7XkgAG4j-T_8UDJR-Hs8nFnbCIWmnhzPLhnb6CwC9XH50zUBNkIixO2aINqnM9aLecJSss01Wr3WZZ_qm5Ks3vRGcibS68LJA9OQ1wa4P1tHLu8VgB8PwLjAHAD75As6FMb0GHNP6AfyOo8VAWMmXn3_HrpeGpToXqimRie67UNe5lM32RgMN9vt9l3HOyqy74pUGf0lyvpUo-U6iporjODlEARTha7_cRXan8wGokCNS/?1dmy&urile=wcm%3apath%3a%2Faphis_content_library%2Fsa_our_focus%2Fsa_animal_health%2Fsa_animal_disease_information%2Favian%2Fdefend-the-flock-program%2Fdtf-biosecurity%2Fbiosecurity101)- this means keeping your birds separate from sources of disease, such as infected wild birds and their environment. Q: What are the signs of HPAI in birds? A: Sudden death without clinical signs; Lack of energy and appetite; Decreased egg production or soft-shelled or misshapen eggs; Swelling of the head, comb, eyelid, Purple discoloration of Incoordination; or Diarrhea. [Learn more](//www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/animal-disease-information/avian/defend-the-flock-program/outbreak-illness/outbreak-illness). Q: What should I do if I have sick birds or large mortality in my flock? A: Report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to State/Federal officials, either through your [state veterinarian](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ahw/animal_health/index.shtml)or through contract AI? A: No cases of this particular strain of the avian influenza virus have been detected in humans in the United States. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, recent detections of this strain of influenza in birds in Maine and several other states [present a low risk to the public](//www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2021-2022/bird-flu-poses-low-risk-public.htm). Q: Does HPAI present a food safety risk? A: No, poultry and eggs are safe to eat when handled and cooked properly. Q: Is compensation offered to impacted flock owners? A: Yes. Refer to the [USDA APHIS website (PDF)](//www.aphis.usda.gov/publications/animal_health/2016/hpai-indemnity.pdf)to learn what is covered and how the process works. Avian Influenza and Human Health DACF's Animal Health team is also working closely with the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC). Though this strain of avian influenza has not been detected in humans in the United States, Maine CDC is monitoring the health and wellbeing of Animal Health staff and flock owners who were exposed out of an abundance of caution. Signs and symptoms of bird flu infections in people can include fever (temperature of 100F or greater) or feeling feverish, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, fatigue, headaches, eye redness (or conjunctivitis), and difficulty breathing. Other possible symptoms are diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. As with seasonal flu, some people are at high risk of getting very sick from bird flu infections, including pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems, and people 65 and older. The U.S. CDC provides information on [avian flu transmission at this link](//www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/avianflu/avian-flu-transmission.pdf). The Maine CDC's Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory is prepared to process samples and quickly provide results for anyone potentially exposed to the virus.

The SCBGP is a competitive grant program that funds innovative projects supporting Maine's expanding specialty crop sector and explore new market opportunities. Specialty crops include fruits, vegetables, nursery, floriculture, culinary herbs, maple, Christmas trees, and honey. Processed foods are eligible, provided their development enhances the competitiveness of one or more specialty crops. Visit the [USDA AMS website](//www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/scbgp/specialty-crop)for a complete list of eligible crops. The DACF administers the SCBGP each year and will evaluate all applications for eligibility based on the criteria listed in the application package. Qualified project applications will be reviewed and scored by a panel of industry stakeholders. All DACF-approved projects will be incorporated into one state grant request, which will be submitted to the United States Department of Agriculture- Agricultural Marketing Service (USDA-AMS). \"In 2022, Maine awarded $562,000 for seven projects. We anticipate $653,000 this year,\" said DACF Agricultural Resource Development Division Director Michelle Webb. \"As Maine farmers seek to diversify their production, these grant awards provide important opportunities for innovation through specialty crop marketing, research, and education.\" Projects must demonstrate benefit to the broader specialty crop industry rather than to an individual or organization. Past and current awards have supported research into Maine's most crucial specialty crops, development of pest management and soil health strategies, and enhancement of market promotion and food safety projects. Applications that directly align with one or more DACF priority areas receive additional points in the scoring process and are more likely to receive a grant award. The 2023 priority areas are: - Any application from the previous year which was for a multiple-year term and was only funded for the first year of the project. For those projects that fit under this category, they must submit a new proposal and show progress from the first year's funding. - Projects that enhance food safety education, primarily in relation to FDA rules regarding improved handling and processing of specialty crops - Projects to enhance soil and ecosystem health - Projects that market Maine specialty crops to diversified and expanded markets, or that research potential market expansion efforts and strategies - Projects that improve adaptation and increase resilience to climate-related crop disturbances in support of long-term farm business vitality and productivity - Projects that alleviate supply chain disruptions for specialty crop inputs, processing, or distribution \"DACF is so excited to be able to offer these resources to Maine's agricultural sector,\" said Craig Lapine, Director of the Maine Bureau of Agriculture, Food & Rural Resources. \"In the past, these grants have spurred exciting innovations in production, marketing, stewardship, and more. We have high hopes that this year's applicants will continue that tradition.\" Since 2006, the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program has awarded more than $8.5 million to Maine DACF to support the growing number of specialty crop producers selling into local and regional markets. DACF encourages applications that serve smaller farms and ranches, new and beginning farmers and ranchers, underserved producers, veteran producers, and underserved communities. Interested applicants should apply directly through their state departments of agriculture. Agricultural associations, industry and producer groups, municipalities, community-based organizations, educational institutions, and non-profits are eligible for this grant opportunity. Eligible groups must submit proposals for grants of up to $100,000 per project by 11:59 p.m. on Thursday, March 16, 2023. The 2023 SCBG application is available by searching under DACF on the [DAFS Procurement Services website](//www.maine.gov/dafs/bbm/procurementservices/vendors/grants). Maine's [2022 SCBGP awards](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/grants/usda_specialty_crop.shtml)supported several projects, including expanding marketing and infrastructure for the wild blueberry sparkling wine industry, providing technical assistance to farms for compliance with the Food Safety Modernization Act, and investigating practices to reduce a specific potato virus. Those interested can consult the RFA for more information. Questions may be submitted by February 24, 2023, to [SpecialtyCropBlockGrant@Maine.gov](mailto:SpecialtyCropBlockGrant@Maine.gov). Applications are now being accepted for Maine's Dairy Improvement Fund February 17, 2023 The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) is pleased to announce that [Dairy Improvement Fund (DIF) applications](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/grants/dairy-improvement-fund.shtml)are now being accepted. DIF provides financing to help Maine dairy businesses undertake projects to enhance their viability and vitality and improve product manufacturing, marketability, and production. DIF provides eligible borrowers loans of up to $250,000 at a 1% fixed interest rate for capital improvements. To be eligible, borrowers must be a dairy enterprise, farm, or business making milk products. Eligible borrowers must: keep cows, sheep, or goats that contribute milk to their products; be in Maine and currently producing milk products that are sold commercially; and propose a project that is an eligible use of the fund. Eligible uses include: - Designing, constructing or improving milking parlors, dairy barns, and structures, and dairy feed storage structures; or - Purchasing, constructing, or renovating buildings, land, and equipment to maintain and enhance the viability of an established dairy enterprise, dairy farm, or business making milk products DIF has financed improvements at a dozen Maine dairy businesses. Past funded projects range from purchasing a vat/pasteurizer, cooling tanks, ice cream maker, and storage tanks; to constructing a cheese cave; to creating a milking parlor, milk storage space, and new animal housing. What Farmers Are Saying About DIF The owners of The Milkhouse Dairy Farm and Creamery, Caitlin Frame and Andy Smith, applied for DIF financing because of the low-interest rate. The couple used the loan to build a new milking parlor and used funds to purchase a pickup truck and loader tractor to improve their hay operation. \"Locking in a 15-year loan at 1% greatly assisted our farm's cash flow and improved the efficiency and ergonomics of our daily chores. We highly recommend the program to other Maine dairies,\" - Caitlin Frame and Andy Smith. The owners of Balfour Farm, Heather and Doug Donahue, applied for DIF financing because of the interest rate and interest-only period, and because they have aged out of some Farm Service Agency programs. They used their loan to increase solar power on the farm, upgrade well pumps, and scale-up cheesemaking equipment. \"The interest rate is very attractive and the interest-only period allowed us to get the equipment in place and scale up before the full payments started. To everyone considering applying, plan and organize financial documents in advance, and be patient, the program takes time to work through the system,\" - Heather and Doug Donahue How to Apply Begin by learning more about the program and completing the [Project Eligibility Form](//www.maine.gov/dacf/ard/grants/dairy-improvement-fund.shtml). Curious applicants are invited to contact DACF's Agricultural Resource Development Division by emailing questions to [dacf@maine.gov](mailto:dacf@maine.gov)or by calling (207) 287-3491. DIF is a partnership between the DACF and the Finance Authority of Maine. DACF to Increase and Improve Access to Maine-Grown Foods for Older Adults Using New Federal Grant March 28, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Augusta, ME - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) announced today that it will utilize an $800,000 Federal grant to expand the Maine Senior FarmShare Program. The program provides low-income older adults the opportunity to receive up to a $50 share of fresh, local produce at no cost directly from Maine farmers.

New Emergency Order Area Announced as Invasive Emerald Ash Borer Continues Spread into Central Maine March 31, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) AUGUSTA, Maine - Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's (DACF) Maine Forest Service (MFS) announced the expansion of its Emergency Order restricting the movement of ash trees, green ash waste, ash firewood, and any other materials that may be a means of emerald ash border (EAB) transportation. The expansion follows the discovery of EAB infestations in Corinna and Newport in Penobscot County and Andover and Woodstock in Oxford County. The infestations are suspected to be the direct result of human movement of EAB. [The expanded Emergency Order](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab-emergencyorder.shtml)covers Androscoggin, Kennebec, Knox, Lincoln, Sagadahoc, of Aroostook, Franklin, Oxford, Penobscot Piscataquis, and Somerset Counties. The expansion is in addition to areas described in the existing [state quarantine](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab/index.shtml), Maine DACF, Agriculture Rules, Chapter 275, which includes regions of Maine and other states and Canada. Regulated ash items include: - All life stages of the EAB - Rooted ash (Fraxinus spp.) for planting (excluding mountain ash) - Hardwood firewood that has not been certified heat treated - Ash logs (i.e., roundwood and pulpwood) and green lumber from ash Frequently Asked EAB Questions Q: What is MFS's next step? A: MFS will coordinate listening sessions in April to gather input on EAB regulations in Maine. The sessions will be hybrid, allowing for in-person and online participation. Preliminary plans include meetings in Augusta, Old Town, and Houlton. The MFS [calendar of events](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/events.html)will list exact locations, dates, and times. Interested parties should [subscribe](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab/index.shtml)to receive EAB-related news. Q: How do we slow the spread of EAB? A: We help slow the spread of EAB and [other invasive forest pests](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/index.htm)using local and certified heat-treated firewood. Everyone is asked to encourage others to do the same and to learn and follow [best management practices](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab/documents/Ash_regulated_area-BMP.pdf)when handling ash in regulated areas. Q: What are the signs of EAB? A: Woodpeckers feeding on overwintering larvae create bright white spots called blonding. In Newport, an alert arborist discovered the woodpecker damage and contacted MFS. In Andover and Woodstock, MFS crews found the damage during routine surveys. Everyone is asked to report suspected EAB damage by emailing locations and photos to [foresthealth@maine.gov](mailto:foresthealth@maine.gov). Q: How does this impact the firewood movement from out of state into Maine? A: The [ban](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/firewood.shtml)on the movement of untreated firewood from out-of-state into Maine remains. Many tree-killing insects and diseases, in addition to EAB, can be moved with firewood. Everyone who burns firewood is asked to purchase local firewood (buy it where you burn it) and certified heat-treated firewood. Q: Do I need to worry about spreading EAB if I'm only moving ash tree products within the emergency order or quarantine area? A: Everyone should be concerned with the future of ash trees in Maine. MFS and its partners encourage everyone involved with moving ash tree material within the regulated areas to follow [Best Management Practices](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab/documents/Ash_regulated_area-BMP.pdf)to reduce the spread of EAB. Q: Where can I find more EAB information? A: The [MFS EAB webpage](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab/index.shtml)is the best resource for everyone concerned about EAB spread in Maine. Email questions about EAB and the Emergency Order to [foresthealth@maine.gov](mailto:foresthealth@maine.gov)or call (207) 287-2431.

Supporting documents Fire Safety Tips for Spring Fire Season April 11, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Old Town - The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Forest Protection Division urges caution and preparedness for spring wildfire season. Maine has already experienced over 40 wildfires, consuming over 100 acres, in 2023. Spring weather conditions are extremely conducive to wildfires. Ninety percent of all wildfires are caused by people, destroying natural resources and property and threatening human life. - Wildfire safety starts with knowing and obeying local laws and regulations. - Everyone is asked to check with their town hall, local fire service, or the Maine Forest Service before burning. Refer to [maineburnpermit.com](//www.maineburnpermit.com)for open burning permits. - Other critical steps to preventing wildfires include mindfulness of weather conditions, particularly wind, and using only easily controlled locations for burning. - Allow woodstove and fireplace ashes to cool before disposing of them. Place ashes in a tightly covered metal container and keep the ash container at least 10 feet away from the home and any other buildings. Never empty the ashes directly into a trash can. - Most importantly, never use flammable gas-propellants. Maine Wildfire Prevention Resources [Maine Forest Service Website](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/index.shtml) Report](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/wildfire_danger_report/index.html) [FireWise USA Training and Tips](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_protection/firewise/index.html) Maine Wildfire Common Questions Q: What are the leading causes of wildfires in Maine? A: The most common cause is escaped debris burning. Other leading causes include unattended campfires, equipment malfunction, and inappropriately discarded cigarettes. Ninety perfect of all fires are caused by people, so they are preventable. Q: Why is spring known as wildfire season in Maine? A: Most wildfires usually occur in April and May, when land- and homeowners are cleaning up their property. Dead vegetation makes for excellent fire fuel because it lacks moisture, making them highly flammable. The highest risk for spring wildfires occurs on dry, windy days, which can spread fires quickly. Q: How do I properly prepare for fire on or around my property or at a campsite? A: Keep fire extinguishers, buckets, shovels, ladders, and hose lengths handy. Have reliable telephones or two-way radios, and keep the local number for reporting fires handy. Q: Is there a proper way to extinguish a campfire? A: Drown the fire with water, ensuring all embers, coals, and sticks are completely soaked. Use a shovel to move rocks, check for embers, and stir/mix the coals with the water. Use the back of your hand to feel if the remaining coals are still hot. If you still feel the heat, add more water and stir the coals repeatedly until no heat can be felt. More questions?

Supporting documents Maine Forest Service Responds to Freight Train Derailment Near Rockwood, Maine April 15, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov)(207) 480-0558 Augusta, Maine - At approximately 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Saturday, April 15, 2023, a Canadian Pacific freight train derailed in Sandwich Academy Grant Township in Somerset County. The Maine Forest Service, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, and local emergency first responders responded. A total of three locomotive engines and six rail cars carrying lumber and electrical wiring derailed into a wooded area, where they caught fire and started a small forest fire. The fires are contained and are being monitored. Additional rail cars transporting hazardous materials did not derail. The assessment of officials on the scene is that these hazardous materials are not at risk of leaking and are not at risk of catching fire. It is also the assessment of officials on the scene that there is no threat to public health or safety, though officials continue to ask that the public avoid the area. Three railroad employees were sent to the hospital for non-life-threatening injuries. An early assessment indicates that the derailment may have been caused by a build-up of melting ice and debris that washed out part of the railroad track. The Maine Forest Service, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, and local emergency first responders remain on the scene, and a unified command has been established in Jackman. A Canadian Pacific operations team is also onsite and will provide more details on the status of all rail cars. Maine Forest Service Provides Status Update on Train Derailment April 16, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Augusta, MAINE - Following yesterday's derailment of a Canadian Pacific freight train in Sandwich Academy Grant Township in Somerset County, Canadian Pacific is leading a salvage, clean up, and rail repair operation in partnership with the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Maine Forest Service, the Maine Department of Environmental Protection, and the Jackman-Moose River Fire & Rescue Department. This effort involves removing the derailed locomotives and rail cars, cleaning up debris from the accident, and repairing the rail line. There is no estimate at this time for how long this effort will take. Officials continue to ask that people avoid the area while work remains ongoing. The fires stemming from the derailment have burned out, and officials report that the derailment poses no threat to public safety. The rail cars transporting hazardous substances were removed from the scene last night. The three railroad employees who sustained non-life-threatening injuries were treated and released from the hospital. No further injuries were reported.

Critical 13,500-Acre Section of Western Maine Protected May 12, 2023 The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Bureau of Parks and Lands (BPL) is pleased to share the following news in partnership with the Trust for Public Land and The Nature Conservancy in Maine. This press release provides information on the permanent protection of Quill Hill and Perham Stream. In addition to sharing this news, BPL would also like to extend its sincere appreciation and congratulations to everyone involved in this important conservation project. PORTLAND, Maine (May 11, 2023) - Two key properties totaling 13,640-acres in the Western Maine Mountains - Quill Hill and Perham Stream have been permanently protected. All of the acreage will be open for public use, and a majority will continue to be managed with timber harvests. This conservation project was led by Trust for Public Land, The Nature Conservancy in Maine, and The State of Maine's Bureau of Parks and Lands with lead public funding from the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Navy. These lands are part of the traditional territory and of ongoing cultural significance to the Wabanaki People. They are also key parts of a priority landscape for enhancing carbon storage and ensuring species can adapt to a changing climate. Quill Hill and Perham Stream are vitally important to the regions economy, outdoor recreation, forest products industry, climate resilience, wildlife habitat, healthy watersheds, and quality of life. They are prominent in the landscapes visible from the Appalachian Trail, Mt. Abraham, and the Rangeley Lakes Scenic Byway and adjacent to the wilderness training facility operated by the U.S. Navy in Redington Township. The 7,062-acre Quill Hill property-just 10 minutes from Rangeleyis a well-known destination that welcomes 30,000 visitors a year, drawn to its 360-degree view of the Western Maine Mountains that is easily accessible to all. The property also features a universally accessible trail system and other recreational trails and complements nearby outdoor recreational resources, including the Northern Forest Canoe Trail and Saddleback Ski Area; Quill Hill is a prominent feature of the view from Saddleback, and vice versa. The Quill Hill property will continue to be owned by the Brochu family with the property available for continued timber harvest and is now permanently protected via a conservation easement held by the State of Maine and the U.S. Navy. The 6,578-acre Perham Stream property was purchased from Bayroot, LLC by the Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands, and there is now a conservation easement on the property held by the U.S. Navy. On the slopes of the 4,802-foot Mt Abraham, the property features a mountainous bowl around Farmer Mountain and two headwater streams in the Kennebec River watershed that provide important cold-water habitat Perham Stream in the Sandy River watershed and Quick Stream in the Carrabassett River watershed. Entirely open to public recreation as part of Maines Public Reserve Lands system, almost 5,000 acres is designated as an addition to the ecological reserve on Mt. Abraham, while the remaining nearly 1,600 acres will be available for timber harvest by the Bureau. Lead funding for the Quill Hill to Perham Stream effort came from the United States Forest Service Forest Legacy Program, with additional support from the U.S. Department of Defense Readiness and Environmental Protection Integration Program, and the generous support of private individuals and foundations including RA Capital, the EJK Foundation, The Betterment Fund, the Appalachian Trail Conservancys Wild East Fund, and the Maine Mountain Collaborative Transaction Fund. \"Im thrilled that future generations will be able to experience the unmatched beauty of the Western Maine mountains from Quill Hill to Perham Stream,\" said Governor Janet Mills. \"This extraordinary, collaborative conservation project will preserve access to some of the most breathtaking vistas in the state and set aside thousands of acres of land for recreation and wildlife habitat that will benefit generations to come. I thank the Trust for Public Land and The Nature Conservancy for partnering with the Bureau of Parks and Land to make this extraordinary achievement possible.\" \"By opening access to the Quill Hill and Perham Stream properties, were helping to link more than 100,000 acres of public lands along the Appalachian National Scenic Trail to mitigate climate impacts and ensure access to the outdoors for all,\" said Betsy Cook, Maine State Program Director for Trust for Public Land. \"This space will be truly open to all, with ADA accessible viewing areas and hiking and outdoor recreational opportunities for every ability level. TPL is proud to work with project partners to protect this incredible landscape.\" \"Conserving Quill Hill to Perham Stream is a critical step forward for Maines climate resilience, and a case study in collaborative conservation,\" said Kate Dempsey, State Director of The Nature Conservancy in Maine. \"Over the past four years, the support and commitment of the private landowners, public agencies, local businesses, over two dozen conservation and economic development organizations, and Maines congressional delegation has been vital to the success of this project.\" \"This collaborative project contains all the key elements that reflect Maine's vision for conservation: a privately owned working forest that supports Maine's timber economy, ecological reserves that sustain biodiversity, and multiple-use public land that will benefit people and wildlife for generations to come,\" said Maine Bureau of Parks and Lands Director Andy Cutko. \"To say that my late husband, Adrian, loved Quill Hill is an understatement,\" said Celine Brochu. \"He thought about Quill all the time. In the winter, he would read every single comment left in the guest books, making his own notes in the margins. He spent long summer days at Quill smoothing rough spots on the road, moving countless rocks, taking breaks to chat with visitors. Quill Hill always held a very special place in his heart. And mine. He often talked about how he wanted Quill Hill to be open and accessible to everyone forever. I am incredibly proud of all he accomplished and so grateful that our family and all the project partners including TPL, TNC, the State of Maine, the U.S. Forest Service, and U.S. Navy, have realized his vision and permanently protected Quill Hill.\" \"The permanent conservation of these lands protects the wilderness environment the Navy relies on for realistic training, preserving wildlife habitat and preventing incompatible development near the base,\" said Capt. Michael Oberdorf, shipyard and installation commander at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. \"We are proud to be part of such a successful effort that supports mission readiness while increasing access to outdoor recreation and advancing the region and Maines climate resiliency and conservation goals.\" \"The state of Maine is blessed with an abundance of natural resources, which offer both its residents and visitors the opportunity to experience and appreciate the pristine environment that surrounds them,\" said Senators Collins and King and Representative Golden. \"It is imperative that we protect these resources, like Quill Hill and Perham Stream, from development and ensure future generations can continue to enjoy and connect with nature across our state.\" \"Our nation's forests provide immeasurable social, economic, and environmental benefits that are lost when forestland is converted to non-forest uses,\" said Gina Owens, Regional Forester for the USDA Forest Service's Eastern Region. \"The Forest Services Forest Legacy Program directly supports our partners in pursuing mutual forest conservation objectives for the benefit of future generations.\" About Trust for Public Land Trust for Public Land (TPL) is a national nonprofit that works to connect everyone to the benefits and joys of the outdoors.

Land Use Planning Commission Studies Short-Term Rentals May 18, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Augusta, ME - The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Land Use Planning Commission (LUPC) is studying short-term rental activity in the Commission's service area and seeking public input on potential regulatory options. Short-term rentals have a deep history in rural Maine. The rise of user-friendly online reservation platforms and evolving traveler preferences have contributed to the growing popularity of short-term rentals in the Commission's service area. While short-term rental activity can bring positive economic effects, it can also create nuisances for neighbors and have environmental impacts. Throughout June and July 2023, the Commission will facilitate in-person community meetings in the Millinocket, Moosehead, and Rangeley regions. Additionally, at least one virtual meeting and a written public comment period will be held. These events aim to gather feedback from community members regarding the positive and negative aspects of this type of rental activity and potential regulatory options. \"We are particularly interested in hearing from community members in these three regions as they have a significant number of short-term rental listings in the Commissions service area. Their insights will help us evaluate, refine, and potentially establish a regulatory approach,\" stated Stacie Beyer, Executive Director of the Land Use Planning Commission. The LUPC's [short-term rental webpage](//www.maine.gov/dacf/lupc/projects/short-term-rentals/)contains materials related to this project. As meeting dates, locations, and times are finalized and informational materials become available, the webpage will be updated. Individuals may sign up for project updates by email, including meeting announcements and reminders, using the blue box located in the upper right-hand corner of the webpage. About the LUPC The Land Use Planning Commission (LUPC) was established by the Maine Legislature to extend the principles of sound planning, zoning, and development to the unorganized and deorganized areas of the State, including townships and plantations. These areas either lack local government or have chosen not to administer land use controls at the local level. For more information, please visit the [LUPC webpage](//www.maine.gov/dacf/lupc/).

These destructive pests and diseases significantly threaten Maine's landscapes, trees, agriculture, forests, wildlife, and overall environment. As Maine begins vacation and camping season, a key concern must be highlighted: the emergence of adult [emerald ash borers](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab/index.shtml)from ash trees during summer. These invasive beetles, which destroy trees, can easily spread to new locations through contaminated firewood carried by vacationers and campers. Although invisible to the naked eye, invasive species can reside within firewood and unknowingly be transported over long distances. Once introduced, these pests and diseases have the potential to devastate our ornamental trees and forest habitats and impact fish, wildlife, and property values, resulting in substantial management costs. It is important to recognize that even seemingly unblemished and pristine wood can harbor infestations and contribute to the spread of tree-killing pests and diseases. Therefore, immediate action is crucial to prevent the further proliferation of invasive species. DACF advises everyone to: Recognize the threat: Firewood that has not been treated and is transported over distances greater than 10 miles poses a significant risk to our trees and forests. Source firewood locally: While enjoying your time camping or heading up to camp in Maine, prioritize obtaining affordable, locally sourced firewood or explore heat-treated options from reputable in-state vendors. Visit the [Firewood Scout website](//www.firewoodscout.org/)to locate local firewood suppliers. As part of its commitment to safeguarding Maine's natural resources, DACF has implemented plant pest quarantines to limit the movement of specific plant materials. However, every individual must play their part in halting or slowing down the spread of invasive species. Learn more about ongoing [forestry-related quarantines and invasive threats](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/quarantine_information.html). Together, let's protect Maine's fish and wildlife and preserve our forest heritage for future generations.

Embrace Safety and Fun at Maine State Park Beaches May 25, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) National Beach Safety Week Augusta - The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) is joining National Beach Safety Week's spirit in promoting beach safety and spreading the word to ensure a fantastic Memorial Day Weekend. With Memorial Day Weekend upon us, as we prepare to enjoy the sun, sand, and waves on Maine State Park beaches, it is time to prioritize safety while creating lasting memories. Under the theme of \"Sun, Surf, and Safety,\" National Beach Safety Week serves as a crucial reminder to take necessary precautions while enjoying the beaches. The campaign aims to educate beachgoers about the importance of beach safety, equip them with essential knowledge, and foster a sense of community among beach enthusiasts. The DACF's Bureau of Parks and Lands encourages everyone to follow these essential tips for a safe and enjoyable beach experience: Take a Dip with Care: Prioritize your safety by familiarizing yourself with the water conditions, rip currents, and warning flags. Never underestimate the power of the ocean! Shield Yourself from the Sun: Protect yourself from harmful UV rays by applying sunscreen generously, wearing a wide-brimmed hat, and seeking shade during the hottest parts of the day. Respect the Environment: Our beaches are not only our playgrounds but also home to diverse ecosystems and wildlife. Let's be sound stewards of these environments by disposing of trash responsibly, staying on designated paths, avoiding disturbing [wildlife](//www.maine.gov/ifw/fish-wildlife/wildlife/endangered-threatened-species/essential-wildlife-habitat/pplt-nests.html), and being [shark smart](//www.maine.gov/dacf/parks/safety/index.shtml#sharksmart). Watch Out for Each Other: We are all part of the beach community, and looking out for one another is paramount. Keep an eye on your family, friends, and fellow beachgoers. If you spot someone struggling in the water, immediately alert a lifeguard or park staff, or dial 911. Be Prepared: Safety is all about being prepared. Pack a beach bag with essentials such as water, snacks, a first aid kit, and emergency contact information. Note: Please be aware that Maine State Park beaches may have limited staff, and all state park beaches will be without lifeguards until the third week of June. Additionally, sand erosion is impacting Popham Beach State Park at high tide. It is crucial to follow staff instructions to avoid risks or hazards. Your cooperation and adherence to their guidance are greatly appreciated. Let's make this Memorial Day Weekend one to remember, filled with joy, laughter, and, most importantly, beach safety! Join the National Beach Safety Week nationwide movement and spread the word using the hashtags #BeachSafetyWeek, #MemorialDayWeekend, and #FunInTheSun. Preserve Maine's Forests: Choose Local Heat-Treated Firewood! May 26, 2023 For more information contact: Kent Nelson at: [Kent.Nelson@maine.gov](mailto:Kent.Nelson@maine.gov)(207) 650-0280 Augusta, ME - The Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) urges Mainers and visitors to prioritize using local or heat-treated firewood. It's not just a smart decision; it's also a legal requirement, as there are stringent restrictions on the movement of certain firewood. Remember, untreated firewood from out-of-state is banned ( [maine.gov/firewood](//www.maine.gov/firewood)), and transporting hardwood firewood from within specific quarantine areas is strictly prohibited ( [maine.gov/eab](//www.maine.gov/eab)). When moving firewood, people often overlook the potential risks, assuming it is harmless or the cost of wood is too high at their destination. However, they unknowingly carry destructive insects and diseases that can have far more significant consequences. Once introduced, these pests and diseases have the potential to devastate our ornamental trees and forest habitats and impact fish, wildlife, and property values, resulting in substantial management costs. Whether for campfires or warmth during cool evenings, it is vital to obtain firewood from a local source (ideally within 10 miles) or opt for heat-treated wood. The truth is firewood from distant locations has been responsible for introducing the Asian longhorned beetle, emerald ash borer, oak wilt, southern pine beetle, brown spruce long-horned beetle, and numerous other forest destroying pests to new areas. Find treated or local firewood sources conveniently through the [Firewood Scout website](//www.firewoodscout.org/s/ME/). - What: Protect Maine's Forests: Out-of-state firewood inspections - When: Maine Forest Rangers and other officials will be stationed at key locations starting Memorial Day weekend to enforce Maine's ban on imported firewood. This ban is crucial in mitigating the significant risk posed by untreated firewood carrying destructive insects. - Why: Inspecting firewood carried by vehicles registered outside of Maine is critical to slow the spread of invasive species. Rangers and other officials will engage with people to raise awareness about invasive pest threats, provide information, and answer questions. Additionally, they will enhance their presence at prominent private and public campgrounds and other key locations. Let's unite to protect Maine's invaluable forests by using local or heat-treated firewood. Comply with the ban on imported firewood and follow best management practices and regulations on movement of firewood originating in the [emerald ash borer quarantine area](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mfs/forest_health/invasive_threats/eab/index.shtml). Together, we can preserve the natural beauty and ecological balance that defines our beloved state.

Supporting documents PFAS Fund Advisory Committee Approves Plan for Administration of the Fund to Address PFAS Contamination July 11, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov)(207) 480-0558 Augusta, ME - The Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry (DACF) announced today that the [PFAS Fund Advisory Committee](//www.maine.gov/dacf/about/commissioners/pfasfund/advisory-committee.shtml)unanimously approved the Plan for Administration of the Fund to Address PFAS Contamination. This represents a crucial step in assisting Maine farms impacted by PFAS contamination and reaffirms Maine's commitment to protecting human health and maintaining farm viability. The PFAS Fund will expand upon existing support extended to impacted farmers through the Bureau of Agriculture, Food and Rural Resources. It will provide critical aid to Maine farms grappling with PFAS contamination, working to revitalize their operations while also reinforcing the state's steadfast commitment to the welfare of its citizens and the longevity of its agricultural sector. \"Today marks a significant milestone in Maine's effort to combat PFAS contamination. The PFAS Fund Advisory Committee has approved a well-informed plan for the Fund's administration, which represents hundreds of hours of time invested by farmers, finance and business experts, researchers, healthcare professionals, legislators, and many others to activate critical resources to address this pressing issue,\" said DACF Commissioner Amanda Beal. \"Together, we are determined to safeguard our agricultural landscapes and protect our communities from the harmful effects of PFAS.\" Governor Mills' establishment of the [PFAS Task Force](//www.maine.gov/pfastaskforce/materials/report/PFAS-Task-Force-Report-FINAL-Jan2020.pdf)in 2019 marked the State of Maine's start to proactively addressing PFAS contamination. With bipartisan support and significant resources allocated by the Legislature, the State has since implemented a first-of-its-kind, cross-agency response effort to identify the extent of PFAS contamination and provide financial and other support to impacted communities. DACF works directly with impacted farmers, offering guidance and resources to navigate the uncertainties associated with PFAS contamination. The PFAS Fund is the latest initiative to provide comprehensive assistance to commercial farmers and individuals affected by PFAS. The PFAS Fund will be crucial in augmenting existing DACF financial assistance to support commercial farms throughout the investigation and implementation of recovery strategies. It will, for example, provide income replacement payments, cover the costs of necessary infrastructure upgrades, and support \"navigators\" who will offer guidance to producers on how to obtain assistance and services. In cases where the extent of contamination is impossible to overcome, the PFAS Fund can purchase PFAS-impacted property at fair market value as if there was no PFAS contamination. Research is also a cornerstone of the PFAS Fund, which will launch a competitive research grant program to fund studies that help farmers determine the best options for maintaining and enhancing viability despite the presence of PFAS. It will also seek to establish a dedicated research station on one of the purchased parcels of land. Addressing the health concerns of affected individuals is a critical aspect of the PFAS Fund. It will support access to healthcare for impacted commercial farm families, farm workers, and residents whose drinking water wells were contaminated by PFAS because of the land application of biosolids. The Fund proposes covering costs not otherwise covered by insurance for blood testing, mental health care, and medical monitoring. Additionally, it will support a clinical trial for PFAS body burden reduction treatments and a study to determine routes and magnitude of soil-related PFAS exposure. DACF was required to develop an implementation plan before using the funds. The PFAS Fund advisory committee and its four subcommittees collectively met 30 times in six months to craft, review, and approve this Plan and its 23 specific strategic recommendations. PFAS Fund Director Beth Valentine oversaw the process, including two public hearings to review and discuss the Fund and proposals. DACF appreciates the dedication and hard work of [all committee and subcommittee members](//www.maine.gov/dacf/about/news/news.shtml?id=9145129), as well as of co-chairs Senator Stacy Brenner and Representative Jessica Fay. The DACF acknowledges that the discovery of PFAS on a commercial farm is devastating. However, with the support of existing programs and the additional assistance provided by the PFAS Fund, Maine will continue to lead the nation in helping commercial farmers overcome the challenges presented by PFAS contamination.

Maine Offers Free Collection of Unwanted Pesticides to Protect Natural Resources August 3, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Augusta, MAINE - Maine residents can participate in the Obsolete Pesticide Collection Program, a joint initiative by the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry's Board of Pesticides Control (BPC) and the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. The program aims to safeguard Maine's natural resources and prevent agricultural pollution by promoting the safe and proper disposal of outdated, unused, or unwanted pesticides. Homeowners and family-owned farms are encouraged to take advantage of this opportunity by bringing their unwanted pesticides, including herbicides, insecticides, rodenticides, fungicides, disinfectants, and similar products used in agricultural production or around the home, to collection sites in Presque Isle, Bangor, Augusta, and Portland. Key Information - The next obsolete pesticide collection days will be held during October 2023, with one-day events in Presque Isle, Bangor, Augusta, and Portland. - Pre-registration is required by September 29 to participate; drop-ins are not permitted. - The program only accepts pesticides and spray adjuvants. - Registration instructions and forms can be found on the program webpage: [thinkfirstspraylast.org](//www.thinkfirstspraylast.org). - Each registration must be from the person currently possessing the pesticides, and materials collected on behalf of others will not be accepted. More details, including drop-off locations and the obsolete pesticides inventory form, will be provided soon on the BPC website at [thinkfirstspraylast.org](//www.thinkfirstspraylast.org). About Maine's Obsolete Pesticide Collection Program Removing obsolete and unwanted pesticides is essential for protecting public health, wildlife, and the environment. Improper handling and disposal of pesticides can contaminate land and water resources. The Maine Obsolete Pesticide Collection Program ensures these hazardous materials are handled and disposed of safely. Since its inception in 1982, the program has successfully diverted over 250,000 lbs. of pesticides from entering the waste stream. Collected pesticides are transported to licensed, out-of-state disposal facilities through a hazardous waste disposal contractor. Disposing of Pesticides Safely Always follow the label instructions for the proper use, storage, and disposal of any pesticides you use.

Supporting documents First Occurrence of Mile-a-Minute Weed Confirmed in Maine, Urgent Action Required August 8, 2023 For more information contact: Jim Britt at: [Jim.Britt@maine.gov](mailto:Jim.Britt@maine.gov) Augusta, Maine - The Department of Agriculture Conservation and Forestry (DACF) has recently verified the first known occurrence of mile-a-minute weed (Persicaria perfoliata) in Maine. This fast-growing invasive vine, native to India, Asia, and the Philippine Islands, poses a significant threat to nurseries, Christmas tree farms, reforestation projects, and restoration areas, as it can smother young plants and trees under its dense growth. The discovery was made at a private residence in Boothbay Harbor, where the alert landowner reported finding a mile-a-minute weed plant while cleaning up weeds that came with newly installed landscape plants. This invasive species is one of 33 plants listed on the DACF's [do-not-sell list](//www.maine.gov/dacf/php/horticulture/invasiveplants.shtml), notorious for hitchhiking on nursery stock and spreading rapidly. Mile-a-minute weed derives its name from its astonishing growth rate of up to 6 inches per day or 25 feet in six to eight weeks. It features distinctive triangular leaves, spikes of pea-sized blue fruits, and recurved barbs along the stems and leaf margins. The vine also displays peculiar circular leaves, known as ocreae, clasping the stem beneath each fruit spike. Invasive species like mile-a-minute weed have the potential to cause severe harm to Maine's environment and economy. As part of our commitment to controlling and eradicating this invasive plant, the DACF urges the public to report any potential sightings promptly. If you encounter a vine resembling mile-a-minute weed, please visit the [Maine Natural Areas webpage](//www.maine.gov/dacf/mnap/features/invasive_plants/invsheets.htm)for identification information.
