Chandra Krishnamurthy, the Vice Chancellor at Pondicherry University, has been \"placed under 'compulsory wait' by the Union human resource ministry following several charges against her,\" according to The Times of India. In 2011, a Nigerian journal published an essay entitled \"What Makes a Journal Great\" by its newly appointed editor, outlining his editorial philosophy \u2014 a philosophy that apparently includes lifting text from another source. Earlier this year, Food and Nutrition Sciences retracted two papers from an author who criticized highly popular fish oil supplements after an additional round of peer review concluded his papers present a \"biased interpretation,\" among other issues. Last year, Brian Peskin lost a paper for an \"undeclared competing interest\" \u2014 namely, that he held patents and directed a company associated with essential fatty acids. Biotechnology Letters has retracted a paper on a new gene delivery technique due to \"the deliberate and fraudulent use of data in the paper that had previously appeared in other papers of these two authors.\" The journal's Editor in Chief Colin Ratledge told us that someone tipped him off that one of the authors, University of Kalyani microbiologist Keka Sarkar, had been self-plagiarizing: I can say that a person who was familiar with the work of Dr Sarkar got in touch with about their concerns about her publications and, in particular, her paper published in Biotechnology Letters. They supplied a dossier of her publications showing the obvious duplications of figures and that she had been using the same figures in different papers to illustrate the results from supposedly different experiments. Expert Opinion on Therapeutic Patents has retracted a 2015 review article about natural fighters of cancer stem cells for reproducing \"content to a high degree of similarity without appropriate attribution or acknowledgement\" from a handful of papers. The authors of a 2015 paper about non-native spider populations in Chile are retracting it from the Journal of Arachnology because they copied the introduction of a 2011 paper verbatim. The retraction was triggered by the first author, who \"insisted on a full retraction in lieu of milder remedies,\" according to the journal's editor-in-chief. The paper, in Chile: evaluating Darwin's naturalization hypothesis,\" tested Darwin's hypothesis that introduced species that are phylogenetically distant from native animals are more likely to thrive. It was published in April. Authors Andr\u00e9s Taucare-R\u00edos and Ramiro O. Bustamante are both based at the University of Chile in Santiago. "}
