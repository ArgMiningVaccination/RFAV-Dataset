We detailed this commitment in our OneNYC report. Since that time, the nations of the world have come together to agree on a ground- breaking Paris Agreement, and just this month the world's two biggest emitters, the US and China, committed to joining that agreement, putting it on a path toward ratification. Locally, we have continued to drive down our emissions, but we have much more to do. OneNYC makes clear how much progress has been made toward ensuring that New York City is the most sustainable big city in the world. Our air is cleaner, our streets are greener, and we are sending less waste to landfills. Achieving 80 x 50 will require even more dramatic action, across all of New York City's buildings, infrastructure, parks, and open spaces. That's why we have committed billions of dollars for energy efficiency measures in our own municipal buildings, ramped up the purchase of electric vehicles for our fleet, and dramatically expanded the use of solar power across the city. In each case, we are seeking to use our own purchasing power to transform the marketplace and create demand for the technology we know will be necessary to achieve 80 x 50. Today, we are taking the next steps on this pathway to achieve 80 x 50. This roadmap includes world-leading analysis of our city's emissions, an analysis of difficult choices we have to make to drive down our emissions, and the types of actions that will be required to transform how we use energy in every part of our lives. This report lays out a platform for action\u2014one that can guide our actions now and into the future. Over the next several years, we will be doing more to build on these successes\u2014including expanding initiatives that provide more just environmental outcomes for all New Yorkers\u2014to reach our goals of a greener, more sustainable city. Anything less would be unacceptable. Continuing to deliver on these commitments will require nothing less than bold, innovative solutions and strong partnerships\u2014and New York City will be a model to inspire other cities around the world to do the same. Everyday, our work only grows to build an even stronger, more sustainable, more resilient, and more equitable city\u2014 OneNYC . Mayor Bill de Blasio 4 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50Executive Summary 5 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50Climate change is an existential threat to our city, our country, and our planet. With the signing of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, 195 nations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, agreed to limit global temperature increase to no more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The Agreement also recognizes the need to curb warming even further, and urges nations to increase efforts to limit global temperature increase to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. To reach these ambitious but necessary targets, developed countries will have to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the harmful gases that are the cause of global climate change, by at least 80 percent by 2050 (80 x 50). In September 2014, New York City committed itself to 80 x 50, with an interim target to reduce GHG emissions 40 percent by 2030 (40 x 30), and took immediate steps to achieve that goal. We committed billions of dollars to reduce our own carbon footprint with investments in energy efficiency for municipal buildings. We followed that up with the release of One New Y ork: the Plan for A Strong and Just City (OneNYC ) in April 2015, laying the blueprint for inclusive climate action that works for all New Yorkers across four key visions of Growth, Equity, Sustainability, and Resiliency. In OneNYC , we expanded our commitment to 80 x 50 with new investments in re - newable energy, electric vehicles, and solid waste man - agement that are improving air quality across the city and catalyzing an important shift away from fossil fu - el-based sources of energy. With New Y ork City's Road - map to 80 x 50 the City is laying out a comprehensive report, based on the best available science and state-of- the-art GHG emissions modeling, to assess what will be necessary to reach 80 x 50, and to promote economic opportunities that come from the investments that will be required.Expected T emperatur e Incr eases in NYC thr ough the End of the Century Temperatur e - Mean Annual Changes Baseline (1971-2000) 54\u00b0F High/Low2020s 2050s 2080s 2100 Middle The low estimate (10th percentile), middle range (25th percentile to 75th percentile), and 3.8\u00b0 21005.8-10.3\u00b012.1\u00b0 4.2\u00b0Expected Temperature Increases in NYC through the End of the Century Temperature - Mean Annual Changes Baseline (1971 - 2000) 54\u00b0F6 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50 1One City Built to Last The City of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio Mayor's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability Anthony Shorris, First Deputy Mayor The Cit y of New York NYC Mayor's Office a greener, greater New YOrkNew YOrk CITY's PaThwaYs TO DeeP CarbON reDUCTIONs DECEMBER 2013 The City of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio Anthony Shorris First Deputy MayorOne New Yor k The Plan for a Strong and Just City December 2013 PlaNYC: New York City's Pathways to Deep Carbon Reductions, Evaluation of the technical potential of 80 x 50September 2014 One City Built to Last, 10-year plan to reduce emissions from NYC buildingsApril 2015 One New York: The Plan for a Strong and Just City, NYC's comprehensive plan for a strong, sustainable, resilient, and equitable city February 2015 Buildings Technical Working Group kickoffNYC committed to 80 x 50The Roadmap to 80 x 50 We now know what it takes to achieve 80 x 50. The City must accelerate efforts to make buildings and vehicles significantly more energy efficient, replace many fossil fuel-based heating and hot water systems in buildings with renewable or high efficiency electric systems, tran - sition towards a renewables-based electric grid, signifi - cantly reduce the number of miles driven while tran - sitioning remaining vehicle trips to electric and clean fuel vehicles, and achieve the goal of Zero Waste to landfills. The technologies necessary to shift away from fossil fuels and reduce waste-related emissions exist to - day. However, bold action is necessary from all levels of government and the private sector to make the invest - ments, develop new regulatory frameworks, and drive institutional and societal changes necessary to achieve 80 x 50. Benefits of 80 x 50 for all New Yorkers On the path to 80 x 50, the city will take major steps that can improve the quality of life for New Yorkers and develop new industries that have significant potential for new job creation. Retrofits to buildings will improve the quality of housing, and the energy efficiency gained will help to keep homes affordable over the long-term. Shifts towards transportation options that are clean - er and multi-modal will improve air quality and public health outcomes in our communities, while also provid - ing access to more transportation options to New York - ers that currently lack them. An expansion of renewable energy across the city will provide communities with more choice, and will enhance the resiliency of critical services in neighborhoods that are currently vulnerable to outages and weather impacts. In the end, we know that this path is necessary and comes with a moral im - perative that we pass on a stronger and more just world to the next generation.7 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50 The City of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio Anthony Shorris First Deputy MayorOneNYC 2016 Progress Report One City Built to Last Technical Working Group Report TRANSFORMING NEW YORK CITY BUILDINGS FOR A LOW-CARBON FUTURE The City of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio Mayor's Of ce of SustainabilityThe City of New YorkMayor Bill de Blasio Mayor's Of ce of Sustainability April 2016 OneNYC 2016 Progress Report, NYC's progress in delivering on the OneNYC commitments One City: Built to Last, Technical Working Group Report, Comprehensive analysis of energy use in NYC's buildings and next steps to place buildings on a pathway to 80 x 50 September 2016 New York City's Roadmap to 80 x 50 January 2016 Energy, Transportation, and Waste sectors begin 80 x 50 planningNew York City already has one of the lowest levels of GHG emissions per resident among major national and global cities. In fact, the city's GHG emissions per capita are just one-third the U.S. average. In 2007, New York City committed to a first-ever goal of reducing green - house gas emissions 30 percent by 2030. Since that time, the threat of climate change has intensified; rising sea levels, increasing temperatures and precipitation, and the likelihood of more frequent and intense storms that leave our neighborhoods and infrastructure more vulnerable, while exacerbating many underlying social and economic inequalities. That is why we committed ourselves to enacting policies that achieve even deeper reductions in GHG emissions. We are already on the path to 40 x 30 With the commitments in OneNYC and related efforts, the City is already implementing policies and programs that will significantly reduce GHG emissions. These ini -tiatives, once fully realized, along with existing state and federal level policies and market trends, put us on track to achieve an interim target of a 40 percent reduction by 2030 (40 x 30). The City's analysis shows that the projected impact of these efforts will make it possible to bend the curve on GHG emissions. Our analysis also shows, however, that these efforts alone are not enough to reach 80 x 50. We must continue to do more to reduce emissions in New York City and lead progress across the globe if we are all to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. In each sector\u2014buildings, energy, transportation, and waste\u2014the City has made progress toward 40 x 30, put - ting us on the trajectory necessary for 80 x 50. New Y ork City's Roadmap to 80 x 50 analysis has shown a feasible potential pathway to build on this progress with an inte - grated set of strategies to achieve 80 x 50. 8 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50progress reflects the City's commitment to become an even friendlier market for solar power, invest in solar on our own buildings, and facilitate the adoption of sys - tems on private property through group purchasing and community-shared solar PV projects. Buildings More than 68 percent of citywide GHG emissions can be attributed to the energy used to power, heat, and cool buildings\u2014which includes the emissions from burning fossil fuels to generate electricity. While our city's popu - lation and economy grew, citywide GHG emissions were reduced largely due to reductions in GHG emissions from the electricity supply, the conversion from heav - ing heating oils to cleaner fuels in buildings and mod - est improvements in energy efficiency. The majority of GHG emissions in buildings are from the use of natural gas and oil for heat and hot water, followed by use of electricity from the central grid. The City is currently leading by example to reduce GHG emissions from municipal buildings and are on track to achieve a 35 percent reduction in our own City build - ings by 2025. The City is retrofitting every City-owned building to reduce energy consumption and installing 100 MW of solar energy on these properties. Beginning in 2017, all new City-owned properties will be designed to consume at least 50 percent less energy than current standards. The City has implemented policies to encourage or re - quire private building owners and decision-makers to invest in energy efficiency and switch to cleaner sources of energy. The City's efforts help ensure building owners and decision-makers have access to their energy use in - formation and require improvements to the energy per - formance in New York City's largest buildings. To date, these policies have helped large buildings that consis - tently benchmark achieve an eight percent reduction in GHG emissions. The City also phased out the use of No. 6 fuel oil. Nearly 6,000 buildings have converted to cleaner fuels, many with assistance provided through the City's NYC Clean Heat program. As these buildings have switched to a cleaner burning fuel, New York City's air quality has im - proved,preventing approximately 210 premature deaths and 540 hospitalizations annually. Neighborhoods with the highest density of boiler conversions\u2014such as northern Manhattan, northern Queens, and the South Bronx\u2014saw the greatest improvement in air quality, Energy The biggest driver of GHG emission reductions in New York City, to date, has been changes to our electricity supply. Since 2005, the baseline year for our GHG ac - counting, New York City's electric grid has become cleaner due a switch in power plant fuel sources from oil and coal to natural gas, which emits fewer GHG emissions when burned, as well as an increase in the efficiency of operations and the construction of new, highly efficient power plants. Efforts at the state level, most notably the Clean Energy Standard's mandate that New York's utilities meet 50 percent of electricity con - sumption with renewable energy by 2030, are expected to further reduce the carbon intensity of the grid. The City is also making great progress increasing local renewable electricity generation through solar pho - tovoltaic (PV) installations. Since 2014 alone, citywide solar energy installations have nearly quadrupled.

The City launched multiple new or expanded pro - grams as part of its One City: Built to Last plan, which include the NYC Retrofit Accelerator, Community Ret - rofit NYC, the NYC Benchmarking Help Center, and the NYC Carbon Challenge. Together, these programs are working with owners and decision-makers of nearly 4,000 properties, representing almost ten percent of the built square footage across New York City, to undertake energy efficiency projects and improve operations and maintenance. The associated reductions in utility of op - erational costs is helping, in part, to keep residential and commercial spaces affordable. The City has continuously updated its local building codes to include more stringent energy efficiency and sustainability requirements, most recently with its 2016 update to the New York City Energy Conservation Code. The update will lead to an eight and a half percent re - duction in energy use in new commercial buildings and a 25 percent reduction in new residential buildings. Transportation New York is home to the most extensive public trans - portation system in the country, and with it the highest percentage of public transit commuters. Still, over 90 percent of transportation-related GHG emissions come from on-road vehicles, and a majority of these emissions come from personal vehicles. The City has been working to make more sustain - able modes of transportation (public transportation, bicycling, and walking) more accessible options for New Yorkers to get around the city. The City has part - nered with New York State to increase bus speed levels through the Select Bus Service and support the expan - sion of the transit system. This includes investments into the second phase of the Second Avenue Subway, the Penn Station Access project to bring Metro North trains into Penn Station, and the expansion of commu - nications-based train control, to enable more frequent subway service. The City has also been working to make walking and bicycling safer and more enjoyable, pursu - ing investments in pedestrian plazas and enforcement efforts outlined in Vision Zero to make our streets safer for pedestrians. The City also continues to expand the citywide protected bike lane network and other bicy - cling infrastructure to double the number of cyclists by 2020. Together these efforts are helping more New Yorkers choose more sustainable transportation options over single-occupancy vehicles to move around the city. The City is helping to spur the market for electric vehi - cles and the use of renewable fuels for those trips that require vehicles. With the launch of the NYC Clean Fleet initiative, New York City set out to create the larg - est electric vehicle fleet of any U.S. city to date and re - duce on-road emissions. The City has purchased over 500 electric vehicles since the program launched in De - cember 2015. The City has furthered this commitment to a more sus - tainable transportation sector with the release of the New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) Strategic Plan 2016: Safe\u00b7Green\u00b7Smart\u00b7Equitable . The strategic plan articulates how DOT will improve traffic safety and public health; expand travel choices for all New Yorkers; encourage New Yorkers to shift to lower carbon modes of transportation, including walking, bik - ing and public transit; and maintain streets and bridges in a state of good repair. Greater use of technology will support data-driven parking and freight management programs. Waste Methane emissions from landfilled waste\u2014especially from food and other organic material\u2014and the process - ing of wastewater at the city's 14 wastewater treatment plants are responsible for four percent of citywide GHG emissions. As a leader on waste reduction initiatives, New York City is one of the largest cities in the world to make a commitment to Zero Waste. The City committed to meeting Zero Waste through a unique combination of waste reduction, reuse, and recycling programs and Community Retrofit NYC launch event Photo credit: NYC Mayor's Office10 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50diversion of organic waste from landfills to wastewater treatment plants for digestion and beneficial reuse. All of which reduce GHG emissions. The City's Zero Waste program relies far less on conventional waste-to-ener - gy processing, and instead emphasizes highest and best use of commodities and materials in the waste stream. To date, the City has expanded curbside organics collec - tion to more than 700,000 New Yorkers, launched the NYCHA recycling program in more than 1,600 public housing buildings, updated city regulations to make it easier for businesses to recycle, and through our pub - lic engagement program, GreeNYC, empowered New Yorkers to opt out of unwanted mail and reduce waste from single-use shopping bags, coffee cups, and water bottles. Our groundbreaking methodology and strategies to achieve 80 x 50 New Y ork City's Roadmap to 80 x 50 builds on the ini - tiatives launched by the City to date as well as analy - sis done for the Pathways to Deep Carbon Reductions report, published by the Bloomberg administration in 2013. We know achieving 80 x 50 in New York City is feasible using existing technologies and strategies, al - though it will require significant social, economic, and regulatory changes. A key challenge will be moving away from our current dependency on fossil fuels to the greatest extent possible, which currently provide us with the vast majority of energy we use for power, heat, cooling, and mobility. The City conducted an in-depth, integrated analysis to understand potential strategies to make this transition and achieve 80 x 50 in New York City. The study found that the 80 x 50 roadmap requires an integrated ap - proach looking across sectors\u2014buildings, energy, trans -portation and waste. It also requires actions to reduce GHG emissions at the individual, buildings, community, city, and regional levels. The benefits to New Yorkers are real: strategies to reduce the carbon intensity of the electric grid reduce emissions from vehicles and build - ings and improve air quality; small-scale and on-site energy sources can improve the efficiency of buildings and reduce the likelihood of power outages to enhance resiliency; and the latent energy available from solid waste and wastewater can be used as a renewable energy source and this use mitigates the exposure to methane, and other pollutants. These strategies also advance the cause of social and environmental consiterations that are key components of the administration's equity agenda. When fully im - plemented, the results will be improved air quality and associated health outcomes in vulnerable communities; the emergence of new jobs and industries, as well as training programs to ensure that New Yorkers are pre - pared to fill these positions; and more affordable energy for residents and startup businesses alike. Equity and environmental conditions are inexorably linked, and this plan considers the environmental impediments to Curbside organics collection Photo credit: NYC Department of Sanitation Designated electric vehicle parking spaces Photo credit: NYC Department of Citywide Administrative Services 11 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50economic opportunity, as well as disparities in health outcomes related to environmental hazards. The City's analysis shows that we must continue to must move forward aggressively on all fronts to achieve 80 x 50. A renewables-based electric grid alone will not be sufficient to reach this goal, and neither will building retrofits alone. We need to pursue both, along with pro - moting distributed renewable community-scale electric, heating, and cooling networks; reductions in the num - ber of miles people drive; a shift to electric vehicles and renewable fuels for remaining automobiles; and achievement of Zero Waste and net-zero energy at in- city wastewater treatment plants. The City will use this analysis as a springboard to engage in an on-going implementation process that takes into account experience from existing, new, and future cli - mate initiatives; the state of evolving technologies; and updated climate projections. The City is already taking numerous steps to reduce both municipal and citywide emissions, but there is plenty more that we New Yorkers need to and can do together. We will have to transform New York City to achieve 80 x 50 Incremental steps can reduce emissions, but the level of reduction necessary for 80 x 50 requires transform - ing the financial, operational, and regulatory systems on which New York City depends. We know technolog - ically this is feasible; turning this vision into a reality is a matter of guiding the essential social, economic, and regulatory changes. The strategies laid out in this this report, and the ac - tions that will follow, are the product of a leading-edge analysis that covers critical sectors with an integrated approach. Reaching 80 x 50 is contingent on techno - logical innovation, strong political will, and social and behavioral changes on multiple scales. At the same time, this research has illuminated the path to 80 x 50 in specific and actionable ways. While the responsibilities are dispersed among different levels of government, the private sector, and individual households, we must act together and lead the world by example. Our city, and indeed our planet, requires nothing less. 59.2 -12% -2% -20% -46% 11.8 Citywide 80x50 Target *All percent reductions are relative to the 2005 citywide baselineA ROADMAP TO 80X50 Transporta tionWaste Build ings Energy Supply 2005 Baseline2014 Waste Transportation Buildings 2050 Pre-2014 Policies One City Built to Last Policies TWG ECMs Performance-based Energy Code Deep Energy Retrots, including high efciency electric technilogies for heat and hot water Low Carbon Intensity Electric Grid Pre-2014 Policies Shift away from Personal Vehicles Low Carbon Fuels and Vehicles Improved Network Efciency Improved Freight Efciency Low Carbon Intensity Electric Grid Pre-2014 Policies Zero Waste Net Zero WWTPA Roadmap to 80 x 50, in Million Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO 2e)12 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50Strategy Matrix Energy Buildings Transportation Waste Increase direct and indirect investments in large-scale renewable energy and energy storage Increase efficiency and emissions requirements for in-city generators Make an unprecedented commitment to promote clean, distributed energy resources Implement cost-effective upgrades in existing build - ings to improve energy efficiency in the near-term Scale up deep energy retrofits that holistically ad - dress heating systems, cooling systems, and building envelopes and transition buildings away from fossil fuels Expand distributed solar energy and install 1,000 MW of solar capacity by 2030 Ensure building decision-makers have access to building energy use information Provide assistance to the private sector to accelerate adoption of energy efficiency and clean energy Streamline regulatory processes for building energy efficiency and clean energy Ensure building owners can finance energy efficiency projects Achieve exceptional energy performance for new buildings and substantial renovations Lead by example in City-owned buildings Prepare New York City's workforce to deliver high performance buildings Position New York City as a global hub for energy efficiency and clean energy technologyEnergy Buildings13 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50Energy Buildings Transportation Waste Modernize, expand, and reduce crowding on the city's transit system Make walking and biking safer, more convenient options for all New Yorkers Ensure that the City's policies prioritize walking, biking, and transit Leverage technology and data to expand travel options and optimize the transportation network Better manage and price parking to encourage efficient travel choices Support new mobility options that reduce GHG emissions and prepare for autonomous vehicles Accelerate purchases of zero-emission vehicles Encourage the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels where electric vehicles are not an option Encourage increased efficiency of local and \"last- mile\" freight delivery Invest in rail, maritime, and other infrastructure to increase the efficiency of freight movement Engage all New Yorkers in reducing waste disposal to landfills Minimize waste generated by all City agencies Launch outreach campaigns to reduce food waste Implement proven incentive-based systems to mini - mize waste generation Support increasing citywide reuse and donation Accelerate diversion of recyclable materials from landfills Capture organics and ensure sufficient capacity to facilitate beneficial reuse in both the residential and commercial sectors Expand energy recovery from wastewater processing operations Reduce emissions from the collection and disposal of commercial wasteTransportation Waste14 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50Introduction 15 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50Our Commitment to 80 x 50 In September 2014, New York City committed to achiev - ing an 80 percent reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from 2005 levels by 2050 (80 x 50), joining the world's leading cities in doing our part to reduce our contributions to catastrophic climate change. This will require nothing less than a transformative shift in how energy is used across the city and across the globe, with fossil fuels replaced by clean and renewable sources of energy. The feasibility of 80 x 50 was initially evaluat - ed in New York City's Pathways to Deep Carbon Reduc - tions report ( Pathways , released December 2013 by the Bloomberg administration). In One New Y ork: The Plan for a Strong and Just City (OneNYC ), the City set out to expand upon that work to make New York City the most sustainable big city in the world and a global leader in the fight against climate change. With OneNYC , the City committed to develop an 80 x 50 roadmap to serve as a long-term guide in this ambitious effort. In Pathways, the City found that 80 x 50 is technically feasible. The modeling and analysis for New Y ork City's Roadmap to 80 x 50 creates a roadmap to achieve this target. The City conducted sophisticated analysis and and integrated modeling across the four sectors respon - sible for New York City's GHG emissions\u2014energy sup - ply, buildings, transportation, and waste\u2014to evaluate a number of 2050 scenarios. Our analysis helped us understand how far existing and new regulations, in - vestments, and commitments will get New York City to - wards 80 x 50 and the set of feasible strategies the City, its governmental partners, and the private sector must pursue to fill the remaining gap. The analysis summarized in this report reflects chang - es that have occurred since Pathways , including new regulations, advances in commercially available tech - nologies, and evolving market opportunities that im - pact adoption of GHG reduction strategies. New reg - ulations include New York State policies to reduce the electricity grid's carbon intensity\u2014the amount of car - bon dioxide equivalent per unit of energy. This includes the New York State Clean Energy Standard, adopted in 2016, which mandates that 50 percent of New York State's electricity must come from renewables by 2030. Similarly, the analysis incorporates new standards from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Na - tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration to reduce emissions and improve fuel efficiency for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, which will encourage the devel -opment of new cost-effective technologies that reduce emissions from these vehicles. Additionally, since Path - ways , the City has released a number of new initiatives that will increase the pace of GHG reductions in the city. In addition to regulatory changes, over the past three years we have seen technological advancements, emerg - ing financial tools, incentives, and declining costs that together have helped spur market changes for clean technologies and related services. For example, we have seen a significant increase in the penetration of solar photovoltaics (PV) due to decreasing costs and increas - ing availability of financing options. The portfolio of low-energy buildings in New York City has also expand - ed. The world's largest Passive House residential tower, currently under construction on Roosevelt Island, will achieve a 60-70 percent reduction in energy use from standard construction in New York City. The city's first net-zero energy school opened in 2016 that minimizes energy use and offsets the rest of its energy consump - tion with renewable energy sources. Off-shore wind in the U.S. seems more feasible now than it did just a few years ago due in part to the construction of the Block Is - land Wind Farm, which is expected to begin operations in fall 2016 and will be the first commercial offshore wind farm in the United States. Additionally, the elec - tric vehicle market, while still small, is growing. In 2015, national electric vehicle sales were 60 percent higher than in 2014, and are projected to represent 35 percent of all new light duty vehicle sales by 2040. Advancements in climate science and GHG accounting mentodologies continue to inform our own analysis to reflect a better understanding of future emissions pro - files and trajectories. In 2015, the City signed on to the United Nations Global Compact of Mayors for Climate & Energy, committing us to work with cities across the globe and use consistent best practices in GHG emis - sions accounting in a shared effort to track progress to - ward climate mitigation goals. New York City's Roadmap to 80 x 50 offers a vision of a low-carbon New York City in 2050, based on the current state of technologies, regulations, and markets. In this document, the City presents the near-term actions that will achieve our interim target of a 40 percent GHG re - duction by 2030 (40 x 30) and the long-term strategies that will be necessary to achieve 80 x 50\u2014providing a platform for action to achieve our ambitious climate commitments while supporting the City's OneNYC vi- sions of growth, equity, sustainability, and resiliency. In 16 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50doing so, this roadmap sets the stage for the transforma - tions necessary to achieve dramatic reductions in New York City's contributions to climate change by the mid - dle of the 21st century. This report builds on the City's established climate actions and progress, and therefore contains a signifi - cant number of existing New York City initiatives, of - ten expanding their scope and impact potential to fur - ther reduce GHG emissions. Our new investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, electric vehicles, and solid waste management will also improve air qual - ity across the city and catalyze an important shift away from carbon-intensive sources of energy. Our strategic short-term initiatives will continue the critical transfor - mations of infrastructure, institutions, regulations, and markets needed to achieve 40 x 30 and place the city on a pathway to the long-term, GHG emissions reductions necessary for 80 x 50. 2005 Baseline2050Remaining GHG Emissions Reductions (MtCO 2e) MtCO 2e Reduction needed *GHG emissions from electricity production (Energy) is included in Buildings and Transportation80 x 50 Target GHG Emissions Reductions, in Million Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO 2e) Natural Gas 633 trillion BTUResidential Buildings 16.9 MtCO2e Commercial Buildings 10.3 MtCO2e Industrial & Institutional Buildings 8.7 MtCO2e Public Coal Energy1,084 trillion BTUGHG Emissions52.9 MtCO 2e Direct Use of Natural Gas 16.5 MtCO2e Petroleum 18.2 MtCO2e 2014 New York City Energy Consumption and GHG Emissions17 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50A Roadmap to 80 x 50 Current GHG emissions In 2014, New York City emitted 52.9 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO 2e) of GHG emis - sions.1 The vast majority of these emissions are the re - sult of the combustion of fossil fuels, including natural gas and petroleum, to generate utility-scale electricity and steam, provide heat and hot water for buildings, and power vehicles. A smaller share of total GHG emissions are attributed to emissions from solid waste and waste management. More than 68 percent of total citywide GHG emissions can be attributed to the energy used to power, heat, and cool buildings, which includes the emissions from burning fossil fuels both to produce heat and hot wa - ter in buildings and to generate electricity from pow - er plants. The fossil fuels burned on-site in buildings account for over more GHG emissions than our entire electricity supply. Twenty-eight percent of the city's GHG emissions come from producing electricity and using petroleum to power mass transit systems and on- road vehicles. Another four percent of GHG emissions is emitted from landfilled waste\u2014especially from food and other organic material \u2014and wastewater processing at the City's 14 wastewater treatment plants. In addition to the contributions these uses have on global climate change, their emissions burden communities with poor air quality and exacerbate disparities in related respira - tory health conditions in environmental justice neigh - borhoods. As tracked in the annual Inventory of New Y ork City Greenhouse Gas Emissions , citywide GHG emissions showed an overall decrease from 2005 to 2012. In addi - tion to a growing population and economy since 2012, the city experienced two of the coldest winters on re - cord, which drove up heating demand. Despite this de - mand, citywide GHG emissions have remained relative - ly consistent since 2012. Most of the reductions to date are a result of improvements to the electricity supply, which includes switching from oil or coal to less carbon intensive natural gas, improved operational efficiencies at existing power plants, and the construction of new, highly efficient natural gas power plants both within and outside the city.

Emissions According to the 2014 Inventory of New Y ork City Greenhouse Gas Emissions , an 80 percent reduction in citywide GHG emissions requires an additional 41 MtCO2e reduction in emissions from the 2005 baseline. Business as usual Many efforts already underway at the state and fed - eral levels will support reductions in GHG emissions, as will local policies and programs enacted prior to the de Blasio administration. Together, existing regu - lations, investments, and City programs prior to 2014 were projected to result in a reduction in citywide GHG emissions of nearly 30 percent by 2030. This is largely driven by expected changes in electric power genera - tion due to the New York State Clean Energy Standard, changes in fuel efficiency due to federal emissions stan - dards for vehicles, and the City's various initiatives to improve energy efficiency in buidlings.Business as usual and recently launched initiatives With new City initiatives launched since 2014, citywide GHG emissions are now expected to exceed 40 percent by 2030. Those initiatives include new policies and pro - grams announced in OneNYC ; One City: Built to Last ; DOT's Strategic Plan 2016 Safe\u00b7Green\u00b7Smart\u00b7Equitable . They also include Zero Waste, Vision Zero, NYC Clean Fleet, and DEP's commitment to achieve net-zero en - ergy wastewater treatment plants,in which total energy use is offset by renewable energy sources. The path forward While significant, the reductions from existing pro - grams are not sufficient to continue the pace of GHG reductions needed to achieve 80 x 50. Additionally, the city must overcome the expected increase in emissions from the potential deactivation of nuclear power in the grid serving New York City and the resulting increase in fossil fuel-based power plants to fill the electricity supply gap that it could cause. Greater GHG emissions reductions will also be challenged by legacy fossil fu - el-based systems for heating and hot water production Transportation Waste BuildingsBAU Reduction & Recently Launched Initiatives (MtCO2e) BAU reduction + recently launched initiatives 80% reduction 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050 Baseline *GHG emissions from electricity production (Energy) is included in Buildings and Transportation0102030405060Business as Usual and Recently Launched Initiatives Emissions Reductions (MtCO 2e)19 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50in buildings that are rarely replaced and the billions of vehicle miles powered by petroleum that are expected to continue to travel on city streets. Modeling the path forward The City modeled a number of scenarios to gain an un - derstanding of what is necessary to achieve 80 x 50. Al - though we cannot perfectly predict future technologies or state and federal policies, we found that 80 x 50 is attainable with solutions available today by moving ag - gressively on all fronts across energy supply, buildings, transportation, and waste. Our models project that New York City will achieve a significant portion of its GHG reductions as a result of a dramatic shift towards a renewables-based grid, supported by the implementation of New York State's Clean Energy Standard and the declining cost of renew - able energy. Large-scale renewable energy sources, in - cluding off-shore wind, utility-scale land-side solar and wind, and hydropower\u2014and the transmission of these resources into New York City's electricity grid\u2014play an important role in making this vision a reality. Within New York City's boundaries, achieving 80 x 50 will require installing a significant portion of the techni - cal potential for distributed solar PV on buildings, lots, and underutilized land. It will also require investment into low-carbon district heating and cooling networks throughout the city that are powered by renewable tech - nologies, such as ground source and water source heat pumps. Together, these building and community-scale renewable energy systems will provide New Yorkers with more energy supply choices and will enhance the resiliency of critical services in neighborhoods that are currently vulnerable to outages and weather impacts. Nearly all of the city's existing buildings will need to undergo deep energy retrofits that holistically address heating, cooling, and the building envelope. Many will need to replace fossil fuel-based heat or hot water sys - tems with renewable sources or energy efficient electric technologies to tap into a cleaner future electric grid. Retrofits to buildings will improve the quality of hous - ing, and the energy efficiency gained help keep homes affordable over the long-term. 0102030405060 2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 Transportation Roadmap (MtCO2e) 80% reduction Baseline *GHG emissions from electricity production (Energy) is included in Buildings and Transportation80 x 50 Roadmap (MtCO 2e)20 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50With over 90 percent of transportation GHG emissions attributable to on-road vehicles, the City must take steps to provide more sustainable transportation options for New Yorkers to reach their destinations, including tran - sit, walking, and bicycling. For trips that still require driving, we must transition to electric vehicle technol - ogies and renewable fuel sources. Taken together, these strategies will provide greater accessibility and choice for New Yorkers and have the potential to enhance pub - lic health by reducing air pollution and supporting for a more active lifestyles. Additionally, the City must achieve its goals for Zero Waste and net-zero energy at wastewater treatment plants. The collection and reuse of our waste resourc - es also have the potential to provide low carbon energy sources, supporting GHG reductions across the other sectors while spurring economic activity around the re - sulting products and services. Strategies for GHG emissions reductions The City is moving forward immediately with strat - egies to reduce GHG emissions from energy supply, buildings, transportation, and waste. Building on its strong climate action track record, the City has already launched a concrete set of initiatives since 2014 that will allow us to achieve our interim target of 40 x 30 and put us on a path towards 80 x 50. These have been devel - oped with a practical sense of what is doable today and a vision of what must be accomplished by 2050. While it is not possible to predict every change that will occur between now and 2050, our analysis, provides direction for the future and a platform for action our near-term actions and the long-term the policies and innovations that will ultimately be necessary to achieve 80 x 50 and our OneNYC vision of a stronger and more just city. In the pages ahead, we dive deeper into the methodologies of this analysis and the strategies for energy, buildings, transportation, and waste that the City will pursue as part of its roadmap to 80 x 50.21 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50This page left intentionally blank22 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50Methodology 23 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50Introduction York City's citywide greenhouse gas (GHG) emis - sions are calculated and reported annually according to the guidance of the Global Protocol for Communi - ty-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC) and in compliance with the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy. These methodologies, which are regularly updated based on the best-available science, provide a consistent approach for global cities to report on their progress to reduce GHG emissions. To develop this 80 x 50 roadmap, the City built upon its most recent Inventory of New Y ork City Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2014 (2014 NYC GHG Inventory ) and conducted en - hanced analysis, using best-in-class modeling tools, to project forward the city's emissions scenarios from now until 2050. Moving forward, the City will continue to update the GHG analysis used for this 80 x 50 roadmap based on (1) the best-available science, (2) the newest technologies available, and (3) actual progress made. The City will update this analysis as part of OneNYC . The methodology for this 80 x 50 roadmap began with developing distinct models for current GHG emissions and potential reductions for each of the four sectors\u2014 energy, buildings, transportation, and waste\u2014which incorporate nationally and globally recognized meth - ods that are adapted to the New York City context. The City also developed new models for decision-making, including a citywide community energy map and the NYC Greenhouse Gas Calculator. The City incorporated these models into an integrated scenario analysis that is able to compare possible future outcomes by consid - ering alternative possible events, trends, and programs across sectors. The three main scenarios analyzed were: (1) business as usual (BAU), which includes projected within New York City. GHG emissions measurement and reporting is a continually evolving science, as new data sources, emissions factors, and methodologies require consistent revision of past results and the adoption of new practices. As such, the City updates prior years' GHG results accordingly each year as it reports the most recent year's GHG emissions. There are millions of data points that produce the final aggregate GHG emissions total for New York City. Changes in total emissions from year to year within a range of plus or minus one or two percent are well within the range of uncertainty. In other words, such small changes indicate our emissions are not changing significantly enough to suggest a clear change in either direction - an increase or a decrease. Annual results are also impacted by a number of factors outside the City's control, such as weather and population growth. Even with a growing population and a growing economy, our inventory results since 2012 have shown essentially this, a flat line. Although the City continues to keep its greenhouse gas emissions level even as the city grows (an impressive feat in its own right), it is clear that deeper reductions are necessary and there is much more work to do. The City will release the Inventory of New York City Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2015 report later this fall. Results indicate New York's citywide GHG emissions for 2015 decreased one percent relative to 2014. A detailed analysis of the drivers of these changes will be included in the report.Inventory of New York City Greenhouse Gas Emissions New York City has been a leader in greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting practices since 2007 and now has one of the richest GHG datasets of any city. The City codified this process with Local Law 22 of 2008, which requires the City to complete an annual GHG inventory to measure, report, and track both citywide GHG emissions and those from City government operations. In 2015, the City signed on to the Global Compact of Mayors for Climate & Energy, committing us to work with cities across the globe and use consistent best practices in GHG emissions accounting in a shared effort to track progress toward climate mitigation goals. Accordingly, following the guidance of the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC), additional data sets and accounting methodologies were accounted for in the 2014 annual GHG inventory for the first time. The citywide GPC BASIC GHG inventory consists of all direct and indirect GHG emissions from energy used by buildings and other stationary sources; on-road transportation and public transit within the geographic borders of New York City; and fugitive GHG emissions from wastewater treatment and solid waste disposed out of the city; and natural gas distribution 24 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50growth, existing state and federal regulations, and City programs and policies that were in place before 2014; (2) BAU plus recently launched initiatives such as the 2016 Energy Code, NYC Clean Fleet, and Zero Waste; and (3) additional strategies and actions to could be de - ployed to achieve 80 x 50. Finally, the City considered how GHG reduction strategies could produce specific cobenefits for New Yorkers by promoting affordability, health and wellbeing, reliability of utilities and services, climate adaptation, job development, access to services, safety, resource preservation, culture, and social capi - tal. Throughout the process, the City engaged technical advisors and key stakeholders to help develop the as - sumptions for the GHG analysis and the transformative strategies and actions necessary to see meaningful GHG reductions and achieve 80 x 50. Modeling GHG emissions New York City's GHG emissions fall broadly into four sectors: energy, buildings, transportation, and waste. By using sector-specific modeling and integrating the outputs from each sector, the City was able to pursue a groundbreaking and granular analysis of for each sec - tor and the cross-cutting impacts of potential strate - gies and actions to guide decisions and policies going forward. Integrating these models allowed the City to understand the potential of policies to simultaneously impact different sectors. For example, the City tested the impact that widespread electrification of vehicles and building heat and hot water systems in New York City would have on the carbon intensity (the amount of GHGs emitted per unit of energy) of the regional electric grid. The City was also able to assess the impact of mandated reductions in GHG emissions from heavy trucks on both transportation and waste sector, and the contribution that collected organic waste processed through an anaerobic digester could have on meeting multiple buildings' heating needs and the potential reductions in building- and energy-related GHG emis - sions. Together, these models provided an understand - ing of GHG impacts across sectors as well as at different scales\u2014including buildings, the community, the city, and the region. Models, however, are just models; they are not perfect predictions of the future and are driven by the numer - ous assumptions (e.g., commodity costs, population growth, adoption rates) on which they are built. Some of these assumptions, such as natural gas costs, are both very uncertain and may greatly influence the city's over - all GHG emissions levels. Between now and 2050, new technological breakthroughs or fundamental economic shifts may occur that bring down costs or increase the feasibility of certain technologies. Additionally, there may be new state and federal regulations governing GHG emissions, or the introduction of a nationwide price on carbon, each of which would greatly impact GHG emissions levels. Instead of focusing on this uncertainty, the City modeled GHG emissions and potential reductions across the four sectors discussed below based on existing policies and technologies to understand how specific strategies may impact the future trajectory of GHG emissions what will ultimately be necessary to achieve 80 x 50. Our buildings model The City developed a customized Buildings Energy Model that builds on the analysis completed as part of the Buildings Technical Working Group (TWG). The model uses the city's reported building area from the NYC Department of City Planning (DCP) and the en - ergy consumption by building sector reported within the 2014 NYC GHG Inventory to estimate the citywide total annual energy use and energy use intensity (EUI) per square foot by building typology and fuel source. The model uses the 21 building typologies developed by the TWG, which break down New York City's building stock by size, age, and use. Building uses include one- to four-family residential homes, multifamily buildings, commercial buildings, industrial buildings, and institu - tional buildings. The City used population and employ - ment forecasts developed by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council (NYMTC) to project growth in the total number of buildings and built square footage for each building typology. The City also estimated the number of buildings and square footage demolished and substantially renovated based on historical NYC De - partment of Buildings (DOB) data. To estimate potential future GHG reductions from build - ings, the City built on analysis completed to estimate the impacts of the programs and policies announced in 2014 as part of One City: Built to Last (Built to Last ), and three pieces of analysis from the TWG. The analysis from the TWG included: (1) the assessment of the potential city - wide energy and GHG reductions and cost per square foot for nearly 100 \"low- and medium-difficulty\" ener - gy conservation measures (ECMs) that were identified by the group, based on Local Law 87 data and industry expertise; (2) the potential energy and GHG reductions 25 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50 Electricity Other F uels Fugitive Emissions80 x 50 Planning P rocess: Scenar io Modeling Buildings model , solid w aste forecast and GHG model , fugitive emissions analy sis and N YC GHG C alcula tor dev eloped in Ex cel by City of New York and c onsultan t team 1.

Our energy model Electricity supply To understand the influence of existing and proposed regulations, technology costs, and other factors on the regional electric grid that serves New York City, the City used modeling software called Xpand. Xpand is a regional long-term electricity generation planning and simulation model that identifies the least-cost electric - ity resource mix. Xpand simulates the electricity mar - ket's least-cost resource decisions through 2050, which include retirement of existing generating units, con -struction of new generating units, and the dispatch of electric generation across the fleet of new and existing units. Xpand also produces projected GHG emissions, electric capacity, and electricity prices that result from resource mix decisions. The model's selection of the least-cost resource mix is based on the database of existing generators, clearly de - lineated resource expansion options, electricity trans - mission constraints, state and local electricity demand across sectors, fuel price forecasts, and environmental policies. Using these inputs, the City selected multiple scenarios, described in more detail below, for which the Xpand model generated a least-cost combination of gen - eration capacity and dispatches specific to each scenar - io's set of input parameters. These scenarios included a \"business as usual\" grid scenario using the most likely assumptions, as well as bookended \"high carbon inten - sity\" and \"low carbon intensity\" electric grids based on assumptions for the inputs listed above as well as poten - tial local policies. External AssumptionsBusiness as Usual (BAU) GridThe business as usual grid represents the set of assumptions that represent the most likely trajectory of generation capacity, fuel prices, energy and peak demand growth, regional transmission capacity, and environmental policies, including the implementation of New York State's Clean Energy Standard. High Carbon Intensity (HCI) GridThe high carbon intensity grid represents a set of assumptions that represent the least favorable trajectory for achieving 80 x 50. The HCI grid assumes wind and solar costs remain at their present levels, while natural gas prices remain depressed. It also assumes that the Indian Point nuclear plant closes within the next five years, and that statewide energy and peak demand grows more quickly than in the BAU grid. Low Carbon Intensity (LCI) GridThe low carbon intensity grid represents a set of assumptions that represent the most favorable trajectory for achieving 80 x 50. The LCI grid assumes wind and solar costs decline more quickly than in the BAU grid, while natural gas prices rise more quickly. New York City Demand AssumptionsBAU DemandThe demand assumptions represent changes in energy and peak demand within New York City that could result from City policies. The BAU demand assumes that the city's peak and energy demand follow statewide trends of moderate growth, resulting from a growing population and economy, and mitigated by moderate levels of energy efficiency and other distributed energy resources. The BAU demand assumes minimal adoption of electric vehicles and electrified heating systems in buildings. Low Demand The low demand scenario assumes that the city's energy and peak demand declines with aggressive energy efficiency. This scenario also assumes that there is moderate adoption of electric vehicles and that the city achieves the technical potential for distributed solar PV, which lowers New York City's electricity consumption by 35 percent. High DemandThe high demand scenario assumptions also include aggressive energy efficiency, but assumes that the city's energy and peak demand increases with high adoption of electrified heating systems in buildings and of electric vehicles. Together these assumptions represent a 9 percent increase in New York City's electricity consumption.Electric Grid Modeling Assumptions27 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50Community energy The City also conducted an analysis of the potential im - pact of community energy solutions towards achieving 80 x 50. Community energy solutions provide heating, cooling, and/or power to multiple buildings from shared resources. The City commissioned the development of a NYC community energy map, using Excel models and open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) software, to identify and prioritize opportunities for community energy at the block level. The community energy map was calibrated to the Building Energy Model and city tax lot data, taking into consideration the city's current demands for heating, cooling, and power across different building typologies, and the physical charac - teristics of each block. Additional data layers were incor - porated to assess the technical potential and business as usual case for several technology types and estimate the GHG emissions reductions from deployment. Addition - al details on the community energy map are included in the Energy chapter. Our transportation model Reducing transportation-related GHG emissions will require both people and goods to move differently than they move today. In order to envision these fu - ture changes, the City created several models to quan - tify the necessary shifts to lower- or zero-carbon modes of transportation, improvements to the transportation network's efficiency, and the introduction of low-carbon fuels and vehicles to reduce GHG impacts of the vehi - cles that will remain on the road in 2050. The analysis of transportation mode shifts was grounded in the use of the Best Practice Model (BPM) developed by NYMTC. The BPM forecasts travel patterns in the New York City region (28 counties in New York, New Jer - sey, and Connecticut) in response to changes in regional demographic profiles and transportation systems. The BPM provides a useful framework to evaluate changes in vehicle miles traveled and mode shares in the context of currently adopted transportation projects, along with potential future scenarios that result in an even great - er share of trips by low-carbon modes of travel. Com - bined with an evaluation of Regional Household Travel Survey (RHTS) data, which breaks down current trips by mode, multiple scenarios were developed reflecting changes in mode shares to more efficient and cleaner modes of travel resulting from a range of transportation policies and programs. The travel activity-based analysis provided information on various transportation sectors, which was then trans - lated into GHG emissions estimates using the U.S. Envi - ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2014 Motor Vehi - cle Emission Simulator (MOVES) model. The MOVES model is the U.S. EPA's most advanced tool for estimat - ing emissions from a wide range of mobile sources. The City employed the MOVES model to estimate average per-mile emissions rates from the various transporta - tion sectors over time, which shows GHG reductions as the vehicles become cleaner, more efficient, use more renewable fuels, and include increasing amounts of electric and other zero and near-zero emission technol - ogies. Combining the transportation activity data with emissions factors derived from MOVES provided the GHG emissions estimates used to model the City's path to 80 x 50 in the transportation sector. Our waste model The City assessed the GHG impacts of solid waste and wastewater management, both of which currently result in methane emissions, which is a GHG that is signifi - cantly more potent than carbon dioxide. For solid waste, the GHG analysis entailed forecasting generated waste materials out to 2050, characterizing the waste gener - ated by material type (e.g., food waste, paper), and then modeling the GHG impact by the tonnage of material type that is either landfilled or composted. The forecast of total solid waste includes a projection of waste and recycling materials generated by residents, businesses, and construction in New York City through 2050, using an econometric model based on historical New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY) data. The econometric model incorporates the impact of real per capita income to approximate consumption and population, to which a linear trend is added to reflect the general trend towards reduced waste generation in the city and nationwide. For commercial waste, a long-term forecast was developed using sectoral commercial waste generation factors per employee (tons per employee per year) by specific industry. For example, restaurants will generate more food waste than commercial office buildings, so it was necessary to forecast the growth of New York City-specific industries by employment to be able to estimate the amount of commercial waste gener - ated for different materials. After the total forecast was developed, the City completed a waste characterization of residential and commercial waste and for construc - tion and demolition (C&D) debris. 28 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50The City initially used the U.S. EPA's Waste Reduction Model (WARM) to measure the GHG emissions result - ing from various waste reduction strategies. However, because WARM calculates GHG emissions that are out - side of the city's GHG inventory boundaries (e.g., up - stream, life cycle emissions), the City elected to measure projected GHG emissions from landfilled and compost - ed waste using the methodologies recommended by the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC), consistent with other sec - tors and with most cities globally. Per GPC guidance, GHG emissions from the incineration of waste are in - corporated into the GHG emissions from the electric - ity supply. The associated reduction in landfilled waste from this strategy was included in future waste genera - tion projections. Emissions from wastewater treatment were developed based on electricity and fuel usage at the NYC Depart - ment of Environmental Protection's (DEP) facilities, as well as the fugitive emissions from anaerobic digestion methane production and nitrogen emissions resulting from the treatment process. City specific models were created using GPC methodology and the Biosolids Emis - sions Assessment Model (BEAM) to estimate the emis - sions associated with biosolids disposal alternatives. The City's integrated GHG analysis: The NYC Greenhouse Gas Calculator The City created the NYC Greenhouse Gas Calculator as a tool that brings together outputs from the model - ing efforts across the four sectors to evaluate the impact of potential strategies and actions on New York City's GHG emissions. The model allows the City to calculate the GHG emissions associated with all fuel sources, in - cluding electricity, natural gas, petroleum sources, and waste streams and to calculate avoided emissions from potential strategies, such as transportation mode shifts or building retrofit paths. It also allows the City to test the impact of both individual and combined strategies on overall GHG emissions to understand the potential interdependencies of the sectors. The City compiled the outputs of GHG modeling for each sector into this integrated model, ensuring consistent emissions multi - pliers, referred to as carbon coefficients, to convert each source into GHG emissions and omit any duplicative ac - counting. One important aspect of the NYC Greenhouse Gas Cal - culator is the ability to see the influence of changes in the carbon intensity of the electricity grid on the po - tential strategies implemented across the sectors. This allowed the City to develop bookend scenarios based on local strategies and actions as well as uncertainty for factors affecting the electric grid that are largely outside of the City's control. The resulting model highlights the interrelationships of the various sectors and strategies, helping to better understand uncertainties, impacts, and priorities. Scenario analysis Scenario analysis is the process of comparing possible future outcomes by considering alternative possible events, trends, and programs. During the 80 x 50 plan - ning efforts, the City assessed three types of scenarios: BAU, BAU plus recently launched initiatives, and 80 x 50. Business as usual (BAU) scenario The BAU projection took into account expected popu - lation growth and economic development and incorpo - rated the expected outcomes of existing city, state, and federal policies and regulations that took effect before 2014. To estimate potential electricity sector emissions, this scenario includes electricity-related state and federal policies, including the New York State's Clean Energy Standard (CES), the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), and the federal Clean Power Plan, as well as ex - pected trends for electricity demand from the 2015 NY - ISO Gold Book, natural gas prices (gas forward prices, AEO), and renewable energy costs (AEO, NREL), which were modeled in Xpand. This scenario also included the impact of different costs for utility-scale solar, offshore wind, and natural gas; levels of energy efficiency and distributed energy resources; new transmission lines to upstate large-scale renewable energy; and timing of re - tirements of the nuclear plants in New York State. For buildings, the BAU scenario includes all GHG reduc - tions achieved to date from buildings and the existing projections from all policies enacted before 2014. These include the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan, updates to the Energy Code, and the implementation of the City's regulations phasing out the use of heavy heating oil. The BAU scenario for buildings also includes projected reductions from the electricity supply under the BAU grid scenario. 29 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50For transportation, the BAU scenario involved adding to the MOVES model the benefits of the recently-adopted U.S. EPA/National Highway Traffic Safety Administra - tion (NHTSA) fuel economy and GHG rules for medi - um- and heavy-duty trucks, federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for light-duty vehicles, and existing New York City Local Laws that cover emis - sions in heavy-duty vehicles and buses. Additionally, the BAU scenario included committed expansions to city - wide ferry service, Citi Bike (Phase 2), the subway sys - tem (2nd Avenue Subway Phase 1), and rail (East Side Access), among others, as well as reductions attributable to the reduced carbon intensity of the BAU electric grid. To develop BAU projections for solid waste, the City modeled total waste volumes to the year 2050 to in - corporate both expected population growth and em - ployment trends. The City used current recycling rates of 16 percent for residential waste and 26 percent for commercial waste for the analysis to generate estimates of gross tonnage destined for disposal. These recycling estimates are based on DSNY's data from residential col - lections as well as information from carter reporting. The transportation emission impacts of in-city waste collection incorporated DSNY-funded and/or imple - mented NYC Clean Fleet initiatives as well as imple - mentation of NYC Local Law 145, which will require the conversion of commercial waste vehicles to cleaner trucks by 2020. The BAU analysis also included full im - plementation of the NYC Solid Waste Management Plan (SWMP), a twenty-year plan first approved in 2006 for the development of borough-based facilities to enable the export of waste via the use of rail and/or barge trans - port rather than long-haul trucking to landfills. Prior to the SWMP, trucking had been the sole method of export for the City's residential waste with the closure of the Fresh Kills landfill. However, while the SWMP results in lower GHG emissions from reduced trucking, these emissions are outside the city's boundary and are not in - cluded in the city's GHG inventory, per GPC guidance. BAU scenario plus recently launched initiatives The second scenario added recently launched (2014 or later) City-led initiatives to the BAU findings. This in - cluded estimates of the potential future GHG impact of these recent initiatives, many of which are still in the planning or early implementation phases. For buildings, this included all policies and programs that were announced in Built to Last, as well as a number of initiatives announced or launched with the release of the One City: Built to Last Technical Working Group Re - port (the TWG Report ). These include the 2016 Energy Code, new steam systems requirements that will be in - corporated into Local Law 87, and mandates for several key low- to medium-difficulty ECMs. This scenario also included estimated GHG reductions from Local Law 31, which will set an energy performance standard for new municipal buildings of at least 50 percent lower than existing standards, and phasing in a performance-based Energy Code for privately-owned buildings meeting the same standard beginning in 2022. The City modeled these reductions using the BAU grid, which contributed additional GHG reductions from the electricity supply. In the transportation sector, the City added several as - sumptions to the BAU scenario to capture the current or planned implementation of programs like Vision Zero, NYC Clean Fleet, and DOT's 2016 Strategic Plan. These also include expansions to Select Bus Service and the construction of the Brooklyn Queens Connector (BQX), future growth of Citi Bike and new investments in our bicycle network, the shift of all agency non-emergency sedan vehicle purchases to electric vehicles as of 2017, and a reactivation of the South Brooklyn Marine Termi - nal. The City modeled these reductions using the BAU grid scenario. The City applied its Zero Waste diversion targets to the BAU future waste generation tonnages to estimate GHG reductions from the waste sector. The recovery factors applied are similar to the recovery achieved by high-performing municipalities in the U.S., such as Se - attle and San Francisco, which have aggressive policies and regulations to target the recovery and diversion of municipal solid waste. Additional projected reductions in wastewater treatment-related emissions are based on existing DEP initiatives to reduce fugitive methane, in - crease methane capture and utilization, and reduce the electricity required for wastewater processing through the implementation of energy conservation measures. Reductions in electricity and fuel usage are based on detailed energy audits conducted by DEP at each of its wastewater treatment plants. Scenarios to get to 80 x 50 The final scenario projects the impacts from various levels of plausible action across sectors to achieve 80 x 50, testing both moderate and aggressive efforts. For buildings, the Buildings Energy Model incorporat - ed the results of the deep energy retrofit path analysis 30 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50conducted by the TWG and applied the projected EUIs from each retrofit paths across all relevant buildings citywide, making appropriate updates for certain build - ing typologies. The City built the model to be able to vary the rates of adoption for each retrofit path, allow - ing various rates for paths that include high efficiency electrified space conditioning (heating and cooling), electrified domestic hot water (DHW) production, and re-cladding of the building envelop. The City also modeled proposed Energy Code updates that achieve between 50 and 70 percent reductions in energy use from current standards for all new and sub - stantially renovated buildings, beginning in 2022. For new construction, the City established energy use inten - sity values based on ASHRAE 90.1 2013 guidelines and applied to the projected growth in built area. The City also incorporated projected GHG reductions from com - munity energy systems from its community energy map analysis, which included community-scale wind, com - bined heat and power (CHP), ground source and water source heat pumps (GSHP, WSHP) and heat capture from power plants, substations, and building cooling systems. The City also included the technical potential for on-site and community-scale solar PV, based on the City University of New York's (CUNY) Solar Map, which was modeled as a reduction in electricity use based on multiple rates of adoption of the full technical potential. For transportation, the City's model assumed four out of five intra-city trips would be made by sustainable modes (walking, biking, and transit) in 2050. This split reflects a reasonable expectation of potential mode shift as a re - sult of increased and sustained investments in low-car - bon mode service and infrastructure. An 80 percent sus - tainable mode split goal is also consistent with similar long-term targets in several of New York's peer cities. Such a reduction includes an approximate 40 percent reduction in person trips that are today made by car, from 33 percent to 20 percent. Of these remaining vehi - cle trips, almost half are made through taxi trips, shared mobility services, or new forms of on-demand, high-ca - pacity \"microtransit\" services. Only 12 percent of to - tal trips remain as traditional personal driving trips, a reasonable assumption given emerging mobility trends and a decline in traditional auto-ownership patterns. These vehicle trips were modeled to be much cleaner than today, with higher rates of adoption of low-carbon fuels and vehicles, especially in private fleets. The 80 x 50 scenario modeling assumes approximately 50 per - cent of new vehicles purchased in 2050 will create zero emissions, such as battery electric, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles. For waste, the GHG reductions from the implementa - tion of Zero Waste by 2030 and net-zero energy at DEP in-city wastewater treatment plants were extended out to 2050. To develop the final 80 x 50 scenario, the City assumed full implementation of all identified transportation and waste strategies. For buildings, the City tested various adoption rates across the retrofit paths to find the sce - nario that yielded the greatest GHG reductions with the lowest uptake of strategies that include electrifica - tion of heating and hot water systems or recladding of buildings, which ultimately yielded a scenario in which between 50 and 60 percent of buildings pursue these strategies. The City assumed full implementation of a performance-based Energy Code for new and substan - tially renovated buildings that achieves a 70 percent reduction in energy use from existing standards begin - ning in 2022. The City assumed uptake of full techni - cal potential for solar PV and a portion of the potential for other community energy solutions. Finally, for the electricity sector, the City used a modified version of the \"bookended\" low carbon intensity scenario from the Xpand modeling effort, which included slight increase in carbon intensity of the electric grid from the low car - bon intensity grid based on the increased adoption of electric vehicles and building electrification than what was included in that scenario. All together, the modeling efforts across the energy sup - ply, buildings, transportation, and waste demonstrates that achieving 80 x 50 in New York City is possible, but requires aggressive action across all strategies and across all sectors. Stakeholder engagement Throughout the process of developing its 80 x 50 road - map, the City engaged technical advisors and key stake - holders to develop of the assumptions for the GHG anal - ysis, ensure the approach was consistent with modeling underway for parallel local and regional planning, and to develop the potential GHG reduction strategies that were incorporated into the scenario analysis. The City hosted 17 focus group meetings with more than 100 technical and policy experts, including representatives from academia, regional think tanks, national environ - mental organizations, local environmental justice advo - cates, utilities, industry leaders, and state agencies and 31 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50authorities. These stakeholders helped envision New York City's roadmap 80 x 50 and the transformative actions that will ultimately be necessary to achieve it. They also provided feedback on potential policy options and implementation details that will result in meaning - ful emissions reductions. Strategy analysis and benefits of 80 x 50 The City combined the modeling outputs, stakeholder feedback, and an assessment of existing City policies and programs to identify key opportunities and chal - lenges to achieve 80 x 50 that are presented in each sector chapter. The City then developed strategies to amplify the opportunities and begin addressing the challenges. These potential strategies covered a variety of scales, from individuals and buildings to the entire city and the regional power grid, and considered over - laps across the buildings, energy supply, transportation, and waste sectors. Achieving 80 x 50 presents a unique opportunity for New York City to continue its global leadership on en - vironmental action. At the same time, 80 x 50 serves as a roadmap that provides the city with direction on how to grow a dynamic and inclusive economy to spur in - novation, develop globally-recognized industries with the potential for high-paying jobs, and to make the city more resilient against climate change and other 21st century threats. The City has made equity an explicit guiding principle of its environmental agenda\u2014a lens through which we view all of our planning, policymaking, and governing. As such, the strategies and policy options necessary for 80 x 50 will be further evaluated and prioritized to access cobenefits across all four lenses of OneNYC through their ability to promote affordability, health and wellbeing, reliability of utilities and services, adap - tation, economic opportunity, diversification, and flexi - bility of services, and access for all New Yorkers.Stakeholders and technical advisors at an 80 x 50 focus group meeting 32 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycEnergyEnergy33 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Energy In 2050... We envision that New York City's energy supply will have undergone a transformation. New York State will have a prevalent supply of large-scale renewable energy from sources outside of New York City. New transmission lines will connect New York City to those resources and will provide an added level of reliability to our energy system. Natural gas will continue to be an important resource, but will shift to a supporting role in the overall electricity mix by providing fuel diversity and supporting reliability. Distributed energy resources will be prevalent and de - liver clean, affordable, and resilient energy to neighbor - hoods throughout the five boroughs, including to low- and moderate-income communities, which will allow New York City residents and communities to enjoy their benefits. We will have the technologies and market con - ditions to seamlessly manage demand and supply, from individual buildings to the electric grid, while consumers of energy will play a more informed and active role in how they use, manage, and even generate energy.34 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycEnergyAchieving 80 x 50: Energy The path towards 80 x 50 requires strong partnerships across all levels of government, and it requires working closely with utilities to ensure that our climate mitigation and adaptation goals guide infrastructure investment decisions. Achieving significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions for buildings, transportation, and waste is contingent upon a transition towards a renew - able energy-based electric grid. Since the City does not directly regulate energy supply, we will need to contin - ue advocating for regulatory changes and infrastructure improvements that will allow renewable sources of ener - gy to flow into the five boroughs. The City can leverage its purchasing power to help support this investment, as the City's municipal operations consume one-tenth of all electricity in New York City. Within the city, existing power plants must improve ef - ficiencies and reduce emissions in the near term. In the long term, the fleet of in-city power plants will need to transition towards more flexible sources of power that can be quickly ramped up or ramped down to help bal - ance a renewables-based grid that will have more inter - mittent sources of power from solar and wind. In addi - tion, the infrastructure needed to transmit and distribute electricity across the city will need to integrate technolo - gies that improve efficiency and flexibility. Distributed energy resources (DERs)\u2014which include customer-owned renewable energy sources, energy effi - cient technologies and strategies, and energy storage\u2014 will need to be aggregated to meet electric demand or the needs of the electricity system as a whole. These resources will need to be scaled up at both the building and community levels, and new regulatory and financial structures will need to evolve to support the deployment of DERs in order to achieve the 80 x 50 vision of a clean, affordable, and resilient energy supply. The adoption of promising new emerging technologies must also be fa - cilitated by pilot projects to demonstrate their perfor - mance and cost-effectiveness - a place where the City can play a key role. Drivers of GHG Emissions New York City's energy supply is primarily comprised of electricity that comes from the regional grid, which is used to power buildings and our electrified transporta - tion networks; natural gas and petroleum used to power vehicles and provide heating, cooling, and hot water in buildings; and district steam from Con Edison that is also used for heating and cooling in buildings. Approximately 30 percent of citywide GHG emissions are attributable to the power plants that generate elec - tricity both within and outside of New York City. While most of those plants generate electricity by combusting fossil fuels, a significant portion also comes zero-carbon nuclear generation. The 24 in-city power plants that directly serve New York City have a combined capacity of approximately 10,000 MW\u2014enough to meet over 80 percent of the city's peak demand, which meets the reliability requirement of the New York State Reliability Council (NYSRC). On an an - nual basis, generation from these power plants provides approximately 50 percent of the electricity consumed in New York City. A majority of the balance originates from less expensive and cleaner sources elsewhere in New York State and surrounding regions. Energy is imported into New York City from a regional system of high-voltage transmission lines. These amount to little more than a handful of lines that connect the city with approximately 6,000 MW of electricity supply from areas as close as the Hudson Valley and northern New Jersey, northern and western New York State, Pennsylva - nia, and New England. Each of these regions has a differ - ent fuel supply mix. In 2014, power transmitted into the city consisted primarily of natural gas (67%) and nuclear (31%), with less than 2 percent coming from landfill gas, hydropower, coal, wind, solar, and other fuel sources. DERs are a small but growing source of energy for New York City. These include distributed generation (DG) technologies that provide energy to customers at the community scale or even the building scale, as opposed to the traditional model in which utilities centrally pro - cure and distribute energy to customers. DG can include customer-owned renewable energy sources as well as fuel cells and combined heat and power (CHP) systems. CHP systems co-generate electricity and useful heat lo - cally, which allows for greater efficiencies than a typical power plant. Depending on system size, the electric and thermal energy can be distributed to one or more build - ings. To date, there is more than 300 MW of DG installed citywide. In addition, DERs such as energy efficiency and energy storage\u2014spurred in part by local policies such as the City's Greener, Greater Buildings Plan (GGBP)\u2014have contributed to a reduction in energy consumption in buildings since 2005. Electricity was the city's largest source of GHG emissions prior to 2013, but has since been supplanted by petro -35 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Energyleum, largely used for on-road transportation, which generates 34 percent of the city's GHG emissions. Natu - ral gas burned on-site to provide heating and hot water in buildings generates 31 percent. GHG emissions from the city's electricity supply have decreased by roughly 40 percent since 2005, which is largely the result of con - version away from coal and oil in power plants towards cleaner-burning natural gas as well as the retirement of older, less efficient power plants. Operational improve - ments on the part of Consolidated Edison (Con Edison), the investor-owned electric utility that serves the major - ity of New York City residents and businesses, have fur - ther contributed to these reductions. At the same time, natural gas usage has been growing due to a combination of low natural gas prices and regulations enacted by the City in 2011 phasing out the use of No. 6 and No. 4 heavy heating oils by 2015 and 2030, respectively. While natural gas burns cleaner than other fossil fuels such as oil or coal and has been the major driver of emis - sions reductions achieved since 2005, New York City will not meet its 80 x 50 commitment if we continue to con - sume natural gas at today's rate. In addition, with natural gas as the predominant fuel source for the city's power plants and for building heating and hot water, there is a need for the City to explore greater diversification of supply sources to enhance reliability and increase resil - iency to potential supply interruptions.Con Edison's district steam system is one of the largest district-scale heating and cooling network in the Unit - ed States. District heating and cooling networks consist of pipes in the ground connected to an energy source that can provide heating and cooling to more than one building. The system has served New York City's build - ings for over 130 years, and continues to serve close to 1,700 customers in Manhattan, including some of the city's most iconic skyscrapers. The district steam system contributes 2 percent of citywide GHG emissions and has been getting cleaner over time. District steam has experienced a 33 percent decrease in carbon intensity between 2005 and 2014, largely as a result of the tran - sition to an increasing use of CHP units that generate electricity and steam in a single integrated system. Business as usual findings To understand what it will take to achieve 80 x 50, the City modeled projected GHG reductions under a busi - ness as usual (BAU) scenario for each sector through 2050. The BAU analysis for energy supply examines multiple potential trajectories for the New York City electric grid through 2050. The analysis takes into ac - count expected changes in electric demand associated with population growth and economic development, as well as potential adoption of DERs. It also incorpo - rates the expected impacts of existing state and federal policies and regulations by modeling electricity-related Other (includes Kerosene, Biomass, Land/f_ill Gas, Municipal Solid Waste)Solar WindHydro NuclearNatural Gas Fuel OilCoalNYC Electric Grid Mix and Emissions Intensity (Business as Usual) 2005 Baseline2014 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050Business Grid Fuel Mix36 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc renewable energy policies, including New York State's Clean Energy Standard (CES), the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), and the federal Clean Power Plan (CPP), as well as expected trends for electricity demand, natural gas prices, and renewable energy costs. The City sought expert opinions to assess the expected outcomes of policies that were in development at the time of analy - sis, such as the State's Clean Energy Standard (CES). From this analysis, the City found that under the most likely scenario (the \"BAU grid\"), the carbon intensity of the city's electric supply\u2014or the amount of GHG emis - sions per unit of energy\u2014is projected to become 50-60 percent cleaner by 2030 relative to 2005 levels. The re - sults of the analysis are driven by an increasing propor - tion of electricity from utility-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) systems and land-based wind turbines in the grid mix, consistent with the CES requirement to meet 50 percent of New York State's electricity with renewable Energy Policy in New York State Reforming the Energy Vision The New York State Public Service Commission (PSC), which regulates utility companies, initiated Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) in April 2014 to transform the State's electric distribution sys - tems. Specifically, REV seeks to advance ener - gy policies and markets to speed the adoption of energy efficiency and clean, locally produced power, as well as to modernize aging infrastruc - ture and enhance the security and resiliency of the grid. This includes promoting smart grid tech - nology and markets that enable greater efficien - cy and demand flexibility. Additionally, regulato - ry changes are expected to give customers new opportunities for energy savings as well as local power generation and enhanced reliability. These will result in safe, clean, and affordable electric service, empowering New Yorkers to make in - formed energy choices, creating new jobs, and reducing GHG emissions. The City is supporting the REV objectives and is advocating for social, environmental, and physi - cal considerations that are unique to the city to be integrated into the regulatory process. This in - cludes the promotion of DER deployment to ben - efit all New York City communities. Clean Energy Standard The Clean Energy Standard (CES), adopted by the PSC in August 2016, was developed to lower GHG emissions and reduce air pollution from the state's energy generation resources and ensure a reliable and diverse energy supply. The CES is an enforce - able mandate that will require 50 percent of New York's electricity to come from renewable energy sources by 2030. Under the CES, utilities and other energy suppliers will be required to obtain Renewable Energy Credits through procurements of new renewable energy re - sources. The CES also includes directives regarding energy efficiency and additional renewable energy sources beyond land-based wind and solar. These include the evaluation of low-carbon heat sourc - es such as geothermal heat pumps, a blueprint to advance offshore wind to be developed by the New York State Energy Research & Development Agen - cy, and a commitment by the PSC to work with New York Independent System Operator and other stake - holders to ensure necessary investments are made in transmission, storage, and smart grid technol - ogies to ensure the reliability of the grid. The CES also seeks to maintain zero-carbon nuclear power resources in the state by requiring investor-owned utilities to purchase Zero-Emission Credits. energy sources by 2030 (see box above). Additionally, power plants within New York City are expected to con - tinue to transition towards natural gas-fired combustion turbines, while older, less efficient power plants are ex - pected to retire. The carbon intensity of the grid is anticipated to begin to rise between 2030 and 2035 as existing nuclear pow - er plants start to retire. Nuclear plants currently gener - ate 31 percent of the city's electricity. When they retire, large-scale renewables such as wind and solar are ex - pected to fill some but not all of the electricity gap. The remainder is projected to be met with natural gas capac - ity, which will lead to an increase in GHG emissions rela - tive to zero-emission nuclear generation. As a result, the city's electricity supply is projected to be 50 percent less carbon intensive in 2050 relative to 2005 levels, and 23 percent less carbon intensive than today.37 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Energy Generators will continue to exist within New York City to meet the NYSRC regulatory reliability requirement for sufficient in-city generation capacity, with the least efficient units replaced by fast-ramping combustion tur - bines by 2030. While in-city generators are expected to provide 40-50 percent of the city's electricity in the near term, in-city generators are projected to run for fewer hours each year as a greater proportion of electricity is delivered from outside New York City. Modeling results show they may provide less than 30 percent in 2050, fa - cilitated by the addition of transmission across the state and into the city. Given the level of uncertainty about how fuel prices and the capital costs of renewable energy generation will change over time, the City also modeled two \"bookend\" scenarios that reflect a \"high carbon intensity grid\" and a \"low carbon intensity grid.\" The high carbon intensity (HCI) grid assumes natural gas prices will remain low and renewable energy costs stay comparatively high. The low carbon intensity (LCI) grid assumes the opposite, with gas prices rising and renewable generation costs falling, along with augmented transmission capacity throughout the state to facilitate the flow of renewable energy into the city. The City's modeling revealed that the carbon in - tensity of the low carbon intensity grid is expected to be more than 70 percent lower in 2050 than in 2005, with an estimated 70-75 percent renewables in the grid mix, while the high carbon intensity grid is expected to be roughly 25 percent lower, with roughly 50 percent re - newables in the grid mix\u2014the minimum needed for CES compliance. Based on the BAU analysis, the main external drivers of the electric grid's carbon intensity are fuel prices, capi - tal costs of renewables, and state environmental policies. The City also investigated how New York City electricity demand affects the electricity supply. The City developed one scenario in which New York City's annual electricity use and peak demand each increase by roughly 10 per - cent due to widespread electrification of certain building systems and electric vehicle adoption. The City devel - 00.020.040.060.080.100.120.14tCO2e / MM BTUCarbon Intensity Scenar ios for the 2050 Electric Grid /uni00A0 Historical Carbon Intensity Grid BAU Carbon Intensity Grid BAU Carbon Intensity Grid RangeHigh Carbon Intensity Grid Low Carbon Intensity Grid2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030 2035 2040 2045 2050 High Carbon Intensity Grid RangeLow Carbon Intensity Grid Range Modeled Future Carbon Intensity of Electric Grid and Ranges based on Changes to NYC Electric Demand (tCO 2e/MMBtu)38 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycEnergyoped an alternate scenario in which annual electricity use and peak demand each decrease by 30-35 percent, due to the adoption of energy efficiency in buildings and community-scale DERs. When these scenarios were modeled on the BAU grid, low carbon intensity grid, and high carbon intensity grid, there was little change in the overall grid carbon intensity in any scenario. Changes in New York City demand could have an impact on the amount of generation that would be constructed, but the analysis found that overall fuel mix and carbon intensity would not be influenced. In this analysis, in - creases in New York City demand were largely met by cleaner and less costly sources imported from outside of the city. This means that an increase in the number of electric vehicles and electrification of certain building systems could be effective means of reducing New York City's GHG emissions without generating significant un - intended consequences for the carbon intensity of the electric grid. Emerging Trends The pace of innovation in sustainable energy has been accelerating. Advances in technologies including solar PV, energy storage, anaerobic digestion, and electric grid operations are allowing clean energy technologies to become more efficient, flexible, and cost-competitive with traditional sources of energy. These advancements, along with market growth and environmental policies, are resulting in lower costs and accordingly increasing demand for clean energy technologies. Solar PV . Renewable energy sources are becoming in - creasingly economically competitive with natural gas generation. The costs of solar PV have decreased dra - matically, dropping more than 50 percent between 2002 and 2013, and are expected to continue their decline. Ac - cording to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the capital cost of utility-scale solar is project - ed to decrease more than 40 percent between 2016 and 2030.1 Solar adoption is growing as a result of falling prices, as well as supportive policies like the federal investment tax credit and new financing mechanisms including solar loans and leases. In 2015, New York State installed 242 MW of solar electric capacity, a 65 percent increase over the previous year. While there are still financial and reg - ulatory hurdles to solar adoption in New York City, there is currently 78 MW of installed solar in the city (private and public sector combined) and another 17 MW in the pipeline, compared to a total of 2 MW of installed solar in the city just ten years ago. Various procurement and financing programs are help - ing to spur this growth. These include solar group pur - chasing programs, which pool demand to lower the cost of solar installations, and community shared solar poli - cies, which allow multiple customers to purchase or sub - scribe to a portion of a common solar installation. With the enactment of community shared distributed gen - eration (DG) in New York State just last year, multiple customers are now able to subscribe to shares of output from a common solar array, even if they live in anoth - er part of the city. This change has opened up the solar market to renters who until now have not been able to access the benefits of local solar energy. Solar hardware is also rapidly evolving and reshaping the cityscape. The use of solar canopies in the city is rising and has the potential to grow. While space for solar PV installations has historically been limited to portions of rooftops due to competing infrastructure and fire safety requirements, solar canopies can help overcome this lim - itation by elevating solar panels nine or more feet above building rooftops. As a result, solar canopies have the $3$6$9$12$15 Residential & Commer cial Solar SystemsHistorical Prices of Solar PV Systems (2014 US$/W)39 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Energypotential to enable two to three times as much solar PV capacity on a given roof relative to conventional designs. Energy storage. Significant technological advance - ments have also occurred in the field of energy storage. Energy storage, through the use of technologies such as batteries, allows excess energy to be produced at one point in time and stored for later use. This helps over - come the problem of intermittency, which is common with renewable energy sources such as solar PV, in which energy cannot be produced at constant output due to the availability of natural resources such as sunlight or wind. Consequently, renewable energy production cannot al - ways be matched to energy demand. Improvements to energy storage technologies such as lithium-ion and vanadium flux redox batteries are allowing for greater amounts of storage to be deployed at lower costs, which can allow for greater deployment of renewable energy sources. Energy storage is another option to provide flexibil - ity to balance energy demands and electric generation from the power grid. Energy storage has the potential to make both on-site and utility-scale renewable energy generation more useful, support microgrids, reduce peak demand, or shift demand to provide grid reliability and reduce electricity costs. At the utility scale, energy stor - age can provide flexibility to grid operators in managing the generation variability from intermittent renewable energy resources, which will become increasingly criti - cal as New York City's electricity supply becomes more reliant on renewables. One type of energy storage comes in the form of thermal energy storage (TES), which refers to technologies that make it possible to store heat or chilled water for use at a later time. For instance, a residential building with solar thermal collectors and TES can generate hot wa - ter over the course of the day and store it for use when residential heating demands are highest at night. Anoth - er example, sometimes referred to as \"ice storage,\" is a cooling system used to generate and store chilled water mixed with glycol in tanks during off-peak hours, usually at night, when electricity is less expensive. TES can as - sist the transition to a renewables-based grid by balanc - ing thermal energy demands between peak and off-peak hours, or even from season to season. Community energy. Technological advancements have also improved the outlook for community-scale energy solutions, including microgrids and district heating and Solar canopy in Brooklyn Photo credit: Situ Studio40 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycEnergyCommunity Energy Solutions Microgrid A microgrid is an electrical distribution network that is connected to two or more buildings in a local area. With the appropriate controls and design, microgrids can enter into 'island mode' and provide power when there is a grid outage. Energy Sources Heat Capture Heat capture refers to a suite of technologies that recover waste heat from commercial and industrial activities. Heat rejected from building cooling systems can also be captured and utilized for space heating. Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Combined heat and power, also known as cogeneration, is the simultaneous production of two or more useful forms of energy from a single device. A CHP system will take fuel, most commonly natural gas, to generate electricity and heat. Combined cooling, heat and power also includes the production of cooling. Solar Thermal Solar thermal systems utilize solar energy to generate hot water that can be used for domestic hot water and/or space heating in buildings. It is often paired with thermal energy storage. Energy Storage Energy storage technologies save generated energy and use it when demand is high. Energy storage includes electric systems such as batteries as well as thermal systems such as hot and cold water storage tanks. District Heating and Cooling District heating and cooling systems, also referred to jointly as \"district energy,\" produce steam, hot water, or chilled water that is piped underground to multiple buildings. They can provide environmental, operational, and financial benefits by leveraging economies of scale. 2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 District Heating District Cooling3 MicrogridENERGY CENTER 2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 3 Microgrid District Heating District Cooling2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 3 Microgrid District Heating District Cooling 2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 3 Microgrid District Heating District Cooling 2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 3 Microgrid District Heating District Cooling 2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 3 Microgrid District Heating District CoolingEnergy storage can operate critical systems during outages. Distributed Generation Distributed generation technologies allow customers to generate electricity onsite through solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, combined heat and power (CHP), and other technologies. Community Shared Solar Community shared solar installations allow multiple customers to subscribe to shares of output from a solar PV array. The array can be connected to a microgrid or it can be located in another part of the city. Geothermal Heat Pumps Geothermal heat pumps use onsite energy from underground temperature differentials to heat and cool buildings with rewarding reductions in energy use. They are also known as ground source heat pumps. Water Source Heat Pumps Water source heat pumps extract or reject heat from large water bodies to heat and cool buildings. This term is also used for heat capture systems that utilize water loops within buildings and districts (see heat capture).2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 3 Microgrid District Heating District Cooling 2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 3 Microgrid District Heating District Cooling2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 3 Microgrid District Heating District Cooling2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 3 Microgrid District Heating District Cooling 2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 3 Microgrid District Heating District Cooling 2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 3 Microgrid District Heating District Cooling 2 5 7 6 4 8 9 1 3 Microgrid District Heating District Cooling41 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Energycooling networks. Microgrids are small-scale electric grids that connect more than one building to a power source and can integrate DERs\u2014including renewables, fuel cells, and CHP units. When combined with energy storage and demand management strategies to reduce peak demand (see Buildings chapter), microgrids pro - duce clean electricity that also improve the reliability of energy services for customers. Following the devastation of Hurricane Sandy, the City and State have supported the evaluation and installation of new microgrids in the city that can function independently from the central electric grid and can support critical loads in the event of a power outage. District heating and cooling networks provide similar benefits for buildings that are connected to a shared source of heating and cooling. Prices have fallen for many DERs that can be deployed as part of a microgrid or a district heating and cooling network. The current low cost of natural gas in partic - ular creates favorable economics for CHP deployment. Natural gas-fired CHP installations have increased over the last decade, with more than 230 MW of distributed CHP generation now installed in New York City. Based on the carbon intensity of today's grid, CHP units reduce GHG emissions relative to electricity from the grid due to their effective usage of waste heat. They can also serve as a reliable and cost-effective anchor for district heating and cooling networks (refer to box at left) and could be used to establish a platform for clean localized energy solutions in the future that integrate more renewable en - ergy sources. However, as the electric grid continues to become clean - er, the GHG emissions associated with natural gas-fired CHP will eventually reach a \"breakeven\" point at which the electricity generated by CHP is no longer less carbon intensive than the grid. Globally, there are examples of CHP installations that incorporate renewable fuel sourc - es, such as biomass and synthetic natural gas. Biomass is a fuel created from organic matter, such as food waste and construction and demolition (C&D) waste. The City has a long tradition of using biomass at its wastewater treatment plants by harnessing methane gas produced during the treatment process and using it to produce electricity and heat for use on-site. However, transition - ing from natural gas to biomass throughout New York City would require a major new supply chain in the re - gion. Anaerobic digestion is one option for expanding this supply, which has the potential to play an increas - ingly prominent role in helping to divert the landfilling of organic waste while also creating a low carbon source of energy (see Waste chapter). Smart grids. Utilities are adapting to increased installa - tions of DERs, but these resources create new technical and economic challenges. Utilities must rethink their business models and introduce a new set of technologies to enable the transition to an electric grid with greater penetration of DERs, including smart grid technologies. Smart grid technologies use communications, remote control, and automation software to enhance reliability and energy efficiency of the electric grid and to integrate a growing proportion of DERs. Smart grid technologies include smart meters, controls, computers, and equip - ment that enable utilities to quickly scale up or scale back power output to address real-time swings in elec - tric supply and demand.2 By providing two-way commu - nication between the utility and its customers, this also allows customers to reduce energy use when it is most beneficial, such as during times of peak energy demand when prices are highest. The emergence of smart grid technologies helps grid operators to better match supply with demand and manage power quality, resulting in a more flexible, efficient, and reliable grid. Another key to integrating renewable energy into the electric grid will be enhancing the flexibility of existing generators to meet changes in electric demand. Many fossil-fuel based generators have a minimum genera - tion level and are unable to increase or decrease output quickly enough to match potentially rapid shifts in re - newable generation. Fast-ramping natural gas genera - tors, such as combustion turbines, are designed to start and stop quickly. Improving the efficiency of these gen - erators and linking them with dispatchable renewable energy, energy storage, and smart grid technologies is a key component of a more flexible grid that can incor - porate large-scale renewable energy sources and DERs. 80 x 50 Roadmap: Energy Achieving 80 x 50 will require aggressive action on all fronts. Based on the City's analysis, the New York State electric generation mix will need to move beyond the BAU grid to become 70 to 80 percent renewable. This will include significant volumes of offshore wind, ex - pansive land-side solar and wind installations, hydro - power, and new transmission that will allow access to these renewable energy sources from outside the city. This is in line with the City's low carbon intensity grid scenario, and is increasingly feasible as renewable ener - gy sources become more economically viable and as a 42 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycEnergyUnderstanding and Prioritizing the Potential of Community Energy New York City cannot reach 80 x 50 without community energy solutions. Deploying electricity and heating resources at a community scale also creates opportunities to advance growth, equity, sustainability, and resiliency. Specifically, the deployment of energy resources can create local jobs and strengthen local businesses, potentially reduce energy costs, contribute to cleaner air quality and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and help communities and buildings keep the lights on during a power outage. The City conducted a geospatial analysis to inform priority areas where the City can support the deployment of community energy resources. The study identified the feasibility of implementing a range of technologies to meet demand and reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the community scale, including combined heat and power (CHP), ground source heat pumps, water source heat pumps, combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP), wind, solar, and heat recovery. These technologies deliver power, heating and cooling to buildings through district heating and cooling networks and microgrids (Refer to Community Energy Solutions call out box). District heating and cooling networks consist of pipes in the ground connected to energy sources that can provide heating and cooling needs to more than one building. A microgrid connects more than one building to one or more power sources. With the appropriate controls and design, buildings connected to the microgrid can maintain power even when isolated from the utility grid. These platforms for energy delivery can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by taking advantage of renewable sources locally and avoid energy that is lost in the delivery of energy from large-scale centralized systems. The community energy analysis evaluated the technical potential of each technology and their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To better understand which locations in the city would most benefit from these installations beyond greenhouse gas emission reductions, the City overlaid several other parameters to this analysis, including climate risks and environmental and economic factors at the community district level. This work is ongoing and additional data will be integrated into the analysis going forward. Distributed energy resources can achieve goals that both mitigate emissions and advance objectives across growth, equity, sustainability and resiliency. Approach and Sample Outputs As a first step, the City mapped current demands for heating, cooling, and power across the city in order to match up potential new supply with existing needs to identify opportunities for district heating and cooling systems that could capture economies and efficiencies of scale. This map shows heating demand at the block level across the City. The demand for heating, cooling, and power is greatest in areas of the city with a high density of buildings, which includes much of the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. While building density provides assurance that there is sufficient energy and heating and cooling demand for a local district system (e.g., as described above and please also refer to Community Energy Solutions call out box), it leaves limited space for the installation of some distributed energy resources. Once heating, cooling and power demand was examined, the analysis assessed the energy supply potential of different distributed heating, cooling and power technologies, Heat Demand Density (kbtu/sf/yr) <50 50 to 100 100 to 150 150 to 200 >200 Technical Potential for Solar PV (annual MWh) < 5,000 5,000 - 10,000 10,000 - 20,000 20,000 - 40,000 > 40,000 Data source: City University of New York - New York Solar Map including solar PV, solar thermal, wind, combined heat and power systems, combined cooling, heating and power systems, and heat pumps (water source and ground source) at the block level. Technologies were prioritized based on their emissions reduction potential. The map above focuses on one type of technology\u2014solar PV\u2014and shows that there is clear potential for solar PV across the five boroughs. In addition to assessing the technical supply potential, understanding which communities are most vulnerable to climate risks and high energy costs helps inform where the 43 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Energy Relevant Projects Developing a district heating system and microgrid for the NYCHA Red Hook East Houses and Red Hook West Houses. To meet heating needs and provide energy resiliency benefits to over 6,250 residents, many of whom are elderly, disabled, or children, across 28 buildings and 2,873 apartments, NYCHA issued an RFP in June 2016 for the development of a district heating system and resilient microgrid for its Red Hook Houses. The eight existing steam plants, which provide heat to these residents, were severely damaged by flooding from Sandy, and the buildings are currently receiving heat and hot water from temporary boilers. NYCHA hopes to enter contract negotiations by end of 2016. Piloting an energy resiliency project for the Hunts Point in Southeast Bronx. Home to a strong residential community and a major industrial job hub for food distribution, Hunts Point is vulnerable to infrastructure outages and flooding. The Hunts Point Resiliency Project will result in the implementation of an energy pilot project that will enhance the resiliency of the area and decrease its vulnerability to extended power outages. Guided by an extensive stakeholder engagement process that includes over 45 local community organizations, businesses, residents, and elected officials, the project aims to build resiliency, strengthen the community, and provide workforce opportunities in the peninsula. Energy Affordability, Heat Risk, and Air Quality Least Vulnerable Most Vulnerable Critical Facilitiesdeployment of community energy solutions can provide the broadest set of co-benefits in terms of equitable economic development, sustainability and resiliency. This map above shows the results\u2014at a community district level\u2014of a composite risk index made up of three different factors that community energy projects may help address: energy affordability, air quality, and heat risk. The City is also examining individual risk indicators and how they overlap with each other.3 These analyses are ongoing and will help inform where the City will prioritize its facilitation efforts for community energy projects, including bringing together community non-profits, project developers, financing and funding entities and state and federal partners. This map shows that the east Bronx and central Brooklyn are priority areas for community energy. The map above identifies potential critical facilities ranging or backup power at these types of facilities if feasible. This map zooms in on neighborhoods in Central Brooklyn which host a variety of different potential critical facilities that could be candidates for inclusion in a potential community energy project. from City-owned assets such as firehouses, police stations and schools, to community-based critical facilities such as cooling centers and shelters. Churches and community centers can also serve as community-defined critical facilities, by providing important services to vulnerable populations during an outage and/or serving as a designated place to shelter during an extreme weather or evacuation event. Community energy projects should seek to include alternate Places of Public Assembly Healthcare Congregate Housing Public Safety and Infrastructure Gas Station44 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycEnergyresult of both policy decisions and technological inno - vation. Deploying these resources for New York City's grid will also require adequate transmission capacity to the city. Reducing demand on the electric grid by maximizing energy efficiency in buildings, scaling up distributed solar PV, and installing energy storage would increase the ability to meet energy demand with renewable en - ergy sources. At the same time, we must also shift away from fossil fuels for heating, cooling, and hot water production in buildings. When combined with efficien - cy improvements, transitioning these systems to high efficiency electric technologies, such as air source or ground source heat pumps, could achieve significant GHG reductions by tapping into a clean future electric grid (see Buildings chapter). Similarly, transitioning to electric vehicles will contribute further GHG reductions by reducing the use of petroleum in on-road vehicles (see Transportation chapter). The City can also deploy low-carbon district heating and cooling networks at strategic locations to reduce energy consumption and provide resiliency benefits by capturing wasted heat from power plants, substations, and building cooling systems and installing district-scale ground source and water source heat pumps. To better understand the opportunities for supplying local energy sources, the City is developing a Commu - nity Energy Map to analyze the technical potential of a range of distributed energy resources throughout all five boroughs of the city, block by block. The Commu - nity Energy Map will consider the current demands for heating, cooling, and power across different building ty - pologies, the physical characteristics of each block, the technical potential for several technology types, and the business case for these technologies. The analysis will further prioritize opportunities based on their potential for GHG reductions and several geographically-based indicators of social vulnerability. The analysis found that CHP is a promising technology for community energy today because its beneficial use of waste heat from electricity generation makes it eco - nomical and reduces GHG emissions relative to the cur - rent electric grid. However, when paired with the City's low carbon intensity grid scenario, natural gas-fired CHP will cease to provide a GHG reduction benefit. Still, CHP is an important part of the 80 x 50 roadmap because it can be the primary source of heat for district heating networks in the near term. In the long run, nat - ural gas CHP could transition to renewable fuel sourc - es or be phased out in favor of low-carbon heat sources such as biogas to reduce GHG emissions. This strategy allows CHP to play an important role in establishing dis - trict heating and cooling networks in New York City that will ultimately be necessary to achieve 80 x 50. Challenges to address While the adoption of DERs bears promise for the City's GHG reduction, air quality, and resiliency goals, high lev - els of DER adoption are hampered by regulatory, techni - cal, and financial challenges. DERs are subject to various permitting and interconnection requirements that can add time and expense to project planning. Once com - pleted, the value proposition for several types of DERs Other (ker osene , biomass , (solar wind , hydro) Nuclear Fossil (na tural Fuel Mix by Scenario45 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Energydepends on factors such as the compensation received from utilities for energy that is not consumed on-site, but is rather exported to the grid (currently governed by a \"net metering\" tariff that allows on-site energy production to offset energy consumption) and the cost of maintaining utility service as a backup to the DER when it is out of service (known as a \"standby tariff\"). With State-level regulatory activities taking these tar - iffs under review as part of REV, there is an opportunity for the City and others to advocate for the more holistic valuation of the benefits DERs provide to the grid, the environment, and society. Failure to adjust these tariffs to recognize the full value they provide will continue to hinder significant DER uptake. Given the above hurdles to DER adoption in addition to space constraints, the City will need to look beyond its own borders for the provision of large-scale renewables. While the high density of New York City's built environ - ment is conducive to public transit and provides oppor - tunities for community energy solutions, it also means that the city has little available land for large-scale re - newables. With the exception of the Bronx, New York City is a city of islands, meaning that there are a limited number of transmission lines that connect the city to the regional electric grid, which has greater access to land and natural resources for large-scale renewables. Much like other infrastructure investments, adding new trans - mission capacity will require major capital investments and years to develop. Still, the City can engage the State and the New York Independent System Operator (NY - ISO) regarding the need for transmission investments to bring economic renewables from upstate into New York City. Policies that are set at the state, regional, and federal lev - el are the main drivers of future GHG reductions from the electric grid. Statewide policies are helping to in - crease the role of renewable energy in the grid mix, but additional regulatory changes are necessary to support market conditions for existing power plants to transition to cleaner, more flexible technologies that support a re - newables-based grid. The lack of direct City control over its electricity supply makes it more critical for the City to leverage its purchasing power where possible to in - vest in renewable energy resources. State and regional entities have also helped to address economic challenges to low-carbon electricity gener - ation through RGGI, which is an interstate emissions trading scheme among northeastern states that places a cost on GHG emissions from power plants. Putting a price on carbon allows market forces to drive down de - mand for high-carbon fossil fuels and make renewable energy more economically competitive, although cur - rent prices still do not reflect the true cost to society from the environmental and public health impacts associated with GHG emissions and emissions of criteria pollutants, including particulate matter, ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead, and as a result, have not had a significant impact on the market. More - over, our modeling indicates that more electricity will be imported from outside the RGGI-participating states by 2050. Accordingly, the City must advocate for state, regional, and federal policies that better reflect the so - cial costs of energy production to ensure future supplies come from clean and renewable sources. The price of natural gas can also partly determine the feasibility of a sufficiently renewables-based grid to achieve 80 x 50. Natural gas prices have been relative - ly low in recent years due to an increase in supply ex -Carbon Intensity of District Heating Sources (tCO 2e/MMBtu) 0.000.010.020.030.040.050.060.07 2050 2030 2014Carbon Intensity of District Heating Sour ces (tCO2e/MMBtu)High Efciency Gas Boiler (Building Scale) Natural Gas CHP Ground Source Heat Pump Air Source Heat Pump Substation Heat Recovery Power Plant Heat Recovery Building System Heat Recovery46 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycEnergyplained in part by the widescale use of hydraulic frac - turing, or \"fracking,\" to extract natural gas from shale formations. Fracking is a controversial method of nat - ural gas extraction, with opponents pointing to adverse effects on local water quality among other impacts. The transition from oil and coal to natural gas, which burns cleaner than other fossil fuels, has contributed to lower GHG emissions to date in power plants. However, sus - tained low natural gas prices could increase our reliance on gas and delay the uptake of large-scale renewables. The transition to a renewables-based grid will also heighten challenges of intermittency. In order to pro - vide reliable service, the grid will need to become in - creasingly flexible, incorporating energy from central - ized or decentralized plants that can ramp up and down quickly. This will need to be combined with utility-scale storage to respond to the daily fluctuations of solar and wind generation. Making this transition will require technological solutions as well as price signals that pro - vide incentives for supply balancing resources and load management. Simultaneously, as building systems and vehicles shift from heating fuels and petroleum to efficient, elec - tric-based technologies, increased electricity demand may affect grid performance and resiliency as we be - come more dependent on the grid to support more of our daily activities. An increased dependence on reliable electricity, coupled with increasingly intermittent sup - ply to the electric grid, make it imperative that decisive steps are taken to develop the necessary market and reg - ulatory environment to enable emerging grid manage - ment technologies to flourish. Near-term actions to reduce GHG emissions Increase direct and indirect investments in large- scale renewable energy and energy storage New large-scale renewable energy systems are one of the most critical investments for achieving 80 x 50. The CES will build upon existing renewables in the state, re - alizing more of the potential for on-land wind turbines and large-scale solar farms upstate. New York City's am - bitious 80 x 50 goal will require going beyond full im - plementation of the CES. This includes fostering a new regional market for offshore wind, similar to those along European coastlines. To help catalyze the market for large-scale renewable energy, in July of 2015, the City issued a Request for Information to identify projects that would meet 100 percent of City government electricity needs from new renewable energy while maintaining reliability and af - fordability. After responses were received in September 2015, and no single project met all of the requirements. The City has met with various respondents and other stakeholders, including project developers, regulatory agencies, utilities, and environmental advocates, to ex - plore options in greater detail and to identify opportuni - ties to further spur private-sector investment. From these collaborations, the City has identified sever - al near-term opportunities and continues to work with a broad base of stakeholders to accelerate and ensure longer-term opportunities have the greatest potential to be realized. The City is engaged in discussions with offshore wind developers on ways the City could facili - tate the development of this resource around the metro area. This will signal the City's interest in offshore wind, help attract components of the supply chain to the local area and boost economic activity, and provide valuable lessons for larger offshore wind farms off of New York City that are further out on the horizon. In addition, the City has been speaking with a number of developers who are looking to bring larger volumes of renewable energy from outside of New York City into the local system via high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission lines. These types of projects have the abil - ity to tap into numerous renewable energy technologies, including solar, land-based wind, and hydroelectric pow - er, in locations that are more suitable to their develop - ment and transmit the energy long distances, often un - derground, with less energy lost along the way. Along with GHG emission reductions, future offshore wind farms along with underground HVDC lines that connect directly into the local grid afford New York City an increased level of reliability and resiliency that will help keep the power on and restore it more quickly when there are major interruptions from natural or human in - duced events. They also bring the added benefit of re - ducing reliance on older, less efficient in-city generators, resulting in improved air quality and public health. The City will continue to assess how it can leverage its pur - chasing power and work with utilities, regulators, trans - mission owners, grid operators, generators, environmen - tal advocates and developers to bring about legislative and rule changes that will facilitate the delivery of 70 to 80 percent of the citywide electrical load from renewable 47 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Energyenergy sources. Increase efficiency and emissions requirements for in-city generators The in-city generation stock is expected to transition from providing roughly 50 percent of generation today to less than one-third in 2050. It will need to play a sup - porting role to the renewables-based grid, shoring up the reliability of electricity supply within the five boroughs. The City will continue to support the repowering or re - placement of the most inefficient power plants. Those remaining will need to be efficient natural gas turbines that can ramp up and down quickly to complement the ebb and flow of a grid highly reliant on intermittent re - newable energy resources. The City will work with the New York State Public Ser - vice Commission (PSC) to create a long-term vision for the future of the grid and will advocate for NYISO to develop standards that will guide this transition. One such example is the development of a ramping tariff that would allow NYISO to procure ramping capability to ad - dress the intermittency challenges associated with a re - newables-based grid. The City will continue to play an active role in NYISO discussions that impact the invest - ments in and operations of in-city generators. We will also advocate for investment in programs and products that improve grid flexibility and ensure power quality. The City will pursue the expansion of the transmission network that connects the city to the regional grid, in order to access clean regional resources and reduce the need for in-city generating capacity to satisfy the city's reliability requirement. In turn, this will facilitate the re - tirement of older, less efficient plants and reduce costs for ratepayers in the long run. The City will also support measures to expand the in-city transmission and distri - bution network to address acute stresses, such as local transmission constraints near load pockets, in order to further decrease reliance on in-city generators. Make an unprecedented commitment to promote clean, distributed energy resources DERs, including rooftop and community solar, energy ef - ficiency, and energy storage, will play an important role in increasing the amount of clean energy in the city, es - pecially in the near term. They also play a critical role in reducing demand on the grid and providing resiliency benefits. Therefore, building on efforts over the last few years, the City is bolstering its commitment to support their deployment. Community energy solutions can support both climate mitigation and adaptation needs. The development of the Community Energy Map allows the City and project developers to identify which locations provide the op - portunities to both reduce GHG emissions and enhance the resiliency of vulnerable neighborhoods with com - munity energy systems. In addition to evaluating the technical potential of dif - ferent distributed generation sources, the Community Energy Map incorporates dimensions of climate change vulnerability\u2014including energy affordability, air quality, heat risk, and flood risk\u2014so that investments in clean, resilient energy investments can be prioritized to ad - dress these challenges. The findings from this analysis could facilitate potential partnerships for community energy projects. The City will explore developing the map into an online resource that will help communities and project developers identify potential sites for com - munity energy projects. The City can lead by example by deploying DERs on our own buildings and can leverage our own assets to foster community energy solutions. The City owns thousands of public facilities, including 14 wastewater treatment plants, throughout the five boroughs, and has commit - ted to retrofit every municipal building with significant energy use to improve energy efficiency and to install 100 MW of distributed solar energy on City-owned property by 2025 (see Buildings chapter). NYCHA has an additional 328 developments and has committed to reduce energy intensity per square foot from these prop - erties by 20 percent by 2025 though energy efficiency upgrades and the development of 25 MW of renewable energy capacity by the same year. From hospitals and office buildings to neighborhood schools and libraries, larger public facilities offer an opportunity to serve as host sites or power and heat - ing off-takers for community-scale energy projects. As densely developed as the city is, there are opportunities to consider brownfields, landfills, other open spaces, and public rights-of-way for community-scale energy resources. The Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) already identifies any City-owned prop - erties that may be candidates for rooftop solar. DCAS is now exploring the expansion of this program to identify vacant City properties that could be used to host com - munity shared solar arrays. The City will explore ways to facilitate the beneficial use of such sites through a vari - ety of mechanisms, such as through low- or no-cost land 48 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycEnergyleases. To promote greater penetration of DERs, the City is working to address regulatory and market barriers to deployment. \"Soft\" costs due to permitting and inter - connection requirements have impeded the growth of building- and community-scale DERs. The City is active - ly engaged in reviewing regulatory barriers and encour - aging modifications to existing utility tariffs to support their more efficient deployment. For example, the City has continually advocated for changes to utility standby rates, which are designed to recover the utility's costs of \"standing by\" with a reliable supply of power in the event that a DG unit fails and the customer requires full elec - tricity supply from the utility grid. The City has successfully advocated for modifications to existing standby rates to make them more attractive for DG project developers. Examples include encouraging the PSC to create a \"campus-style\" standby rate that al - lows a customer to offset load at multiple buildings from a single DG unit. The City also successfully argued for an incentive for standby customers that rewards DG units for reliable performance and petitioned for modifica - tions to the steam standby rates to reduce onerous steam standby charges that can make DG project economics challenging. The City has also played a key role in shaping discus - sions around net metering, which has been a critical driver in smaller-scale DG development throughout the City. The City is actively participating in the statewide effort to develop a successor tariff to net metering with the objective of encouraging significant new investment in renewable energy over the next several years. In ad - dition, the City has been a leading proponent for com - munity DG, which, through projects such as community shared solar arrays, is designed to extend the benefits of smaller-scale DG to a much greater number of partici - pants\u2014particularly customer segments like low-to-mod - erate income customers that have been historically un - derserved by renewable energy development. The City recently joined a coalition of solar industry and environ - mental advocates in petitioning the PSC to remove, for certain building arrangements, the 10-member require - ment currently in the community DG rules, with the goal of expanding opportunities for on-site community DG to the many smaller, multifamily buildings located throughout New York City. Furthermore, the City has been an active voice in reforms to utility interconnection procedures, which are routine - ly cited as one of the largest barriers to increased DG de - ployment. As a result, the City advocated for changes to New York's standardized interconnection requirements that are designed to, among other things: (1) expedite the interconnection process for projects that will have min - imal impact on the utility grid; (2) reduce the upfront costs that project developers are required to bear; and (3) expand the project size limit (from 2 MW to 5 MW) for eligibility under standardized interconnection treat - ment. In addition, the City is a participant in the PSC's ongoing Interconnection Policy Working Group, which is tasked with identifying and resolving major barriers to DG interconnection with the utility grid, such as un - certain allocation among developers of required utility upgrade costs. All of these efforts are designed to reduce the time and expense associated with utility intercon - nection, while ensuring that interconnections continue to be completed in a safe and reliable manner. These measures serve to benefit various forms of clean DG and will support the City's ambitious solar deploy - ment goals. In 2014, the City committed to install 100 MW of solar PV capacity on City-owned property by 2025 and to support the development of 250 MW of solar PV on private property by 2025, in part through group purchasing and community shared solar projects. The City is over a third of the way toward achieving its 250 MW private-sector solar target (combining the 69 MW in operation with the 17 MW in development) and on track to be a quarter of the way toward its 100 MW goal by the end of 2018. As we continue progressing towards the OneNYC solar goal, the City is expanding the citywide installation tar - get (for both private and publicly-owned properties) to 1,000 MW by 2030. The City's efforts to streamline the permitting and review process have reduced the average turnaround time for solar PV plan reviews at the Depart - ment of Buildings (DOB) to less than a day (see Build - ings chapter) and provide significant support for this new stretch goal. In addition, this new target builds on the impressive recent growth of the city's solar market, which is projected to continue its upward trajectory, on the strength of emerging technologies and market struc - tures. With over 2,700 solar jobs already in New York City, this expanded solar deployment target solidifies the city's position as a major clean energy jobs hub in the northeast. Through the New York City Solar Partnership, a joint 49 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Energyeffort of the City University of New York (CUNY), the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC), and the Mayor's Office of Sustainability, the City will support programs that accelerate rooftop solar installations and efforts to facilitate community shared solar installations. The Solar Partnership recently launched Solarize NYC, which supports community-led group purchasing campaigns that lower the costs of in - stalling rooftop solar PV, as well as Shared Solar NYC, a program to match developers with rooftop owners that can host large \"shared solar\" installations. Under Shared Solar NYC, rooftop owners can offer subscriptions to shares of the project's energy output to renters and homeowners without suitable roofs. The City is taking additional policy measures to ensure that community shared solar can flourish in New York City, where its ini - tial uptake has lagged relative to other areas of New York State with greater land availability for substantial solar installations. For instance, the City has submitted a joint petition with other stakeholders throughout the state to the PSC to enable small multifamily properties to struc - ture their own community shared solar projects. We are also establishing the city's first-ever energy storage deployment target\u2014100 MWh by 2020. Energy storage can enhance the economic viability of solar PV installations while also helping to manage peak electric - ity demand and provide a resiliency benefit by provid - ing backup power. Energy storage systems also power electric vehicles and can be used to help manage their electricity consumption from the grid in high-voltage charging applications. Battery technology needs a streamlined pathway through regulatory agencies and into the marketplace. CUNY's Smart DG Hub Resilient Solar Project has been coor - dinating this process in partnership with City agencies and utilities. For example, fire safety is a key issue that must be addressed before certain types of energy storage systems, in particular lithium-ion batteries, can become widely deployed. The Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) is actively engaged in an energy storage testing study commissioned by Con Edison and the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to assess safety and suppression measures required for various types of energy storage systems. This work will inform the development of improved permitting guidelines to streamline FDNY's review pro - cess for technologies deemed sufficiently safe in testing. In order to accelerate the safe deployment of emerg - ing technologies, including energy storage systems, the City will make investments to reduce permitting times, develop standards for design and installation of safety measures, and continue to incorporate new technologies into the City's building and fire safety codes. In addition to solar, the City is exploring opportunities to scale up the use of ground source heat pumps. The City is conducting a cost-benefit analysis that includes the social cost of carbon when comparing ground source heat pumps to traditional heating systems for City- owned buildings. The City is also developing a publicly available online screening tool to assess whether ground source heat pumps can be a cost-effective low-carbon solution for providing heating and cooling to both City- owned and private buildings (see Buildings chapter). To encourage the further development and adoption of new and emerging technologies, the City, led by EDC, will continue its support for clean technologies and smart cities entrepreneurs and innovation through the Applied Sciences NYC initiative to build or expand world-class applied sciences and engineering campuses in New York City, and UrbanTech NYC\u2014a comprehen - sive program offering incubation and step-out spaces, prototyping equipment and commercialization pro - gramming, demonstration opportunities, and shared re - Solar installation in NYC Photo credit: NYC Deparment of Citywide Administrative Services 50 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycEnergysources to companies working to solve New York City's urban challenges. Laying the Foundation for the Future The challenge of achieving 80 x 50 goes beyond New York City. Regulatory action is needed at the state, re - gional, and federal levels to enable large-scale renew - ables to become the dominant sources in the electric grid. As technologies evolve and distributed energy re - sources become increasingly cost competitive, the insti - tutional and regulatory framework must evolve to allow for these solutions to be integrated into the energy sup - ply system and to allow for customers to have the ability to play a more active role in determining their energy supply. Public policy must also continue to guide deci - sions made in the private sector in order for the City to achieve its goals\u2014namely, the City will continue to advo - cate at the NYISO and PSC for increased transmission that connects the city directly to other areas in the re - gion that are near large-scale renewable energy produc - tion facilities. Con Edison has implemented interconnection and other infrastructure improvements to support DER integra - tion, enhance the resiliency of the grid, and reduce emis - sions from its steam system. The City will continue to look to Con Edison as a partner in achieving 80 x 50 and will also continue to advocate for utilities to build upon these improvements and accelerate the transformation necessary for a 2050 grid that is renewables-based, af - fordable, and reliable. It takes time for new technologies and business models to mature and become competitive with existing systems. Researchers and project developers must also be able to test and refine the technologies in real-world settings to give them ample opportunity to mature. New York City will continue to foster and support innovation by offer - ing public sites to test new technologies and strategies and encouraging private sites to host pilot projects, such as through the DCAS Innovative Demonstrations for En - ergy Adaptability (IDEA) program (see Buildings chap - ter). The City and NYCEDC will also continue to invest in emerging technologies and private sector innovation for DERs, DG, energy storage, and other opportunities through its joint initiatives. The NYISO and the State will have to continue to lead the way in defining the vision for a renewables-based grid, ensuring the NYISO market structures result in the fleet of in-city generators, energy storage, and smart grid technologies necessary to help balance the grid and ensure reliable service. In terms of DERs, New York State's Reforming the Energy Vision (REV) is laying the groundwork for a transition to future energy systems that feature distributed energy resources more promi - nently, and the City will continue to advocate for utilities to implement REV in a way that allows clean energy to be prioritized based on a variety of social and environ - mental considerations without sacrificing energy reli - ability or resiliency.

We envision that nearly all of our existing buildings will be upgraded to use significantly less energy, and many will have transitioned away from fossil fuels to clean and renewable energy sources. As a result, the air will be cleaner, New Yorkers will have greater control over their energy bills, and residents will have more com - fortable homes\u2014there will no longer be a need to open a window in the dead of winter to cool an overheated apartment. New buildings will be built to the best energy performance standards, and New York City will boast an expanded industry of world class architects, engineers, and contractors who are in high demand locally and globally to design and construct ultra-low energy build - ings. Developers, owners, and residents will have access to a wide array of financial resources and highly quali - fied service providers to design the next generation of new buildings and retrofit existing properties. Building operators and staff, the critical link to maintaining these deep energy reductions, will have the tools and exper - tise to run building systems at the highest level of per - formance, while building tenants and residents will be empowered with smart ways to control energy use and comfort in their spaces. Buildings54 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycAchieving 80 x 50: Buildings New York City has over one million buildings that make up more than five billion square feet of built area. More than 90 percent of these buildings will still exist in 2050. The energy used in the city's diverse building stock is the largest contributor of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, responsible for 68 percent of the citywide total in 2014. 1 Commercial and multifamily buildings make up a ma - jority of built floor area and GHG emissions from energy used in buildings. One- to four-family homes represent the largest number of buildings, but the total built floor area and GHG emissions from these buildings are pro - portionally less. Since 2005, GHG emissions from the energy use in buildings have decreased by 12 percent, even as the city's built area has increased. The decrease is a result of re - duction in GHG emissions from the electricity supply, conversion from heavy heating oil to cleaner fuels, and increased energy efficiency and conservation. Many of the initiatives to reduce GHG emissions from buildings launched to date are aimed at the city's larg - est buildings. Going forward, all buildings will play a role in the path to 80 x 50. New buildings will need to meet ultra-low energy standards, and nearly every existing building will need to implement deep energy retrofits that holistically address heating, cooling, and building envelopes. To realize the full extent of potential GHG re - ductions, buildings must transition away from fossil fuels for certain systems, maximize on-site renewable energy, improve operations and maintenance, and empower res - idents to reduce energy use. Drivers of GHG emissions Fossil fuels that are burned in New York City's build - ings, primarily to produce heat and hot water, account for 60 percent of the GHG emissions from buildings and almost 30 percent of total citywide emissions. Nat - ural gas burned on-site accounts for more than half of building-based energy use and over 45 percent of GHG emissions. The share of heating oil has decreased signifi - cantly since 2005 as a result of the City's efforts to phase out No. 6 and No. 4 fuel oils, but still accounts for 11 per - cent of building-based emissions. Electricity, used mostly for lighting, plug loads, and cooling, accounts for almost 68% Buildings28%Transpor tation4%WasteNew Y ork City GHG Emissions by Sector (2014)New York City GHG Emissions by Sector (2014) GHG Emissions from Large Buildings by End Use (2014) Multifamily Citywide 42% 21%52%15% 4%15%16%9%5%11%11% 20% 22%8%8%15%10% 6% 5% 4%GHG Emissions by End Use (2014) Other Plug LoadsVentilationLightingSpace CoolingDomestic Hot Water Space Heating55 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Buildingsone-third of the energy use and 40 percent of GHG emis - sions from buildings. District stream use in buildings ac - counts for three percent of GHG emissions. The energy used for heating\u2014typically natural gas or heating oil\u2014accounts for more than half of all build - ing-based GHG emissions. In multifamily buildings, the energy used for the combination of heating and do - mestic hot water (DHW) production account for nearly three-quarters of their GHG emissions. In commercial buildings, emissions sources are more evenly distributed across heating, plug loads, and lighting. Business as usual findings In order to understand what it will take to achieve 80 x 50 citywide, the City first modeled projected GHG reduc - tions under a business as usual (BAU) scenario for each sector through 2050. The BAU scenario includes GHG reductions achieved to date and the impacts from pro -jected population growth, existing state and federal poli - cies, and local policies enacted prior to 2014. By 2050, New York City's population is anticipated to grow to nearly 9.2 million people and the city's workforce is estimated to grow to 4.8 million people.2 This growth is expected to result in nearly 100,000 new buildings, which equates to roughly 460 million square feet of new built area. This includes a 12 percent increase in residen - tial and six percent increase in commercial space.3 Under the BAU scenario, total building-based GHG emissions are expected to decrease by 24 percent from 2005 levels by 2050, which is largely due to GHG reduc - tions from the electricity supply, fuel switching away from heavy heating oil, and efficiency improvements in buildings as a result of previously enacted policies.4 Existing buildings continue to be the largest contributor of GHG emissions, representing over 90 percent of the total built square footage and building-based emissions. New building growth is expected to increase these emis - sions by nine percent. GHG emissions from on-site natural gas and heating oil use are expected to remain roughly constant from to - day's levels. As our electricity supply becomes cleaner, fossil fuel-based energy sources will account for a larger proportion of building-based GHG emissions, increasing from roughly half of building-based emissions in 2005 to over two-thirds in 2050. Emerging Trends The future electric grid. The potential for significant reductions in building-based GHG emissions depends largely on the carbon intensity of the electricity supply, or the amount of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted per unit of energy. If future electricity generation is domi - nated by fossil fuel-based power plants, the GHG emis - sions associated with electricity use in buildings will be higher than in a scenario in which renewable energy plays a major role in the electricity supply. Therefore, ef - forts to green the electric grid are essential to achieving significant GHG reductions from buildings. Community-scale energy. Distributed renewable en - ergy located on-site in buildings or as part of communi - ty-scale energy systems will reduce building-based GHG emissions. The largest potential for distributed renew - able energy comes from solar PV installed on building rooftops. The technical potential for on-site solar in New York City is increasing as technologies advance, efficien -Projected Growth in Built Area by Building Use 2010- 2050 (millions of square feet) Institutional IndustrialCommercial Multifamily 1 to 4 FamilyProjected Growth in Built Area by Building Use 2010-2050 (in million square feet) 2010 2050+460 Million Square Feet 1,3901,5201,9402,2109701,120310250510560Buildings56 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycBuildings Contribution to Business as Usual Scenario (2005-2050) 2005 Baseline2014Citywide 80x50 Target 11.8 8 - 9 2050 Buildings TargetAdditional GHG reduction needed to reach 2050 Buildings Target40.6 -12%+8% -5% -10% 2050 Electricity Other FuelsGrowth from new buildingsGreener Greater Buildings PlanClean Heat RegulationsEnergy Code All percent reductions are relative to the 2005 Buildings emissions baselineBAU electric grid (2014-2050)Reduction from pre-2014 policies -2%-2%Buildings Business as Usual Scenario 2005-2050, in Million Metric Tons in Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO 2e) Buildings Business as Usual Scenario by 2e) Natural Gas No. 2 Fuel OilNo. 4 Fuel OilNo. 6 Fuel OilDistrict SteamBusiness as Usual GHG Emissions in MtCO 2e: Buildings 3057 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Buildingscies improve, and as the City, State, and federal govern - ment work to remove regulatory barriers. The City also assessed district heating and cooling op - tions, including solar thermal, combined heat and power (CHP), combined cooling heat and power (CCHP), wind, ground source heat pumps (GSHP), water source heat pumps (WSHP), and heat recovery (see Energy chapter). New York City is already home to Con Edison's district steam system, the nation's largest district heating net - work. These localized energy solutions hold the poten - tial to meet clean energy demand and to provide health and resiliency benefits. Energy efficiency. Improving energy efficiency of buildings will continue to be the most important strate - gy to reduce building-based GHG emissions even as the electric grid becomes cleaner. Many of today's buildings use more electricity for equipment, cooling, and plug loads than ever before, but the on-site energy used for heating and hot water production will continue to be the major driver of the city's building-based emissions. To identify opportunities to transform the building stock for a low-carbon future, Mayor de Blasio convened the Buildings Technical Working Group (TWG) in 2015. The TWG analyzed nearly 100 low- and medium-diffi - culty energy conservation measures (ECMs) in existing buildings (typically with paybacks of 10 years or less) and found that these measures could reduce current build - ing-based GHG emissions by up to 33 percent. Imple -menting these measures would lead to $2.7 billion in en - ergy cost savings and 15,000 direct construction-related jobs. Deep energy retrofit strategies. The TWG also ana - lyzed deep energy retrofit strategies that holistically ad - dress heating systems, cooling systems, and the building envelope. The analysis showed that deep energy retrofits could achieve energy reductions of 40-60 percent in typ - ical New York City buildings using existing technologies. At a minimum, these deep energy retrofits include repair - ing or replacing heating distribution systems, upgrading heating equipment to higher efficiency models, properly sizing equipment to building energy loads, and install - ing better controls and sensors. These measures must be paired with improvements to the building envelope, which includes improved insulation and air tightness, in order to realize their full potential. For some buildings, this will require reconfiguring room air conditioning or installing central cooling systems or mini-splits for com - bined heating and cooling to reduce through-wall and Potential GHG Reductions from Low- x 08 cyneno/vog.cynBuildings TWG ECMs within the 2016 Energy CodeDecr ease window u-values for punched openings Increase wall insulation for one- to four-family homes Replace PT AC units with those with a higher ener gy efciency rating Install an envir onmental monitoring systems for tenant HV AC equipment Install A/C and lighting contr ols in dormitories and hotelsReduce lighting power density and improve lighting contr ols Air seal one- to four -family homes ECMs Identi ed for Immediate ActionSeal r oof vents in elevator shafts Install digital contr ols for boilers Install thermal de-stratication fans in heated industrial spaces Impr ove tenant lighting contr ols Expand LL88 to r esidential building common ar eas Upgrade exterior lighting to curr ent Energy Code standar ds Restrict open r efrigerators in r etail stores ECMs to be Incorporated into Local Law 87 Requir ementsCompr ehensive upgrade for one-pipe steam heating distribution system Compr ehensive upgrade for t wo-pipe steam heating distribution system Compr ehensive upgrade for PT AC distribution systemTechnical Working Group ECMs Underway58 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc On-Site Building Heat Pump Systems Air source and ground source heat pump systems represent two promising opportuni - ties to reduce GHG emissions from buildings and tap into a cleaner future grid. Air source heat pumps are essentially high efficiency air conditioning systems that are able to run in reverse to provide heat during the winter. These systems use electrici - ty to extract heat from cold outdoor air to heat buildings, and extract heat from indoor spaces to meet cooling needs in the sum - mer. By providing cooling without large win - dow or wall penetrations, heat pump sys - tems also reduce energy waste associated with air leaks around traditional window or through-wall air conditioning units.Modern centralized air source heat pump systems are often referred to as Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) systems, which have the ability to modulate and meet a building's heating and cooling needs to different zones within a building. Decentralized air source heat pump models, called \"mini-splits,\" allow a single outdoor unit to be connected to multiple in - door units in several rooms. Current air source heat pump technologies may need supplemental heating on days when the temperature drops below zero, al - though the technology is improving.16 Ground source heat pumps use the relatively sta - ble temperature of the earth to provide heating and cooling. On-site ground source heat pump systems consist of a heat pump installed within the building and a ground coupling system that consists of pip - ing or wells to transfer heat to and from the ground. Ground source heat pumps can be more efficient than air source heat pumps when the outdoor air temperature is very hot or cold, although implemen - tation can be disruptive in a dense urban environ - ment and land availability may limit their feasibility.17 For heat pump systems that use refrigerants, it is important that they are properly operated and maintained to avoid leakage of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are common refrigerants, and the as - sociated fugitive GHG emissions. Federal and inter - national efforts are underway to phase out the use of HFCs in support of refrigerant alternatives.18 window penetrations that lead to air leakage. These sys - tems must be consistently maintained to sustain energy reductions, and tenants and residents must also be em - powered to reduce their energy use. Many of the retrofit paths would be costly today, but replicability could lead to cost reductions. Testing these modeled strategies in real buildings will be critical. Transitioning away from fossil fuels in buildings. As part of the analysis, the TWG explored options to transi - tion from fossil-fuel based heating, cooling, and hot wa - ter systems to renewable energy sources. High efficiency electric technologies for heating, cooling, and hot wa - ter production, such as air source heat pumps (ASHPs) paired with variable refrigerant flow (VRF) or mini-splits, would benefit from a future renewables-based electric grid. The TWG found that even with today's electric grid, the deep energy retrofit strategies that include these high efficiency electric technologies and building envelope improvements currently reduce GHG emissions. Citywide electricity use could increase mod - erately as a result of the use of efficient electric heating technologies and the adoption of electric vehicles, but this would not significantly impact the carbon intensity of the city's electricity supply (see Energy chapter). On-site combined heat and power (CHP) systems co - generate electricity and useful heat. While these systems realize significant efficiencies, they typically rely on the combustion of fossil fuels, most often natural gas.

Biofuels. Biofuels are types of fuels that are sourced from natural materials, such as agricultural waste or anaerobic digestion of wastewater. Biodiesel is a type of biofuel that is made from a variety of resources includ - ing agricultural residue, recycled cooking oil, and animal fats, and can be used in place of heating oil. Biodiesel reduces the on-site GHG emissions from heating oil use in a building, and is estimated to reduce lifecycle5 GHG emissions by 50 to 80 percent relative to the heating oil it replaces.6,7 Currently, all heating oil used in New York City buildings is a minimum two percent biodiesel blend (B2). For buildings that already use fuel oil, switching to biodiesel blends of up to 20 percent (B20) would reduce GHG emissions and can be achieved in existing building systems with little to no equipment modification.8 Bio - diesel blends greater than 20 percent have the potential to further reduce emissions, but introduce potential re - liability challenges with equipment manufactured today and supply chain constraints based on current produc - tion levels. Expanding local and sustainable sourcing of biodiesel inputs from city waste streams could be a promising opportunity to increase the supply of biodies - el while reducing waste and recovering resources such as recycled cooking oil, trap grease, and animal fats. Biogas, which is methane recovered from organic waste streams, could be another opportunity to reduce GHG emissions. Natural gas-dependent systems, including CHP systems, would benefit from sourcing renewable fuels such as biogas. The City is working to optimize the production, collection, and use of biogas at in-city wastewater treatment plants. The City is also seeking to support small scale anaerobic digestion to both increase the production of renewable energy and the capacity to process organics citywide (see Waste chapter). Demand management. Demand management strat - egies in buildings include energy efficiency, demand response (in which energy use is curtailed during peak electricity demand), and energy storage (in which ener - gy is produced during off-peak hours and stored in bat - teries or ice storage for later use). These strategies serve to manage total energy consumption and peak electricity demand and are an increasingly important component of GHG reduction strategies for buildings. Annual peak demand is expected to grow throughout New York State, although the estimated rate of growth has been declin -ing as a result of increased energy efficiency and on-site renewable energy generation.9 Demand management strategies can also reduce electricity demand charges and provide resiliency benefits to building occupants. High efficiency electric heating and cooling can support efficient operations of the electric grid. Annual electric peak demand in New York City currently takes place in summer months. By using these technologies to increase winter electric loads and decrease summer electric loads, the annual load curve will be more level, allowing for more efficient and less costly electricity supply through - out the year. Holistic energy performance design. New buildings have a critical role to play to reduce GHG emissions. The buildings that are constructed today will still be here in 2050. Requiring new and substantially renovated build - ings to meet the highest possible energy performance standards will prevent the need for future retrofits in these buildings.10 The City has made incremental up - dates to the Energy Code that have improved the energy efficiency of our new and substantially renovated build - ings. However, continuing these improvements at the same rate will eventually encounter diminishing returns for energy and GHG reductions. A more cost-effective approach would require a paradigm shift towards design for holistic energy performance. The incremental approach to updating the Energy Code increases efficiency requirements on a system-by-system level. A \"performance-based\" approach considers the whole building as an integrated system. Whole build - ing design standards that set a low-energy performance target, for example an energy use intensity (EUI) per square foot, can achieve significantly greater energy re - ductions than incremental Code updates and allow for greater design flexibility. This typically results in very well-insulated buildings that have minimal air leakage and are heated, cooled, and ventilated with very little energy.11 Moreover, implementing a performance-based Energy Code would benefit efforts to implement deep energy retrofits in the city's existing building stock as new technologies and strategies emerge to achieve ho - listic energy performance and design professionals and contractors develop new skills. 80 x 50 Roadmap: Buildings To reach 80 x 50, GHG emissions from buildings must be reduced from more than 35 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO 2e) in 2014 to between eight Buildings60 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycBuildings Trajectory to 40 x 30 with Current Policies 2005-2030 (MtCO 2e) * Assumes a 50% reduction from ASHRAE 2013 standards for new construction and substantial renovations implemented in 2017 for public buildings and 2022 for private buildings21-25 2030 Buildings TargetBuildings Trajectory to 40 x 30 with Current Policies (2005-2030) 2005 Baseline2014 2030 Electricity Other FuelsGrowth from new buildings TWG actions for Existing Buildings:2016 Energy Code, LL87 steam system requirements, and ECM requirementsReductions from primary BAU electric gridPre-2014policies One City: Built to Last initiativesNextGen -1% -6% -1%-10%+3% All percent reductions are relative to the 2005 Buildings emissions baselineCitywide 80x50 Target 11.8 Net Zero Passive House50% below NYC median (Basis of LL31)ASHRAE 90.1 - 2013(Basis of 2016 NYC Energy Code)ASHRAE 90.1 2010(Basis of 2014 NYC Energy Code)NYC Existing MedianCommercial MultifamilyBasis for Current Standard Basis for Current Standard191211206 96 42121125114 61 38 0 0 Potential GHG Reductions from a Performance-Based Energy Code (Energy Use Intensity in kbtu/sq.ft.)Potential GHG Reductions from a Performance-Based Energy Code (Energy Use Intensity in kbtu/sq.ft.)61 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Buildingsand nine MtCO 2e annually by 2050. This target includes the potential GHG reductions from energy efficiency and clean energy upgrades in buildings, as well as the ex - pected building-based GHG reductions from transition - ing towards a renewables-based electricity supply. Since 2014, the City has launched new policies and pro - grams to reduce GHG emissions through One City: Built to Last (Built to Last) , the City's ten-year plan to im - prove energy efficiency in buildings, and the One City: Built to Last Technical Working Group Report (the TWG Report ). These policies and programs are projected to reduce building-based GHG emissions by 45 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, with GHG reductions from the electric grid expected to account for a large portion of these reductions. Additional projected GHG reductions will come from im - plementing low- and medium-difficulty energy conser - vation measures (ECMs) identified by the TWG, many of which have been incorporated into the 2016 Energy Code. Combined with the City's initiatives across the waste, transportation, and energy supply sectors, these measures will place New York City on track to achieve the interim goal of a 40 percent reduction in citywide GHG emissions by 2030 (40 x 30). Ultimately, low- and medium-difficulty efficiency mea - sures alone will not be sufficient to achieve 80 x 50. Even when combined with the City's low carbon intensity grid scenario (see Energy chapter) and a performance-based Energy Code that achieves a 70 percent reduction in energy use from current standards, implementing all of the low- and medium-difficulty ECMs identified by the TWG results in a projected 56 percent reduction in building-based emissions from 2005 levels. This scenar - io would require buildings to reduce GHG emissions by an additional nine to ten MtCO 2e to achieve the final tar - get of between eight to nine MtCO 2e annually by 2050.

Recognizing the potential to tap into a cleaner future electric grid, these included retrofit strategies that incorporate high efficiency electric tech - nologies for heating paired with building envelope im - provements. The City also analyzed the impacts of a perfor - mance-based energy code that achieves between 50-70 percent reductions from current standards beginning in 2022 for new buildings and substantial renovations. In addition, the City assessed the impacts of wide-scale adoption of up to roughly seven GW of distributed so - lar PV, which includes projected improvements to panel efficiencies, and the introduction of district heating and cooling networks in key areas across the city. The full implementation of these strategies, when com - bined with the City's low carbon intensity grid scenar - io (see Energy chapter), is projected to reduce build - ing-based GHG emissions to roughly eight MtCO2e annually\u2014achieving the GHG reductions that are nec - essary from buildings to meet 80 x 50 at a citywide level. The most significant driver of these reductions is the im - plementation of the deep energy retrofit strategies that holistically address heating, cooling, and the building envelope across all existing buildings in the city. Based on the analysis, between 50 and 60 percent of these buildings must pursue strategies that include a transi - tion to efficient electric technologies for heating sys - tems, tapping into a significantly cleaner future electric grid. Under this scenario, significant solar penetration of roughly seven GW is installed on building rooftops and open lots, and district heating and cooling networks are adopted in key areas of opportunity.

Industry professionals, developers, and contractors across the city must be trained on new design concepts, energy modeling, and construction methods. The City and its partners in the private sector will need to develop and provide proof of concept details and resource libraries for the industry. Many more buildings that are designed to ultra-low energy standards must be constructed and replicated across a broad array of building types, uses, and classes to test new solutions and inform the City's requirements. For existing buildings, New York City has yet to im - plement retrofit strategies that show promise in deliv - ering deep energy reductions on a wide scale. The de - velopment of the TWG deep energy retrofit paths is a significant step, demonstrating that it is possible to re - duce energy use between 40-60 percent in New York 2022 and consume 70 percent less energy than buildings that are constructed today. Challenges to address The technology and strategies that exist today are capa - ble of reducing GHG emissions from buildings to the lev - els that are needed to place the city on a pathway to 80 x 50. To realize this potential, the city must both achieve ultra-low energy performance from new buildings and substantial renovations in the next several years while at the same time facilitating deep energy retrofits in nearly all existing buildings over the longer term. For new and substantially renovated buildings, the most promising opportunity to achieve significant GHG re - ductions is to require holistic energy performance. A small but growing number of buildings in New York City have been constructed to performance standards that significantly reduce energy use and GHG emissions, such as the Passive House standard, which uses 60-70 percent less energy than current standards. These have tended to be smaller buildings, although the new residential tower at Cornell Tech will become the largest Passive House structure in the world once complete. Still, there are a limited number of design professionals and contractors in the city have experience in this type of construction. Residential Tower at Cornell Technion Campus Photo credit: BuroHappold Engineering Brussels Exemplary Buildings Program The City can look to the example of Brus - sels in Belgium as a model for its path for - ward. In 2015, Brussels became the first European city to enact regulations that require all new construction to be built to very-low energy standards following its successful Brussels Exemplary Build - ings Program. The program awarded the design and construction or renovation of nearly 250 very-low energy buildings over six years and trained thousands of design professionals and contractors in best practices drawn from the experi - ence of the awarded buildings to prepare the industry for the new regulations. This accelerated the shift towards holistic en - ergy performance in Brussels' design and construction industry. 64 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycCity buildings, but these strategies will need to be tested in the real world. Buildings must shift away from fossil fuels for heat and hot water production and toward re - newable sources or high efficiency electric technologies and while making improvements to the building enve - lope to reduce heating loads. However, the costs of these improvements remain high and there are few examples in New York City today. These technologies will need to be supported with programs to generate demand and supply chain solutions to help bring down costs. Con - tractors, installers, and building operators will also need to be trained on their installation and use. Additionally, many buildings will need to install on-site renewable en - ergy sources such as solar PV, but costs of these systems can still be out of reach for some New Yorkers, and many buildings have space and shading restraints. Deep energy retrofits and on-site renewable energy in - stallations can reduce energy costs in buildings and im - prove resident comfort, but these upgrades will require investments. Building owners and decision-makers also face competing needs to ensure their buildings are safe, comfortable, and desirable for tenants, which limits the amount of capital that can be spent on energy efficien - cy and clean energy upgrades. Financing can be a major barrier, particularly for those who may lack the capital reserves or creditworthiness to access commercial fi - nancing options, and lending for these projects can re - quire specialized technical analysis, while traditional loan products do not recognize energy savings in the underwriting process. Moreover, the current prices of natural gas and other fossil fuels are inexpensive relative to electricity and renewable sources of energy, which poses a major obstacle to transitioning away from these fuels\u2014although the costs do not take into account the environmental and public health costs associated with the impacts of using fossil fuels. The public and private sector will need to work togeth - er to develop the appropriate financing mechanisms to assist building owners in making energy efficiency and renewable energy investments. The City must also work to help bring down costs through programs to support the market as well as direct financing and incentives for building owners. Building owners will also need clear guidance on options for achieving deep energy savings and incorporating retrofit strategies into long-term capi - tal planning. Moving forward, the City and private sector leaders will need to test the applicability of deep ener - gy retrofit strategies and explore new technologies and solutions that can both ease implementation and lower the potential costs. Some of New York City's buildings will also need to be - come part of community-scale energy systems, such as community shared solar PV or district heating and cool - ing networks (see Energy chapter). Community-scale energy can maximize system efficiencies and has the potential to bring down the costs of energy production. Because of limited space and shading of buildings due to the city's density and other factors, community-scale energy sources can offer greater efficiency and flexibili - ty than building-scale solutions. Still, coordination chal - lenges exist between private building owners and reg - ulatory hurdles will need to be addressed to encourage adoption of these solutions. Another challenge is that tenant energy use makes up a sizeable portion of building energy consumption, and much of it is currently not subject to State or federal regulations. Commercial tenant spaces can account for 40-60 percent or more of a building's overall energy use and present a significant opportunity to reduce GHG emissions. Realizing the opportunities to reduce energy use from commercial tenant spaces would require better alignment between landlords and tenants, while the lack The Dutch Energiesprong Initiative The Energiesprong model in the Nether - lands is an innovative program that has streamlined the retrofit process. In 2010, the Netherlands piloted a competition for local manufacturers to standardize retro - fits for eligible building types to achieve \"Net-Zero Energy\" performance. After several rounds of the competition, En - ergiesprong retrofit packages are now completed in less than 10 days and come with a 30-year energy performance war - ranty. The costs of these retrofits, while still high, have decreased by 40 percent in the last six years. The New York State Energy Resource and Development Au - thority (NYSERDA) is now replicating this program model in New York State to bring these opportunities to the local market. 65 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Buildingsof transparency of energy use information can create a significant obstacle to identifying and implementing efficiency opportunities. The successes of the commer - cial tenants participating in the NYC Carbon Challenge demonstrate that strategies are available and have the potential to be replicated to reduce energy use and GHG emissions from tenant spaces. The full potential for GHG reductions in buildings will also require a workforce that is trained and knowledge - able about energy efficient operations of building sys - tems. Whether a building owner is investing in state of the art technologies or upgrading existing systems to reduce energy costs, the proper installation, operations, and maintenance is essential to achieving optimal ener - gy performance. This will require training thousands of workers on new technologies and construction methods, which would also help bring down potential costs of both new construction and deep energy retrofit strategies. While the challenges to charting the path to 80 x 50 are significant, they are not insurmountable. Over the next three decades, technologies, markets, and State and fed - eral policies will change that will alter the landscape for achieving deep GHG reductions. The City will continue to play an active role to identify and address new and evolving challenges to make the necessary improve - ments to buildings. The City will work closely with the State, federal government, and its private sector part - ners to ensure that new policies are tailored to industry needs and any new requirements provide the industry with time to prepare. As a result of these actions, New Yorkers will enjoy more comfortable living spaces, more productive workspaces, more control over their energy costs, cleaner air, and a more sustainable future. Near-term actions to reduce GHG emissions The City has long been a leader in efforts to reduce GHG emissions from buildings. The building codes have improved sustainability and energy performance. The landmark Greener, Greater Buildings Plan (GGBP) re - quires building owners to make cost-effective efficiency upgrades and provides transparent energy use informa - tion at an unprecedented scale. A mandated phase-out of heavy heating oil use in large buildings has lowered GHG emissions and improved air quality across the city, contributing to the cleanest air that New Yorkers have enjoyed in more than 50 years. The NYC Carbon Challenge has promoted progress with private sector leaders, demonstrating best practices in achieving deep GHG reductions across a range of building types. Mean - while, the City has led by example by implementing en - ergy efficiency retrofits and piloting new technologies across the large portfolio of City-owned and City-oper - ated buildings. These efforts have resulted in reduced GHG emissions from buildings, improved energy effi - ciency, and lower energy costs for New Yorkers. In 2014, with Mayor Bill de Blasio's commitment to 80 x 50, the City released Built to Last , a 10-year plan to cat - alyze the market for energy efficiency and clean energy services and reduce building-based emissions 30 per - cent by 2025. The City also pledged to continue leading by example by committing to retrofit every City-owned building with significant energy use and installing 100 MW of solar power by 2025. Altogether, Built to Last i n- cludes 22 initiatives that the City is now implementing. To identify the steps necessary to place buildings on the pathway to achieving 80 x 50 citywide, the City con - vened the TWG as a group of experts to identify lead - ing edge standards for new construction and substantial renovations and the systems-specific opportunities for existing buildings that are necessary to transform the City's building stock. The TWG also evaluated financial and regulatory structures and assessed the operations, maintenance, and training that are necessary to enable this transformation. In April 2016, the City released the TWG Report , which included additional policies and programs to help place buildings on a pathway to 2050. Building on this progress, the City will pursue the fol - lowing eleven strategies to transform new and existing buildings for a low-carbon future. Implement cost-effective upgrades in existing buildings to improve energy efficiency in the near- term Cost-effective efficiency upgrades in existing buildings today are essential to begin reducing energy use and GHG emissions in the near-term. Buildings owners must install high efficiency equipment at the time of replace - ment and begin implementing other common sense effi - ciency measures to save energy costs quickly. The GGBP requires owners of large buildings over 50,000 square feet in floor area to make common sense upgrades to building systems, including lighting up - grades to meet current codes (Local Law 88 of 2009, or LL88), sub-metering to measure tenant energy use Buildings66 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc(LL88), and retro-commissioning to bring existing ener - gy-using systems to optimal efficiency (Local Law 87 of 2009, or LL87). The GGBP also requires energy and wa - ter use benchmarking (Local Law 84 of 2009, or LL84) and energy auditing to provide energy use transparency (LL87). The City has committed to expanding the GGBP benchmarking, lighting upgrade, and sub-metering re - quirements to owners of mid-sized buildings that are 25,000 to 50,000 square feet in floor area. The City also committed to improving compliance and enforcement of the GGBP laws by enhancing staff capacity at the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB). The City completed the phase-out of No. 6 heavy heating oil in June 2015 and set the deadline for No. 4 oil phase- out by 2030. In addition, the City has enacted more than 50 recommendations from the Green Codes Task Force and 16 recommendations from the Building Resiliency Task Force to improve the city's building codes and in - crease the sustainability and resiliency of our buildings. With the release of the TWG Report in April 2016, the City will implement the most cost-effective efficien - cy measures identified by the TWG as soon as possible through new codes and programs. The TWG found that upgrades to buildings' steam heating distribution sys - tems represent one of the single largest potential reduc - tions in GHG emissions of all cost-effective efficiency measures. As such, the City will enhance the require - ments for retro-commissioning to ensure better heating distribution system performance for large buildings over 50,000 square feet in floor area. The City will also pursue a similar requirement for mid-sized buildings between 25,000 and 50,000 square feet. Finally, recognizing that buildings with federal or State historic designations are exempt from the Energy Code because of New York State law, the City has also commit - ted to tailoring energy standards for appropriate applica - tion to historic buildings. Scale up deep energy retrofits that holistically address heating systems, cooling systems, and building envelopes and transition buildings away from fossil fuels In the long-term, the City will need to develop pathways to implement deep energy retrofits in existing buildings and transition away from fossil fuels. This will include helping building owners and decision-makers to imple - ment these strategies and incorporate them into long- term planning, while working to bring down the poten - tial costs. In the TWG Report, the City committed to requiring large building owners to assess deep energy retrofit strat - egies as part of their required LL87 energy audit through a simple template developed by the City. To facilitate the voluntary adoption of deep energy retrofits, the City will launch a \"High Performance Retrofit Track\" of the NYC Retrofit Accelerator program to assist early adopters as they implement these retrofit strategies. The City will advance efficient electric forms of heating, cooling, and hot water production, such as air source heat pumps with VRF or mini-splits and ground source heat pumps. To develop the market for these technolo - gies, the City is collaborating with other leading U.S. cit - ies, New York State, and manufacturers to educate build - ing owners and remove barriers to installations. In addition, as part of Local Law 6 of 2016, the City's Department of Design and Construction (DDC) is devel - oping a GIS-driven online screening tool to determine feasibility and cost-effectiveness of installing a ground source heat pump system at any location in the city. The tool will be open to the public and will provide relevant data for building owners and developers across the city. Expand distributed solar energy and install 1,000 MW of solar capacity by 2030 In Built to Last, the City set a goal to install 250 MW of solar on the rooftops of privately-owned buildings, in addition to 100 MW of solar power on City-owned facil - ities. The City has supported this goal by working with the New York City Solar Partnership to make the city a friendlier market for solar. In 2006, the Solar Partnership was formed by Sustain - able CUNY of the City University of New York (CUNY), the City, and the NYC Economic Development Corpora - tion (NYCEDC) to reduce market barriers for investing in solar, attract solar energy companies to the city, and increase solar energy production capacity. The City has supported the Solar Partnership to extend solar energy to communities that have historically lacked access to clean energy, allowing the Partnership to scale up two new and innovative solar programs. Shared Solar NYC supports community shared solar projects, where multi - ple customers can invest in a solar installation, providing opportunities for New Yorkers to invest in solar regard - less of home ownership (see Energy chapter). Solarize NYC is a citywide group purchasing program that can reduce solar costs for homeowners by 10-20 percent. The Solar Partnership is also working to increase the 67 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50BuildingsThe City will pursue new programs and initiatives to support its expanded solar target. The City has increased its investment in Solarize NYC to serve up to eight com - munities each year through 2025 to enable greater solar adoption on individual buildings. The City has also advo - cated to the State for the extension of the property tax abatement for solar PV systems that expires at the end of 2016. Finally, the City will continue its engagement with the State to help shape policies to support community shared solar programs to facilitate adoption in New York City (see Energy chapter). Ensure building decision-makers have access to building energy use information Building energy use information is essential for build - ing owners, decision-makers, and occupants to under - stand energy consumption and prioritize investments. The GGBP requires large building owners to complete energy and water use benchmarking once a year (LL84) and to complete an energy audit and retro-commission - ing once every 10 years to repair equipment deficiencies and identify efficiency opportunities (LL87). The City has committed to bringing all mid-sized buildings over 25,000 square feet in floor area under the requirements of the GGBP. As part of this anticipated expansion, the City launched the NYC Benchmarking Help Center in 2015 to provide technical assistance and support for all covered buildings in the benchmarking process. To facilitate access to energy information in City-fi - nanced affordable housing, the NYC Housing Preser - vation and Development (HPD) and the NYC Housing Development Corporation (HDC) now require owners and managers of buildings that enter their financing programs to benchmark their energy and water use. Pre-qualified vendors will provide automatic utility up - loads into an accessible platform that displays utility usage. This will allow property owners and managers to control and reduce utility costs through targeted effi - ciency improvements. The City continues to push for energy use information to become more accessible and transparent for build - ing occupants and tenants. In the TWG Report , the City committed to develop a comparative metric for com - mercial tenant energy use and a voluntary benchmark - ing program for commercial tenants to record and share building energy use information. The City will also seek to require sub-metering in non-residential tenant spaces that are larger than 5,000 square feet in area and require the disclosure of energy use and cost information for all real estate transactions. Solarize CB6 The NYC Solar Partnership developed a pilot Solarize campaign in Brooklyn Com - munity Board 6 (Solarize CB6) in 2015. The Partnership and community repre - sentatives selected two solar installers through a competitive process. Solarize CB6 held public educational workshops and participated in community events, ultimately reaching more than 660 res - idents and businesses. more than 350 people signed up for solar siting assess - ments, representing over 400 buildings. As a result, over 140 kW of solar capacity was installed at 25 percent less than the average cost for residential installations in the area. resiliency of communities by incorporating energy stor - age with solar installations through Sustainable CUNY's Smart Distributed Generation (DG) Hub. The Solar Partnership has worked with City agencies to reduce many of the barriers faced by property owners and installers by helping to develop streamlined City permit applications and other process improvements. DOB has reduced the average turnaround time for solar PV plan reviews from four to eight weeks to less than a day. Process improvements at the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) have also improved the outlook for solar, including lowering the pitched-roof threshold that has allowed for larger solar PV projects to be safely installed on an additional 5,000 New York City buildings. The NYC Department of City Planning (DCP) has also successfully introduced changes to zoning that established parameters to allow rooftop solar installa - tions on buildings throughout the city. Building on this progress, the City is now expanding the citywide installation target for private and public prop - erties to 1,000 MW by 2030. The new target builds on the success of existing programs and the impressive recent growth of the solar market in the city, as well as the introduction of promising technologies such as solar canopies and new market structures such as community shared solar. The City's expanded solar target will also complement the City's new goal to install 100 MWh of energy storage by 2020 (see Energy chapter). Buildings68 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycProvide assistance to the private sector to acceler - ate adoption of energy efficiency and clean energy It is challenging to implement energy efficiency and clean energy upgrades in buildings. There is a range of financing, incentive, and educational resources to help, but these can be difficult for building owners and deci - sion-makers to navigate. The City has created multiple programs to assist the private sector and accelerate the implementation of these upgrades. In September 2015, the City launched the NYC Retrofit Accelerator, a free program that offers advisory services to building owners and operators during all of the steps required to successfully complete water and energy effi - ciency projects. In 2016, the City launched Community Retrofit NYC as a complementary program specifically for small and mid-sized multifamily building owners in central and northern Brooklyn and southern Queens. Community Retrofit NYC also serves to create a pipeline for HPD's new Green Housing Preservation Program that provides low- and no-cost financing for efficiency upgrades as part of a broader scope of work in exchange for an affordable housing agreement. By 2025, these pro - grams are projected to reach up to 20,000 buildings and reduce the city's GHG emissions by nearly one million metric tons. Through the NYC Retrofit Accelerator and Community Retrofit NYC, the City also works closely with the New York State Energy Resource and Devel - opment Authority (NYSERDA) and the local utilities to deliver financial incentives for efficiency measures and ensure they are tailored to industry needs. Going forward, these programs will provide guidance to implement key efficiency measures on a voluntary basis. This includes an outreach and assistance campaign to be launched through the NYC Retrofit Accelerator in the fall of 2016 that is dedicated to helping building owners and decision-makers upgrade their steam heating distri - bution systems. The City also continues to collaborate with private sec - tor leaders. The NYC Carbon Challenge is the City's voluntary leadership program for private and institu - tional organizations to reduce their building-based GHG emissions by 30 percent or more over ten years. Since 2007, more than 75 participants have accepted the NYC Carbon Challenge, representing over 265 million square feet of real estate and accounting for seven percent of the city's building-based emissions. Participants have re - duced their carbon intensity by an average of 19 percent and ten participants have already achieved the GHG re - NYC Retrofit Accelerator Assistance for Steam Heating System Upgrades More than 70 percent of large buildings in New York City use steam heating dis - tribution systems, and these systems are rarely replaced and are often not regular - ly maintained. This can result in energy waste, clanging pipes, and uncomfort - ably cold spaces and overheated rooms in the same building. To help address this major source of the city's GHG emissions, the NYC Retrofit Accelerator is develop - ing outreach and assistance to encour - age and streamline upgrades to steam heating systems. This will build demand for these upgrades to help building de - cision-makers successfully complete the steps required to implement holistic, common-sense solutions. To ensure pro - gram participants have access to trusted contractors, the City has qualified and trained staff from the city's major heating service firms to implement this work. As a result, building owners and residents will save on heating costs and will no longer need to open a window in the dead of winter to cool an overheated apartment. duction target. In addition, twelve participants have now extended their commitments to a 50 percent reduction in GHG emissions by 2025\u2014paving the way with innova - tive strategies and best practices to achieve these deep carbon reductions. Streamline regulatory processes for building en - ergy efficiency and clean energy In April 2012, New York City Council adopted the Zone Green Text Amendment to the Zoning Resolution. The Amendment allows for external insulation of existing buildings, in conjunction with related changes to the State Multiple Dwelling Law; removes floor area penal - ties for thicker, highly efficient exterior walls when new buildings outperform City Energy Code; allows greater flexibility for the location of efficient air conditioning equipment; allows shading of windows to reduce sum - mer cooling needs; and allows solar electric and hot wa -69 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Buildingster systems to be added on the rooftops of any building, new or existing, in the city. To further remove barriers to implementing efficiency projects, the City will work with the NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) to update its rules and procedures for implementing efficiency and clean en - ergy upgrades in landmarked buildings and neighbor - hoods, such as restrictions on size, height, and visibility, and addressing areas of uncertainty. The LPC recent - ly provided additional guidance for solar installations on landmarked buildings, to clarify the standards for \"minimally visible.\" On a state level, the City will pur - sue amendments to the State Multiple Dwelling Law to remove requirements in conflict with energy efficiency standards. Ensure building owners can finance energy effi - ciency projects In 2009, the City created the New York City Energy Ef - ficiency Corporation (NYCEEC) as a non-profit finance company that provides loans and alternative financing solutions for energy efficiency and clean energy projects. NYCEEC finances projects across all building types and neighborhoods for energy efficiency and clean energy technologies. In the City's Housing New Y ork plan, the City commit - ted to financing energy and water efficiency measures in affordable housing as part of a moderate rehabilitation scope of work financed by the HPD or HDC. The Green Physical Needs Assessment (GPNA), released by HDC in 2015, integrates energy and water audit protocols into a physical needs assessment to ensure that the holistic needs of a property are addressed. HPD also launched the Green Housing Preservation Program in 2015, which provides no- and low-cost financing for efficiency im - provements along with moderate rehabilitation work for small- to mid-sized multifamily buildings. In 2016, HPD closed the first six projects in this program. In 2012, HDC launched the Program for Energy Retrofit Loans (PERL) to help finance energy efficiency projects in large affordable properties that must comply with the City's heating oil regulations and energy auditing and retro-commissioning requirements. HDC is now rede - signing PERL and is working with NYCEEC on an en - ergy services agreement model that fits with HDC proj - ects and will allow loans to be underwritten to projected savings. In addition to these options, there are numerous energy efficiency financing and incentive programs available in New York City through NYSERDA and the local utilities. The City created the NYC Retrofit Accelerator and Com - munity Retrofit NYC to help building owners and deci - sion-makers to identify and navigate these resources and examine opportunities to lower hard and soft costs of completing projects. The City will continue to work with NYSERDA and the utilities to identify new financing and incentives and will expand NYCEEC, which is a formal partner for the NYC Retrofit Accelerator, to provide in - creased financing and guidance to a greater number of buildings. Achieve exceptional energy performance for new buildings and substantial renovations The City first established a local Energy Conservation Code in 2009 (the Energy Code), providing the City with the ability to enact standards that are more stringent than State requirements. Since 2009, the City has con - sistently updated the Energy Code. Most recently, the City enacted the 2016 Energy Code which exceeds the State standards and achieves at least an 8.5 percent re - duction in energy use in new commercial buildings and at least a 25 percent reduction in energy use in new res - idential buildings as compared to the current standards. The City's affordable housing agencies require additional energy and sustainability standards for all new buildings and substantial renovations financed by the City by re - quiring a tailored version of the Enterprise Green Com - munities Criteria (EGCC), a comprehensive green build - ing framework designed for affordable housing. The City has also expanded enforcement of the Energy Code to ensure that new buildings realize the necessary energy use reductions Despite these advancements, the TWG found that a ho - listic approach to the Energy Code is necessary to sig - nificantly reduce GHG emissions from new buildings and substantial renovations while also potentially re - ducing construction costs.12 New York City will initiate a fundamental change to the Energy Code by working together with industry and City Council to introduce requirements for new buildings and substantial renova - tions to be designed to a whole building energy perfor - mance standard. The performance-based Energy Code will include an effective metric by building type that defines an energy performance target and accounts for the varying uses and occupancy intensities, allowing for variation across building types. Because the market needs time and resources to adjust, the City will phase Buildings70 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycin this change by first requiring new and substantially renovated buildings to report on this new metric in 2019 and then requiring energy performance design targets beginning in 2022. Building on the success of the Brussels Exemplary Build - ings Program, the City must develop proof of concept and allow the industry time to adapt. The City can launch a large-scale program to award the design and construc - tion of very-low energy buildings and provide education, training, marketing, and other incentives for competi - tion participants, as well as additional market support to help reduce the costs of related products and services. The data and industry experience from the program can help inform the development of the metric and targets for the new performance-based Energy Code. The City's affordable housing agencies are leading the charge towards high performance new construction and substantial renovations. In May 2016, HPD released Sus - taiNYC, a request for proposal for a site in East Harlem, which includes the requirement for achieving Passive House standards and will deliver housing affordability critical to the community. In addition, at least five other affordable housing developments in the city are pursu - ing Passive House certification in various stages of de - velopment. The City sees this as the new frontier of all residential design and construction and will learn from SustaiNYC to scale up this type of construction across its affordable housing stock. Lead by example in City-owned buildings The City has the opportunity to lead innovation and in - dustry experience by using the thousands of buildings it owns and operates as laboratories for energy efficiency and sustainability. Since 2005, all City-owned develop - ments receiving a certain amount of City funding have been required to achieve a Leadership in Energy and En - vironmental Design (LEED\u00ae) rating level of Certified or Silver. DDC and the City's School Construction Authority (SCA) have pursued even more ambitious energy design in their new projects, such as the Kathleen Grimm School for Leadership and Sustainability at Sandy Ground that was built to net-zero energy standards. DDC also recent - ly expanded the scope of its commissioning contracts to include energy auditing and identify more opportunities to improve energy performance at the outset of its proj - ects. This will include building envelope commissioning to optimize the thermal performance and airtightness of building exteriors and ensure that they are built and test - ed to specifications. Kathleen Grimm School for Leadership and Sustainability at Sandy Ground The Kathleen Grimm School for Leader - ship and Sustainability at Sandy Ground (Public School 62) is the first \"net-zero energy\" school constructed in New York City and one of the first of its kind world - wide. The two-story school is 68,000 square feet and serves 444 pre-kinder - garten through fifth grade students. The design reduces energy use by roughly 50 percent as compared to a standard new NYC public school by using an ultra-tight high performance building envelop, day- lit corridors, energy recovery, a geother - mal well field, and demand-control ven - tilation. The building offsets the rest of the energy use with wrap-around solar PV panels that are placed on the entire roof area and the south fa\u00e7ade, giving the building its iconic skin, and includes solar thermal panels to provide domestic hot water and supplement the heating sys - tem. In March 2016, the City enacted Local Law 31, requir - ing all new capital projects for City-owned properties to be constructed to consume at least 50 percent less en - ergy than buildings constructed to today's standards. As part of this initiative, DDC is also conducting a study to demonstrate how all new City-owned buildings can be designed to achieve Passive House standards by 2030. Photo credit: NYC School Construction Authority71 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Buildings The City's experience will help generate data and indus - try expertise that will be helpful when developing the new performance-based Energy Code for all buildings. The City's efforts will also provide a training ground for the skills that will be necessary for local professionals and contractors to develop and construct very-low en - ergy buildings. In 2014, the City committed to investing over $1 billion to complete efficiency improvements in every municipal building with significant energy use and installing 100 MW of on-site renewable power by 2025. As part of this commitment, the City announced a major expansion of programs administered by the Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) to accelerate efficiency improvements in City-owned properties. DCAS invests in high-value energy efficiency proj - ects through its Accelerated Conservation & Efficiency (ACE) program, which it has recently expanded to reach additional City agencies. The City is also developing new contracting mechanisms to implement deep retrofits in key City-owned facilities, prioritizing buildings with the greatest opportunity for energy savings through a com - prehensive retrofit, and pursuing pilots for clean energy technology on selected properties. To date, DCAS has completed over 1,000 energy efficiency and clean en - ergy projects across 675 buildings, which have reduced GHG emissions from City-owned buildings by an esti - mated 120,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) annually. The City collects and shares ener - gy use information about its buildings through regular benchmarking, energy audits, and retro-commissioning for buildings 10,000 square feet and larger.The City is also investing in renewable energy and ener - gy storage technologies. The City has installed 8.8 MW of solar PV across 52 buildings, and is on track to reach a quarter of its 100 MW goal by the end of 2018. This includes a 15 MW Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) to install rooftop solar on 88 additional public buildings, including 66 schools. Wherever possible, solar PV in - stallations will be paired with energy storage systems to provide peak load shaving and emergency backup power, which will be prioritized for schools serving as emergen - cy shelters, fire houses, homeless shelters and communi - ty centers. To support expanded solar installations, the City passed Local Law 24 of 2016, requiring DCAS to as - sess the solar PV potential of public buildings' rooftops to inform a citywide strategy for the siting and procure - ment of solar PV systems at municipal facilities. The City has also established a solar curriculum that is being incorporated into classroom learning in public schools to help bring the benefits of solar energy to life. DCAS and the City's Department of Education (DOE) partnered with Solar One, a non-profit organization, to provide curriculum, classroom supplies, and profession - al development training to teachers whose schools re - ceived solar PV installations. The New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA), which provides housing for more than 400,000 New Yorkers in its public housing portfolio, has pledged to reduce the energy used per square foot in its buildings by 20 per - cent by 2025. NYCHA's 10-year NextGen NYCHA Sus - tainability Agenda includes strategies for portfolio-wide energy efficiency upgrades, smart buildings technolo - gies, and energy, whole-building retrofits cific buildings.13 NYCHA plans to attract $300 million in private capital through energy performance contracts, which will fund upgrades for large scale retrofits. For small buildings and scattered sites, NYCHA will leverage New York State and utility-run efficiency programs to reduce energy use and secure $30 million in public and private incentives by 2025.14 All new NYCHA construc - tion projects will be required to conform to the New York City-specific requirements outlined as Enterprise Green Communities Criteria, while substantial and moderate rehabilitation projects will also be required to meet new energy standards. NYCHA will also work with HPD and HDC to require or encourage ultra-low energy buildings in requests for proposals to develop housing on unused NYCHA properties. Solar PV Installation at DCAS Facility Photo credit: NYC Department of Citywide Administrative ServicesBuildings72 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycDCAS and DDC have partnered to implement a new Low Energy Pilot Program to optimize energy performance in capital projects and support the integration of ener - gy efficiency into the City's design guidelines and capital planning. The City will complete an Energy Master Plan on all new DDC-initiated capital projects, which will in - clude site-specific recommendations for deep energy re - duction measures that will be selected based on a holistic cost-benefit analysis. The pilot will next be expanded to the SCA. DCAS and DDC are also partnering on a pilot to incor - porate solar PV as part of DDC capital construction projects, which could include solar canopies on munic - ipal parking lots, electric vehicle charging stations, and extended life of the parking lot surface. In addition, the City is assessing wastewater treatment plants and other properties for their solar PV potential to offset public building energy loads. Prepare New York City's workforce to deliver high performance buildings The tens of thousands of architects, engineers, develop - ers, building operators, energy service providers, con - tractors, manufacturers, and tradespeople in New York City are a critical link to achieving and maintaining ener - gy and GHG reductions from across the city's buildings. The City created the Building Energy Exchange (BEEx) in 2010 as an independent non-profit organization to drive energy efficiency in the built environment through a first-of-its-kind resource center in downtown Manhat - tan. BEEx provides educational resources, exhibits, and targeted research for the industry on energy efficiency technologies and strategies. The resource center serves as a hub for the NYC Retrofit Accelerator and for activi - ties that help building owners, operators, and designers understand and implement energy efficiency and clean energy upgrades. New Yorkers currently have access to a range of external trainings in energy efficiency best practices through or - ganizations such as the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY), Buildings Operators Management Association NY (BOMA NY), Urban Green Council, and others. A key service provided by the NYC Retrofit Accelerator is to connect building decision-makers, staff, and industry professionals with these trainings and provide additional trainings where there are gaps. This will help reach new segments of building decision-makers, including proper - ty managers and real estate professionals. The City is committed to expanding access to these train - ings for the next generation of building operators and decision-makers to ensure better building performance and provide new pathways for career advancement. The City has committed to creating a new building operator training program that will be practical and tailored to the needs of staff in underrepresented building types, in - cluding small, mid-sized, and affordable buildings. The City has expanded operations and maintenance training for its municipal-owned buildings staff. These include the Preventative Maintenance Collaborative, which strategically funds skilled staff, tools, and materi - als for agencies to better manage and maintain munici - pal buildings, and the Expenses for Conservation and Ef - ficiency Leadership (ExCEL) program, which provides City agencies with an additional opportunity to apply for non-capital specific funding to further support op - erations and maintenance improvements on a compet - itive basis. In addition, as part of its NextGen NYCHA Sustainability Agenda, NYCHA will begin implementing training and retro-commissioning initiatives to address over- and under-heating problems common throughout NYCHA properties. To ease compliance with New York City's existing oper - ations and maintenance laws and regulations, the City will aggregate the relevant laws and regulations into one central resource to make requirements accessible. The City will also include lessons learned from the Preventa - tive Maintenance Collaborative in City-owned buildings and best practices from NYC Carbon Challenge partic - ipants to develop guides that assist owners of various building types to develop their own building-specific op - erations and maintenance plans. Position New York City as a global hub for energy efficiency and clean energy technology NYCEDC supports clean technology entrepreneurship and urban innovation through a program called Urban - tech NYC. The initiative offers to emerging companies incubation and \"step-out\" spaces, prototyping equip - ment, commercialization support, and shared resources such as mentorship and demonstration opportunities. Since 2014, the Urban Future Lab, including the ACRE Incubator, has helped dozens of early-stage clean tech companies, stimulating innovation and economic growth while generating new jobs for New Yorkers. In 2016, NYCEDC activated two new Urban Technology Growth Hubs at Grand Central Tech in Midtown Man - hattan and the Brooklyn Navy Yard. 73 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50BuildingsThe City is also building on NYCEDC's Applied Scienc - es NYC initiative to expand world-class applied sciences and engineering campuses. In 2011, the City announced the Cornell Techn on campus on Roosevelt Island, which will nearly double the number of full-time engineering students enrolled in New York City Masters and Ph.D. programs. The new campus itself will also pave the way for high performance buildings, with the construction of the tallest Passive House building in the world underway. The Applied Sciences NYC initiative also includes Co - lumbia University's Data Science Institute and New York University's Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP). CUSP is now a recognized leader in building en - ergy analysis, most recently partnering with the City to release New York City's Energy and Water Use 2013 Re - port analyzing the City's 2013 benchmarking and energy auditing data. The CUNY Institute for Urban Systems Building Perfor - mance Lab (BPL), founded in 2006, is another initiative to advance high-performance building operations and practices. The BPL provides continuing education pro - grams for facility managers, building operators, and en - ergy professionals; internships for CUNY students; and building systems research and development. The BPL has also created training curriculums used across the City. The City has continued to advance investment in emerg - ing entrepreneurs through its own purchasing power. DCAS's Innovative Demonstrations for Energy Adapt - ability (IDEA) program engages vendors of new or un - der-utilized energy technologies to test their solutions in City-owned buildings. DCAS has advanced four phases of the IDEA program, focusing on building controls, en - ergy storage, heating and cooling system optimization, and innovative renewable energy technologies. DCAS will share results from the successful technologies with the private sector and other City agencies through a cen - tral clearinghouse of case studies, performance data, and analytics. Laying the Foundation for the Future To achieve 80 x 50, nearly every building in NYC will need to complete a deep energy retrofit that holistical - ly addresses heating, cooling, and the building envelope. There will also need to be a significant shift away from fossil fuel-based heating and hot water systems towards renewable energy sources and efficient electric technol - ogies. Building owners and decision-makers will need to improve operations and maintenance and empower tenants and residents to manage their energy use. The City must also move as quickly as possible towards a per - formance-based Energy Code in new construction and substantial renovations that will achieve ultra-low ener - gy buildings. Buildings can also play an important role in scaling up distributed renewable energy resources, such as solar PV, and community-scale solutions, such as dis - trict heating and cooling networks, but coordination bar - riers and regulatory hurdles will need to be addressed. The City must support the implementation of deep en - ergy retrofit strategies in private sector buildings and lead by example by testing these strategies and emerging technologies in City buildings. Renewable and efficient electric technologies for heat and hot water production are viable today, but they will need to be supported by policies and programs to encourage wide-scale adoption. Building owners and decision-makers will need clear guidance on how to phase in retrofits and provided suffi - cient time for capital planning. Building tenants and res - idents will also need to do their part to save energy and will need to be empowered with smart ways to control their energy use and costs. IDEA Program Demonstrates Innovative Energy Storage Systems for Buildings Recognizing the importance of energy storage technologies to improve resil - iency for public facilities and scale up renewable technologies, DCAS and NYC Health + Hospitals are advancing two en - ergy storage demonstration projects as part of the City's IDEA program. Through this program, the City is piloting the Uni Energy Technologies (UET) ReFlex va - nadium flow battery at Jacobi Hospital and the Encell Technology, Inc. fused ion battery at Queens Hospital. These proj - ects will contribute to the City's new goal to create 100 MWh of energy storage by 2020, demonstrate energy savings through peak load reduction, and inform applications in future projects, such as pairing storage with solar PV to enhance building resiliency. Buildings74 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycBuildings have a critical role to play to achieve our solar and energy storage targets, and the City will need to sup - port these efforts. Solar PV technologies are rapidly im - proving in terms of both efficiencies and design. Energy storage technologies are also improving, which increase the usable energy from renewable technologies. Con - tinued efforts to overcome market barriers, streamline permitting, and alleviate other regulatory impediments will be important to scale these evolving technologies and realize the full potential for energy efficiency and distributed renewable energy. As a result, the City will create new jobs and expand the industry of building pro - fessionals in high demand both locally and globally. Building owners, decision-makers, and residents will need educational, financial, and technical resources to make informed investments. This includes information about their building energy use, new financing products and incentives to cover the costs, more streamlined reg - ulatory processes, and assistance navigating these re - sources. Wide-scale training for industry professionals, contractors, and building staff will be necessary to im - plement a performance-based Energy Code, as well as to achieve and maintain energy savings in existing build - ings. The City can and will continue to be a leader in the effort to improve the efficiency, affordability, and resiliency of its building stock. The City will continue to lead by example in its own buildings, and will develop new pro - grams and policies over the next three decades to trans - form the city's buildings to ultra-low energy structures that are comfortable and affordable. As always, the City will work closely with the State and federal government and its private sector partners to ensure that these pol - icies are adapted to the needs of the industry while also realizing our ambitious climate goals.75 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50BuildingsBuildings Strategies Energy Buildings Transportation Waste Implement cost-effective upgrades in existing build - ings to improve energy efficiency in the near-term Scale up deep energy retrofits in existing buildings that holistically address heating systems, cooling sys - tems, and building envelopes and transition buildings away from fossil fuels Expand distributed solar energy and install 1,000 MW of solar capacity by 2030 Ensure building owners and decision-makers have access to building energy use information Provide assistance to the private sector to accelerate adoption of energy efficiency and clean energy Streamline regulatory processes for building energy efficiency Ensure building owners can finance energy efficiency projects Achieve exceptional energy performance for new buildings and substantial renovations Lead by example in City-owned buildings Prepare New York City's workforce to deliver high performance buildings Position New York City as a global hub for energy efficiency and clean energy technology76 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycTransportationTransportation77 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50TransportationIn 2050... We envision that getting around the city will have be - come dramatically safer, cleaner, and more convenient. Mobility will have largely become an on-demand service with mobile applications allowing New Yorkers to plan the most efficient route from Point A to Point B, opti - mizing among available options such as the subway, bus, bike share, ferry, or a shared mini-bus, with seamless payment within the entire region and across all modes. Sustainable modes of transportation\u2014walking, biking, and transit\u2014will comprise 80 percent of all trips taken in the city, with the transit system remaining New York's workhorse for moving residents and visitors around, and new development focused around high-capacity transit hubs. Meanwhile, the share of trips taken by automobile will have dropped from 33 to 20 percent with travelers instead relying on app-based shared mobility services. Remaining vehicles will be cleaner and more efficient than today's vehicles. Roughly half of new car purchases will be zero-emission vehicles, and low-carbon fuels will have largely replaced petroleum-based gasoline and die - sel. Additionally, the proliferation of autonomous vehi - cles will have dramatically reduced the need for parking and personal car ownership. Additionally, by 2050, the City and industry partners will have reshaped the freight network. Goods move - ment within the city will have shifted somewhat from trucks toward inherently lower-carbon modes, such as maritime and rail freight. Heavy trucks, locomotives, marine vessels, and freight yard equipment will run on lower-carbon fuels, and mini-distribution hubs served by trains and marine vessels will allow consumer goods to be transferred to low- or zero-emission vehicles and delivery bikes to reach their final destinations. Most significantly of all, the City's sustained efforts towards Vision Zero combined with reductions in harmful air pollution from fewer and cleaner vehicles on the road will have greatly reduced public health impacts from transportation.78 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycTransportation Achieving 80 x 50: Transportation New York City has the highest proportion of trips by modes other than private vehicles\u2014walking, biking, and public transit\u2014of any large U.S. city.1 Achieving deep emission reductions from this already low base in the transportation sector, therefore, entails even more dra - matic changes than might be required in a more car-de - pendent system. It will also require a holistic approach given the maturity and diversity of the New York metro region's transportation network. There is no \"silver bul - let.\" Reducing transportation-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is rooted in an \"avoid/shift/improve\" ap - proach. Some trips can be avoided entirely through bet - ter integration of transportation and land-use decisions, transportation demand management and better use of data and technology\u2014for example, locating affordable housing units in closer proximity to job centers is an effective way to avoid the need for longer trips. Of the remaining trips, many can be shifted from high-car - bon modes (such as single-occupancy private cars or taxis) to lower-carbon modes (transit, biking, walking, shared rides)\u2014this is known as \"mode shift.\" In addition, the technology and fuel mix of all vehicles can be im - proved through a dramatic shift to electric and other zero-emission vehicles, as well as greater use of renew - able or low-carbon fuels and improved vehicle designs. Long-term success in embracing this \"avoid/shift/im - prove\" framework will depend on our ability to leverage advances in technology, respond to market signals, in - fluence travel behavior through smart planning and in - frastructure investment, engage in fruitful collaboration with State and regional partners, and ultimately, em - brace a wholesale change in our transportation culture. These changes will have the added benefits of reducing trip travel time, expanding options for getting around, and improving overall public health through better air quality and increased physical activity. \"Avoid/shift/improve\" strategies also support the City's OneNYC growth, equity, and resiliency visions. Beyond Avoid/Shift/Improve The approaches outlined in this chapter will alter travel patterns in the city between to - day and 2050 in three fundamental ways. Some trips will be avoided, no longer need - ed because of improvements in land-use or technology (such as teleconferencing in - stead of driving to an off-site meeting). Oth - ers will be shifted to lower-carbon modes as walking and biking, in particular, become increasingly safe and convenient. Still oth - ers will be improved through a transition to cleaner technologies, such as electric pow - ertrains or renewable forms of common fu - els like diesel and compressed natural gas. Certain trips will be impacted by more than one element of this paradigm, as when mul - tiple current single-occupancy vehicle trips in gasoline-powered cars that transition to a single shared ride trip powered by elec - tricity. Existing Shift Improve Avoid79 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Transportation climate action, sustainable transportation planning boosts the economy by cutting down on congestion caused by single occupancy vehicles, promotes healthy, active modes of transport such as walking and biking that can reduce the prevalence of chronic diseases, and creates a safer transportation system that leads us to - ward realizing the \"zero\" in Vision Zero. Expanding travel choices for New Yorkers who do not have easy access to a vehicle through smart transit investments will also strengthen the critical link between transpor - tation and access to jobs and economic opportunity. In addition, reducing the number of trips and shifting to cleaner vehicle technologies and fuels can reduce emis - sions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and other air pollutants. Drivers of Transportation GHG emissions The transportation sector is responsible for 28 percent of citywide GHG emissions. On-road transportation (ve -hicles, transit and long-distance buses, trucks, taxis, and for-hire vehicles) comprises 94 percent of transporta - tion-related GHG emissions in New York City from the more than 21 billion annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT) on the city's streets. Private on-road light-duty vehicles (i.e., cars) alone account for 78 percent of all transportation GHG emissions. A majority of VMT in the city (90%) is generated from trips that neither begin nor end in the central business district (CBD, or Manhattan below 60th Street) but rath - er in upper Manhattan, the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Some of these miles are associated with trips that begin or end outside the city (36%), but most are contained within the city (54%). Trips that begin and end outside the city (\"transboundary trips\") make up a small percentage of in-city VMT (6%). Trips associated with travel to, from, or within the CBD are also relatively limited (10%). 89.6% On-Road VehiclesDrivers GHG EmissionsDrivers of Transportation GHG Emissions Transportation GHG Emissions With Pure Cities 0 1 2 3 4 5PortlandOaklandSan FranciscoBostonWashingtonPhiladelphiaTorontoNew YorkVancouverBilbaoOsloStockholmCopenhagenGrande VitoriaMadridSeoulLondonParisTransportation GHG Emissions With Peer Cities (tCO 2e per Capita) Source: Compact of Mayors data for cities >100,000 people with established GHG reduc - tions targets and plans80 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycTransportationPublic Health Impacts due to Vehicle Emissions Reducing emissions from traffic in and around New York City can improve public health - especially among our most vulner - able residents. Vehicles emit fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which contributes to multiple adverse health outcomes. The City's Depart - ment of Health and Mental Hygiene recently released a study which found that traffic-re - lated PM2.5 causes 320 premature deaths and 870 emergency department visits and hospitalizations each year among City resi - dents. The largest adverse health outcomes came from trucks and buses traveling the City's streets, which account for over half of traffic PM2.5-related health outcomes. The study also found that traffic-related PM2.5 pollu - tion and its health impacts were greater in the City's poorer neighborhoods. Relative to more affluent neighborhoods, high-poverty neighborhoods had 1.7 times the PM2.5 exposure and 9.3 times the rate of emergency department visits for asthma due to emissions from trucks and buses. By prioritizing at - tention to the most polluting vehicles and the most burdened neighborhoods, we can help to reduce health inequities in New York City.

This analysis took into account general background growth in the city's population and transportation activity as well as the emissions impacts of relevant previously committed and funded initiatives and regulations at the city, state and federal levels and assumes no further intervention by the City. Under this scenario, transportation-related GHG emissions are ex - pected to decline 36 percent by 2030 and 40 percent by 2050 compared to 2005. These reductions are largely the result of federal fuel economy standards, such as the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, as vehicle fleets turn over, as well as prior investments over the last decade that were intended to encourage mode shift. These include the rollout of the first wave of Select Bus Service (SBS) routes, which feature several benefits over standard bus service including traffic signal priori - ty and dedicated bus lanes. Mobility as a Service New York has a vast and growing array of transportation options: buses and subways, taxis and ridesharing, commuter vans and on-demand shared rides, bike share and car share. We want to get around in what - ever way makes the most sense, whether in terms of cost, time or enjoyment. What if we did not have to worry about how we made our trip and paid for it, but rather could rely on technology to help us get where we need to go using whichever modes work best for a given trip? Shared mobility, which encompasses any transportation mode outside of driving your own car, presents new opportunities for New Yorkers who currently own personal vehicles to reconsider these major purchases. Shared mobility can mean many things, from point- to-point car share, filling empty seats in on-demand for-hire vehicles, or making what could have been a slow, congestion-filled vehicle trip on a more flexible (and healthy) bike share ride. The common theme is a widening spectrum of choice regarding travel options that blend modes to - gether and provide only the necessary level of service for a given trip. By removing the vehicle ownership element from the travel equation, the number of cars on the road \u2014and parked on the curb \u2014may decrease. If done right, shared mobility services, along with technology-enabled trip planning and universal fare payment, offer the potential to be even more con - venient than today's numerous but mostly separate systems, providing more ubiquitous and affordable mobility to more of the population. Mobility as a ser - vice will create a dynamic marketplace of travel op - tions, allowing New Yorkers to more fluidly choose a customized \"basket\" of transportation modes de - pending on their needs. 54% Trips Within C ity, Outside CBD30%1% Trips within CBD 6% Trips O utside C ity, Passing Through C ity (e.g New Jersey t o Long Island)9% Trips Within City, to or From CBDShar e of Total N YC VMT by Trip Origins & D estina tions Trips outside City to or from City, outside CBD (e.g. Long Island to or from Brooklyn)Share of Total NYC Vehicle Miles Traveled by Trip Origins and Destinations82 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycTransportationTherefore, without further action, the City is almost on track to achieve 40 x 30, but is well short of the citywide 80 percent reduction goal for 2050. Private on-road light-duty vehicles are expected to account for 51 percent of transportation GHG emissions in 2030 and 46 percent in 2050, demonstrating the need for additional effort to facilitate the avoidance of cer - tain types of trips,shift others to lower-carbon modes, and expedite the improvement of all vehicle trips to cleaner and more efficient technologies and fuels. Emerging trends Shared mobility. The transportation sector is on the verge of more dramatic changes than at any point since the advent of the automobile. Our society is shifting to - wards a more blended mix of mobility options than has traditionally been the case. These shifts include more shared mobility models, more low-emission vehicles that operate on renewable or low-carbon fuels, and the impending introduction of autonomous vehicles. These shifts have the potential to work in support of GHG re - duction and other City goals, such as improving traffic safety, job access, and air quality. Electric vehicles. In addition to changes in the way New Yorkers get around, a growing recognition of the dangers of climate change and supportive policies are expected to continue to impact purchasing decisions, especially as cleaner vehicle technologies mature. While battery electric, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell vehicles comprise a very small share of today's car market, these zero-emission vehicles are projected to comprise 15 per - cent of new car purchases in 2030 and will be roughly half of all new cars sold in 2050. The trend toward elec - trification will extend beyond cars, reaching medium- and heavy-duty vehicles as well as non-road equipment and maritime vessels in more limited applications. For instance, shore power (also called \"cold-ironing\"), or the use of land-side electricity to power onboard systems for ships while at port, has already been deployed for cruise ships in Brooklyn and can greatly reduce idling emissions and improve local air quality. Renewable and low-carbon fuels. Where no elec - tric alternative is feasible, vehicles will increasingly use renewable or lower-carbon versions of today's pe - troleum-based fuels. For heavy-duty vehicles, ferries, and other large non-road engines, natural gas is likely to continue its recent market growth. Renewable nat - ural gas from landfill, agriculture, or other non-fossil feedstocks offer an opportunity to provide low-carbon replacements for today's natural gas in the future, and renewable diesel can replace the use of petroleum in any remaining diesel engines.

A final trend that relates to transporta - tion is the way in which we purchase and consume. The growing popularity of e-commerce has the potential to place additional strain on our street network, even as it reduces consumer vehicle trips and as fleets become more efficient. 80 x 50 Roadmap: Transportation Beyond those initiatives included in the BAU analysis, the City has recently launched or expanded many pro - grams and initiatives that will help the city move closer to 80 x 50. OneNYC includes several programs related to transportation that will result in future emissions reduction, including Vision Zero. The NYC Depart - ment of Transportation's (DOT) Strategic Plan 2016: Safe\u00b7Green\u00b7Smart\u00b7Equitable (Strategic Plan 2016 ), pro - vides more specificity and additional commitments that will help pave the way towards significant emissions re - ductions, including increasing the efficiency of freight movement in New York City, dramatically expanding bike infrastructure, and planning for the next genera - tion of SBS and light rail routes. These recently launched programs are expected to re - duce GHG emissions below the BAU trajectory by an ad - ditional 6 percent by 2030 and 9 percent by 2050. These programs set New York City on a track to achieve an an - ticipated 42 percent reduction in transportation-related GHG emissions relative to 2005 by 2030, exceeding the City's 40 x 30 goal. By 2050, these recently launched and expanded efforts are projected to get the City to an estimated 49 percent reduction in transportation-relat - ed GHG emissions below 2005 levels. Since existing initiatives alone will not get us to 80 x 50, the City assessed additional scenarios to understand the level of reductions in VMT and uptake of cleaner vehicles necessary to achieve the goal. The analysis showed that significant adoption of zero-emission vehi - cle (ZEV) technologies\u2014those that have either zero tailpipe emissions and very low lifecycle GHG emissions\u2014and low-carbon fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG), combined with existing initiatives, could achieve a 51 percent reduction by 2030 and a 71 percent reduction in transportation-related GHG emis - sions by 2050. To estimate potential GHG emissions reduction associ - ated with lower VMT, the City tested several scenari - os using the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council's (NYMTC) regional travel demand model (the Best Practice Model, or BPM). The results showed that 2050 Improv ed Network Efciency ImprovedFreightEfciencyImprovedElectricityGridLow CarbonFuels 2e)84 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycTransportationreaching 80 x 50 citywide will require a wide variety of transportation strategies to incentivize a shift away from single-occupancy driving towards lower-carbon modes. BPM simulations also revealed that enhance - ments to make transit service more convenient are a necessary complement to provide an attractive alterna - tive to single-occupancy vehicle (SOV) use. Altogether, the analysis found that expanding current commitments and supplementing them with strategies to reduce the number of trips made by personal driving and to shift new vehicle purchases to cleaner technol - ogies can result in GHG emissions reduction of 58 per - cent by 2030 and 82 percent by 2050 relative to the 2005 baseline. Importantly, this portfolio of actions translates to a mode share of 80 percent for walking, biking, or public transit, whereas these sustainable modes com - prise only 67 percent of trips today. Challenges to address The efficiency of New York City's transportation system is largely the result of plans and investments made over the past 150 years. The systems that exist today are not easily changed, and the interrelated challenges posed by regulatory and operational jurisdictions are deeply in - stitutionalized. For many of the strategies necessary to achieve 80 x 50, New York State government including the Metropol - itan Transportation Authority (MTA) and New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), re - gional partners such as the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and NJ Transit, and federally regulat - ed entities like Amtrak are critical for implementation. Addressing certain transportation needs in the city is complicated due to the City's lack of control over key elements of the system, such as the improvement and expansion of the core transit network, setting of fares, pricing to manage the city's busiest roads and bridges, and the use of cameras for enforcement (e.g., of bus lane restrictions, speeding, and red lights). In order to reach 80 x 50, these partnerships with outside stakeholders will be essential in implementing an \"all of the above\" basket of strategies that facilitates the necessary tran - sitions. Another significant challenge to improving the transit network in particular is the magnitude of the funding needed simply to maintain a state of good repair for ex - isting assets, let alone to upgrade and expand the sys - tem. New York's infrastructure is aging, and major new funding is required to make the investments necessary to simply keep pace with our global peer cities. This task is all the more difficult because of less dependable federal funding: the federal gas tax, the primary reve - nue source for the Highway Trust Fund, has not been increased since 1992. There is a need to find innovative ways to fund new investments and, just as importantly, to maintain existing assets. There are also many challenges associated with wide- scale adoption of new vehicle technologies and low-car - bon fuels. Primarily, there is the \"chicken-and-egg\" problem: investments in electric vehicles are hampered by uncertainty regarding charging capacity through - out the city, while investments in publicly available charging infrastructure are uncertain to pay off as long as demand for charging remains low. In addition to this coordination barrier, the prospect of wide-scale adoption of ZEVs poses its own challenges. Namely, the Mode Shif t Mass T ransit (Bus, Light Rail, Ferry)Walking BikingShared Mobility & for Hire Vehicles Personal DrivingExisting nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Transportationcharging and fueling infrastructure required to support the level of ZEV adoption necessary to achieve 80 x 50 would place significant demands on the local electricity system and would introduce the challenge of siting in - frastructure in a dense urban setting where parking is already at a premium. Finally, the potential increase in truck trips associ - ated with the growth of internet-based commerce and home deliveries could worsen congestion on our streets and along our curbs. This issue is exacerbat - ed by the city's current lack of significant freight rail connections, which further increases our reliance on trucks to move our goods throughout the city. Near-term actions to reduce green - house gas emissions The following strategies include a mix of existing and expanded City initiatives along with several new City strategies intended to provide reductions in GHG emis - sions. The City can implement many of these approach - es directly; others will require partnerships with region - al stakeholders, New York State government, or others. Taken together, these strategies seek to encourage trav - el by lower-carbon modes over personal vehicles; mini - mize congestion and total miles driven through technol - ogy, market signals, and new mobility service models; transition towards more efficient vehicles that run on cleaner and renewable fuel sources; and re-envision freight policies to reduce congestion, emissions, and costs. These strategies are also intended to improve the health and quality of life of our communities. Modernize, expand, and reduce crowding on the city's transit system New York City already has the most comprehensive transit system in the U.S. To achieve 80 x 50, many more New Yorkers and visitors will need to opt for lower-car - bon modes over vehicles, which requires these modes to be safe, convenient, and enjoyable. In partnership with the MTA, the City continues to launch new SBS lines throughout the five boroughs and has committed to launch ten additional routes by 2021, including two new routes by the end of 2016. The City has also begun a detailed feasibility analysis for the Brooklyn-Queens Connector (BQX), a modern street - car line planned to connect residents to burgeoning job centers along the Brooklyn and Queens waterfronts that currently lack robust transit access. In addition, the launch of Citywide Ferry Service in 2017 will bet - ter meet the transportation needs of growing neighbor - hoods and prov ide redundancy for the existing transit system. The City is also committed to improving critical first- and last-mile trips to and from transit hubs, and is cur - rently exploring the potential for ride-sharing services to meet these travel needs in areas underserved by the subway system. As stated in DOT's recently released Strategic Plan 2016, the agency, in partnership with the MTA, will conduct a study of unmet transit needs in communities across the five boroughs and develop a set of recommendations to meet these needs. Possible rec - ommendations include expansions of Select Bus Service (SBS), the rail system, and streetcars. Speeding up bus service is critical to reversing the de - cline in bus ridership and making the bus an attractive alternative to driving. The introduction of paperless all-door boarding on all buses (not just those branded as SBS) would enable buses to spend less time waiting for passengers to board and would have a significant Image credit: NYC Economic Development Corporation86 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycTransportationThe goal of these improvements is to increase transit use, which could be achieved through reduced fares for commuter rail trips within the five boroughs and more frequent service at commuter rail stations within the city, among other strategies. These improvements will enable more New Yorkers, especially those who live be - yond the reach of the subway system, to use the com - muter rail network to get around. Make walking and biking safer, more convenient options for all New Yorkers Walking and biking are carbon-free modes of transpor - tation that support an active lifestyle, promote public health, and reinforce New York's role as a leader in sus - tainability among American cities. It is critical to make walking and biking even safer, more convenient, and more enjoyable in order to promote them over car trips, both as primary modes and as first- and last-mile con - nections to the core transit network. Consistent with Vision Zero and DOT's Strategic Plan 2016, the City will continue to implement record num - bers of Vision Zero street safety projects, including new markings, pedestrian refuge islands, and shortened pe - destrian crossing distances, and will invest in the Great Streets program to transform major corridors across the city. DOT will continue to make pedestrian im - provements around schools and in neighborhoods with high numbers of senior citizens, create neighborhood open spaces through pedestrian plaza projects using underutilized street space, and improve the streets - cape with benches and wayfinding signs, among other enhancements. DOT will also improve accessibility for New Yorkers with disabilities by upgrading the Street Design Manual and capital project standards to reflect the principles of universal access, installing accessible pedestrian signals, investing in an expansion of curb ramps, and conducting new wayfinding technology pi - lots for visually impaired pedestrians. DOT is also currently testing new design treatments to reduce left turn conflicts\u2014one of the leading causes of crashes involving pedestrians\u2014and is seeking State au - thorization to expand the use of speed cameras, which have been shown to reduce dangerous speeding by as much as 50 percent. DOT will also explore how new tools, including stationary and mobile traffic cameras and video processing software, may help DOT to better understand and manage the street network and improve safety, such as by helping the agency diagnose potential safety problems before a serious crash occurs.impact on bus service quality and the efficiency of bus travel. The City will continue to advocate for paperless all-door boarding on the MTA's local bus routes as part of the MTA's new fare payment system, in addition to working with the State Legislature to expand the City's authorization to use bus lane enforcement cameras, which are essential to providing more reliable and fast - er bus service. The City will also continue to support the expansion of the transit system through its historic $2.5 billion con - tribution to the MTA's 2015-2019 capital plan, which funds the second phase of the Second Avenue Subway, the Penn Station Access project to bring Metro North trains into Penn Station, and expansion of communica - tions-based train control, which enables more frequent subway service. Working with the Port Authority, Am - trak, and others, the City will also support key invest - ments in the regional transit network, including the Gateway project to expand and enhance trans-Hudson rail service through a new tunnel, station, and track ex - pansion. This support will extend to smaller but equal - ly crucial investments that improve the subway system such as the rollout of the new MTA fare payment sys - tem (which will replace MetroCard) and investments in open gangway subway cars to increase capacity. Final - ly, through a 2017 citywide transit needs study, the City will communicate its priorities for the next generation of major regional capital investments. Since most improvements in the subway and commuter rail system are the responsibility of State and regional partners, the City will continue to engage with them to plan for major expansions of the transit network. Protected bike lane at Clinton St. in Manhattan Photo credit: NYC Department of Transportation87 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50TransportationWhile New York remains a walking city, more New York - ers are biking now than ever before. The City will con - tinue its expansion of a growing bicycle network, with a record 75 miles of bike network to be added in 2016, including 18 miles of protected lanes, and an accelerat - ed annual target of at least 10 miles of protected lanes to build out a more robust protected network. DOT is also expanding its efforts to create bicycle connections across bridges and is advancing efforts to create a con - tinuous greenway loop around the entirety of Manhat - tan In partnership with Motivate, the parent company of Citi Bike, the City has committed to expand Citi Bike to over 12,000 bikes in over 700 stations by the end of 2017, and is exploring a phase three expansion to bring Citi Bike to all five boroughs. DOT is also developing se - cure, high-capacity bicycle parking facilities near transit hubs and expanding the popular bicycle corral program for on-street bicycle parking. The City will continue to work with the State Legislature to create a sensible legal framework to regulate pedal-assist bicycles (e-bikes) to improve safety and allow more New Yorkers to travel by this environmentally friendly mode. Finally, DOT will complete a Bicycle Safety Study and Action Plan, along with new measures to assess bicycling progress, improve data collection, and understand travel decisions. Despite the rapid growth in the city's bicycle network, there are still many areas that lack sufficient bike con - nections. In addition to planned expansions, the City will emphasize an all-ages and abilities core network of protected bike lanes throughout the five boroughs, and the build-out of key connectors linking neighborhoods to transit hubs. The City will explore opportunities to provide high-capacity bicycle parking facilities near transit stops across the city so that more people can readily access the subway and commuter rail systems. The City will work with the State Legislature and at the federal level to expand commuter benefits for bicyclists and bike share users to encourage the mainstream adop - tion of cycling. Ensure that the City's policies prioritize walking, biking, and transit The strategies to encourage surface transit use, walking, and biking will only be successful if the City prioritizes street space for these modes and makes them attractive alternatives to driving. To do so, the City is expanding sidewalks and pedestrian plazas in areas of pedestrian crowding; hosting events that open up streets for pub - lic recreation such as Summer Streets, Weekend Walks, and Shared Streets; building on the Lower Manhattan Shared Streets pilot project; and exploring similar proj - ects in other neighborhoods. In tandem with an im - proved curbside management strategy, the City will also continue to repurpose on-street parking into space for other uses such as commercial loading, bus lanes, bike lanes, public plazas, bicycle parking, and bike share sta - tions. Moving forward, the City will continue to encourage walking, biking, and transit and will integrate planning for these modes into the design and operation of streets and into the City's enforcement efforts. Doing so will justify, underpin, and tie together all future efforts to reallocate street space, manage demand, and ultimately reduce emissions from transportation. As part of this policy, the City aspires to a sustainable mode share of 80 percent by 2050, an increase from 67 percent today and a figure indicated by our analysis to be consistent with an 80 x 50 transportation system. Of this 80 percent sustainable mode share, 40 percent of trips will be made by foot, 10 percent by bike, and 30 percent by transit. The remaining 20 percent of trips in 2050 will still involve vehicles, but a significant number of those trips will shift towards shared rides that more effectively utilize the network by filling empty seats to reduce the total number of vehicles on New York City's streets. The City will also continue to construct bus lanes and protected bike lanes on major streets and explore the expansion of shared streets, based on a suc - cessful pilot in lower Manhattan. Additionally, the City will begin planning for opportunities to create car-free or shared streets in dense areas of the city, in the vein of the downtowns of many global peer cities. Land-use decisions and rules can also influence how New Yorkers live and travel, and the City is committed to promoting growth that supports sustainable, mixed- use, mixed-income communities. Housing New York includes targeted initiatives that identify specific op - portunities for new housing in transit-accessible areas, supported by infrastructure and services, with a level of density and mix of uses that supports and encourages walking and bicycling for neighborhood trips. Leverage technology and data to expand travel options and optimize the transportation network New York City is experiencing record levels of employ - ment, population, tourism, and economic activity, all of which contribute to added congestion on city streets. The City is making efforts to improve real-time traffic 88 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycTransportation Autonomous Vehicles: What Does the Future Hold? Autonomous vehicles (\"AVs\" or \"driverless cars\") are coming, and may completely transform the driving experience as we know it, by smoothing ve - hicular traffic patterns and greatly improving road - way safety. However, the impact of AVs on green - house gas emissions is uncertain. While AVs will almost certainly feature cleaner technology than today's vehicle stock, they may still result in more emissions if vehicle miles traveled skyrockets as a product of the increased convenience and safety of driving. On the other hand, if we guide implementa - tion of this emerging technology correctly, we could see truly remarkable societal benefits and still man - age to reduce transportation emissions. Potential advantages of AVs: Mobility options increase for those unable to drive Crashes, serious injuries and traffic deaths plummet, and we reach Vision Zero AVs are managed by transportation network companies and become integrated with an overall shift toward Mobility as a Service Most AVs are actually a form of on-demand shared ride, and we see improved efficiency compared to today's typical auto occupan - cy of under two people per vehicle Parking demand plummets, and we reclaim a vast amount of curbside space and repur - pose it for more sustainable and public uses Vehicles themselves are completely rede - signed and become new social spaces in their own rightPotential challenges from AVs: Many AVs fall short of coping all of the time with the city's complex traffic environment and thus require distracted drivers to sudden - ly take over vehicle operation, leading to road crashes, injuries, and fatalities Driving becomes so easy that everyone wants to own an AV, and overall VMT skyrockets We mainly continue to drive alone, and we see no improvement and in fact worsening traffic congestion Demand for curbside space dramatically in - creases as pick-ups and drop-offs become much more common for both people and packages Many AVs are roaming our streets with no oc - cupants as they return from dropping off their owners at work, leading to empty vehicles stuck in their own congestion We cater to this new technology and redesign our streets for the benefit of AVs, to the det - riment of walking, cycling, and high-capacity public transport The City, led by DOT and TLC is currently working to evaluate the potential safety, con - gestion, social, environmental, and economic impacts of autonomous vehicles and develop a set of policies for federal and state advocacy and to guide future pilot projects. operations management, but more needs to be done to improve traffic data collection, monitoring, and en - forcement. Meanwhile, new mobility services, such as ridesharing, e-hail taxi services, and car sharing offer the potential to reduce the demand for private motor vehicle ownership and use, but also could spur a move away from more GHG-efficient public transportation. The City will continue to explore how these emerging mobility services might best be regulated and guided to support sustainability goals.The City will continue to make transportation data available to third-party mobile application developers, and generally encourage an open-data environment. We will continue to support MTA's work to update its transit payment technology. There may also be opportunities for the City to explore partnerships with the private sector to foster a seamless \"mobility as a service\" expe - rience that empowers New Yorkers to plan trips across all modes\u2014transit, bike share, rideshare, and others\u2014in real-time and on-demand. We will study examples from other cities that have implemented formal car-sharing Transportation NYC Clean Fleet NYC Clean Fleet is the most comprehensive and ambitious blueprint for municipal fleet sustainability in the nation. Unveiled by May - or de Blasio in December 2015, Clean Fleet expands on NYC Fleet's substantial strides in sustainability by setting concrete targets to reduce its consumption of greenhouse gas-emitting petroleum-based fuels\u201450 percent by 2025 and 80 percent by 2035. In the near term, Clean Fleet committed New York City to add 2,000 electric vehi - cles (EVs) to its sedan fleet by 2025\u2014the largest such commitment of any U.S. city. In less than a year since the announcement of Clean Fleet, the City has increased the size of its EV fleet by more than 60 percent with more than 500 total EVs. In April 2016, the City reinforced its EV commitment by an - nouncing it would only purchase plug-in ve - hicles for all non-emergency sedan orders beginning in fiscal year 2017. This should bring NYC Fleet near 1,000 total EVs by the end of 2017. The Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) is exploring innovative channels to ensure that its sizable EV fleet can charge up, including a solicitation for standalone solar canopies that can charge fleet EVs with renew - able power without relying on the electricity grid. DCAS is also exploring an interagency EV carshare pilot to address congestion in Downtown Brooklyn, where several agencies have active vehicle fleets. NYC Clean Fleet also set forth a vision of displac - ing petroleum diesel with alternative fuels for use in medium- and heavy-duty fleets. With a require - ment that diesel vehicles use biodiesel blends of at least 5 percent (B5) year-round, many agencies were already using B20 during warmer months for their fleets. In support of Clean Fleet, nonemergency ve - hicles are now beginning trials of B20 during colder months and B50 during warmer months. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) has also begun using B10 in its heavy-duty vehicles during summer months. The City is also actively investigating the supply chain, fire safety, and permitting steps that would be required to run portions of the heavy-du - ty fleet on renewable diesel, which can completely replace petroleum diesel in existing diesel engines from the same feedstocks that produce biodiesel.policies and programs, and will adapt them to our cur - rent transportation system, as appropriate, in light of our sustainability goals. The City will likewise explore other opportunities to manage travel demand, such as partnerships with large employers or linking lower-car - bon travel choices to the Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) program. In addition, the City and the U.S. Department of Trans - portation have begun a \"connected vehicle\" pilot proj - ect to test safety applications and vehicle-to-vehicle communication systems. As part of this effort, DOT is developing an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) strategic plan and is expanding transit signal priority systems for SBS. The City will also continue to expand the use of data analytics to support real-time traffic op - erations management and encourage compliance with traffic laws. In addition to saving lives, automated speed enforcement and red light camera programs promote good driving behavior and have a significant impact on keeping the network flowing at a steady pace, which re - duces congestion and emissions. The City will also con - tinue to work with the State Legislature to expand the use of speed and red-light camera enforcement at high- crash areas and near schools, which will also enhance the efficiency of the roadway network. Better manage and price parking to encourage efficient travel choices Through the PARK SMART program, the City has al - ready begun to price curbside parking in commercial areas at variable rates, encouraging efficient levels of turnover and enabling drivers to more easily find park - ing spaces. Following the success of the PARK SMART program, DOT will begin a more comprehensive analysis of the use of metered parking spaces in commercial dis - tricts across the five boroughs. The analysis will inform the development of a 21st-century parking management strategy to increase curb availability for deliveries, cus - tomer parking, and eventually pick-up and drop-off of Sustainable Freight New Yorkers want what they want, when they want it. As a result, local trucks carry goods to residents and businesses all day long. As a city of islands, with the exception of the Bronx, we have limited rail and marine connections to the mainland, and therefore most freight moving through the city is carried on trucks, rather than by rail or ship. New York City needs a reliable and efficient freight network to support our economy as well as the needs of our residents, businesses, and visitors. But the current system is not sustainable\u2014goods movement contributes roughly ten percent of the City's transportation-related GHG emissions, ex - acerbates particulate and ozone pollution, adds to congestion on our streets, increases wear-and- tear on our pavements, and increases risk of vehi - cle crashes. Many of the foundational elements to the 2050 sustainable freight system are already in place. Here's a snapshot of some of the steps already or soon to be underway at City agencies and in collaboration with regional partners: Expand the Hunts Point Truck Replace - ment Program to new fleets and loca - tions\u2014and, if possible, citywide Expand off-hour delivery programs to shift truck deliveries away from peak hours Use technology to expand the enforce - ment of truck parking and delivery zones in congested areas Evaluate the feasibility of zero-emission truck refrigeration units (TRUs) Expand the use of weigh-in-motion sen - sors and cameras to detect overweight trucks and develop strategies to foster a culture of compliance with traffic rules and regulations to mitigate infrastructure dete - rioration and safety challenges caused by overweight trucks Reactivate the South Brooklyn Marine Ter - minal to connect the City to the national rail network, which will create 300,000 square feet of shed space for warehousing, and provide more than 1,000 feet of berthing space for ocean-going vessels Expand the transload facility at 65th Street rail yard in Sunset Park to enhance rail-to- truck cargo movements and reduce \"last- mile\" truck congestion, costs, and pollution Coordinate with the private railroads through the Metropolitan Rail Freight Council to in - crease rail freight; the Council has identified 18 projects that preserve and expand rail freight, such as the preservation and devel - opment of the Bay Ridge Branch in Brooklyn and Queens Study ways to unlock the value of NYC's smaller, secondary waterways (e.g., Newtown Creek, Gowanus, and Eastchester Creek) that are home to many maritime industrial businesses that move over 4.4 million tons of aggregate, fuel, and recyclables each year Study feasibility of Low-Emission Zones to reduce truck emissions in congested areas or in communities that bear a disproportionate impact of truck traffic mplement safety improvements at the at- grade rail crossings in the Maspeth Industrial Business Zone, which will enhance both mo - bility and safety Work with our regional partners to advance implementation of the Cross Harbor Freight Program Freight Movement Photo credit: NYC Department of Transportation91 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Transportationpassengers from shared rides and autonomous vehicles. Adding to these improvements, drivers will soon be able to pay meter fees with their smartphones. Additionally, the City is assessing an expanded off-peak commercial delivery program to decrease the competition for scarce curb space, and exploring the potential for automat - ed enforcement of curb regulations. Looking beyond commercial districts, we will also assess how parking policy can encourage emissions reductions citywide. Support new mobility options that reduce GHG emissions and prepare for autonomous vehicles Shared mobility services such as car share, bike share and shared taxi and for-hire vehicle (FHV) trips are changing how New Yorkers get around. To prepare for continued changes and ensure that they reduce trans - portation emissions, DOT will undertake a shared-use mobility plan to identify the opportunities and challeng - es posed by new transportation services and models. The plan may include evaluating the potential for rideshar - ing services to meet travel needs in areas underserved by the subway, the ability for carsharing to reduce car ownership and improve parking availability, and strate - gies to promote the adoption of low-emission vehicles. The NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) will continue to support the modernization of yellow and green taxis through the licensing of e-hail applications that help match passengers and drivers, including those that support the sharing of rides among passengers. DOT will consider dedicating more curbside parking to carshare and shared mobility services to facilitate a shift away from traditional private vehicle ownership. The City will also continue to work with the Port Authority to accommodate the expanding interest in and potential for ride sharing from the airports. The City has already started to prepare for the signifi - cant technological and cultural shift that may be ahead as technology for autonomous vehicles advances. DOT and TLC are examining the potential safety, congestion, social, environmental, and economic impacts of auton - omous vehicles, and will advocate to State and federal lawmakers for policies that reinforce these consider - ations. This assessment will also guide pilot projects, including the use of the municipal fleet to test self-brak - ing and potentially other automated features as an in - troduction to this technology. The City will focus on the potentially transformative safety and mobility benefits of these technologies, while seeking to mitigate the pos - sible unintended consequence of increasing GHG emis -sions that could result if the emergence of autonomous vehicles generates a spike in vehicle trips. Accelerate purchases of zero-emission vehicles NYC Clean Fleet outlines how City agencies will lead by example and cut vehicle emissions while meeting their operating needs. With more than 29,000 vehicles, the City's procurement decisions can accelerate the devel - opment of the ZEV market and catalyze similar invest - ments by other cities and large fleets. To accelerate the use of ZEV technologies into high-mileage fleets, such as taxis and FHVs, the City will partner with private sector stakeholders to provide high-value electric vehicle (EV) charging, and will advo - cate for State legislation to reduce or waive the existing rental car tax for short-term ZEV FHV rental services. A lack of a robust public infrastructure network to sup - port ZEVs is a major reason their uptake has lagged in New York City.1 While Local Law 130 of 2013 requires that new parking garages and open lots be equipped to accommodate electric vehicle charging equipment for at least 20 percent of parking spaces (thus making them \"charger-ready\"), it does not require the installa - tion of chargers. To begin addressing this barrier, the City is installing additional EV charging stations at its municipal parking lots and fields over the next year. The City will also develop a deployment roadmap that identifies advantageous locations for ZEV-enabling in - frastructure based on factors including likelihood for use by high-utilization fleets, locations of charger-ready parking spaces, and proximity to existing electric dis - tribution infrastructure. We will integrate this analysis into the Community Energy Mapping effort, detailed in the Energy chapter. Additionally, the City will continue to advocate for EV charging rate structures to encour - age the deployment of EVs and enabling infrastructure in a manner that increases the efficiency of the electric distribution system. In collaboration with stakeholders participating in the New York City Electric Vehicle Advisory Committee, formed by DOT pursuant to Local Law 122 of 2013, the City will enhance these efforts to accelerate the adop - tion of ZEVs, and in particular EVs. The advisory com - mittee is composed of representatives from DOT, the NYC Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the NYC Department of Buildings (DOB), the Mayor's Office of Sustainability, City Council, the five Borough Presidents' offices, the EV industry, and transportation 92 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycTransportationand environmental advocates. The City will ask the advisory committee to lead the necessary stakehold - er discussions that will lead to an EV implementation roadmap to drive investment and regulatory reform to support the private sector's transition to ZEVs, and will continue to work with the City Council on these recom - mended measures. Exploration is also underway on the potential for a hy - drogen fueling station pilot in the city to provide ac - cess to fuel cell vehicles. For both the electric charging and hydrogen fueling stations, City agencies are working with the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) to address energy storage technologies, charging issues, and any other safety concerns related to the introduction of these new low-carbon vehicles and fuels. Encourage the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels where electric vehicles are not an option Electric vehicles are presently not an option for most heavy-duty vehicles. Therefore, the City will increase its use of renewable and low-carbon fuels in its own heavy-duty fleet. The City already blends biodiesel into the diesel fuel it uses in trucks and buses. In 2015, 93 per - cent of the diesel fuel used by nearly 10,000 City trucks and buses ran on biodiesel blends ranging from 5 to 20 percent (B5 to B20). The City also uses alternative fu - els such as compressed natural gas (CNG) in some of its trucks and buses where it makes operational sense to do so; roughly 250 heavy-duty vehicles operate on either CNG or propane, including 44 NYC Department of San - itation (DSNY) collection trucks. The use of CNG and biodiesel, depending on the source, in vehicles reduc - es emissions of GHGs as well as particulate matter and other criteria air pollutants relative to petroleum diesel, providing air quality and public health benefits citywide. As a major component of NYC Clean Fleet, the City will expand its focus from biodiesel and CNG to increasing the use of renewable and low-carbon versions of all of the fuels the municipal fleet uses. Where renewable diesel or natural gas can replace conventional fossil fu - els, we will do so. To accelerate the private market for renewable and low-carbon fuels, the City will advocate for a state or regional low-carbon fuel standard, based on the success of the low-carbon fuel standard in Cal - ifornia. In that state, more than half of the natural gas used in transportation comes from renewable sources, including landfills, water treatment facilities, and agri - culture, rather than from fracked fossil sources.Encourage increased efficiency of local and \"last- mile\" freight delivery The City has taken steps to increase the efficiency of local and \"last-mile\" freight delivery. This includes pi - lot projects to incentivize off-peak deliveries, steps to improve curb management and truck parking, and in - novative funding incentives to reduce truck emissions. In particular, the Hunts Point Truck Replacement Pro - gram has funded the replacement of 500 pre-2007, inef - ficient trucks with newer, cleaner models. Looking ahead, DOT's recently released Strategic Plan 2016 will guide the City's investments and planning for future freight policy. The plan considers a range of measures to increase the efficiency and reduce the car - bon footprint of freight movement, including expand - ed camera enforcement of curb loading, an expanded off-hour delivery program, expanded enforcement of anti-idling laws, and increased enforcement of truck weight, size, emissions limits through GPS and other technology innovations. The City will help transition local truck deliveries to the cleanest, most efficient technologies to address long - standing concerns about truck pollution and conges - tion. In particular, the City will study the potential for Low-Emission Zones (LEZs) that limit traditional truck traffic in overburdened neighborhoods and incentivize or require zero- or low-emission \"last mile\" deliveries. LEZs exist in more than 400 European cities, but have not been implemented in the U.S. By adapting Europe - an strategies such as variable emissions-based charges, time-of-day restrictions, and prohibition of the oldest, dirtiest trucks to the New York City context, LEZs could provide both GHG reductions and public health benefits to communities that have borne the disproportionate burden of our current system. The City will also seek funding to extend the Hunts Point Truck Replacement Program into new fleets and locations, expanding this program to address the dirt - iest diesel trucks citywide. The City will consider the suitability of new ZEV and other vehicle technologies for trucks (e.g., electric, hybrid, natural gas, stop-start, and others); new procurement policies to reduce GHGs from municipal government-related deliveries; incen - tives to reduce partial load shipments from private sec - tor deliveries; and strategies to reduce emissions from truck refrigeration unit equipment.93 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50TransportationInvest in rail, maritime, and other infrastructure to increase the efficiency of freight movement DOT, the New York City Economic Development Cor - poration (NYCEDC), and other agencies are advancing a number of approaches to increase freight efficiency using new or existing investments in rail, maritime, and other infrastructure as alternatives to long-haul truck freight. These investments will take trucks off New York City's limited bridge crossings and add valuable options for bulk cargo transportation. NYCEDC and DOT have also increased opportunities to capture new air cargo markets by allowing trucks carrying industry-standard 53' trailers to access JFK's air cargo facilities, support - ing approximately 60,000 jobs in Queens. We will con - tinue to explore opportunities to divert progressively greater shares of freight from trucks to rail, barge, or air through targeted investments and interventions such as those outlined above. To improve the efficiency of air freight, the City will coordinate closely with the Port Authority, including on a demonstration project of zero- and low-emissions ground support equipment, and will undertake a Phase 2 study to identify new opportunities for air cargo. Until now, the City has focused most of its marine and non-road equipment interventions on the reduction of criteria pollutants, such as particulate matter and ni - trogen oxides. Local Law 77 of 2004 requires the use of ultra-low sulfur diesel for any non-road equipment used on City construction projects. Earlier this year, the City's new contract for Citywide Ferry Service requires that vessels be powered by engines meeting or exceed - ing EPA's Tier 3 marine diesel engine emissions stan - dard. Opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from ma - rine and non-road equipment are limited, but the City will take several exploratory steps. We will continue to evaluate the potential to convert marine and non-road equipment to low-emission technologies, such as natu - ral gas, hybrid, electric, and fuel cell powertrains. For example, the City will assess the ongoing implementa - tion of NYCEDC's shore power collaboration with the Port Authority at Brooklyn Cruise Terminal to guide future prospects for providing alternative power to ma - rine vessels at terminals in New York City. The City will also work to develop a program to implement and en - force anti-idling regulations for all non-road equipment operating in the City.Laying the foundation for the future Emissions reductions of 80 percent citywide will require significant action beyond the above initiatives between now and 2050. Building on existing projects and stud - ies, 80 x 50 will require major investments in expand - ing and improving low-carbon transportation networks under the City's control (i.e., those for surface transit, walking, and bicycling) and those under the control of others. Therefore, the City will continue working with State, regional, and federal partners to fund and invest in expansions of the core transit network. We will need to leverage technological shifts that in - fluence mode decisions, optimize the transportation network, and increase uptake of low-emission vehi - cles. The use of cameras, sensors, vehicle monitors, and other devices can provide rich data and analytics to perform real-time traffic management and promote network efficiency. However, the City cannot promote technological adoption on its own. Developing the mar - ket for electric vehicles in New York City, for example, will require working with utilities, building owners, and others to deploy the necessary charging infrastructure to support these vehicles. Changes to the transportation landscape to enable deep GHG emissions reduction, supported by a wholesale shift to mobility as a service, will also require institu - tional changes that increase cooperation and commit - ment between the City and State, regional, and feder - al partners. The City will work to break down barriers between jurisdictions and agencies in pursuit of its emissions reduction goals as well as seek greater con - trol over the funding, regulation, and enforcement of its transportation system. Stronger mechanisms for re - gional planning among these entities are critical, and the City stands ready to take the lead on a comprehen - sive regional agenda for GHG emissions reduction. Regulatory changes will also play a role in reaching 80 x 50 in the transportation sector. The City will need to evaluate the level of regulation needed for shared mobility services and autonomous vehicles in order to ensure that they reduce GHGs and supplement, rath - er than replace, the transit network. The City will also need to work with the State and the federal government to establish fair, transparent, and practical regulatory environments to guide the deployment of emerging technologies to ensure that they operate safely, effi - ciently, and reduce overall VMT. 94 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycTransportationCross-jurisdictional regulatory programs like a low-car - bon fuel standard will have to be adopted to enable the rapid deployment of renewable and low-carbon fuels. Widespread adoption of cleaner vehicle technologies and fuel types will require substantial market changes; until the auto and truck industries see a market for a wide selection of ZEV offerings in every vehicle type, the options will be limited. The City will also need to help the industry create a common approach towards EV charging, which will overcome the current trend of different companies using different charging standards for their vehicles. Similarly, bringing about the sustainable freight system that we will need in 2050 will require the City and its regional partners to invest in a diversity of strategic ap - proaches. These include: New or rehabilitated rail and marine infrastruc - ture to provide an alternative to trucking along congested roadways and river crossings; Transportation Strategies Energy Buildings Transportation Waste Modernize, expand, and reduce crowding on the city's transit system Make walking and biking safer, more convenient options for all New Yorkers Ensure that the City's policies prioritize walking, biking, and transit Leverage technology and data to expand travel options and optimize the transportation network Better manage and price parking to encourage efficient travel choices Support new mobility options that reduce GHG emissions and prepare for autonomous vehicles Accelerate purchases of zero-emission vehicles Encourage the use of renewable and low-carbon fuels where electric vehicles are not an option Encourage increased efficiency of local and \"last-mile\" freight delivery Invest in rail, maritime, and other infrastructure to increase the efficiency of freight movement New strategies for local freight deliveries that meet businesses' and residents' desire for timely and on-demand goods delivery without adding stress to neighborhood streets; New approaches to freight distribution centers, waste transfer stations, and other centrally-locat - ed facilities to reduce impacts of heavy vehicle emissions, particularly in low-income communi - ties; and Cleaner, more efficient engines to power the trucks, locomotives, and marine vessels that car - ry our goods where they need to go. Many governments around the world are grappling with similar institutional, regulatory, and market challenges. To spur the scale of transformation needed to achieve global GHG reduction goals, New York City will contin - ually strive to be a model of sustainable transportation governance for other cities to emulate. 95 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50TransportationThis page left intentionally blank96 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycWasteWaste97 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50 In 2050... We envision that New York City will have already achieved its 2030 Zero Waste goals, eliminating the landfilling of waste from residential buildings as well as commercial establishments and industrial and institu - tional operations. It will be easy and convenient for New Yorkers to minimize the amount of waste they generate and reuse or recycle products. The collection of recycla - bles and organic materials such as food scraps and yard waste, along with the expansion of energy and material recovery from waste, will have spurred economic activi - ty and catalyzed the development of a citywide circular economy. Smart collection routes, cleaner vehicles, and new technologies will also have helped minimize emis - sions from the transport and processing of waste.98 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycWasteAchieving 80 x 50: Waste For the waste sector, achieving 80 x 50 requires the City to fully implement its existing commitments to divert all waste from landfills and to produce enough renew - able energy at its wastewater treatment sites to meet its on-site energy needs. Consistent with the City's Zero Waste goals, reducing GHG emissions from the sol - id waste sector involves reducing the volume of waste generated, collecting food waste (the largest source of waste-related GHG emissions) to make compost or en - ergy, and increasing reuse and recycling of remaining materials. Achieving net-zero energy at the City's waste - water treatment plants requires retrofitting or replac - ing systems for increased efficiency, capturing methane emissions for energy use, and installing new renewable energy systems on its facilities and land. Drivers of GHG emissions Among the four sectors that contribute to GHG emis - sions in NYC, waste is the smallest contributor, mak - ing up four percent of citywide GHG emissions. These emissions are primarily the result of the decay of waste disposed of in landfills and wastewater treatment pro - cesses. Organic waste is the most significant generator of waste-related greenhouse gas emissions. This includes food and yard waste as well as the plant-based materi - als in paper products. When organic materials are land - filled, methane gas is generated as organic materials de - cay in the absence of oxygen. This is significant given that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that methane has a global warming potential 28 to 36 times greater than carbon dioxide.1 Approximately 78 percent of the total emissions at - tributed to the waste sector are the result of methane generated by New York City's landfilled waste. Another 22 percent of total waste-related emissions are from the treatment of wastewater, including the methane gener - ated from the treatment process and the carbon dioxide emissions from the energy used to operate the City's 14 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). For the City's 80 x 50 analysis, GHG emissions related to WWTPs are included in the Waste chapter; however, in the City's GHG Inventory, per the Global Protocol for Commu - nity-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories, the GHG emissions resulting from WWTPs are captured in stationary energy. In addition to waste processing, the local collection and transport of materials to recyclers and end disposal points also contributes to citywide GHG emissions. The NYC Department of Sanitation (DSNY) is responsible for managing residential waste, and private carters col - lect, transport, process and landfill waste for the com - mercial sector. Together, these fleets are responsible for approximately 69,000 MtCO2e; while this is a small con - tribution to overall citywide emissions (0.13 percent); waste hauling operations also impact local air quality, traffic congestion, and overall quality of life. Consistent with the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Green - house Gas Emissions Inventories, the GHG emissions resulting from the collection and transportation of waste are captured in the transportation analysis. Business as usual findings In order to understand what it will take to achieve 80 x 50 citywide, the City first modeled projected GHG re - ductions under a business as usual (BAU) scenario for each sector through 2050. The BAU scenario includes GHG reductions achieved from existing state and feder - al policies, and local policies and initiatives enacted pri - or to 2014. Taking into consideration population growth, economic development, waste composition trends, and the implementation of the New York City Solid Waste Sour ces of Emissions: Waste 78% Landll Methane<1%Biological Treatment of Waste Nitrous Oxide Methane6% Wastewater Treatment Methane3% Wastewater Treatment Nitrous Oxide 9% Wastewater Electricity Use 3% Wastewater Fuel, Natural Gas, & Steam Use Sources of Emissions: Waste99 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50WasteManagement Plan (SWMP), the City expects that emis - sions from waste will be fairly constant between now and 2050, with the majority (78 percent) attributed to landfilled waste. The largest category of New York City's waste stream is organic matter, which includes food, garden waste and plant debris, paper, wood, and textiles. These categories together make up 45 percent of the current waste stream and represent a significant opportunity to reduce emis - sions from landfilled waste by diverting these materials for resource recovery including anaerobic digestion and composting, or\u2014for certain materials\u2014reuse. Since organic material is the most significant gener - ator of greenhouse gases among all waste categories, and since food makes up the largest portion of organic waste, minimizing food waste at the source and reduc - ing the landfilling of food waste through composting and other beneficial disposal methods, such as anaero - bic digestion, will have a significant effect on reducing the total GHG emissions attributed to waste. Anaerobic digestion of food scraps has the potential to provide a biological, non-fossil fuel energy source for district heating systems throughout the city. As described in the Energy chapter, district heating and community energy are priorities for New York City. Citywide emissions projections also reflect the impact of regulations that govern vehicles, including those that transport watste, and their related emissions as dis - cussed in the Transportation chapter. Federal policies that govern air emissions from vehicles will drive trans - portation related emissions reductions. However, lo - cally the full implementation of the SWMP, which em - phasizes the use of rail and barge transport, rather than long-haul trucking, and compliance with Local Law 145 of 2013, which requires all heavy trade waste vehicles to meet 2007 EPA emissions standards by 2020, will also Business as Usual GHG Emissions MtCO2e: Waste 00.51.01.52.02.53.0 Wastewater Fuel, Natural Gas & Steam Use Wastewater Electricity Use In-city Land/f_illed W aste Methane Wastewater T reatment Nitrous Oxide T reatment Methane Composted W aste & Nitr ous Scenario: Projected Waste-Related GHG Emissions Through 2050, in Million Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MtCO2e)Current Composition of NYC's Waste Stream Business as Usual: Waste eam 7%Wood <1%Textiles100 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycWastechanging the way New Yorkers purchase products, and trends in improved packaging are leading to decreased waste related to the products that New Yorkers buy. To - gether, these trends are expected to continue to reduce waste generation volumes per person. With the addition of improved waste collection and disposal processes, emissions from the waste sector will further decrease. Changing consumption patterns, largely attributed to the digital and sharing economies, are leading to a de - crease in per-person waste generation volumes. The adoption of digital media and the use of the internet for the consumption of news, media and online learning has been a strong contributor to decreasing paper waste. Pa - perless transactions also contribute to reducing the vol - ume of newspaper and office paper discarded. Not only are we changing what we consume, we are also changing how we acquire things that we consume. The growth of the sharing economy is enabling individuals to borrow a product instead of owning it directly. For example, with a few smart phone clicks, consumers can now rent a car, tools, and clothing for a certain amount of time. This reduces the need to produce and dispose of new products. When we do purchase things for consuption, we are in - creasingly seeing a shift from the use of virgin materials for producing products to reuse and the use of recycled materials. This circular economy reduces the amount of waste for disposal as products that were once disposed at the end of life can now be reused or repurposed into something new. Finally, advances in packaging materials have resulted in the use of lighter-weight materials like plastics and aluminum in place of glass and steel, which reduces the amount of waste generated per person. More recently, even rigid plastic packaging materials have started to be displaced by the rapidly growing use of flexible packag - ing materials. Beyond shifts in consumption patterns, there are also opportunities to shift the way that New York collects, treats, and disposes of its waste and discarded material. While not a new trend, the use of pressurized vacuum tubes (i.e. pneumatic tubes) for waste collection is be - coming increasingly present in global cities. Pneumatic tube technology has been in use at Roosevelt Island for the past forty years. Waste collection tubes connect the Island's numerous buildings to DSNY's Roosevelt Island Waste Management CycleEconomic CycleManufacture Packaging & Distribution Use End of LifeRecoveredResource Recycling Collection WasteGenerationCircular Economy A circular economy turns away from a \"make-use-dispose\" approach toward initiatives that keep resources in use for as long as possible, extracting the max - imum value from them while in use, then recovering and regenerating products and materials at the end of each service life. Achieving this requires focus on inno - vations in product design and technology, source reduction, reuse, recycling and or - ganics diversion, and advanced efforts to extract materials and value from any re - maining waste - returning these resourc - es to market as inputs to new products and services. contribute to reducing GHG emissions. Additionally, these policies will result in fewer air polluting emis - sions, helping to improve air quality in New York City's neighborhoods and supporting improved public health. Emerging trends In the future, potential increases in waste associat - ed with growth are expected to be offset by waste re - duction trends over the past 20 years that are rapidly changing the way New Yorkers purchase products and the types of waste they generate. Particularly, the rise of the new economies (digital, sharing, and circular) are 101 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50WasteCollections and Compaction Plant, which minimizes the transportation component of waste collection. Advance pneumatic systems allow waste to be separated by type (organics, recycling, and refuse) at the source for direct transfer via underground pipes to waste transfer sta - tions (see next page). Wastewater treatment plants have long been considered locations for treatment and disposal; however, they are now being viewed as resource recovery facilities, pro - viding a critical opportunity to recover energy, heat, and nutrients. The opportunity for heat utilization, nutrient recovery, and renewable energy production is expect - ed to expand the role of these facilities beyond public health protection and environmental compliance. Spe - cific technologies are emerging that could efficiently mine latent heat, energy, nutrients, and other resourc - es that make up the wastewater stream. The move to - ward energy neutrality at the City's wastewater plants will include the increased application of these recovery technologies, in order to mine and return these valu - able resources within the City and outside its borders. For example, utilization of biogas (i.e., methane) pro - duced from the digestion processes of wastewater will be expanded to generate additional heat and power at the City's plants, displacing a significant portion of fuel oil, natural gas, and grid electricity currently used to run these plants. Biogas can also be scrubbed and injected into the local distribution networks to help supply the surrounding communities with biogas for residential and commercial use. In addition, biosolids, the nutri - ent-rich solid waste that remains after the dewatering of the sludge in the wastewater treatment processes, can be treated and used as fertilizer materials or for other beneficial uses. 80 x 50 Roadmap: Waste In the April 2015 release of OneNYC , the City com - mitted to sending zero waste to landfills by 2030 (Zero Waste). To achieve Zero Waste, DSNY is implementing programs that target all sectors\u2014residential, institu - tional, commercial\u2014and all waste streams, plastic bags and Styrofoam, elec - tronics, textiles, and other non-recyclable waste. Once implemented, these initiatives are expected to reduce waste emissions by 850 MtCO2e, which is more than a 55 percent reduction from the 2030 business as usual scenario and accounts for a 30 percent decrease from 2005 baseline waste emissions. OneNYC also includes a City commitment to achieve net-zero energy at all fourteen of the Department of Environment Protection's (DEP) wastewater treatment plants within New York City. Implementing this initia - tive will include expansive integration of energy con - servation measures into capital improvement projects, as well as management of biogas collection and utiliza -Solution Description Market Challanges Breakthroughs in Existing Solutions Centralized Anaerobic DigestionLarge-scale system that uses micro-organisms to break down organic material in the absence of oxygen that can control and harness production of biogas, allowing for the production of energy, while also optimizing biosolids treatment and beneficial use.

Anaerobic digestion of food scraps has the potential to provide a biological, non-fossil fuel energy source for district heating sys - tems throughout the city. The City has already begun a three-year pilot program to process food waste through anaerobic digestion at the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant. As part of this project, the methane gas from this process will be refined into natural gas and pumped into the National Grid system. The City will continue to evaluate opportunities and investments needed to expand food co-digestion at DEP's wastewa - ter treatment plants beyond the Newtown Creek facil - ity. DEP investments to achieve net-zero energy are pro - jected to reduce GHG emissions associated with its wastewater treatment plants by 35 percent by 2030 and almost 80 percent by 2050, compared to the business as usual scenario. This reduction accounts for a 12 percent citywide decrease from 2005 baseline waste emissions. The reductions attributed to implementing Zero Waste and net-zero energy at the City's wastewater treatment plants chart a clear path for the waste sector's role in achieving 80 x 50 citywide. Challenges to address Achieving Zero Waste and shifting to a thriving circu - lar economy depends on high recycling rates; howev - er, New Yorkers currently recycle less than half of the metal, glass, paper, and plastic in their household waste stream. Resident confusion over how to recycle and cur - rent requirements to separate recyclables into multiple bins are among the main barriers to greater participa - tion. While recycling rates have been improving thanks in part to DSNY outreach efforts, the city still has a long way to go. Best practices around the world have demonstrated the success of a combination of outreach, financial incentives, and infrastructure that allows recy - cling to be simple, easy, and convenient. Given the city's dense built environment, including its older building stock, and brimming residential neighborhoods, this is easier said than done. Near-term actions to reduce GHG emissions As part of the implementation of Zero Waste, the City is evaluating efforts to minimize the amount of all waste material generated within the city, advance the citywide circular economy, expand energy and material recovery An 80 x 50 Roadmap: Projected GHG Reductions from the Waste Sector by 2050 2.9 2050 Business as UsualZero Waste Net Zero WWTP All percent reductions are relative to the 2005 Waste emissions baseline103 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 Organics from waste to reduce the impact of waste processing, and reduce emissions from all modes of transportation for all waste streams. Engage all New Yorkers in reducing waste dis - posal to landfills While it is critical to take steps to make recycling eas - ier and organics collection available to more New Yorkers, it is also critical to reduce the components of the waste stream that cannot be readily diverted. GreeNYC, a program of the Mayor's Office of Sustain - ability, leads multiple campaigns to reduce waste, in - cluding the Stop Junk Mail and B.Y.O. campaigns to re - duce waste from paper, single-use shopping bags, coffee mugs, and water bottles. The Stop Junk Mail campaign has successfully reduced paper waste by over seven mil - lion pounds since 2011. The B.Y.O. campaign is also a success, averting 300 million plastic bags in NYC from landfill, increasing plastic water bottle recycling by 28 percent, and having over 15,000 New Yorkers pledge to carry reusable bags, mugs, and water bottles provided by GreeNYC. This program has resulted in a financial savings of over two million dollars to the City and DEP has already provided additional funds to support the campaign. Despite the significant progress from GreeNYC's B.Y.O. campaign, more than 10 billion plastic bags still show up in the waste stream annually. These bags contami - nate the recyclable and organic waste streams, and of - ten end up in local waterways. As part of Zero Waste, City Council adopted legislation that will reduce waste and encourage New Yorkers to bring their own bags by placing a five-cent fee on carryout bags at stores. Based on the experience of other cities, DSNY projects that Pneumatic Waste Management Systems A pneumatic waste collection system is a sustainable waste man - agement system that connects buildings, transportation, solid waste and energy. These systems can collect source-separated refuse from residential and commercial establishments and allow for: processes that treat organics locally through anaerobic diges - tion to produce renewable energy in the form of electricity or natural gas which can be used: to power the treatment process as energy for buildings to heat homes for the production of alternative transportation fuels diverting recyclables to local reuse opportunities, and connecting the remaining waste to rail yards for transportation to facilities that have the technology to cleanly and efficiently convert the refuse into beneficial by-products. These systems demonstrate the successful integration of new tech - nologies and existing infrastructure to capture resources that have traditionally been underutilized. They also provide a model for im - proving the management of source-separated waste in dense urban areas, and enhance fuel security and diversity by providing commu - nity-scale renewable energy while also reducing GHG emissions and criteria air pollutants through more efficient movement of materials. 104 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycWastethis fee could reduce plastic and paper bag waste by ap - proximately 60 percent. The City is working with retail associations and retailers to provide free reusable bags to New Yorkers in advance of this fee going into effect, and periodically in the years to come. Additionally, DEP received a grant to support The Bag Challenge, which will encourage retailers and customers to switch from using single-use bags to reusable bags while also study - ing changes in behavior for more targeted outreach. To reduce marine debris from plastic bags and oth - er waste that often ends up in local waterways, DEP launched the Trash Free NYC Waters Initiative. Early efforts included partnering with GreeNYC's B.Y.O. cam - paign and the Clean Streets = Clean Beaches campaign. Additional outreach highlighting the impact of plastic waste and litter on local waterways is planned for 2017. Minimize waste generated by all City agencies All city agencies are encouraged to take part in efforts to reduce waste and purchase sustainable products. City -wide employees are encouraged to recycle and separate food scraps and organic material for composting. Fur - ther, agency purchases are subject to the City's Environ - mentally Preferable Purchasing program, which started in 2005. Environmentally Preferable Purchasing (EPP) focuses on the human health and environmental impact of goods and products purchased by selecting products that are more environmentally preferable to others. EPP takes into account many factors, such as waste pro - duction, energy and water use, greenhouse gas emis - sions, indoor air quality, recycled and reused content, and the presence of hazardous substances. The EPP laws consist of Local Laws 118, 119, 120, 121, and 123 of 2005. The EPP program also includes packaging reduc - tion guidelines (Local Law 51 of 2011) and green build - ing standards for certain types of capital projects (Lo - cal Law 86 of 2005). Pursuant to the EPP laws, the City developed minimum standards for certain goods and construction products based on their human health and environmental impact. Any City agency procuring one of these goods or products must include specifications in their procurement package that meet or exceed these standards. As part of 80 x 50, this program will continue to be a lever where the City can exert its market power to reduce its waste-related GHG footprint. Giving all New Yorkers the tools for waste prevention and reduction extends to educating the next genera - tion of recyclers in the classroom. In 2015, DSNY, the Department of Education (DOE), and GrowNYC built a strong interagency team to create a zero waste culture NYC students source-separating cafeteria waste at a Zero Waste School Photo credit: NYC Department of EducationGreeNYC BYO campaign poster105 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Wastein our schools. Now, in accordance with the OneNYC commitment, DOE in partnership with DSNY, is rolling out the Zero Waste program at more than 100 schools in fall 2016. Following operational assessments and broad stakeholder engagement this past spring and summer, students and staff at the Zero Waste Schools will imple - ment a strategy that demonstrates how, when recycla - bles and organics are fully separated out of the waste stream, there is really very little left to go in the trash. Launch outreach campaigns to reduce food waste DSNY uses a variety of media to educate New Yorkers on how to properly dispose of their waste materials, in - cluding flyers, stickers, and an interactive website. In ad - dition to providing information about curbside organics collection, DSNY provides tips and schedules for orga - nizations that accept donations of canned and packaged food, and for food scrap drop-off sites. In collaboration with non-profit partners and NYC Service Corps, DSNY also provides ongoing outreach to the neighborhoods that receive curbside organics collection and will con - tinue to expand this outreach as more neighborhoods are added. While diverting organic waste from landfill is essential to reducing waste and GHG emissions, preventing the flow of wasted food is also essential to meeting the City's goals. An efficient, equitable food distribution system, with adequate infrastructure, ensures that all New York - ers have access to affordable, healthy food. The food sys - tem is deeply connected with public health, economic development, and community wellbeing. The Mayor's Office works with partners, including food recovery or - ganizations to recapture edible food for donation and encourage New Yorkers to reduce food waste as part of nutrition and environmental education initiatives. Implement proven incentive-based systems to minimize waste generation In OneNYC , the City committed to developing an equi - table blueprint for Save-as-You-Throw. Such a program would create financial incentives to reduce waste. New Yorkers that produce less waste and recycle more would save money. In 2015, DSNY convened a group of com - munity development, property management, environ - mental justice, labor, and other stakeholders to discuss a potential proposal. In 2016, these stakeholders partic - ipated in focused-topic working groups. Cities such as San Francisco, California, and Seoul, Korea have imple - mented similar strategies that require residents to pay Zero Waste In OneNYC , the City committed to the ambitious goal of sending Zero Waste to landfill by 2030. In conjunction with this goal, the following initiatives were developed. These initiatives not only help the City achieve Zero Waste, but also improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 1. Expand the New York City organics program to serve all New Yorkers by the end of 2018 2. Enhance the City's curbside re - cycling program by offering sin - gle-stream recycling by 2020 3. Reduce the use of plastic bags and other non-compostable waste 4. Give every New Yorker the oppor - tunity to recycle and reduce waste, including at NYCHA housing 5. Make all schools Zero Waste Schools 6. Expand opportunities to reuse and recycle textiles and electronic waste 7. Develop an equitable blueprint for a Save-As-You-Throw program to reduce waste 8.

Over the next several years, DSNY will continue to work with stakeholders to develop this program. Support increasing citywide reuse and donation In June 2016, DSNY launched donateNYC, a program designed to make finding and giving second-hand goods easier for New Yorkers. DonateNYC provides residents with a website and a mobile app to help them search by material and location to find the most convenient place to give or find reusable goods. For local nonprofit orga - nizations in need of donated goods, or businesses look - ing to donate, donateNYC offers an online materials exchange where they can connect, donate and receive reusable goods. The donateNYC partnership program also supports New York City's nonprofit reuse sector. Partner orga - nizations include thrift stores, clothing banks, social service providers, creative arts programs, and com - munity-based reuse programs. Formerly known as Re - useNYC, this partnership is designed as a trade network for local nonprofit donation and reuse programs that accept and locally distribute second-hand items. As the City continues towards its goal of sending zero waste to landfills by 2030, donateNYC partners will help the City reach its goal by providing verifiable data need - ed to assess progress. In 2015, partner organizations di - verted more than 40 million pounds of material from landfills \u2014 creating a reduction of over 60,000 tons of carbon emissions. Partner organizations also served more than 1.3 million New Yorkers last year through family services, housing/sheltering, healthcare, work - force development and food bank programs. Accelerate diversion of recyclable materials from landfills As part of Zero Waste, the City committed to enhance its curbside recycling program by offering single-steam re - cycling by 2020 to make recycling easier for every New Yorker. New York City already has the largest curbside recycling program of any U.S. municipality, but current - ly New Yorkers separate only half of all recyclable ma - terials from their trash. Since 2015, DSNY has worked closely with its recycling vendors to develop a plan to convert curbside collection from dual stream to single stream\u2014so paper, metal, glass, and plastic recyclables are all collected together in the same bin or bag. The City is on track to achieve this initiative and anticipates that significant modifications will be made to vendor re - cycling facilities in the next few years. This effort goes hand in hand with the City's efforts to identify opportu - nities to expand markets for recyclables and move to - ward a circular economy in partnership with the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NY - CEDC) and industry groups. NYCHA is also working to give every New Yorker the op - portunity to recycle and reduce waste. DSNY, NYCHA, and the Mayor's Office have partnered to launch NY - CHA Recycles! In just over a year, more than 1,600 NY - CHA buildings now participate in the program, which includes installation of recycling bins, staff training and resident outreach, and ramp up of collection service. All NYCHA buildings will actively participate in the NY - CHA Recycles! program by the end of 2016. GrowNYC is training all NYCHA residents on separating recyclables and putting materials in the correct bins. GrowNYC also launched the Environmental Ambassadors Program, a program that trains volunteer NYCHA residents to be - come community recycling experts who will continue recycling education at NYCHA moving forward. In further support of the City's OneNYC and Zero Waste goals, the City is launching a public-private partnership that unleashes the emerging economic potential of New York City's circular economy through collabora - donateNYC mobile app Source: NYC Department of Sanitation107 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50Wastetions that foster new approaches to policy, design, and practice. NYCEDC, DSNY, and the NYC Mayor's Office of Sustainability (MOS) are partnering with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a non-profit organization de - voted to advancing circular economy solutions for in - dustry and government, to explore opportunities for in - novation and new enterprises across multiple New York City industries. The partnership will support design innovation and commercialization through coordinat - ed efforts with City agencies, local universities, and the private sector to address urban challenges and develop circular economy solutions for New York City. Capture organics and ensure sufficient capacity to facilitate beneficial reuse in both the residen - tial and commercial sectors The City has been expanding its organics program to reach the OneNYC goal to serve all New Yorkers by the end of 2018. In 2015, DSNY expanded curbside organ - ics collection by more than 50,000 households and is now serving more than 700,000 residents. By the end of 2016, New York City will have the largest curbside or - ganics collection program in the country. At the same time, DSNY is introducing curbside organics collection in high-rise buildings throughout Manhattan, continu - ing annual collection of Christmas trees for diversion, and will resume the seasonal leaf collection program in the fall of 2016. To date, the public interest and partici - pation in the curbside program are encouraging signals to the City that New Yorkers are willing to adopt this practice. Ensuring capacity to process the city's organic waste is central to the program's rollout. In 2017, DSNY will upgrade its Staten Island Compost Facility to improve capacity to compost food scraps and yard waste collect - ed in the borough. DSNY has also signed new contracts with regional processors to ensure adequate organics processing capacity as the program grows. In addition, DEP, in partnership with Waste Management, has begun a three-year demonstration project that will co-digest up to 250 tons of organic waste per day at the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, to be converted to renewable biogas and biosolids. Construction of the project is complete and initial testing and processing has begun. In 2015, DSNY adopted rules that designate the first set of covered establishments that must comply with the commercial organics mandate, Local Law 146 of 2013. Beginning August 2016, all stadiums and arenas, large food manufacturers and wholesalers, and hotels with more than 150 rooms are required to source separate and divert their food waste for beneficial use. Enforce - ment will commence in early 2017. Analysis is underway to determine whether there is adequate processing ca - pacity to expand the subset of businesses that need to comply with the law going forward. In addition, the City has more than 225 community compost sites across all five boroughs, and the NYC Compost Project offers annual courses for individuals interested in composting at home or in community gardens. This year, the Business Integrity Commission (BIC) announced a pilot program to allow acceptable entities to use non-motorized vehicles to divert organ - ic waste for local businesses and to waive carter license fees for small community composting organizations that collect organic material from commercial estab - lishments for the purposes of composting it locally. Local Law 146 of 2013 covers businesses that account for about half of all commercial food waste in New York City. After DSNY completes phasing-in all of the estab - lishments covered by that law, the City will work with City Council to expand the law to require other types of food service establishments to beneficially use their organic waste. NYC organics collection bins ready for DSNY curbside pickup Photo credit: NYC Department of Sanitation108 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenycWasteTo support the expansion of organics processing city - wide, the City needs to develop additional organics sorting and processing capacity in NYC and the metro - politan region. While some of this may occur centrally, the City is also seeking to support safe, smaller-scale anaerobic digestion. Therefore, DEP will develop spec - ifications for grease interceptors and other potential pretreatment equipment required to treat the discharge from on-site waste systems. DEP will also conduct in - spections to ensure that grease interceptors are properly operated and maintained, and it will develop discharge characteristics and requirements for these systems. If needed, DEP will also develop discharge characteris - tics and requirements for community-scale anaerobic digestion projects to integrate into district heating and electric generation. Expand energy recovery from wastewater pro - cessing operations DEP has been moving forward its commitment to achieve net-zero energy at the City's fourteen waste - water treatment plants. The agency will develop a stra - tegic energy plan to continue to move toward net-zero energy. This will include the commencement and com - pletion of an Energy Neutrality Study, integration of state of good repair and energy conservation measures analysis, and pursuit of cost effective renewable energy projects, among other studies, initiatives, and improve - ments. DEP has completed energy audits at each waste - water treatment plant to determine how much energy must be generated to close the energy gap and is de - veloping a plan to reduce energy consumption and gen - erate renewable energy on-site. Design is underway at the North River Wastewater Treatment Plant to install a 12MW cogeneration system. This system will use a com -bination of digester gas produced on site and natural gas to generate electricity to meet the plant's base electrical demand, while recovering enough heat for the plant's heating needs. This project will optimize use of biogas, natural gas, and electricity to run plant operations and offset over 1.7 million gallons of fuel oil annually. DEP is also evaluating additional energy efficiency, GHG reduc - tion, electric generation, and renewable energy options at all DEP facilities. DEP's central policies and strategies related to manag - ing water demand, restoring wetlands, installing green infrastructure, and protecting forested lands also have GHG benefits. To quantify the benefit to the City, DEP developed a model that provides project-specific GHG impacts that result from lower electrical and fuel usage for system operation and maintenance, decreased flow to treatment facilities, reductions in leakage, and direct carbon sequestration. The tool, developed as part of the 2016 Water-Energy Nexus Study, demonstrates which current and planned programs will provide the greatest GHG and energy demand reductions and will be inte - grated into capital project planning and prioritization. Reduce emissions from the collection and dis - posal of commercial waste In August 2016, DSNY and BIC released the results of a study of the city's private carting industry. Private cart - ing companies, licensed by BIC, collect more than three million tons of waste and recyclables per year from the city's restaurants, hotels, offices, and other commercial establishments. The Private Carting Study, first commit - ted to in OneNYC, found that establishing commercial waste collection zones could reduce truck traffic associ - ated with commercial waste collection by 49 to 68 per - cent and reduce GHG emissions by 42 to 64 percent. Over the next two years, DSNY and BIC will work with a broad group of stakeholders including businesses, the private carting industry, and environmental justice ad - vocates to develop an implementation plan for commer - cial waste reform in New York City. The plan will layout a framework for establishing commercial waste collec - tion zones that will improve customer service standards, achieve the City's environmental goals, set clear stan - dards for worker safety, and allow for new investments in recycling infrastructure and cleaner trucks, thereby dramatically reducing GHG emissions and improving air quality.2 Anaerobic digestion facility at Newtown Creek WWTP Photo credit: NYC Department of Environmental Protection109 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 50WasteLaying the foundation for the future Our analysis shows that the Zero Waste program, togeth - er with DEP's net-zero energy commitment, provides a clear path for significantly reducing waste-related GHG emissions. DSNY is already growing its organics collec - tion program and working to increase recycling, which addresses the key materials that generate the majority of waste-related GHG emissions. In support of these ef - forts, the City also has a number of initiatives underway to facilitate the adoption of technologies and solutions that support 80 x 50, including the pilots and studies described above. However, additional work lies ahead to understand the economic, environmental, and social costs and benefits as well as to develop the regulatory framework that will guide safe and equitable installation of the most promising technologies. Greater adoption of GHG-reducing waste management solutions also requires education and partnership with community organizations, property owners, and the general public to change perceptions. For example, technologies associated with the use of waste to gen - erate energy are equated with outdated incineration technologies that have been banned in the city since the 1980s. Today's waste-to-energy technologies are far more advanced and must meet strict health and safety requirements. Regulators need to work together with industry leaders and communities to understand the ap - propriate conditions for installing safe technologies and use these guidelines to create clear, streamlined regula - tions and processes to guide their deployment. Finally, the private sector needs to play a role in greater deployment of GHG-reducing waste strategies, includ - ing anaerobic digestion and composting, and imple - menting more sustainable practices. Clear regulations will support investment of additional organics process - ing and supporting infrastructure for the city's waste, but private waste management companies can also adopt route optimization strategies, vehicle upgrades, and other strategies to further reduce their GHG foot - prints. These efforts must be supported by waste reduc - tion and better source separation efforts by businesses and individuals citywide. Waste Strategies Energy Buildings Transportation Waste Engage all sectors in reducing waste disposal to land - fills Minimize waste generated by all City agencies Launch outreach campaigns to reduce food waste Implement proven incentive-based systems to mini - mize waste generation Support increasing citywide reuse and donation Accelerate diversion of recyclable materials from land - fills Capture organics and ensure sufficient capacity to facilitate beneficial reuse in both the residential and commercial sectors Expand energy recovery from wastewater processing operations Reduce emissions from all modes of transportation for all waste streams110 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50The Role of New Yorkers One of the most valuable assets the city has in reaching our 80 x 50 goal is our residents. The everyday choices New Yorkers make, like whether to weatherize, drive, take public transit, recycle, or adjust their thermostat, add up\u2014and fast. Through voluntary action, the city's residents can drive significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. GreeNYC is dedicated to engaging New Yorkers in adopting these high-impact actions. GreeNYC is a sophisticated marketing and data- driven program that aims to change the behaviors and thought processes of New Yorkers over time through strategic, multi-media education campaigns, events and partnerships. With a strong brand supported by the recognizable and accessible \"Birdie\" mascot, initiatives have included encouraging residents to stop car engine idling, using air conditioners more efficiently in summer months, using energy efficient lighting, drinking tap water, biking to work, reducing paper consumption by opting out of unwanted catalogs and increasing the use of reusable bottles, mugs and shopping bags. GreeNYC uses a multi-disciplinary approach, combining marketing, behavioral research, climate psychology and behavioral economics to engage residents to change behavior to reduce GHG emissions from the city's largest emitting sectors- -buildings, energy supply, transportation, waste- -and other environmental topics. It measures environmental impacts of campaigns in addition to more traditional measures of engagement, and relies on thriving partnerships with corporate partners, non-governmental institutions, and a diverse range of small businesses to achieve its goals. This, coupled with a strong brand adopted across multiple City agencies, allows GreeNYC to not only connect with the public to achieve meaningful results, but to arm New Yorkers with the right tools to make a difference. The GreeNYC Brand The GreeNYC brand was conceived with the intention to shift away from using the shaming, guilt, and fear- inducing approaches that have been commonly used to drive environmental behavior change, and thereby increase engagement and appeal beyond those already inclined toward green behavior. To increase the accessibility of the brand, the mascot \"Birdie\" was created. Birdie is designed not as an authority on all things environmental, but instead as a New Yorker, engaging in the behaviors he is encouraging. In addition to being featured graphically in GreeNYC materials, Birdie also represents GreeNYC at events in the city to build awareness and participation. New Yorkers have had an overwhelming positive response to the brand. A 2015 survey found that 70 percent of New Yorkers who saw the \"B.Y.O.\" campaign reported it made them feel \"informed,\" \"happy\" and \"grateful.\" That same survey found that almost half of all New Yorkers were familiar with the mascot's image, a demonstration of Birdie's success as representative of 50The Environmental Impact of Everyday New Yorkers GreeNYC has pioneered a data-driven approach to public education that is coupled with the successful GreeNYC brand and strategy. This has enabled the city to effectively engage New Yorkers in taking on actions that have had measurable impacts on our environment, emphasizing the idea that New Yorkers' actions can help realize policy goals or fill in the gaps created by absent or recently initiated policies. Moreover, GreeNYC's efforts have highlighted that individual actions can generate impact quickly and at a lower cost than technological or infrastructure interventions. The fact that New Yorkers already view themselves as leading agents of change along with local government demonstrates the need to continue and grow the effort to engage and support New Yorkers in living more sustainably. Early on, the Mayor's Office recognized that decisions the city's 8.5+ million residents make about how they consume and discard goods, move around the city, use energy and water have a tremendous impact on citywide GHG emissions and environmental quality. In some cases, the City can mandate residents to change behaviors, but many of the steps New Yorkers can adopt to improve the environment of the city are voluntary. Through residents' participation, GreeNYC has achieved gains that complement strategies in policy, infrastructure and law enforcement. Multiple surveys have shown New Yorkers see themselves and local government as the entities most responsible for improving the city's environment. GreeNYC exists at this intersection and deploys an accessible and positive brand coupled with compelling data- driven messaging to engage residents and achieve measurable environmental benefits. Moving Forward Towards 80x50 Moving forward, GreeNYC will continue to research, plan, implement and measure the impacts of strategic behavior change campaigns. GreeNYC will continue to collaborate with City agencies and outside partners to educate and influence the public on their ability to change the behaviors. GreeNYC will continue to do behavioral impact research to identify high-impact target actions, messaging strategies, engagement strategies and tools for environmental impact assessment. GreeNYC has distributed over 30,000 reusable bags to New Yorkers who pledge to consume fewer plastic bags.

The City is hard at work imple - menting the climate policies and programs will that put us on the path to 80 x 50. Our roadmap highlights the challenges to reaching 80 x 50, particularly in a dense, urban environment, as well as the opportunities that ex - ist to transform our city in the face of climate change. To guide our next steps, the City will work to ensure that all New Yorkers will benefit from the economic opportuni - ties that will come with the transition to a low-carbon future. By: (1) supporting the development of the work - force, (2) fostering emerging technologies, (3) spurring the expansion of new industries locally, and (4) working together, we can ensure that we reach 80 x 50 and create a strong and just future for New York City. 1. We will create new green job opportunities 80 x 50 is an opportunity to grow a dynamic and in - clusive economy and to make the city more resilient against climate change. We will ensure New York City's workforce can support and participate in our low-car - bon future. We will work with partners to ensure that ar - chitects, engineers, and design professionals are trained to design for holistic building energy performance and contractors and tradespeople can construct high perfor - mance buildings. We will also support emerging clean energy entrepreneurs and facilitate training to develop a workforce to install and maintain clean energy tech - nologies. As new technologies take hold, including solar PV, anaerobic digesters, and electric vehicles, a high- skilled workforce will be in increasing demand. We will continue to work with partners to leverage the creation of training and job opportunities to improve wages and increase skills among New Yorkers most in need of eco - nomic opportunity. 2. We will adopt promising technologies Since we cannot predict future innovations, New York City's Roadmap to 80 x 50 is based on technologies available today. However, the City plays a key role in the adoption of new and emerging technologies and helps to guide deployment through thoughtful regulations. We will continue to test these technologies on our own assets, including our buildings, fleet, and land. The City will also look to expand innovative new strategies in - cluding carbon sequestration, which has the potential to create net-negative emissions. We are committed to catalyzing the market by sharing the results of studies, supporting local clean tech entrepreneurs, and using our own purchasing power for technology with proven cost and energy efficiency benefits. 3. We will spur new local industries New York City will continue to be a global hub for en - ergy efficiency and clean energy technology through NYCEDC initiatives, such as UrbanTech NYC and Ap - plied Sciences NYC. These initiatives will support the creation of thousands of new jobs and bring a cadre of highly skilled professionals, further establishing New York City as a global leader in sustainable urban inno - vation. 4. We will work together We can all make simple changes in our homes and life - styles that will help us achieve 80 x 50. The decisions we make about goods we consume, and how we dispose of them, how we purchase and use appliances, and the Grand Central Tech Photo credit: NYC Economic Development Corporation Shared Streets at Bowling Green Photo credit: NYC Department of Transportation 114 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50temperature at which we keep our homes can have a significant impact. Through strategic and data-driven marketing efforts, GreeNYC empowers New Yorkers to make smart decisions that will achieve meaningful im - pacts. GreeNYC is the City's public education program that empowers New Yorkers to take actions to live more sustainably, which can save residents money, improve personal comfort, and help the City's overall GHG re - duction goals. GreeNYC uses a data-driven approach to identify target audiences, create messaging and art - work, design media plans, develop partnerships, and measure results. Future GreeNYC campaigns will help New Yorkers reduce waste from food, paper, and plas - tics; take simple steps to weatherize their homes; use appliances more efficiently; switch to more efficient light bulbs; adjust thermostats; unplug chargers and electronics when not in use; and purchase more energy efficient appliances. The City will also continue to make changes to its own buildings and operations to reduce its GHG impact and encourage its employees to take actions in the office and at home. For example, employees are encouraged to \"burn calories, not energy\" by taking the stairs as often as possible instead of the elevators and to recycle and compost their waste. The City will evaluate and prioritize strategies and policy options necessary for 80 x 50 by their ability to achieve cobenefits across all four lenses of OneNYC . Co- benefits will include affordability, health and wellbeing, reliability of utilities and services, adaptation, economic opportunity, diversification and flexibility of services, and access for all New Yorkers. To encourage continued engagement with New York City residents and start a conversation about the chal - lenges and opportunities to achieving 80 x 50, the City will develop an interactive, online educational tool. Once built, the interactive tool will enable residents and the general public to create their own roadmap to 80 x 50 for New York City. Drawing on the City's 80 x 50 anal - ysis, users will be able to create different combinations of strategies to reduce GHG emissions from the city's energy supply, buildings, transportation, and waste and visualize the projected outcomes of their choices. We will continue to update this roadmap as part of OneNYC Technologies, regulations, and markets are rapidly changing. To ensure the roadmap remains relevant, it must be dynamic. Therefore, progress toward 80 x 50 will be captured in the annual OneNYC progress reports and our analysis and assumptions will be updated every four years as part of the OneNYC update. By driving our progress as part of OneNYC , we will create a more sus - tainable, more resilient, and more equitable city. New Y orkers deserve nothing less.

Sustainable modes currently account for 67 percent of trips within New York City. Thermal Energy Storage (TES) Technologies that make it possible to store thermal energy for consumption at a later time. By creating a delay between the production and consumption of heating and/or cooling, TES allows renewable sources of heat to be accessed at the optimal time for production. Transportation Network Companies (TNCs)Companies that provide a platform to connect customers with drivers via websites and/or mobile apps. 125 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF)A centralized air source heat pump (ASHP) system that has the ability to modulate and meet a building's heating and cooling needs by different zones within a building. This prevents the common, but inefficient, practice of reheating chilled air. Vision Zero A citywide commitment to reduce and ultimately eliminate all traffic-related injuries and deaths that occur on city streets. This ambitious goal is being met through expanded enforcement against dangerous moving violations like speeding and failing to yield to pedestrians, new street designs and configurations to improve safety, broad public outreach and communications, and a sweeping legislative agenda to increase penalties for dangerous drivers and give New York City control over the safety of its streets. Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT)A measurement of miles traveled by vehicles within a specified region for a specified time period. Water Benchmarking The measurement of water consumed by a building or group of buildings over a set amount of time. Water Source Heat Pumps Systems that use the relatively stable temperature from large bodies of water to provide heating and cooling for buildings. This term is also used to refer to heat capture systems that utilize water loops that circulate through buildings and districts. Water source heat pumps can also be deployed as a hybrid system in a building using a central boiler to heat water and a heat pump system tapping into the boiler's hot water supply. Watt A watt is used to express the rate of energy conversion or transfer with respect to time. A watt is defined as one joule of energy per second. Watt-hours A measurement of energy describing the total amount of electricity used over time. Watt-hours are a combination of how fast the electricity is used (watts) and the length of time it is used (hours). 126 80 x 50 nyc.gov/onenyc80 x 50Directory of Abbreviations 127 nyc.gov/onenyc 80 x 5080 x 50BEEx Building Energy Exchange BIC City of New York Business Integrity Commission BOMA NY Building Operators Management Association NY BPL CUNY Institute for Urban Systems Building Performance Lab Con Edison Consolidated Edison, Inc.

Based on updated 2014 GHG emissions, originally reported in the Inventory of New York City Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2014 (published April 2016). Through the 80 x 50 analysis, more rigorous methodologies for repre - senting transportation and waste emissions were identified. These methodologies were applied to both the 2005 baseline and 2014 data for the Transportation and Waste sectors, and formed the basis of the 80 x 50 analysis. These changes reduced the share of citywide GHG emissions attributable to energy use in buildings, while the total magnitude of building-based GHG emissions remained the same. Methodology 1.

To evaluate energy affordability, a composite index was developed that includes the NYC-adjusted poverty rate, rent-burden, and energy-cost burden, from the NYC Center for Economic Opportunity, NYU Furman Center, and an analysis of US Census Bureau data, respectively. For air quality, data sources include annual average PM2.5 and rate of asthma hospitalizations from the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). For heat vulnerability, data sources include the Heat Vulnerability Index developed by DOHMH, as well as the number of nursing homes and adult care facilities per community district, from the NYC Department of City Planning's PLU - TO dataset. As noted in the introduction, additional data is being integrated into the analysis and work is ongoing. Due to data privacy concerns, results of the analysis are shown at the community-district scale. Buildings: 1.

The NYC Building Code defines a substantial improvement as \"any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has sustained substantial damage, any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed.\" The term does not, however, include either: A. Any project for improvement of a building required to correct pre-FIRM health, sanitary or safety code violations identified by the commissioner, the Fire Commissioner, the Commissioner of Housing Pres - ervation and Development, or the Commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene, and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or B. Any alteration of a historic structure provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 11. Lovins, A., Lovins, H., Hawken, P.
