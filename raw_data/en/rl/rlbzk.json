However, this is likely to slightly diminish due to the integration of distant technologies and remote therapy delivering which eliminate the need for physical presence of the customer significantly increasing the reach of the individual therapy provider. E-training is another significant method of treating patients with alternative medicine and works by different technological mediums like telephonic medication, video therapy and instructional documentation etc. Nowadays, various governments are offering distance courses to improve the exposure of the practitioners to the alternative medicine therapies in an attempt to promote alternative medical tourism.

Funds allotted to Natural Medicine Research:- Funding's for Natural and Herbal Medicine The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds and conducts research to help answer important scientific and public health questions about complementary health approaches. NCCIH works to determine what is promising, what helps and why, what doesn't work, and what is safe. Funding for Research on Complementary and Alternative Medical Approaches (NIH) Visualizing your tumor as an enemy base being fired upon by your body's fleet of jet fighters or having tiny needles inserted all over your body may sound like strange ways to treat disease, but more and more often, patients are turning to unconventional treatments for a variety of ailments either instead of, or in addition to, mainstream medical practices. Funding's for Traditional & Herbal Medicine As attention & public funding for [i](https://traditionalmedicine.conferenceseries.com/) [nternational traditional and herbal medicine research](http://www.conferenceseries.com/alternative-healthcare-meetings) collaborations grows, more detailed analysis of ethical matters in this research is warranted. Scant literature has addressed selected issues such as informed consent & independent review associated to [traditional and herbal medicine research](https://traditionalmedicine.conferenceseries.com/).6,7 Here we apply a practical, comprehensive & widely accepted ethical framework to [international traditional and herbal medicine research](https://traditionalmedicine.conferenceseries.com/). We examine in detail difficult questions related to social value, scientific validity and favourable risk benefit ratio. We conclude with implications for upcoming research in this field, focusing on the importance of collaborative partnership. Funding NIH [National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine](https://traditionalmedicine.conferenceseries.com/) Budget Mechanism $127,930 (Dollars in Thousands) It is estimated that Europe alone annually imports about 400,000 tonnes of [medicinal plants with an average market value](http://www.conferenceseries.com/alternative-healthcare-meetings) of US$ 1 billion from Africa and Asia. But what do we really know about the efficacy of such interventions? Anecdotal evidence suggests that some complementary and alternative practices work, but very few of these treatments have been studied systematically. This is precisely why two different entities, the Office of Cancer Complementary and Alternative Medicine (OCCAM) and the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), have been created within the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
