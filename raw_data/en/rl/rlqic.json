Our approach is to use experiments to understand the fundamental principles underlying these problems, to develop simple computational models based on these insights, and to test the models through structure prediction and design. We strive to continually improve our methodology by iterating between computational and experimental studies. The successful application of our computational prediction and design method, ROSETTA, is illustrated in a few recent examples: (i) We used computational protein design methods to create an artificial globular protein with a novel fold. Experimental characterization of Top7 showed that it is extremely stable, and the x-ray crystal structure is strikingly close to the design model. These results suggest that new proteins can be designed with atomic level accuracy, and current work is aimed at using these techniques to design new proteins with novel functions. (ii) We have redesigned protein-protein interaction specificity and demonstrated that the specificity changes hold both in vitro and in vivo. (iii) Ab initio protein structure prediction. We produced de novo structure predictions of unprecedented accuracy in the recent CASP4 and CASP5 international blind tests of protein structure prediction methods.
