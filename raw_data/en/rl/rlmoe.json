Using Western and Eastern medicine in conjunction can often lead to the best health results, but there is one aspect all types of medicine have in common. That common factor is touch. The healing power of touch is not to be underestimated as a powerful source of healing, although it is often overlooked. Touch itself is an ancient form of healing that permeates various religions and societies, and that is gaining attention today in the form of massage, reiki, and acupuncture. It is universally acknowledged that touch can simultaneously ease pain, lessen anxiety, promote healing and hope, and help one to take the obstacles in life in stride. An instantly lowered heart rate and dropped blood pressure are just two of the physical benefits of touch. Psychologically, touch relaxes the mind as well as the body. Similar to socializing a puppy with a lot of physical activity, making it a point to get massages or touch therapy can help to subconsciously lessen a person's suspicious or tense nature and promote a comfortable and warm demeanor in the patient. Comfort and care can often be best expressed in a silent manner with the use of touch. Promoting physical contact in your life can be as simple as giving more handshakes or reading to children and grandchildren while sitting next to one another rather than across the room. Giving goodnight kisses to family members, hugs to friends, and even placing a hand on the shoulder of someone in grief can make a difference. In Oriental medicine, touch is a powerful component of the practice. Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation which is administered by \"laying on hands,\" showcasing the practitioner's healing touch. Tui na is a Chinese hands-on body treatment that involves acupressure (pressure by the hands on the same points on the body used during acupuncture) and strives to bring the body into balance. And, of course, there is traditional massage work, a consistent success in the calming of the mind, body, and spirit.
