Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are awaiting FDA approval with about 95% effectiveness. Soon, both vaccines will be fully evaluated by the FDA and our panel of ex perts here in Rhode Island. We have been planning for this for months. When we have a vaccine that the doctors, researchers, and scientists tell us is safe, we'll be ready to distribute it as quickly as is safely possible. To hear more about RI's vaccine p lanning, watch the quick eight -minute video . Right now, w e're planning for every scenario and developing different distribution models based on the allocations of vaccine that we expect to come to Rhode Island. We're already working with hospitals and other health care providers to ensure they have the supplies and personnel to receive, store, handle, and administer both versions of the vaccine. We know that initial supplies of vaccine will be very limited, but that it will be coming soon. From our planning conversations with our federal partners and the manufacturers, it's looking like we could receive roughly 10,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine as early as the middle of this month, and 19,000 doses from Moderna about a week after that. That's not going to flip the switch on COVID -19 in Rhode Island \u2014 in a state of 1 million people, 29,000 doses will only go so far, particularly when you consider that every person needs two doses before they're fully vaccinated. But we are ready to hit the ground running and distribute these vaccines as quickly and safely a s possible to our health care providers. You can see our draft blueprint for distributing the vaccine here [r20.rs6.net], and we are continuing to consult the CDC and Rhode Island experts in developing this plan. The vaccine is going to come into Rhode Isl and over the course of months, not weeks. And we're all going to need two doses. It's tempting to think that once the vaccine arrives, COVID -19 will be a thing of the past. But that's not how it will work. Masks are still going to be part of our lives well into 2021, we're still going to need social distancing, and we're still going to have to be careful about the number of people we're around. If we stay serious about following the rules now, we can all look forward to a time next year when COVID -19 is in the rear -view mirror.

EOHHS is currently implementing Phase I of this effort . Phase 1 focuses on the goal of enhancing support to help Rhode Islanders understand all options available to the m for Long -Term Services and Supports (LTSS) before they apply for services . The proposed centerpiece of Phase I is to implement a statewide network to provide Person -Centered Options Counseling (PCOC) to ensure that every Rhode Islander has help to decide whether LTSS is necessary and, if so, which service options best suit their needs. You can provide feedback on Phas e I implementation activities as well as recommendations for improvement. There are three ways you may provide feedback to EOHHS regarding the Phase I implementation : 1) Webinar : You are invited to participate in a virtual community meeting to review this project and provide input. See below for details. 2) Survey : EOHHS will also release a web -based survey to stakeholders for more feedback regarding Phase I activities. EOHHS anticipates emailing a link to this survey after the webinars are complete. 3) Email : If you are unable to attend the webinar, please provide any other feedback that you may have to OHHS.LTSSNWD@ohhs.ri.gov by December 28, 2020.

Your input is invaluable as a key community par tner in Rhode Island. What is Person -Centered Options Counseling (PCOC)? PCOC is an interactive , person -directed decision - support process . PCOC supports individuals to make informed choices about long term settings and programs that are available to them. PCOC is available before or after eligibility for LTSS programs has been determined. What is LTSS? LTSS stands for Long-Term Services and Supports . It covers a range of service s to help people live more independently by assisting with personal and healthcare needs and activities of daily living. It can also provide social and employment supports. LTSS can be provided at home, in community -based settings, or in facilities such as nursing homes . LTSS is administered across multiple State agencies . 3 12/11/2020 How Are You Doing?

We're sharing her remarks below. Good Morning everyone and thank you for inviting me to spea k today about the significance of the words we choose. Words play an important role. They have meaning, and they convey implied thoughts and attitudes beyond their strict definitions. They have the power to build up and tear down, and when not used with ca reful thought, they can distort what we really want to say or what we intended to say . We know that we would never use words that discourage people with heart disease or cancer from seeking help by couching their disease in negative connotations. But, whe n we refer to someone with a drug issue as an \"addict,\" a mentally ill person as \"crazy,\" or a person with a disability as a \"cripple\" we are using a negative implication. We are inferring that their lives aren't as valuable and productive as ours, when ev ery life is valuable. We need to use language that encourages those with substance use conditions to seek help. As others have said, individuals with substance use disorder are less likely to seek help when they think others will look down on them or see their struggle as the result of bad choices or moral failure. This conversation today has shown us that we do not need to reinvent the wheel. There are guidelines that are readily available, and we ask that everyone commit to following them. We know it is the right thing to do. It will help individuals living with mental illness, substance use conditions, or those with an intellectual or developmental disability to feel that they can speak up and seek help. I do not think it is an understatement to say that this could make the difference in someone's life. At the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities & Hospitals, one of the many things we do is work with Regional Prevention Task Force Coalitions, which function as the \"feet on the g round\" in our communities ensuring that the strategies and programs developed at the federal and state levels reach every city and town. We have asked that the regional coalitions start by attending today's workshop, and moving forward, BHDDH will work wi th RICARES to provide training for the regional coalitions on respectful language, and the coalitions will follow up with local media to promote the adoption of the AP guidelines. We are also encouraging partnerships between the coalitions and Recovery Com munity Centers to follow up jointly with local media, as a way of promoting wellness, positive behavioral health, community connectedness, hope and recovery. By opening this dialogue, we will be reinforcing what has been discussed here today. Our Behaviora l Health and Developmental Disabilities Services staff members are very cognizant about the language we use to ensure that every Rhode Islander knows we value and place importance on the health and accomplishments of all. We are committed to making sure th ere is no discrimination or shame for anyone who may have challenges in their lives. Rather, everyone should have the opportunity to make the choice to seek help without the fear of an implied discriminatory bias. Thank you again for the opportunity to tak e part in today's discussion.

The UDHR is a milestone document that proclaims the inalienable rights which everyone is entitled to as a human being. Available in more than 500 languages, it is the most translated document in the world. The UDHR serves as the foundational document for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD), adopted on December 13, 2006. The CRPD contains no new rights, but helps to explain how modern nations have agreed to interpret the rights of persons with disabilities. Joint Position Statement of AAIDD and The Arc on Human Rights All people with IDD are entitled to human and civil rights. Given that all people with IDD are complex human beings with varying attributes and living circumstances, and many experience multiple risk factors for human and civil rights violations, we emphasize that all are entitled to human and civil rights regardless of age, gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, cultural, linguistic, geographic, and spiritual diversity, economic status, severity of disability, intensity of needed supports, or other factors that expose them to increased risk of rights v iolations. These rights include the rights to autonomy, dignity, family, justice, life, liberty, equality, self - determination, community participation, property, health, well -being, access to voting, and equality of opportunity and others recognized by law or international declarations, conventions, or standards. All people with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities must have the right to supports they need to exercise and ensure their human and civil rights. Local, state, federal, and internationa l governments must strongly enforce all human and civil rights. From Longing to Belonging Everyone wants to belong \u2014in their community at large and especially their faith -based community. Nearly 20 percent of people live with a disability or mental health condition, which means so many families \u2014maybe even yours \u2014are dealing with these concerns for their loved ones \u2014or for themselves. The one place everyone should feel like they belong is their house of worship and other faith -based community org anizations. From Longing to Belonging \u2014A Practical Guide to Including People with Disabilities and Mental Health Conditions in Your Faith Community is a book based on Shelly Christensen's experiences as a leader in the growing field of faith -based inclusion of people with disabilities and mental health conditions, and her work with congregations and other faith -based organizations. It's practical, inspirationa l, and above all else, helps faith -based organizations embrace authentic belonging and inclusion for all people.

That's the reason behind one mom's viral post about dolls with disabilities. Her daughter, Ivy, has Down syndrome and now has a doll that looks just like her. Lindsay Filcik told \"Good Morning America\" she believes it is important for children with disabilities to see themselves repr esented in the toys they play with. Her post has nearly 18,000 likes so far. She wrote in part, \"Every single human being deserves to see somebody who looks like them in movies, books, commercials, and toys. Unfortunately for far too long that has not been the case. People of all races, abilities, body types, genders, religions, etc. need to be represented in what we watch, read, and play with. Recently we are seeing steps to remedy this problem in the media and I appreciate that! Representation matters!\" She continued: \"Imagine being a child with a disability and all you ever see are typical, able bodied children. What message does that send you about yourself? That you are 'abnormal'. That you are not worthy of being shown to the world. I know you're read ing this cringing inside, because of course no child should ever be made to feel that way. Lack of representation also hurts those children who are represented. They grow up with the incredibly skewed perception that everybody looks like them. And anybody who doesn't isn't 'normal' and should be feared. That my friends is how racism and ableism can be perpetuated in our kids without us even realizing it. Representation matters!\" The Grand Rapids, Michigan, mom's post includes two other girls playing with d olls who have disabilities similar to their own. She wrote, \"Look at these beautiful girls. Each one is represented by a doll that looks like them. Ivy has Down syndrome. Her doll looks just like her with almond shaped eyes and a button nose! Our friend Eliza has Spina Bifida. Her doll has forearm crutches (or sticks as Eliza says) & AFOs just like her! Our friend Stella has Spinal Muscular Atrophy. Her doll has a wheelchair just like her! Representation matters! \" Filick told \"GMA\" the post has been well received by parents of both disabled and non-disabled kids. \"Several parents of children who don't have disabilities told me they are adding a doll with a disability to their kids' Christmas lists,\" she said. \"They had just never thought of it before.\" 10 DD 12/11/2020 If you are experiencing a mental health crisis, BH Link is here for you BH Link's mission is to ensure all Rhode Islanders experiencing mental health and substance use crises receive the appropriate services they need as quickly as possible in an environment that supports their recovery.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Contact: Morna Murray December 3, 2020 860-538-1007 Federal Disabilities Partners Demand Access to Health Care for People with Disabilities Providence, Rhode Island -- Today, Disability Rights Rhode Island (DRRI), the independent, federally mandated Protection and Advocacy (P&A) System for the state of Rhode Island, asked Governor Gina Raimondo to issue an Executive Order directing enforcement of the Rhode Island Department of Health policy permitting people with disabilities to have the accompaniment of essential support persons while in the hospital. The request comes after months of unsuccessful negotiations with state personnel to enforce the policy, and amidst numerous complaints from individuals and families who have been denied appropriate access to care. DRRI is joined in this request by the Paul V. Sherlock Center on Disabilities at Rhode Island College, Rhode Island's University Center for Excellence on Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD), and the Rhode Island Developmental Disabilities Council. \"Many individuals with disabilities require essential support persons to assist in facilitating access, including communication with healthcare providers and providing informed consent for medical decisions,\" said Morna Murray, Executive Director of DRRI. \"We are deeply concerned people are being denied the essential support they need, effectively denying them access to critical health care. This can literally be the difference between life and death.\" \"Our families need this policy to be enforced immediately and consistently,\" said Amy Grattan, Executive Director of the Paul V. Sherlock Center on Disabilities. \"We have received dozens of calls from families who report their loved ones have been traumatized because the policy has not been enforced, and as a result are now afraid to seek necessary care for fear of further distress and harm.\" \"It is imperative that all people have the ability to access medical treatment that is appropriate, proper, and with the person's informed consent,\" said Kevin Nerney, Executive Director for the Rhode Island Developmental Disabilities Council. \"Denying an individual the ability to understand or communicate their needs is clear discrimination and a denial of civil rights.\" The three federal partners have asked for a meeting with Governor Raimondo to resolve this issue as quickly as possible. In addition to ensuring that people with disabilities have access to health care, they seek to address the chilling effect the non-enforcement of the Department of Health policy is having upon families who are reluctant to subject their family members to additional trauma while hospitalized. ### Support Small Business es Small businesses are the foundation for RI's economy. People with disabilities also own businesses throughout Rhode Island. A number of people with disabilities have participated in a Business Development Series administered by the RI Developmental Disabilities Council (RIDDC).

Following are six profiles of local small bu sinesses that have benefitt ed from the Self - Employment Bus iness Incubator. Help support these individuals by checking out their Websites or Facebook pages and purchasing some of their products and unique items for the upcoming holiday season!

My process is carefully detailed and planned out so each card is created with imagery that shares my optimisti c outlook on life. They are sold individually for $3.oo each or 2 for $5.oo. You can also purchase a package of 6 for $12. I participated in the RIDDC's self -employment project to help me learn skills to improve and market my business. Please enjoy my car "}
