226xivForeword Interest in micronutrient malnutrition has increased greatly over the last few years. One of the main reasons for the increased interest is the realization that micronutrient malnutrition contributes substantially to the global burden ofdisease. In 2000, the World Health Report 1identied iodine, iron, vitamin A and zinc deciencies as being among the world's most serious health risk factors. Inaddition to the more obvious clinical manifestations, micronutrient malnutritionis responsible for a wide range of non-specic physiological impairments,leading to reduced resistance to infections, metabolic disorders, and delayed or impaired physical and psychomotor development. The public health implica- tions of micronutrient malnutrition are potentially huge, and are especially sig-nicant when it comes to designing strategies for the prevention and control ofdiseases such as HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, and diet-related chronicdiseases. Another reason for the increased attention to the problem of micronutrient malnutrition is that, contrary to previous thinking, it is not uniquely the concernof poor countries. While micronutrient deciencies are certainly more frequentand severe among disadvantaged populations, they do represent a public healthproblem in some industrialized countries.This is particularly true of iodine de-ciency in Europe, where it was generally assumed to have been eradicated, andof iron deciency, which is currently the most prevalent micronutrient deciencyin the world. In addition, the increased consumption in industrialized countries(and increasingly in those in social and economic transition) of highly-processedenergy-dense but micronutrient-poor foods, is likely to adversely affect micronu-trient intake and status. Measures to correct micronutrient deciencies - at least the major ones - are, however, well known, and moreover relatively cheap and easy to implement.The control of iodine deciency disorders through salt iodization, for example,has been a major accomplishment in public health nutrition over the last 30 years. 1World health report, 2000 .Geneva, World Heath Organization, 2000.FOREWORD xvThe best way of preventing micronutrient malnutrition is to ensure con- sumption of a balanced diet that is adequate in every nutrient. Unfortunately,this is far from being achievable everywhere since it requires universal access to adequate food and appropriate dietary habits. From this standpoint, food forti-cation has the dual advantage of being able to deliver nutrients to large seg-ments of the population without requiring radical changes in food consumptionpatterns. In fact, fortication has been used for more than 80 years in industri-alized countries as a means of restoring micronutrients lost by food processing,in particular, some of the B vitamins, and has been a major contributory factor in the eradication of diseases associated with deciencies in these vitamins.Because of the increased awareness of the widespread prevalence and harmfuleffects of micronutrient malnutrition, and in consideration of changes in food systems (notably an increased reliance on centrally processed foods), and successful fortication experiences in other regions, increasing numbers ofdeveloping countries are now committed to, or are considering, fortication programmes. With so much accumulated experience, the conditions under which food for- tication can be recommended as a strategic option for controlling micronutri-ent malnutrition are now better understood. Its limitations are also well known:food fortication alone cannot correct micronutrient deciencies when largenumbers of the targeted population, either because of poverty or locality, havelittle or no access to the fortied food, when the level of micronutrient deciencyis too severe, or when the concurrent presence of infections increases the meta-bolic demand for micronutrients. Various safety, technological and cost consid-erations can also place constraints on food fortication interventions. Thus,proper food fortication programme planning not only requires assessment ofits potential impact on the nutritional status of the population but also of its fea-sibility in a given context. The success of a fortication programme can be measured through its public health impact and its sustainability. The latter implies an intersectoral approachwhere, in addition to competent national public health authorities, research,trade, law, education, nongovernmental organizations and the commercial sectorare all involved in the planning and implementation of the programme. It hastaken time to appreciate the role of the private sector, in particular industry, andthe importance of civil society in this process.These are now fully acknowledgedand this recognition should strengthen the capability of interventions to combatmicronutrient malnutrition. The main purpose of these Guidelines is to assist countries in the design and implementation of appropriate food fortication programmes. Drawing onseveral recent high quality publications on the subject and on programme expe-rience, information on food fortication has been critically analysed and thenGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS xvitranslated into scientically sound guidelines for application in the eld. More specically, the Guidelines provide information relating to the benets, limita-tions, design, implementation, monitoring, evaluation, cost-benet and regula- tion of food fortication, particularly in developing countries.They are intendedto be a resource for governments and agencies that are currently implementing,or considering food fortication, and a source of information for scientists, tech-nologists and the food industry. The Guidelines are written from a nutrition andpublic health perspective, to provide practical guidance on how food fortica-tion should be implemented, monitored and evaluated within the general context of the need to control micronutrient deciencies in a population. They are pri-marily intended for nutrition-related public health programme managers, butshould also be useful to all those working to control micronutrient malnutrition, including industry. The document is organized into four complementary sections. Part I introduces the concept of food fortication as a potential strategy for the controlof micronutrient malnutrition. Part II summarizes the prevalence, causes and consequences of micronutrient deciencies, and the public health benetsof micronutrient malnutrition control. It lays the groundwork for public health personnel to assess the magnitude of the problem, and the potential benets of fortication, in their particular situation. Part III provides technicalinformation on the various chemical forms of micronutrients that can be used to fortify foods, and reviews experience of their use in specic food vehicles. Part IV describes the key steps involved in designing, imple- menting and sustaining fortication programmes, starting with the deter-mination of the amount of nutrients to be added to foods, followed by the implementation of monitoring and evaluating systems, including qualitycontrol/quality assurance procedures, before moving on to the estimation of cost-effectiveness and cost-benet ratios. The importance of, and strategies for, regulation and international harmonization, communication,advocacy, consumer marketing and public education are also explained in some detail. The production of the Guidelines has been the result of a long process that started in 2002. Under the aegis of the World Health Organization (WHO), anexpert group was established and charged with the task of developing a set ofguidelines on food fortication practice. A draft version of the guidelines wasreviewed in 2003 by a multidisciplinary panel of experts who collectively rep-resented the range of knowledge and experience required for developing suchguidelines. The panel members included experts in public health, nutrition sci-ences and food technology, from both the public and the private sectors. After-wards, the draft of the guidelines was circulated among eld nutritionists and public health practitioners and also tested in a number of countries. All of thecomments received through this process were considered for this nalized version of the guidelines. Weare all committed to the elimination of micronutrient malnutrition. We hope that these Guidelines will help countries to meet this goal and thereforeenable their population to achieve its full social and economic potential. Lindsay Allen Bruno de BenoistOmar DaryRichard HurrellFOREWORD xviixviiiPreface More than 2 billion people in the world today suffer from micronutrient de- ciencies caused largely by a dietary deciency of vitamins and minerals. Thepublic health importance of these deciencies lies upon their magnitude andtheir health consequences, especially in pregnant women and young children,as they affect fetal and child growth, cognitive development and resistance to infection. Although people in all population groups in all regions of the world may be affected, the most widespread and severe problems are usually found amongst resource poor, food insecure and vulnerable households in developing countries. Poverty, lack of access to a variety of foods, lack of knowledge of appropriate dietary practices and high incidence of infectious diseases are key factors. Micronutrient malnutrition is thus a major impedimentto socio-economic development contributing to a vicious circle of under-development and to the detriment of already underprivileged groups. It has long-ranging effects on health, learning ability and productivity and has highsocial and public costs leading to reduced work capacity due to high rates ofillness and disability. Overcoming micronutrient malnutrition is therefore a precondition for ensur- ing rapid and appropriate national development.This was the consensus reachedatthe FAO/WHO International Conference on Nutrition (ICN) in December 1992, where 159 countries endorsed the World Declaration on Nutrition, pledg-ing \"to make all efforts to eliminat e... iodine and vitamin A deciencies\" and \"to reduce substantiall y... other important micronutrient deciencies, includ- ing iron.\" Since then, FAO and WHO have continued to work to achieve thisgoal and in doing so have adopted four main strategies improving dietary intakesthrough increased production, preservation and marketing of micronutrient-richfoods combined with nutrition education; food fortication; supplementation;and global public health and other disease control measures. Each of these strate-gies have a place in eliminating micronutrient malnutrition. For maximum impact, the right balance or mix of these mutually reinforcing strategies need tobe put in place to ensure access to consumption and utilization of an adequatevariety and quantity of safe, good-quality foods for all people of the world. Underpinning these strategies is the realisation that when there is a dietary de-ciency in any one nutrient, there are likely to be other nutrient deciencies aswell. Consequently in the long-term, measures for the prevention and control of micronutrient deciencies should be based on diet diversication and consumereducation about how to choose foods that provide a balanced diet, including the necessary vitamins and minerals. These guidelines are meant to assist countries in the design and implemen- tation of appropriate food fortication programmes as part of a comprehensivefood-based strategy for combating micronutrient deciencies. Fortication offood can make an important contribution to the reduction of micronutrient malnutrition when and where existing food supplies and limited access fail toprovide adequate levels of certain nutrients in the diet. T o ensure that the targetpopulation will benet from a food fortication programme, an appropriate foodvehicle must be selected that is widely consumed throughout the year by a large portion of the population at risk of a particular deciency. In order to reach dif-ferent segments of the population who may have different dietary habits, select-ing more than one food vehicle may be necessary. Fortication of a staple foodaffects everyone, including the poor, pregnant women, young children and pop-ulations that can never be completely covered by social services. In addition,fortication reaches secondary at-risk groups, such as the elderly and those who have an unbalanced diet. Food fortication is usually socially acceptable,requires no change in food habits, does not alter the characteristics of the food,can be introduced quickly, can produce nutritional benets for the target pop-ulation quickly, is safe, and can be a cost-effective way of reaching large targetpopulations that are at risk of micronutrient deciency. However, there are limitations on the benets of fortication and difculties in its implementation and effectiveness. There may, for example, be concernsraised about the possibility of overdose or a reluctance to fortify on human rightsgrounds where consumer choice may be an issue. There may be reluctance on the part of the food industry to fortify out of fear of insufcient market demandfor fortied foods or concern about consumer perceptions that the food producthas been altered. Food fortication also raises production costs through suchexpenses as initial equipment purchases, equipment maintenance, increased pro-duction staff needs and quality control and assurance facilities. Economicallymarginalised households may not have access to such foods and other vulnera-ble population groups, particularly children under ve years of age, may not beable to consume large enough quantities of the fortied food to satisfy an ade-quate level of their daily requirements. All these issues need to be carefullyassessed and these are discussed in detail. This publication is a useful guide to assist decision makers in ensuring that the nutritionally vulnerable and at-risk populations benet from food fortica-tion programmes and FAO and WHO would like to express our thanks to allwho have been involved in this process. We reafrm our support to achieve theMillennium Development Goals set by governments for overall nutritionPREFACE xiximprovement and will collaborate with international and national agencies so as to accelerate the planning and implementation of comprehensive and sustain-able food fortication programmes as one element of national nutrition improve- ment policies, plans and programmes.

Cost limit refers to the maximum acceptable increment in price of a food due to fortication. ADietary Recommended Intake (DRI) is a quantitative estimate of a nutri- ent intake that is used as a reference value for planning and assessing dietsfor apparently healthy people. Examples include AIs, EARs, RDAs and ULs. Effectiveness refers to the impact of an intervention in practice. Compared to efcacy, the effectiveness of a fortication programme will be limited byfactors such as non- or low consumption of the fortied food. Efcacy refers to the capacity of an intervention such as fortication to achieve the desired impact under ideal circumstances. This usually refers to experi-mental, well-supervised intervention trials. Enrichment is synonymous with fortication and refers to the addition of micronutrients to a food irrespective of whether the nutrients were originallyin the food before processing or not. Essential micronutrient refers to any micronutrient, which is needed for growth and development and the maintenance of healthy life, that is normally consumed as a constituent of food and cannot be synthesized in adequateamounts by the body. The Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) is the average (median) daily nutrient intake level estimated to meet the needs of half the healthy individ-uals in a particular age and gender group. The EAR is used to derive the Recommended Dietary Allowance. Evaluation refers to the assessment of the effectiveness and impact of the pro- gramme on the targeted population. The aim of an evaluation is to provide evidence that the programme is achieving its nutritional goals. Feasible Fortication Level (FFL) is that which is determined, subject to costGLOSSARY xxviiand technological constraints, as the level that will provide the greatest number of at-risk individual with an adequate intake without causing an unac-ceptable risk of excess intakes in the whole population. Food commodities are staple foods, condiments and milk. Fortication is the practice of deliberately increasing the content of an essen- tial micronutrient, i.e. vitamins and minerals (including trace elements) in afood, so as to improve the nutritional quality of the food supply and providea public health benet with minimal risk to health. Legal Minimum level (LmL) is the minimum amount of micronutrient that a fortied food must contain according to national regulations and standards.This value is estimated by adding the intrinsic content of a micronutrient inthe food to the selected level of fortication. Market-driven fortication refers to the situation where the food manufac- turer takes the initiative to add one or more micronutrients to processed foods,usually within regulatory limits, in order to increase sales and protability. Mass fortication refers to the addition of micronutrients to foods commonly consumed by the general public, such as cereals, condiments and milk. Maximum Tolerable Level (MTL) is the maximum micronutrient content that a fortied food can present as it is established in food law, in order to mini-mize the risk of excess intake. It should coincide or be lower than the safetylimit. Minimum Fortication Level (mFL) is the level calculated by reducing the Feasible Fortication Level by three standards deviations (or coefcients of variation) of the fortication process, in order that the average coincides or is lower than the calculated Feasible Fortication Level. Monitoring refers to the continuous collection and review of information on programme implementation activities for the purposes of identifying prob-lems (such as non-compliance) and taking corrective actions so that the pro- gramme fulls its stated objectives. Nutritional equivalence is achieved when an essential nutrient is added to a product that is designed to resemble a common food in appearance, texture,flavour and odour in amounts such that the substitute product has a similarnutritive value, in terms of the amount and bioavailability of the added essen-tial nutrient. Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs) are dietary reference values dened by the Codex Alimentarius Commission with the aim of harmonizing the labellingof processed foods. It is a value applicable to all members of the family agedGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS xxviii3 years and over. These values are constantly reviewed based on advances in scientic knowledge. Nutrient requirement refers to the lowest continuing intake level of a nutrient that will maintain a dened level of nutriture in an individual for a given cri-terion of nutritional adequacy. Processed foods are those in which food raw materials have been treated indus- trially so as to preserve them. Some may be formulated by mixing several dif-ferent ingredients. Apremix is a mixture of a micronutrient(s) and another ingredient, often the same food that is to be fortied, that is added to the food vehicle toimprove the distribution of the micronutrient mix within the food matrix andto reduce the separation (segregation) between the food and micronutrientparticles . Quality assurance (QA) refers to the implementation of planned and system- atic activities necessary to ensure that products or services meet quality stan- dards. The performance of quality assurance can be expressed numericallyas the results of quality control exercises. Quality control (QC) refers to the techniques and assessments used to docu- ment compliance of the product with established technical standards, throughthe use of objective and measurable indicators . Relative bioavailability is used to rank the absorbability of a nutrient by com- paring its absorbability with that of a reference nutrient that is considered ashaving the most efcient absorbability. Restoration is the addition of essential nutrients to foods to restore amounts originally present in the natural product, but unavoidably lost during pro-cessing (such as milling), storage or handling. Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) are dened by the United States Food and Nutrition Board and are conceptually the same as the Recom- mended Nutrient Intake (RNI), but may have a slightly different values forsome micronutrients. The Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) is the daily intake that meets the nutrient requirements of almost all apparently healthy individuals in an age-and sex-specic population group. It is set at the Estimated Average Require-ment plus 2 standard deviations. Safety limit is the greatest amount of a micronutrient that can be safely added to specic foods. It considers the UL for the nutrient and the 95 thpercentile of consumption of a food, and makes allowances for the fact that the nutrient is also consumed in unfortied foods, and may be lost during storage and distribution, and/or cooking. Targeted fortication refers to the fortication of foods designed for specic population subgroups, such as complementary weaning foods for infants. The technological limit is the maximum level of micronutrient addition that does not change the organoleptic or physical properties of the food. TheTolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) is to the highest average daily nutri- ent intake level unlikely to pose risk of adverse health effects to almost all(97.5%) apparently healthy individuals in an age- and sex-specic populationgroup. Universal fortication is equivalent to mass fortication. Universal salt iodization (USI) refers to the addition of iodine to all salt for both human and animal consumption. Usual intake refers to an individual's average intake over a relatively long period of time.GLOSSARY xxixPARTI The role of food fortication in the control of micronutrient malnutritionCHAPTER 1 Micronutrient malnutrition: a public health problem 1.1 Global prevalence of micronutrient malnutrition Micronutrient malnutrition (MNM) is widespread in the industrialized nations, but even more so in the developing regions of the world. It can affect all age groups, but young children and women of reproductive age tend to be among those most at risk of developing micronutrient deciencies. Micronutrient mal-nutrition has many adverse effects on human health, not all of which are clini-cally evident. Even moderate levels of deciency (which can be detected bybiochemical or clinical measurements) can have serious detrimental effects onhuman function. Thus, in addition to the obvious and direct health effects, theexistence of MNM has profound implications for economic development andproductivity, particularly in terms of the potentially huge public health costs andthe loss of human capital formation. Worldwide, the three most common forms of MNM are iron, vitamin A and iodine deciency. T ogether, these affect at least one third of the world's popula-tion, the majority of whom are in developing countries. Of the three, iron de- ciency is the most prevalent. It is estimated that just over 2 billion people are anaemic, just under 2 billion have inadequate iodine nutrition and 254 millionpreschool-aged children are vitamin A decient ( Table 1.1 ). From a public health viewpoint, MNM is a concern not just because such large numbers of people are affected, but also because MNM, being a risk factorfor many diseases, can contribute to high rates of morbidity and even mortality.It has been estimated that micronutrient deciencies account for about 7.3% ofthe global burden of disease, with iron and vitamin A deciency ranking amongthe 15 leading causes of the global disease burden ( 4). According to WHO mortality data, around 0.8 million deaths (1.5% of the total) can be attributed to iron deciency each year, and a similar number to vitamin A deciency. In terms of the loss of healthy life, expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), iron-deciency anaemia results in 25 million DALYs lost (or 2.4% of the global total), vitamin A deciency in 18 million DALYs lost (or 1.8% of the global total) and iodine deciency in 2.5 million DALYs lost (or 0.2% of the global total) ( 4). The scale and impact of deciencies in other micronutrients is much more difcult to quantify, although it is likely that some forms of MNM, including 3zinc, folate and vitamin D deciency, make a substantial contribution to the global burden of disease. However, there are few data on the prevalence of de-ciencies in these micronutrients, and as their adverse effects on health are some-times non-specic, the public health implications are less well understood. In the poorer regions of the world, MNM is certain to exist wherever there is undernutrition due to food shortages and is likely to be common where dietslack diversity. Generally speaking, whereas wealthier population groups are ableto augment dietary staples with micronutrient-rich foods (such as meat, sh,poultry, eggs, milk and dairy products) and have greater access to a variety offruits and vegetables, poorer people tend to consume only small amounts of suchfoods, relying instead on more monotonous diets based on cereals, roots andtubers. The micronutrient content of cereals (especially after milling), roots andtubers is low, so these foods typically provide only a small proportion of the dailyrequirements for most vitamins and minerals. Fat intake among such groups isalso often very low and given the role of fat in facilitating the absorption of arange of micronutrients across the gut wall, the low level of dietary fat puts such populations at further risk of MNM. Consequently, populations that consume few animal source foods may suffer from a high prevalence of several micro-nutrient deciencies simultaneously. In the wealthier countries, higher incomes, greater access to a wider variety of micronutrient-rich and fortied foods, and better health services, are allfactors that contribute to the lowering of the risk and prevalence of MNM.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 4TABLE 1.1 Prevalence of the three major micronutrient deciencies by WHO region WHO AnaemiaaInsufcient Vitamin A region (total population) iodine intakebdeciencyc (total (preschool children) population) No. % of No. % of No. % of (millions) total (millions) total (millions) total Africa 244 46 260 43 53 49 Americas 141 19 75 10 16 20South-East Asia 779 57 624 40 127 69Europe 84 10 436 57 No data availableEastern 184 45 229 54 16 22 Mediterranean Western Pacic 598 38 365 24 42 27 Total 2030 37 1989 35 254 42 aBased on the proportion of the population with haemoglobin concentrations below estab- lished cut-off levels. bBased on the proportion of the population with urinary iodine <100\u00b5g/l. cBased on the proportion of the population with clinical eye signs and/or serum retinol 0.70 \u00b5mol/l. Sources: references ( 1-3).However, consumption of a diet that contains a high proportion of energy-dense but micronutrient-poor processed foods can put some population groups at risk of MNM. Although at present this practice is more common in industrializedcountries, it is rapidly becoming more prevalent among countries undergoingsocial and economic transition. Table 1.2 provides an overview of the prevalence, risk factors, and health con- sequences of deciencies in each of the 15 micronutrients covered in theseeguidelines. For reasons stated above, prevalence estimates are only provided foriron vitamin A and iodine deciencies. Further information is available from the WHO Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Information System 1. Up until the 1980s, efforts to alleviate undernutrition in developing countries were focused on protein-energy malnutrition (PEM). While PEM certainly remains an important concern, we have since come to appreciate the signi-cance of micronutrient malnutrition in terms of its effect on human health andfunction. As a result, the past two decades have seen an increase in activities thatseek to understand and control specic micronutrient deciencies ( 7). Efforts to control iodine deciency in developing countries, for example, were givennew impetus in the early 1980s when it was recognized that iodine deciencywas the most common cause of preventable brain damage and mental retarda- tion in childhood ( 8,9). There were also reports of increased risks of stillbirths and low-birth-weight infants in iodine decient areas ( 10,11 ). Importantly, the technology to prevent iodine deciency - salt iodization - already existed and,moreover, was easy to implement and affordable even by governments withlimited health budgets. It therefore seemed likely that salt iodization could be afeasible option for preventing iodine deciency on a global scale. Similarly, having established that vitamin A status is an important determi- nant of child survival - in addition to preventing and treating eye disorders, sup-plementation of vitamin A-decient children lowers their risk of morbidity(particularly that related to severe diarrhoea), and reduces mortality frommeasles and all-cause mortality ( 12,13 ) - measures to control vitamin A de- ciency have been initiated in several world regions. Reports that iron supple-mentation of iron-decient individuals can improve cognitive function, schoolperformance and work capacity ( 14,15 ), and that severe anaemia increases the risk of maternal and child mortality ( 16), have provided a strong rationale for iron interventions. Intervention trials have also revealed that zinc supplementa-tion improves the growth of stunted, zinc-decient children ( 17), lowers rates of diarrhoea and pneumonia (the two leading causes of child death), and short-ens the duration of diarrhoeal episodes ( 18,19 ). In the wake of such accumulated evidence, the international community has increasingly come to recognize the public health importance of MNM. In 1990,1.

Sources: adapted from references (1-3,5,6 ).the World Health Assembly passed a landmark resolution urging action by Member States \"to prevent and control iodine deciency disorders\" ( 20). Later that year, at the World Summit for Children, the world's leaders endorsed the\"virtual elimination of iodine and vitamin A deciency and a reduction of theprevalence of iron-deciency anaemia in women by one third\".These goals havebeen reiterated at a number of subsequent international fora, including the Montreal conference on Ending Hidden Hunger in 1991, the 1992 FAO/WHOInternational Conference on Nutrition held in Rome, the 1993 World HealthAssembly held in Geneva, and the Special Session on Children of the UnitedNations General Assembly, which was held in New Y ork in 2002.There has beenremarkable degree of consensus and support for MNM control between gov-ernments, United Nations agencies, multilateral and bilateral agencies, academicand research institutions, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and donorfoundations. More recently, following recognition of the essential role played byindustry - in particular, the salt, food and drug industries - stronger links withthe private sector have been forged. This is reflected by the implementation ofseveral public-private coalitions aimed at addressing the main micronutrientdeciencies, which include the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition 1and The Global Network for Sustained Elimination of Iodine Deciency2. 1.2 Strategies for the control of micronutrient malnutrition The control of vitamin and mineral deciencies is an essential part of the overalleffort to ght hunger and malnutrition. Countries need to adopt and support acomprehensive approach that addresses the causes of malnutrition and the oftenassociated \"hidden hunger\" which rest intinsic to in poverty and unsustainablelivelihoods. Actions that promote an increase in the supply, access, consump-tion and utilization of an adequate quantity, quality and variety of foods for allpopulations groups should be supported. The aim is for all people to be able toobtain from their diet all the energy, macro- and micronutrients they need toenjoy a healthy and productive life. Policy and programme responses include food-based strategies such as dietary diversication and food fortication, as well as nutrition education,public health and food safety measures, and nally supplementation. Theseapproaches should be regarded as complementary, with their relative importancedepending on local conditions and the specic mix of local needs . Of the three options that are aimed at increasing the intake of micronutrients, programmes that deliver micronutrient supplements often provide the fastestimprovement in the micronutrient status of individuals http://www.gainhealth.org 11groups. Food fortication tends to have a less immediate but nevertheless a much wider and more sustained impact. Although increasing dietary diversityis generally regarded as the most desirable and sustainable option, it takes the longest to implement. 1.2.1 Increasing the diversity of foods consumed Increasing dietary diversity means increasing both the quantity and the range of micronutrient-rich foods consumed. In practice, this requires the implementa-tion of programmes that improve the availability and consumption of, and accessto, different types of micronutrient-rich foods (such as animal products, fruitsand vegetables) in adequate quantities, especially among those who at risk for,or vulnerable to, MNM. In poorer communities, attention also needs to be paidto ensuring that dietary intakes of oils and fats are adequate for enhancing theabsorption of the limited supplies of micronutrients. Increasing dietary diversity is the preferred way of improving the nutrition of a population because it has the potential to improve the intake of many food constituents - not just micronutrients - simultaneously. Ongoing research sug-gests that micronutrient-rich foods also provide a range of antioxidants and probiotic substances that are important for protection against selected non-communicable diseases and for enhancing immune function. However, as astrategy for combating MNM, increasing dietary diversity is not without its lim-itations, the main one being the need for behaviour change and for educationabout how certain foods provide essential micronutrients and other nutritivesubstances. A lack of resources for producing and purchasing higher qualityfoods can sometimes present a barrier to achieving greater dietary diversity,especially in the case of poorer populations. The importance of animal sourcefoods for dietary quality is increasingly being recognized, and innovativeapproaches to increase their production and consumption in poorer regions ofthe world are currently being explored ( 21). Efforts are also underway to help poorer communities identify, domesticate and cultivate traditional and wildmicronutrient-rich foods as a simple and affordable means of satisfyingmicronutrient needs ( 22-24 ). For infants, ensuring a diet of breast milk is an effective way of preventing micronutrient deciencies. In much of the developing world, breast milk is themain source of micronutrients during the rst year of life (with the exceptionof iron). Exclusive breastfeeding for the rst 6 months of life and continuationinto the second year should thus be promoted. Moreover, all lactating womenshould be encouraged to consume a healthful and varied diet so that adequatelevels of micronutrients are secreted in their milk. After the age of 6 months, itis important that the complementary foods provided to breast-fed infants are asdiverse and as rich in micronutrients as possible.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 121.2.2 Food fortication Food fortication refers to the addition of micronutrients to processed foods. In many situations, this strategy can lead to relatively rapid improvements in the micronutrient status of a population, and at a very reasonable cost,especially if advantage can be taken of existing technology and local distri-bution networks. Since the benets are potentially large, food fortication can be a very cost-effective public health intervention. However, an obviousrequirement is that the fortied food(s) needs to be consumed in adequateamounts by a large proportion of the target individuals in a population. It is also necessary to have access to, and to use, forticants that are well absorbedyet do not affect the sensory properties of foods. In most cases, it is preferable to use food vehicles that are centrally processed, and to have the support of thefood industry. Fortication of food with micronutrients is a valid technology for reducing micronutrient malnutrition as part of a food-based approach when and whereexisting food supplies and limited access fail to provide adequate levels of therespective nutrients in the diet. In such cases, food fortication reinforces andsupports ongoing nutrition improvement programmes and should be regardedas part of a broader, integrated approach to prevent MNM, thereby comple-menting other approaches to improve micronutrient status. 1.2.3 Supplementation Supplementation is the term used to describe the provision of relatively large doses of micronutrients, usually in the form of pills, capsules or syrups. It hasthe advantage of being capable of supplying an optimal amount of a specicnutrient or nutrients, in a highly absorbable form, and is often the fastest wayto control deciency in individuals or population groups that have been identi-ed as being decient. In developing countries, supplementation programmes have been widely used to provide iron and folic acid to pregnant women, and vitamin A to infants, chil-dren under 5 years of age and postpartum women. Because a single high-dosevitamin A supplement improves vitamin A stores for about 4-6 months, sup-plementation two or three times a year is usually adequate. However, in the caseof the more water-soluble vitamins and minerals, supplements need to be con-sumed more frequently. Supplementation usually requires the procurement andpurchase of micronutrients in a relatively expensive pre-packaged form, aneffective distribution system and a high degree of consumer compliance (espe-cially if supplements need to be consumed on a long-term basis). A lack of sup-plies and poor compliance are consistently reported by many supplementationprogramme managers as being the main barriers to success.1. MICRONUTRIENT MALNUTRITION: A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM 131.2.4 Public health measures In addition to the specic interventions outlined above, public health measures of a more general nature are often required to help prevent and correct MNM,because MNM is often associated with poor overall nutritional status and witha high prevalence of infection. Such measures include infection control (e.g.immunization, malaria and parasite control), and improvement of water and san-itation. Other factors, such as the quality of child care and maternal education,also need to be taken into consideration when developing public health responsesto MNM. 1.3 Food fortication in practice Food fortication has a long history of use in industrialized countries for the successful control of deciencies of vitamins A and D, several B vitamins (thi-amine, riboflavin and niacin), iodine and iron. Salt iodization was introduced inthe early 1920s in both Switzerland ( 25) and the United States of America ( 26) and has since expanded progressively all over the world to the extent that iodizedsalt is now used in most countries. From the early 1940s onwards, the forti-cation of cereal products with thiamine, riboflavin and niacin became commonpractice. Margarine was fortied with vitamin A in Denmark and milk withvitamin D in the United States. Foods for young children were fortied withiron, a practice which has substantially reduced the risk of iron-deciencyanaemia in this age group. In more recent years, folic acid fortication of wheathas become widespread in the Americas, a strategy adopted by Canada and theUnited States and about 20 Latin American countries. In the less industrialized countries, fortication has become an increasingly attractive option in recent years, so much so that planned programmes have moved forward to the implementation phase more rapidly than previouslythought possible. Given the success of the relatively long-running programmeto fortify sugar with vitamin A in Central America, where the prevalence ofvitamin A deciency has been reduced considerably, similar initiatives are beingattempted in other world regions. Currently, the rst sugar fortication experi- ence in sub-Saharan Africa is taking place in Zambia, and if successful will beemulated elsewhere. Darnton-Hill and Nalubola ( 27) have identied at least 27 developing countries that could benet from programmes to fortify one or morefoods. Despite apparent past successes, to date, very few fortication programmes have formally evaluated their impact on nutritional status. However, without aspecic evaluation component, once a fortication programme has been initi-ated, it is difcult to know whether subsequent improvements in the nutritional status of a population are due to the intervention or to other changes, such as,improvements in socioeconomic status or in public health provision, thatGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 14occurred over the same period of time. Evidence that food fortication pro- grammes do indeed improve nutritional status has therefore tended to come from either efcacy trials and/or reports of programme effectiveness. Efcacytrials, i.e. trials conducted in controlled feeding situations, are relatively numer-ous and have usefully documented the impact of fortied foods on nutritionalstatus and other outcomes. Evidence of programme effectiveness, which isobtained by assessing changes in nutritional status and other outcomes once a programme has been implemented, is less widely available. Of the few effectiveness studies that have been conducted, even fewer included a non-intervention control group, an omission that weakens the evidence that can beobtained from studies of this type. 1.3.1 Efcacy trials As indicated above, efcacy trials evaluate the impact of a test intervention under ideal circumstances. In the case of food fortication, this typically involves alltest subjects consuming a known amount of the fortied food. In the majority of efcacy trials conducted to date, fortied foods have been shown to improve micronutrient status. Selected examples, involving a range of micronutrients, arebriefly described below. The general principles of programme impact evalua-tion, including the design of efcacy trials, are discussed in greater detail inChapter 8 of these guidelines. 1.3.1.1 Iron fortication In Viet Nam, 6-month efcacy trials have established that fortication of shsauce with iron can signicantly improve iron status and reduce anaemia andiron deciency ( 28). The subjects were non-pregnant anaemic female factory workers who consumed 10ml per day of a sauce that was fortied with 100mg iron (as NaFeEDTA) per 100ml. Figure 1.1 illustrates the effect of the inter- vention on iron deciency and iron-deciency anaemia; both were signicantly reduced after 6 months in the group receiving the fortied sauce relative to theplacebo control group. In China, a series of studies have been conducted to assess the efcacy, effec- tiveness and feasibility of fortifying soy sauce with iron (in the form ofNaFeEDTA). Daily consumption of 5mg or 20mg iron in the fortied saucewas reported to be very effective in the treatment of iron-deciency anaemia in children; positive effects were seen within 3 months of the start of the inter-vention (J. Chen, cited in ( 29). In a double-blind placebo-controlled effective- ness trial of the iron-fortied sauce, involving about 10000 children and women,a reduction in the prevalence of anaemia was observed within 6 months (seealso section 1.3.2.2).1. MICRONUTRIENT MALNUTRITION: A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM 15In an iron-decient Indian population in South Africa, fortication of curry powder with NaFeEDTA produced signicant improvements in blood haemo-globin, ferritin levels and iron stores in women, and in ferritin levels in men ( 30). During the 2-year study, the prevalence of iron-deciency anaemia in womenfell from 22% to just 5%. Regrettably, well-designed trials of the impact of iron fortication of flour are lacking at the present time. 1.3.1.2 Vitamin A fortication Trials conducted in the Philippines have revealed that fortication of monosodium glutamate with vitamin A produces positive effects on child mor-tality, and improved growth and haemoglobin levels in children ( 31). Later studies with preschool-aged children, who consumed 27g of vitamin A-fortiedmargarine per day for a period of 6 months, reported a reduction in the pre-valence of low serum retinol concentrations from 26% to 10% ( 32). Wheat flour fortied with vitamin A and fed as buns to Filipino schoolchildren for 30 weeks had the effect of halving the number that had low liver stores of the vitamin ( 33). 1.3.1.3 Multiple fortication A number of trials have evaluated the efcacy of specially-formulated foods and beverages as vehicles for multiple fortication. In South Africa, for example, for-GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 16FIGURE 1.1 Effect of iron fortication of sh sauce on iron status of non-pregnant anaemic female Vietnamese factory workers ***Prevalence (%)80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0Iron deficiency t0t3t6 Time Prevalence (%)80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0Iron deficiency anaemia t0t3t6 Time Prevalence of iron deciency and iron deciency anaemia at baseline, and after 3 and 6 months of intervention in the iron intervention group /H17039(10 mg iron/day in NaFeEDTA-fortied sh sauce (n =64)) and the control group /H17040(n=72) in anaemic Vietnamese women. Source: reproduced from reference ( 28), with the permission of the publishers.tication of biscuits with iron, -carotene and iodine improved the status of all of these nutrients in schoolchildren ( 34). Vitamin A and iron status deteriorated during the long school holidays when the biscuits were not fed. Fortication of a flavoured beverage with 10 micronutrients increased serum retinol andreduced iron deciency in T anzanian schoolchildren, and also improved their growth rates ( 35). Similarly, in Botswana, regular consumption of a 12- micronutrient enriched beverage by school-aged children increased their weightgain and mid-upper arm circumference, and improved their iron, folate,riboflavin and zinc status ( 36). 1.3.2 Effectiveness evaluations The aim of an effectiveness evaluation is to assess the impact of an intervention or programme in actual practice, as opposed to under controlled conditions.Because of factors such as the lack of consumption of the fortied food, themagnitude of the impact of an intervention is likely to be less than that in an efcacy trial (see also Chapter 8: Monitoring and evaluation). 1.3.2.1 Iodine fortication Numerous studies, particularly from the developed world, have clearly estab- lished that salt iodization is an effective means of controlling iodine deciency.In the United States, large-scale iodization of salt in Michigan reduced the goitrerate from about 40% to below 10% ( 26). In the early 20th century almost all Swiss schoolchildren had goitre and 0.5% of the population had cretinism.Whensalt iodization was introduced in 1922, the prevalence of goitre and deaf mutismin children dropped dramatically. Since then, a sustained salt iodization pro-gramme has ensured an adequate iodine status among the whole Swiss popula- tion ( 25). Despite such convincing evidence in support of salt iodization, in as recently as 2003, it was estimated that 54 countries still have inadequate iodinenutrition (i.e. median urinary iodine <100\u00b5g/l) ( 2). 1.3.2.2 Iron fortication The effectiveness of iron fortication has been demonstrated in several world regions. Iron fortication of infant formulas has been associated with a fall inthe prevalence of anaemia in children aged under 5 years in the United States(37,38 ). In Venezuela, wheat and maize flours have been fortied with iron (as a mixture of ferrous fumarate and elemental iron), vitamin A and various B vita-mins since 1993. A comparison of the prevalence of iron deciency and anaemiapre- and post-intervention showed a signicant reduction in the prevalence ofthese conditions in children ( 39). Fortication of milk with iron and vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in Chile produced a rapid reduction in the prevalence of iron1. MICRONUTRIENT MALNUTRITION: A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM 17deciency in infants and young children ( 40,41 ). The effectiveness of the forti- cation of soy sauce with iron is currently being evaluated in a population of 10000 Chinese women and children with a high risk of anaemia. Preliminary results of the 2-year double-blind placebo-controlled study have shown a reduc-tion in anaemia prevalence rates for all age groups after the rst 6 months (J.Chen, cited in ( 29). Unfortunately, very few other iron fortication programmes have been eval- uated. Information about the efcacy and effectiveness of flour fortication inparticular is urgently needed ( 42). 1.3.2.3 Combined iron and iodine fortication A randomized, double-blind effectiveness trial in Moroccan schoolchildren (n=367) has demonstrated that the dual fortication of salt with iron and iodine can improve both iron and iodine status ( 43). Results of the 40-week trial, in which salt was fortied with iron at a level of 1mg Fe/g salt (as ferrous sulfatemicroencapsulated with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil) are summarized inFigure 1.2 .In addition to improved iron status, by the end of the trial the iron- fortied group had signicantly lower thyroid volumes. Because iron is requiredfor thyroxine synthesis, iron deciency reduces the efcacy of iodine prophy-laxis. Thus, by supplying both iodine and iron, the impact of iodine forticationis maximized.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 18FIGURE 1.2 Effect of dual-fortied salt (iron and iodine) on the iron status of Moroccan schoolchildren Prevalence (%)40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Time (wk)02 04 0IDA, IS group ID without anaemia, IS group IDA, DFS group ID without anaemia, DFS group The probability of iron deciency anaemia (IDA) and iron deciency without anaemia (ID) was less in 6-15 year-old children receiving dual-fortied salt (DFS) containing both iron and iodine (n =183) than in those receiving iodized salt (IS) (n =184). For both IDA and ID without anaemia, the difference between the IS and DFS groups increased signicantly with time (P <0.01). Source: reproduced from reference ( 44).1.3.2.4 Vitamin A fortication Fortication of sugar with vitamin A is a strategy that has been used extensively throughout Central America. Starting in Guatemala in 1974, and extending toother countries in the region in subsequent years, the effect of this programmehas been to reduce the prevalence of low serum retinol values - from 27% in1965 to 9% in 1977 ( 45,46 ). There is also evidence to suggest that sugar forti- cation substantially increases the concentration of vitamin A in breast milk(47).When the programme was temporarily discontinued in parts of the region, the prevalence of low serum retinol again increased. Vitamin A fortication ofsugar is, however, still ongoing in Guatemala. 1.3.2.5 Folic acid fortication The introduction of the mandatory fortication of wheat flour with folic acid inthe United States in 1998 was accompanied by a signicant reduction in theprevalence of neural tube defects ( 48) and in plasma levels of homocysteine. (Elevated plasma homocysteine has been identied as a risk factor for cardio-vascular disease and other health problems ( 49). Even though these outcomes may have been due to other factors, there was certainly an increase in folateintakes ( 50) and an improvement in folate status ( 49) among the population in the period immediately following the implementation of the new legislation.Similar improvements in folate status have been seen after the commencementof folic acid fortication of wheat flour in Canada ( 51) (see Figure 1.3 ).1. MICRONUTRIENT MALNUTRITION: A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM 19FIGURE 1.3 Effect of flour fortication with folic acid on the folate status of elderly Canadian women Serum folate (nmol/l)30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Year1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 Serum folate concentrations in a cross-section of 15664 Canadian women aged 65 years and older in relation to the introduction of flour fortication in mid-1997. Data are presented as mean values (solid line) with 95% condence limits (dotted lines) Source: reproduced from reference ( 53), with the permission of the publishers.Likewise, in Chile, a national programme of flour fortication with folic acid increased serum folate and reduced group of deciency, pellagra and anaemia were relatively widespread public health problems during the 1930s in several countries, including theUnited States. In an attempt to reduce the prevalence of these conditions, a decision was taken to add thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and iron to wheat flour.With the implementation of fortication programmes for these micronutrientsduring the early 1940s in the United States and in some European countries,these deciencies largely disappeared ( 54). While it can be argued that other factors - such as improved dietary diversity - also played a role, enrichedflour continues to make an important contribution to meeting recommendednutrient intakes for the B-complex vitamins and iron in these and many othercountries today. 1.3.2.7 Vitamin D fortication The virtual elimination of childhood rickets in the industrialized countries hasbeen largely attributed to the addition of vitamin D to milk, a practice that com-menced in the 1930s in Canada and the United States. However, there are somesigns that rickets is re-emerging as a public health problem in these countries(55). In a recent study of African American women, a low intake of vitamin D fortied milk was found to be a signicant predictor of a high prevalence ofvitamin D deciency ( 56). Vitamin D fortication of milk also reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the elderly, especially in higher latitude regions where levelsof incident ultraviolet light are lower during the winter months ( 57,58 ). 1.4 Advantages and limitations of food fortication as a strategy to combat MNM Being a food-based approach, food fortication offers a number of advantages over other interventions aimed at preventing and controlling MNM. These include: If consumed on a regular and frequent basis, fortied foods will maintain body stores of nutrients more efciently and more effectively than will inter-mittent supplements. Fortied foods are also better at lowering the risk of themultiple deciencies that can result from seasonal decits in the food supplyor a poor quality diet. This is an important advantage to growing childrenwho need a sustained supply of micronutrients for growth and development,and to women of fertile age who need to enter periods of pregnancy and GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 20lactation with adequate nutrient stores. Fortication can be an excellent way of increasing the content of vitamins in breast milk and thus reducing theneed for supplementation in postpartum women and infants. Fortication generally aims to supply micronutrients in amounts that appro- ximate to those provided by a good, well-balanced diet. Consequently,fortied staple foods will contain \"natural\" or near natural levels of micronu-trients, which may not necessarily be the case with supplements. Fortication of widely distributed and widely consumed foods has the poten- tial to improve the nutritional status of a large proportion of the population,both poor and wealthy. Fortication requires neither changes in existing food patterns - which are notoriously difcult to achieve, especially in the short-term - nor individualcompliance. In most settings, the delivery system for fortied foods is already in place, generally through the private sector. The global tendency towards urbaniza-tion means that an ever increasing proportion of the population, includingthat in developing countries is consuming industry-processed, rather thanlocally-produced, foods. This affords many countries the opportunity todevelop effective strategies to combat MNM based on the fortication of centrally-processed dietary staples that once would have reached only a verysmall proportion of the population. Multiple micronutrient deciencies often coexist in a population that has a poor diet. It follows that multiple micronutrient fortication is frequentlydesirable. In most cases, it is feasible to fortify foods with several micro-nutrients simultaneously. It is usually possible to add one or several micronutrients without adding sub- stantially to the total cost of the food product at the point of manufacture. When properly regulated, fortication carries a minimal risk of chronic toxicity. Fortication is often more cost-effective than other strategies, especially if the technology already exists and if an appropriate food distribution system is inplace ( 59,60 ). Although it is generally recognized that food fortication can have an enormous positive impact on public health, there are, however, some limitations to thisstrategy for MNM control: While fortied foods contain increased amounts of selected micronutrients, they are not a substitute for a good quality diet that supplies adequate1. MICRONUTRIENT MALNUTRITION: A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM 21amounts of energy, protein, essential fats and other food constituents required for optimal health. A specic fortied foodstuff might not be consumed by all members of a target population. Conversely, everyone in the population is exposed toincreased levels of micronutrients in food, irrespective of whether or not theywill benet from fortication. Infants and young children, who consume relatively small amounts of food, are less likely to be able to obtain their recommended intakes of all micro-nutrients from universally fortied staples or condiments alone; fortied com-plementary foods may be appropriate for these age groups. It is also likelythat in many locations fortied foods will not supply adequate amounts of some micronutrients, such as iron for pregnant women, in which case supplements will still be needed to satisfy the requirements of selected population groups. Fortied foods often fail to reach the poorest segments of the general popu- lation who are at the greatest risk of micronutrient deciency. This is becausesuch groups often have restricted access to fortied foods due to low pur-chasing power and an underdeveloped distribution channel. Many under-nourished population groups often live on the margins of the marketeconomy, relying on own-grown or locally produced food. Availability, accessand consumption of adequate quantities and a variety of micronutrient-richfoods, such as animal foods and fruits and vegetables, is limited. Access tothe food distribution system is similarly restricted and these populationgroups will purchase only small amounts of processed foods. Rice produc- tion, in particular, tends to be domestic or local, as does maize production.In populations who rely on these staples, it may be difcult to nd an appro-priate food to fortify. Fortication of sugar, sauces, seasonings and othercondiments may provide a solution to this problem in some countries, if suchproducts are consumed in sufcient amounts by target groups. Verylow-income population groups are known to have coexisting multiple micronutrient deciencies, as a result of inadequate intakes of the traditionaldiet. Although multiple micronutrient fortication is technically possible, thereality is that the poor will be unable to obtain recommended intakes of allmicronutrients from fortied foods alone. Technological issues relating to food fortication have yet to be fully resolved, especially with regard to appropriate levels of nutrients, stability of forti-cants, nutrient interactions, physical properties, as well as acceptability byconsumers including cooking properties and taste (see Part III).GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 22The nature of the food vehicle, and/or the forticant, may limit the amount of forticant that can be successfully added. For example, some iron forti-cants change the colour and flavour of many foods to which they are added,and can cause the destruction of forticant vitamin A and iodine. Ways ofsolving some of these problems (e.g. microencapsulation of forticants withprotective coatings) have been developed, but some difculties remain (seePartIII). While it is generally possible to add a mixture of vitamins and minerals to rel- atively inert and dry foods, such as cereals, interactions can occur between forticant nutrients that adversely affect the organoleptic qualities of the foodor the stability of the nutrients. Knowledge is lacking about the quantitativeimpact of interactions among nutrients that are added as a mixture on theabsorption of the individual nutrients.This complicates the estimation of howmuch of each nutrient should be added. For example, the presence of largeamounts of calcium can inhibit the absorption of iron from a fortied food;the presence of vitamin C has the opposite effect and increases iron absorption. Although often more cost-effective than other strategies, there are neverthe- less signicant costs associated with the food fortication process, whichmight limit the implementation and effectiveness of food fortication pro-grammes. These typically include start-up costs, the expense of conducting trials for micronutrient levels, physical qualities and taste, a realistic analysisof the purchasing power of the expected beneciaries, the recurrent costsinvolved in creating and maintaining the demand for these products, as wellas the cost of an effective national surveillance system to ensure that forti-cation is both effective and safe (see Chapter 9). To ensure their success and sustainability, especially in resource-poor countries, food fortication programmes should be implemented in concert with povertyreduction programmes and other agricultural, health, education and social inter-vention programmes that promote the consumption and utilization of adequate quantities of good quality nutritious foods among the nutritionally vulnerable.Food fortication should thus be viewed as a complementary strategy for improving micronutrient status.1. MICRONUTRIENT MALNUTRITION: A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM 23CHAPTER 2 Food fortication: basic principles Food fortication is usually regarded as the deliberate addition of one or more micronutrients to particular foods, so as to increase the intake of these micro-nutrient(s) in order to correct or prevent a demonstrated deciency and providea health benet. The extent to which a national or regional food supply is for-tied varies considerably. The concentration of just one micronutrient might beincreased in a single foodstuff (e.g. the iodization of salt), or, at the other endof the scale, there might be a whole range of food-micronutrient combinations. The public health impact of food fortication depends on a number of param- eters, but predominantly the level of fortication, the bioavailability of the for-ticants, and the amount of fortied food consumed. As a general rule, however,the more widely and regularly a fortied food is consumed, the greater the pro-portion of the population likely to benet from food fortication. 2.1 Terminology 2.1.1 Food fortication For the purpose of these guidelines, food fortication is dened as the practice of deliberately increasing the content of essential1micronutrients - that is to say, vitamins and minerals (including trace elements) - in a food so as to improvethe nutritional quality of the food supply and to provide a public health benetwith minimal risk to health. The public health benets of fortication may eitherbe demonstrable, or indicated as potential or plausible by generally accepted sci-entic research, and include: Prevention or minimization of the risk of occurrence of micronutrient de- ciency in a population or specic population groups. Contribution to the correction of a demonstrated micronutrient deciency in a population or specic population groups. 241The word \"essential\" means any substance that is normally consumed as a constituent of food which is needed for growth and development and the maintenance of healthy life and whichcannot be synthesized in adequate amounts by the body ( 61).A potential for an improvement in nutritional status and dietary intakes that may be, or may become, suboptimal as a result of changes in dietaryhabits/lifestyles. Plausible benecial effects of micronutrients consistent with maintaining or improving health (e.g. there is some evidence to suggest that a diet rich inselected anitoxidants might help to prevent cancer and other diseases). The Codex General Principles for the Addition of Essential Nutrients to Foods (61) denes \"fortication\", or synonymously \"enrichment\", as \"the addition of oneor more essential nutrients to a food whether or not it is normally contained inthe food, for the purpose of preventing or correcting a demonstrated deciencyof one or more nutrients in the population or specic population groups\".The Codex General Principles go on to state that the rst-mentioned condi-tion for the fullment of any fortication programme \"should be a demonstratedneed for increasing the intake of an essential nutrient in one or more pop-ulation groups. This may be in the form of actual clinical or subclinical evidenceof deciency, estimates indicating low levels of intake of nutrients or possibledeciencies likely to develop because of changes taking place in food habits\" ( 61). The broad denition of fortication used in these guidelines extends the inter- pretation of public health need prescribed by the Codex General Principles for the Addition of Essential Nutrients to Foods (61) in that it also incorporates plau- sible public health benets that may be derived from increased micronutrientintakes (as opposed to merely demonstrable benets), based on new and evolv-ing scientic knowledge. The broader denition thus encompasses the growingrange of different types of food fortication initiatives that have been imple-mented in recent years in response to an increasingly diverse set of public healthcircumstances. Clearly, the public health signicance of the potential benets of food fortication is primarily a function of the extent of the public health problem.Generally speaking, therefore, when deciding to implement a fortication programme, priority should be given to controlling those nutrient decienciesthat are most common in the population and that have the greatest adverse effecton health and function. In Part II of these guidelines, appropriate criteria thatcan be applied to the determination of the signicance of the public healthproblem are described; these criteria are largely expressed in terms of the preva-lence and severity of MNM. Ideally this should be determined at the countryor regional level. 2.1.2 Related codex terminology The following denitions are used in these guidelines as follows:2. FOOD FORTIFICATION: BASIC PRINCIPLES 25Restoration is the addition of essential nutrients to foods to restore amounts originally present in the natural product that are unavoidably lost during pro-cessing (e.g. milling), storage or handling. Nutritional equivalence is achieved when an essential nutrient is added to a product that is designed to resemble a common food in appearance, texture,flavour and odour in amounts such that the substitute product has a similarnutritive value, in terms of the amount and bioavailability of the added essen-tial nutrient. An example is the addition of vitamin A to margarine sold as abutter substitute, in an amount equal to butter's natural content. Appropriate nutrient composition of a special purpose food describes the addition of an essential nutrient to a food that is designed to perform a specic func-tion (such as meal replacement or a complementary food for young children),or that is processed or formulated to satisfy particular dietary requirements,in amounts that ensure that the nutrient content of the food is adequate andappropriate for its purpose. Whereas restoration and nutritional equivalence are strategies aimed at correct- ing food supply changes that could otherwise adversely affect public health, theterm \"fortication\" tends to be reserved for essential nutrient additions thataddress specic public health needs. Nevertheless, all the Codex categories ofnutrient additions adopt, albeit to a varying degree, the general aim of provid-ing a public health benet. 2.2 Types of fortication Food fortication can take several forms. It is possible to fortify foods that are widely consumed by the general population (mass fortication1), to fortify foods designed for specic population subgroups, such as complementary foods foryoung children or rations for displaced populations (targeted fortication) and/or to allow food manufacturers to voluntarily fortify foods available in themarket place (market-driven fortication 2). Generally speaking, mass fortication is nearly always mandatory, targeted fortication can be either mandatory or voluntary depending on the publichealth signicance of the problem it is seeking to address, and market-drivenfortication is always voluntary, but governed by regulatory limits (Figure 2.1) . The choice between mandatory or voluntary food fortication usually dependson national circumstances. For example, in countries where a large proportionof maize flour is produced by small mills, enforcement of mandatory fortica-GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 261Mass fortication is \"free-market\" fortication.tion might be impractical. Under such circumstances, one option would be, if feasible, to allow small mills to fortify their product on a voluntary basis but fol-lowing specied regulations. 2.2.1 Mass fortication As indicated above, mass fortication is the term used to describe the addition of one or more micronutrients to foods commonly consumed by the generalpublic, such as cereals, condiments and milk. It is usually instigated, mandatedand regulated by the government sector. Mass fortication is generally the best option when the majority of the pop- ulation has an unacceptable risk, in terms of public health, of being or becom-ing decient in specic micronutrients. In some situations, deciency evidenced by unacceptably low intakes and/or biochemicalsigns of deciency. In others, the population may not actually be decientaccording to usual biochemical or dietary criteria, but are likely to benet fromfortication. The mandatory addition of folic acid to wheat flour with a view tolowering the risk of birth defects, a practice which has been introduced inCanada and the United States, and also in many Latin American countries, isone example of the latter scenario. 2.2.2 Targeted fortication In targeted food fortication programmes, foods aimed at specic subgroups of the population are fortied, thereby increasing the intake of that particular group2.

Examples include complementary foods for infants and young children, foods developed for school feeding pro-grammes, special biscuits for children and pregnant women, and rations (blended foods) for emergency feeding and displaced persons ( Table 2.1 ). In some cases, such foods may be required to provide a substantial proportion ofdaily micronutrient requirements of the target group. The majority of blended foods for feeding refugees and displaced persons are managed by the World Food Programme (WFP) and guidelines covering theirfortication (including wheat soy blends and corn soy blends) are already avail-able ( 62). Although blended foods usually supply all or nearly all of the energy and protein intake of refugees and displaced individuals, especially in the earlierstages of dislocation, for historical reasons such foods may not always provideadequate amounts of all micronutrients. Therefore, other sources of micronu-trients may need to be provided. In particular, it may be necessary to add iodizedsalt to foods, provide iron supplements to pregnant women or supply high-dosevitamin A supplements to young children and postpartum women. Wheneverpossible, fresh fruits and vegetables should be added to the diets of displacedpersons relying on blended foods (see Chapter 4: section 4.5). Fortied foodsfor displaced persons are often targeted at children and pregnant or lactatingwomen. 2.2.3 Market-driven fortication The term \"market-driven fortication\" is applied to situations whereby a food manufacturer takes a business-oriented initiative to add specic amounts of oneor more micronutrients to processed foods. Although voluntary, this type of foodfortication usually takes place within government-set regulatory limits (seeChapter 11: National food law). Market-driven fortication can play a positive role in public health by con- tributing to meeting nutrient requirements and thereby reducing the risk ofmicronutrient deciency. In the European Union, fortied processed foods havebeen shown to be a substantial source of micronutrients such as iron, and vita-GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 28TABLE 2.1 Targeted food fortication programmes Country Food Target population Guatemala Incaparina Indonesia Complementary foods InfantsMexico ProgresaPeru Ali Alimentu Schoolchildren South D ( 63,64 ). Market-driven fortication can also improve the supply of micronutrients that are otherwise difcult to add in sufcient amountsthrough the mass fortication of staple foods and condiments because of safety, technological or cost constraints. Examples include certain minerals (e.g. iron,calcium) and sometimes selected vitamins (e.g. vitamin C, vitamin B 2). Market-driven fortication is more widespread in industrialized countries, whereas in most developing countries the public health impact of market-drivenfood interventions is still rather limited. However, their importance is likely tobe greater in the future, because of increasing urbanization and wider availabil- ity of such foods. The predicted increase in the availability of fortied processed foods in devel- oping countries has given rise to a number of concerns. Firstly, these fortiedfoods - especially those that are attractive to consumers - could divert con-sumers from their usual dietary pattern and result in, for example, an increasedconsumption of sugar, or a lower consumption of bre. Secondly, because inmost developing countries foods fortied through market-driven forticationcurrently receive scant regulatory attention even though such foods are intendedfor wide-scale consumption (see section 2.3), there is a potential risk that unnec-essarily high levels of micronutrients may be delivered to children if the sameserving size of the fortied food (such as breakfast cereals, beverages and nutri-tion bars) is intended for all members of a household. Regulation is thus nec-essary to ensure that the consumption of these foods will not result in anexcessive intake of micronutrients. Furthermore, manufacturers of processedfortied foods should be encouraged to follow the same quality control andassurance procedures as those that are prescribed for mandatory mass-fortiedproducts (see Chapter 8: Monitoring and evaluation). 2.2.4 Other types of fortication 2.2.4.1 Household and community fortication Efforts are under way in a number of countries to develop and test practical ways of adding micronutrients to foods at the household level, in particular, to complementary foods for young children. In effect, this approach is a combi-nation of supplementation and fortication, and has been referred to by some as \"complementary food supplementation\" ( 65). The efcacy and effectiveness of several different types of products, includ- ing soluble or crushable tablets, micronutrient-based powder (\"sprinkles\") andmicronutrient-rich spreads are currently being evaluated ( Table 2.2 ). Crushable tablets, and especially micronutrient-based powder, are relatively expensive waysof increasing micronutrient intakes, certainly more costly than mass fortica-tion, but may be especially useful for improving local foods fed to infants andyoung children, or where universal fortication is not possible ( 66). The2. FOOD FORTIFICATION: BASIC PRINCIPLES 29micronutrient-dense fortied spreads have been found to be very popular with children ( 67). Fortication of foods at the community level is also still at the experimental stage. One such approach involves the addition of a commercial micronutrientpremix, available in sachets, to small batches of flour during the milling process(68). Although feasible in theory, major challenges to local-scale fortication programmes include the initial cost of the mixing equipment, the price of thepremix (which would need to be imported in most cases), achieving and main-taining an adequate standard of quality control (e.g. in uniformity of mixing),and sustaining monitoring and distribution systems. 2.2.4.2 Biofortication of staple foods The biofortication of staple foods, i.e. the breeding and genetic modicationof plants so as to improve their nutrient content and/or absorption is anothernovel approach that is currently being considered.The potential for plant breed-ing to increase the micronutrient content of various cereals, legumes and tuberscertainly exists; for instance, it is possible to select certain cereals (such as rice)and legumes for their high iron content, various varieties of carrots and sweetpotatoes for their favourable -carotene levels, and maizes for their low phytate content (which improves the absorption of iron and zinc) ( 69-71 ). However, much more work still needs to be done before the efcacy and effectiveness ofthese foods are proven, and current concerns about their safety, cost and impact on the environment are alleviated ( 72).GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 30TABLE 2.2 Foods for fortication at the household level Product Comments Micronutrient powder Contain several micronutrients, including iron, encapsulated to which can be minimize adverse interactions between micronutrients andsprinkled onto food sensory changes to the food to which they are added; available in sachets Soluble micronutrient Suitable for young children; tablets which can be Tested by WHO dissolved in water and fed as a drink Crushable micronutrient For infants and young children tablets for adding to Tested by UNICEF foods Fat-based spread Popular with children fortied with Can be produced locally as the technology required is easy micronutrient to implement Sources: references ( 66,67 ).2.3 Legal considerations: mandatory versus voluntary fortication The huge diversity in national circumstances and public health goals worldwide has resulted in the development of many different approaches to the regulationof food fortication. In most industrialized countries, food fortication param-eters are established by law or through cooperative arrangements. Elsewhere,and representing the other end of the spectrum, fortied foods are producedwithout any form of governmental guidance or control at all. Since it is the roleof government to protect public health, it is generally recommended that allforms of food fortication be appropriately regulated in order to ensure thesafety of all consumers and the maximum benet to target groups. Within the legal context, fortication can be categorized as either mandatory or voluntary. These terms refer to the level of obligation required of food pro-ducers to comply with government intentions expressed in law. The fundamental distinction between mandatory and voluntary regulation as it applies to food fortication is the level of certainty over time that a particularcategory of food will contain a pre-determined amount of a micronutrient. Byproviding a higher level of certainty, mandatory fortication is more likely todeliver a sustained source of fortied food for consumption by the relevant pop-ulation group, and, in turn, a public health benet. 2.3.1 Mandatory fortication 2.3.1.1 Key characteristics Mandatory fortication occurs when governments legally oblige food produc- ers to fortify particular foods or categories of foods with specied micro-nutrients. Mandatory fortication, especially when supported by a properlyresourced enforcement and information dissemination system, delivers a highlevel of certainty that the selected food(s) will be appropriately fortied and inconstant supply. In deciding the precise form of mandatory fortication regulation, govern- ments are responsible for ensuring that the combination of the food vehicle and the forticants will be both efcacious and effective for the target group, yet safe for target and non-target groups alike. Food vehicles range from basic commodities, such as various types of flour, sugar and salt which are availableon the retail market for use by consumers as well as ingredients of processedfoods, to processed foods that are fortied at the point of manufacture.Given their widespread and regular consumption, basic commodities are more suited to mass fortication (i.e. intended to reach the whole population),whereas certain processed formulated foods are usually the better vehicle for targeted fortication initiatives (i.e. those aimed at specic populationgroups).2. FOOD FORTIFICATION: BASIC PRINCIPLES 31Globally, mandatory regulations are most often applied to the fortication of food with micronutrients such as iodine, iron, vitamin A, and increasingly folicacid. Of these, the iodization of salt is probably the most widely adopted form of mandatory mass fortication. In the Philippines, for example, the legal stan-dard for iodized salt, which is appended to the Philippine Act Promoting SaltIodization Nationwide, requires a minimum level of iodine fortication of allfood-grade salt destined for human consumption ( 6). This form of mandatory regulation is used in many other countries. Other examples of mandatory massfortication include the addition of vitamin A to sugar and margarine, and the fortication of flour with iron (usually together with restoration of vitamins B 1, B2and niacin), and, more recently, with folic acid and vitamin B 12. The types of food vehicles that are subjected to mandatory fortication are usually characterized by either a physical or an intrinsic attribute, or a spe-cic purpose. A requisite flour, for example, could be described as either white or wholemeal and/or milled from a particular grain, or destined for bread making. Alternatively, the prescribed fortication requirements may apply only to a food that is identied and labelled in a certain way. In the UnitedStates, for instance, only those flours and other grain products identied and labelled as \"enriched\" are required by law to contain added folic acid (andsome other essential micronutrients). Similarly, Australia and New Zealandmandate the addition of iodine only to salt identied and labelled as \"iodizedsalt\". Although the potential public health impact is more variable, mass forti-cation can be achieved under these conditions, particularly if the labelled for-tied foods constitute a major and stable share of the market for that food classas a whole. 2.3.1.2 Mandatory fortication in relation to public health Governments tend to institute mandatory fortication in situations where a pro-portion of the general population - either the majority (mass fortication) or anidentied population group (target fortication) - has a signicant public healthneed, or is at risk of being, or becoming, decient in a specic micronutrient(s),and where such needs or risks can be ameliorated or minimized by a sustainedsupply and regular consumption of particular fortied food(s) containing thosemicronutrients. Mandatory fortication is usually prompted by evidence that a given popu- lation is decient or inadequately nourished, such as clinical or biochemical signsof deciency and/or unacceptably low levels of micronutrient intake. In somecircumstances, a demonstrated public health benet of an increased consump-tion of a given micronutrient might be considered sufcient grounds to warrantmandatory fortication even if the population is not considered to be seriouslyatrisk according to conventional biochemical or dietary intake criteria. TheGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 32mandatory addition of folic acid to flour to reduce the risk of birth defects is a case in point. 2.3.2 Voluntary fortication 2.3.2.1 Key characteristics Fortication is described as voluntary when a food manufacturer freely chooses to fortify particular foods in response to permission given in food law, or underspecial circumstances, is encouraged by government to do so. The impetus for voluntary fortication usually stems from industry and con- sumers seeking to obtain possible health benets through an increase inmicronutrient intakes. Occasionally, however, government provides the drivingforce. Given this diversity in the circumstances that drive voluntary fortication,it is not surprising that the public health impacts range from negligible to sub-stantial. Indeed, depending on the nutritional quality of their basic diet, thoseindividuals who regularly consume fortied foods might well gain discernablebenets. However, it is important that governments exercise an appropriate degree of control over voluntary fortication through food laws or other cooperativearrangements, such as industry codes of practice. The degree of control shouldatleast be commensurate with the inherent level of risk. Regulatory controls of this nature should also ensure the safety of fortied foods for all consumers, aswell as provide opportunities for industry to produce fortied foods that offer consumers nutritional and/or other health benets. The potential benets maybe demonstrable, or indicated as potential or plausible by generally accepted scientic data. When instituting voluntary fortication arrangements, governments have a duty to ensure that consumers are not misled or deceived by fortication prac-tices and may also wish to be satised that market promotion of fortied foodsdoes not conflict with, or compromise, any national food and nutrition policies on healthy eating. This could be achieved through regulations on the range offoods eligible for voluntary fortication and on the permitted combinations ofparticular micronutrients and foods (see Chapter 11: National food law). Currently many countries permit voluntary fortication, but the range of foods that may be fortied varies considerably from country to country. SomeScandinavian countries allow only a narrow range of foods to be fortied,whereas the range of products that can be fortied is much greater in the UnitedStates. Similarly, the permitted forticants range from a select few to almost allmicronutrients that are considered essential. The level of industry uptake of fortication practice is greatly influenced by prevailing market conditions. For example, in many industrialized countries, thevast majority of processed breakfast cereals are moderately fortied with various2. FOOD FORTIFICATION: BASIC PRINCIPLES 33combinations of micronutrients, sometimes differentiated according to the target market; the remaining few are either highly or extensively fortied (where per-mitted) and/or unfortied. Other food categories, such as fruit juices or dairy products, tend to exhibit a greater variability in fortication rates, this beinginfluenced by market differentiation and brand identity. For some permitted cat-egories there may be no industry interest in fortication. 2.3.2.2 Voluntary fortication in relation to public health Voluntary fortication tends to be used when there are lower order risks to public health, i.e. when the risks to public health are not as serious or demonstrable soas to warrant mass fortication. Inadequate micronutrient intakes that arisebecause of changes in lifestyles that tend to follow changing social and economiccircumstances are more likely to be associated with lower order public healthrisks than inadequate intakes that arise because of signicantly modied eating habits and dietary behaviour. In addition, for certain nutrients, dietary require-ments have been reappraised in light of evolving scientic knowledge about theirphysiological role and the benecial effects on certain physiological processesand health conditions. Because of uncertainty about the level of industry uptake of fortication within each food product category, and the fact that regular consumers of agiven fortied food may vary over time and thus do not constitute a readily iden- tiable group, voluntary fortication is less likely than mandatory forticationto deliver a guaranteed favourable outcome in terms of increased intakes ofmicronutrients across a target population. Apart from the extent to which a givenfood category is fortied, the public health impact of voluntary forticationdepends on the contribution of that food category to the diet of the populationas whole, and also whether or not those individuals who would benet most fromfortication regularly consume and have access to that food category. Despite these inherent difculties, a consistent supply of appropriately regulated, voluntarily-fortied foods, produced under free-market conditionsand widely and regularly consumed by a given population group, can have abenecial impact on public health by positively contributing to micronutrientbalance and thereby reducing the risk of deciency. For example, in the European Union where fortication of margarine is voluntary, it is estimatedthat the addition of vitamins A and D to margarine and spreadable fats con- tributes about 20% of the reference nutrient intake for vitamin A and 30% of that for vitamin D ( 63). It has also been reported that by the 1990s fortied breakfast cereals had become the principal source of iron for young children inthe United Kingdom ( 64).GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 342.3.3 Special voluntary fortication Some voluntary fortication programmes are capable of achieving similar out- comes to mandatory fortication, thus avoiding the need for complex manda-tory legal requirements. A notable example is the Swiss programme of saltiodization. Circumstances that contribute to the success of voluntary fortica-tion in Switzerland and elsewhere include the existence of an industry that com-prises only a few producers or manufacturers and a strong government interestin industry practice (e.g. one that provides subsidies and ensures sustainable for-tication practices). Voluntary fortication initiatives are also more likely tosucceed when supported by public education activities that increase publicawareness of the importance of consuming the fortied food (see Chapter 10: Communication, social marketing and advocacy). 2.3.4 Criteria governing the selection of mandatory or voluntary fortication For any given population group, which may be either the entire population or a specic subgroup(s), there are ve key factors that together determine whethermandatory or voluntary fortication is likely to be the most appropriate optionfor the prevailing conditions. In brief, they are: the signicance of the publichealth need; the size and scale of the food industry sector; the level of aware-ness among the population about nutritional needs; the political environment;and food consumption patterns. These ve factors are described in more detailbelow, and in each case, an indication given of the circumstances that favour oneor the other of the two main regulatory mechanisms. 1.The signicance of the public health need or risk of deciency, as determined by the severity of the problem and its prevalence within a population group .The sig- nicance of the public health problem is of primary importance and shouldbe determined at the country or regional level, ideally with reference to setcriteria that describe the severity of the public health problem. The publichealth need or risk can be assessed according to evidence of clinical or subclinical deciency, inadequate nutrient intake, or potential health benet(see Part II: Evaluating the public health signicance of micronutrient malnutrition).2. FOOD FORTIFICATION: BASIC PRINCIPLES 35Mandatory fortication is more suited to cases of serious public health need or risk, and voluntary fortication to cases of lower order public health need or risk, or where the potential exists for some individuals to benet from, orto exercise, consumer choice. Under certain conditions, voluntary fortication can achieve similar public health impacts as mandatory fortication. 2.The features of the food industry sector that will responsible for the production of the proposed food vehicle. The aspects of the food industry sector that are espe- cially relevant in this context are the number, capacity and geographical dis-tribution of the producers, the presence of any government support orcontrol, and the prevailing commercial environment.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 36In developing countries in particular, mandatory fortication is more likely to succeed when the industry sector in question is either relatively centralized(i.e conned to a handful of major producers) and/or well organized. If it con- sists of numerous small, widely dispersed producers, mandatory forticationwill be more difcult to achieve, unless these small units have some form of collective arrangement in place, such as an established industry associa- tion. It is also the better option in settings where governments seeking highrates of industry participation do not have any alternative legal or adminis-trative arrangements that could potentially be used to institute voluntarycooperative arrangements within the industry. Voluntary fortication does not need to take account of industry arrange- ments but where there is a monopoly or a government-sponsored industry,the impact of voluntary arrangements can match those achieved by manda-tory fortication. 3.The relevant population's present level of knowledge about the importance of con- suming fortied foods or their interest in consuming fortied foods. The level of resources available for implementing and sustaining specic nutrition edu-cation programmes is also an important factor to consider when choosingthe most suitable regulatory environment for a food fortication programme. Mandatory fortication is likely to be the more effective option when consumer knowledge is poor or demand for voluntarily-fortied products is low, and there are few opportunities for community nutrition education. Voluntary fortication generally relies on consumer interest and/or demand for fortied foods. Although consumer behaviour is influenced by manyfactors, it could be engendered by commercial promotion or specic nutri- tion education programmes. 4.The political environment. In terms of the political environment, the accept- able level of government intervention and the value placed on informed con-sumer choice are probably the most signicant factors that affectingregulatory decisions.5.Food consumption patterns. Clearly, food consumption patterns, especially in terms of the relative contributions of certain foods to the diet of the targetpopulation, will have a bearing on the choice of mandatory or voluntary for-tication. Linked to this factor is the issue of the technical suitability of thecandidate food as a vehicle for fortication.2. FOOD FORTIFICATION: BASIC PRINCIPLES 37In environments where consumer choice is highly valued, both voluntary and mandatory fortication could be appropriate. In such settings, mandatory for- tication tends to be limited to a subset of products within one or more pro- posed food categories, in order to maintain some degree of consumer choice. Voluntary fortication usually confers a higher level of consumer choice; however, this is not the main issue in many developing countries, where poverty remains the limiting factor to access to processed foods for the majority of the population. Foods considered for mandatory fortication should be widely and regularly consumed by the population group that the fortication is intended to benet. In addition, the fortication itself should be technically feasible. The likelihood of all at-risk consumers increasing their usual micronutrient intake through voluntary fortication is lower than with mandatory fortica- tion. However, the likelihood rises as the particular micronutrient is added to a wider range of voluntarily-fortied foods, assuming they are accessible to consumers.PARTII Evaluating the public health signicance of micronutrient malnutritionIntroduction The chapters in Part II of these guidelines provide more detailed background information on the prevalence, causes and health consequences of variousmicronutrient deciencies, and review the available evidence regarding the ben-ets of their control. They are intended to assist planners not only in their eval-uation of the micronutrient deciency situation in their own country, but alsoto assess the need for, and potential benets of, food fortication with specicmicronutrients. Chapter 3 looks at iron, vitamin A and iodine deciencies, which, owing to their widespread occurrence globally, have received the most attention to date.A large amount of information is now available regarding the prevalence, thecauses and the control of deciencies in these three micronutrients. Variousstudies on the efcacy and effectiveness of interventions to control decienciesin iron, vitamin A and iodine, are briefly described here (and in the openingchapter of this document; see section 1.3), but are reviewed in greater depthelsewhere ( 73). Chapter 4 focuses on a range of other micronutrients, which, in comparison, have hitherto been somewhat neglected. Deciencies in at leastsome of these \"neglected\" micronutrients (i.e. in zinc, vitamins B 2and B 12, niacin, vitamin D and calcium) are likely to be common throughout much ofthe developing world and among the poorest populations in the industrializednations. Fortication provides a means of lowering the prevalence of decien-cies in all of these micronutrients, and their inclusion in mass fortication pro-grammes, in particular, could produce signicant public health benets. Since there is less information about these micronutrient deciencies in the literature,a concerted effort has been made to summarize what is known about them inthese guidelines. In both chapters, micronutrients are discussed in order of their perceived public health signicance, and in each case the recommended or the most com-monly used biochemical status indicators are critically reviewed. For somemicronutrients, however, biochemical data reflecting nutritional status will beinadequate for assessing the prevalence of deciencies. Suggestions for dealingwith this situation, for example, by using food intake data to estimate the preva-lence of inadequate intakes, are provided in Part IV of these guidelines (seesection 7.3.2). 41Other than a low dietary intake, important causes of MNM include poor bioavailability from foods (especially for minerals), frequent infection with par-asites, diarrhoea, and various malabsorption disorders. The presence of any of these risk factors can lead to an underestimation of the prevalence of deciencyin a population if this is calculated on the basis of micronutrient intakes alone. Risk factors for micronutrient malnutrition Monotonous diet resulting in low micronutrient intake, and poor bioavailability, espe- cially of minerals. Low intake of animal source foods. Low prevalence of breastfeeding. Low micronutrient density of complementary foods. Increased physiological demands for growth during pregnancy and lactation. Increased demand due to acute infection (especially if infection episodes are fre- quent), chronic infection (e.g. tuberculosis, malaria and HIV/AIDS) and disease (e.g. cancer). Poor general nutritional status, in particular, protein-energy malnutrition. Malabsorption due to diarrhoea or the presence of intestinal parasites (e.g. Giardia lamblia , hookworms). Increased excretion (e.g. due to schistosomiasis). Seasonal variations in food availability, food shortages. Social deprivation, illiteracy, low education. Poor economic status and poverty.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 42CHAPTER 3 Iron, vitamin A and iodine 3.1 Iron deciency and anaemia Most of the iron in the human body is present in the erythrocytes as haemo- globin, where its main function is to carry oxygen from the lungs to the tissues.Iron is also an important component of various enzyme systems, such as thecytochromes, which are involved in oxidative metabolism. It is stored in the liver as ferritin and as haemosiderin. Iron deciency is the most common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world, and is a public health problem in both industrialized and non-industrialized countries. Iron deciency is the result of a long-term negative ironbalance; in its more severe stages, iron deciency causes anaemia. Anaemia isdened as a low blood haemoglobin concentration. Haemoglobin cut-off valuesthat indicate anaemia vary with physiological status (e.g. age, sex) and have beendened for various population groups by WHO ( 1). 3.1.1 Prevalence of deciency The terms, \"iron-deciency anaemia\" are often used syn- onymously although they are in fact not the same conditions. About 40% of theworld's population (i.e. more than 2 billion individuals) is thought to suffer from anaemia, i.e. low blood haemoglobin (see Table 1.1) .The mean prevalences among specic population groups are estimated to be: \u2014pregnant women, infants and children fact that iron deciency and iron-deciency anaemia are even more prevalent in some parts of the world, especially in theIndian subcontinent and in sub-Saharan Africa, where, for example, up to 90%of women become anaemic during pregnancy. 43The prevalence of anaemia caused by iron deciency, usually referred to as iron-deciency anaemia, is less certain because the specic indicators protoporphyrin and transferrin receptors, are measured less often than blood haemoglobin(Table 3.1) .Most indicators of iron status - with the possible exception of serum transferrin receptors - are also affected by the presence of infection and cantherefore be misleading ( 74). Indeed, every indicator listed in T able 3.1 has its own set of limitations, and so iron status is best assessed by a combination of indicators ( 74). It is generally assumed that, on average, around 50% of the cases of anaemia are due to iron deciency, as opposed to malaria (which causes anaemia becausethe malaria parasite destroys erythrocytes), the presence of infection or othernutrient deciencies. However, the proportion is probably higher in infants andpreschool-aged children than in older children or women ( 75), and is likely to varybylocation. Although anaemia usually occurs when iron stores are depleted, the prevalence of iron deciency will often be substantially higher than theprevalence of iron-deciency anaemia. However, in iron-decient populationswith endemic malaria, the prevalence of anaemia will be greater than, or similarto, the prevalence of iron deciency ( 75). Furthermore, the use of serum fer- ritin as an indicator of iron status may well overestimate the prevalence of iron deciency in malaria endemic areas; this is because serum ferritin levels are ele-vated by the presence of infections such as malaria (T able 3.1), and also the reason why, traditionally, the cut-off level that dened iron deciency in indi-viduals with malaria was higher ( <30\u00b5g/l) than that used for individuals free from infection ( <15\u00b5g/l). Anaemia is considered to be a public health problem when the prevalence of low haemoglobin concentrations exceeds 5% in the population ( 1). The sever- ity of the public health problem of anaemia is classied as mild, moderate orsevere according to the prevalence of anaemia (Table 3.2) . 3.1.2 Risk factors for deciency The main risk factors for iron deciency have been summarized in Table 1.2 . They include: alow intake of haem iron (which is present in meat, poultry and sh); an inadequate intake of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) from fruit and vegetables (the presence of vitamin C enhances the absorption of iron from the diet); poor absorption of iron from diets high in phytate (including legumes and cereals) or phenolic compounds (present in coffee, tea, sorghum and millet);GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 443.

Sources: reference (1,74).periods of life when iron requirements are especially high (i.e. growth and pregnancy); heavy blood losses as a result of menstruation, or parasite infections such as hookworm, ascaris and schistosomiasis. As mentioned above, acute or chronic infections, including malaria, can also lower haemoglobin concentrations ( 76). The presence of other micronutrient deciencies, especially of vitamins A and B 12,folate and riboflavin, also increases the risk of anaemia ( 77). The dietary habits of a population group strongly affect the bioavailability of both dietary iron and added forticant iron. Estimates of the average bioavail-ability of iron from different types of diets are provided in Table 3.3 .Although the efciency of iron absorption increases substantially as iron stores become3.

As indicated previ- ously (see section 1.1), there is now substantial evidence to suggest that ironsupplementation can reverse the adverse effects of iron deciency on workcapacity and productivity, and on pregnancy outcome and child development(14-16 ). In a study in the United States, for example, iron supplementation during pregnancy reduced the number of preterm deliveries and low- birth-weight infants ( 83). Improving iron status may have other, but as yet poorly appreciated, benets for health, most noticeably with respect to the utilization of vitamin A and iodine.That vitamin A (retinol) is mobilized from the liver by an iron-dependentenzyme is well-established fact, but more recently, experimental studies havesuggested that in cases of iron deciency the vitamin is trapped in the liver and thus may be less accessible to other tissues and organs ( 84). Furthermore, iron supplementation of iron-decient individuals increased plasma retinol in some studies through mechanisms that are as yet incompletely understood(85). Similarly, iron is required by the enzymes that synthesize thyroxine, and thus a low iron status may have implications for iodine metabolism. Studies inC\u00f4te d'Ivoire have demonstrated that recovery from goitre after iodine treatmentis slower in iron-decient individuals ( 86). In a population of children with a high prevalence of anaemia and goitre, iron supplementation improved theresponse to iodized oil or iodized salt ( 87) (see also section 1.3.2.3). On the basis of the above ndings, it is reasonable to assume that improvements in the iron status of a population may well have benets for vitamin A and iodinemetabolism. 3.2 Vitamin A Vitamin A is an essential nutrient that is required in small amounts by humansfor the normal functioning of the visual system, the maintenance of cell func-tion for growth, epithelial cellular integrity, immune function and reproduction.Dietary requirements for vitamin A are normally provided as a mixture of pre-formed vitamin A (retinol), which is present in animal source foods, and provi-tamin A carotenoids, which are derived from foods of vegetable origin and whichGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 48have to be converted into retinol by tissues such as the intestinal mucosa and the liver in order to be utilized by cells. Aside from the clinical ocular signs, i.e. night blindness and xerophthalmia, symptoms of vitamin A deciency (VAD) are largely non-specic. Neverthe-less, accumulated evidence suggests that VAD is an important determinant ofchild survival and safe motherhood (see section 3.2.3). The non-specicity of symptoms, however, means that, in the absence of biochemical measures ofvitamin A status, it is difcult to attribute non-ocular symptoms to VAD and italso complicates the denition of VAD.With these considerations in mind,WHO has dened VAD as tissue concentrations of vitamin A low enough to haveadverse health consequences, even if there is no evidence of clinical xeroph-thalmia ( 5). In more recent years, the term \"vitamin A deciency disorders\" has been coined to reflect the diversity of adverse outcomes caused by vitamin Adeciency ( 88). 3.2.1 Prevalence of deciency As vitamin A deciency affects visual function, indicators of vitamin A status have traditionally relied on changes in the eye, specically night blindness andxerophthalmia ( 5)(Table 3.4) .Worldwide, about 3 million preschool-aged chil- dren present ocular signs of VAD ( 3). Vitamin A deciency is, however, more commonly assessed using serum or plasma retinol levels. WHO estimates that254 million preschool-aged children throughout the world have low serumretinol levels and can therefore be considered to be clinically or subclinicallyvitamin A decient ( 3). In the developing world, prevalence rates in this age group range from 15% up to as high as 60%, with Latin America, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Pacic being at the low end of this range, andAfrica and South-East Asia occupying the high end ( 3,89) (see also T able 1.1). The prevalence of night blindness is also high among pregnant women in manypoor regions of the world, with rates varying between 8% and 24% ( 89). Night blindness tends to be accompanied by a high prevalence of low concentrationsof retinol in breast 89,90 ). WHO criteria ( 5), a greater than 1% prevalence of night blind- ness in children aged 24-71 months, or the presence of serum retinol concen-trations of less than 0.70 \u00b5mol/l in 10% or more of children aged 6-71 months indicates a public health problem (Table 3.5) .It has been suggested recently that a prevalence of night blindness of more than 5% in pregnant women shouldbe added to the list of criteria that signify a public health problem ( 88). 3.2.2 Risk factors for deciency Usually vitamin A deciency develops in an environment of ecological, social and economical deprivation, in which the key risk factors for vitamin A 3.

Sources: references (5,91).deciency are a diet low in sources of vitamin A (i.e. dairy products, eggs, fruits and vegetables), poor nutritional status, and a high rate of infections, in partic-ular, measles and diarrhoeal diseases (see Table 1.2 ). The best sources of vitamin A are animal source foods, in particular, liver, eggs and dairy products, which contain vitamin A in the form of retinol, i.e ina form that can be readily used by the body. It is not surprising then that therisk of vitamin A deciency is strongly inversely related to intakes of vitamin A from animal source foods. In fact, it is difcult for children to meet their require-ments for vitamin A if their diet is low in animal source foods ( 92), especially if their diet is also low in fat. Fruits and vegetables contain vitamin A in the formof carotenoids, the most important of which is -carotene. In a mixed diet, the conversion rate of -carotene to retinol is approximately 12:1 (higher, i.e. less efcient than previously believed). The conversion of the other provitamin-Acarotenoids to retinol is less efcient, the corresponding conversion rate beingof the order of 24:1 ( 91,93 ). Various food preparation techniques, such as cooking, grinding and the addition of oil, can improve the absorption of foodcarotenoids ( 94-96 ). Synthetic -carotene in oil, which is widely used in vitamin A supplements, has a conversion rate to retinol of 2:1, and the synthetic formsof-carotene that are commonly used to fortify foods, a conversion rate of 6:1 ( 93). 3.2.3 Health consequences of deciency and benets of intervention Vitamin A deciency is the leading cause of preventable severe visual impair- ment and blindness in children, and signicantly increases their risk of severeillness and death. An estimated 250000-500000 vitamin A-decient childrenbecome blind every year, approximately half of which die within a year ofbecoming blind. Subclinical vitamin A deciency is also associated with anincreased risk of child mortality, especially from diarrhoea and measles. A meta-analysis demonstrated that high dose vitamin A supplementation can reducemortality from measles by as much as 50%. Another analysis found that3.

In addition to causing night blindness, vitamin A deciency is probably an important contributor to maternal mortality and other poor outcomes in preg-nancy and lactation. According to the results of one study, in which vitamin A-decient pregnant women received vitamin A or -carotene supplements at doses equivalent to their weekly requirement for the vitamin, maternal mortal-ity was reduced by 40% and 49%, respectively, relative to a control group ( 97). Other studies have shown night blindness to be a risk factor for maternal mor-tality and morbidity: in Nepal, for example, the death rate from infections wasabout ve times higher among unsupplemented pregnant women who reported night blindness compared with those who did not ( 98). Vitamin A deciency also increases vulnerability to other disorders, such as iron deciency ( see section 3.1.3 ). Providing an iron supplement with vitamin A to pregnant women in Indonesia increased haemoglobin concentrations by approximately 10g/l morethan did supplementation with iron alone ( 99). 3.3 Iodine Iodine is present in the body in minute amounts, mainly in the thyroid gland. Its only conrmed role is in the synthesis of thyroid hormones. Iodine deciencyis a major public health problem for populations throughout the world, but par-ticularly for young children and pregnant women, and in some settings repre-sents a signicant threat to national social and economic development.The mostdevastating outcome of iodine deciency is mental retardation: it is currentlyone of the world's main causes of preventable cognitive impairment. This is theprimary motivation behind the current worldwide drive to eliminate iodine de-ciency disorders (IDD). 3.3.1 Prevalence of deciency The recommended indicators for assessing the extent of iodine deciency within a population are median urinary iodine and total goitre prevalence ( Table 3.6 ). According to generally accepted criteria, iodine deciency is a public healthproblem in populations where the median urinary iodine concentration is below100\u00b5g/l, or in areas where goitre is endemic, that is to say, where more than 5% of children aged 6-12 years have goitre ( Table 3.7 ). As the median urinary iodine concentration reflects current iodine intake and responds relatively rapidly to the correction of iodine deciency, it is usually thepreferred indicator for monitoring the impact of interventions for IDD control.An expanded set of indicators for assessing national progress towards the goalof the sustainable elimination of IDDs is given in Annex A. This indicator set,GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 523.

Source: reference (6).which has been recommended by WHO, relates not just to the population's iodine status (as measured by urinary concentrations) but includes various pro-grammatic indicators which measure the sustainability of the salt iodization pro- gramme itself. According to recent WHO estimates, some 1989 million people have inade- quate iodine nutrition ( 2). The WHO regions, ranked by the absolute number of people affected are, in decreasing order of magnitude, South-East Asia,Europe, the Western Pacic, Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean and the Americas (see Table 1.1) .In some parts of the world, for example, in parts of eastern and western Europe, iodine deciency, in its subclinical form, is re-emerging, having previously been eliminated. This underscores the need tosustain efforts to control iodine deciency on a global scale. 3.3.2 Risk factors for deciency The main factor responsible for the development of iodine deciency is a low dietary supply of iodine ( 100). This tends to occur in populations living in areas where the soil has been deprived of iodine as the result of past glacia-tion, and subsequently, because of the leaching effects of snow, water and heavyrainfall. Iodine deciency is exacerbated by a high consumption of natural goitrogens that are present in some staple foods such as cassava. The antithyroid action ofgoitrogens is related to the presence of thiocyanate which inhibits thyroid iodidetransport and, at higher doses, competes with iodide in the synthesis of thyroidhormones ( 101). Goitrogenicity is determined by the balance between the dietary supply of iodine and thiocyanate: goitre develops when the urinary iodine(\u00b5g): thiocyanate (mg) ratio falls below 3. 3.3.3 Health consequences of deciency and benets of intervention Iodine deciency is associated with a large range of abnormalities, grouped under the heading of \"iodine deciency disorders\", that reflect thyroid GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 54TABLE 3.7 Criteria for assessing the public health severity of iodine deciency Severity of public Indicator health problem Median urinary iodine ( \u00b5g/l) Total goitre are the most visible manifestations of iodine deciency; others include hypothyroidism, decreased fertility rate,increased perinatal death and infant mortality (Table 3.8) . When iodine intake is abnormally low, an adequate production of thyroid hor- mones may still be achieved by increased secretion of thyroid stimulatinghormone (TSH). However, a prolonged stimulation of the thyroid gland by TSHwill result in goitre. This condition is indicative of thyroid hyperplasia, whichoccurs because of the thyroid's inability to synthesize sufcient thyroid hormones. Irreversible mental retardation is the most serious disorder induced by iodine deciency ( 9,102,103 ). A decit in iodine resulting in thyroid failure during the critical period of brain development, that is, from fetal life up to the thirdmonth after birth, will result in irreversible alterations in brain function(104,105 ). In areas of severe endemic iodine deciency, cretinism may affect up to 5-15% of the population. Some individuals living in regions of mild or mod-erate iodine deciency exhibit neurological and intellectual decits that are similar to, but less marked, than those found in overt cretins. A meta-analysis of19 studies conducted in regions of severe deciency showed that iodine de- ciency is responsible for a mean IQ loss of 13.5 points among affected popula-tions ( 104).3.

The positive impact of zinc supplementation on the growthof some stunted children, and on the prevalence of selected childhood diseasessuch as diarrhoea, suggests that zinc deciency is likely to be a signicant publichealth problem, especially in developing countries. However, the extent of zincdeciency worldwide is not well documented. All population age groups are atrisk of zinc deciency, but infants and young children are probably the most vulnerable. Pregnant and lactating women are also likely to be very susceptibleto zinc deciency, and there is an urgent need for more information on the impli-cations of low zinc status in these particular population groups ( 107,108 ). 4.1.1 Prevalence of deciency The lack of reliable and widely accepted indicators of zinc status of adequate sensitivity means that the global prevalence of zinc deciency is uncertain.Thoseindicators that are available, such as zinc concentration in plasma and hair (seeTable 4.1 ), detect changes in zinc status only in cases of severe deciency, and may fail to detect marginal deciency. As suggested above, there are, however, several good reasons to suspect that zinc deciency is common, especially in infants and children. Firstly, a highprevalence of low plasma zinc, which is a reasonable indicator of relatively severedepletion, has been observed in some population groups. Secondly, several ran-domized control trials have demonstrated that stunted children, and/or thosewith low plasma zinc, respond positively to zinc supplementation, a nding that suggests that zinc deciency was a limiting factor in their growth. Growthstunting affects about a third of children in less wealthy regions of the world and is very common in settings where diets are of poor quality. This is not too say that zinc deciency affects up to one third of children in the developingworld since zinc deciency is only but one of several possible causes of growth stunting. 57Using estimates of zinc intake and bioavailability derived from FAO's food balance data, it has been calculated that about 20% of the world's populationcould be at risk of zinc deciency. The geographical regions most affected arebelieved to be, in descending order of severity, south Asia (in particular,Bangladesh and India), Africa and the western Pacic ( 109). It is probable that the occurrence of zinc deciency is strongly associated with that of iron de-ciency, because both iron and zinc are found in the same foods (i.e. meat, poultryand sh) and, in both cases, their absorption from foods is inhibited by the pres-ence of phytates. The minerals differ in that zinc is not as affected by blood lossas is iron.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 58TABLE 4.1 Indicators for assessing zinc status at the population level Indicator Sample Population group Cut-off to dene Comments deciency Zinc Serum or Applies to all <70\u00b5g/dl No universally agreed plasma population cut-offs. groups Plasma zinc is homeostaticallyregulated and therefore may notdetect marginaldeciency.

Sources: references ( 91,93 ).4.1.2 Risk factors for deciency The central role of zinc in cell division, protein synthesis and growth means that an adequate supply is especially important for infants, and pregnant and lactat-ing women. Principal risk factors for zinc deciency include diets low in zinc orhigh in phytates, malabsorption disorders (including the presence of intestinalparasites and diarrhoea), impaired utilization of zinc and genetic diseases enteropathica, sickle-cell anaemia) ( Table 1.2 ). The bioavailability of zinc is dependent on dietary composition, in particu- lar, on the proportion of high-phytate foods in the diet (i.e. selected cereals andlegumes). The molar ratio of phytate:zinc in meals or diets provides a usefulmeasure of zinc bioavailability. At high ratios (i.e. above 15:1), zinc absorptionfrom food is low, that is to say, less than 15% ( 110,111 ). The inclusion of animal proteins can improve the total zinc intake and the efciency of zinc absorptionfrom a phytate-containing diet ( 112). For instance, the addition of animal source foods to a diet based on rice and wheat approximately doubled the amount ofzinc that was absorbed by young Chinese women ( 113). Using data obtained from experimental zinc absorption studies ,various criteria have been developed to differentiate between diets likely to have high, moderate and low zinc bioavail-ability; these are summarized in Tabl e4.2. The extent to which the presence of phytates inhibits the absorption of zinc is not precisely known at the present time. It is interesting to note that severalstudies have shown that zinc absorption from some legume-based diets is com-parable to that from a diet based on animal products, despite the relatively highphytate content of the former ( 112,114 ), and that in adult women, approxi- mately 30% of dietary zinc is absorbed across a wide range of different diets(93). In a controlled experiment, infants absorbed nearly 45% of the zinc from a wheat-soy complementary food, regardless of whether it contained 0.77% or0.3% phytic acid ( 115). In Malawi, 24% of the zinc was absorbed from high- phytate maize meals consumed by children, again a relatively high proportiongiven the phytate content ( 116). Competitive interactions can occur between zinc and other minerals that have similar physical and chemical properties, such as iron and copper.When presentin large amounts (e.g. in the form of supplements) or in aqueous solution, theseminerals reduce zinc absorption. However, at the levels present in the usual dietand in fortied foods, zinc absorption is not generally affected ( 93). On the other hand, high levels of dietary calcium (i.e. >1gper day), which might be con- sumed by some individuals, can inhibit zinc absorption, especially in the pres-ence of phytates. The degree of impairment varies depending on the type of dietand the source of the calcium ( 93). Unlike iron, zinc absorption is neither inhib- ited by phenolic compounds, nor enhanced by vitamin C.4.

Low Diets high in unrened, unfermented and ungerminated cereal grainsb, especially fortied with inorganic calcium salts and when intake ofanimal protein is negligible. Phytate: zinc molar ratio of total diet exceeds 15 c. High-phytate soy protein products constitute the primary protein source.Diets in which, singly or collectively, approximately 50% of the energy intake is from the following high-phytate foods: high-extraction-rate ( 90%) floursand tanok blackeyed beans, from calcareousgeophagia), potentiate the inhibitory effects; low intakes of animal proteinexacerbate these effects. aAt intakes adequate to meet the average normative requirements for absorbed zinc the three bioavailability levels correspond to 50%, 30% and 15% absorption. With higher zinc intakes,the fractional absorption is lower. bGermination of such grains or fermentation of many flours can reduce antagonistic potency;if cereal grains have been germinated then the diet should then be classied as having moderate zinc bioavailability. cVegetable diets with phytate:zinc ratios >30 are such diets, an assumption of 10% bioavailability of zinc or less may be justied, especially if the intake of protein is low,or the intake of inorganic calcium salts is excessive, or both. Source: reference ( 93). The influence of all of the above-mentioned risk factors for zinc deciency is difcult to integrate in any coherent way. In particular, further research isneeded to evaluate the bioavailability of zinc from usual diets in developingcountries and to better understand the relationship between dietary patterns andzinc supply.4.1.3 Health consequences of deciency and benets of intervention Zinc deciency is often hard to identify as its clinical manifestations are largely non-specic ( Table 1.2 ). The symptoms of severe deciency include dermati- tis, retarded growth, diarrhoea, mental disturbances and recurrent infections.Moderate and mild deciencies are even more difcult to diagnose, not onlybecause they are characterized by a diversity of symptoms, but also on accountof the fact that there are no suitable biomarkers of zinc deciency ( 117). In children, impaired growth (stunting) is one of the possible consequences of zinc deciency. Zinc supplementation trials conducted over the last fewdecades in children from developing countries have clearly demonstrated thepositive benets of improved zinc status, including improved growth rates andreductions in the incidence of various infectious diseases ( 17,18,118 ). For example, a meta-analysis an 18% decrease in incidence, a 25% reduction in diarrhoeaprevalence, and a 41% fall in the incidence of pneumonia ( 18). Zinc supple- mentation also led to fewer episodes of malaria and fewer clinic visits due tocomplications of malaria in Papua New Guinea ( 118), but not in Burkina Faso (119). The effect of maternal zinc status on pregnancy outcomes is unclear at the present time ( 120). Although severe zinc deciency has been associated with poor maternal pregnancy outcomes ( 121), studies involving moderate deciency have proved inconclusive ( 122). Maternal zinc supplementation in Peru improved fetal neurobehavioral development ( 123), but had no effect on size at birth or pregnancy duration ( 124). In India, zinc supplements helped to reduce mortality among low-birth-weight infants ( 125). Interestingly, the zinc content of breast milk has not been shown to correlate with maternal zinc intake andappears to be unaffected by supplementation ( 126,127 ). 4.2 Folate Folate (vitamin B 9) plays a central role in the synthesis and methylation of nucleotides that intervene in cell multiplication and tissue growth. Its role inprotein synthesis and metabolism is closely interrelated to that of vitamin B 12. The combination of severe folate deciency and vitamin B 12deciency can result in megaloblastic anaemia. Low intakes of folate are also associated with a higherrisk of giving birth to infants with neural tube defects and possibly other birth defects, and with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, cancer andimpaired cognitive function in adults. 4.2.1 Prevalence of deciency Serum folate is a good indicator of recent dietary folate intake, and the most widely used method of assessing folate status ( 128). Erythrocyte folate is,4. ZINC, B VITAMINS, VITAMINS C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 61however, the better indicator of long-term status and of tissue folate stores. Ele- vated plasma homocysteine concentrations are a strong predictor of inadequate folate status. However, other vitamin deciencies (e.g. vitamins B 2,B 6and B 12) also increase homocysteine values. Indicators of folate status are summarized inTable 4.3 (93,128,129 ). The global prevalence of folate deciency is uncertain, owing to a lack of data (130). Only a few countries have national or even regional biochemical data on folate status. Furthermore, efforts to compare usual dietary intakes with esti-mated requirements (an alternative means of assessing the likely prevalence of deciency in a population) are hampered by difculties in measuring the folatecontent of foods.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 62TABLE 4.3 Indicators for assessing folate (vitamin B 9) status at the population level Indicator Sample Population Cut-off to dene Comments group deciency Folate Serum Applies to <10nmol/l Serum folate is the most population (4.4 \u00b5g/l) widely used indicator groups of folate status.

Sources: references ( 93,128,129 ).Folate deciency tends to be more prevalent in populations that have a high intake of rened cereals (which are low in folate) and a low intake of leafy greensand fruits (which are high in folate). Dietary surveys in India show that people eating predominantly cereal-based diets only consume about 75 \u00b5g folate per day ( 131). Prior to the introduction of mandatory wheat flour fortication with folic acid in 1998, about 15% of adult women in the United States were believedto have low serum and/or erythrocyte folate levels. Similarly, in Chile, where theconsumption of white wheat flour is high, low serum and erythrocyte folate con-centrations were common before the fortication of flour with folic acid ( 132). In contrast, low plasma values are rare in countries such as Guatemala, Mexicoand Thailand ( 77) where diets typically contain a higher proportion of fruits and vegetables. For instance, few whole blood samples from the Mexican National Nutrition Survey were low in folate, with the exception of those of childrenunder 4 years of age, in which the prevalence of low blood folate was about 10%(133). Because of the high folate content of certain legumes, fruits and vegeta- bles relative to rened cereals, it is possible that populations in some develop-ing countries consume more folate than those in industrialized countries.Similarly, a study of pregnant women in Germany found that those who arelacto-ovo vegetarians (i.e. milk and egg consumers) or low meat consumers hadhigher levels of erythrocyte folate than the non-vegetarians; this was attributedto the fact that the lacto-ovo vegetarians were consuming proportionately morefolate-rich vegetables than their non-vegetarian counterparts ( 134). 4.2.2 Risk factors for deciency The main sources of dietary folate are leafy green vegetables, fruits, yeast and liver. A low intake of these foods combined with a relatively high intake of renedcereals thus increases the risk for folate deciency. Malabsorption Giardia lamblia, bacterial overgrowth, genetic disorders (of folic acid metabolism) and chronic alcoholism are also risk factors for folate de-ciency (see Table 1.2 ). 4.2.3 Health consequences of deciency and benets of intervention Possible health consequences of a low folate status, which include megaloblas- tic anaemia, are summarized in T able 1.2. Folic acid has long been included iniron supplements provided to pregnant women in developing countries, despiterather limited evidence from Africa and India that folic acid reduces the risk ofmegaloblastic anaemia. In fact, there is little evidence to suggest that giving folicacid with iron is any better at preventing anaemia than providing iron alone(77,135 ). Randomized trials conducted in China ( 136), the United States ( 137) and in various other locations have consistently shown that folic acid supplements taken4. ZINC, B VITAMINS, VITAMINS C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 63before and during the rst 28 days after conception reduce the risk of women giving birth to an infant with a neural tube defect ( 138). Neural tube defects are serious malformations resulting in death or major lifelong disability in sur-vivors; worldwide, an estimated 300000 or more neonates are affected each year(139). Studies have also demonstrated that folic acid supplementation benets some women who have an abnormal folate metabolism because of a geneticdefect that affects their ability to utilize folate ( 140). Moreover, an analysis of data from different trials in which micronutrients were provided during preg-nancy found folic acid to be the only micronutrient that was associated with a reduced risk of preterm delivery ( 141). Several intervention trials have demonstrated that folic acid fortication lowers plasma homocysteine, even in populations with a relatively low preva-lence of folate deciency ( 49). Several lines of evidence indicate that even moderately elevated plasma homocysteine is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease ( 142) and stroke ( 143), both leading causes of death in many countries. While there is still some controversy concerning the directionof causality ( 144), a comparison of the results of genetic and prospective epidemiological studies, which would be expected to have different biases,strongly points to a direct causal pathway leading from elevated homocysteineto cardiovascular disease ( 145). Higher plasma homocysteine levels are also associated in industrialized countries with a higher risk of impaired cognitivefunction in adults ( 146), and many abnormal pregnancy outcomes, including eclampsia and premature delivery, and other birth defects such as orofacial cleftpalate and heart defects. However, the evidence for the benets of supplemen-tation for these conditions is not as strong than that linking supplementation toprevention of neural tube defects ( 147). The addition of folic acid to enriched grain products in the United States, a practice which, as mentioned above, was introduced in 1998, has since produceda substantial increase in average blood folate levels among women of child-bearing age ( 148).This has resulted in the virtual elimination of low serum folate (149) and the lowering of plasma homocysteine in the population at large ( 49). The level of folic acid added (140 \u00b5g/100g flour) is unlikely to bring total folate intakes above the T olerable Upper Intake Level (UL) of 1000 \u00b5g per day in any life stage or gender group ( 128), or to exacerbate or obscure problems caused byvitamin B 12deciency (see section 4.3). 4.3 Vitamin B 12 Vitamin B 12(cobalamin) is a cofactor in the synthesis of an essential amino acid, methionine. Its metabolic role is closely linked to that of folate in that one of thevitamin B 12-dependent enzymes, methionine synthase, is vital to the functioning of the methylation cycle in which 5-methyltetrahydrofolate acts as a source ofGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 64methyl donor groups which are necessary for cell metabolism and survival. Deciency of this vitamin can thus impair the utilization of folate and causesneurological deterioration, megaloblastic anaemia, elevated plasma homocys- teine and possibly, impaired immune function. In infants and young children itcan cause severe developmental delays. 4.3.1 Prevalence of deciency Vitamin B 12status is usually assessed by measuring concentrations in plasma or serum ( Table 4.4 ) (93,128,129 ) Although elevated urinary plasma methyl- malonic acid (MMA) levels are more specic, and often more sensitive, indica-tors of vitamin B 12deciency, MMA concentrations are more difcult and expensive to measure than those of vitamin B 12.Elevated homocysteine is a good predictor of vitamin B 12status.4.

Sources: references ( 93,128,129 ).Variability in the plasma levels used to dene vitamin B 12deciency (see Table 4.4 ) make the results of the few studies of its prevalence difcult to gen- eralize. Moreover, there is no clear evidence that vitamin B 12deciency varies with countries or regions. In countries where vitamin B 12deciency has been assessed at the national level, low serum vitamin B 12concentrations were preva- lent, i.e. in Venezuela (11-12% in preschool and school-aged children), Germany(15% in women of reproductive age), the United Kingdom (31% of the elderly)and New Zealand (12% of the elderly). The prevalence was lower in the UnitedStates (0-3% in preschool and school-aged children, adults and the elderly) andin Costa Rica (5.3% in lactating women). In smaller studies, a high proportionof low plasma vitamin B 12concentrations were found in Kenya (40% in school- aged children), Zimbabwe (24% of the elderly), Israel (21% in adults), and India(46% in adults), while in other countries such as Botswana (preschool-aged children), Thailand (school-aged children) and Japan (adults), <1% of plasma vitamin B 12concentrations were low ( 130,150-152 ). 4.3.2 Risk factors for deciency Vitamin B 12is synthesized by microorganisms in the gut of animals and is sub- sequently absorbed and incorporated into animal tissues. Products from her-bivorous animals (i.e. meat, eggs, milk) are thus the only source of the vitaminfor humans. Consequently, intakes are very low or close to zero in many popu-lation groups that are economically disadvantaged, or among those who avoidanimal products for religious or other reasons. There is a high risk of deciencyin strict vegetarians and even lacto-ovo vegetarians (i.e. milk and egg consumers)have lower plasma concentrations of the vitamin compared with meat-consumers ( 153). Low maternal intake and/or status in the lactating mother will lead to inadequate amounts of vitamin B 12in breast milk, and subsequently, deciency in the infant. Malabsorption syndromes and some inborn errors ofmetabolism are also risk factors for vitamin B 12deciency. Gastric atrophy, which occurs with ageing and following prolonged Heli- cobacter pylori infection, results in very poor absorption of vitamin B 12from food. However, the crystalline form of the vitamin that is used as a forticant and insupplements can still be absorbed by most individuals. For this reason, Canadaand the United States recommend that their elderly population, more than 20%of which is likely to have some level of vitamin B 12deciency, should consume a substantial part of their recommended vitamin B 12intake as fortied foods and/or supplements ( 128). The prevalence of vitamin B 12deciency due to gastric atrophy may be even higher in developing countries, due to a much earlierage of onset and a higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 664.3.3 Health consequences of deciency and benets of intervention Moderate to severe vitamin B 12deciency results in megaloblastic anaemia and the demyelination of the central nervous system, and in turn, various neurolog-ical disorders. The latter are variably reversible after correction of the deciency(154). When serum vitamin B 12concentrations fall below 150pmol/l, abnormal- ities in the function of some enzymes may occur with the risk, at lower con-centration, of potentially irreversible poor memory and cognitive function,impaired nerve conduction and megaloblastic anaemia in individuals of all ages.In a peri-urban area of Guatemala City, for example, schoolchildren with lowplasma vitamin B 12performed less well on tests of perception and memory, were less accurate in a reasoning (oddity) task, and had poorer academic perform-ance and adaptability ( 155). Infants fed with breast milk from vitamin B 12- decient mothers exhibited a failure to thrive, poor brain development and, insome cases, mental retardation ( 156). Several studies, mainly from industrialized nations, have demonstrated the benets of vitamin B 12supplementation in susceptible population groups. For example, vitamin B 12supplementation of decient infants born to strictly vege- tarian mothers reduced the incidence of anaemia and tremors, and improvedtheir general development ( 156). Among the elderly, vitamin B 12supplementa- tion produced improved symptoms in those with clinical signs of deciency(157). T o date, few vitamin B 12intervention trials have been carried out in developing countries. A recent supplementation programme involving Kenyanschoolchildren has, however, reported signicant reductions in the prevalence of vitamin B 12deciency in those receiving supplements of meat or milk com- pared with placebo or energy-supplemented groups ( 152). 4.4 Other B vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin B 6) As the food sources of the various B-complex vitamins are similar, it is not sur- prising that diets inadequate in one B vitamin are more than likely to be de-cient in the others. These water-soluble vitamins are readily destroyed duringcooking in water and by heat (although niacin is stable to heat). More signi-cantly, the milling and degerming of cereal grains removes almost all of the thiamine (vitamin B 1), riboflavin (vitamin B 2) and niacin (vitamin B 3), which is the reason why restoration of these particular nutrients to wheat and corn flourhas been widely practised for the last 60 years. This strategy has certainly con-tributed to the virtual elimination of vitamin B deciencies and their associateddiseases (i.e. beriberi and pellagra) in the industrialized countries. Historically, little attention has been paid to the assessment of thiamine, riboflavin, niacin and vitamin B 6status. One of the reasons why these B-complex4. ZINC, B VITAMINS, VITAMINS C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 67vitamins have been neglected in the past is the lack of reliable information about the consequences of marginal or subclinical deciencies (see Table 1.2 ). However, evidence is mounting that vitamin B deciencies are highly prevalentin many developing countries, in particular where diets are low in animal prod-ucts, fruits and vegetables, and where cereals are milled prior to consumption.Pregnant and lactating women, infants and children are at the highest risk ofdeciency. Because the mother's intake and body stores of these vitamins affectthe amount she secretes in breast milk, appropriate fortication can provide herwith a steady supply during lactation and thereby improve the vitamin B statusof her infants and young children. 4.4.1 Thiamine Thiamine (vitamin B 1) is a cofactor for several key enzymes involved in carbo- hydrate metabolism and is also directly involved in neural function. It is likely that thiamine deciency, in its subclinical form, is a signicant public healthproblem in many parts of the world. Severe deciency causes beriberi, a diseasethat was once commonplace among populations with a high carbohydrate intake,especially in the form of white rice. As mentioned above, beriberi has beenlargely eradicated in most industrialized countries, but the disease still occurs insome Asian countries where rice is the staple food. In addition, outbreaks ofberiberi are regularly reported in regions suffering social and economic stressbrought about by war, famine and other emergency situations. 4.4.1.1 Prevalence of deciency The most widely used biochemical indicators is increased in thiaminedeciency (see Table 4.5 ). UTE provides information about the adequacy of dietary intakes of thiamine, but not about the degree of depletion of tissuereserves. Nor is it a very sensitive indicator in cases of subclinical deciency.Both ETKA and TPPE reflect tissue reserves of thiamine and provide a directfunctional evaluation at the cellular level. ETKA is generally regarded as the bestsingle test of thiamine status, despite some reports of poor correlations betweenthis and other measures of thiamine status. Ideally ,ETKA should be used in combination with TPPE in order to conrm a diagnosis of thiamine deciency . In lactating women, the concentration of thiamine in breast milk can be used asan indicator of thiamine deciency. Although the lack of reliable biochemical data means that it is not known just how widespread a problem subclinical thiamine deciency is, thiamine levels inbreast milk coupled with infant mortality rates can provide valuable informationon the likelihood of the existence of thiamine deciency in a community.

Although far less prevalent than in the past, recent cases of severe thiamine deciency or beriberi have been reported in Indonesia ( 159) and the Seychelles (160). The disease still appears in Japan and in north-eastern parts of Thailand where intakes of raw sh (which contain an anti-thiamine compound, thiami-nase) and polished rice are high ( 161,162 ). Thiamine depletion is also a fairly regular occurrence among displaced populations and in refugees dependent onmilled white cereals in countries such as Djibouti, Ethiopia, Guinea, Nepal andThailand ( 158), which would suggest that refugees, displaced populations and those affected by famines are among those at especially high risk for thiaminedeciency .Sporadic outbreaks of thiamine deciency have occurred in The Gambia, the number of cases peaking during the rainy season, i.e. a time of foodshortages ( 163) and in Cuba during the 1992-1993 epidemic of neuropathy (164). Despite the concomitant nature of poor thiamine status and the outbreak of neuropathy in the Cuban outbreak, it is by no means certain that thiaminedeciency was responsible for the wide-scale neuropathy ( 165). 4.4.1.2 Risk factors for deciency The main sources of thiamine are wheat germ and yeast extracts, offal from most animals, legumes (i.e. pulses, groundnuts and beans) and green vegeta-bles. A low intake of animal and diary products and legumes, and a high con-sumption of rened rice and cereals are thus the main risk factors for thiaminedeciency. A diet rich in foods that contain high levels of anti-thiamine com-pounds is an additional risk factor. The most common thiamine antagonist isGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 70TABLE 4.6 Proposed criteria for assessing the public health severity of thiamine deciency Indicator Severity of public health problem (% of population below the cut-off value dening deciency, unless otherwise stated) Mild Moderate Severe Clinical signs (clinical cases) <1 (or 1 clinical case) 1-4 5 TPPE 5-19 20-49 50 Infant mortality between No decline in Slight peak in Marked peak in2 ndand 5th month mortality rates mortality rates mortality rates TPPE, thiamine pyrophosphate effect.

Anti-thiamine compounds may also be found in tea, ferns and betel nuts ( 169). Chronic alcohol abuse and genetic dis- orders are also risk factors for thiamine deciency (see Table 1.2 ). 4.4.1.3 Health consequences of deciency and benets of intervention There are two distinct forms of severe thiamine deciency: an oedematous form known as wet beriberi and a non-oedematous neurological form known as dryberiberi. The wet form is associated with potentially fatal heart failure, whereasthe dry form tends to be chronic and results in peripheral neuropathy. Manycases of thiamine deciency present with a mixture of symptoms and thus areproperly termed \"thiamine deciency with cardiopathy and peripheral neuro-pathy\" ( 158). Thiamine deciency in infants is rarely seen today, and is largely conned to infants who are breastfed by thiamine-decient mothers. In suchcases, it is almost always an acute disease, involving oedema and cardiac failurewith a high fatality rate. The Wernicke-Korsakov syndrome is induced by thiamine deciency and usually manifests as various neurological disorders that are typically associatedwith impaired cognitive function. It is only observed in chronic alcoholics or inthose with a genetic abnormality in transketolase, a thiamine-dependent enzyme. Several studies have indicated that supplementation can reverse the symp- toms of thiamine deciency. During an outbreak of beriberi in The Gambia, for example, the affected groups responded well to thiamine supplementation ( 163). 4.4.2 Riboflavin Riboflavin (vitamin B 2) precursor of most notably flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and various metabolic pathways and in energy production. Riboflavindeciency rarely occurs in isolation, and is frequently associated with decien-cies in one or more of the other B-complex vitamins. 4.4.2.1 Prevalence of deciency The urinary excretion of riboflavin, which is reduced in case of deciency, hasbeen used in several studies to assess riboflavin status. Urinary riboflavin reflectsrecent intake of the vitamin, but it is not a particularly good indicator of bodystores ( Table 4.7 ). A more useful functional test in this respect is the erythro- probably the best measure of riboflavin status: not only is this less susceptible to short-term fluc- tuations, but it is also more stable than EGRAC values ( 171).4.

Abnormal riboflavin-dependent enzyme function has been reported in almost all pregnant women in The Gambia ( 173); in 50% of elderly and 77% of lactating women in Guatemala ( 174); and in 87% of night-blind women in rural Nepal ( 171). Fur- thermore, in a survey in China, urinary riboflavin was low in more than 90% ofadults ( 175). 4.4.2.2 Risk factors for deciency The main dietary sources of riboflavin are meat and dairy products; only small amounts are found in grains and seeds. Leafy green vegetables are also a fairlygood source of riboflavin and in developing countries tend to be the main sourceof the vitamin. Deciency is thus likely to be more prevalent among those whoseintake of animal source foods is low. In common with several of the other B-complex vitamins, chronic alcoholism is also a risk factor. 4.4.2.3 Health consequences of deciency and benets of intervention Symptoms of riboflavin deciency are non-specic. Early symptoms mayinclude weakness, fatigue, mouth pain, burning eyes and itching. More advanceddeciency is characterized by dermatitis with cheilosis and angular Table 1.2 ). Riboflavin deciency also reduces the absorption and utilization of iron for haemoglobin synthesis. Itis possible that riboflavin deciency is a contributory factor in the high preva-lence of anaemia worldwide (see section 3.1.1 ), a suggestion which is supported byreports from The Gambia and Guatemala that riboflavin supplementation improved the haemoglobin response to iron supplementation in anaemic sub-jects ( 176,177 ). Almost nothing is known about the effects of milder deciency, although depletion studies conducted in the United States found evidence ofelectroencephalogram abnormalities. 4.4.3 Niacin Niacin (nicotinic acid or vitamin B 3), as a functional group of the coenzymes, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphate for oxidative processes. Deciency results in pellagra and is associated witha heavily cereal-based diet that is low in bioavailable niacin, tryptophan (anamino acid) and other micronutrients needed for the synthesis of niacin andtryptophan. Niacin is unique among the vitamins in that at least part of thebody's requirement for it can be met through synthesis from an amino acid (tryptophan): the conversion of 60mg tryptophan (via a niacin derivative) pro-duces 1mg of niacin.4. ZINC, B VITAMINS, VITAMINS C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 734.4.3.1 Prevalence of deciency There are no direct indicators of niacin status ( Table 4.8 ). Assessment is there- fore based on the measurement of one or preferably more urinary metabolitesof niacin, such as N'-methyl-nicotinamide (NMN) (which reflects recent dietaryintake) or the ratio of 2-pyridone:NMN. Provisional criteria proposed by WHOfor dening the severity of the public health problem based on these biomark-ers are listed in Table 4.9 . At present, evaluation of the prevalence of niacin deciency is almost entirely based on occurrence of clinical signs of deciency, i.e. pellagra. There is verylittle biochemical information on niacin status, and thus on the prevalence ofsubclinical deciency, from developing countries. Pellagra was widespread in parts of southern Europe and in the United States during the 19th and early 20th centuries, but fortication of cereal grain prod-ucts has since all but eradicated the condition from industrialized countries. It is, however, still common in India, and in parts of Africa and China, especially where populations are dependent on maize-based diets. More recently, pellagrahas been reported in areas where diets are largely sorghum-based, and wherethere is a dependence on polished rice. The prevalence of pellagra is also highamong displaced populations living in refugee camps based in south and easternparts of Africa ( 178). For example, up to 6.4% of Mozambican refugees based in Malawi were affected by an outbreak of pellagra ( 179). 4.4.3.2 Risk factors for deciency Niacin is widely distributed in plant and animal foods. The main sources are baker's yeast, animal and dairy products, cereals, legumes and leafy green vegetables. Niacin depletion is a risk where diets rely heavily on rened grains or grain products and have little variety. Severe deciency, pellagra, is predom-inantly found in people who consume diets that are decient in bioavailableniacin and low in tryptophan, such as maize- or sorghum-based diets. In maize, niacin is largely present in a bound form, only 30% of which bioavailable. However, the bioavailability of this bound form of niacin can beimproved by hydrolysis with a mild alkali. The soaking of maize in lime water,as is traditionally done in the preparation of tortillas in some Latin American countries, releases niacin from niacytin, and thus increases the amount of niacinthat can be absorbed. Bound niacin can be also be released by heat: the roast-ing of coffee beans, for instance, increases the bioavailability of the nicotinic acidcontent from 20 to 500mg/kg ( 167). These practices possibly account, at least in part, for the absence of pellagra in Latin America. The regular consumptionof milk and rice can also help prevent pellagra; although they are low in niacin,milk and rice are rich in tryptophan.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 744.

The most characteristic sign of pellagra is a symmetrically pigmented rash on areas of skinexposed to sunlight. Other manifestations include changes in the mucosa of thedigestive tract, leading to oral lesions, vomiting and diarrhoea, and neurologicalsymptoms such as depression, fatigue and loss of memory. 4.4.4 Vitamin B 6 Vitamin B 6is in fact a group of three naturally-occurring compounds: pyridoxine (PN), pyridoxal (PL) and pyridoxamine (PM). The different forms of vitamin B 6are phosphorylated and then oxidized to generate pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP), which serves as a carbonyl-reactive coenzyme to various enzymes involved in the metabolism of amino acids.Vitamin B 6deciency alone is relatively uncommon, but occurs most often in association with decienciesof the other B vitamins. 4.4.4.1 Prevalence of deciency Although there are several biochemical indicators of vitamin B 6status ( Table 4.10), all suffer from limitations of one kind or another. For this reason, vitamin B6status is best evaluated by using a combination of indicators. The absence of a suitable single indicator means that vitamin B 6status has only rarely been assessed at the population level but according to a recent report from Indone-sia, low intakes among children are likely to be common; among the childrensurveyed about 10% of those from urban areas and 40% of those from ruralareas exhibited biochemical signs of deciency ( 180). Moreover, about 40% of lactating mothers in Egypt had low concentrations of vitamin B 6in breast milk, and both these women and their infants presented abnormal behaviours ( 181).GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 76TABLE 4.9 Proposed criteria for assessing the public health severity of niacin deciency Indicator Severity of public health problem (% of population below the cut-off value dening deciency) Mild Moderate Severe Clinical signs (clinical reference ( C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 77TABLE 4.10 Indicators for assessing vitamin B 6(pyridoxine) status at the population levela Indicator Sample Population Cut-off to dene deciency Comments group Plasma Adults <20 nmol/l <10 nmol/l Probably the best indicator of vitamin B 6status.

Sources: references (93,128,129 ).4.4.4.2 Risk factors for deciency Vitamin B 6is widely distributed in foods, but meats, wholegrain products, veg- etables and nuts are especially good sources of the vitamin. Cooking and storagelosses range from a few percent to nearly half of the vitamin B 6originally present. Plants generally contain pyridoxine (PN), the most stable form, while animalproducts contain the less stable pyridoxal (PL) and the functional PLP form.In common with several of the other B vitamins, low intakes of animal productsand a high consumption of rened cereals are the main risk factors for vitaminB 6deciency. Similarly, chronic alcoholism is an additional risk factor for deciency. 4.4.4.3 Health consequences of deciency and benets of intervention Symptoms of severe vitamin B 6deciency are non-specic ( Table 1.2 ) and include neurological disorders (i.e. epileptic convulsions), skin changes (i.e. der-matitis, glossitis, cheilosis) and possibly anaemia. Vitamin B 6deciency is a risk factor for elevated plasma homocysteine ( 182). In trials, vitamin B 6supplements increased secretion of the vitamin in the breast milk of lactating women ( 183). 4.5 Vitamin C Vitamin C is a redox system comprised of ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid, and as such acts as an electron donor. Its main metabolic function is themaintenance of collagen formation. It is also an important antioxidant. Althoughsevere vitamin C deciency (scurvy) is now relatively rare, the prevalence ofmilder or marginal deciency is probably quite high. 4.5.1 Prevalence of deciency Concentrations of ascorbic acid in blood plasma or serum reflect recent intakes of vitamin C, and in this respect, are more reliable indicators of vitamin C statusthan ascorbic acid concentrations in erythrocytes ( Table 4.11 ). White blood cell (leukocyte) ascorbic acid concentrations are more closely related to tissue storesand probably provide the most sensitive indicator of vitamin C status, but beingtechnically more difcult to measure, are impractical for routine and large-scalepopulation surveys. Criteria for dening the public health signicance of vitaminC deciency, as proposed by WHO, are given in Table 4.12 . Despite its near eradication, severe vitamin C deciency (scurvy) still occurs periodically in displaced populations maintained for long periods of time (i.e.3-6 months) on food aid and without access to fresh fruit and vegetables ( 184). Outbreaks have been repeatedly reported from refugee camps in the Horn ofAfrica (i.e. Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, Sudan) and Nepal.

Scurvy has also been observed in selected popula- tion groups, such as infants, and in some communities of mine labourers ( 188). In contrast, the prevalence of mild vitamin C deciency worldwide is prob- ably fairly high. In the United States, data from the third National Health andNutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III 1988-1994) have indicated thatthe prevalence of marginal vitamin C deciency (dened as less than 0.3mgascorbic acid per 100ml serum) is about 9% in women and 13% in men ( 189). 4.5.2 Risk factors for deciency Vitamin C is widely available in foods of both plant and animal origin, but the best sources are fresh fruits and vegetables, and offal. As germination increasesvitamin C content, germinated grains and pulses also contain high levels ofvitamin C. However, because vitamin C is unstable when exposed to an alka-line environment or to oxygen, light and heat, losses may be substantial duringstorage and cooking. Deciency is usually a result of a low consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, caused by any one or a combination of factors such as seasonal unavailability, transportation difculties and/or unaffordable cost. Displacedpopulations who rely on cooked, fortied rations and who do not have accessto fresh fruits and vegetables are at a high risk for deciency. For these popu-lation groups, vitamin C supplementation is recommended, at least until theyare able to obtain a more normal diet. Chronic alcoholics, institutionalizedelderly and people living on a restricted diet containing little or no fruits andvegetables, are also at risk of vitamin C deciency. As the vitamin C content of cow's milk is low, infants represent a further subgroup that is potentially high-risk for vitamin C deciency. There have been a number of reports - across several world regions - of scurvy in infants fed on evaporated cow's milk(191,192 ).GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 80TABLE 4.12 Proposed criteria for assessing the public health severity of vitamin C deciency Indicator Severity of public health problem (% of population) Mild Moderate Severe Clinical signs (clinical cases) <1 1-4 5 ).4.5.3 Health consequences of deciency and benets of The clinical symptoms of scurvy include follicular hyperkeratosis, haemorrhagic manifestations, swollen joints, swollen bleeding gums and peripheral oedema,and even death. These symptoms appear within 3-4 months of consuming dietswith a very low vitamin C content ( <2mg per day). In infants, manifestations of scurvy include a haemorrhagic syndrome, signs of general irritability,tenderness of the legs and pseudoparalysis involving the lower extremities (seeTable 1.2 ).The adverse effects of mild deciency are uncertain, but may include poor bone mineralization (due to slower production of collagen), lassitude,fatigue, anorexia, muscular weakness and increased susceptibility to infections. As vitamin C increases the absorption of non-haem iron from foods, a low intake of vitamin C will exacerbate any iron deciency problems, especially inindividuals who consume only small amounts of meat, sh or poultry. Indeed,anaemia is a frequent manifestation of scurvy.The addition of vitamin C to iron-fortied foods greatly improves the absorption of the iron. In Chile, for example,it was necessary to also add vitamin C to iron-fortied dried milk consumed byyoung children before any signicant improvements in iron status could be detected ( 40) (see also section 5.1.2.1 ). 4.6 Vitamin D Vitamin D is one of the most important regulators of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis. It also plays many roles in cell differentiation and in the secretionand metabolism of hormones, including parathyroid hormone and insulin.Vitamin D (calciferol) is synthesized in the skin of most animals, includinghumans, from its precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol, by the action of sunlight.Thisproduces a naturally-occurring form of the vitamin known as vitamin D 3. Vitamin D can also be obtained from the diet, either as vitamin D 3or as a closely- related molecule of plant origin known as vitamin D 2.Since both forms are metabolized by humans in much the same way, from a nutritional perspective,vitamin D 3and vitamin D 2can be considered to be equivalent. Vitamin D 3is metabolized rst in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D 3), and then in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25-(OH) 2-D 3), which is the biologi- cally active form of the vitamin. Severe vitamin D deciency produces the bone disease called rickets in infants and children, and osteomalacia in adults, conditions which are charac-terized by the failure of the organic matrix of bone to calcify. The global preva-lence of vitamin D deciency is uncertain, but it is likely to be fairly commonworldwide, and especially among infants and young children, the elderly and those living at high latitudes where daylight hours are limited in the wintermonths.4. ZINC, B VITAMINS, VITAMINS C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 814.6.1 Prevalence of deciency In infants and young children, a concentration of 25-OH-D in serum below about 27.5nmol/l (11ng/ml) is indicative of a low vitamin D status ( Table 4.13 ). An elevated serum concentration can also indicatevitamin D phosphatase is in patients with ricketsor osteomalacia but is not specic to either of these conditions. In adults, thecombination of low plasma 25-OH-D and elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH)is probably the most reliable indicator of vitamin D deciency ( 193). In the absence of biochemical data, the existence of rickets in infants and children, anda high fracture risk among the elderly population, would suggest that vitamin Ddeciency might be a public health problem. Breast-fed infants who are not exposed to sunlight are unlikely to obtain enough vitamin D from breast milk beyond the rst few months of life, espe-cially if their mother's stores of the vitamin are low. Vitamin D deciency ininfants as a result of low maternal stores and/or infant exposure to sunlight(especially during winter months) has been reported in countries as diverse asChina ( 194) and France ( 195). Infants and children on macrobiotic diets tend to have a high prevalence of rickets, due to the low vitamin D content of mater-nal milk and the absence of fortied cow's milk in their diets ( 196). Children living in the far northerly latitudes, whose exposure to ultraviolet light is low especially during the winter months, are at high risk for rickets ( 197). Vitamin D deciency is also common in adults living at higher latitudes: forGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 82TABLE 4.13 Indicators for assessing vitamin D status at the population level Indicator Sample Population Cut-off to dene Comments group combination with groups parathyroid hormone is a valuable indicatorof vitamin D status.

In Beijing, 45% of adolescent girls were found to be decient ( 199). 4.6.2 Risk factors for deciency Most (about 80%) of the vitamin D in the body is produced in the skin. This process usually supplies all of the vitamin D needed by infants, children andadults. However, above and below latitudes 40\u00b0N and 40\u00b0S, the intensity of ultra-violet radiation in sunlight is not sufcient to produce adequate amounts ofvitamin D in exposed skin during the 3-4 winter months. At the very high lat-itudes, synthesis can be inadequate for as long as 6 months of the year. Inade-quate synthesis in winter is seen as far south as Turkey and Israel; low serumlevels of vitamin D are also highly prevalent in the winter in Delhi, India (29 oN) (200). Vitamin D synthesis in the skin will also be inadequate if the body is con- sistently covered by clothing, a probable factor in the high prevalence of de-ciency among veiled women (e.g. Kuwaiti women) and their breast-fed infantsand children ( 201). In the elderly, dietary requirements for vitamin D are increased because the ability of the skin to synthesize this vitamin decreases with age; at age 65 years,vitamin D synthesis in the skin is about 75% slower than that in younger adults.Dark-skinned individuals synthesize less vitamin D when exposed to ultravioletlight, and are therefore more vulnerable to deciency at low levels of exposureto ultraviolet light. In the United States, cases of rickets have been reportedamong black breast-fed children ( 202), and according to the results of a recent national survey, 42% of African-American women had low plasma vitamin Dconcentrations ( 56). Being naturally present in relatively few foods, dietary sources of vitamin D usually supply only a small fraction of the daily requirements for the vitamin.Salt-water sh such as herring, salmon, sardines and sh liver oil are the maindietary sources. Small quantities of vitamin D are found in other animal prod-ucts (e.g. beef, butter), and if hens are fed vitamin D, eggs can provide sub-stantial amounts of the vitamin. Because the consumption of these foods tendsto be relatively low, in industrialized countries most dietary vitamin D comesfrom fortied milk and margarine. Milk only provides small amounts of vitaminD unless it is fortied. Several studies have shown that the effects of poor vitamin D status are exac- erbated by low calcium intakes.This has been demonstrated in adults from India(200) and in children from Nigeria ( 203). The Nigerian children with nutri- tional rickets responded better to calcium, with or without vitamin D, than tovitamin D alone ( 203).4. ZINC, B VITAMINS, VITAMINS C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 834.6.3 Health consequences of deciency and benets of intervention The clinical features of rickets include bone deformities and changes in the cos- tochondral joints. The lesions are reversible after correction of vitamin D de-ciency. In osteomalacia, in which the loss of calcium and phosphorus from bonecauses it to lose strength, the main symptoms are muscular weakness and bonepain, but little bone deformity. Osteomalacia contributes to osteoporosis, a con-dition in which the bone becomes more brittle and porous due to the loss ofbone tissue. Vitamin D supplementation reduced seasonal loss of bone tissue inNorth American women ( 204), and prevented fractures associated with osteo- porosis in the elderly. In many locations, the addition of vitamin D to selected foods has proved to be a prudent public health measure. The vitamin has been added to milk inCanada and the United States since the 1920s, a policy that has been largelyresponsible for the elimination of vitamin D deciency rickets in children.However, low intakes of fortied dairy products by some elderly individuals, andbysome black populations, are still associated with a much higher risk of vitamin D deciency among these groups. 4.7 Calcium Calcium is the most abundant mineral in the body. Most ( >99%) of the body's 1000-1200g of calcium is located in the skeleton where it exists as hydroxya- patite. In addition to its role in maintaining the rigidity and strength of the skele-ton, calcium is involved in a large number of metabolic processes, includingblood clotting, cell adhesion, muscle contraction, hormone and neurotransmit-ter release, glycogen metabolism, and cell proliferation and differentiation. Osteoporosis, a disease characterized by reduced bone mass and thus increased skeletal fragility and susceptibility to fractures, is the most signicantconsequence of a low calcium status. Although an adequacy of calcium is impor-tant during the whole life span, it is especially important during childhood andadolescence (as these are periods of rapid skeletal growth), and for post-menopausal women and the elderly whose rate of bone loss is high. 4.7.1 Prevalence of deciency Unfortunately there are no practical population level indicators of calcium status (Table 4.14 ). Serum calcium, for example, is regulated by a complex homeo- static mechanism, which makes it an unreliable indicator of calcium status. Forthis reason, in most countries the prevalence of deciency is not known. In theabsence of reliable biochemical indicators, the best indication of calcium ade-quacy at present, especially for developing countries, is probably provided bycomparing dietary intakes with recommended nutrient FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 84the variability and uncertainty in the currently recommended intakes for calcium (93,193 ). On the basis of the fact that intakes of dairy products are low, it is thus highly likely that low or very low calcium intakes are very common in devel-oping countries. Measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) have provided an alternative means of assessing the likely extent ofcalcium deciency in some countries. In the United States, for example, it hasbeen estimated that 5-6 million older women and 1-2 million older men haveosteoporosis. Other approaches include measuring markers of bone resorptionin urine or plasma, which tend to be higher in calcium decient individuals.Such methods are, however, relatively expensive. All of the above measures areaffected by, among many other factors, vitamin D status, level of physical activ-ity and hormone levels, which further complicates the assessment of calciumadequacy at the population level. 4.7.2 Risk factors for deciency Intakes of calcium will almost certainly fall below the recommended levels where dairy product intake is low. Dairy products supply 50-80% of dietary calciumin most industrialized countries, while foods of plant origin supply about 25%.The calcium content of, and contribution from, most other foods is usually rel-atively small. Calcium absorption efciency is increased by a low calcium status and by a low dietary calcium content. Absorption is homeostatically controlledthrough regulation by vitamin D. The strongest known inhibitor of calciumabsorption is dietary oxalate, followed by the presence of phytates ( 193). Oxalate is not an important factor in most diets (although it is high in spinach, sweetpotatoes and beans) but phytates are often consumed in large amounts, forinstance, in legumes and wholegrain cereals.4.

Sources: references ( 93,193 ).4.7.3 Health consequences of deciency and benets of fortication The numerous metabolic roles of calcium are sustained even when intakes are low, because calcium is withdrawn from the bone should homeostatic mecha-nisms fail to maintain an adequate calcium status in the extracellular fluid. Thusinadequate calcium intakes lead to decreased bone mineralization and subse-quently an increased risk for osteoporosis in adults ( Table 1.2 ). In healthy individuals, bone mineral density increases until about 30 years of age, and thereafter begins to decline. Low intakes during childhood and ado-lescence can reduce peak bone density and thus increase the risk of osteoporo-sis in adulthood. The age of onset and severity of osteoporosis depends not onlyon the duration of inadequate calcium intakes, but also on a number of otherfactors, such as estrogen levels, vitamin D status and level of physical activity. Although rickets is usually associated with vitamin D deciency (see section 4.6), rickets has been observed in vitamin D-replete infants who also had low calcium intakes ( 203). In Chinese children aged 5 years from China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong SAR), intakes of <250mg calcium per day were associated with a 14% lower bone mineral content and a 4% reduc-tion in height relative to those consuming twice as much calcium ( 205). Sup- plementation of Gambian children with 1000mg calcium per day improvedtheir bone mineralization ( 206). It has been suggested that calcium may confer other benets, including the prevention of cancer and hypertension, but the roleplayed by calcium in such diseases is unclear at the present time. 4.8 Selenium Selenium is an essential element and a key constituent of at least 13 selenopro-teins. These can be grouped into a number of distinct families, the glutathioneperoxidases and the thioredoxin reductases, which are part of the antioxidantdefence system of cells, and iodothyronine deiodinase, an enzyme which con-verts the inactive precursor of thyroxine, tetraiodothyronine (T 4) into the active form, tri-iodothyronine (T 3). In humans, the biological roles of selenium include the protection of tissues against oxidative stress, the maintenance of the body'sdefence systems against infection, and the modulation of growth and develop-ment. Severe deciency can result in Keshan or Kaschin-Beck disease, whichare endemic in several world regions. 4.8.1 Prevalence of deciency There are several reliable indicators of selenium status, such as the concentra- tion of selenium in plasma, urine, hair or nails. However, the measurement ofselenium in human samples presents a number of technical difculties, a factorthat limits the usefulness of such measures as indicators of status ( Table 4.15 ). Indeed, the lack of simple assay techniques for selenium means that currentlyGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 864.

RBC, red blood cell. aSelenium status is probably best assessed by means of a combination of indicators. Sources: references (93,208 ).there are no suitable biochemical indicators of selenium status that are appro- priate for use in population surveys. Information regarding the prevalence ofselenium deciency is thus largely based on clinical observations and limited to the more severe forms, i.e. Keshan or Kaschin-Beck disease. Selenium deciency is endemic in some regions of China ( 207), where Keshan disease was rst described, and also in parts of Japan, Korea,Scandinavia and Siberia. Endemic deciency tends to occur in regions charac-terized by low soil selenium. For example, the distribution of Keshan diseaseand Kaschin-Beck disease in China reflects the distribution of soils from whichselenium is poorly available to rice, maize, wheat and pasture grasses. Fortica-tion of salt and/or fertilizers with selenium is crucial in these parts of the world. 4.8.2 Risk factors for deciency Usual diets in most countries satisfy selenium requirements. As indicated in the previous section, deciency occurs only where the soil, and consequently thefoods produced on those soils, is low in available selenium. Worldwide, the sele- nium content of animal products and that of cereals and plants, varies widely (at least 10-fold) depending on soil selenium content ( 209). The selenium content of foods of plant origin ranges from less than 0.1 \u00b5g/g to more than 0.8\u00b5g/g, while the amount in animal products ranges from 0.1 to 1.5 \u00b5g/g (210). Where animal feeds are enriched with selenium, such as in the United States,the selenium content of animal products may be much higher. Concentrationsof less than 10ng/g in the case of grain and less than 3ng/g in the case of water-soluble soil selenium have been proposed as indexes to dene selenium-decientareas ( 93). In industrialized countries, meat provides about half of the dietary selenium. It is also a good source in areas of low soil selenium because animals absorbmore of this nutrient when their intake is low. A low intake of animal sourcefoods is thus likely to increase the risk of selenium deciency. It is generallyassumed that the bioavailability of selenium from the diet is high. 4.8.3 Health consequences of deciency and benets of intervention Keshan disease is a cardiomyopathy associated with a low selenium intake and low levels of selenium in blood and hair. Reports of its occurrence across a widezone of mainland China rst appeared in the mainstream scientic literature inthe 1930s. It has since also been observed in some areas of the southern Siberia.Symptoms include cardiac insufciency and arrhythmias, congestive heartfailure and heart enlargement ( 211), which are responsive to supplementation with sodium selenite. Because some features of Keshan disease cannot beexplained by selenium deciency alone, other contributing factors have beensuggested, in particular, infection with the cocksackie virus ( 212).GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH deciency syndrome known as Kaschin-Beck or Urov disease is found in parts of China and Siberia, and in Japan and Korea. This is a diseaseof cartilage tissue that occurs in pre-adolescent and adolescent children, causing osteoarthropathy, joint problems and growth stunting. Like Keshan disease,additional causal factors have been proposed to account for the etiology ofKeschin-Beck disease, including exposure to mycotoxins from Fusarium mould (213), mineral imbalances and iodine deciency ( 214). Low intakes of selenium have been linked to a reduced conversion of the thyroid hormone, T 4to T 3.The metabolic interrelations between selenium and iodine are such that deciencies in one can sometimes exacerbate problems withthe other. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, for instance, combined sele-nium and iodine deciencies were shown to contribute to endemic myxoede- matous cretinism. Administration of selenium alone appeared to aggravate thisdisease; by restoring selenium-dependent deiodinase activity, the synthesis anduse of thyroxine (T 4) and iodine is increased, thereby exacerbating the iodine deciency ( 215). Low selenium intakes have also been associated by some researchers with an increased incidence of cancer, in particular, oesophagealcancer and also with cardiovascular disease ( 216). In areas of endemic selenium deciency, fortication with selenium has been shown to rapidly increase plasma glutathione peroxidase levels and urinary sele-nium. For example, when selenium was added to fertilizers in Finland in 1984,plasma selenium levels doubled by 1991 and glutathione peroxidase activity wasnormalized ( 217). In addition, according to the results of large-scale survey (over 1 million people) selenium fortication of table salt has signicantlyreduced the prevalence of Keshan disease in China ( 218). 4.9 Fluoride Unlike the other micronutrients considered in these guidelines, fluoride is not generally considered to be an essential nutrient according to the strict denitionof the term (see Chapter 2: section 2.1.1 ). Nevertheless, fluoride is undoubtedly protective against tooth decay. 4.9.1 Prevalence of dental caries There are no universally agreed methods for assessing fluoride status and no generally accepted criteria with which to dene deciency. However, concen-trations in urine have sometimes been used as an indicator of fluoride status(Table 4.16 ). The prevalence of dental caries is 40-60% lower in those areas of the United States where water is fluoridated compared with those where it is not. However,the increased use of fluoridated toothpaste and supplements by infants and4. ZINC, B VITAMINS, VITAMINS C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 89young children has made it difcult to differentiate between the benecial effects of a fluoridated water supply and that of other sources of the mineral. 4.9.2 Risk factors for low intakes Fluoride intake from most natural water supplies will be relatively low; a low flu- oride content of water is thus the main risk factor for a low intake of this mineral.In Canada and the United States, for instance, water sources typically containless than 0.4mg/l, which compares with concentrations of 0.7-1.2mg/l in fluor-idated supplies. Moreover, the fluoride content of breast milk is low and foodscontain well below 0.05mg per 100g, with exception of those prepared withfluoridated water and infant formulas. 4.9.3 Health consequences of low intakes and benets of intervention If ingested in water or foods, fluoride will become incorporated into the mineral of growing teeth and thus make them more resistant to decay. Continued expo-sure of the tooth surfaces to fluoride throughout life is also benecial because itreduces the ability of bacteria to cause decay and promotes the remineralizationof decayed areas. For these reasons, the addition of fluoride to public water sup-plies, or to salt or milk, can be an effective public health strategy for dental cariesprevention ( 219). This practice does not increase the risk of osteoporosis for older individuals in the population ( 220), and according to the results of some studies, might even lower the risk ( 221,222 ). Excessive fluoride intake carries a risk of enamel fluorosis, especially during the rst 8 years of life. In severe cases of this condition, the enamel of the toothbecomes stained and pitted; in enamel acquires not fluoride intakes 0.10mg/kg body weight per day ( 193). In adults, excessive fluoride intake can result in skeletalGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 90TABLE 4.16 Indicators for assessing fluoride status at the population levela Indicator Sample Population Cut-off to dene Comments group deciency Fluoride Urine Applies to all <0.5 mg/l No universally agreed criteria for population dening deciency.groups The following cut-offs >1.5 mg/l. aAt present there are no universally agreed methods for assessing fluoride status. Source: reference ( 193).fluorosis, with symptoms that include bone pain, and in more severe cases, muscle calcication and crippling. Mild skeletal fluorosis only occurs at fluorideintakes that are in excess of 10mg/day for more than 10 years. Symptoms of skeletal fluorosis are rarely seen in communities where the fluoride content ofwater supplies is below 20ppm (20mg/l). 4.10 Multiple micronutrient deciencies 4.10.1 Prevalence and risk factors Based on what is known about the prevalence of deciencies in individual micronutrients, it is probable that multiple micronutrient deciencies arecommon in several parts of the world and in certain population groups.Micronutrient deciencies are more likely to coexist in individuals who consumediets that are poor in nutritional quality, or who have higher nutrient require-ments due to high growth rates and/or the presence of bacterial infections orparasites. In particular, a diet that is low in animal source foods typically resultsin low intakes of bioavailable iron and zinc, calcium, retinol (pre-formed vitaminA), vitamin B 2(riboflavin), vitamin B 6and vitamin B 12.Often, poor quality diets also lack fresh fruits and vegetables, which means that intakes of vitamin C(ascorbic acid), -carotene (provitamin A) and folate will also be inadequate. The milling of cereals removes several nutrients, notably, iron and zinc, variousB vitamins (i.e. thiamine, riboflavin, niacin) and folate. Individuals who relyheavily on rened cereals are thus at increased risk of deciency of all of thesemicronutrients. The breast milk of undernourished lactating women consuminga limited range of foods and with multiple micronutrient deciencies, is mostlikely to be low in concentrations of vitamin A (retinol), the B vitamins, iodineand selenium. If the micronutrient content of breast milk is inadequate foroptimal infant development, maternal supplementation may be required untiladequate fortication programmes can be launched. 4.10.2 Health consequences and benets of intervention As several previous subsections have indicated, a deciency in one micronutri- ent can impair the utilization of another. Conversely, improving an individual'sstatus in one micronutrient, or even several micronutrients simultaneously in thecase of multiple deciencies, can have wider benets. For example, iron de-ciency may cause vitamin A to be trapped in the liver; several studies have shownthat iron supplementation alone can increase serum retinol concentrationsmarkedly ( 85). Goitre is more resistant to improvement by iodine supplemen- tation in the presence of iron deciency, and iron supplementation of decientchildren improves their rate of goitre response to iodine supplements or iodinefortied salt ( 87). Similarly, the addition of vitamin A to iron supplements4. ZINC, B VITAMINS, VITAMINS C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 91increases blood haemoglobin by a substantial amount in vitamin A-depleted, anaemic populations ( 99) and can help to further increase iron stores ( 223). Deciencies of vitamin B 12,folate, vitamin B 2(riboflavin) and several other micronutrients can also contribute to anaemia ( 77). As vitamin C (from foods or added as a forticant) improves the absorption of non-haem iron from food and many iron forticants, it too is frequently added as well as iron as aforticant. In the past, interventions have targeted deciencies in iron, vitamin A and iodine, in part because these can be detected more easily and more is knownabout their adverse effects. Typically, separate programmes were developed foreach nutrient. In more recent years, it has become increasingly apparent thatthere are many reasons why multiple micronutrient fortication may be moreappropriate and should be considered. In addition to treating and preventingiron, vitamin A and iodine deciencies, fortication affords a good opportunityto control other micronutrient deciencies that are likely to coexist in many populations.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 92PARTIII Forticants: physical characteristics, selection and use with specic food vehiclesIntroduction By providing a critical review of the forticants that are currently available for fortication purposes, Part III of these guidelines is intended to assist pro-gramme managers in their choice of rstly, a suitable food vehicle and secondly, a compatible forticant. Having established - through the application of appro-priate criteria - that the nature of the public health risk posed by a micronutri-ent deciency justies intervention in the form of food fortication, the selectionof a suitable combination of food vehicle and forticant(s), or more specically,the chemical form of the micronutrient(s) that will added to the chosen foodvehicle, is fundamental to any food fortication programme. Subsequent chap- ters (Part IV) cover other important aspects of food fortication programmeplanning, including how to calculate how much forticant to add to the chosenfood vehicle in order to achieve a predetermined public health benet (Chapter7), monitoring and impact evaluation (Chapters 8 and 9), marketing (Chapter10) and regulatory issues (Chapter 11). In practice, the selection of a food vehicle-forticant combination is governed byrange of factors, both technological and regulatory. Foods such as cereals, oils, dairy products, beverages and various condiments such as salt, sauces (e.g.soy sauce) and sugar are particularly well suited to mandatory mass fortica-tion. These foods share some or all of the following characteristics: They are consumed by a large proportion of the population, including (or especially) the population groups at greatest risk of deciency. They are consumed on a regular basis, in adequate and relatively consistent amounts. They can be centrally processed (central processing is preferable for a number of reasons, but primarily because the fewer the number of locationswhere forticants are added, the easier it is to implement quality control meas-ures; monitoring and enforcement procedures are also likely to be more effec-tive). Allow a nutrient premix to be added relatively easily using low-cost technol- ogy, and in such a way so as to ensure an even distribution within batches of the product. 95Are used relatively soon after production and purchase. Foods that are pur- chased and used within a short period of time of processing tend to havebetter vitamin retention, and fewer sensorial changes due to the need for only a small overage 1. The choice of forticant compound is often a compromise between reasonable cost, bioavailability from the diet, and the acceptance of any sensory changes.When selecting the most appropriate chemical form of a given micronutrient,the main considerations and concerns are thus: Sensory problems .Forticants must not cause unacceptable sensory problems (e.g. colour, flavour, odour or texture) at the level of intended fortication,or segregate out from the food matrix, and they must be stable within givenlimits. If additional packaging is needed to improve stability of the added for-ticant, it is helpful if this does not add signicantly to the cost of the productand make it unaffordable to the consumer. Interactions .The likelihood or potential for interactions between the added micronutrient and the food vehicle, and with other nutrients (either added ornaturally present), in particular any interactions that might interfere with themetabolic utilization of the forticant, needs to be assessed and checked priorto the implementation of a fortication programme. Cost.The cost of fortication must not affect the affordability of the food nor its competitivity with the unfortied alternative. Bioavailability .The forticant must be sufciently well absorbed from the food vehicle and be able to improve the micronutrient status of the targetpopulation. Safety is also an important consideration. The level of consumption that is required for fortication to be effective must be compatible with a healthy diet. The following two chapters consider the above factors in relation to specic micronutrients or micronutrient groups. Chapter 5 deals with iron, vitamin Aand iodine; Chapter 6 covers some of the other micronutrients (such as zinc,folate and the other B vitamins, vitamin D and calcium) for which the severityof the public health problem of deciencies is less well known but is believed tobe signicant. The discussion is limited to those forticants and food vehiclesthat currently are the most widely used, or that have potential for wider appli-cation. Details of publications and articles containing more in-depth informa-tion about the fortication of foods with specic nutrients are provided in theattached further reading list.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 961Overage is the term used to describe the extra amount of micronutrient that is added to a food vehicle to compensate for losses during production, storage, distribution and selling.CHAPTER 5 Iron, vitamin A and iodine 5.1 Iron 5.1.1 Choice of iron forticant Technically, iron is the most challenging micronutrient to add to foods, because the iron compounds that have the best bioavailability tend to be those that inter-act most strongly with food constituents to produce undesirable organolepticchanges. When selecting a suitable iron compound as a food forticant, theoverall objective is to nd the one that has the greatest absorbability, i.e. the highest relative bioavailability 1(RBV) compared with ferrous sulfate, yet at the same time does not cause unacceptable changes to the sensory properties(i.e. taste, colour, texture) of the food vehicle. Cost is usually another importantconsideration. A wide variety of iron compounds are currently used as food forticants (Table 5.1 ). These can be broadly ) and poorly soluble in dilute acid. 5.1.1.1 Water-soluble compounds Being highly soluble in gastric juices, the water-soluble iron compounds have the highest relative bioavailabilities of all the iron forticants and for this reasonare, more often than not, the preferred choice. However, these compounds arealso the most likely to have adverse effects on the organoleptic qualities of foods,in particular, on the colour and flavour. During prolonged storage, the presenceof forticant iron in certain foods can cause rancidity and subsequent off-flavours. Moreover, in the case of multiple fortication, free iron, produced fromthe degradation of iron compounds present in the food, can oxidize some of thevitamins supplied in the same forticant mixture. 971Relative bioavailability is a measure which scores the absorbability of a nutrient by comparing its absorbability to that of a reference nutrient that is considered as having the most efcientabsorbability.The water-soluble forms of iron are especially suited to fortifying cereal flours that have a relatively fast turnover, i.e. one month in warm, humid climates andup to 3 months in dry, cold climates. Water-soluble iron compounds are alsouseful for dry foods, such as pasta and milk powder, as well as dried milk-basedinfant formulas. Encapsulated forms, i.e. iron compounds that have been coatedGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 98TABLE 5.1 Key characteristics of iron compounds commonly used for food fortication purpose: solubility, bioavailability and cost Compound Iron content Relative bioavailabilityaRelative costb (%) (per mg iron) Water soluble Ferrous sulfate. 7H 202 0 100 1.0 Ferrous sulfate, dried 33 100 1.0Ferrous gluconate 12 89 >100 c16.7 Poorly water soluble, soluble in dilute acid Ferrous fumarate 33 100 2.2 Ferrous succinate 33 92 9.7Ferric saccharate 10 74 8.1 Water insoluble, (24) 75 0.8Carbonyl 99 5-20 2.2 Encapsulated forms Ferrous sulfate 16 100 100 17.4 EDTA, ethylenediamineteraacetate; H-reduced, hydrogen reduced; hydrated ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4.7H 2O), in adult humans.

Per mg of iron, the cost of hydrated and dry ferrous sulfateis similar. cAbsorption is two-three times better than that from ferrous sulfate if the phytate content offood vehicle is high. dThe high value refers to a very small particle size which has only been used in experimentalstudies. Sources: adapted from references ( 224-226 ), with additional data supplied by P. Lohmann (cost data) and T. Walczky (ferrous lactate, H-reduced elemental iron).to physically separate the iron from the other food components, can be used for slowing down or preventing sensory changes. Ferrous sulfate is by far the most frequently used water-soluble iron forti- cant, principally because it is the cheapest. It has been widely used to fortifyflour (see section 5.1.5.1 ). However, depending on its physical characteristics, the climate and the fat content of the flour to which it is added, ferrous sulfatecan cause rancidity, and therefore its suitability as a forticant needs to be eval-uated in trials before use. 5.1.1.2 Iron compounds that are poorly soluble in water but soluble in dilute acid Compounds that fall into the second category of iron forticants (see Table 5.1 ) are also reasonably well absorbed from food, as they are soluble in the gastricacids produced in the stomach of normal healthy adults and adolescents. Someconcern has been raised about absorption in infants who may secrete less acidbut further research is needed in this area before any rm conclusions can be drawn. In most people, however, with the possible exception of individuals whosuffer from a lack of gastric acid due to medical problems, iron absorption fromthese compounds is likely to be similar to that from water-soluble iron com-pounds. Poorly water-soluble iron compounds, such as ferrous fumarate, havethe advantage of causing fewer sensory problems in foods than the water-solublecompounds, and are generally next in line for consideration, especially if morewater-soluble forms cause unacceptable organoleptic changes in the chosen food vehicle. Ferrous fumarate and ferric saccharate are the most commonly used iron compounds in this group, and in adults are as bioavailable as ferrous sulfate.The former is frequently used to fortify infant cereals and the latter, chocolatedrink powders. Ferrous fumarate is used to fortify maize flour in Venezuela andwheat flour in Central America, where it has also been proposed as a potentialforticant for maize masa. Ferrous fumarate can be used in an encapsulatedform to limit sensory changes. 5.1.1.3 Iron compounds that are insoluble in water and poorly soluble in dilute acid Relative to ferrous sulfate, the absorption of iron from water-insoluble com- pounds ranges from approximately 20% up to 75%. Despite their reducedabsorbability, water-insoluble iron compounds have been widely used by thefood industry as forticants because they have far less effect on the sensoryproperties of foods (at the levels currently used) and because they are cheaperthan the more soluble compounds. However, they are generally regarded as thelast resort option, especially in settings where the diet of the target population5. IRON, VITAMIN A AND IODINE 99is high in iron absorption inhibitors. If it is necessary to use a water-insoluble iron forticant, it should ideally have an absorption equivalent to at least 50%that of ferrous sulfate (as measured in rat or human assays), and twice as much would need to be added in order to compensate for the reduced absorption rate. Within this category of iron forticants, the ferric phosphate compounds - ferric orthophosphate and ferric pyrophosphate - are used to fortify rice, andsome infant cereals and chocolate-containing foods. They have a modest ironbioavailability: the relative bioavailability of ferric pyrophosphate is reported to be 21-74%, and that of orthophosphate, 25-32%. However, the relativebioavailability of the ferric during the processing of afood ( 227,228 ). Elemental iron powders are used in a number of countries to fortify cereals, but the bioavailabilities of the different forms of elemental iron that are currently available ( Table 5.1 ) are not well established ( 229). The solubility of elemental iron is very dependent on the size, shape and surface area of the iron particles(characteristics which are governed by the manufacturing process 1), as well as the composition of the meals in which it is consumed. According to the conclusions of the Sharing United States T echnology to Aid Improvement of Nutrition (SUSTAIN) T ask Force, only electrolytic ironpowders (diameter <45 microns or 325 mesh) have been proven to be suf- ciently bioavailable to humans ( 229). At the time of the meeting of the T ask Force, the only electrolytic iron powders to have been tested were those manu- factured by OMG Americas under the trade name \"Glidden 131\" 2.More recent data indicate that carbonyl iron and some hydrogen-reduced (H-reduced) ironpowders have electrolytic iron. Atomized andcarbon monoxide-reduced (CO-reduced) iron are not recommended at thepresent time because of their lower bioavailability. (Atomized iron is a reduced-iron powder that has been processed by striking a stream of molten iron withhigh-pressure water jets.) Elemental iron with a large particle size (diameter>149 microns or 100 mesh) is probably too insoluble in the intestine and is therefore not generally recommended for use as a food forticant. Furthertesting of the bioavailability of various elemental iron powders is ongoing ( 42). 5.1.2 Methods used to increase the amount of iron absorbed from forticants The bioavailability of iron from forticants is dependent not only on the solu- bility of the forticant as discussed above, but also on the composition of theGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 1001For more details, please refer to the Handbook of powder metal technologies and applications (230). 2At the time of writing, Glidden 131 was still available.diet, in particular, on the proportion of inhibitors of iron absorption in the diet, notably iron-binding phytates and certain phenolic compounds. The addition ofascorbic acid (vitamin C) or sodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (sodium EDTA or Na 2EDTA) and the removal of phytates, all of which reduce the effect of the inhibitors, can be effective ways of increasing the total amount of ironabsorbed from iron-fortied foods. 5.1.2.1 Ascorbic acid The addition of ascorbic acid causes a substantial increase in the amount of ironabsorbed from most iron compounds ( 40,224 ). Ascorbic acid addition to iron- fortied foods is thus a widely adopted practice throughout the food industry,especially for processed foods. This option is, however, not recommended forstaples and condiments because of stability issues (see section 5.1.5.1 ). For example, Chile forties milk powder delivered through its public health pro-gramme with both iron and ascorbic acid (as well as some other micronutrients) to control anaemia in infants and young children. In most studies, the co-addition of ascorbic acid and iron in a 2:1 molar ratio (6:1 weight ratio) increased iron absorption from foods 2- to 3-fold in adultsand children ( 224). This ratio of ascorbic acid to iron is thus recommended for most foods; a higher ascorbic acid:iron molar ratio (4:1) can be used for high-phytate foods. The main problem with using ascorbic acid as a food additive is that substantial amounts can be lost during food storage and preparation.This means that, relative to some of the alternatives, it can be an expensiveoption. 5.1.2.2 Sodium EDTA Sodium EDTA is a permitted food additive in many countries, and unlike ascor-bic acid, is stable during processing and storage. At low pH (i.e. in the stomach),sodium EDTA acts as a chelating agent, and as such prevents iron from bindingto phytic acid or phenolic compounds, which would otherwise inhibit ironabsorption ( 231). Its addition enhances the absorption of both food iron and soluble iron forticants ( 232), but not that of the relatively insoluble iron com- pounds such as ferrous fumarate ( pyrophosphate ( 232) or elemen- ( 234). In the case of foods fortied with soluble iron compounds, such as ferrous sulfate, the addition of sodium EDTA in a molar ratio of Na 2EDTA:iron of between 0.5 and 1.0 (between 3.3:1 and 6.6:1 weight ratio) is recommended.Under these circumstances iron absorption is increased by up to 2-3 times(224).5. IRON, VITAMIN A AND IODINE 1015.1.2.3 Dephytinize cereals and legumes The phytic acid content of cereals, pulses and legumes can be substantially reduced by several methods ( 224), some of which are particularly suitable for ensuring adequate iron absorption from cereal-based complementary foods orsoy-based infant formulas. However, the molar ratio of phytic acid:iron needsto be decreased to at least 1:1, or even to less than 0.5:1, in order to achieve ameaningful increase in iron absorption. Milling removes about 90% of the phytic acid from cereal grains, but the remaining 10% is still strongly inhibitory. The action of phytases (enzymes) isusually necessary in order to achieve complete phytate degradation. Naturally-occurring cereal phytases can be activated by traditional processes, such assoaking, germination and fermentation. At the industrial level, it is possible tocompletely degrade phytic acid in complementary food mixtures of cereals andlegumes by adding exogenous phytases or by adding whole wheat or whole rye as a source of phytases, these being naturally high in phytases ( 224,235-237 ). Because of the risk of bacterial contamination, it is better to add the phytasesunder factory conditions, but as yet, this practice has not been adopted commercially. 5.1.3 Novel iron forticants In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted to the development and testing of alternative iron forticants, in particular, forticants that provide betterprotection against iron absorption inhibitors than those currently available.Among those at an experimental stage are sodium iron EDTA (NaFeEDTA),ferrous bisglycinate and various encapsulated and micronized iron compounds.In recent years, NaFeEDTA has been selected as the iron compound to fortifygovernment-led soy sauce fortication and wheat flour fortication programs inChina, and sh sauce fortication in Vietnam. 5.1.3.1 Sodium iron EDTA In high-phytate foods, the absorption of iron from NaFeEDTA is 2-3 timesgreater than that from either ferrous sulfate or ferrous fumarate. In foods with a low phytate content, however, iron absorption is similar ( 231,232 ). In addi- NaFeEDTA offersa number of other advantages: it does not promote lipid oxidation in storedcereals, or the formation of precipitates in foods that are high in free peptides,such as soy sauce and sh sauce. On the down side, it is expensive, and becauseit is slowly soluble in water, it may cause colour changes in some foods. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives has approved the use of NaFeEDTA at 0.2mgFe/kg body weight per day ( 238). Neverthe- less, the use of Na 2EDTA plus ferrous sulfate (or possibly other soluble ironGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 102compounds) rather than NaFeEDTA might yet prove to be the better option for high-phytate foods. In most settings, the choice will depend on the relativecosts of, and accessibility to, the EDTA compounds, the acceptability of sensory changes in the food, and current legislation. 5.1.3.2 Ferrous bisglycinate Ferrous bisglycinate is an iron-amino acid chelate in which the iron is protected from the action of absorption inhibitors by being bound to the amino acid,glycine. Absorption from this form of iron has been reported to be 2-3 timesbetter than that from ferrous sulfate in a high-phytate cereal and in whole maize.In contrast, a closely-related compound, trisglycinate, maize ( 239,240 ). Ferrous bisglycinate seems to be particularly well suited to the fortication of liquid whole milk and other dairy products where use of ferrous sulfate leads torancid off-flavours. However, ferrous bisglycinate can also cause rancidity byoxidizing fats in food, which can be a problem in cereal flours and weaning cereals unless an antioxidant is added as well. Furthermore, the bisglycinate ismuch more expensive than many other iron compounds. 5.1.3.3 Encapsulated ferrous sulfate and ferrous fumarate Several iron compounds are available commercially in encapsulated form,namely ferrous sulfate and ferrous fumarate, and are currently used in dry infantformulas and in infant cereals, predominantly in industrialized countries. Infuture, use of encapsulated forms of iron compounds may extend to develop-ing countries, although their cost may be a problem. Encapsulation increasescosts 3- to 5-fold, which when expressed in terms of iron amounts, is equiva-lent to a 10-fold increase in cost relative to the use of dried ferrous sulfate (Table 5.1 ). As previously indicated, the main purpose of encapsulation is to separate the iron from the other food components, thereby mitigating sensory changes. Indouble fortied salt (i.e. salt fortied with iodine and iron), encapsulation ofiron has been shown to help prevent iodine losses and to slow down colourchanges. When developing encapsulated iron forticants, it is important to select a coating that provides an adequate balance between stability and bioavailability.Iron compounds are usually encapsulated with hydrogenated vegetable oils, butmono- and diglycerides, maltodextrins and ethyl cellulose, have also been used.Because of the different methods of manufacture, and because different capsulematerials and thicknesses are possible, it is imperative to conrm bioavailability,atleast in rat assays, before widespread use as a forticant. T ests have shown that encapsulation of ferrous sulfate and ferrous fumarate does not alter iron5. IRON, VITAMIN A AND IODINE 103bioavailability to rats. In addition, dual fortication of salt with encapsulated iron has been found to be efcacious in humans (see section 1.3.2.3) ( 44). 5.1.3.4 Micronized ferric pyrophosphate Just as the bioavailability of elemental iron powders is increased by reducing their particle size, so too can that of insoluble iron salts, such as ferric pyrophos-phate. to an extremely small submicron parti-cle size cannot, however, be achieved by physical grinding, only by a chemicalprocess. A micronized form of ferric pyrophosphate (diameter, 0.5 microns) has been developed recently for use as a food forticant. It is available in both liquid anddried forms. In order to make it dispersible in liquids, the particles of ferricpyrophosphate are coated with emulsiers. Relative to ordinary ferric pyrophos- phate (mean particle size of around 8 microns), iron absorption by adult humansis improved by 2-4 four times in milk products ( 241). Its principal advantage is that, being insoluble in water, it is unlikely to cause many sensory problems,although this remains to be tested adequately. Currently it is added to liquid milkand yoghurt products in Japan, but its more widespread use in the foreseeablefuture is prohibited by its very high cost. 5.1.4 Sensory changes In the case of iron forticants, the two most common problems are increased rancidity due to oxidation of unsaturated lipids and unwanted colour changes.The latter typically include a green or bluish colouration in cereals, a greying ofchocolate and cocoa, and darkening of salt to yellow or red/brown. Sensory changes are highly variable and not always predictable. Just because an iron forticant does not cause adverse sensory changes to a food product inone situation, does not necessarily mean that the same forticant will not causea problem with the same food product in another situation.Thus, having selecteda potential iron forticant, it is essential that its effects on the sensory proper-ties of the food to which it is to be added are determined prior to use. 5.1.5 Experience with iron fortication of specic foods Iron fortication is already widely practised in many parts of the world. For example, more than 20 countries in Latin America have implemented mass ironfortication programmes, most of which involve the fortication of wheat ormaize flours ( 237). Elsewhere, other frequently used food vehicles include cereal-based complementary foods, sh sauce, soy sauce and milk. Salt has alsobeen fortied with iron in efcacy trials. Products derived from cereal flours(e.g. bread, cereal snacks and breakfast cereals) are also useful food vehicles, butthe amount of iron provided via this route will depend on the quantity of foodGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 104eaten and on the level of fortication. Iron compounds suitable for the forti- cation of specic food vehicles are listed in Table 5.2 . 5.1.5.1 Wheat flour The nutritional usefulness of iron fortication of wheat flour has recently been conrmed in an efcacy study in Thailand ( 242). In that study the relative 5.

Based on this evidence, adding double the amount of electrolyticiron or H-reduced iron as compared to ferrous sulfate, should give an equiva-lent efcacy to ferrous sulfate. Ferrous sulfate and elemental iron powders have traditionally been used to fortify wheat and other cereal flours. Electrolytic iron remains the preferred elemental iron forticant, however H-reduced iron could also be considered. Inaddition, recent evidence from rat studies suggests that carbonyl iron may be as good as electrolytic iron as a forticant, however human efcacy studies are stillnecessary to conrm this. Although ferrous sulfate has been successfully used for many years in Chile (where fortied flour is consumed within 6-8 weeks of purchase), and ferrousfumarate has been employed in Venezuela and throughout Central America, inother countries the addition of these iron compounds to wheat flours has causedrancidity. This problem could be overcome by using encapsulated forms toimprove stability. Ferrous sulfate, and to a lesser extent ferrous fumarate, arealso suitable forticants for pasta, which, because of its low moisture content, isless susceptible than wheat flour to the development of rancidity. Although potentially useful for some high-phytate flours, NaFeEDTA has not been used widely in any large-scale iron fortication programmes because ofreports that it interferes with the bread fermentation process ( 243). However, China is currently introducing NaFeEDTA to fortify wheat in several provinces,and so far there have been no recorded problems. Although ascorbic acid is oftenadded to iron-fortied foods in order to enhance absorption (see section 5.1.2.1 ), its usefulness in this respect in bread flours is limited by the fact that it isdestroyed by the action of heat during baking. Ascorbic acid is nevertheless fre-quently added to flours, not so much to enhance iron absorption, but rather asa raising agent. In its guidelines on iron fortication of cereal-based staples, the SUSTAIN Task Force ( 42) recommended the use of ferrous sulfate in preference, followed byferrous fumarate, and lastly electrolytic iron (but at twice the iron concen- tration of the other iron compounds). In order to ensure the successful forti-cation of wheat flour and wheat flour products, it may be necessary for individualcountries to adopt different strategies to take account of differences in climate,wheat flour quality, processing methods and storage conditions, as well as dif-ferences in the main uses of flour (i.e. to make bread or other foods). 5.1.5.2 Maize In general, maize flours are equally, if not more difcult, to fortify with iron thanwheat flours. Lime-treated (nixtamalized) corn masa, a staple used to make GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 106tortillas in much of Latin America, goes rancid when soluble iron compounds, such as ferrous sulfate, are added to it. Further colour and texture changes occurduring the preparation of tortillas. The difculties are further compounded by the fact that iron absorption from corn masa is strongly inhibited by its highphytate and high calcium content. For these reasons, iron fortication of maizeflours has not been widely adopted, except in a number of Latin American coun-tries where the consumption of maize is high. In Venezuela, for example, ferrousfumarate mixed with elemental iron is used to fortify maize flours. In view of its highly inhibitory nature (especially if it is not degermed), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) recently recommended the use of either NaFeEDTA or ferrous fumarate (at twice the amount) for maize flourfortication ( 237). These recommendations have yet to be put into practice. Whether or not they are appropriate for maize meal that is used to prepare por-ridge also needs to be evaluated. For maize flours that are not high in phytic acid (e.g. degermed) and are not lime-treated, the same iron compounds as thoserecommended for the fortication of white wheat flour can be considered ( 237). 5.1.5.3 Cereal-based complementary foods Complementary foods (i.e. foods intended for infants during the weaning period) are usually based on dry cereals and consumed as a porridge or gruelwith milk or water. Alternatively, they are based on blends of cereals andlegumes, which again can be made into a porridge or gruel with water.The addi-tion of ferrous sulfate, ferrous bisglycinate and other soluble iron compounds tothese products can cause rancidity, and sometimes colour changes as well, par-ticularly if the porridges are fed with fruits. T o overcome such problems, oneoption would be to use encapsulated forms, such as ferrous sulfate. Althoughencapsulation helps to prevent fat oxidation during storage, the capsule isremoved by hot milk or water, and off-colours may still develop in the presenceof some fruits and vegetables. Another option is to use a less soluble iron forticant, such as ferrous fumarate or electrolytic iron (but at a higher concentration), both of which arecommonly used to fortify complementary foods. Ferric pyrophosphate isanother possibility, although it is rarely used in practice. If ferric pyrophosphatewere to be used to fortify complementary foods, it too should be added at twice the concentration (relative to ferrous sulfate). Recent evidence has indicated thatferrous fumarate may be less well absorbed in children than in adults (absorp-tion of iron from ferrous fumarate by children may only be 25% of that by adults)and so its use as a forticant, or at least its level of addition, may need to be re-evaluated ( 244). In order to enhance iron absorption, ascorbic acid is usually added together with the iron compound to complementary foods whenever possible (see section5. IRON, VITAMIN A AND IODINE 1075.1.2.1 ). Ideally, ascorbic acid and iron should be added in at least a 2:1 molar ratio (ascorbic acid:iron). Dry complementary foods should also be packagedin such as way as to minimize ascorbic acid degradation during storage. As described above (see section 5.1.2.3 ), another useful way of optimizing iron absorption from cereal-based foods is to degrade any phytic acid present withnaturally-occurring cereal phytases (i.e. activate those already in the food bysoaking, germinating or fermenting) or by adding microbial phytases duringmanufacture. However, the addition of phytases to processed foods has yet tobe attempted on a commercial scale. 5.1.5.4 Dairy products Dried whole milk powders and dried or ready-to-feed milk-based infant for-mulas can be successfully fortied with ferrous sulfate (together with ascorbicacid to enhance absorption). In Chile, for example, ascorbic acid (700mg/kg)and iron (100mg as ferrous sulfate/kg) are routinely added to dried milkpowders consumed by infants. In the case of soy formulas, it has been foundnecessary to use ferrous sulfate encapsulated with maltodextrin in order toprevent unwanted colour changes (i.e. darkening). Ferrous sulfate, and many other soluble iron compounds, cannot be used to fortify liquid whole milk and other dairy products because they cause rancidityand off-flavours. Ferric are generally more suitable for this purpose.Iron forticants are best added after the milk has been homogenized and the fatinternalized in micelles, so as to help protect against oxidation. Ferrous bisgly-cinate is widely used to fortify whole milk and dairy products in Brazil and Italy;micronized ferric pyrophosphate is added to dairy products in Japan (see alsosection 5.1.3.4 ). 5.1.5.5 Rice The fortication of rice grains presents a number of technical challenges. It can be achieved, as is done in the United States, by coating the grain with an appro-priate formulation. Alternatively, a rice-based extruded grain that contains a high concentration of iron can be mixed with normal rice grains (usually at aratio of 1:200). Ferric pyrophosphate, added pyrophosphate (0.5 micron) have recently been recom-mended for adding to extruded articial rice grains ( 246). Technical difculties, combined with cultural preferences for specic types of rice, mean that mass fortication of rice, although desirable, remains problem- atic. The fact that in most of the big rice-producing countries, production takes place in thousands of small mills, also creates problems for mass rice fortica-tion. Not only are smaller mills sensitive to small increases in costs, the sheerGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 108number of them makes it difcult to maintain adequate quality control pro- grammes. Although the extruded grains have found some application in targeted food fortication programmes, such as school feeding programmes, much moreresearch and development is required before mass rice fortication programmescan be implemented on a wider scale. 5.1.5.6 Cocoa products As cocoa is naturally high in phenolic compounds, the addition of ferrous sulfateand other water-soluble iron compounds tends to cause colour changes in cocoa-based products ( 247). Ferrous fumarate is a useful alternative for some products, but grey or blue/grey colours are still a problem for chocolate drinks,especially if boiling water is used to make up the drink ( 227). Furthermore, the currently available encapsulated iron compounds are not useful for chocolatedrink fortication as the capsules are removed by heat either during productmanufacture or during preparation of the drink. Ferric pyrophosphate, ferric saccharate or ferric orthophosphate are usually used to fortify cocoa products as these tend to produce fewer off-colours.However, relative to ferrous sulfate, larger amounts of these iron compoundswould need to be added to allow for their lower absorption. Ascorbic acid addi- tion is also required (in at least a 2:1 molar ratio) in order to offset the inhibitoryeffects of cocoa phenolics on iron absorption ( 227,248 ). 5.1.5.7 Soy sauce and sh sauce Sodium iron EDTA has proved to be a useful forticant for both sh sauce and soy sauce (see also section 1.3.1 ). Studies have demonstrated that absorption of iron by human subjects fed NaFeEDTA-fortied sh or soy sauce added to ricemeals is similar to that from the same meals to which ferrous sulfate-fortiedsauces had been added ( 249). The iron status of iron-decient Vietnamese women improved signicantly following regular intakes of NaFeEDTA-fortied sh sauce over a period of 6 months ( 28) (see also section 1.3.1.1 ). Similarly, in trials conducted in China, NaFeEDTA soy sauce, providing 20mg iron per day,signicantly improved the iron status of anaemic adolescents ( 250). Large-scale effectiveness studies of soy sauce fortication with NaFeEDTA are currentlyunderway in both Viet Nam and China. Until very recently, NaFeEDTA has been the preferred iron forticant for soy and sh sauces because most of the potential alternatives (i.e. othersoluble iron compounds) cause peptide precipitation during storage. However,latterly ferrous sulfate stabilized with citric acid has been successfully used tofortify sh sauce in Thailand, and may offer a less expensive alternative toNaFeEDTA.5. IRON, VITAMIN A AND IODINE 1095.1.5.8 Salt The success of salt iodization programmes (see section 5.3.2.1 ) has led several countries to consider using salt as a vehicle for iron fortication. In practice, thismeans the double fortication of salt, i.e. with iron and iodine. Promisingapproaches that are already being tested include the addition of encapsulatedferrous fumarate, encapsulated ferrous sulfate (see section 1.3.2.3 ) or ferric pyrophosphate (at twice the concentration). Encapsulation is necessary as ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate and other soluble iron compounds very quicklycause a yellow or red/brown discoloration in the moist, low quality salt that iscurrently used in many developing countries. The main disadvantage of theencapsulation options is the increase in the price of the fortied product, whichcan be by as much as 30%. 5.1.6 Safety issues Concern has been raised about increased iron intakes, particularly in terms of the potential effects on infection rates and on the risk of cardiovascular diseaseand cancer. Much of this concern, however, relates to the use of pharmaceuti-cal iron supplements and not to fortied foods. A recent review of intervention studies with iron-fortied milk or cereals, con- cluded that iron fortication did not increase infectious morbidity in childrenunder 18 months of age ( 251). Studies in Chile ( 252), Hungary ( 253) and South Africa ( 254) reported that iron added to milk formula had no influence on infectious outcome. Only one study, conducted in a poor community in Chile,reported an increase in episodes of diarrhoea in young infants fed iron-fortiedformula ( 255). On balance, studies have indicated that iron fortication of milk formula is safe ( 251). It has been suggested that higher levels of iron intake and elevated body stores are potential risk factors for both coronary heart disease (CHD) and cancer.Results from studies carried out over the last 10 years to test this hypothesis are,however, inconclusive. The association between serum ferritin and risk of CHDhas been examined in at least 12 studies, but a meta-analysis of such evidencefailed to establish a strong relationship between the two ( 256). Inflammatory response is an important risk factor for CHD and also increases serum ferritin,which might explain why an association between the risk of CHD and increasedserum ferritin is sometimes observed. Possible links between cancer and iron intake or iron status have been the subject of only a few studies, but are largely unsubstantiated. It has been hypoth-esized that the presence of unabsorbed forticant iron in the body, much ofwhich reaches the colon, leads to free radical generation that damages the colonmucosa ( 257). However, iron is highly insoluble at the pH of the colon, and although unabsorbed ferrous sulfate can increase free radical generation in theGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 110stool ( 257), there is no evidence to suggest that the free radicals survive long enough to cause tissue damage. The nding that serum transferrin was higherin men who developed colon cancer ( 258) was not conrmed when the follow- up was extended to 17 years. Summary: iron fortication For most food vehicles, the recommended iron forticants, in order of preference, are: ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, encapsulated ferrous sulfate or fumarate, electrolytic iron (at twice the amount), and ferric pyrophosphate (at twice the amount). The co-addition of ascorbic acid in a 2:1 molar ratio is recommended in order to enhance iron absorption. This applies to infant foods and market-driven foods. Inthe case of high phytic acid foods, the molar ratio (ascorbic acid:iron) can be increased to 4:1. NaFeEDTA is recommended for the mass fortication of high-phytate cereal flours and for sauces with a high peptide content (e.g. sh sauce, soy sauce). For liquid milk products, ferrous bisglycinate, micronized ferric pyrophosphate and ferric ammonium citrate are appropriate forticants. 5.2 Vitamin A and -carotene 5.2.1 Choice of vitamin A forticant The choice of a vitamin A forticant is largely governed by the characteristics of the food vehicle, as well as various technological, regulatory and religious con-siderations. As preformed vitamin A (retinol) is an unstable compound, in com-mercial preparations it is esteried, usually with palmitic or acetic acid, to themore stable corresponding esters. Retinyl and retinyl palmitates, along with provitamin A ( -carotene), are thus the main commercial forms of vitamin A that are available for use as food forticants. The intense orange colour of - carotene makes it unsuitable for use as a forticant in many foods, but it is widelyused to give an orange-yellow colour to margarines and beverages. Since vitamin A is fat-soluble, it is easily added to fat-based or oily foods. When the food vehicle is either dry or a water-based liquid, an encapsulatedform of the vitamin is needed. Based on this distinction, vitamin A forticantscan be divided into two categories: Oily forms that can be incorporated directly into fat-based foods or emulsi- ed into water-based ones (e.g. milk). Dryforms that can be dry mixed into foods or dispersed in water, depend- ing on whether they are cold water dispersible or non-cold water dispersible.5. IRON, VITAMIN A AND IODINE 111Pure vitamin A and -carotene in solution are unstable when exposed to ultra- violet light, oxygen or air. Thus all forms of vitamin A - oily or dried - are pro- tected with antioxidants to prolong their shelf-life. The use of airtight packagingprovides further protection. For example, the loss of vitamin A in sealed cansof oil is minimal, but losses from fortied cereals, fortied sugar or oil can beas high as 40%, depending on ambient conditions and storage times ( 259-261 ). Opaque packaging is indispensable for maintaining stability in vitamin A-fortied oils. The characteristics and applications of the various forms of vitamin A are listed in Table 5.3 .Each formulation includes stabilizers, and each is compati- ble with existing food regulations (e.g. contain permitted antioxidants) and/orreligious requirements (e.g. Kosher, Halal). The fat-soluble forms of retinol areabout one half to one third as expensive as the dry forms. Appropriate vitaminA forticants for specic foods are given in Table 5.4 . 5.2.2 Experience with vitamin A fortication of specic foods Of the food vehicles suitable for mass fortication, margarine is the one that is most frequently associated with vitamin A.

In parts of Central America, sugar is often the preferred food vehicle for vitamin A. The amount and forms of vitamin A used in a selection of food for-tication programmes are detailed in Table 5.5 .It is estimated that about 90% of forticant vitamin A will usually be absorbed ( 262). 5.2.2.1 Oils and margarine There are two reasons why margarines and oils are the ideal foods for vitamin A fortication. Not only is the oil-soluble form of the vitamin the cheapest avail-able, but the oil protects the vitamin A from oxidation during storage and sofacilitates absorption of the vitamin ( 264). The vitamin A fortication of mar- garines has a relatively long history, having been introduced in some countriesas early as the 1920s, following the realization that the replacement of butterwith margarine in the diet was causing widespread xerophthalmia in children (265). Vitamin A fortication of margarine in Newfoundland, Canada, for example, resulted in a marked improvement in vitamin A status ( 266). Likewise, in India, a hydrogenated oil (vanaspati), which is used as an alternative to ghee,has been fortied with vitamin A since 1953 ( 267). Although the technology for adding vitamin A to oils is simple and inexpen- sive, and oils are widely used, the fortication of oils with this vitamin is rela-tively rare, at least compared with that of margarines. The fortication of oils isthus a potentially useful means of expanding the present range of vitamin A-fortied foods. Stability may be a problem in some settings; experimental studieshave shown that when vitamin A is added to soybean oil in sealed cans, the5.

Source: adapted from reference (263).vitamin was stable for up to 9 months. However, although less than 15% of the vitamin A was lost during boiling or pressure cooking of rice or beans, about60% was lost when the oil was reused several times for frying ( 260). There has been little systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of margarine and oil fortication, although historical data from Europe suggest that it hasbeen effective in controlling vitamin A deciency. In the Philippines, consump-tion of \"Star margarine\", with 25mg vitamin reduced the prevalence of low serum retinol. PL-480 vegetable oil, which is distributed in emergency feeding programmes, is intended to provide about 50% of the recommended daily intake of vitamin A for an adultmale (assuming a daily intake of 16g per person) (see Table 5.5 ). The stability of vitamin A in previously unopened pails of PL-480 oil is excellent, althoughup to 30% losses can occur in opened pails after 30 days of storage. Vitamin Aretention in the oil is also good, with only a 10% loss after 30 minutes of heating(268). 5.2.2.2 Cereals products and flours Wholegrain cereals and flours contain negligible, if any, amounts of intrinsic vitamin A. Flours are, nevertheless, potentially good vehicles for vitamin A fortication, because dry forms of vitamin A can easily be mixed in with otheradditives. Despite this, cereal flours are not fortied with vitamin A in mostindustrialized countries, because, for historical reasons, margarines are the preferred vehicle and, furthermore, because vitamin A deciency is no longer asignicant problem. The United States Title II Food Aid Program has been fortifying wheat-soy and corn-soy blends with vitamin A for about 30 years;working on the assumption that the recipients are likely to be highly dependent on these fortied foods for their vitamin A needs, it adds sufcient amounts toprovide 100% of the recommended daily intake of this particular vitamin ( 269). However, between 30% and 50% of the vitamin A that is added to the blendedcereals is lost in shipping and storage ( 268,270 ). Wheat flour is fortied with 4.5mg retinol/kg in some mills in the Philippines, a practice which provides an average concentration in bread of 2.2 \u00b5g retinol/g (Table 5.5 ). This supplies about 33% of the recommended daily intake for vitamin A for school-age children. At this level of fortication, retinol liver storesin decient children were signicantly increased at the end of a 30-week ef-cacy trial ( 33) (see also section 1.3.1.2 ). Pre-cooked maize flour has been fortied with vitamin A in Venezuela since 1993 ( Table 5.5 ). A fortication level of 2.7mg/kg and an intake of 80g flour/day supplies about 40% of an average family's recommended intake ( 271). However, the impact of maize fortication on the vitamin A status of the generalpopulation is not known.5. IRON, VITAMIN A AND IODINE 1155.2.2.3 Sugar In the 1970s, vitamin A fortication of sugar was implemented in Costa Rica and Guatemala, because it was the only centrally processed food vehicle thatwas consumed in adequate amounts by the poorer segments of the population. Such programmes ceased for a time during the 1980s but are again function-ing Guatemala, and also in El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua where theyreceive strong support from the sugar industry ( 272). An early evaluation of vitamin A fortication of sugar in Guatemala showed that it is an effective strat-egy for improving vitamin A status and for increasing the amount of the vitaminin breast milk of lactating mothers ( 273) (see also section 1.3.2.4 ). Fortied sugar in Guatemala provides children with about one third of their recommendedintake of vitamin A ( 274) (Table 5.5 ). Sugar fortication is now being imple- mented in other parts of the world, such as Zambia. Large quantities of sugar are used in a wide range of commercial foods, such as confectionery and soft drinks. Retinol in fortied unrened sugar survives the baking process but is lost during soft-drink production (in fortied unrenedsugar only one third of the initial level remains after 2 weeks of storage).Depending on the level of soft drink production, these losses can have impor-tant cost implications and it may be appropriate for the soft drink sector to beexempt from having to use fortied sugar ( 275). 5.2.2.4 Rice Given that rice is an important staple in many countries where the prevalence of vitamin A deciency is high, vitamin A fortication of rice has the potentialto be an effective public health strategy for the elimination of VAD. However, asis the case with iron, for technical reasons, rice fortication with vitamin A isstill at an experimental stage. Again, the predominance of small-scale mills inthe rice-producing countries hinders the implementation of fortication pro-grammes using rice as the chosen food vehicle. 5.2.2.5 Other foods and beverages Other foods that have been fortied successfully with preformed or provitamin A include: \u2014drymilk; \u2014complementary foods for infants and young children; \u2014biscuits and beverages, which are sold commercially or used in school feeding programmes such as those implemented in Indonesia, Mexico andother countries in Central America ( 276), (277), Peru ( 278) and South Africa ( 34);GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 116\u2014instant noodles (in Thailand), the vitamin A (and elemental iron1) being supplied in the spices that are provided in a separate sachet ( 279); \u2014yoghurt (worldwide) ( 280). 5.2.3 Safety issues Adverse physiological effects have been associated with both acute hypervita- minosis A and chronic high intake. The routine consumption of large amountsof vitamin A over a period of time can result in a variety of toxic symptomsincluding liver damage, bone abnomalities and joint pain, alopecia, headaches,vomiting and skin desquamation ( 93). For long-term daily intakes, the United States Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board (IOM/FNB) have dened T olerable Upper Intake Levels(ULs) for vitamin A, as follows ( 91): \u2014600\u00b5g/day for children <3 years, \u2014900\u00b5g/day for \u20141 700\u00b5g/day \u20142 800\u00b5g/day for adolescents, \u20143 000\u00b5g/day for both women at risk of becoming pregnant and adult men. The UL for children, i.e. the highest level of daily vitamin A intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse health effects, is a factor of 10 lower than the level ofintake at which any toxic effect has been observed in this age group. The ULs as dened by the United States Food and Nutrition Board are based on data obtained from healthy populations in developed countries. They maynot apply, nor are intended to do so, to communities of malnourished individ-uals that receive vitamin A prophylactically, either periodically or through forti-cation, as a means of preventing vitamin A deciency. A recent review hasindicated that the risk of excessive vitamin A consumption from fortied foodsin women and young children is likely to be negligible ( 281), but that it is nev- ertheless a matter that deserves attention as many foods are increasingly beingfortied with vitamin A. -Carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids are less of a concern in terms of potential toxicity, not being active forms of the vitamin and because at highdoses they are absorbed less efciently ( 91). Furthermore, the synthesis of vitamin A from -carotene and other provitamin A carotenoids is strictly regu- lated in the body. Hypervitaminosis A has never been reported as a result ofprovitamin A supplementation.5. IRON, VITAMIN A AND IODINE 1171Elemental iron is used because more soluble iron compounds would give the spices a black colour.5.3 Iodine 5.3.1 Choice of iodine forticant There are two chemical forms of iodine that are suitable for use as food fortif- icants, namely, iodate and iodide. They are usually added as the potassium salt,but sometimes as the calcium or sodium salt ( Table 5.6 ). Potassium iodide has been used as an additive in bread and salt for about 80 years, and potassium iodate for about 50 years. Iodates are less soluble in water than the iodides, more resistant to oxidation and evaporation, and being morestable under adverse climatic conditions, do not require the co-addition of sta-bilizers. Although more expensive, potassium iodate is thus preferred to potas-sium iodide, especially in hot and humid climates, and is recommended as an additive for many foods, including salt ( 282,283 ). For historical reasons, however, countries in Europe and North America still use potassium iodide,while most countries with tropical climates use potassium iodate. Losses ofGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 118TABLE 5.6 Iodine forticants: chemical composition and iodine content Forticant Formula Iodine content (%) Calcium iodide CaI vitamin A fortication A variety of oily and dry forms of the retinol esters, retinyl acetate and retinyl palmi- tate, are available for food fortication purposes. The dry forms are usually gelatin- , starch- or gum-coated and all forms contain antioxidants. Absorption of all forms is good (around 90%) but losses of vitamin A during pro- cessing, storage and food preparation may be high. Vitamin A fortication of margarine and sugar has been shown to be efcacious. Vegetable oils and cereal flours are also considered to be useful fortication vehi- cles. Adverse health effects have been associated with acute and chronic high intakes of retinol (mainly through supplementation) but not with high intakes of the pro- vitamin A carotenoids.iodine because of iodide oxidation are increased by moisture, humidity, expo- sure to heat and sunlight, or by impurities in the salt to which it is added. 5.3.2 Experience with iodine fortication of specic foods 5.3.2.1 Salt Salt is the most widely used food vehicle for iodine forticants. Indeed, univer- sal salt iodization (USI), that is, the iodization of all salt for human (food indus-try and household) and livestock consumption, is the strategy recommended byWHO for the control of iodine deciency disorders ( 284). The choice of this strategy is based on the following factors: \u2014salt is one of the few commodities consumed by everyone; \u2014salt consumption is fairly stable throughout the year; \u2014salt production is usually limited to a few geographical areas; \u2014salt iodization technology is easy to implement and available at reasonable cost throughout the developing world (0.2-0.3US cents/kg, or 1US centper person/year); \u2014the addition of iodine to salt does not affect its colour, taste or odour; \u2014the quality of iodized salt can be monitored at the production, retail and household levels. The mining of solid rock deposits is the main source of salt in Australia, Europe and North America. Elsewhere, i.e. in Africa, Asia and South America, solarevaporation of either sea water, lake or underground brines is the main source.After extraction, crude salt is rened so that its purity increases from 85-95%NaCl to 99% NaCl. Specications for the physical characteristics and chemicalcomposition required for food grade salt are laid down in the Codex Alimentarius ( 285). Iodine is usually added to salt after the salt has been rened and dried, by one of two main techniques. In the wet method, a solution of potassium iodate(KIO 3) is either dripped or sprayed at a uniform rate onto salt passing by on a conveyor belt. The technique is particularly cost-effective. For instance, inSwitzerland, a single conveyor belt and sprayer produces enough salt for 6million people at a cost of 1US$ per 100kg salt or 7US cents per person peryear ( 286). The alternative method, the dry method, involves sprinkling potas- sium iodide powder (KI) or potassium iodate (KIO 3) over the dry salt. This technique is more demanding, in that it requires a salt made of small homoge-nous crystals and the thorough mixing of the salt after addition of the iodinecompound to ensure an even distribution of iodine. Poor mixing is a major cause5. IRON, VITAMIN A AND IODINE 119of inappropriate salt iodization. T echnical information on the salt iodization process is available elsewhere ( 287). The stability of iodine in salt depends on the water content, acidity and purity of the salt to which it is added. In order to reduce iodine losses during storage,the iodized salt must be as pure and as dry as possible, and it must be appro-priately packaged. Iodine tends to migrate from the top to the bottom of a con-tainer when the water content is too high. It will evaporate if the acidity is toohigh. Losses also tend to occur when packaging with impervious linings is used;as the packaging becomes damp, the iodide migrates from the salt to the fabric, and then evaporates. This is less likely to happen with potassium iodate becausethe iodates are less soluble and more resistant to oxidation. Types of packagingthat help to prevent iodine losses include high density polyethylene bags that are either laminated with low density polyethylene or lined with a continuous lmthat is resistant to puncture. In a multi-country study of iodine losses from salt,high humidity combined with porous packing (such as jute bags), caused a30-80% loss of iodine over a period of 6 months ( 288). Because salt iodization is cheap and easy to implement, great strides in salt iodization programmes have been made in a relatively short period of time(Table 5.7 ). During the 10-year period, 1989 to 1999, the proportion of house- holds consuming iodized salt increased from 10% to 68% and by 1999, of 130countries affected by iodine deciency, 98 had in place legislation requiring theiodization of salt ( 284). Several factors have limited progress towards the goal of USI; these include difculties in enforcing legislation on iodized salt; prob-lems caused by having a high number of small-scale salt producers and theabsence of an operational monitoring system. The existence of pockets of pop-ulations living in remote areas that cannot easily access iodized salt is anotherfactor which can hinder the effective implementation of salt iodization pro-grammes and their sustainability in some countries. In order to assist countriesGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 120TABLE 5.7 Progress towards universal salt iodization in WHO regions, status as of 1999 WHO region Coverage (% of households) No. of countries with legislation on iodized salt Africa 63 34 Americas 90 17South-East Asia 70 7Europe 27 20Eastern Mediterranean 66 14Western Pacic 76 6 Total 68 98 Sources: adapted from references ( 284,289 ).develop and sustain effective salt iodization programmes, several international organizations, including WHO, have jointly established a mechanism forstrengthening national capacity in activities that support salt iodization, in par- ticular, quality assurance and monitoring. The work of the InternationalResource Laboratory for Iodine network (IRLI), which includes training and technology transfer and information sharing, is outlined in more detail inAnnex B . 5.3.2.2 Bread From a technical point of view, bread is a good vehicle for iodine and has been shown to be an effective way of ensuring a constant supply of dietary iodine. Ithas been used in a few European countries where bread is a staple food, suchas Russia ( 290,291 ), and in T asmania.The main carrier for iodine in the Nether- lands is the salt added to bread, i.e. baker's salt, which has been enriched withiodine since 1942. In recent years, the potassium iodide content of Dutch baker'ssalt has been increased. 5.3.2.3 Water Because water is consumed daily, it too has the potential to be a useful vehiclefor iodine fortication. Its major limitation, compared with salt, is that sourcesof drinking water are so numerous and ubiquitous that iodization would be dif-cult to control. Moreover, iodine has limited stability in water (no longer than24 hours) such that continuous daily dosing of the water supply would be nec-essary. Although the use of water as a vehicle for iodine fortication is techni-cally more difcult than the use of salt, there are certain conditions where wateriodization could be a suitable method for the correction of iodine deciency. The simplest way of fortifying water with iodine is to add a concentrated iodine solution (as potassium iodide or iodate) in a dropwise fashion until aspecied concentration in the water contained in a given vessel is reached. Thismethod is widely used in schools in northern Thailand ( 292). Alternatively, in the case of hand pumps and open wells, iodine in porous polymer containerscan be introduced into the water supply. The porous containers allow the slowrelease of potassium iodide solution into the water supply. However, such con-tainers have a limited shelf-life and must be changed every year. Such practiceshave been successful in several parts of the world; in Africa, in the CentralAfrican Republic, Mali ( 293) and Sudan ( 294), in Asia, in the central Asian republics, Malaysia ( 295) and Thailand and in Europe, in Italy (Sicily). In most settings, the limiting factor, especially in terms of cost-effectiveness, is that thewhole population and the livestock need to use the iodized water supply pointto benet from iodization ( 296). A third option, which is suitable for piped water supplies, is to divert some of the piped water through a canister packed with5. IRON, VITAMIN A AND IODINE 121iodine crystals, and then reintroduce this iodized water back into the main water supply. The direct addition of an iodine solution to freshwater supplies has alsobeen attempted. For instance, a 5% potassium iodate solution was introduced into the single river which supplied water to an isolated population in China fora period of 12-24 days ( 297). The result was an improvement in urinary iodine of children, and a relatively stable increase in soil iodine. A review of the efcacy and cost-effectiveness of the different procedures used to iodize water concluded that while efcacious for the most part, there isno doubt that the cost, and the monitoring systems needed, are more problem- atic than those required for iodized salt ( 296). 5.3.2.4 Milk Iodine-enriched milk has been instrumental in the control of iodine deciency in several countries. However, this has been largely a consequence of the use ofiodophors by the dairy industry rather than the result of a deliberate addition ofiodine to milk. Iodine-enriched milk has become a major adventitious source of iodine in many countries in northern Europe, as well as in the UnitedKingdom ( 298) and the United States. Use of iodized bread in T asmania was discontinued when other sources of iodine, notably milk (consequent to the useof iodophors by the dairy industry), became available. 5.3.2.5 Other vehicles The feasibility of using sugar as a vehicle for iodine fortication has beenassessed in pilot studies in Sudan ( 299), and that of sh sauce in south-east Asia where it is a major source of dietary sodium (i.e. salt). Besides fortifying tablesalt ( 300). Finland forties its animal fodders and as a result the iodine content of foods derived from animal sources has increased. 5.3.3 Safety issues Iodine fortication is generally very safe. Iodine has been added to salt and bread for more than 50 years without any notable toxic effects ( 301). At its fty-third meeting in 1999, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additivesconcluded that potassium iodate and potassium iodide could continue to be usedto fortify salt for the prevention and control of iodine deciency disorders ( 238). Because the synthesis and release of thyroid hormones is usually well regulated,through mechanisms that enable the body to adjust to a wide range of iodineintakes, intakes of up to 1mg (1000 \u00b5g) per day are tolerated by most people. Nevertheless, an acute, excessive increase in iodine intake can increase the risk of iodine toxicity in susceptible individuals, that is, those who have had chronic iodine deciency. This condition is known as iodine-induced GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 122hyperthyroidism (IIH) and it is the most common complication of iodine pro- phylaxis. Outbreaks have been associated with almost all iodine supplementa-tion programmes ( 302); it tends to occur in the early phase of programme implementation and mainly affects the elderly who have long-standing thyroidnodules. IIH is, however, usually transitory in nature and its incidence ratereverts to normal levels after 1-10 years of intervention. Outbreaks of IIH, which were subsequently attributed to the sudden introduction of excessively iodized salt in populations who had been severelyiodine decient for very long periods, have recently been reported from the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( 303) and Zimbabwe ( 304). Such reports would appear to indicate that IIH could occur if salt is excessively iodized ( 305). If an outbreak of IIH was to occur following the introduction of iodized salt,it would be expected to follow a similar pattern to that observed during iodine supplementation programmes, that is, manifest early on in the history ofthe programme and predominantly among the elderly. IIH prevention requiresthe monitoring of salt iodization levels and the iodine status of the population,coupled with proper training of health staff in the identication and treatmentof IIH ( 306). Iodine-induced thyroiditis is another condition that can be aggravated or even induced by increasing iodine intakes ( 307). T o date, there have been no large- scale investigations of the impact of iodine intervention programmes on iodine-induced thyroiditis. Summary: iodine fortication Universal salt iodization, that is, the iodization of all salt for both human and animal consumption, is the strategy recommended by WHO to correct iodine deciency. Potassium iodate is preferred to potassium iodide for salt iodization because it is more stable. The benets of correcting iodine deciency far outweigh the potential risks of forti- cation. Iodine-induced hyperthroidism and other potential adverse effects can bealmost entirely avoided by adequate and sustained quality assurance and moni- toring of iodine fortication.5. IRON, VITAMIN A AND IODINE 123CHAPTER 6 Zinc, folate and other B vitamins, vitamin C, vitamin D, calcium, seleniumand fluoride 6.1 Zinc 6.1.1 Choice of zinc forticant Zinc compounds that are suitable for use as food forticants include the sulfate, chloride, gluconate, oxide and the stearate. All of these compounds are eitherwhite or colourless, but have varying water solubilities; some have an unpleas-ant taste when added to certain foods. Although it is only poorly water soluble,zinc oxide is the cheapest of the zinc forticants and therefore tends to be thepreferred choice. Recent studies have shown that the absorption of zinc fromcereal products fortied with zinc oxide is as good as that from those fortiedwith the more soluble zinc sulfate ( 308,309 ), presumably because the oxide is soluble in gastric acid. However, zinc absorption from the oxide may be poorin individuals with low stomach acid secretion. 6.1.2 The bioavailability of zinc Zinc absorption from food is dependent on the amount of zinc consumed and the ratio of phytate to zinc in the meal being consumed. According to recentestimates by the International Zinc Nutrition Consultative Group (IZiNCG) , when zinc intake is just adequate to meet the physiological requirements forabsorbed zinc, in adult men about 27% of the zinc content is absorbed fromdiets having a phytate:zinc molar ratio of less than 18, which drops to about 19%when the phytate:zinc molar ratio is greater than 18 (i.e. high phytate). The cor-responding zinc absorption rates for adult women are 35% and 26%, respec-tively ( 109). When zinc intake is greater than the critical level needed to meet requirements, the fractional absorption becomes progressively less, although thenet absorption of zinc increases slightly. In one study involving healthy, well-nourished adults from the United States, zinc absorption from the sulfate (or the oxide) added to a low-phytate bread meal was about 14% (total zinc content, 3.1-3.7mg per meal) compared with around 6% from the same forticantsadded to a high-phytate wheat porridge meal (total zinc content, 2.7-3.1mg permeal) ( 309). 1246.1.3 Methods used to increase zinc absorption from forticants In light of the above ndings, and given the similarities to iron (see section 5.1.2 ), it is reasonable to assume that reducing the phytic acid content of food willincrease the absorption of zinc from forticants, at least in the case of adults(310). Whether the same applies to infants and young children is uncertain. A lower extraction rate will result in a reduced phytate content of cereals but alsoa reduced zinc content, so the net effect on zinc supply tends to be minimal.Alternatively, the phytate content can be reduced by activating the phytases thatare naturally present in most phytate-containing foods (through germination,fermentation and/or soaking) or by adding microbial or fungal phytases. Includ-ing sources of animal protein in the diet has also been shown to be an effectiveway of improving zinc absorption from high-phytate diets ( 93). Absorption enhancers equivalent to ascorbic acid for iron, do not exist for zinc. However, according to the results of one study conducted in adult women,the addition of NaFeEDTA as a forticant can increase zinc absorption fromthe diet, in this case from about 20% to 35%; 1% of the additional amount ofzinc absorbed was excreted in the urine ( 311). This nding has yet to be con- rmed in other studies. However, if, as reports suggest, the addition ofNa 2EDTA or NaFeEDTA to cereal flours inhibits the action of yeast during the bread-making process, these compounds would be of limited use, at least incereal flours. 6.1.4 Experience with zinc fortication of specic foods Hitherto, fortication with zinc has been fairly limited, and is generally conned to infant formula milks (with zinc sulfate), complementary foods and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals (in the United States). In Indonesia it is mandatory to add zinc to wheat noodles. More recently, several Latin American countries have expressed some interest in fortifying cereal flours with zinc. Several studies have demonstrated the benets of zinc supplementation on the growth rate of children (see section 4.1.3 ). However, very few trials have assessed the efcacy or effectiveness of zinc fortication. Although the additionof zinc oxide to breakfast cereals increased plasma zinc concentrations in pre-school-aged children in the United States, there was no evidence of concomi-tant increases in growth rates or in food intake ( 312). However, in Turkey, zinc fortication of bread did increase the growth rates of schoolchildren who ini-tially had low plasma zinc ( 313). Little is known about the effects of added zinc on the sensory properties of foods. The fortication of wheat flour with relatively high levels of zinc (as zincacetate) did not affect the baking or organoleptic properties of the bread dough(313). Likewise, the addition of 60 or 100mg zinc/kg wheat flour (as zinc sulfate or zinc oxide) did not change the acceptability of bread ( 314). Encapsulation of6. ZINC, B VITAMINS, VITAMINS C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 125zinc compounds is possible but has not been considered to date. This would, however, be a convenient way to mask the unpleasant taste of some zinc compounds. 6.2 Folate and other B vitamins The B-complex vitamins are considered as a group in this chapter, as not onlydo they share some similar characteristics when used as food forticants butthey also tend to be added to the same foods. Members of the group of B vitamins covered here include folate/folic acid (vitamin B 9), thiamine (vitamin B1), riboflavin (vitamin B 2), niacin, pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) and vitamin B 12 (cobalamin). 6.2.1 Choice of vitamin B forticants The characteristics of the vitamin B compounds that are suitable for adding to foods are summarized in Table 6.1 .In general, the B vitamins are rela- tively stable, with thiamine being the most labile to heat. Synthetic folate,i.e. folic acid (in the form of pteroyl monoglutamic acid) is moderately heat stable ( 315), but is susceptible to the effects of oxidizing and reducing agents ( 316). Some forticant loss is inevitable, the degree of loss being dependent on factors such as the temperature used during food processing or preparation, themoisture content ,extrusion temperatures and pressures, the presence of other micronutrients (in the premix and in the fortied food), the nature of the pack-aging, and the anticipated shelf-life of the fortied product. Vitamin recoveriesin bread made from fortied flour range from about 70% 95% any added thi-amine, pyridoxine and niacin is retained when enriched flour is used to preparepasta, even after drying and cooking. On this basis, and assuming that any addedB vitamins are 100% absorbed, in flour an overage of approximately 20-30% isthus usually sufcient to provide the desired amount in food products such asbreads and cereals. Folic acid has a light yellow colour, which does not carry over to fortied foods because it is added at such low levels, typically between 1.5 and 2.4ppm.There is some loss of the vitamin on exposure to light, and during cooking andbaking. The biggest losses tend to occur from biscuits and pasta, but even theseare probably no more than 20%. As folic acid concentrations in foods are dif-cult to measure, reported levels in fortied flour and baked products are oftensubject to considerable assay error.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 1266.

Dark red, often supplied diluted on a carrier (0.1%)6.2.2 Experience with vitamin B fortication of specic foods There is a long history of experience of adding B vitamins to cereals (including wheat and maize flours) and rice grains, in both industrialized and developingcountries.The benets of restoration of thiamine, riboflavin and niacin in cerealsand flours, 65-80% of which are removed by milling, have long been recognized.Indeed, the enrichment of flours and cereals has made, and continues to make,a major contribution to meeting the recommended intake of these vitamins evenin the industrialized countries ( 317). The amount of niacin added to wheat flour typically ranges from 15 to 70mg/kg ( 178); thiamine (vitamin B 1) addition levels range from 1.5 to 11mg/kg, and those for vitamin B 12,from 1.3 to 4mg/kg ( 318). About 75% of the folate in whole wheat is also lost during milling, but folic acid has been included in cereal fortication programmes only relatively recently.In 1998, it became mandatory to fortify grain products with folic acid in theUnited States, the rationale being that it would lower the prevalence of neural tube defect births.The required fortication level is 154 \u00b5g/100g flour (Mandate 21 CFR 137.165). According to one assessment the impact of this measure hasbeen a 26% reduction in the incidence of neural tube defects ( 48). Mandatory folate acid fortication has also quite rapidly lowered the prevalence of lowplasma folate concentrations in adults from around 22% to almost zero, andreduced the prevalence of elevated plasma homocysteine by about 50% ( 49). In addition to the United States, some 30 countries now add folic acid to flour,including Canada (150 \u00b5g/100g), Chile (220 \u00b5g/100g wheat flour), Costa Rica (180 \u00b5g/100g), Dominican Republic (180 \u00b5g/100g), El Salvador (180 \u00b5g/100g), Guatemala (180 \u00b5g/100g), Honduras (180 \u00b5g/100g), Indonesia (200 \u00b5g/100g wheat flour), Mexico (200 \u00b5g/100g wheat flour), Nicaragua (180 \u00b5g/100g) and Panama (180 \u00b5g/100g) ( 318). The B-complex vitamins are added directly to flour as single nutrients or as a premix (which usually also contains iron), or they are diluted with a smallamount of flour at the mill before being added to the bulk. In the case of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, the B vitamins can either be added to the dry mix priorto extrusion or other processes, or a vitamin solution or suspension can besprayed onto the cereals after they have been toasted. Riboflavin has a strongyellow colour and slightly bitter taste, but at the levels that are typically added to white flour any colour or taste problems are likely to be minimal. Coatedforms of the water-soluble vitamins, such as thiamine and vitamin B 6,are avail- able if off-flavours or other problems arise 6.1 ). 6.2.3 Safety concerns 6.2.3.1 Thiamine, riboflavin and vitamin B 6 As toxicity is not a problem, the United States Food and Nutrition Board has not dened upper intake limits (ULs) for thiamine and riboflavin .In the caseGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 128of vitamin B 6,sensory neuropathy has been linked to high intakes of supple- ments but according to the ndings of the United States Food and NutritionBoard, \"No adverse effects associated with vitamin B 6from food have been reported. This does not mean that there is no potential for adverse effects result-ing from high intakes. Because data on the adverse effects of vitamin B 6are limited, caution may be warranted\". A UL of 100mg for adults and 30-40mgfor children has thus been set ( 128).These levels are very unlikely to be obtained from fortied foods. 6.2.3.2 Niacin (nicotinic acid and niacinamide) Vasodilation or flushing (i.e. a burning or itching sensation in the face, arms and chest) has been observed as a rst adverse effect in patients given high doses ofnicotinic acid for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Based on such evidence, theUnited States Food and Nutrition Board has dened a UL of 35mg/day fornicotinic acid ( 128). Intakes of niacinamide have, however, not been associated with flushing effects. Bearing in mind the different characteristics of the two forms of niacin, the Scientic Committee for Food in the European Union has proposed a UL fornicotinic acid of 10mg/day and a separate, much higher, UL for niacinamide of900mg /day ( 319). The latter thus poses no safety limitations in common food fortication practice. 6.2.3.3 Folic acid forticants The consumption of folic acid in amounts normally found in fortied foods hasnot been associated with adverse health effects. However, there has been someconcern that high folic acid intakes could mask or exacerbate neurological prob-lems, such as pernicious anaemia, in people with low intakes of vitamin B 12 (128). This has led to a reluctance to fortify with folic acid in some countries. This concern is particularly pertinent to those individuals who derive folic acidfrom both supplements and a range of fortied foods, as it is the case in manyindustrialized countries. In this situation, some people may exceed the UL forfolic acid, which has been set at 1mg/day ( 128)(129old 110). An obvious solu- tion to this potential problem is to fortify foods with both vitamin B 12and folic acid. Toavoid any possible risk of adverse effects, folic acid fortication pro- grammes should be designed so as to limit regular daily intakes to a maximum of 1mg. In addition, measures which require folic acid-containing supplementsand fortied foods to also contain vitamin B 12could be considered, especially in the case of products consumed by older citizens who are at greater risk ofvitamin B 12deciency and its associated conditions, in particular, pernicious anaemia.6. ZINC, B VITAMINS, VITAMINS C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 1296.3 Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) 6.3.1 Choice of vitamin C forticant Ascorbic acid and ascorbyl palmitate are often added to oils, fats, soft drinks and various other foods as a way of improving the stability of other added micronu- trients (e.g. vitamin A) or as an iron absorption enhancer (see section 5.1.2.1 ). However, ascorbic acid is itself relatively unstable in the presence of oxygen,metals, humidity and/or high temperatures. T o retain vitamin C integrity (espe-cially during storage), foods must therefore be appropriately packaged, or theascorbic acid encapsulated. 6.3.2 Experience with vitamin C fortication of specic foods As a general rule, foods that are not cooked are better vehicles for vitamin C fortication. Blended foods, such as those used for feeding programmes in emer-gency situations, were often fortied with vitamin C as this was believed to bethe most efcient way of delivering this nutrient to populations likely to be de-cient. However, a trial with PL-480 cereals found that although almost all of theencapsulated forticant ascorbic acid was retained during transit from theUnited States to Africa, it was rapidly destroyed when the cereal product wascooked for 10 minutes ( 270). On the other hand, the addition of vitamin C to commercially processed foods such as dry milk, infant formulas, cereal-basedcomplementary foods, chocolate drink powders and beverages has been foundto be successful in increasing intakes of this nutrient. As sugar helps to protectthe ascorbic acid in soft drinks, sugar has been proposed as a possible vehiclefor the vitamin ( 184). 6.4 Vitamin D 6.4.1 Choice of vitamin D forticant Either vitamin D 2(ergocalciferol) or D 3(cholecalciferol) can be added to foods. The two forms have similar biological activities and both are very sensitive tooxygen and moisture, and both interact with minerals. A dry stabilized form of vitamin D, which contains an antioxidant (usually tocopherol) that protectsactivity even in the presence of minerals, is generally used for most commercialapplications. 6.4.2 Experience with vitamin D fortication of specic foods Milk and other dairy products, including dried milk powder and evaporated milk, are often fortied with vitamin D. Many countries also fortify margarineswith this vitamin. Low exposure to sunlight is a risk factor for vitamin D deciency and can be a problem among those who live in the more northerly or southerly latitudesGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 130where UV radiation levels are lower during the winter months, and among women who, for cultural reasons, spend a large proportion of their time indoors or covered with clothing. In such situations, vitamin D fortication of milk andmargarine have been found to be useful strategies for increasing intakes; the goalis to supply up to 200IU/day in the total diet. 6.5 Calcium Compared with other micronutrients, calcium is required in relatively largeamounts. A heightened awareness of the need to increase intakes of calcium forosteoporosis prevention has meant that calcium fortication has attracted a gooddeal of interest in recent years. 6.5.1 Choice of calcium forticants Calcium salts suitable for use as food forticants are listed in Table 6.2 .Bioavail- able forms recommended for the fortication of infant formulas and comple-mentary foods include the carbonate (it can liberate CO 2in acid systems), the chloride, the citrate and orthophosphate, and the oxide ( 320). All of these salts are either white or colourless. Most are bland although the citrate has a tart flavour, the hydroxide is slightlybitter, and high concentrations of the chloride and the lactate can be unpleas-ant. The cost of calcium carbonate is very low, usually less than that of flour. As the daily amount of calcium required is several thousand times higher than that of most other micronutrients, it tends to be added separately (as opposedto part of a premix). The calcium content of commercially available salts rangesfrom 9% (the gluconate) to 71% (the oxide) (Table 6.2) .Salts with lower con- centrations will have to be added in larger amounts, a factor that may affect thenal choice of forticant. There is little reason to believe that low solubility is a major constraint to the bioavailability of forticant calcium. In general, absorption of added calcium issimilar to that naturally present in foods, which ranges from about 10% to 30%.However, high levels of calcium inhibit the absorption of iron from foods and so this too is something that needs to be taken into consideration when decid- ing how much calcium to add. The co-addition of ascorbic acid can help over-come the inhibitory effect of calcium on iron absorption. 6.5.2 Experience with calcium fortication Wheat flour was rst fortied with calcium in the United Kingdom in 1943 in order to restore the calcium lost during milling. T oday, it is compulsory to add940-1560mg calcium carbonate/kg to white and brown (but not wholegrain)6. ZINC, B VITAMINS, VITAMINS C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 131flours milled in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the addition of calcium to flour has been optional since the early 1940s. Calcium sulfate, car-bonate, chloride, phosphate, acetate or lactate are all suitable for fortication ofwheat flours, but the oxide and hydroxide may require alterations in the pH ofthe dough for successful bread-making ( 321). The range of foods that are fortied with calcium has steadily grown over the years as it became increasingly clear that intakes were low in many populations. The more soluble calcium salts, such as the citrate malate or the gluconate, aregenerally used to fortify juices and other beverages. Tribasic calcium phosphate,and sometimes calcium carbonate or lactate, is used to fortify milk, to whichgums (e.g. carrageenan, guar gum) must also be added to prevent the calciumsalt from sedimenting.Y oghurt and cottage cheese can also be fortied with thesecalcium compounds. In industrialized nations and in some Asian countries, soyabeverages are marketed as a replacement for cow's milk in which case these tooshould be fortied with calcium. Stabilizers such as sodium hexametaphosphateGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 132TABLE 6.2 Calcium forticants: physical characteristics Compound Calcium Colour Taste Odour Solubility Colourless 6 712Sulfate 29 Varies - - 15.3Hydroxyapatite 40 - - - 0.08Calcium phosphate 30 White Sandy, bland - 1.84 dibasic Calcium phosphate 17 Colourless Sandy, bland - 71.4 monobasic Calcium phosphate 38 White Sandy, bland Odourless Calcium 31 Colourless - - Insoluble pyrophosphate 19 White Almost Odourless 95.2 tasteless Acetate 25 Colourless - - 2 364Lactate 13 White Neutral Almost 0.13 odourless Citrate 24 Colourless clean Odourless 1.49Citrate 54 Colourless Slightly bitter Odourless 25.0 Oxide 71 - - 23.3 Source: adapted from reference ( 320).or potassium citrate can improve the quality of soya beverages fortied with calcium gluconate or lactogluconate. The addition of calcium salts to some foods can cause undesirable changes in colour, texture and stability by increasing the cross-linking of proteins, pectinsand gums. Calcium forticants can also darken the colour of chocolate beverages. 6.6. Selenium 6.6.1 Choice of forticant For food fortication purposes, the sodium salts are generally considered to be the most suitable source of selenium. The selenite is a white, water-soluble com-pound, from which absorption is about 50%. It is readily reduced to unab-sorbable elemental selenium by reducing agents, such as ascorbic acid and sulfurdioxide. Sodium selenate is colourless, and is less soluble in water and morestable than the selenite, especially in the presence of copper and iron. It has thebetter absorption (nearly 100% from the forticant alone or 50-80% depend-ing on the food vehicle to which it has been added), and also increases the activ-ity of the enzyme, glutathione peroxidase, more effectively. When tested inmilk-based infant formulas, more selenium was absorbed from the selenate (97%versus 73%), but as more selenium was excreted in the urine with the selenate (36% versus 10%), the net retention of selenium appears to be similar regard-less of which chemical form is used ( 322). The relative retention of selenium from other fortied foods, including salt, has not been investigated. Organicforms of selenium, such as selenomethionine, are absorbed as well as the sele-nate, but remain longer in the body and thus theoretically pose a higher risk oftoxicity. They have not been widely used for food fortication for this reason. 6.6.2 Experience with selenium fortication of selected foods In regions of China where selenium deciency is endemic, salt has been forti- ed with selenite (15mg/kg) since 1983.This measure selenium intakes from 11 \u00b5g to 80 \u00b5g and has effectively reduced the preva- lence of Keshan disease (see also section 4.8.3 ). Sodium selenate is currently used to fortify a range of foods in various parts of the world. In Finland, for example, sodium selenate is added to fertilizersapplied in areas having low soil selenium; measurable increases in the seleniumcontent of milk, meat and cereals grown on these soils were observed within 6months ( 217). Sodium selenate is an ingredient in some sports drinks (around 10\u00b5g/l) and in the United States is used to fortify infant foods. Until 1985, bread supplied about half of the selenium intake for the United Kingdom population,but after 1985, when European wheat was replaced by Canadian wheat this dropped to about 20%.6. ZINC, B VITAMINS, VITAMINS C AND D, CALCIUM, SELENIUM AND FLUORIDE 1336.7 Fluoride 6.7.1 Choice of forticant a ways in which fluoride intakes can be increased: fluo- ride can be added to water supplies at the point of supply or added to tooth- paste. Hexa-fluoro-silicate acid (HUSIAC) is the most commonly used fluoridecompound for large-scale water fortication. It is added as a concentratedaqueous solution. The fluoridation of salt and the enrichment of milk with fluo-ride are alternative options that have been used in some parts of the world. 6.7.2 Experience of fluoridation The introduction of a salt fluoridation programme in Jamaica was associated with a large reduction in dental decay in children, when assessed after 7 years(323). However, a smaller trial in Hungary indicated that residence during early infancy in an area where salt was fluoridated was not associated with a reducedrisk of later caries ( 324). In Costa Rica, a national fluoride salt fortication pro- gramme, requiring the addition of 225-275mg fluoride/kg salt, became manda- tory in 1989. There then followed a very substantial and progressive reductionin tooth decay, and in 1999, based on measurements of urinary fluorine excre-tion rates, the level of fluoride in salt was lowered to 175-225mg/kg ( 325). However, it is possible that other sources of fluoride (i.e. toothpaste) may havecontributed to the observed reduction in the prevalence of tooth decay in Costa Rica. Where it is impractical or unacceptable to fluoridate water or salt, the addi- tion of fluoride to milk is an alternative approach for preventing dental caries.Generally speaking, the level of fluoridation is best governed by the usual volumeof milk consumed by young children. Guidelines for fluoride fortication of milkand milk products are available elsewhere ( 326). A recent evaluation of the feasibility of adding fluoride to school milk in the United Kingdom concluded that fortication was both feasible and desirable(327). In rural Chile, preschool-aged children received 0.25-0.75mg fluoride per day in fortied, powdered milk for a period of 4 years. The rate of decayed,missing and lled teeth declined substantially compared with a control com-munity, and the percentage of children who remained caries-free doubled ( 328). Favourable results have also been reported from Beijing, in children who con- sumed 0.5mg fluoride in milk each day at kindergarten and 0.6mg fluoride inmilk at home on weekend days ( 329). Similarly, in Scotland schoolchildren who consumed 1.5mg fluoride daily in 200ml milk had a signicantly lower preva-lence of caries than a control group after 5 years ( 330). However, these results were not replicated in a more recent study conducted in another region of the United Kingdom ( 331).GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 134PARTIV Implementing effective and sustainable food fortication programmesIntroduction As the preceding chapters have demonstrated, food fortication has a long history of successful practice. Notable successes have been in achieved in thecase of the iodization of salt, the fortication of flour with various B vitamins,and the fortication of margarines with vitamin A. It would, however, be some-thing of an overstatement to say that these past successes have been the resultof formal, scientically-rigorous evaluations of the nutritional status and needsof the target population. In many cases, decisions about how much forticantto add to a chosen food vehicle were based on what was known to be techni-cally possible at the time, and governed by budgetary limits. With a view to putting fortication programme planning on a sounder footing, this section of the present Guidelines sets out a systematic and method-ological approach to designing and planning a food fortication programme.The key elements are as follows: \u2014dening and setting nutritional goals (i.e. framing decisions about how much micronutrient(s) to add to which foods); \u2014programme monitoring and evaluation (i.e. establishing procedures which check that fortied foods contain the intended amount of micronutrient(s)and that they are being consumed by the target population in adequateamounts); \u2014communicating and marketing fortication programmes (i.e. informing the target population about the benets of fortication so that they choseto consume fortied foods). In order to be able to correct a micronutrient deciency in a population, which is after all the ultimate goal of any fortication programme, it is necessary torst ascertain the extent of the deciency and then the increase in intake that isneeded to satisfy the daily requirement for that micronutrient. Chapter 7explains the application of the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) cut-pointmethod to the problem of calculating the level of micronutrient additions thatis needed to bring the prevalence of low intakes among a target population toan acceptably small level. This is the WHO recommended method and is appli- cable to all micronutrients covered in these Guidelines, with the exception of 137iron (for which an alternative methodology is described).The information needs for such computations, e.g. data on food and nutrient intake distributions, arealso outlined. Having estimated the ideal level of micronutrient addition required to achieve a given nutritional goal, programme planners are then advised to con-sider whether this level of fortication is feasible given current technology andany safety or cost constraints that may be operating, or whether, additional meas-ures (e.g. supplementation), may be a better way of reaching nutritional targets,atleast for some population subgroups. T echnological, cost and safety limits are thus dened and a series of examples are provided to show how these can beused to shape the nal decision about fortication levels appropriate to a givensituation. The primary objective of monitoring and evaluation activities is to ascertain whether or not a fortication programme is achieving its nutritional goals onceit has been implemented. These are critical to the success of any forticationprogramme and should be viewed as an integral part of overall programmedesign. Monitoring and evaluation activities take place at a number of levels.The main purpose of monitoring is to track the operational performance (orimplementation efciency) of a programme. Only after monitoring has estab-lished that a fortied product of the desired quality is available and accessibleto the target population in adequate amounts, can the impact of the interven-tion be evaluated. T o date, relatively few fortication programmes have beenproperly evaluated, partly because impact evaluation is widely perceived to beboth a complex and costly exercise. The methodologies outlined in Chapter 8aim to demystify the process of evaluating the impact of fortication programmes. Chapter 9 explores the potential usefulness of the application of cost-effectiveness and cost-benet analysis techniques to food forticationinterventions, something that is also in its infancy. The examples given clearlydemonstrate that fortication has the potential to be a particularly cost-effectivesolution to the problem of micronutrient malnutrition in many settings. In order to ensure that fortied foods are consumed in adequate amounts by those who require them most, all fortication programmes will need to be sup-ported by the right mix of educational and social marketing activities. Like mon-itoring and evaluation, this third key element should also be thought about atthe design and planning stages of a fortication programme. Chapter 10 out-lines the communication needs of all the various parties involved in the runningof fortication programmes, not just the consumer, and provides guidance onhow messages might be framed to best meet these needs. An understanding ofthe regulatory environment is also essential, and therefore these Guidelines con-clude with an overview of the mechanisms for regulating fortication throughnational food laws. Reference to the international context is made wherever relevant.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 138CHAPTER 7 Dening and setting programme goals 7.1 Information needs In order to be able to design a successful fortication programme that achieves its nutritional objectives, it is necessary to have rst gathered some backgroundinformation and nutritional data, in particular: biochemical/chemical data on nutritional status (i.e. data on the scale and severity of specic nutrient deciencies in different population groups; seePartII); data on dietary patterns (i.e. the composition of the usual diet); detailed information on dietary intakes of micronutrients of interest (i.e. the distribution of usual intakes of specic micronutrients in a population). This information is required to conrm the need and provide a rationale for a fortication programme. Having established the need for an intervention, thesame information and data can then be used to identify and prioritize the targetpopulation groups, decide which micronutrients (and in what amounts) shouldbe added to which foods, and to identify and understand any constraints (e.g.safety, cost, technological) that may impact on the amounts of nutrients that canbe added to given foods. Specic data needs are outlined in greater detail below,whereas related issues of a more general nature, but equally important withregards to the planning stages of fortication programmes, are reviewed in Box 7.1. 7.1.1 Biochemical and clinical evidence of specic micronutrient deciencies PartII of these Guidelines describes how it is possible to classify the severity of a public health problem caused by specic micronutrient deciencies usingvarious biochemical and clinical indicators and criteria. Where clinical or bio- chemical data indicate a high prevalence of deciency of a specic nutrient, thisis usually regarded as being good evidence that the diet is not supplying enoughof that particular micronutrient and that fortication is warranted. The moresevere and widespread the deciency, the greater the need for intervention. 139GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 140BOX7.1 Planninganddesigningaforticationprogramme:preliminary considerations The decision to implement a micronutrient fortication programme requires documented evidence that the micronutrient content of the diet is insufcientor that fortication will produce a health benet. The objective is to lower theprevalence of micronutrient deciencies in the population and to optimizehealth. In some situations, an insufcient intake of micronutrients is not the only risk factor for micronutrient deciency. Other factors can play a substantial role,including, for example, the presence of infections and parasites (which,among other things, can contribute to high rates of anaemia). In these situ-ations, it is important to determine whether fortication is a cost-effective strategy compared with other interventions (e.g. the control of infections and parasites). The need for a fortication programme should always be examined in the broader context of all the possible options for controlling micronutrient de- ciency. It may be that, overall, a combination of interventions (i.e. fortica- tion plus other interventions) provides the most cost-effective option. Forinstance, supplementation plus fortication might be a better way to ensurethat specic population groups (e.g. pregnant women and young children who are often the most vulnerable groups) are protected against micronutri- ent deciencies than fortication alone. Health authorities looking to initiate a micronutrient fortication programme should not do so without rst collecting food intake data, supported by ancil-lary information such as biochemical data on nutritional status. This infor- mation is necessary to justify the programme, to make an informed judgement about the types and amounts of specic nutrients to include, andto understand which foods would make suitable vehicles for fortication.Given the long-term effort and investment required to implement and sustain fortication programmes, and the need to ensure that the outcome is intakes that are adequate and not excessive, it is essential to make this initial invest-ment in the collection of adequate food intake data. Trained nutritionists willbe needed for detailed programme planning, as well as for the subsequentmonitoring and evaluation stages, the aim of which is to see how the programme has affected the nutrient intakes and nutritional status of the recipients. In terms of providing reliable information on micronutrient status at the pop- ulation level, biochemical and clinical data do, however, have a number of lim-itations. Firstly, available resources are usually such that only a relatively smallnumber of individuals are tested or observed, and those that are sampled arenot always representative of all relevant population subgroups. Secondly, somebiochemical data are difcult to interpret because of confounding factors, such as the presence of infections, or interactions among micronutrient deciencies(see Tables 3.1, 3.4, 3.6, 4.11, 4.13-16 ). Biochem- ical indicators of iron status are especially prone to problems of this nature(Table 3.1 ). It is especially important to recognize situations where non-dietary factors, such as parasitic infections, are likely to be a major cause of observedmicronutrient deciencies; this will be reflected in a greater severity and preva-lence of deciencies than would be predicted from dietary data. Under such cir-cumstances, other public health measures - in addition to fortication - may beneeded to reduce the burden of MNM. A third limitation is a lack of data, either because of the absence of a suitable biomarker of deciency or simply because, to date, little investigation has takenplace. This means that the prevalence of many deciencies suspected of beingrelatively common (e.g. riboflavin (vitamin B 2), vitamin B 12,zinc and calcium) is not well known ( Table 1.2 ). In some cases, however, evidence of a deciency in one micronutrient predicts the existence of deciencies in others. Forexample, a high prevalence of anaemia and vitamin A deciency is often accom-panied by zinc, vitamin B 12and riboflavin (vitamin B 2) deciencies, because the underlying problem in all cases is an inadequate intake of animal source foods(see Chapter 4). 7.1.2 Dietary patterns Knowledge of the usual foods consumed can be a useful supplement to bio- chemical and clinical evidence of micronutrient deciencies, and in the absenceof the latter can help pinpoint which micronutrients are most likely to be lackingin the diet. For example, animal source foods are the major source of vitaminsA and D, thiamin (vitamin B 1), riboflavin (vitamin B 2), iron, zinc and calcium, and are the only source of vitamin B 12.They also provide an important amount of fat, the presence of which in the diet improves the absorption of fat-solublevitamins. Populations with a low intake of animal source foods are thus likely toexperience deciencies in some or all of these nutrients. It is common for the intake of animal source foods to be low in disadvan- taged populations; sometimes these foods are avoided because of religious orother beliefs. Another widespread problem, particularly among refugees and dis-placed populations, is inadequate consumption of fruits and vegetables and con-sequently low intakes of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and folate. In locations wherephytate or polyphenol intakes are high, the risk of iron and zinc decienciesincreases because the bioavailability of both of these minerals from foods isreduced in the presence of these compounds. At the population level, food balance sheets, such as those produced by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), can provide7. DEFINING AND SETTING PROGRAMME GOAL 141some useful information about usual dietary patterns and also on the average consumption of certain foods that are rich in micronutrients or in absorptioninhibitors, which in turn can be used to predict probable micronutrient de- ciencies. Their main limitation is that, in providing information on the averageintake by the general population, they do not reflect the distribution of intakesbypopulation subgroups. 7.1.3 Usual dietary intakes As they are the basis of decisions about which micronutrients to add to which foods and in what amounts, the possession of quantitative food and nutrientintake data is a prerequisite for any food fortication programme. Food intakedata are also needed for predicting the probable impact of potential forticationinterventions. Food and nutrient intake information should be available for, orcollected from, different population groups (e.g. those differing in socioeco-nomic status, ethnicity or religious beliefs) and from different physiological status groups (e.g. children, women). In reality, there is usually a wide range of food and nutrient intakes within any given population subgroup. As is explained in more detail later in thechapter, it is this range or the distribution of usual intakes that is of primaryinterest and which forms the basis for both the planning and the evaluation offood fortication interventions (see sections 7.2 and 7.3). 7.2 Dening nutritional goals: basic concepts The main goal of a fortication programme is to correct inadequate micronu-trient intakes through the fortication of foods, thereby preventing, or reducing,the severity and prevalence of micronutrient deciencies. Interventions of thisnature can involve either fortifying a single food product (e.g. the iodization ofsalt) or the fortication of several foods. In practice, food fortication programmes are devised so as to achieve a level of fortication such that, when the programme is in place, the probability of thenutrient intake being inadequate in a given population - either insufcient orexcessive - is acceptably low.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 142The dietary goal of fortication is formally dened in these Guidelines as follows: to provide most (97.5%) of individuals in the population group(s) at greatest riskof deciency with an adequate intake of specic micronutrients, without causing a risk of excessive intakes in this or other groups.7.2.1 The EAR cut-point method The approach recommended in these WHO Guidelines for setting forticant levels in foods is the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)1cut-point method .This approach was proposed some years ago, and is described in detail in a reportbythe United States Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine (FNB/IOM) on dietary reference intakes ( 333). As its starting point, the EAR cut-point method assumes that the proportion of a population with intakes below the EAR for a given nutrient corresponds tothe proportion having an inadequate intake of that nutrient (see Figure 7.1 ). The EAR cut-point approach requires a decision to be made about the accept-able prevalence of inadequate (and excessive) intakes (often taken to be 2-3%for reasons which are explained more fully below: see section 7.3.1). Then bycombining information on the range of usual intakes of a population subgroupwith information on the nutrient requirements for that subgroup (i.e. the EAR), it is possible to derive a level of food fortication that will give an intake distri- bution such that usual nutrient intakes meet the requirements of all but a small specied proportion of the subgroup. In other words, the method allows its usersto nd the additional intake of micronutrients that would shift the distributionof intakes upwards so that only a small proportion of the population group is atrisk of having an inadequate intake. Here the term \"subgroup\" refers to various age, gender and physiological status groups of the population (e.g. pregnant orlactating women). The EAR cut-point methodology is outlined in greater detailin section 7.3 and is illustrated by means of a worked example. The EAR cut-point method is a simplied, easier to use version of the prob- ability method, which requires calculating the probability of inadequacy of intakefor each individual in a population subgroup, averaging the probabilities, andthen using this average as an estimate of the prevalence of inadequacy ( 333). These two approaches, the EAR cut-point method and the probability method,givesimilar results as long as the assumptions underlying them are met. For the probability method, there should be little or no correlation between intake andrequirements, which is assumed to be true for all nutrients but energy. In thecase of the EAR cut-point method, the variation in intake of a nutrient by a pop-ulation group should be greater than the variation in the requirement for thisnutrient (also assumed to be true for most nutrients and most groups), and thedistribution of requirements must be symmetrical (believed to be true for allnutrients except iron). Thus for most applications and nutrients, either methodis appropriate, with the exception of iron for which only the probability methodis valid (see section 7.3.3.1).7. DEFINING AND SETTING PROGRAMME GOAL 1431The Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for a micronutrient is dened as the average daily intake that is estimated to meet the requirements of half of the healthy individuals in a particularlife stage and gender subgroup ( 332).The EAR cut-point approach is different from the past practice of using the Recommended Nutrient Intake (or Recommended Dietary Allowance) of anutrient as the desirable or \"target\" intake. For reasons that are explained morefully below, the latter approach is valid for deriving the desired nutritional intakeof an individual ,but not that of a population. 7.2.2 Dietary reference values: Estimated Average Requirements, Recommended Nutrient Intakes and upper limits 7.2.2.1 Recommended Nutrient Intakes Dietary specic micronutrients, aimed at minimizing the riskof nutrient decit or excess, have been specied by various national and inter-national bodies, including FAO and WHO. The Recommended Nutrient Intake(RNI) is dened by FAO/WHO as the daily dietary intake level that is sufcientto meet the nutrient requirement of almost all (i.e. 97-98%) healthy individualsin a particular age, gender and physiological status group ( 93). For most nutri- ents, the RNI is set at about 2 standard deviations higher than the averageamount required by a population group (i.e. the EAR), in order that the require-ments of almost every person in the group are met. The standard deviation (orcoefcient of variation) 1of the requirement for each nutrient varies with age, gender and physiological status but for most nutrients and subgroups is between10% and 20%. Table 7.1 lists published FAO/WHO RNI values for all micronutrients covered by these Guidelines for selected age and gender groups ( 93).

The bioavailability of zinc is high from diets rich in animal protein, moderate from diets rich in legumes and pulses or diets that include fermented cereals, and low from diets poor in animal protein or zinc-rich plant foods. Source: reference (93), which also provides values for other age and gender groups. T.FAO/WHO RNI values are broadly similar to dietary reference values dened byother national and international bodies. Various dietary reference values in common usage, and their equivalence, are summarized in Box 7.2. For the majority of micronutrients, the highest recommended intakes are for adult males, the notable exception being iron. Nevertheless, this population sub-group usually has the lowest risk of micronutrient deciencies due to its higher food intake and its lower micronutrient requirements per unit body weight. Indi-viduals at most risk of not meeting their RNIs are infants, young children andwomen of reproductive age, especially pregnant and lactating women. Some of these groups (e.g. pregnant or lactating women) may even have higher require-ments for specic nutrients than do adult men. 7.2.2.2 Calculating Estimated Average Requirements from Recommended Nutrient Intakes Although they form the basis of most RNIs (which are usually set at 2 standard deviations above the corresponding EAR for any given population subgroup),GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 146BOX7.2 FAO/WHORNIs:comparisonswithdietaryreferencevalues denedbyotherbodies 1. Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine (FNB/IOM), United States of America The FAO/WHO RNI is conceptually equivalent to the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), one of the four levels of dietary reference intakes used in Canada and the United States of America. The other three values are the Esti- mated Average Requirement (EAR), the Adequate Intake (AI), and the Tolera- ble Upper Level (UL)1. 2. Department of Health, United Kingdom The FAO/WHO RNI is conceptually similar to the Reference Nutrient Intake (RNI), one of the four dietary reference values used in the United Kingdom (334). The others are the Estimated Average Requirement , the Lower Reference Nutrient Intake (a concept that is unique to the United Kingdom) and the Safe Intake , which is conceptually similar to the Adequate Intake as dened by the United States FNB/IOM. 3. Scientic Committee for Foods, Commission of the European Community The European Community currently uses three reference values: the Population Requirement Intake (PRI), which is conceptually equivalent to FAO/WHO RNI, theAverage Requirement (AR) and the Lower Threshold Intake (LTI) ( 335). 1For further information relating to the work and publications of the Food and Nutrition Board, please refer to the web site of the National Academies Press (http://www.nap.edu).FAO/WHO do not routinely publish EAR values. However, the FAO/WHO RNIs, or equivalent recommendations made by other countries or regions, canbe easily converted into EARs by the application of appropriate conversion factors. The conversion factors, which are presented for the micronutrientscovered by these Guidelines in Annex C ,are the equivalent of subtracting 2 standard deviations from the RNI. For example, the standard deviation of therequirement for vitamin A by 1-3-year-old children is 20%; dividing the relevantRNI (400 \u00b5g RE) by 1.4 (i.e. 1 +(2\u00d70.2)) gives an EAR of 286 \u00b5g RE. The EARs corresponding to RNIs given in Table 7.1 ,and calculated in this way, are listed in Table 7.2. 7.2.2.3 Upper levels of intake The most appropriate reference value for determining whether or not the micronutrient intakes of population subgroups are safe, i.e. do not reach levelsatwhich there is any risk of excessive intake, is the T olerable Upper Intake Level (UL). The UL is the highest average intake that will not pose a risk of adversehealth effects for virtually anyone in the population. The risk of adverse effectsincreases at intakes above the UL. The risks of excessive intakes are describedin detail by FAO/WHO ( 93), and the States FNB/IOM ( 332,333 ). Like EARs and RNIs, ULs vary by age and gender but tend to be lower for young children and pregnant women. ULs for a range of micronutrients are given in Table 7.3. For those micronutrients for which FAO/WHO have not rec- ommended a UL (i.e. iron, folate, fluoride and iodine), the values given in thetable are based on recommendations of either the United States FNB/IOM orthe Scientic Committee for Food of the European Community. 7.3 Using the EAR cut-point method to set goals and to evaluate the impact and safety of fortication In reality, there is usually a wide range of intakes of a nutrient within a popula- tion subgroup. This range of usual intakes must be measured and used as thebasis for planning and evaluation. As previously mentioned, the goal of forti-cation is to shift the distribution of usual nutrient intakes of a target populationupwards so that only a small proportion of the population is at risk of havingan inadequate intake, but not so far that those who consume larger amounts ofthe food vehicle will be at risk of an excessive intake. The median of the newusual intake distribution is referred to as the \"target median intake\". It thusfollows that one of the rst decisions that will need to be made when planningfortication interventions is what is an acceptable prevalence of inadequacy,both for low as well as for high intakes.7.

Assumingthat the nutrient intakes are normally distributed, it is clear from Figure 7.1 that according to this scenario, half of the population subgroup would haveintakes that were below the RNI or RDA, while the intakes of the other halfwould be higher than the RNI (or RDA). More importantly, a relatively large percentage of the population subgroup would have usual intakes below the EAR(28% in this example). A target median intake set at the RNI is now generallyGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 150FIGURE 7.2 An example of a usual intake distribution in which only 2.5% of the group have intakes below the RNI (or RDA) 54 65 Usual intakeFrequency 2.5%Intake distribution 101Median of the Target Intake Distribution EAR RDA Source: adapted from reference ( 333), with the permission of the United States National Academy Press.

Scenario 2 An approach that plans for the usual intakes of all but 2.5% of the group to beabove the RNI (or RDA) is equally unacceptable. For this to happen, the targetmedian intake of the group would need to be set at a very high level, that is tosay, at almost twice the RNI (or RDA). Virtually no intakes would be below theEAR ( Figure 7.2 ). Adopting this approach increases the risk of exceeding the UL (if there is one), and may also result in adverse effects on the organlolepticproperties of foods (due to the relatively high levels of added forticants). Onbalance, such an approach is widely regarded as being unrealistic, costly, inef-cient and potentially risky. Scenario 3 The recommended strategy is thus to shift the usual distribution of intakesupwards so that the intake of each nutrient is at least at the EAR for all except2-3% of the target population group ( Figure 7.3 ). In this example, if the micronutrient interventions are planned so that only 2-3% of the group have anintake less than the EAR, the target median intake would have to be about 1.5times the RNI (or RDA) and approximately 20% of the population group wouldhave intakes below the RNI (or RDA). In other words, the program would besatisfactory when most individuals of the population (97-98%) satisfy the EAR,which may be similar to saying that most individuals of the population satisfy80% of RNI. 7.3.2 Calculating the magnitude of micronutrient additions This is the section of the Guidelines in which the application of the EAR cut- point method to the calculation of fortication levels (i.e. the amount of fortif-icant required to bring about the desired upwards shift in the distribution ofusual intakes) is explained in greater detail.There are four steps: the rst involvesexamining the prevalence of inadequate intakes of each nutrient in specic pop-ulation groups. Having identied which population subgroups have the highestprevalence of inadequate intakes (step 2) and estimated the usual consumptionof the chosen food vehicle by this group (step 3), the nal step is to calculatethe reduction in the prevalence of inadequate intakes (i.e. the proportion belowthe EAR) and the risk of excessive intakes (i.e. the proportion above the UL)that would be expected to occur at different levels of fortication. The method-ology is illustrated with reference to a hypothetical case in which wheat flour isto be fortied with vitamin A.7. DEFINING AND SETTING PROGRAMME GOAL 151Step 1. Observe the usual distribution of nutrient intakes in specic population subgroups As mentioned in section 7.1.3, programme planning requires quantitative dietary intake data, initially for evaluating the current level of nutrient intakes ina population subgroup. This information is also necessary for estimating theamount of micronutrient that would need to be supplied by a micronutrient-delivery programme, and for predicting the impact of adding different amountsof micronutrients to different foods. It is not necessary to conduct large surveys, although intake data should be collected from a stratied, representative sample of the whole target area. Ideally,all population subgroups should be represented. Collecting information fromabout 200 individuals in each population subgroup with the highest risk of de-ciency (e.g. preschool-aged children and reproductive-age women in the lowestrural income group) and the highest risk of excess (e.g. men in the highest urban income group in the case of staple foods), and any other groups that are locallyrelevant, should provide sufcient valid information. It is helpful to select pop-ulation subgroups with similar age ranges as those for which EARs are dened(seeTable 7.2 ). Pregnant and lactating women should usually be treated as sep- arate population subgroups. Quantitative food intake data is usually obtained by 24-hour recall survey techniques or a combination of weighed/measured food intakes and recall,depending on what is locally possible. The distribution of usual intakes obtainedin this way will be unrealistically wide, reflecting the fact that individuals mayeat atypically small or large amounts on the day their intake was measured. Bycollecting at least 2 (preferably non-consecutive) days worth of food intake datafor each individual, it is possible to estimate the day-to-day or intra-individualvariability in intake, and adjust the distribution accordingly. For more detailed information about the statistical techniques that are available for reducing day-to-day variability in dietary intake data, readers are referred to relevant texts onthis subject ( 332,333,336,337 ) 1.If two days of dietary data per person are not available, or cannot be collected for what is felt to be a representative sample of the target population groups, it will then be necessary to use an estimate of day-to-day variability obtained elsewhere, but preferably one that has been obtainedfrom a similar population. A study of the variability in nutrient intakes in a pop-ulation in Malawi has recently been published and may be useful in this regard(338). Allowing for day-to-day variation usually has the effect of narrowing the intake distribution, so that fewer individuals will be below the EAR (and aboveGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 1521The statistical method for reducing variability in intake data described by the Food and Nutri- tion Board of the Institute of Medicine ( 332) is also readable at the following web site: http://www.nap.edu/catalog/9956.html).the UL). If some form of adjustment for variability is not made, the prevalence of inadequacies could be incorrectly estimated because the distribution does notreflect the usual intakes of the individuals in the group. Having collated information on the quantities of various foods consumed, local, regional or international food composition tables can then be used toconvert such data into amounts of nutrients consumed. If local information isnot adequate, there are several international and regional databases that havebeen established expressly for this purpose. The United Nations group,INFOODS 1,is a repository of databases of this type and also serves as a resource for organizations and individuals interested in food composition data. TheINFOODS web site provides links to various software programmes, forexample, the WorldFood Dietary Assessment System 2,which can be used to cal- culate nutrient intakes from one-day dietary information. The results, i.e. thedistribution of usual intake, for each nutrient and for each population group, aredisplayed as percentiles.7. DEFINING AND SETTING PROGRAMME GOAL 153Example Analysis of quantitative food intake survey data, according to the methodology outlined above, reveals that in adult women the distribution of vitamin A intakes is such that the median consumption is 240 \u00b5g RE per day. 5% of adult women have intakes that are less than 120 \u00b5g RE per day and 25% have vitamin A intakes that are below 200 \u00b5g RE per day. See Table 7.4. Step 2. Identify the population subgroups at greatest risk of inadequate intakes of specic micronutrients Certain subgroups of the population (usually children and women) tend to be athigher risk of having an inadequate intake of specic nutrients. On comple- tion of step 1, it will be evident which subgroups have the highest prevalence ofinadequate intakes for which nutrients. It is important to identify which popu-lation groups are at greatest risk so that a micronutrient-delivery programmecan target these groups. 1INFOODS is the acronym of the International Network of Food Data Systems, which was estab- lished in 1984, on the recommendation of an international group convened under the auspicesof the United Nations University. Its goal is to stimulate and coordinate efforts to improve thequality and availability of food analysis data worldwide and to make sure that accurate and reli-able food composition data are readily accessible by all.

This is derived from the FAO/WHO RNI for this vitamin of 500 \u00b5g/day, to which a conversion factor of 1.4 has been applied (see Annex C ). The UL is 3 000 \u00b5g/day. If -carotene were used rather than preformed vitamin A (retinol), there would be no UL.Step 3. Measure the usual amount of the intended food vehicle(s) that is consumed by the population subgroup at greatest risk of inadequate or excessive intakes It is important that food vehicle consumption estimates are obtained not just for those subgroups that have been found to have the highest prevalence of inade-quate intakes in step 2, but also for those subgroups with the highest levels ofconsumption (i.e. those at greatest risk of excessive intakes). This informationwill be used to predict the effects of different levels of fortication on the totalintake of the nutrient (see step 4).7. DEFINING AND SETTING PROGRAMME GOAL 155Example In this example, 65% of adult women were found to have inadequate intakes of vitamin A, i.e. intakes that were below the EAR for this vitamin (357 \u00b5g/day). The proportion of women who were at risk of exceeding the UL (3 000 \u00b5g/d) was very small ( Table 7.4 ). Example Hypothetical values for the usual consumption of wheat by adult women, across the percentiles of vitamin A intake, are included in Table 7.4 . The median con- sumption of wheat is 180g/day. Ideally, the intake of the proposed food vehicleneeds to be higher in the population groups with the highest prevalence of inad-equate intakes, and lower in the relatively well-nourished groups. This would minimize the risk of the vitamin A intakes of the high wheat consumers becom- ing excessive. Unfortunately, in countries in which wheat flour tends to be con-sumed in larger amounts by wealthier (i.e. better-nourished) individuals, this isunlikely to be the case. Although Table 7.4 presents the case for adult women,it is important to point out here that the adult males are usually the group that have the highest consumption of staple foods. Step 4. Simulate the effect of adding different levels of nutrient(s) to the food vehicle Simulating the effect of micronutrient additions (by recalculating the distribu- tion of vitamin A intakes but this time assuming that the wheat flour containsan additional 3 or 5mg/kg vitamin A) helps to identify the most appropriate levelof fortication for a given food vehicle, i.e. a level that prevents deciency in apopulation at risk, yet avoids a high proportion of very high intakes.Step 4 would need to be repeated in order to determine the appropriate forti- cation level for wheat flour with vitamin A for any other at-risk populationgroups identied in step 2. Steps 3 and 4 would then be repeated for any other nutrients being considered for the fortication programme, in which case thecorresponding EARs and current nutrient intake distribution data would beneeded. 7.3.3 Adaptations to the EAR cut-point methodology for specic nutrients 7.3.3.1 Iron The EAR cut-point approach cannot be used to estimate the prevalence of inad- equate iron intakes in some population subgroups, notably children, menstruat-ing adolescents and adult women, on account of the fact that their requirementsfor iron are not normally distributed ( see section 7.2.1 ). The requirements of menstruating adolescents and adult women are not normally distributed largelybecause of the skewed distribution of their iron losses, and of menstrual lossesin particular ( 91). Assuming for present purposes that a coefcient of variation (CV) greater than 40% indicates a skewed distribution, then the populationGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 156Example The data in Table 7.4 show the effect of fortifying all wheat flour with vitamin A (as retinol), at a level of 3 and 5mg/kg, on the distribution of total vitamin Aintakes in adult women, the population subgroup identied as being at high risk of vitamin A deciency. Prior to fortication, the prevalence of inadequateintakes in this group was 65% (see step 2). At a fortication level of 3mg/kg of wheat, the prevalence of inadequate intakes (that is, the proportion of the group with intakes below the EAR of 357 \u00b5g/day) would fall from the pre-fortication level of about 65% (50-75%) to 15% (10-25%). In other words, as a result of fortication, about 50% of adult women have moved from having an inadequate to an adequate vitamin A intake. If thefortication level is increased to 5mg/kg of wheat, only 8% of women wouldhave an inadequate intake. However, at the 5mg/kg fortication level, the highest 6% of wheat consumers would have a total vitamin A intake that might exceed the UL of 3000 \u00b5g/day. Given that calculation does not consider vitamin A intake by adult males,, it may be better to select the 3mg/kg fortication level and then nd another foodvehicle to fortify or another delivery mechanism to meet the shortfall in vitamin A intake in the 15% of women whose intake remains unsatised through the consumption of fortied wheat flour. Decisions of this nature can only be madeon the basis of local information, and with due consideration of the potentialrisks associated with excessive intakes of vitamin A (see section 7.5).groups with skewed requirements for iron are as follows (based on data from the United States FNB/IOM ( =63%). For the other population groups, the CV of the distribution of iron requirements is 30% or less. For those groups with skewed requirements, an alternative approach to the EAR cut-point method must be used, namely a full probability approach. Table 7.5gives the probability of an iron intake being inadequate at a given range of usual iron intake for the population subgroups of interest, i.e. young childrenand menstruating females. Using these values, it is possible to calculate theprevalence of inadequate intakes in a population subgroup from estimates of the percentage of the group with intakes in a given intake range (note that thebioavailability of iron from the usual diet must also be known). For each intakerange, a prevalence of inadequacy is obtained by multiplying the percentage ofthe group with intakes in that range by the probability of inadequacy. Summingthe prevalences of inadequacy in each intake range provides an estimate of thetotal prevalence of inadequacy for the population group of interest . Toillustrate the application of the probability method (using the data in T able 7.5), the prevalence of inadequate iron intakes in a population of adult men-struating women, consuming a diet from which the iron bioavailability is 5%, iscalculated in Table 7.6 .For instance, according to T able 7.5, the women in the lowest iron intake range (i.e. less than 15mg per day) have a probability of inad-equacy of 1.0, which means that all the women in this group have iron intakesthat are less than their requirements. Given that 2% of women in the popula-tion have intakes in this range, these women contribute 2% to the total preva-lence of inadequacy in that population group. Similarly, those women whoseiron intake is in the range 23.6-25.7mg per day will have a probability of aninadequacy of 0.65. If 20% of the women have intakes in this range, the preva-lence of inadequacy among women with intakes in this range is 20 \u00d70.65 or 13% ( Table 7.6 ). When similar calculations are performed for each of the other intake ranges, and then summed, an overall prevalence of inadequacy for thegroup of 66.6% is obtained. In other words, in this example, two thirds of the population of women have intakes that are likely to be below their requirements.Note that such calculations are easily performed with a spreadsheet or a statis-tical programming language.7.

For the purpose of assessing populations, a probabi lity of 1 has been assigned to usual intakes that are below the 2.5th percentile of requirements, and a probability of 0 has been assigned to usual intakes that fall above the 97.5th percentile of requirements. Usual intakes should be adjusted for intra-individual variance as described in section 7.3.2 (step 1). Source: adapted from reference (91).Having established the prevalence of inadequate intakes, the next step is to simulate how the distribution of intakes would shift upwards as a result of theconsumption of iron fortied food(s) (in much the same way as was done insteps 3 and 4 for vitamin A above; see T able 7.4) with a view to nding that levelof fortication that would bring the estimated prevalence of inadequacy downto an acceptable level, say 2-3%. 7.3.3.2 Iodine Based on eld experience,WHO has recommended fortication levels for iodinein salt ( 283). The current recommendation, designed to provide the adult RNI (i.e. 150 \u00b5g/day), is to add 20-40mg iodine/kg salt. This level of fortication assumes no iodine in the usual diet pre-fortication, and that the usual amountof salt consumed is 10g per day.7.

It is generally accepted that women should consume an addi-tional 400 \u00b5g/day as folic acid in fortied foods or supplements periconcep- tionally ( 128). Currently, it is unknown whether the reduction in risk results from the correction of a folate deciency or through some other as yet uniden-tied mechanism. However, increasing intake by just 200 \u00b5g/day through forti- cation has been shown to be effective in improving folate status and in loweringthe prevalence of neural tube defects in both Canada ( 51) and the United States (48,49 ). Based on this evidence, the Pan American Health Organization has rec- ommended that throughout Latin America food fortication interventionsshould provide an additional 200 \u00b5g folic acid per day ( 339). It is anticipated that at these levels of additional intake, the usual daily intake of folic acid plus food folate will exceed the EAR and approach the RNI for the majority of the target population. In any case, it would be appropriate to start with the estima-tion of the nutritional gap for folate, which may be around that value, and hencethe decision will have a nutritional justication. It should be noted that folate intakes are conventionally expressed in units of Dietary Folate Equivalents (DFE), where 1 \u00b5g folate in food is equivalent to 1 DFE. Because of its higher bioavailability, 1 \u00b5g of folic acid actually supplies 1.7 DFE and so less folic acid (the synthetic form of folate that is used as a fortif-icant and in supplements) is required to meet a given requirement for folate(128). 7.3.3.4 Vitamin D Vitamin D is produced in the skin on exposure to ultraviolet light. At latitudes between 42oN and 42oS, 30 minutes of skin exposure per day (arms and face) is usually sufcient to provide the body with all the vitamin D it needs. However,as discussed in section 4.6, several factors inhibit the ability of the body to syn-thesize vitamin D and thus increase the risk of vitamin D deciency. Thesefactors may include living at a more northerly or more southerly latitude (wherethe days are shorter during the winter season), leaving little skin exposed to ultra-violet light, and having dark skin. Any decisions about appropriate levels of vitamin D fortication would need to take exposure to sunlight into account. For instance, in situations where exposure to sunlight is adequate but dietary intake of vitamin D is low,it is quite likely that the risk of vitamin D deciency in a population will be over-estimated if based on intake data alone. For this reason, information on theprevalence of rickets in infants and children, low serum 25-hydroxy vitamin Dconcentrations in the general population, and osteomalacia and/or osteoporosisGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 160in women, should be evaluated when predicting the level of vitamin D forti- cation required. 7.3.3.5 Niacin Niacin (vitamin B 3) is unique in that it can be synthesized from the amino acid, tryptophan (1mg niacin can be generated from approximately 60mg trypto-phan). Thus, similar to the situation with vitamin D, there will appear to be ahigh prevalence of inadequate intakes of the vitamin using only the dietaryintake, both before and after fortication, if non-dietary sources of niacin (i.e.synthesis from tryptophan) are not considered. However, because the rate ofniacin synthesis from tryptophan is not known with certainty, and probablyvaries with life stage and physiological status (e.g. in pregnancy and for young infants), the most practical approach may be to ignore the contribution of tryp-tophan when setting fortication levels. Moreover, the risk of niacin toxicity islow, especially if niacinamide is used as the forticant (see Table 7.3 ). As maize contains niacin in a bound form and is low in tryptophan, popula- tions whose staple food is maize (especially maize that is untreated with alkali)are most likely to benet from niacin fortication (see section 4.4.3). 7.3.4 Bioavailability considerations The methods used to set EARs already include an adjustment for the bioavail- ability (i.e. % absorption) of a nutrient from foods, and so when formulatingfortication levels using the EAR cut-point method there is usually no need tomake any further allowance for this factor. If, however, the bioavailability of theforticant nutrient is likely to be substantially different from that naturallypresent in the diet, some further adjustment will need to be made.The efciencyof utilization of the form of the forticant nutrient may also need to be consid-ered. For example, the conversion rate of synthetic -carotene to retinol in oil is 2:1, but in the absence of oil, the rate is signicantly lower (i.e. 6:1) and theutilization much less efcient. Micronutrients for which differences in bioavailability may be a factor are listed in Table 7.7 .Electrolytic iron, for instance, is poorly absorbed, and it is recommended that this particular form of iron forticant be added at twice thequantity of ferrous sulfate iron, which has a similar bioavailability to non-haemiron in the diet ( Table 5.2 ). In contrast, the absorption of some forticants, such as folic acid and vitamin B 12,maybe substantially higher than their equivalent (i.e. naturally-occurring) forms in foods (see section 7.3.3.3 ). Ideally, the absorption of the forticant nutrient should be conrmed in efcacy trials involving the target population, especially in situations where there is uncertainty about its bioavailability. If this is not possible, then as aminimum, absorption data should be obtained from human studies by other7. DEFINING AND SETTING PROGRAMME GOAL 161investigators, and its bioavailability evaluated once the fortication programme is in place. 7.4 Other factors to consider when deciding fortication levels Experience has shown that in practice, and especially in the case of mass forti-cation, the amount of micronutrient that can be added to foods is often limited byvarious safety, technological and/or economic constraints. Of these three lim- iting factors, cost constraints tend to be the more flexible, whereas safety andtechnological constraints are more likely to be xed. However, for somemicronutrients there may be ways of overcoming some of the technological con-straints. For instance, in the case of iron, undesirable sensory changes in thefood vehicle caused by the presence of the forticant compound might bereduced by using a microencapsulated form of iron instead (see section 5.1.3.3 ). Nor are safety constraints necessarily always cast in stone; with new knowledgeand improvements in the precision of ULs, safety constraints may well changeover time. Table 7.8 assesses the strength of each of the three main types of constraint for the range of micronutrients covered by these Guidelines. The assessment ofthe magnitude of the safety risk is based on the closeness of the EAR to the UL;the closer these two values, the greater the risk. The magnitudes indicated in thistable are subjective and are intended only to highlight those areas that may beof concern for a given micronutrient.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 162TABLE 7.7 Examples of micronutrients for which the bioavailability of the form used for fortication differs substantially from their bioavailability in the usual diet Nutrient/forticant compound Proportion absorbed relative to usual diet Iron Electrolytic iron 0.5 (compared with non-haem iron in foods) NaFeEDTAa3.0 at high phytate, 1.0 at low phytate (compared with non-haem iron in foods) Ferrous bisglycinate 2.0-3.0 (compared with non-haem iron in foods) Vitamin A -caroteneb0.15 from fortied foods in the absence of oil, but 0.5 in oil (compared with retinol) Folate Folic acid 1.7 (compared with Dietary Folate Equivalents of natural food folates) Vitamin B 12 2.0 (compared with cobalamin in foods) aNaFeEDTA, sodium iron ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. bWhen -carotene is added as a food forticant, its bioavailability is higher (the conversion factor -carotene : retinol is 6 : 1 in non-oily foods) than that of naturally-occurring -carotene (in fruits and vegetables), for which the corresponding conversion factor is 12 : 1.7.4.1 Safety limits The safety of fortication can be assessed by comparing predicted micronutri- ent intakes (in particular the intakes that will occur at higher levels of fortica-tion and at higher intakes of fortied foods, calculated as described in section 7.3.2 ) with the UL (Table 7.3) .Even if a micronutrient has no recommended UL, high levels of micronutrient additions should be avoided, especially if thereis no evidence of derived benet from levels of intake in excess of the RNI. 7.4.2 Technological limits The technological limit is dened as the highest possible level of micronutrient addition that does not cause adverse organoleptic changes in the food vehicle.The effects of added micronutrients on the organoleptic properties of the chosenfood vehicle must be tested at an early stage, and alternative forms of the forti-cant used if necessary (see Part III).

Indeed, one of themost important criteria for a successful and sustainable food fortication pro-gramme in free trade economies is a low proportional increase in product price as a result of fortication. This is especially true of mass fortied products. Theissue of cost is usually less of a constraint in the case of targeted and market-driven processed foods, as the price of the product tends to be sufciently highto absorb the costs associated with fortication. Table 7.9 shows the annual investment required to provide an adult male with 100% of his EAR of 14 essential micronutrients, taking into account micronu- trient losses during production, distribution and storage as well as during cooking, and also any variability in the fortication process which might lead toa lowering of the amount of forticant delivered (e.g. uneven mixing). The totalcost for a dry non-oily food, such as wheat flour, is approximately US$ 4.00 peryear, or US$ 0.01 per day. According to these calculations, the most expensive forticants are calcium (because larger amounts are needed), vitamin A, vitaminE and vitamin C (because of overage needed to compensate for losses). Thecheapest - each costing less than US$ 0.02 per year - are thiamine (vitamin B 1), vitamin B 6,folic acid, zinc and iodine. The above cost estimates apply to the large-scale centralized fortication of a staple, i.e. fortication that is carried out in just a few large industrial units.Under such circumstances, the purchase price of the micronutrients accountsfor by far the greatest proportion (at least 80-90%) of the total fortication cost.When fortication is carried out by multiple, smaller-scale enterprises, both theinitial investment costs (e.g. of equipment) and the running costs (e.g. of qualitycontrol procedures) are proportionally higher, a factor which might hinder thefeasibility and sustainability of the programme. Such considerations notwith-standing, in many settings food fortication can be a very affordable way of cor-recting inadequate micronutrient intakes, and more often than not, the mainchallenge is nding a suitable industrially-manufactured food vehicle that is con-sumed in sufcient amounts by the population at risk. 7.5 Adapting the EAR cut-point methodology to mass, targeted and market-driven fortication interventions The EAR cut-point method can be used to select appropriate fortication levels and to estimate their impact on the prevalence of inadequate intakes for all threeGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 1647.

Reduced iron isnot included; its absorption would be at most about half that of electrolytic iron. gAssuming a moderate bioavailability of zinc.types of intervention - mass, targeted and market-driven. However, in each case, there are some unique issues that need to be addressed; these are outlined below. 7.5.1 Mass fortication 7.5.1.1 Setting levels of micronutrient additions Many industrialized and some developing countries have a long history of expe- rience with mass fortication. In many cases, fortication levels were selected empirically, that is to say, were based on a combination of experience elsewhereand technological and cost constraints, rather than on any attempt to derive,in a systematic fashion, fortication levels likely to provide the most benet.This was especially true of situations and settings where food intake data were not available, yet there was a strong desire to move ahead with fortica- tion. However, unless food and nutrient intake data are used as the basis of programme design and evaluation - as described earlier in this chapter - itcannot be known whether those at greatest risk of deciency in a specic nutri-ent (and who have the lowest pre-fortication intakes) will consume enough ofthe fortied food to improve their nutrient intake signicantly, and whether thosewho have the highest pre-fortication intakes will be at risk of excessive intakesafter fortication. Having emphasized the importance of a more rigorous approach to setting fortication levels, it is nevertheless useful to know what fortication levels arealready in use for specic foods in other locations. At the very least, knowledgeof what levels are used elsewhere will provide some guidance as to what levelsof fortication are technologically and economically feasible in which foods.Interestingly, as can be seen from Table 7.10 ,the band of currently used forti- cation levels for each type of food is relatively narrow. It must be stressed thatthe impact of fortication at these levels on nutrient intake and nutritional statushas only been adequately evaluated in a handful of settings and that these levelscannot be recommended universally. Furthermore, fortication levels in use inone location may be inappropriate in another, and should not be used withoutconrming their suitability by using the EAR and UL cut-point method, asdescribed in these Guidelines. 7.5.1.2 Constraints In the case of mass fortication programmes, which tend to rely on staples andcondiments as the food vehicle, cost is often the most signicant limiting factor.Staples and condiments are consumed frequently and in large amounts, not onlybythe population directly but also by food industries. Even small variations in price can thus have profound consequences; opposition to fortied products onthe grounds of cost, can, for example, lead to an increase in deceptive practices,even smuggling.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 1667.

At a per capita consumption of 100gof wheat flour a day, this is equivalent to only US$ 0.182 per year or US$ 0.0005per day per person. Nevertheless, in a country with 10 million consumers, thefortication costs amount to some US$ 5000 per day (US$ 1.825 million peryear). At this cost level, some manufacturers might well be tempted to take that as additional prot rather than add the micronutrients. The cost of fortifying wheat flour with the same micronutrients listed above might increase the price of the flour by US$ 0.30-0.50 per kg, or by 1.0-1.7%relative to that of the unfortied product. Although such increments can beincorporated into the product price, in a free-market economy even small pricedifferentials might be too much to preserve the market share of the fortiedproduct against a non-fortied alternative, especially if the competitive rules arenot equal for all. For example, fortication of salt with 20-40mg iodine/kg usingpotassium iodate costs US$ 1.25 per tonne, or US$ 0.0000125 per day perperson (US$ 0.005 per year per person) assuming a daily consumption of 10gof salt. This equates to around US$ 45 625 per year for a country of 10 millionpersons.Thus, although the absolute annual investment is relatively low, this rep-resents an increment in price of 2% over raw salt (assuming the price of salt isUS$ 0.06 per kg). Even this modest price increment is disliked by many smallproducers who fear loss of their market share to the extent that they would avoidadding iodine if not for strict governmental enforcement. Herein lies the reasonwhy salt is currently not more widely used as a vehicle for other micronutrients,even if their addition were technically feasible and biologically efcacious. If,however, mechanisms to overcome impediments of this nature, such as subsi-dies or effective and reliable enforcement mechanisms, were to be devised, saltmay yet become a more attractive option as a vehicle for mass fortication. Saltcould also be used in targeted programmes, where price increases due to thecost of fortication tend to be less limiting. In summary, experience dictates that a mass fortication in an open market economy works best when the increase in the price of the fortied product, rel-ative to the unfortied version, does not exceed 1-2%. However, this is by no means a universal prescription and any decisions relating to cost limits can onlybe taken by government and industry depending on the situation in any givencountry. Annex D describes a procedure that can be used for setting Feasible Forti- cation Levels for mass fortication programmes based on consideration ofsafety, technological and cost constraints. If the combined effect of these con-straints is to reduce the amount of nutrient that can be added to below thatwhich is required to achieve a given intake goal, then more than one food mayGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 168need to be fortied or some nutrients may have to be supplied through other strategies, such as supplementation. 7.5.2 Targeted fortication With targeted fortication, the various constraints on micronutrient additions are generally less restrictive than those that operate in the case of food productssubject to mass fortication. Not only is the target group more clearly dened(refugees, displaced persons and young children are usually the main beneci-aries), but the fortied foods are usually in their nal form or are offered indened serving sizes, so that the risk of exceeding ULs is reduced. In addition,the presentation and sensory properties of foods selected for targeted fortica-tion are such that any changes introduced by the addition of micronutrients aremore easily hidden, and the cost of fortication is usually compatible with theprice of the product or partly borne by the nancial supporters of the pro-gramme .Nevertheless, it is always instructive to assess technological compati- bility and overall cost of targeted fortied foods at the programme planning stage. 7.5.2.1 Blended foods Guidelines covering the fortication of blended foods for refugees and displacedpersons are available elsewhere ( 62) and thus are not discussed in detail here. 7.5.2.2 Complementary foods That the micronutrient content of breast milk may be considerably lower in undernourished women is a concern in several parts of the world. Nutrientsmost likely to be reduced in the breast milk of undernourished mothers includevitamin A, all B vitamins except folate, iodine and selenium. The fortication ofcomplementary foods thus provides a means of supplying additional nutrientsto infants and children who are still receiving breast milk. However, becauseinfants and young children also require their diets to have a high nutrient density (i.e. a high concentration of nutrient per kcal), in some settings it may be dif- cult to achieve a low risk of inadequate nutrient intakes even when comple-mentary foods are fortied. The process of setting the level of fortication for complementary foods is similar to that described earlier in this chapter (see section 7.3.2). The startingpoint is again the distribution of usual intakes, although in this case is it neces-sary to consider the intakes from both breast milk and complementary foods foreach nutrient being studied. Breast-milk intakes can be estimated from publishedinformation on the composition of breast milk (such as that published by WHO,which includes data from both industrialized and developing countries ( 340),7. DEFINING AND SETTING PROGRAMME GOAL 169and intakes from other sources can be collected using 24-hour recall methods for a representative sample of the group of interest. Having obtained the relevant intake data, the procedure for setting fortica- tion levels is then much the same as previously, the steps being as follows: Step 1. Determine the prevalence of intakes that are below the EAR First, review the intake distributions and determine the prevalence of intakes thatare below the EAR; decide if this level of inadequate intakes is acceptable. If itis not, then fortication of complementary foods could be considered. Step 2. Decide what level of prevalence of inadequate intakes is acceptable Next, decide on an acceptable prevalence of inadequacy (i.e. the percentage of the children with intakes below the EAR). Often 2-3% is taken to be themaximum desirable prevalence of inadequate intakes. Then determine the levelof fortication that will move the prevalence of inadequacy down to this accept-able level. Step 3. Select a food vehicle Choose the most appropriate vehicle for fortication, i.e. the one that will reachmost of the children, or will reach those with the greatest need. Step 4. Simulate the impact of fortication Finally, calculate through simulation the likely impact of fortication of thechosen food vehicle on the prevalence of inadequate intakes and proportion ofintakes that are in excess of the UL. With the exception of iron and zinc, EARs are not dened for infants aged 0-12 months. For this age group, recommended intakes are expressed in termsof Adequate Intakes (AIs), in which case the nutritional goal of a fortication pro-gramme would be the raising of the mean intake of the target group to the AI. Simpler alternative approaches to setting fortication levels for complemen- tary foods do, however, exist. One option is to estimate the size of the gapbetween the usual median intake and the recommended intake (either the EARor the AI, depending on the nutrient of interest); this then equates to the amountof micronutrient that needs to be added in order to achieve the desired nutri-tional goal. Dividing the nutritional gap by the daily amount of food consumedgives the amount of micronutrient that needs to be supplied per gram of the fortied food 1.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 1701The fortication level is more conventionally expressed as an amount per 100 g or per serving size (i.e. the amount per gram multiplied by the average serving size, usually 40 g).The other option, which is the easier of the two because there is no need for intake data, is to simply add a specic proportion of the EAR (or AI) of thetarget group in the hope that by so doing the nutritional needs of the majority of the children will be met. Again it is necessary to know how much of a givencomplementary food is consumed per day, and also what the usual serving sizesare in order to derive a fortication level per 100g of product or per servingsize. The Codex Alimentarius Commission provides recommendations for the composition of certain foods designated for infants and young children. Theseare subject to a process of continual review and are regularly revised. In the caseof supplementary foods for older infants and young children, when the food issupplemented with specic nutrients, the Codex recommendation is to add atleast two thirds of the reference daily requirement per 100g of food ( 341). In practice, this means that if an average serving size for this age group is around40g, each serving should provide between 30% and 50% of the EAR in orderto satisfy the daily nutrient needs in 2 to 3 servings a day. Obviously, if detaileddietary information is available, the micronutrient content of complementaryfoods might be adjusted to the exact characteristics and needs of the targetgroup. 7.5.3 Market-driven fortication Food manufacturers add micronutrients to their products not just to increase their nutritional value but also to increase their appeal to the health consciousconsumer. This business-oriented initiative can play a positive role in publichealth by improving the supply of essential nutrients that are sometimes dif-cult to provide in sufcient amounts via mass fortication. So far, the publichealth impact of fortication of market-driven processed foods has been verymodest in developing countries but its importance is expected to be greater inthe future, largely as a natural consequence of increasing urbanization and avail-ability of such foods. The main aim of regulating the level of forticants in processed foods is pre- serving the nutritional balance and safety of the diet for the population at large.Tothis end, minimum levels need to be set to ensure that reasonable amounts of micronutrients are added to food products; these must be stated on theproduct label, and may be referred to when advertising the product. It is impor-tant to also x maximum levels so as to reduce the risk of an excessive nutrientintake through the consumption of fortied foods, especially for those micronu-trients with well-established UL values (see Chapter 11). It may also be desir-able to regulate which foods can be fortied (see section 7.5.3.3).7. DEFINING AND SETTING PROGRAMME GOAL 1717.5.3.1 Nutritional Reference Values (NRVs) Guidelines on nutrition labelling that are applicable to all foods including forti- ed foods have been produced by the Codex Alimentarius Commission ( 342). In an attempt to harmonize the labelling of foods with respect to their nutrientcontents, the Codex guidelines dene a set of Nutrient Reference Values(NRVs), which are based on the FAO/WHO RNI values for adult males, as areference for the general populaition. Unlike RNIs, NRVs are not given for spe-cic age or physiological groups but are designed to apply to all family membersaged over 3 years. The current NRVs (see Table 7.11 ) are based on the 1996 FAO/WHO RNI values ( 210), and will be adjusted in accordance with the more recent RNI values published by the FAO/WHO ( 93).GUIDELINES ON FOOD NRVaFAO/WHO RNI for adult malesb Calcium (mg) 800 1 000 Iodine ( \u00b5g) 150 150 Iron (mg) 14 13.7Magnesium (mg) 300 260Selenium ( \u00b5g) - 34 Zinc (mg) 15 7Biotin ( - 30 Vitamin B 6(mg) 2 1.3 Folateb(\u00b5g DFE) 200 400 Vitamin B 12(\u00b5g) 1 2.4 Niacin (vitamin B 3) (mg) 18 16 Riboflavin (vitamin B 2) (mg) 1.6 1.3 Thiamine (vitamin B 1) (mg) 1.4 1.2 Vitamin C (mg) 60 45 Vitamin Ad(\u00b5g RE) 800 600 Vitamin De(\u00b5g) 5 5 Vitamin E ( -tocopherol) (mg) - 10.0 aThe Nutrient Reference Value (NRV) dietary reference value dened by the Codex Ali- mentarius Commission for the purposes of harmonizing the nutrition labeling of processedfoods and used as a reference for the general population ( 342). bThe FAO/WHO RNIs listed here are those published in 1996 ( 210), some of which have since been revised. =Dietary dRE=retinol ).7.5.3.2 Setting safe maximum limits for market-driven fortication of processed foods The fact that market-driven fortied processed foods are usually marketed to all family members, rather than to specic age or physiological groups, presentsa number of difculties in terms of setting maximum limits on the permittedlevels of forticants in such foods. The difculties are compounded by the factthat the same serving size of the fortied food (breakfast cereals, beverages andnutritional bars, for example) is common to all members of the family. Theproblem therefore arises that by using maximum limits that are based on theNRVs (i.e. RNIs of adult males; see section 7.5.3.1), unnecessarily largeamounts of micronutrients may be delivered to children by fortied foods .In this context, it is worth noting that, for some micronutrients (vitamin A, niacinas nicotinic acid, folate, zinc, calcium and iodine), the UL for children below 8years of age is very close to the EAR for adult males (see Tables 7.2 and 7.3 ). Establishing maximum levels for nutrient additions that take into account the above safety concerns thus requires adopting some form of risk assessmentappraisal. Such approaches base the calculation of a safe maximum limit onaccepted values of the UL for the most vulnerable groups, which in this caseare children in the age group 4-8 years. Then, assuming that the amounts ofmicronutrients provided by the diet and via ongoing mass fortication pro-grammes are known, the maximum micronutrient content per serving size of a market-driven fortied processed food is given by the following equation (a): In order to apply this equation, it is necessary to estimate the number of serv- ings of processed foods that are consumed. This can done as follows: The usual serving size for solid foods is generally assumed to be 50g and that for beverages, 250ml after reconstitution to liquid. However, for the purposesof this derivation it is better to dene the serving size in terms of energy (i.e. inkcal) in order to preserve the nutritional balance of the diet. Table 7.12 sum- marizes the usual energy densities of a variety of commercially-available foods,from which it can be seen that the smallest dietary serving size is 40 kcal. Thus,a serving of solid foods (50g) contains 5 dietary servings, a serving of milk orcereal-based beverages, 6 dietary servings, and sugar-based beverages, 1 dietaryserving. 7. DEFINING AND SETTING PROGRAMME GOAL 173If it is assumed that 30% of an individual's daily energy intake (2000 kcal) is derived from fortied processed foods, the amount of energy provided by thesefoods would be: 2000kcal \u00d70.3=600kcal. In terms of the number of the smallest dietary serving size, expressed as an energy density (i.e. 40kcal), this amount of energy equates to: 600kcal/40kcal =15 servings. Thus, the previous equation can be transformed as follows: Box 7.3 illustrates the use of this procedure for milk and sugar-based beverages. Under normal circumstances, and after considering nutrient amounts sup- plied by the diet, it is unlikely that the maximum safe limits per usual servingsize for the nutrients mentioned in Table 7.13 ( with the exception of calcium) will be in excess of 30% of the RNI in the case of solid foods and milk- or cereal-based beverages and in excess of 15% of the RNI in the case of sugar-basedbeverages. 7.5.3.3 Keeping the nutritional balance Some micronutrients were intentionally omitted from the discussion in the pre-ceding section, because either they do not have a recognized UL (health risks GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 174TABLE 7.12 Energy densities of common food presentations Food presentation Usual serving Energy density Energy density per 100 g size per serving or 100 ml Solid 50 g 160 kcal 320 kcal Milk or cereal-based 250 ml 200 kcal 80 kcal beverages Sugar-based beverages 250 ml 100 kcal 40 kcalhave not, as yet, been identied), or their UL is high enough to not to raise serious concerns about the safety of high intakes from fortied foods. However,in the interests of maintaining an adequate balance in the diet, it is recommendedthat these other nutrients be added to processed fortied foods in roughly thesame proportion as those micronutrients for which large intakes are undesirable.In practice this means limiting micronutrient additions to between 15% and 30%of the adult RNI in the case of solid foods and milk- or cereal-based beverages,and to half of these values (i.e. 7.5-15%) in the case of sugar-based beverages.7. DEFINING AND SETTING PROGRAMME GOAL 175BOX7.3 Example:settingmaximumsafelevelsfortheforticationof milkandsugar-basedbeverageswithvitaminA 1. Milk A milk beverage is to be fortied with vitamin A. The fortied product is aimed at a population in which the daily intake of retinol (preformed vitamin A) through the diet and from ongoing mass fortication programmes by children is approx- imately 300 \u00b5g. Given that the UL for vitamin A in children aged 4-8 years is 900 \u00b5g (Table 7.3 ). the maximum content of vitamin A per 40kcal serving size will be: (900 300\u00b5g vitamin A)/15 servings =40\u00b5g vitamin A/serving. By using the relevant conversion factor ( Table 7.14) , we can calculate the maximum safe vitamin A content for a 250ml serving of milk, as follows: 40\u00b5g vitamin A \u00d75.0=200\u00b5g vitamin A. Expressed as a percentage of the adult male RNI (see Table 7.1 ), the maximum vitamin A content of a 250ml serving of the fortied milk is: 200/600 \u00d7100 =33%, and expressed as a percentage of the current NRV (see Table 7.11 ), the maximum vitamin A content of a the same sized serving of milk is: 200/800 \u00d7100 =25%. 2. Sugar-based beverages A similar calculation for a sugar-based beverage yields a maximum vitamin A content of 100 \u00b5g (i.e. 40 \u00b5g\u00d72.5) per 250ml of beverage (or reconstituted powder), which represents 17% of the adult male RNI and 12.5% of the currentNRV for this vitamin.These recommendations are in line with Codex guidelines on nutrition claims and their use, which are only expressed in terms of percentage of the NRVserving for minerals and vitamins (see section 7.5.3.1 ). The Codex Guidelines for Use of Nutrition Claims ( 343) stipulate that a food can only be described as a \"source\" of a specic nutrient if it supplies 15% of the NRV per usualserving, (or 15% of the NRV per 100g (solid food), or 5% of the NRV per 100ml (liquid food), or 5% of the NRV per 100kcal). In order to qualify as being \"high\" in a specic nutrient, a food product must contain twice as much of the nutrient as a \"source\" does. It means that many foods could beclassied as a \"source\", but very few products - mostly those naturally rich inmicronutrients - could be classied as \"high\" in specic micronutrients.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 176TABLE 7.14 Factors for converting maximum micronutrient amounts per 40kcal-sized servings to maximum amounts for different food presentations and serving sizes Food presentation Usual serving size Conversion factor Per usual serving size Per 100 g or 100 ml Solid 50 g 4.0 8.0 Milk or cereal-based 250 ml 5.0 2.0 beverages Sugar-based beverages 250 ml 2.5 1.0TABLE 7.13 Calculated maximum micronutrient contentaper 40kcal-sized serving, assuming no other sources of micronutrient in the diet NutrientbUL (children aged Maximum amount 4-8 years) Per 40 kcal serving As a % of the RNIc Vitamin A (as retinol) ( \u00b5g \u00b5g1 0 Niacin nicotinic acidd) (mg) 15 mg 1.0 mg 6 Folic acid (mg) 400 \u00b5g2 7 \u00b5g7 Iron (mg) 40 mg 3 mg 22Zinc (mg) 12 mg 0.6 mg 4Calcium (mg) 2 500 mg 167 mg 17Iodine ( \u00b5g) 300 \u00b5g2 0 \u00b5g1 3 Intake Limit; RNI, Recommended Nutrient Intake. aMaximum levels listed here should be reduced by an amount proportional to the amount of nutrient supplied by the diet (including though mandatory mass fortication programmes). bThere are other micronutrients with UL values, but they are not included here because it wouldbe very difcult to approach the UL through the consumption of fortied foods. cAs a percentage of the RNI for adult males. dNiacinamide can be used without this restriction.It is generally recommended that nutrient content claims be restricted in accordance with these rules, even if the food product contains - for technolog-ical purposes or naturally - more than 30% of the NRV . Claims based on per- centages in excess of 30% of the NRV in a given fortied food should bediscouraged, on the grounds that such claims might mislead consumers as towhat constitutes a properly balanced diet. Summary Authorities taking the decision to launch a micronutrient fortication programme should not do so without collecting food and nutrient intake data, supported by various ancillary information, especially, biochemical data on nutritional status. Such data are necessary to make an informed judgment about the types and amountsof specic nutrients to add to which foods. Given the long-term effort and invest-ment that is needed to implement and sustain fortication programmes, and the need to protect individuals in populations consuming the fortied foods, both for deciencies as well as for excesses, an initial investment in collecting adequatefood intake data is highly recommended. \u2014Biochemical and clinical data can reveal which micronutrients are insufcient in the usual diet and indicate the prevalence and severity of specic micronutrient deciencies in different population groups. \u2014Information on the distribution of usual dietary intakes of nutrients within popu- lation groups provides the most useful basis on which to justify and design a micronutrient fortication programme to correct micronutrient deciencies. \u2014Knowledge of dietary patterns, although useful, is not sufcient information for making nal decisions about which nutrients to add to which foods, and howmuch of each nutrient to add. The amount of micronutrient added to the diet through food fortication should be designed such that the predicted probability of inadequate intakes of that specic nutrient is 2.5% for population subgroups of concern, while avoiding risk of exces- sive intakes in other subgroups of the population. Due to technological, safety and cost constraints, it may not be possible to add the amount of nutrient(s) needed to ensure adequate intakes in almost all members of a population by mass fortication. In that case, fortication of several food vehicles, other types of fortication, or supplementation, should be considered. While these Guidelines provide information on the rationale for fortication and the implementation of fortication programmes, the nal decisions concerning which micronutrients to prioritize in a specic location should be made on the basis of local information and public health priorities.7. DEFINING AND SETTING PROGRAMME GOAL 177CHAPTER 8 Monitoring and evaluation Monitoring and evaluation are essential components of any food fortication programme, systems for which should be developed at the outset of a pro-gramme, ideally during the design and planning stages. Monitoring and evalu- ation provide an opportunity not only to assess the quality of the implementation and delivery of a programme, but also the degree to which it reaches its targetedhouseholds and individuals, and achieves its nutritional goals. More importantly,the results of monitoring and evaluation exercises provide programme planners and policy-makers with the necessary information to make decisions about whether to continue, expand, replicate or end a programme. 8.1 Basic concepts and denitions For a fortication programme to be effective, the chosen food vehicles have to be available nationwide or, at least, in the specic geographical areas targeted bythe programme. In practice, this means that the product must be available topurchase from local retail stores or outlets that are accessible to the targeted seg-ments of the population. Furthermore, the fortied products have to be pur-chased by the target families, and consumed with sufcient frequency and inappropriate amounts by the targeted individuals. Throughout this process, thatis to say, from the factory to the retail stores, and right up until the time of con-sumption by targeted individuals, it is vital that the product maintains itsexpected quality. Thus to ensure that the planned impact is achieved, a pro-gramme's operational performance (orimplementation efciency ) must be moni- tored; this is best accomplished through a system of continuous data collectionatkey delivery points. When bottlenecks or operational inefciencies are identi- ed, information must be directed to the programme entity responsible forimplementing remedial actions and for re-directing the programme as needed.This set of actions constitutes programme monitoring . In the context of food fortication, the term \"monitoring\" thus refers to the continuous collection, review and use of information on programme imple-mentation activities, for the purpose of identifying problems, such as non-compliance, and informing corrective actions so as to full stated objectives ( 6). The ultimate purpose of monitoring a fortication programme is to ensure that 178the fortied product, of the desired quality, is made available and is accessible to consumers in sufcient amounts. The term \"evaluation\" on the other hand is used to refer to the assessment of the effectiveness and the impact of a programme on the target population. Inthe case of food fortication, evaluations are undertaken with the aim of pro-viding evidence that the programme is indeed reaching its nutritional goals, bethis an increase in the intake of a fortied food or of specic nutrients, or animprovement in the nutritional status, health or functional outcomes of the targetpopulation. Programme evaluation should not be undertaken until a programme has been shown - through appropriate monitoring - that it has been imple-mented as planned, and is operating efciently. A poorly implemented pro-gramme is unlikely to achieve its desired impact, and thus, resources should not be wasted in undertaking evaluations until programme operational inefciencieshave been corrected. A schematic representation of a model monitoring and evaluation system for fortication programmes is shown in Figure 8.1 ;this model provides a frame- work for the various monitoring and evaluation activities that are described in this chapter. The framework model distinguishes two main categories of monitoring, reg- ulatory monitoring andhousehold/individual monitoring .The former, regulatory monitoring, encompasses all monitoring activities conducted at the productionlevel (i.e. at factories, packers), as well as monitoring at customs warehouses and8.

Production level regulatory mon-itoring comprises both internal andexternal monitoring; regulatory monitoring atthe retail level is referred to here as commercial monitoring .The primary aim of regulatory monitoring is to ensure that the fortied foods meet the nutrient,quality and safety standards set prior to programme implementation. The other category, household/individual monitoring, as its name implies, involves households and their members and has the following objectives(adapted from Habicht et al. ( 344): \u2014to ensure that targeted individuals and households have access to the for- tied food and that the fortied food is of the expected quality (i.e. tomeasure service provision ); \u2014to ensure that targeted individuals and households purchase and consume the fortied food (i.e. to monitor service utilization ); \u2014to ensure that targeted individuals and households consume the fortied food in appropriate amounts and frequency (i.e. to measure coverage). Once regulatory and household monitoring have demonstrated that the pro- gramme is operating in a satisfactory manner, evaluation of the programme at the household and at the individual level can be undertaken to assess its impact.This is generally referred to as impact evaluation (Figure 8.1 ) Some of the data obtained through household monitoring, for example, data on consumption offortied foods and/or micronutrient intakes, can also be used in programmeevaluation (see section 8.4). Table 8.1 summarizes the key features of each of the three principal frame- work components of monitoring and evaluation identied above, i.e. regulatory monitoring, household monitoring and impact evaluation.The remainder of thischapter is devoted to discussing each of these components in more detail andconcludes by outlining the minimum requirements for a monitoring and evalu-ation system for a fortication programme (section 8.5). 8.2 Regulatory monitoring As shown in Figure 8.1 ,regulatory monitoring comprises three parts - internal monitoring, external monitoring and commercial monitoring: Internal monitoring refers to the quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA) practices conducted by producers, importers and packers. External monitoring refers to the inspection and auditing activities carried out atproduction centres (factories and packers) and importation custom sites. Governmental authorities are responsible for external monitoring, which isGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 1808.

Commercial monitoring is similar to external monitoring in that it is generally the responsibility of the government and its purpose is to verify that the for-tied products comply with standards, but is conducted at the level of retailstores . For each stage of the monitoring process, it is helpful to establish indicators that can be used to measure success. In the case of fortication programmes, successcriteria can be expressed in terms of the proportion of samples containing aspecied minimum amount of a given nutrient at various stages in the lifecycleof the product, i.e. at the time of production (the Production Minimum), at thepoint of sale (the Retail or Legal Minimum) and at the point of consumption(the Household Minimum). A sample set of success criteria for monitoring pur-poses are presented in Table 8.2. Tobe effective, a monitoring system requires a set of established procedures, methodologies and reporting requirements, all of which make a contribution to ensuring the continuous assessment of a programme. A clear delineation ofresponsibilities and an efcient feedback mechanism, which facilitate the estab-lishment and implementation of corrective measures when operational problemsarise, are also essential. Table 8.3 (345) outlines how some of these facets ofGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 182TABLE 8.2 Suggested criteria for measuring success at various monitoring stages for food fortication programmes (expressed as a percentage of samples that must comply with minimum levels and Maximum Tolerable Levels) Monitoring Minimum levels Maximum stage Tolerable HouseholdaRetailbProductioncLeveld Internal 100 100 80 <20 External (inspection) 100 80 - <20 Household 90 - - <10 aThe Household Minimum Level is the amount of nutrient that must be present in the food at the household level before being used in meal preparation. This value is estimated to reacha nutritional goal after considering losses during food preparation (specic additional intakeof certain nutrients). bThe Retail Minimum Level (or the Legal Minimum Level) is the nutrient content of the fortiedfood at retail locations at the moment of sale. Usually it is 20-30% larger for vitamins andiodine, and 3-5% larger for minerals, than the Household Minimum Level. cThe Production Minimum Level is the nutrient content of the fortied food in the factory, whichconsiders an overage for losses occurring during production, distribution and storage. It isthe decision of the manufacturer/importer which overage to use to ensure that the productretains the Retail Minimum Level during the duration of its commercial life. dThe Maximum Tolerable Level (MTL )is the maximum allowed content of a specic micro- nutrient in a fortied food to assure that none of the consumers receives an amount near tothe Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL).8.

Table 8.3 lists an additional monitoring stage, namely quality audits for eval- uation of conformity. This is the formal examination and testing of a batch of afortied food product for compliance with standards. It should be reserved forspecial circumstances, which can either be when intentional non-conformity issuspected (and legal action is required) or when certication of a production lotprior to exportation is necessary. 8.2.1 Internal monitoring (quality control/quality assurance) Broadly speaking, quality assurance (QA) refers to the implementation of planned and systematic activities necessary to ensure that products or servicesmeet quality standards. The performance of quality assurance can be expressednumerically in terms of the results of quality control procedures. Quality control (QC) is dened as the techniques and assessments used to document compli- ance with established technical standards, through the use of objective and meas- urable indicators that are applicable to the products or services. Detailed information about QC/QA can be found in any one of the many technical manuals that are devoted to this subject and in publications on goodmanufacturing practice (GMP) ( 346). In these Guidelines the topic of QA/QC is viewed from a purely public health perspective and focuses on indicators andcriteria that are relevant to the process of food fortication. Thus in the contextof food fortication, quality assurance consists of establishing the following procedures: \u2014obtain from the providers a certicate of quality 1for any micronutrient mixes used; \u2014request, receive and store in a systematic, programmed and timely manner the ingredients and supplies for the preparation of a preblend2; \u2014produce the preblend according to a schedule that is adjusted to the rate of food manufacturing and fortication; \u2014control the adequate performance of the preblend equipment; \u2014appropriately label and deliver the preblend;GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 1861The micronutrient mixes must be accompanied by a document that certies their nutrient content. This is usually the case for products shipped by international companies dedicated to this task. 2Apreblend is the combination of the micronutrient mix with another ingredient, often the same food that is to be fortied, with the purpose of reducing the dilution proportion and improvingthe distribution of the micronutrient mix in the food and guaranteeing that there will be not beseparation (segregation) between the food and micronutrient particles.\u2014use the preblend in the same order of production (i.e. rst in, rst out); \u2014verify appropriate functioning of the feeder machines and the mixers in a continuous and systematic manner; \u2014ensure that the product is adequately packaged, labelled, stored and shipped. It is possible that other process variables, such as pH and temperature/time exposure, could affect the stability of added micronutrients and should also beconsidered in the design of quality assurance programmes. The quality control procedures will typically consist of taking samples of the fortied food, either by batch or in a continuous manner depending on thesystem of production, and determining their micronutrient content. Irrespectiveof the sampling method, the number of samples required will be governed bythe consistency and reliability of the fortication process. A highly homogeneousand consistent operation, regardless of the size of the batch or the rate of pro-duction, will need less sampling than one with variable results. Nevertheless,even in the most reproducible conditions it is important to take and analysesamples routinely in order to verify and keep track of whether the technical stan-dards are being met. Figure 8.2 illustrates the features of a dynamic sampling system suitable for a continuous production process. Under optimal operation, one sample of aproduct per 8-hour shift might be sufcient; this would be categorized as arelaxed intensity of sampling. If the technical specications of the product are not attained (i.e. the micronutrient content is lower than the factory minimumor higher than the Maximum T olerable Level), then sampling frequency should8.

In a \"normal\" situation, if 2 out of 5 consecutive samples of theproduct fail to meet the technical requirements, then the intensity of sampling should be changed to a demanding intensity, and corrective actions implemented. Again, if 2 out of 5 consecutive samples do not achieve the technical require-ments, then the production should be stopped until the source of error is foundand the necessary corrective measures introduced. When production is reinitiated, sampling should start at the demanding inten- sity, be switched to a normal and then back down to a relaxed intensity if, eachtime, three consecutive samples satisfy technical requirements. The relaxed sit-uation implies a degree of consumer risk; if sampling is infrequent, there is agreater chance of some non-compliant batches reaching the market. When sam- pling is frequent (i.e. as in the demanding situation), the likelihood of detectingeven a minor deviation from the standard is increased, and prompts producersto expend time and resources in the resolution of the problem (the producer'srisk). Neither the relaxed nor the normal sampling intensity should be viewed as positive or negative; they simply reflect the performance of the forticationprocess at the moment of the assessment. Results of QC must be carefullyrecorded and kept, because they document the history of the efciency and alsothe producer's supervision of the fortication process. Because results are needed quickly (so that corrective actions can be imple- mented promptly), QC procedures demand fast and simple analytical assays.These assays do not necessarily need to have high analytical resolution (i.e. beable to discriminate between small concentration ranges), but it is essential thatthey are able to determine whether fortication standards are being met (i.e.micronutrient content not less than the production minimum nor more than theMaximum T olerable Level). In this regard, semi-quantitative assays are poten-tially very useful and attempts have been made in recent years to develop testkits based on semi-quantitative assays. T est kits for the measurement of iodinein salt, for example, have been developed but, to date, have met with limitedsuccess; those currently on the market, have been found to be of questionablereliability ( 347). Clearly, further research is needed in this area before semi- quantitative tests can be applied more widely in the food industry. 8.2.2 External monitoring (inspection and technical auditing) Some form of external monitoring by governmental food control authorities is essential to assure that producers are complying with the approved technicalstandards that ensure the quality and safety of food fortication. Awareness thattheir product might be checked at any time usually provides producers with astrong motivational force to carry out an acceptable production process with the appropriate QA/QC procedures. In industrialized countries, it is usually GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 188sufcient to conrm once a year (or even less frequently) the nutrient content indicated on the food labels from samples taken in the market (see Commercialmonitoring, section 8.2.3). However, in much of the developing world, where it is very difcult to trace and to retrieve a defective batch once a food productreaches retail stores, it is advisable to also conduct external monitoring at thefactory level. External monitoring combines two types of actions: checking the performance and the records of the producers' quality assur- ance procedures ( technical auditing ); conrming that the technical specications for the product are being met at factories, packaging sites and points of entry into the country ( inspection ). Ideally, inspection and verication of legal compliance should be based on the analytical assessment of the micronutrient content of a food product by meansof a quantitative assay. All samples should contain the forticant; at least 80%of samples from factories, importation sites and warehouses should present theLegal Minimum amount, and less than 20% of samples should have a micronu-trient content that is above but always near the Maximum T olerable Level ( Table 8.2). If this is found not to be the case, then more frequent visits to the factory to carry out technical auditing and inspection activities are justied (seeFigure 8.2 ). Imported products should be treated in a similar manner to locally produced foods, only instead of checking the producers' documented AQ/QC procedures,the certicate of conformity provided by the country of origin should be exam-ined. However, food control authorities can corroborate compliance of the tech-nical standards in samples of the imported shipments. The intensity of sampling and factory inspection frequency depends on the reproducibility of the fortication process and should be determined for eachtype of industry under the specic conditions of each country. For example, forsalt fortication by small industries this might be every 15 days, for sugar indus-tries every month, and for wheat flour industries every 6 months. In theory, sam-pling should follow a statistically based approach, such as that recommended bythe Codex Alimentarius Commission ( 345). In practice, however, the number of samples and the analytical work required can overwhelm the available human,nancial and material resources of the food control entities in many developingcountries. For day-to-day monitoring and routine inspection visits, the Codexsampling procedures are often impractical and unrealistic and are thus bestreserved for situations that require a quality audit for evaluation of conformity(e.g. for cases when the product requires a certicate of conformity for ex-portation, or if there is a legal controversy that might lead to serious penalties)(See Table 8.3 ).8. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 189A simpler, low-cost monitoring system, based on the concept of corroborating tests, has been successfully adopted by some countries in Central America.These tests consist of checking compliance with fortication standards in a smallnumber of samples (e.g. 5-10 product samples from factories) during themoment of the technical auditing visit; samples are taken from the productionline and also from storage areas. At least 80% of the samples should contain theLegal Minimum of the micronutrient, and less than 20% should be above, butnever too far from the Maximum T olerable Level. If these criteria are not ful-lled, then a warning statement must be provided and more frequent visits fortechnical auditing and inspection should be planned to the factories responsiblefor the product. In extreme cases, a quality audit for evaluation of conformitymight be necessary ( Table 8.3 ). The concept of corroborating tests is based on the principle that quality is the main responsibility of producers; governmentalauthorities only act to represent the public, and to guarantee that monitoring isindeed carried out. 8.2.3 Commercial monitoring As is the case for any other industrially produced food, fortied foods, irre- spective of whether fortication is voluntary or in response to public health inter-est, must be correctly identied with a label. A label should include at least thebrand of the product, the address of the responsible entity, and the LegalMinimum Level of the nutrient and, if industry development allows, also thedate of minimum durability, the batch number and the production date. As mentioned in the previous section, in industrialized countries external reg- ulatory monitoring is generally limited to a conrmation of micronutrientcontent and label claims in samples obtained from retail stores. In the event ofa breach of standards, mechanisms exist for the recall of defective products andretraction of misleading claims. Strict governmental enforcement of regulationsand stiff penalties for non-compliance, means that it is very rare for a producerto take the risk of not complying with regulations and on the whole, the proce-dure works well. In the developing world, as indicated previously, it is not alwayspossible to trace and retrieve a defective batch once a food product reaches themarket place, and so it is necessary to monitor for compliance with quality standards and label claims at the both the factory and retail levels (see alsosection 8.2.2). In many settings, especially in the developing world, commercial monitoring can be particularly useful for identifying brands and factories that deserve closerauditing. A system based on the use of corroborating tests, as suggested for fac-tories above, can equally well be applied to the commercial setting; one or twosamples of each brand from each store might be used to check for standard com-pliance. If anomalies are found, then a technical comprehensive auditing of theGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 190responsible factory or importation rm would be warranted. Semi-quantitative assays to detect the presence of micronutrients might be useful for monitoringatretail stores, and as an enforcement tool at the local level. However, any legal action must be based on results obtained from quantitative assays carried out aspart of a quality auditing visit to the responsible factory. A nation-wide programme to fortify vegetable oils with vitamins A and D 3 was established in Morocco in 2002. The system devised for monitoring the quality of the fortied product is described in detail in Annex E ,and serves to illustrate the practical application of the principles of regulatory monitoringintroduced here. 8.3 Household monitoring It is generally assumed that having established through regulatory monitoringthat a fortied product is of the required quality at the retail store level, the same product will be of a similar quality once it reaches households and individuals. Because the product may have deteriorated during storage, conr-mation of this assumption is always recommended. Nor can it be assumed thatjust because fortied foods are available to buy from shops, they will necessar-ily be consumed by the target population; consumers may well purchase non-fortied foods in preference to fortied products (if both fortied andnon-fortied foods are available locally). Even if ofcially only fortied prod-ucts are available at retail stores, consumers may be able to acquire non-fortied (probably cheaper) foods via non-ofcial means, such as smuggling and from door-to-door sellers. 8.3.1 Aims and objectives In short, the aim of household monitoring is to assess whether or not a pro- gramme is providing appropriately fortied products in sufcient amounts and ataffordable prices to the targeted population. More specically, household monitoring can answer questions such as: Are the fortied products accessible (i.e. available and affordable) to the tar- geted households and individuals? Are they of expected quality and are theyavailable from retail stores in targeted regions/communities? Are the fortied products being purchased by the targeted households, taking into account tastes and preferences, and patterns of consumption? If not, whyare the fortied products not being purchased? Is it because they are unaf-fordable (cost), because their taste and appearance is altered by the fortica-tion process, or is it because they are not part of the usual consumptionpattern of the targeted population?8. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 191Are the fortied products being purchased and consumed in sufcient amounts by specic household members to meet programme nutritional goals(i.e. to increase their micronutrient intake and/or to meet a predened level of micronutrient requirements)? If not, is it because of cultural practices con-cerning the appropriateness of feeding these products to specic householdmembers (based on age, physiological status, etc.), or is it because of tastesand preferences of specic household members, or because of inequitablefood distribution within the household? Which individuals/population groups are not being reached by the fortica- tion programme and why? Are individual family members consuming sufcient amounts of fortied products to increase their intake of specic micronutrients (and/or to meetprogramme nutritional goals for specic age/physiological groups)? In effect, monitoring at the household level addresses three key aspects of programme performance, that is to say, provision, utilization and coverage(see section 8.1). Household monitoring activities designed to assess each of these aspects of food fortication programme performance are outlined inTable 8.4 ;in each case, suitable indicators and data collection methodologies are proposed. 8.3.2 Methodological considerations AsTable 8.4 indicates, there are a variety of approaches that can be used to gather data for the purposes of assessing programme performance in terms ofprovision, utilization and coverage. Primary data collection as part of the pro-gramme's overall monitoring and evaluation system is one option. Alternatively, and this is often a more practical solution, it may be possible to join with - or\"piggy-back\" on to - other programmes that have ongoing or regular data col-lection components. For example, some countries in Central America carry outschool censuses at regular intervals; it is then a relatively simple matter to collectsamples of fortied products, such as vitamin A-fortied sugar or iodized salt,byasking pupils to bring a small sample from home to school. Other routine data collection systems which might provide opportunities for \"piggy-backing\"include 30-cluster surveys, sentinel sites monitoring, and lot quality assurancesampling (LQAS) monitoring systems ( 6,348-350 ).These types of simple mon- itoring systems are widely used to monitor immunization coverage, universal saltiodization and other primary health care interventions. If such systems are notalready in place, they can be established specically for the fortication pro-gramme. Guidance on how to implement relatively simple data collection systems, and examples of their successful application in health care settings, isavailable elsewhere ( 6,351-353 ).GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 1928.

Many countries already operate routine systems for collecting price data for a number of food commodities, in which case fortied foods can simplybe added to the list of products being monitored.The monitoring of programmeutilization and coverage, however, necessitates data collection at the householdor individual level. Any of the simple data collection systems mentioned abovecan be used to collect information relating to utilization. Conducting represen-tative household and community surveys is another option, but these tend to be more costly. Again, it is possible to take advantage of, or piggy-back on, exist-ing data collection vehicles or surveys that are being conducted at the house-hold level. In addition, qualitative approaches, which include observations, informant interviews and focus group discussions, may be useful for gatheringinformation about programme implementation and service delivery, use of thefortied products and users' perceptions about the fortied versus the non-fortied foods. Coverage of a fortication programme is usually assessed by determining what proportion of at-risk individuals consume the fortied products in suf-cient amounts and with sufcient frequency. Thus, to evaluate coverage, infor-mation on the number of at-risk individuals is necessary. This can be obtainedfrom either a census or by surveying a representative sample of the population.Estimates of the intake of the fortied product(s) and/or of the micronutrient(s)of interest are also required. Two approaches are available for evaluating programme coverage. The rst involves assessing the total dietary intake of the micronutrient of interest, withand without considering the consumption of the fortied food. This allows thepercentage of the population, analysing each of the target groups independently(e.g. preschool-aged children, adolescents, women), that moves from havingintakes that are below the relevant EAR to having intakes that are above the EARto be estimated. The proportion of the population that moves from below toabove the EAR provides a measure of the success of the programme .The second approach is to estimate the additional intake that would be supplied throughconsumption of the fortied food. In this case, the measure of the programme'ssuccess is given by the proportion of the population fullling that additionalintake. Success criteria will inevitably vary according to the specic objectivesof the programme and should be set accordingly. However, it can be helpful toset stricter criteria for measuring coverage of targeted fortication programmes,in terms of the proportion of the population that will benet, to ensure that thosemost in need of fortied foods actually receive them.8. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 1958.4 Impact evaluation The main purpose of evaluating any intervention is to determine whether or not it is reaching its overall goals. In the case of food fortication programmes, theprimary objective is to improve the nutritional status of the target population.Impact evaluations of most health and nutrition programmes, including foodfortication interventions, are however rarely performed, in part because theyare perceived as being complex, costly and sometimes threatening. The resultsof impact evaluations are nevertheless important decision-making tools, provid-ing answers to important questions such as: Has the intake of a specic fortied food increased to expected levels following a food fortication programme? Has the intake of specic nutrients of interest increased to expected levels following a food fortication programme? Has the nutritional status of specic groups (for selected nutrients) improved, as a result of the fortication programme? Has the fortication programme reduced the prevalence of specic micronu- trient deciencies? Has the fortication programme reduced the prevalence of poor functional outcomes, such as growth faltering, morbidity from infectious diseases, childmortality, and poor cognitive and motor development? Has the fortication programme been more effective in improving status of certain micronutrients and/or among certain age/physiological groups thanothers? The following subsections review a range of methodologies that can be used for food fortication programme evaluation, highlighting in each case the purposesand settings for which they are most appropriate. Although not all forticationprogramme evaluations will necessarily require the more sophisticated andtherefore the more costly methodologies, impartiality is always vital. In order toensure that impact evaluations are impartial, it is recommended that they arecarried out under the auspices of independent research groups or internationalagencies. Ideally, funds for monitoring and evaluation, should be allocated at thetime of programme design and budget allocation, but this is not to say that fundscannot be complemented by donor agencies at a later date. 8.4.1 Impact evaluation design There are a number of different ways in which the evaluation of the impact of a food fortication programme can be tackled. However, the choice ofGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 196methodology should be dictated by the specic purpose of the evaluation, and bythe availability of resources.The level of precision required to satisfy the needs of decision-makers regarding the effectiveness of their programme is anotherimportant factor to bear in mind when selecting an evaluation design. Habicht et al. ( 344) have devised a useful way of classifying the various approaches to evaluating public health interventions. The classication is basedon the premise that the choice of the evaluation method depends on the preci-sion of data required by decision-makers to be able to say that the programmebeing evaluated has been effective. Three levels of inference are identied:adequacy ,plausibility andprobability .Application of this classication to forti- cation programme evaluation is presented in Table 8.5 . 8.4.1.1 Adequacy evaluation Anadequacy evaluation is the appropriate choice if the objective is to assess whether the prevalence of a particular micronutrient deciency is at or below apre-determined level. For example, the goal of a fortication programme maybe to reduce the prevalence of iron deciency among children to 10% or less(or any other cut-off point used to dene a public health problem). In this case,adequacy would be achieved if the evaluation showed that the prevalence of irondeciency at the time of the evaluation was lower than the 10% pre-establishedcut-off point. Similarly, if a programme sought to raise the level of intake of for-tied wheat flour by a target population group to a certain pre-determined level,an adequacy evaluation would simply have to demonstrate that this level (or ahigher level) of intake has been reached by the targeted population. Adequacy evaluations are the simplest (and least costly) type of evaluation to carry out, primarily because they do not require randomization or the use of acontrol group ( Table 8.5 ). Nevertheless, adequacy evaluations demand the same level of scientic rigour as any other type of evaluation. Appropriate studydesigns for this type of evaluation include one-time cross-sectional surveys thatfocus on the outcome of interest. 8.4.1.2 Plausibility evaluation Aplausibility evaluation seeks to demonstrate, with a given level of certainty, that the reduction in say, the prevalence of iron deciency, is related to the fortica-tion programme being evaluated. Many factors unrelated to food forticationcan reduce the prevalence of iron deciency, and thus the reduction can bewrongly attributed to the fortication programme unless the evaluation takesthese factors into consideration. For example, if public health measures tocontrol parasites and infections have been implemented, or if development pro-grammes to raise incomes have resulted in an increased intake of animal prod- ucts in the targeted population, a failure to control for these external effects could8.

Plausibility To be able to state that it is plausible Plausibility evaluations require a quasi-experimental design such as: that food fortication was the \u2014 a cross-sectional study which compares households (or individuals) that consumed cause of changes in nutritional fortied foods with a comparable group that did not;status. \u2014 a longitudinal study in which measures are recorded in the same individuals before and after a period of fortication; \u2014 a longitudinal study in which measures are recorded before and after a period of fortication in a group that received fortied foods, and also in a control group that did not; this allows changes due to other factors (e.g. food prices, national economy) to beaccounted for; \u2014 a case-control study which compares cases who consumed fortied foods with controls who did not but who are similar in many relevant characteristics, such as socioeconomic status, place of residence (i.e. geographic location, urban vs. rural, household composition), gender, age (i.e. matched controls). Probability To determine, with a level of Probability evaluations require a double-blind, randomized, experimental design that co mpares probability that was established responses to fortied foods with non-fortied foods. This requires:before the evaluation, that \u2014 randomization of participants in the \"fortied\" and \"non-fortied\" groups;observed changes in nutritional \u2014 before-and-after measurements in the same subjects;status are due to fortication. \u2014 that neither the participants nor the evaluators know which treatments are being consumed by whom, during the intervention or during the data analysis (i.e. a double-blind study).wrongly attribute the reduction in iron deciency to food fortication. It is there- fore important for plausibility evaluations to control for these potential con-founding factors and biases through the careful selection of an appropriate study design and through the use of multivariate data analysis techniques. Plausibilityevaluations use quasi-experimental or case-control designs ( Table 8.5 ): they re- quire either the comparison between an intervention and a control group (whodid not receive the intervention), or before-and-after information on a groupwho received the intervention (a pre-post design), or both (i.e. before-and-afterinformation on both an intervention and a control group). 8.4.1.3 Probability evaluation Probability evaluations provide the highest level of condence that the food for-tication programme is responsible for the observed reduction in the prevalenceof deciency. Only probability methods can establish causality; these necessitatethe use of randomized, controlled experiments, carried out in a double-blindmanner whenever possible ( Table 8.5 ). The probability evaluation is based on the premise that there is only a small known probability (usually P<0.05, i.e. a less than 5% chance) that the observed differences in iron deciency (forexample) between the group that was randomly assigned to receive fortiedfoods and the non-fortied food control group are due to chance. Probability evaluations are complex and expensive to perform because they need a randomized sample and a control group. They may not be feasible inusual eld conditions, either for practical reasons or for ethical reasons. Forexample, if the fortied product is different in appearance and/or taste, it willbe impossible to carry out the intervention in a double-blind manner. Similarly,it may not be practical to randomize the population into a food-fortied and acontrol group. Moreover, using a control group often raises ethical concerns.For these reasons, probability methods are more commonly used for small, pilot efcacy trials (i.e. interventions carried out under controlled conditions to deter-mine efcacy), than for effectiveness trials (large-scale interventions carried outunder real-life eld conditions, and facing usual implementation constraints).Probability evaluations are the reference standard of efcacy research. Note that the questions listed above (page 14) assume either a plausibility or a probability evaluation design, rather than an adequacy design. This is becausethe formulation of these questions implies a change or an improvement that is attributable to the fortication programme. Adequacy evaluation designs can address similar questions, but they would have to be phrased with reference topre-established criteria of adequacy, rather than with respect to a change attrib-utable to the programme. For example, the rst question: Has the intake of a specic fortied food increased to expected levels fol- lowing a food fortication programme?8. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 199would become: Is the intake of a specic fortied food at the expected level (say, is 90% of the population consuming salt fortied at the mimimum household level)? Adequacy criteria could also be expressed in terms of biochemical indicators; for instance: Is the prevalence of vitamin A deciency among preschool-aged children lower than say 20% (or any other pre-established criteria) following the foodfortication programme? 8.4.2 Methodological considerations 8.4.2.1 Selection of outcome indicators Outcome indicators that can be used to assess the impact of fortication pro- grammes include measures of intake (which can also be used as indicators of utilization - see section 8.3; T able 8.4); clinical and biochemical indicators ofnutritional status (see Tables 3.1, 3.4, 3.6, 4.1, 4.3-4.5, 4.7, 4.8, 4.10, 4.11, 4.13-4.16 ); and functional indicators such as growth, morbidity, mortality or development. Examples of each type of outcome indicator are given in Table 8.6,along with suitable methods for their measurement. Given that the goal of food fortication is to improve the nutritional status of a population, biochemical markers would normally be the indicators of choicefor evaluating the impact of fortication programmes. However, the measure-ment of biochemical status indicators requires considerable resources and tech-nical expertise, for example, for collecting blood samples in the eld and forconducting high-quality laboratory analyses, which means that this is not alwaysa practical, or indeed a feasible, option. Fortunately, there are cheaper and lesscomplex alternatives to measuring biochemical status indicators for assessing the impact of a programme, such as measuring the consumption of a fortiedproduct or the intake of a particular micronutrient of interest. These measures are suitable alternatives to biochemical indicators in cases where strong evidence of their validity has been obtained from either rigorous efcacy trials 1or from effectiveness trials conducted in similar conditions as the programme being eval-uated. For example, if it has been established in efcacy trials that consumptionof a certain minimum amount of a given fortied product results in a desirablechange in one or more biochemical indicators (and prevents micronutrient de-ciency), other fortication programmes using the same food vehicle can rely onGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 2001An efcacy trial is one that applies an intervention under controlled conditions to determine the magnitude of effect that can be achieved under the best possible circumstances ( 344). Effective- ness trials, on the other hand, test the impact of an intervention under real life conditions, andgiven usual operational inefciencies that occur under normal eld conditions.consumption data to measure their impact. This technique is commonly em- ployed in evaluations of salt iodization and immunization programmes. In thecase of the former, coverage information is used to measure success, an approachthat is valid because there is strong evidence that iodized salt, consumed regu-larly and in sufcient amounts, is effective in preventing iodine deciency. Theselection of outcome indicators is discussed further in section 8.5 in the contextof the minimum requirements for monitoring and evaluation systems for forti-cation interventions. 8.4.2.2 Data requirements In order to be able to conduct an impact evaluation using any of the indicatorsand methodologies listed in Table 8.6 ,it is necessary to rst calculate the8.

Responsible: Independent researchers. aMonitoring of the intake of fortied products can also be done as part of household moni- toring (see Table 8.4 ). bAn impact evaluation should only be performed once programme monitoring has indicated that programme is operating in a satisfactory manner and therefore, is in theory capable ofachieving its nutritional goals. Full impact evaluation need only be done once, as long asregular monitoring ensures appropriate fortication levels at all stages (i.e. in factories, retail stores and households), adequate utilization of the product and adequate coverage of thetargeted population.number of subjects that will need to be surveyed (i.e. the sample size) so as to ensure a result of adequate precision and sensitivity (i.e. be able to detect dif-ferences of a particular size when they exist). Ideally, a random procedure should be used to select subjects for study. Specic data needs for each category of impact evaluation are as follows: Adequacy evaluations require data on the chosen outcomes, and also a minimum amount of information about the study subjects (such as age, sexand physiological status) to facilitate interpretation of the results. Plausibility evaluations demand more detailed information about the study subjects in order to account for confounding factors. However, the moreinformation that is collected on possibly confounding or other explanatoryfactors, the more rigorous the evaluation design will need to be if it is todemonstrate that the outcome achieved is related to the intervention. It istherefore prudent to collect information on factors unrelated to the fortica-tion programme, but which may have contributed to the changes observed inthe outcome of interest. Data from other programmes implemented in thearea, on say community improvements, and on household and individualsociodemographic characteristics can all help strengthen the analysis andinterpret the ndings. This type of information can also be used to under-stand pathways and mechanisms, and to help interpret lack of impact. F o r probability evaluations ,if a double-blind experimental study design is used, control for confounding influences is not required. However, it is alwaysuseful to have information on intermediary outcomes to help describe mech-anisms and dose-response relationships, and to identify subgroups of thepopulation that may have beneted more (or less) than others from the intervention. 8.4.2.3 Timing of an impact evaluation As noted at the start of this chapter, an evaluation of the impact of a fortica-tion programme should not be undertaken until a certain level of operationalperformance has been achieved. Say, for example, commercial monitoring estab-lishes that levels of a micronutrient in a product available from retail stores areonly 20% of what they should be, conducting an impact evaluation of such apoorly functioning programme would only be a waste of time, effort and money.It is therefore important that fortication programmes establish a priori theminimum criteria for the quality of service delivery that it must achieve beforeany efforts to evaluate its impact are undertaken. The timing of programme evaluation is will also depend on how quickly an impact on the biochemical indicators of interest can be expected. In other words,how soon after a programme has been implemented and has been found to beGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 202operating satisfactorily should an impact evaluation be undertaken? Both the type of intervention (fortication versus supplementation, for example) and thenutrient(s) of interest are key factors to consider. In relation to the former, the amount of nutrient(s) delivered daily in fortied foods is usually much lessthan that which can be administered in a supplement; moreover, the fortiedfoods may not be consumed every day, or in the expected amounts. The com-bined effect of these factors is that it will take longer for the biological impactof a micronutrient fortication programme to become detectable than it will fora supplementation programme, probably by as much as several months (espe- cially in the case of effectiveness trials). For instance, it takes about 6-9 monthsbefore the effect of iron fortication on iron status is seen. The rate of change in nutritional status indicators varies substantially by nutri- ent, and also according to the sensitivity of the indicator. It takes about 1-2 yearsfrom the start of a salt iodization programme to see a signicant reduction ingoitre. Some individuals may take even longer than this to recover, especially ifthey are also iron decient ( 86). On the other hand, urinary iodine is a fairly responsive indicator of iodine intake, and should increase signicantly within afew weeks of the commencement of an increased iodine consumption. On thewhole, changes in biochemical indicators of vitamin status tend to be more rapidthan those in indicators of mineral status. For instance, population serum folateand plasma homocysteine concentrations respond within 6 months of the intro-duction into the diet of flour fortied with folic acid ( 49,52 ). Similarly, con- sumption of sugar fortied with vitamin A produces measurable impacts afteronly 6 months ( 46). 8.4.2.4 Counfounding factors Finally, when planning an impact evaluation it is important to recognize that a number of factors can affect the ability of individuals to respond to fortication.Particularly signicant in this regard is the prevalence of parasitic infestations and infections in a population. Some parasites cause large, continuing micronu-trient losses; hookworm, for example, causes intestinal loss of blood and there-fore increased losses of iron, vitamin A, vitamin B 12and several other nutrients. Parasite control programmes are obviously an effective strategy in these situa- tions and should be instigated in conjunction with food fortication. The presence of parasites and infections can also affect the sensitivity of indi- cators of nutritional status, which can make the impact of a fortication pro-gramme more difcult to detect. For example, haemoglobin and serum ferritin are responsive to changes in iron status but are also affected by inflammationand infectious disorders. If these conditions are widespread, iron status can only really be assessed using a combination of indicators, that is serum ferritin in combination with serum transferrin receptors or erythrocyte zinc 8. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 203protoporphyrine, and an indicator of inflammation, such as C-reative protein (75) (see also Table 3.1 ). This approach has been adopted with good effect in both Viet Nam ( 28) and in Morocco ( 44) to demonstrate the efcacy of iron fortication of sh sauce and salt, respectively. The presence of malaria pres-ents particular challenges: malaria not only leads to a substantial reduction inhaemoglobin concentrations, but also affects many other nutritional status Simultaneous assessment of malaria parasites (by blood smears) or more accurately, of malaria antigens usingtest strips ( 152), and of indicators of inflammation (such as alpha-1 glycopro- tein, and C-reactive protein), will assist in the detection of individuals whose testresults may be affected by malaria. 8.5 What is the minimum every fortication programme should have in terms of a monitoring and evaluation system? This chapter has highlighted the importance for food fortication programmes of having a well-planned monitoring and evaluation system. These systemsshould be designed in such a way that the information provided by monitoringand evaluation is used effectively for decision-making and for overall programmemanagement. In order for this to happen, responsibilities for data collection atthe different levels must be clearly established and the system must include feed-back loops, which allow the information to flow (in a timely manner) to the enti-ties responsible for taking action at the different levels. Regulatory monitoring is an essential part of any monitoring and evaluation system and should always be implemented, at least to some degree. Informationfrom internal, external and commercial monitoring activities should be sharedregularly with all sectors engaged in the food fortication programme. Feedbackactivities should include the sharing of information about successes and anyfollow up on corrective measures required when problems were detected. Of equal importance is household monitoring. Its value lies in its ability to provide a general appraisal of the impact of the programme, and in the absenceof an effective system of nutritional surveillance, it also provides informationabout the importance of food fortication in the diet of target populations. Theannual cost of household monitoring has been estimated at less than US$ 10 000 per fortied food (O. Dary, personal communication, 2004). Despite its relatively low cost, household monitoring is often neglected in many programmes. In many settings, household monitoring is dependent on external donors for nancial support, a factor which limits its permanence and sustainability. The chapter has also stressed the urgent need to measure the impact of food fortication programmes, again to support decision-making, and, in particular,GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 204to assist programme planners and policy-makers in making decisions about pro- gramme continuation, modication, expansion or termination. Different types of impact evaluations can be employed; these vary in their level of sophistica-tion and in the intensity of resources required. Decisions about which specictype of evaluation and which outcome indicators to use should be driven pri-marily by programme objectives and the level of precision required to be ableto attribute impact to the programme itself (i.e. this will determine whether anadequacy or a more complex plausibility design is needed, for example). The choice of outcome indicator(s) for impact evaluations is a pivotal one. Questions that can help guide the selection of an appropriate of outcome indicator are: Can intake measures be used instead of more invasive (and often more costly) biochemical indicators? Howoften do impact evaluations have to be carried out? The answer to these questions largely depends on the availability and strength of evidence from efcacy trials and previous effectiveness evaluations of com-parable programmes conducted in similar environments and population groups.The results of only one or just a few efcacy trials are usually sufcient to provethat a fortied food can change the nutritional status (and its associated bio-logical indicators) in a human population, in which case it might not be neces-sary to repeat such experiments in each community (see also section 8.4.2.1).It thus follows that the rst step in planning an impact evaluation is usually todetermine whether or not there is strong evidence from existing efcacy trialsthat the planned intervention causes a given impact when conducted under controlled conditions. If strong evidence from efcacy trials can be established, effectiveness trials can then be implemented to test whether the same impact can also be achievedwhen the intervention is delivered under normal eld conditions and programmeconstraints. In the case of fortication programmes, if other effectiveness trialsindicate that an impact can be obtained over a given period of time with anintake of a specic amount of micronutrients through the consumption of for-tied products, there is no need to invest in the more resource intensive andcomplex demonstrations of impact on biochemical indicators. It may be suf-cient to ensure that the targeted population consumes the fortied food ofexpected quality in sufcient amounts and with adequate frequency. However,before conclusions obtained from one community can be extrapolated toanother, it is important to assure that the conditions are similar. It may be nec-essary to conduct efcacy trials to corroborate ndings once every 5-10 years,especially if environmental, dietary and health conditions of the targeted popu-lation change rapidly. This objective might be combined with the function of8. MONITORING AND EVALUATION 205general nutrition surveys to monitor the evolution of the nutritional status of the population. Obviously, in the absence of strong evidence from efcacy trials, there are no short-cuts and a detailed impact evaluation (efcacy trial or probability evalua-tion), involving appropriate biochemical indicators, will need to be carried out.The comments made previously about the timing of evaluations (section8.4.2.3) and the need to consider potential confounding factors (section 8.4.2.4)become especially pertinent in these circumstances. Summary A well-designed, well-managed monitoring and evaluation system is essential for ensuring the success and sustainability of any food fortication programme. As inte- gral components of the programme, monitoring and evaluations activities should be formulated and budgeted for during the very early planning stages. Some degree of regulatory monitoring is critical. Of the three main categories of regulatory monitoring - internal monitoring (conducted at factories and packers), external monitoring (conducted at factories and packers) and commercial monitor- ing (conducted at retail stores) - internal monitoring is a must. In settings where effective enforcement mechanisms exist, it is usually sufcient to conrm compli- ance with regulations in samples taken from retail stores (commercial monitoring).Elsewhere it is prudent to conduct external monitoring at both the factory level and at retail stores. Impact evaluations should only be carried once it has been established, through regulatory and household monitoring, that the programme has achieved a pre-determined level of operational efciency. Although rigorous impact evaluations of food fortication programmes are urgently needed, not all programmes will require the most costly and sophisticated designs. Judicious choices will have to be made in selecting the most appropriate evalua- tion for each particular situation.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 206CHAPTER 9 Estimating the cost-effectiveness and cost-benet of fortication Notwithstanding the limitations mentioned in section 1.4, food fortication may often be the least expensive way of achieving a particular nutritional goal, suchas a specied reduction in the prevalence of anaemia, iodine deciency or sub-clinical vitamin A deciency. Put another way, fortication is frequently morecost-effective than other public health interventions that have the potential to achieve the same health or nutritional outcome, such as supplementation.Indeed, several studies have demonstrated that fortication is not only cost- effective (i.e. is a cheaper way to increase micronutrient intake compared with other interventions that have the same aim), but also has a high cost-benet ratio (i.e. is a good investment). In this chapter the concepts of cost-effectiveness and cost-benet are for- mally dened. T echniques for estimating the cost-effectiveness of an interven-tion and for performing a cost-benet analysis are also outlined, and illustratedin the latter half of the chapter by a series of example calculations for a hypo-thetical low-income country. The methods employed can be readily modiedand applied to other countries. Although both cost-effectiveness and cost-benet analyses are widely used as decision-making tools by policy-makersworking in the public health arena, their application to food fortication is a rel- atively new development. T o date, only interventions involving iron, iodine and vitamin A have been evaluated in these terms, and consequently form the focusof the material presented here. 9.1 Basic concepts and denitions 9.1.1 Cost-effectiveness Cost-effectiveness is dened as the cost of achieving a specied outcome. In the case of food fortication, examples of the desired outcome might include: avert-ing one case of subclinical vitamin A deciency, averting one case of anaemia,or averting one case of goitre or of iodine deciency. Two outcome measures that are frequently employed in cost-effectiveness assessments of health interventions are the \"cost per death averted\" and the \"costper disability-adjusted life-year saved\" (or cost per DALY saved). The former,the cost per death averted, has been successfully used to assess the cost- 207effectiveness of various fortication and supplementation interventions, but in this context its application requires making various critical assumptions (seesection 9.2.1). For example, costs per death averted have been estimated for vitamin A supplementation for children and for iron supplementation for preg-nant women (groups that are particularly susceptible to deciencies and there-fore frequently targeted in intervention programmes). However, it is a less useful calculation in the case of iodine fortication, principally because mortality outcomes are relatively rare, the main benet being increased productivity (seesection 9.3.2). The advantage of the other widely used effectiveness measure, the cost per DALYsaved, lies in the fact that it combines mortality and morbidity outcomes into a single indicator ( 354,355 ).This measure has been employed to good effect to assess the effectiveness of various health interventions, including forticationand supplementation, as part of WHO's CHOICE project (see Box 9.1 ). However, relative to the alternative measure, the cost per death averted, its cal-culation is more demanding in terms of data requirements and the assumptionsthat must be made (see section 9.2.1) Cost-effectiveness analysis is a particularly useful exercise for comparing dif- ferent interventions that share the same outcome, for example, for comparingsupplementation with vitamin A with fortication with vitamin A, or for com-paring vitamin A supplementation with immunization. In both cases the sharedoutcome is the number of deaths averted.The two pieces of information requiredfor the calculation of the cost-effectiveness of an intervention are: the unit costof the intervention (i.e. the cost per person assisted per year), and some measureof the effect of the intervention (i.e. the proportion of the target population thatachieves some specied outcome). The cost estimates, being less resource inten-sive, tend to be easier to obtain than the estimates of the effect, which require(at a minimum) a baseline and a follow-up assessment, and (ideally) a controlgroup.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 208BOX9.1 Choosinginterventionsthatarecost-effective: WHO'sCHOICEProject CHOICE stands for \"CHOosing Interventions that are Cost-Effective\", and is a tool developed by WHO to help decision-makers select those interventions andprogrammes that provide the maximize benets for the available resources. Bygeneralizing the cost-effectiveness analysis, the application of the CHOICEmodel indicates which interventions provide the best value for money. Application of the CHOICE model to data from WHO's Africa D region (mainly West Africa) has demonstrated that micronutrient interventions arepotentially highly cost-effective1. In Figure 9.1 the average cost per DALY saved by hypothetical programmes for zinc supplementation in the under-ves (coverage, 80% of the target population), iron supplementation in pregnantwomen (coverage, 50% of pregnant women), vitamin A/zinc fortication (coverage, 80% of the general population), and iron fortication (coverage, 80% of the general population) are compared. Both the fortication programmes achieve relatively low costs per DALY saved. The same iron and vitamin A/zincfortication programmes are compared in Figure 9.2 , but this time with the following interventions: oral rehydration (coverage, 80% of the target popula-tion), case management of pneumonia (coverage, 80% of the target popula-tion), and disinfection of water supply at point of use combined with water use education (coverage, 100% target population). Whereas all of these programmes were found to be highly cost-effective, the fortication pro- grammes were particularly so.9.

In itssimplest form, a cost-benet analysis compares the monetary cost of an inter-vention with the monetary value of the outcome (i.e. the benet). The outcomes or benets may be increased productivity (e.g. iron fortication makes adultsless anaemic and hence more productive) or possibly lower health care systemcosts (e.g. mothers who are less anaemic will incur fewer complications duringchildbirth). Since cost-benet analyses can be used to compare the relativemerits of health interventions with other kinds of government spending, they areespecially helpful for advocating for increased resources for nutrition and health. A cost-benet ratio calculation requires much the same unit cost and effect data as a cost-effectiveness analysis. Again, the cost data are typically easier andcheaper to obtain than the effect data. In addition, the benet or rather theoutcome of a health intervention (e.g. a reduction in prevalence of goitre or achange in the mean urinary iodine excretion of a population) has to be expressedin nancial terms, that is to say, assigned a monetary value. Most cost-benetstudies do not do this directly, but rely on the ndings of other studies that havelinked the proximate health outcome to a nancial benet. For example,cost-benet analyses involving iodine interventions, which are seeking to esti-mate the nancial gain of eliminating one case of goitre (as an intermediateoutcome), turn to studies that have estimated the costs associated with the lossof productivity per child born to a mother with goitre.The worked example pre-sented in section 9.3.2 adopts this approach. 9.2 Information needs 9.2.1 Estimating unit costs Unit cost calculations (i.e. the calculation of the cost of the intervention per person per year) need to take into account not just the recurrent costs of sup-plying forticants or supplements, but also a number of other associated costs.For fortication, these typically include: \u2014the initial investment in the technology required for adding the forticant to the food vehicle (which will vary depending on the number of pro-cessing facilities and the existing level of technology, the micronutrient andthe nature of the packaging, storage and/or handling of the nal productthat is required); \u2014the cost of \"social marketing\" to attain acceptance of (or prefer- ence for) the fortied food;GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 210\u2014the cost of quality control and quality assurance by producers and of gov- ernment monitoring and evaluation activities. In the case of supplementation, the additional costs may include the time and logistics costs of the distribution of the supplement (which are not alwaysreported), and again, the costs associated with monitoring and evaluation.Typical costs incurred by a wheat flour fortication programme (with iron and zinc) are set out in Table 9.1 ;these include the initial investment costs (amor- tized over expected lifetime of the equipment), recurrent costs, and the cost ofmonitoring and evaluation. The estimated unit costs of various past supplementation and fortication programmes, compiled by Levin et al. ( 357), are listed in Table 9.2 .According to these data, unit costs for supplementation are consistently higher than those for fortication. Supplementation costs are 10-30 times higher than fortica-tion costs in the case of iodine, 3-30 times higher for iron, and 1.5-3 timeshigher for vitamin A. The cost differential is largely dependent on what pro-portion the target population is of the whole population; fortication becomesincreasingly cost-effective the higher the proportion of the population in needof the intervention. Although now rather out of date, the unit cost data reported by Levin et al. (357) do provide some useful insight into the relative cost-effectiveness of sup- plementation and fortication as strategies for correcting micronutrient de-ciencies. For instance, in the case of vitamin A, if supplementation costs 2-2.5times as much as fortication per person, supplementation is potentially themore attractive option when the target group comprises less than 40-50% of thepopulation (e.g. children aged less than 2 years). However, for iron the situa-tion is reversed: per person iron supplementation is at least 10 times more costlythan fortication but the prevalence of anaemia is well over 10% in most devel-oping country populations. In this case then, mass fortication would most likelybe the more cost-effective strategy. It should be stressed that these conclusionsare based on average data and cannot be applied to all settings; the relative cost-effectiveness of supplementation and fortication will vary markedly acrosscountries according to both the unit cost of the intervention and the fraction ofpopulation targeted. Another factor to consider in the supplementation versus fortication debate is the effectiveness of the intervention itself; this can be highly variable. In thecase of vitamin A deciencies, both supplementation and fortication have beenshown to be effective in impact evaluations ( 33,46 ). In areas of endemic iodine deciency, salt iodization programmes have also been shown to be highly effec-tive ( 25,359 ). However, the evidence for the effectiveness of iron interven- tions is less clear cut (see section 1.3.1.1). Recently completed studies fromChina and Viet Nam, involving soy and sh sauces, respectively, suggest that9.

On the other hand, despite the fact that iron sup- plementation has proved to be efcacious in controlled trials ( 360), many iron supplementation programmes have been relatively ineffective in improving anaemia status, even in targeted subgroups. One possible explanation for this isapparent discrepancy is that in many cases iron deciency is not the main causeof the observed anaemia, but rather it is some other factor. 9.2.2 Cost-effectiveness analyses Most cost-effectiveness analyses rely on a single indicator or outcome measure to reflect the change brought about by the intervention, usually a measure ofnutritional status. However, in terms of the magnitude of the calculated cost-effectiveness, different outcome measures do not always yield the same result.Possible outcome indicators for iron, for example, include the change in mean haemoglobin level, the change in mean haemoglobin level of the initially 9.

Sources: references ( 357,358 ).decient population, and the proportion of the population removed from anaemia. The rst measure gives equal weight to improvements in haemoglobinstatus irrespective of the initial level of deciency, the second gives equal weight to all those initially decient (again, irrespective whether the deciency wassevere or mild), and the third will give a higher weight to improvements in themildly decient, but will ignore improvements that don't \"bump\" people overthe threshold, even if their haemoglobin status improves. (As explained inChapter 3, anaemia is an imperfect indicator of iron status due to the fact thatin many populations anaemia has multiple causes). The most useful outcome or effect measures for cost-effectiveness analyses tend to be those which also provide information on the causes of the change innutritional status. This is particularly helpful when making comparisons withother studies, which may have employed a different outcome measure. Ifrestricted to using only a single outcome measure, then it is desirable to selectthe one that can be linked to other outcomes of interest. In the iron exampleabove, the proportion of the population removed from anaemia is the mostuseful effect indicator, because it is possible to link anaemia status (i.e.anaemic/not anaemic) to productivity outcomes or to pregnancy complicationoutcomes. The cost-effectiveness of fortication interventions is likely to vary consider- ably according to the prevailing conditions, since it is heavily dependent on thefollowing factors: the food vehicle used, the storage conditions and the stability of the forti- cant during storage; the initial level of deciency in the population (e.g. improvements in iron status may be easier to obtain in initially more decient populations, becausetheir iron absorption is more efcient and because the cost per case ofanaemia averted is lower if more of the population is anaemic); dietary patterns, especially with respect to the consumption of foods which inhibit or enhance absorption of the micronutrient of interest in the samemeal; marketing and processing patterns, and whether the chosen vehicle is con- sumed by all households in the groups likely to be decient, including thepoor and those living in remote areas. Despite the inherent variability in the cost-effectiveness of food fortication interventions, it is not necessary to perform analyses for all programmes and forall conditions. Nevertheless, information should be obtained for a selection ofprogrammes operating under a range of conditions.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 2149.2.3 Cost-benet analysis Undertaking a cost-benet analysis of a fortication programme is generally more involved and certainly more demanding of data (and assumptions) thanis a cost-effectiveness analysis. However, only cost-benet analyses permit com-parisons across a broad range of benets, including non-health outcomes. Issuesto bear in mind when undertaking cost-benet analysis include the following: What benets should be included? Some benets (e.g. lower health care costs because of improved iron status, and thus reduced numbers of maternaldeaths) may be important, but hard to calculate in the developing countrycontext. Omitting important benets will make the results more conservative. Should non-market benets be taken into account? The effects of food forti- cation, for example, improved productivity in women, will only partiallyshow up as market benets. Fortication may well result in important non-market benets, such as better child-care, which will affect the market pro-ductivity of the next generation. Ideally then, non-market benets should bevalued, by using shadow prices or contingent valuation methods. Howcan future benets be incorporated? Ideally, the present value of the future benets stream should be included, appropriately discounted, say by3% (the social rate of discount typically employed in cost-benet-type analy-ses). Nevertheless, even this low rate of discount still favours interventionswith immediate benets (e.g. those targeted at adults) relative to those withfuture benets (e.g. those targeted at children). Cost-benet analysis (unless equity weights are used) tends to favour inter- ventions that benet the rich more than the poor (the rich have higher wages, and consequently higher productivity losses when they die or fall ill), and sim-ilarly those beneting men rather than women (as men are the more eco-nomically productive, at least in terms of market benets). Because of the assumptions required, it is sometimes desirable to present the results of a cost-benet analysis in natural units (e.g. in terms of productiv-ity (for iron-deciency anaemia) or morbidity rates (for vitamin A deciency)as well as in monetary values. It is possible to undertake cost-benet analyses prospectively (i.e. incidence studies), but this necessitates making assumptions about how a new forticationprogramme will affect the future time path of outcomes, discounting all costsand benets to the present ( 361). The alternative is a prevalence study, in which costs of fortication are compared with the existing costs attributable to de-ciency. The latter requires fewer assumptions, is simpler to undertake, and maybe quite useful for advocacy purposes (see Chapter 10). In the series of worked9. ESTIMATING THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-BENEFIT OF FORTIFICATION 215examples presented in these Guidelines, a prevalence method has been used to estimate the cost-benet ratio of interventions to correct deciencies of iodineand iron (see sections 9.3.2 and 9.3.3). 9.3 Estimating the cost-effectiveness and cost-benet of vitamin A, iodine and iron interventions: worked examples For the purposes of illustrating of application of cost-effectiveness and cost-benet analysis methodologies to food fortication, example calculationsare set out below for three micronutrients, namely, vitamin A, iodine and iron.Country-specic data required to perform these calculations is given in Table 9.3for a hypothetical large, low-income developing country P .These data would be needed to replicate the cost-benet and cost-effectiveness calculations foranother country. Use of generally accepted fortication costs (i.e. those set outin T able 9.3 and which are derived from historical programme data) is recom-mended, unless country-specic data are available. The sample calculations require several key assumptions to be made con- cerning the economic consequences of deciency ( Table 9.4 ). Assumptions must also be made about the effectiveness of a given fortication programme.Although it is clear that effectiveness of fortication depends on the chosen foodGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 216TABLE 9.3 Country-specic data required for cost-effectiveness and cost-benet calculations, country P Annual per capita GDP US$ 430 Child death rate 117.4 per 1 000Proportion of children 5 years in population 25.6% Share of labour force in agriculture 25%Prevalence of subclinical vitamin A deciency, children 5 years 30% Cost per person per year of vitamin A fortication US$ 0.10Prevalence of goitre, women of childbearing age 15%Cost per person per year of iodine fortication US$ 0.10Prevalence of anaemia (population average) 37.25%Cost per person per year of iron fortication US$ 0.12Infant mortality rate 80 per 1 000Maternal mortality rate 200 per 100 000Cost per pregnancy of iron supplementation US$ 1.70 For the purposes of illustrating of application of cost-effectiveness and cost-benet analysis methodologies to food fortication, example calculations are set out below for three micronutri-ents, namely, vitamin A, iodine and iron. Country-specic data required to perform these cal-culations is given in Table9.3for a hypothetical large, low-income developing country P. These data would be needed to replicate the cost-benet and cost-effectiveness calculations foranother country. Use of generally accepted fortication costs (i.e. those set out in Table 9.3 andwhich are derived from historical programme data) is recommended, unless country-specicdata are available.vehicle, the composition of the usual diet, and the pre-existing level of deciency in the population, it is rarely possible to accurately account for such variations,due to a lack of eld data. Under such circumstances, it is instructive to conducta sensitivity analysis, according to the key assumptions made. This involvesrepeating the calculations several times, varying each of the key parameters in turn. If the cost-effectiveness ratio does not change dramatically, or thecost-benet ratio remains robust (i.e. benets remain large relative to costs), asthe parameters are changed, then greater condence can be placed in the conclusions. 9.3.1 Vitamin A supplementation: a cost-effectiveness calculation Cost-benet calculations cannot readily be undertaken for interventions involv- ing vitamin A. Although there are subsequent productivity effects, the moreimmediate benet of vitamin A supplementation in children is a reduction in child morbidity and mortality. For this reason, it is rather more helpful to estimate the cost-effectiveness of vitamin A fortication or supplementation(expressed as the cost per death averted or the cost per DALY saved), whichcan then be compared with other public health interventions that have the poten-tial to achieve the same outcome. The calculation of the cost-effectiveness of vitamin A fortication, using the cost per death averted as the outcome measure, hinges on the assumption that9. ESTIMATING THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-BENEFIT OF FORTIFICATION 217TABLE 9.4 Key assumptions in estimating cost-effectiveness and cost-benet of selected micronutrient fortication Miconutrient Assumptions Reference(s) Vitamin A The relative risk of mortality for children with subclinical ( 362) vitamin A deciency (compared with those that arenon-decient) is on average 1.75 : 1. Iodine Of all births to women with goitre, 3.4% are cretins ( 103,104,355,363 ) (productivity are severely mentally impaired (productivity loss 25%), and the rest suffer minor IQ loss (productivity loss 5%). Iron Productivity loss associated with anaemia is 5% ( 361) (light manual work), 17% (heavy manual work) and 4% in all other kinds of work. The odds ratio associated with 10 g/l increase in ( 364) haemoglobin is 0.80 for maternal mortality, and0.72 for perinatal mortality in Africa (0.84 in other regions); prenatal supplementation with iron is associated with 11.7 g/l improvement in haemoglobin.all child deaths due to vitamin A deciency (VAD) can be averted by vitamin A fortication. If this assumption is made, the calculation is simply a matter ofestimating the proportion of all child deaths that are due to VAD, this being equivalent to the number of deaths that can be averted by fortication. The population attributable risk due to vitamin A deciency (PAR VA D)1is calculated from the prevalence of VAD in children and probability or risk ofdying from VAD, according to the following formula: PAR VA VA VA D1)] where: Pre VA D=the prevalence of vitamin A among children in the under-6 years age group; and RR VA D=the relative risk2of mortality for children with subclinical VAD. Then, based on the values given in Tables 9.3 and9.4,in country P , PAR VA D=(0.3 \u00d70.75)/(1 +0.3\u00d70.75) =0.183. In country P , the child death rate (i.e. in the under-ves) is 117.4 per 1000. Hence the number of child deaths per year that theoretically could be preventedbyeliminating VAD in this population group is: 0.183 \u00d7117.4 =21.48 per 1000. Suppose that the unit cost of vitamin A fortication per year is US$ 0.10. This represents the cost of providing 100% of the daily requirements of vitamin Afor the population in wheat flour, or 75% of the daily requirements of preschool-aged children via margarine (O. Dary, personal communication, 2004). If, incountry P , children under 5 years of age account for 25.6% of the population(T able 9.3), then the cost of fortication per child aged under 5 years is: 0.10/0.256 =0.39, or US$ 0.39 per year. The cost per death averted is therefore:GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 2181The population attributable risk (PAR) is dened as the proportion of cases in the total popula- tion that are attributable to the risk factor. 2The relative risk (RR) is dened as the ratio of the probability of disease development amongexposed individuals to the probability of disease development in non-exposed individuals.0.39/0.02148 =18.16, or US$ 18.16 per year. This cost can then be compared with that of alternative interventions which save children's lives, such as immunization and treatment of infectious disease. Thecosts per death averted for the latter are typically signicantly higher, which sug-gests that vitamin A fortication would be a very cost-effective intervention forreducing childhood mortality in country P . 9.3.2 Iodine: a cost-benet analysis In the cost-benet calculation for iodine described here, goitre prevalence is used to indicate iodine deciency and the main economic consequence of iodinedeciency is assumed to be productivity losses in those children born to motherswith goitre (see Table 9.4 ). Although in many respects urinary iodine excretion is a better indicator of iodine deciency (it tracks improvements in iodine intakemore rapidly ( 6), at present, such data are not widely available for many coun- tries. Nor is the relationship between urinary iodine excretion and birth out-comes well documented, although it is anticipated that this will become clearerin the future. Based on the assumptions given in Table 9.4 ,the average percentage pro- ductivity loss per birth to a productivity loss in country P , where the prevalence of goitre in women is 15%, is given by the formula: Productivity loss per capita =Prevalence of goitre \u00d7Average productivity loss \u00d7Wage share in GDP \u00d7Per capita GDP . Note that instead of multiplying an average productivity loss by an average wage expressed in units of currency, and applying a factor which equates to the proportion of the population that works in the market labour force, weuse here a simplication, as follows: Weassume that the average wage in the population is given by: Average wage =(Per capita GDP \u00d7Wage share in GDP)/ Employment proportion, where the employment proportion is the market labour force as a share of the total population.9. ESTIMATING THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-BENEFIT OF FORTIFICATION 219If the wage share in GDP in country P is 40%, then application of the above formula gives a per capita productivity loss of: 0.15 \u00d70.1027 \u00d70.40 \u00d7430 =2.65, or US$ 2.65. If the unit cost of iodine fortication is US$ 0.10 per person per year ( 359), then the cost-benet ratio of iodine fortication is 0.10:2.65 or 1:26.5. If thecosts of fortication are as low as US$ 0.01, as has been suggested by Dary(personal communication, 2004) for parts of central America, then thecost-benet ratio will be even greater.This is a very favourable cost-benet ratio.These calculations make the critical assumption that iodine fortication pro-grammes are 100% effective, i.e. that they completely remove the possibility of goitre in the population in the long term. 9.3.3 Iron fortication: a cost-benet analysis The cost-benet analysis for iron outlined below uses the prevalence of anaemia as a proxy indicator of iron deciency. However, it is generally accepted thatonly about half of the cases of anaemia are in fact iron-deciency anaemia; con-versely, there are a considerable number of iron deciency cases that are not associated with anaemia (see section 3.1.1). Despite its being an imperfect indi-cator of iron deciency, anaemia is nevertheless used in this analysis in theabsence of alternative inexpensive and easy-to-apply tests of iron deciency (seediscussion in Ross & Horton ( 365). The present cost-benet calculation further assumes that the main economic effect of iron deciency is a loss of manualwork, i.e. productivity. Based on the assumptions given in Table 9.4 ,the pro- ductivity loss for a known prevalence of anaemia (Pre anaemia ) is given by the formula: Productivity loss associated with anaemia over all market work +Additional productivity loss associated with anaemia in light manual labour +Further additional productivity loss associated with anaemia in heavy manual labour, that is, 4%\u00d7Wage share in GDP \u00d7Per capita GDP \u00d7Pre anaemia in manual share capita GDP \u00d7Pre anaemia \u00d7Heavy manual share. Although the prevalence of anaemia (Pre anemia) is not necessarily congruent with presence of iron deciency, it is nevertheless an appropriate indicator to use heresince the estimates of productivity losses employed (see Table 9.4 ) are derivedGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 220from studies involving iron interventions in anaemic populations, not speci- cally iron-decient populations. According to statistics produced by the International Labour Organization (ILO), in low-income countries light manual labour represents about 70% of allmarket work, 60% in lower-middle income countries, and 50% in upper-middleincome countries ( 366). For the purposes of this calculation, it can be assumed that 57.5% of the work in agriculture is heavy manual labour (based on theassumption that half of work in agriculture and construction is heavy manualwork, and that construction represents 15% of work in agriculture ( 366). If in country P , the proportion of employment in agriculture is 25%, the overall prevalence of anaemia in the population is 37.25%, and light manual labour rep-resents 60% of all market work (the country being in the lower-middle incomecategory), then the per capita productivity losses associated with as a unit fortication cost per person of US$ 0.12 (based on data from Venezuela ( 39), this produces a cost-benet ratio of 0.12:4.04. However, as mentioned above, iron fortication cannot correct all anaemia (i.e. it is not 100%effective), and a further adjustment to account for this fact needs to be made. According to the Venezuelan study conducted by Layrisse et al. ( 39), iron for- tication led to a 9% reduction in the prevalence of anaemia. However, the studywas limited to children aged 7, 11 and 15 years, and was based on a before-and- after comparison, rather than on an intervention/control design. Layrisse's con-clusions are, however, supported by the results of a well-controlled study fromMorocco involving double-fortied salt (with iron and iodine). In this case, for-tication, albeit at a higher concentration, achieved a 15% decline in the preva-lence of iron-deciency anaemia in children aged 6-14 years, for an estimatedannual cost of US$ 0.22 ( 44). If it is assumed that in country P the same absolute decrease in anaemia preva- lence can be obtained as was achieved in Venezuela (for the whole population,not only children), then the proportional reduction in anaemia due to the forti-cation programme would be: 0.09/0.3725, or 24%. So, if the economic benet of averting iron deciency in the population is US$ 4.04 per person, and the cost of fortication is US$ 0.12 per person and the9. ESTIMATING THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-BENEFIT OF FORTIFICATION 221effectiveness is 24% (i.e. a fortication programme reduces the prevalence by 24%), then the cost-benet ratio becomes: 0.12:4.04 \u00d70.24 or 1:8. This is a fairly high cost-benet ratio, and suggests that iron fortication would be a prudent investment in country P . The cost-benet ratio for iron fortica-tion is lower than that calculated for iodine (see previous section). However, ifbenets are assessed in terms of reduced mortality (as opposed to productivitylosses), iron fortication produces the better cost-benet ratio. Additional ben-ets for both iodine and iron, not taken into account here, include improvementsin cognitive development and in school performance in children. 9.3.4 Iron supplementation: a cost-effectiveness calculation Studies have established that iron supplementation during pregnancy is associ- ated with a 11.7 g/l improvement in haemoglobin levels. In turn, a 10 g/l improvement in haemoglobin levels is associated with an odds ratio of 0.80 formaternal mortality rates (MMR), and an odds ratio of 0.84 for perinatal mor-tality rates (taken as 40% of the infant mortality rate (IMR)). Based on thesedata (see Table 9.4 ), it can be assumed that iron supplementation in pregnancy produces a reduction in the MMR from 200/100 000 to 137/100 000 live births (or from 2 to 1.37 per 1000 live births ), and a reduction of the perinatal mor- tality rate from 32 per 1000 to 23 per 1000 live births . Hence, for an investment of US$ 1700 per 1000 pregnancies, 9.63 deaths are averted (9 perinatal deaths and 0.63 maternal mortalities).This equates to a cost per death averted of US$ 176.5. While on the surface it appears that iron supplementation during pregnancy is a less cost-effective strategy than vitamin A fortication in children (the costper death averted is about 10 times higher - see section 9.3.1), it should beremembered that iron supplementation also has immediate productivity bene-ts that would not be conferred by vitamin A.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 222Summary Thecost-effectiveness of an intervention is expressed in terms of the cost of achiev- ing a specied outcome. Analyses of cost-effectiveness are particularly useful for com- paring different interventions that share the same outcome. In assessments of healthinterventions, the two most widely used effectiveness measures are \"cost per death averted\" and the \"cost per disability adjusted life-year saved\" (cost per DAL Y saved). Both measures can be applied to micronutrient interventions. Although the lattermeasure combines mortality and morbidity outcomes into a single indicator, its cal- culation is generally more demanding in terms of data needs and assumptions. A cost-benet analysis compares the monetary cost of an intervention with the mon- etary value of a specied outcome (i.e. the benet). Because cost-benet analyses are able to compare interventions whose potential benets or outcomes extend beyond health, they can be used to evaluate the relative merits of health interventions andother kinds of government spending. Cost-benet analyses are thus especially helpful for advocating for increased resources for nutrition and health. Cost-effectiveness and cost-benet analyses have shown that: Both iodine and iron fortication have the potential to achieve high cost-benet ratios, given the prevailing levels of micronutrient deciency and the economic situation of many low-income countries. Food fortication with vitamin A is highly cost-effective in reducing mortality in chil- dren, as is supplementation with iron in pregnant women. Fortication becomes increasingly cost-effective the higher the proportion of the population in need of the intervention.9. ESTIMATING THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-BENEFIT OF FORTIFICATION 223CHAPTER 10 Communication, social marketing, & advocacy in support of food fortication programmes In common with other health promotion programmes, all food fortication programmes share two objectives: (i) to create an enabling environment - in this case, one that makes adequately fortied foods widely available and provides the means for individuals toacquire them; (ii) to help individuals adopt healthful behaviours - in this case, behaviours that enhance the contribution of fortied foods to their micronutrient status. Fullment of these objectives not only requires political commitment and cor- porate support, but also that national laws and regulations, manufacturing and marketing practices, and community norms, policies and structures bestrengthened or modied in some way so as to bring adequately fortied foods to those who need them most. Furthermore, individuals are likely to needguidance and encouragement before they willingly incorporate fortied prod-ucts into their diets, modify their dietary practices that affect the absorption ofnutrients in foods, and adopt household storage and cooking techniques that maximize the nutrient value of the foods they eat. Throughout the entirety ofthis individual behaviour-environment change continuum, communication playsa critical role. Toincrease its chances of success, a fortication programme needs to be supported by a range of well-coordinated communication activities that promoteindividual, community, corporate and political change. In this respect it is important to be aware that messages about the benets of fortication can becommunicated in a number of different ways, using a variety of techniques, toverydifferent effect depending on the intended audience. By outlining some of the options available, the main purpose of this chapter is, therefore, to help micronutrient programme managers understand the different communica-tion needs of various sectors and so direct their communication activities moreefciently. 22410.1 Communication strategies: the options There are a number of recognized methodologies that are available to pro- gramme managers for communicating messages about the benets of micro- nutrient fortication; these include nutrition education, social marketing andadvocacy (see Table 10.1 ). Experience has shown some approaches to be par- ticularly useful for encouraging individuals to adopt healthier behaviours (e.g.health communication, nutrition education, social marketing); others havehelped foster community support, led to the introduction of laws or regulationsor mobilized entire countries for periodic health actions (e.g. advocacy, socialmobilization). In practice, however, it is not simply a question of choosing oneapproach over another, but nding the right blend of strategies and tactics thattogether achieve programme objectives ( 367). A useful framework for analysing communication needs, in which education, marketing and legislation are viewed as interconnected approaches to managingsocial and health issues, has been suggested by Rothschild ( 373). By describing the relationship between various activities in terms of individual decision-makingand perceived costs and benets ( Figure 10.1 ), Rothschild's framework can assist in identifying which approaches are best suited to which tasks.10. COMMUNICATION, SOCIAL MARKETING, & ADVOCACY 225TABLE 10.1 Nutrition promotion methods dened Concept Denition Nutrition Any set of learning experiences designed to facilitate the voluntary education adoption of eating and other nutrition-related behaviours conducive to health and well-being ( 368). Health The crafting and delivery of messages and strategies, based oncommunication consumer research, to promote the health of individuals and communities (V. Freimuth in ( 369). Social \"The design, implementation, and control of programmes aimed at marketing increasing the acceptability of a social idea, practice [or product] in one or more groups of target adopters. The process actively involves thetarget population, who voluntarily exchange their time and attention forhelp in meeting their health needs as they perceive them\" ( 370). Advocacy Persuading others to support an issue of concern to an individual, group or community. May involve, \"the strategic use of the mass mediaas a resource to advance a social or public policy initiative\" ( 371). Social A broad scale movement to engage large numbers of people in action mobilization for achieving a specic development goal through self-reliant effort. Social mobilization is most effective when it is composed of a mix ofadvocacy, community participation, partnerships and capacity-buildingactivities that together create an enabling environment for sustained action and behaviour change ( 372).10.1.1 Education The upper left-hand quadrant of Figure 10.1 is occupied by education or \"pro- viding knowledge\". This approach is most effective when the benets of achange are obvious, and the change does not appear costly to the person orgroup being asked to make the change. It had been assumed in the past that only a minimal amount of communication was needed to \"educate\" the public,opinion leaders in the scientic community and industry about the benets ofadding nutrients to foods. However, experience with salt iodization has demon-strated that in reality a far more negotiated approach is required. Fortied products are developed to address a biological need for micronutri- ents. However, at the individual level this need is largely unrecognized becausepeople neither crave micronutrients nor realize that they are decient. Instead,a population's need for micronutrients is dened by the health community,usually in terms of a biochemical, clinical or some other marker of deciency.Since raw data on the prevalence of deciency are often difcult for the generalpublic to understand, by themselves they do not sufce for providing individu-als with a believable rationale for changing their shopping, food preparation ordietary habits. What is needed instead is a more user-friendly message, prefer-ably one that is tailored to suit the information needs and cognitive ability of therecipients (see Box 10.1 ). Lack of ambiguity in educational messages is vital. Whenever technical experts disagree, the public tends to ignore all scientic evidence until such timeGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 226FIGURE 10.1 Relationship between individual decision-making and the perceived costs and benets of any new behaviour, idea or product Perceived benefits high Perceived benefits lowPerceived costs low Perceived costs highEducation Law/policyMARKETING Source: reproduced from reference (374) , with the permission of the publishers.a unied message has emerged. For fortication programme managers it can sometimes be difcult to achieve a consensus between competing claims ofeffectiveness, safety, quality and cost of a given intervention. For instance,whereas public health professionals tend to advocate the most appropriate for-ticant levels for maximum impact, or recommend use of those forticant com-pounds that offer the highest bioavailability, producers will try to minimizechanges in product quality and cost. A process which successfully negotiatesthese varying perspectives among public and private sectors is critical to devel-oping a product prole that has the support of both government and industry- and that ultimately will be accepted by the consumer. Hence, at the outset offood fortication programmes, it is important to attempt to integrate and trans-late the technical language and jargon of the public health, food science andbusiness sectors into a common vocabulary that all the various professionals involved can understand. T echnical language and jargon should be reserved forprofessional communications; the public will require a more carefully craftedapproach altogether, and one that is based on the appearance of scientic con-sensus in order to achieve maximum penetration. 10.1.2 Laws, policy and advocacy: communicating with policy-makers In direct contrast to education, and occupying the diagonally opposite quadrant in Figure 10.1 ,laws (or regulations) are used to prompt societal change when a change appears to be costly and to compromise individual benets. In thecontext of health, most laws and regulations are aimed at achieving the collec-tive good over individual desires or prot. Rothschild denes law as \"the use of coercion to achieve behaviour in a non-voluntary manner\" ( 373), but in 10. COMMUNICATION, SOCIAL MARKETING, & ADVOCACY 227BOX10.1 Educationasacommunicationstrategy:keystosuccess Educational approaches work best when the recipient of the information has already expressed a desire or commitment to perform the desired behaviourand is now seeking information on what to do and how to do it.

It should be: \u2014adjusted to the cognitive abilities of the learner (i.e. according to age, edu- cational level, literacy and language of maximum understanding); \u2014adjusted to the communication medium be it oral, visual, or tactile (e.g. mixing instructions); \u2014answer factual questions such as What?

When any concerned group organizes to change a law or policy, their primary tool is advocacy .Thus the recipient of advocacy is an individual or group with the power to change the law or regulation, i.e. policy-makers. The primarymessage that needs to be communicated is why this individual or group shouldcare ( Box tion whe n... making decisions. In reality, many decisions are based on short- term demands rather than long-term study, and policies and programmes arefrequently developed around anecdotal evidence. Existing health data are oftenunder-utilized and sometimes ignored\" ( 375). Some advocacy groups (and indeed governments and corporations) actively court the mass media to draw attention to a particular issue and to present theirstandpoint. Micronutrient programme managers wishing to use the media inthis way are advised to develop good working relationships with key journalistsand thus earn a reputation for being a reliable source of information. It is helpfulto develop fact sheets, press briengs and other background materials that canbe used by the news media, but in order to maximize their impact, these usuallyneed to be combined with a \"newsworthy\" event, such as the release of newdata, a public meeting or a decision taken by the government. Although mediasuccess can be measured by the volume of exposure or \"airtime\", ensuring thata story is presented the way it was intended is equally, if not more, important.This can be extremely difcult as the news media is increasingly an \"entertain-ment industry,\" and what drives story placement is often linked to what bringshigh levels of audience attention. Strategies for increasing media coverage arepresented in Box 10.3 .GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 228BOX10.2 Advocacyasatoolforcommunicatingwithpolicy-makers: keystosuccess Advocacy frames issues for public attention, the media and policy-makers.

Social marketing is the use of marketing techniques devel- oped by the private sector (i.e. commercial marketing) to achieve public sectorgoals. In the area of public health, this technique has been used successfully tosupport family planning, HIV prevention, oral rehydration, hand washing, andimmunization, as well as various nutrition programmes, such as infant feeding,salt iodization, iron supplementation and dietary diversication programmes(376,377 ) Commercial and social marketing are alike in that both attempt to influence individuals to make choices concerning their behaviour, and/or the products or services (the \"offering\") they use by increasing the perceived value of theoffering and mitigating the perceived obstacles to its use. In commercial marketing, consumers buy a product or service that they judge to be a fair trade for the sum of money paid. The prots generated through this exchangeare distributed back to the company that produced the product or service andits stockholders. The term \"social marketing\" is generally used to describe the promotion of those \"causes judged by persons in positions of power and authority to be ben-ecial to both individuals and society\" ( 378). The potential consumer in a social marketing programme might be asked to use a product (e.g. a polio vaccine, avitamin A capsule, soap), a service (e.g. well-baby visit, preventive dental check-up) or adopt or modify a behaviour (e.g. mix an oral rehydration solution, refusean offer of a cigarette, breastfeed exclusively for 6 months). Usually, the poten-tial consumer or \"adopter\" initially feels no need or desire for this product,service or modied behaviour, and, in fact, uses or does something else instead.10. COMMUNICATION, SOCIAL MARKETING, & ADVOCACY 229BOX10.3 Usingthemedia:keystosuccess Chances of obtaining media coverage are (timeliness); \u2014images, pictures, video lms, photographs, graphs, and expert inter- views.When the exchange is completed, the consumer or adopter will have given up time, a previously held belief or attitude, money, or even all three to acquire theoffering. In a social marketing programme, unlike the commercial marketing sce- nario, the return to the \"stockholders\" is better health and welfare for the society.However, when social and private sector entities combine to market socially ben-ecial products, such as fortied foods, a reasonable monetary prot is usuallyalso generated. This means that the venture can be made self-sustaining,and thus avoid having to rely on constant inputs from governments or donoragencies ( 379,380 ). As the objective is largely a voluntary exchange, social marketing works best when it involves potential consumers in every aspect of a programme.Potential consumers need to be consulted about product or service devel- opment as well as its cost (or \"price\"), image (\"product positioning\"), distri-bution (or \"place\") and promotion. These factors are referred to as the four \"Ps\" of social marketing, and are analysed in the context of food fortication inBox 10.4 . Social marketing programmes require considerable investment in order to create awareness of the offerings and to demonstrate their value to potentialadopters to the extent that adopters are willing to exchange their time, moneyor dearly held beliefs or habits for them. Social marketing programmes relyheavily on communication, and need time to develop to their full potential.However, social marketing is not just about communication; no amount of adver-tising, or advocacy, social mobilization, education, information or health com-munication can sell an inferior product that is badly packaged and distributedand/or unfavourably priced. For these reasons, social marketing objectivesshould be dened, alongside other programme objectives, at the planning stageof a fortication programme. Social marketing indicators should also be devel-oped at this time; these can used, in combination with other programme indi-cators, to evaluate programme implementation and performance (see Chapter9). Consumer behaviour and its antecedents can be useful complementarymeasures of programme success. 10.2 Communication to support social marketing programmes As indicated in the previous section, the right mix of social marketing and otherstrategies can make all the difference to the success of a public health pro-gramme. Food fortication programme managers can make use of any one of a number of published resources to guide the development of the commu-nication component of a social marketing programme to support their own fortication initiative.

Product presentation should be attractive, tasty and in all ways appealing to the potential consumer. Positioning of the product is derived through research with the potential con- sumer. It makes a promise that can be kept. Eventually this will become a\"brand\". Price The fortied product should be packaged in quantities and priced so as to be affordable to the potential consumer. Different quantities/price points might be developed to satisfy different groups of consumers. Place The fortied product needs to be widely distributed (including rural areas) using commercial food distribution channels, where appropriate. All physical barriers to obtaining the fortied product should be eliminated. Promotion Product promotion should be driven by the product's positioning. The benets of fortied foods and the limitations of non-fortied substitutes need to be presented in terms that are meaningful to the consumer. The act of purchasing fortied foods needs to be presented as \"new\", and then eventually, as \"normal\". The consumer should be persuaded to adopt consumption practices that enhance the absorption of micronutrients. The consumer should be educated to store fortied foods in ways that protect the product and prolong its shelf-life.programmes from around the world1.In this particular guide, all promotional materials production and messaging is based on a systematic, data-drivenprocess that is centred on the intended audience or the consumer. This processrequires the following activities: Qualitative and quantitative research to dene participating audiences, con- sumer attitudes and barriers to change. Data analysis to dene and segment audiences into like groups for communication. Research and pre-testing to determine the most motivating benets for these target audiences. Message creation based on key benets. For each segment, messages must answer the question, \"What is the benet to me?\" Background and qualita-tive research can dene the key messages that answer that question. Promotions and other activities that are disseminated via channels appropri- ate to each audience segment. This approach can be applied to other communication strategies, including advocacy and nutrition education, to make them more tailored and effective.Social marketing research methods can also be used to interact with all partici-pants in a micronutrient programme, i.e. not just potential consumers, but alsoindustry representatives, and government and nongovernmental organizations(NGOs). The guidance and suggestions for communicating the benets of fortication that is provided in this part of the Guidelines is necessarily generic. It is rec-ommended that social marketing research be conducted in each country orregion in order to identify the right mix of messages and communications thatare going to support fortication programme goals to best effect. 10.2.1 Building collaborative partnerships In some parts of the world, the formation of alliances or networks has led to a more effective collaboration between the main partners involved in the controlof MNM.These partnerships typically include representatives from bilateral andmultinational agencies, international and national NGOs, research and academicinstitutions, foundations and increasingly, industry. The Network for SustainedGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 2321CDCynergy. A communications guide for micronutrient interventions is a comprehensive CD-ROM that helps plan, implement and evaluate communications programmes. The CD-ROM is avail-able, free of charge, from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and can be orderedonline via: http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/immpact/tools/order_form.htm.Elimination of Iodine Deciency1and the Global tion (GAIN)2and the Flour Fortifcation Initiative3are among the better-known examples. The primary role of these alliances has been to mobilize decision-makers with regard to the public health dimension of MNM and to providesupport for food fortication programmes. Within this atmosphere of multisectoral collaboration, the primary role of the food industry is to produce, distribute and market a good quality, competitively-priced fortied product. Ideally, fortication should add no more than a few percent of product cost to the product price, have no detrimental impact on productquality and not create imbalances in the business or competitive environment.The public sector, on the other hand, is responsible for creating an environmentthat allows the private sector to invest in fortication.This enabling environmentshould minimize unfair competition from lower quality or cheaper unfortiedfoods that make it difcult to pass added costs of fortication on to the consumer. Inevitably there will be some tension between the public sector emphasis on consumer rights and on equity and health issues, and the private sector focuson consumer demand, commercial viability and revenue generation. Balancingthe public and private perspectives requires developing communication chan-nels for negotiating a number of potentially contentious issues, such as: Increasing sales is a fundamental goal of private sector marketing. However, this is not necessarily a public or national goal, and for some food vehicles,such as sugar or salt, increased consumption - or sales - is not an explicitgoal of the programme. Messages should lead consumers to the fortiedproduct, but not necessarily to increase overall consumption of the commodity (i.e. sugar, oil, salt, flour). Whereas private companies strive to maximize revenues, the public sector strives to maximize accessibility and minimize any price rise. A balance thusneeds to be struck whereby producers are fairly compensated, while avoidingany sharp price increases for at-risk consumers. Logos and endorsements awarded by governments or NGOs can be power- ful promotional tools. The difculty here lies in the fact that, while the privatesector promotions are designed to maximize market share, public campaignscannot be seen to be favouring specic companies. One possible solution isto use public promotions that are generic to fortication, to the micronutri- ents concerned, to the seal of recognition or to the food vehicle.10.

The role and membership of such a body are discussed further in Box 10.5. 10.2.2 Developing messages for government leaders For many national governments, fortication is an attractive option because it offers an opportunity to achieve national health and nutrition goals that - byshifting the costs to the market - can be substantially nanced by the privatesector. Naturally, government departments and agencies vary in their prioritiesand so some will have a greater interest in certain outcomes than others. Forinstance, the potential for improved productivity and national economic devel-opment will be of particular interest to departments responsible for nance andrevenue. Messages framed by national economic circumstances are thus moreGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 234BOX10.5 EngenderingCollaborativePartnerships:Theroleofa multisectoralforticationtaskforceorcommittee Although informal work groups can provide channels for communication, a more formal body, where members ofcially represent the interests of their organiza- tions, can be more effective in opening communication channels in the right way along the chain - from high-level decision-makers through to consumers.A multisectoral task force or committee is useful for securing commitment,gaining consensus and for coordinating the contributions of various sectors or disciplines ( 380). Participation should include stakeholders involved in the tech- nical implementation of fortication, as well as those offering credible channelsto key audiences, institutions and decision-makers. While participants will varyaccording to national circumstances, the core group might include: government health, regulatory and food control agencies involved in regu- lation, monitoring and surveillance, as well as agencies that deal with special nancing needs; companies involved in the production of the choosen food vehicle, value- added processing, and the wholesale and retail distribution of the fortiedproduct; academic and research institutions (which provide technical input as well as credibility); NGOs (which offer support, resources and channels of communication to a range of constituencies). Consumer organizations.likely to strike a chord with policy-makers working in these areas1.Other exam- ples include: Messages dening reduced health care costs will have particular resonance among ofcials responsible for health budgets2. Outcomes such as improved cognitive ability and improved school perform- ance can be persuasive for agencies investing in educational programmes. Agencies dealing with industrial development or public works are most likely to be motivated by estimates of depressed productivity and economic loss. Depending on national circumstances, some government departments may have veryspecic concerns about the impact of fortication and thus may be prime targets for advocacy. Having identied, through social marketing research, thespecic interests and concerns of each group, advocacy or education sessionscan then be tailored to address these. For instance: In some countries, government agencies are involved in the production, dis- tribution or subsidy of staple foods. Fortication will impact the budget of ministries or agencies responsible for the nancing of these activities. Sometimes the selected fortication vehicle (often wheat flour) is imported, in which case, ofcials may have specic concerns about promoting a productthat has a negative impact on the national balance sheet. Since fortication is more cost-effective when adopted by larger or more modern industries, agencies responsible for small business development maybe concerned about the social and economic impact on small producers, theirfamilies and communities. Creating an enabling environment for private investment often involves pro- viding exemptions from specic taxes and duties. The ministries responsiblefor administering these revenue-creating programmes are often deluged withexemption requests. 10.2.3 Developing messages for industry leaders From the point of view of private producers, fortication cannot be allowed to negatively impact fundamental business goals, i.e. sales and prots. Any new10. COMMUNICATION, SOCIAL MARKETING, & ADVOCACY 2351A number of tools are available for estimating the economic impact of micronutrient deciencies based on national statistics for prevalence, gross domestic product, workforce structure, healthcare utilization and other country-specic factors. Proles ,acomputer simulation developed by the Academy for Education Development, Washington, DC, USA is one such tool. More infor-mation is available through the internet at http://www.aedproles.org/. Another is that developedbythe Micronutrient Initiative, Ottawa, Canada, details of which are given in the report titled, Economic consequences of iron deciency (365). 2The Proles simulation (see above) includes a methodology for measuring the reduction in health expenditures.product launch carries with it the risk of consumer resistance and, therefore, a loss of sales and reduced prots. Messages for industry can address this concernbyhighlighting past successful commercial experiences or ongoing trials that indicate little or no consumer resistance to fortied products. Although from the consumer perspective, fortication usually entails only a verysmall annual cost, for a large producer, it can mean a large initial invest- ment. T o help overcome any reticence on the part of industry to make the nec-essary investment, messages directed at the industry sector need to stress publicsector commitment to creating an \"enabling market environment\", that is to say, one that allows business to make a reasonable prot or at the very least recouptheir investment.While this involves a number of technical, commercial and reg-ulatory factors, a key element is the creation of consumer awareness and demand. Therefore, messages to industry should also highlight public sectorcommitment to developing communication channels and to providing supportfor credible health claims and public endorsements, such as ofcial logos. Beyond the basic messages about enabling conditions of sales and prots, a number of other messages may be useful for securing industry commitment tofortication programmes. Again, depending on the results of research involvingindustry and government sector representatives, messages that express the fol-lowing ideas may be helpful: In the eyes of public or government relations departments, the promise of an improved public image and better government relations is often perceived asa benet to business. For technical audiences, fortication could be presented as an opportunity to improve product quality. For example, in the case of flour millers, addingmicronutrients can be framed as restoring milled flour to the original nutri-tional quality of the whole grain. For production managers in developing countries, reference to fortication in North America and Europe can suggest industry best practice. For some companies, expanded market share and consumer brand loyalty may be perceived as a potential business benet of fortication. However,although some companies may benet more than others, there is little evi-dence that national fortication increases sales overall. Nor should the power of the argument that fortication is \"Doing the right thing\" be underestimated. While largely focused on the bottom line, industrydoes have a social conscience. Moreover, industry is very concerned about con-sumer awareness and the reaction to a new product. This interest is not con-ned to the industry sector; policy-makers and business leaders are also sensitiveto potential consumer reaction. For government leaders, consumers are alsopolitical constituents, and they too need to anticipate potential public reactionGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 236to fortication. Therefore, even though they may not be a direct audience for advocacy, understanding the consumer is critical to answering the concerns ofleadership audiences and for developing effective messages. 10.2.4 Developing consumer marketing strategies and education The goal of consumer marketing and education is to create a perception of value in fortication, so that consumers will accept the new product, choose fortiedover non-fortied products, and if necessary, pay a slightly higher price. Creat- ing consumer demand for fortied foods, particularly among lower income consumers, can encounter steep barriers, especially in a highly-competitive environment (see Box 10.6 ).10. COMMUNICATION, SOCIAL MARKETING, & ADVOCACY 237BOX10.6 Fortiedproductsandconsumerbarriers Possible consumer barriers to fortied foods and products include the following: Research in many countries indicates that nutritional benets, while an impor- tant feature, is a low purchase priority. Price, taste, packaging, accessibilityand convenience are almost invariably of higher priority. The need for micronutrients is often unrecognized by the consumer, and must be made visible. This is a difcult task. The benets of fortication are subtle. Because fortied foods offer a pre- ventive rather than a therapeutic benet, no immediate satisfaction is felt.Moreover, benets such as improved school performance and greater pro- ductivity accrue only years into the future. Promoting prevention and future benets is often particularly challenging. While the incremental price increase associated with fortication is nearly invis- ible, low-income consumers are keenly sensitive to any price differential. Con- sumers, particularly the poor who tend to be at the greatest risk of MNM, are also the most likely to purchase cheaper products or to seek alternatives. Staple foods are often seen as pure or natural products. Consumer resist- ance may emerge from misinformation about adding \"foreign\" substances or \"additives.\" These range from apprehensions about toxicity or changes in the sensory qualities of a food, to fears about the true goal of the fortica-tion programme. Staple foods and condiments are part of cultural identity and consumers may simply resist giving up the old for the new. In some cases, there is resistance from sometimes more affluent market seg- ments who feel that they do not need additional micronutrients, and believethey are being forced to purchase and consume fortied products.Consumer marketing strategies can be divided into two categories, \"push\" and \"pull\". A push or supply-driven strategy pre-empts the choice between a forti- ed and unfortied product by universal, and usually mandatory, regulation. Intheory, while prices may rise as a result of the introduction of mandatory forti-cation, there will be no price difference between competitive products as aresult of fortication. With little consumer choice or price competition, the con-sumer plays a less active role and thus communication strategies need to focuson ensuring consumer acceptance, awareness and education. When fortied foods compete with less expensive non-fortied products in the market-place, a demand-driven or pull strategy is needed. In this scenario, a perception of value must be created to compensate for the price difference andthe fortied product must be positively differentiated from the competition inorder to develop an active consumer preference. Communication strategiesfocused on generic consumer awareness and understanding may not always besufcient and sometimes more aggressive commercial marketing techniques arerequired in order to provide a competitive edge for fortied products. A collaborative alliance of government, industry and NGO representatives, along the lines previously described (see section 10.2.1) offers opportunities to reach consumers through a broad mix of public and private sector commu-nication channels. These range from government broadcast television and radio,through health or outreach centres, to various points of sale. Each of thesesectors also brings their own distinct brand of experience and expertise: publicsector agencies and many NGOs have long experience in health and nutritioncommunications, and in public education activities to raise health awareness andpromote healthy behaviours. The private food sector provides expertise in con-sumer marketing, with which to create product demand and consumer pur-chasing preference. Opening multisectoral channels of communication andcooperation is central to capitalizing on the unique strengths of each sector. 10.3 Sustaining the programme Even after fortied products have been launched and established in the marketplace, consumer and professional awareness remains critical to sustaining for-tication programmes. Maintaining consumer support ensures that when governments change, fortication-friendly policies are sustained. Likewise,consumer awareness will help to secure stable and continued industry supportdespite changes in market conditions which may tempt companies to withdrawfrom the programme or not comply with regulations, despite initially support-ing fortication. Continued collaboration between organizations and agencies involved in com- munications and quality assurance is also vital to sustaining interest in fortica-tion. For example, when awarding public sector symbols - logos, seals ofGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 238approval or other forms of endorsement - product quality must be regularly assured. The added value of the public symbol is only as good as the productswith which it is associated and ultimately it is the credibility of the organiza- tion(s) standing behind the endorsement that is at stake. In countries where gov-ernment food control and enforcement is not fully functional, consumerorganizations offer a means by which to monitor the marketplace. Under suchcircumstances, empowering consumer organizations to work with governmentand industry - by collecting samples or publishing results of product analysis -can be an important strategy to ensure quality assurance and evaluation. Summary The chances of success of a fortication programme are greatly improved if it is sup- ported by a range of activities that collectively help to create an enabling environment for fortication. In practice this means promoting change at all levels - individual, com- munity, corporate and political. Various ways of communicating messages about the benets of fortication exist, including nutrition education, social marketing and advocacy. Education strategies workbest when the benets of change are obvious (the perceived benets are high) and the change does not appear costly to the individual or group being asked to makethe change (i.e. perceived costs are low). Conversely, regulatory approaches may be more appropriate when the perceived benets of the change are low and the per- ceived costs are high. All fortication programmes will benet from some form of socialmarketing, i.e. the use of commercial marketing techniques to achieve public sector goals. Social marketing is at its most effective when it involves the consumer in every aspect of a programme, from product development to product positioning, placement,pricing and promotion, and is based on qualitative and quantitative research that hasdened the key consumer groups, their attitudes and barriers to change. Messages must be unambiguous and tailored to match the information needs and cognitive abilities of the recipient. Establishing some form of collaborative network or alliance can be a good way of opening and maintaining communication channels among principal stakeholders. This can also provide a forum for negotiating any conflicts of interest that may arise between the private and public sectors.10. COMMUNICATION, SOCIAL MARKETING, & ADVOCACY 239CHAPTER 11 National food law Governments have a key role to play in ensuring that food fortication is effec- tive for the population group(s) most at risk from micronutrient malnutrition,but is safe for the population as a whole. Food laws and related measures, together with a broader food control system, are the primary tools that are avail-able to governments for establishing an appropriate level of control over foodfortication practices. This chapter examines some of the technical and legal issues that are involved in the development of national food fortication law. The discussion focuses on the regulation of the composition of fortied foods and the labelling and adver-tising of pre-packaged fortied food products. Other elements of national foodlaws, for example those dealing with industry licensing, support or sanctions arebeyond the scope of these Guidelines. When establishing provision for forti-cation within national food law, regulators will need to take account of existingregulations on international trade and the global agreements that today increas-ingly govern that trade. For this reason, the chapter commences with a briefoverview of the international systems for setting food standards and the current global agreements on international trade. 11.1 The international context Two global trade agreements are relevant to food, both of which are adminis- tered by the World Trade Organization (WTO). These are: the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agreement); the Agreement on T echnical Barriers to Trade (the TBT Agreement) ( 381). Food fortication measures, whether mandatory or voluntary, are most likely to be covered by the latter, i.e. the TBT Agreement. This agreement recognizesthat: No country should be prevented from taking measures that are necessary for the protection of human health at the levels it considers appropriate, subjectto the requirement that they are not applied in a manner which would con- 240stitute a means of arbitrary or unjustiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail or a disguised restriction on internationaltrade, and are otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In other words, countries may adopt provisions that restrict trade for legitimate reasons - health being one of them - providing such measures are in accordancewith the ve governing principles laid down in the TBT Agreement. These vegoverning principles act to ensure that unnecessary obstacles to internationaltrade are not created. The key elements of the TBT Agreement relating to cov-erage, denitions, legitimate objectives and governing principles are explainedinAnnex F . The TBT Agreement encourages the use of international standards, except where they would be ineffective or inappropriate in the national situation (see www.codexalimentarius.net and Annex F) (382). 11.2 National food law and fortication Food law, operating in concert with the broader food control system, is the mech- anism commonly used by governments to set technical provisions for fortiedfoods, the most important of which relate to their composition, labelling andclaims. (Claims are statements that manufacturers make in order to inform con-sumers about their products.) Food law may also be used to impose broadercontrols on the food industry, and to establish monitoring and public informa-tion systems in support of food fortication. Food law typically has a number of objectives, the most important of which is the protection of public health. Other frequently cited objectives are: \u2014the provision of adequate information to enable informed choice; \u2014the prevention of fraud and misleading or deceptive conduct; \u2014fair trade. Tomeet these objectives, fortication provisions in food law should not only ensure that all compositional parameters applicable to both forticants and foodvehicles deliver safe and appropriately efcacious public health outcomes but also that the labelling, claims and advertising of fortied foods is factual and not misleading, and provides sufcient information to enable appropriate consumption. 11.2.1 Forms of food law: legislation, regulation and complementary measures Food law commonly comprises proclaimed or decreed legislation that establishes the legal framework and the broad principles, accompanied by subordinate 11. NATIONAL FOOD LAW 241technical regulations that give detailed effect under or within such legislation. Thus food fortication requirements may be established either in an act of thegoverning legislature (such as a food- or health-related act), or in technical food regulations. An example of an act that is solely dedicated to mandatory forti-cation is the Philippines' Act Promoting Salt Iodization Nationwide ( 6). This law establishes policy, applicability, industry support, public information andsanctions, and is supported by rules and regulations for the implementation ofsalt iodization and related purposes; these rules include a technical standard foriodized salt. Other countries use technical regulations (also called standards orother such similar terms), to mandate the specic legal requirements for foodfortication, but rely on parent legislation to ensure appropriate implementa-tion. One advantage of setting fortication provisions in regulation, rather thanin legislation, is that amendments can be made more quickly and easily, pro-viding of course, that the power to administer regulations is delegated from theprimary governing legislature to an appropriate subsidiary or statutory body. Regardless of the way in which national food law is constructed, all those involved in the food production and distribution system (including importers)must understand the applicable laws and, above all, comply with them. T o thisend, and to ensure that food law achieves its public health objectives, it must be: \u2014certain in its operation (i.e. clearly and unambiguously expressed for those engaged in the activity to which the regulation is directed); \u2014supported by an appropriately structured and resourced information dis- semination system and enforcement capability. Under certain circumstances, complementary measures to government legisla- tion or regulation can be used to full regulatory objectives.These measures takethe form of industry self-regulation or a co-regulatory mechanism betweenindustry and government in which government decides the appropriate level ofinvolvement. Such measures are respectively administered by industry alone orjointly by industry and the government sector, and are best suited to matters ofprocess or intermediate outcome. A complementary system only works wellwhen the following recognized \"success factors\" are present: \u2014the level of risk to public health and safety, or potential harm to consumers, is low; \u2014the product is relatively homogeneous across the product category and consumers can readily identify it with the industry; \u2014the industry is competitive, but also cohesive and represented by an active industry association; \u2014the industry and/or its association is responsive to consumer complaints;GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 242\u2014companies are keen to enhance their future viability and are concerned about their reputations, future customers and the wider community. 11.2.2 Regulating food fortication: general considerations Before deciding on the format and detail of fortication provisions, it is vital that regulators understand the factors that shape their country's food supply pat-terns. Important considerations might include the balance between domestically-produced and imported fortied products; the micronutrient composition of theimported product; the capacity of the domestic industry to produce or increaseproduction of the fortied product; and the industry's overall cohesiveness.Having this understanding is especially pertinent if imported fortied productsare going to make a signicant contribution to the intake of micronutrients. Ifcompositional parameters in national regulation do not accommodate the forti-ed imports (e.g. if the minimum iron fortication level set by a newly-introduced law was higher than the iron content of the imported product),an unintended diminution of micronutrient supply may occur, unless the domestic industry can quickly ll the gap. Regulators also need to be aware of the present level of community nutri- tional knowledge and any planned nutrition education initiatives, so as to be ableto determine the appropriate balance between label information and education,and the type and amount of information required or permitted in labelling andadvertising. In this regard, and as previously indicated, regulators also need tobear in mind their obligation to international trade agreements and to interna-tional standards (see section 11.1). Finally, any amendment of a food law that requires industry to change its pro- duction practices and/or product labelling should incorporate a transitionperiod. It inevitably takes some time before all domestic manufacturers andimporters become aware of new regulatory requirements and are able to modifytheir production and/or labelling operations accordingly. It may also be appro-priate for foods produced in accordance with a previous version of the law tocontinue to be sold for a given period. 11.3 Mandatory fortication If a food product is subject to mandatory fortication, then the manufacturer islegally obliged to add one or more micronutrients to that food. Mandatory for-tication can reach the general population or an identied target group, depend-ing on the consumption pattern of that food. For instance, fortication of a staplefood, such as wheat flour, would increase the majority of the population's intakeof a forticant micronutrient, whereas fortication of, say, formula infant milk or complementary foods would increase the micronutrient intake of a 11. NATIONAL FOOD LAW 243specic population group only. The conditions appropriate to the selection of mandatory fortication as either a population wide (mass) or specic population group (target) intervention were discussed in Chapter 2 of these Guidelines. Mandatory fortication is written into food law, usually in the form of regu- lation which species a legal minimum, and where appropriate, a legal maximumlevel for each micronutrient in the identied food or category of foods. Provid-ing there are no technological impediments, one food or category of foods couldbe required to contain several added micronutrients.This tends to apply to foodstargeted at specic population groups having multiple nutritional needs andwhose food variety may be limited. 11.3.1 Composition In its simplest form, a regulatory requirement governing the composition of a fortied food might be written as follows: [Nominated food ] must [ contain ]: (i) no less than [ x] mg/kg of [ micronutrient name ], and, where appropriate(ii) no more than [ y] mg/kg of [ micronutrient name ]. Each of the key terms (i.e. those in italic typeface) are discussed in more detail below, with particular reference to the implications for, and possible approachesto, mandatory regulation. 11.3.1.1 The nominated food The name of the food or food category selected for fortication must be gen-erally and unambiguously understood, or else explicitly dened or described inthe regulation. The identity of the selected food(s) should correspond to thefood(s) used to derive the level of fortication required to achieve pre-set pro-gramme nutritional goals (see section 7.3). Matching as closely as possible to the identity of the foods used in the calculations enables more accurate predic-tions of programme impact on micronutrient intake to be made. Potential areas of ambiguity or difculty to be aware of include the following: The denition of a food or a food category may be as broad or as narrow as required. For example, the nominated food could simply be given as \"flour\",which might mean all flours derived from all types of grain available in acountry. Alternatively, a much narrower description could be employed, forinstance, \"all flour from one or more [specied] grains\", or \"flour having [par-GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 244ticular compositional characteristics]\" (which might be dened by extraction rates); or \"flour destined for [a particular use], such as bread making. Where necessary, regulations should stipulate whether they apply to foods sold only at the retail level, or only at the wholesale level (for use as ingredi-ents in processed foods), or both. However, more precise descriptions offoods or food categories, in the form of say, \"food ingredient destined for [aparticular purpose]\", for example, bread-making flour or table salt, will auto-matically determine the market level at which the bulk of the product is sold. If necessary, the use of mandatorily fortied wholesale ingredients in certain processed foods could be more precisely controlled by stipulating that suchingredients either should always be or should never used be in particularfoods, depending on the level of dietary intake of a given micronutrient thatfortication is designed to achieve. 11.3.1.2 \"Contain\" or similar term The term \"contain\", or some such similar term, refers to the total amount of micronutrient in the food. In other words, the legal minimum and maximumlevels apply to the amount of both naturally-occurring and forticant micronu-trient present in a food, not just to the amount of forticant that is added. Thisapproach suits those micronutrients whose different chemical forms have similarbioavailabilities; more complex regulation is needed in cases where there are sig-nicant differences in bioavailability between naturally-occurring and forticantforms of the micronutrient in question. Food manufacturers can adopt slightly different strategies for calculating the amount of micronutrient that needs to be added in order to exceed the minimumrequirement depending on whether or not a maximum level is also establishedbyregulation. In cases where only a minimum requirement is set, and provid- ing that the cost of the forticant is not prohibitive, manufacturers can ignore afood's natural content of a given micronutrient, thus risking exceeding the legalminimum by at least the natural content. However, if a total maximum level ofmicronutrient is also prescribed, the food's natural content must be taken intoaccount to ensure the total does not exceed the maximum permissible limit. Incases where the natural content is likely to be negligible, the legal minimum (x)and maximum levels (y) approximate to the range of permitted micronutrientaddition. 11.3.1.3 Legal minimum and maximum levels Procedures for determining the legal minimum (x) and maximum (y) totalmicronutrient content of a fortied food are set out in Chapter 7 of these Guide-lines. In conceptual terms, legal minimum levels are established on the basis of11. NATIONAL FOOD LAW 245efcacy, whereas maximum levels are determined on the basis of safety or other more conservative criteria. Both the legal minimum and the maximum levelserve to protect human health, and thus could be used to justify any restrictions on trade under the relevant international trade agreements. Sometimes manufacturers need to add extra amounts of micronutrient (an overage) to account for any subsequent losses of forticant during production, storage and distribution, thereby ensuring that the food meets at least the legalminimum at the relevant distribution point. When calculating overages, manu-facturers should bear in mind any maximum levels that may also apply to the food at that same distribution point. The regulatory limits (i.e. the minimum and maximum levels) represent the extremes of the total permitted micronutrient content of the fortied food at thepoint(s) in the distribution chain to which the regulation applies. Generally thisis taken to be at the point of retail sale. Theoretically then, no individual foodsample taken for testing from a retail outlet should have a micronutrient contentoutside of these boundaries. However, as explained elsewhere in these Guide-lines, in some countries regulatory monitoring or enforcement policies may allowa small dened deviation or tolerance from the legal requirements as appropri-ate to the prevailing conditions (see Chapter 8). 11.3.1.4 Name of micronutrient The term used to identify the added micronutrient can have signicant rami- cations for both manufacturers and those involved in related monitoring activ-ities. Usually the generic name of the micronutrient, for example, \"iodine\", isused; this generally corresponds to that which is measured in laboratory analy-sis for monitoring purposes. However, most analytical methods employed in thefood control system do not discriminate between naturally-occurring and forti-cant forms of a micronutrient (a notable exception being folic acid). Many commercial micronutrient forticants contain other chemical entities that contribute to the molecular weight (MW) of the compound. For example,iodine is commercially available as potassium iodate (KIO 3,M W =214), of which about 60% is iodine, or as potassium iodide (KI, MW =166), of which about 76% is iodine. A regulatory requirement expressed as \"mg/kg of [micronu-trient name]\", refers to the amount of micronutrient (i.e. iodine), not to theamount of the chemical compound (e.g. potassium iodate).This form of expres-sion thus ensures that the same amount of the actual micronutrient is added, irrespective of the chemical composition of the forticant compound used. Forexample, salt fortication with iodine at a level of 20mg iodine/kg of salt (assum-ing a negligible natural content) requires the addition of about 34mg of potas-sium iodate or about 26mg of potassium iodide per kg of salt.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 24611.3.1.5 Permitted micronutrient compounds Because commercially available forticant compounds vary in their chemical composition and bioavailability, not all compounds are appropriate for use in allfoods (see Part III). This gives rise to a number of options for regulators: reg-ulations can either include a list of all the permitted micronutrient forticantcompounds (leaving the food manufacturer free to chose which particular com-pound to use), or it can permit the use of specic compounds in given cate-gories of foods. Regulations can go further and stipulate the identity and purityrequirements of the permitted compounds, or make reference to pharma-copoeias and other technical publications that set out such requirements. For some micronutrients, most notably iron, signicant differences in the bioavailability of the various iron-containing chemical compounds can affect theefcacy of fortication and thus the amount of forticant that needs to be added(see section 5.1). Table 11.1 shows how the legal minimum and maximum levels of total iron can be expressed in order to account for signicant differences inthe relative bioavailability of iron from the added forticant compounds throughthe use of multiples of a reference amount. In this example, the minimum andmaximum amounts for ferrous sulfate are given by the sum of naturally-occurring iron and iron that is contributed by the added ferrous sulfate.Regulatory amounts applicable to the second compound, electrolytic iron, arecalculated assuming the same base amount of naturally-occurring iron butdouble the amount of iron from ferrous sulfate, iron being the more bioavail-able from the latter. 11.3.2 Labelling and advertising The purpose of a food labelling is to identify the food inside the package and to provide the consumer with information about the food and its appropriate11. NATIONAL FOOD LAW 247TABLE 11.1 Relationship between legal minimum and maximum levels for iron with regard to its relative bioavailability from selected forticants Mineral compound Legal minimum level Maximum level Ferrous sulfate Natural iron content Natural iron content ++ Minimum amount iron from Maximum amount iron from ferrous sulfate ferrous sulfate Electrolytic ironaNatural iron content Natural iron content ++ 2\u00d7Minimum amount iron 2 \u00d7Maximum amount iron specied for ferrous sulfate specied for ferrous sulfate aThe bioavailability of iron from electrolytic iron is approximately half that of iron ferrous sulfate, so twice as much needs to added to deliver an equivalent amount of iron.handling and use. Basic information such as product name; \"use by\" or \"best before\" date; storage instructions and directions for use; and ingredient list is asfor all foods and is not discussed further in these Guidelines. In this context consideration may be given to the Codex General Standard for the Labelling ofPre-packaged Foods ( 383). In the case of fortied foods, governments may establish regulations on labelling, claims and advertising requiring manufacturers to provide certainnutritional information to consumers. The usefulness and detail of such infor-mation will depend on the level of nutritional knowledge of target consumers, the assigned role of the label in fullling educational objectives of the fortica-tion programme and the cost-effectiveness of this approach compared with alter-native communication strategies. 11.3.2.1 Micronutrient declaration How much qualitative or quantitative nutritional information, such as a stan-dardized listing of the nutrient content of a fortied food, to include on the label(apart from any reference to the micronutrient in the name of the food such as\"iodized\" or \"iron-enriched/fortied\" or its declaration as a forticant ingredi-ent) is an important decision for regulators. Such decisions should be made inthe context of the target population's nutritional knowledge and future nutritioneducation initiatives. For instance, symbols or pictorial presentations, rather thanquantitative information, may be more efcacious among target populations with a high illiteracy rate and/or comparatively little knowledge of nutrition. The costburden of providing nutritional information, initially borne by the manufacturer but subsequently passed to the consumer, is another factor to consider. Several Codex texts provide general guidance regarding labelling and claims and maybe helpful to regulators; these are the Codex Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling(342) and the Codex Guidelines for Use of Nutrition Claims ( 343) (see also Annex F ). Quantitative micronutrient declaration requirements can pose a particular challenge to manufacturers and regulators because of the labile nature of somemicronutrients with time. In many regulatory systems, the veracity of label infor-mation applies to the product at the point of sale; external monitoring for com-pliance also tends to occur at this stage. Specic mention of such matters ismade in section 3.5 of the Codex Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling ( 342). Reg- ulators may also wish to consider the need for \"best before\" dates on long shelf-life fortied foods, especially if the non-fortied versions are exempt from date marking (e.g. solid sugars or food grade salt). Stipulating a best-before date pro- vides a means of linking the nutrient declaration to the shelf-life period.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 24811.3.2.2 Nutrition and health-related claims Claims are statements that manufacturers voluntarily make to inform consumers about their products. Nutrition and health-related claims focus on the nutritionalproperties of the food, or its nutritional and, where permitted, health benetsfor consumers. Nutrition and health claims are especially relevant to voluntar-ily fortied foods, and are discussed in more detail in the section on voluntaryfortication (see section 11.4.2). Two issues are, however, specic to mandatoryfortication. Although there is little incentive for manufacturers to voluntarilymake nutrition and health-related claims about their products when all the foodsin one category are fortied, if the mandatorily fortied food constitutes only aportion of the entire food category (e.g. table salt vis a vis all salt), then manu- facturers may choose to make lawful claims about the nutritional properties andpotential benets of consumption of their fortied products. Under these cir-cumstances, the issues for regulators are the same as for voluntary fortication (see section 11.4.2). Secondly, some mandatorily fortied raw ingredients are used in the manu- facture of highly-processed energy-rich foods. The processed foods themselvesthus become fortied, albeit indirectly and to a lesser extent. Regulators mightwish to consider whether any restrictions should be placed on the ability of indi-rectly fortied processed foods to bear nutrition and health-related claims thatrefer to, or are based on, the fortied nature of the product. 11.3.3 Trade considerations Prescribing mandatory fortication requirements in regulation may impose trade restrictions on imported products, either because they are unfortied orthey have been fortied differently. These trade restrictions may cause difcul-ties for a country's trading partners. Nevertheless, it is clear from WTO jurispru-dence that not only do countries have the right to determine the level of healthprotection they deem to be appropriate - providing such measures do not unnec- essarily restrict trade - but also the protection of human health is one of several legitimate objectives that countries can cite in justication of a trade restriction(see section 11.1) ( 384). Such considerations aside, different fortication requirements between nations may well create some practical difculties for intercountry trade. Nationsin the same region, with similar public health nutrition problems and food cul-tures, may benet from nding a common position on fortication policy andregulation that could be uniformally adopted. This would not only provide forintraregional trade and potential economies of scale, but also increase the lever-age of the region, where necessary, to source an imported fortied productaccording to the region's particular specications. Although, mandatorily forti-ed food moving in international trade can be imported not only by countries11. NATIONAL FOOD LAW 249with compatible mandatory fortication regulations but also by those countries whose voluntary fortication regulations accommodate the composition of theimported food, the product labelling may need to be modied so that it is nation- ally compliant. The need for labelling modication will depend on the flexibil-ity of the labelling requirements of the importing country. 11.4 Voluntary fortication Voluntary fortication occurs when a manufacturer freely chooses to fortify foods. It is practised widely in most industrialized countries and increasingly indeveloping countries. The extent to which a manufacturer's decision to fortifya food is voluntary and independent does, however, vary depending on themicronutrient and the prevailing sociopolitical and legal environment. In somecases, the impetus for voluntary fortication flows from government - in theform of incentives, collaborative arrangements or an expectation of coopera-tion with specic voluntary fortication permissions - often as a milder alternative to mandatory fortication. In several industrialized countries, the regulations governing the fortication of some basic commodities, such as salt and margarine, represent examples of this particular brand of voluntary fortication. More commonly, voluntary fortication is driven by a desire on the part of industry and the consumer to increase micronutrient intake as a means ofobtaining possible health benets. Perhaps not surprisingly, commercial consid-erations are frequently decisive factors in the development of voluntarily forti-ed food products. Such products are promoted, through labelling andadvertising, on the basis of their health and nutritional features. The proliferation of fortied products that has occurred in recent years could have important implications for future micronutrient intakes and dietary habits.Most signicantly, increased consumption of fortied products may result inintakes of certain micronutrients that pose potential risks to public health.There-fore, governments are advised to exercise an appropriate degree of control overvoluntary fortication, either in the form of food regulation or through cooper- ative arrangements (e.g. a code of practice). The regulation of voluntary forti- cation should not only be consistent with overall regulatory objectives, butshould also take account of the Codex General Principles for the Addition ofEssential Nutrients to Foods ( 385) (see Annex F ). As in the case of mandatory fortication, there are several key issues that need addressing when developing regulations for voluntary fortication, in particu-lar, issues which relate to the composition, labelling and advertising, and thetrade of fortied products. These are discussed in greater detail below, but inessence are as follows:GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 250the range of foods suitable for fortication; the range and concentrations of micronutrients appropriate for different cat- egories of foods; the mode of regulatory expression (i.e. whether there is a need for absolute limits or whether more flexible mechanisms for establishing compositionalparameters would be more workable); the identity of, and purity specications for, the listed forticant compounds; controls on nutritional and health claims as well as advertising, and the appro- priate level of detail of nutrition label information. 11.4.1 Composition 11.4.1.1 Range of foods There is considerable debate and certainly no international consensus regard- ing the extent to which regulators should seek to minimize public health risksdue to MNM, particularly in relation to the range of foods that are eligible forvoluntary fortication. T o date, the debate has centred on whether the choice of foods or food categories for voluntary fortication should be decided by gov-ernments, or left entirely to manufacturers, in which case the prevailing tech-nological and/or commercial constraints - such as whether the forticantadversely affects product characteristics or the cost is dissuasive or prohibitive- will largely determine which products are fortied and which are not. One view is that, without some regulatory constraint, the proliferation and promotion of fortied foods has the potential to modify food choices and dietarybehaviour in ways that are not commensurate with the maintenance of healthand well-being.These concerns anticipate that the commercial promotion of vol-untarily fortied foods would enhance their appeal to consumers who wouldexpect to gain a health benet from the consumption of such foods. Further-more, if consumers responded regularly to such promotional activities, this couldlead to dietary distortions in which fortied foods are favoured over naturally nutritious foods. It might also confound consumers' perception and under- standing of the nutritional contribution of various foods to a healthful diet, andthus undermine efforts to educate them about the nutritional value of differentfoods and the importance of a varied diet for ensuring adequate intakes of essen-tial nutrients. Collectively, these influences may have a detrimental effect on thequantity, quality and ratio of intakes of certain macronutrients, and thus con-stitute a long-term health risk for the population. Of greater concern is the possibility that some promoted fortied foods will contain relatively high quantities of nutrients that are associated with negativehealth effects, in particular, total fat, saturated and trans-fatty acids, sodium or11. NATIONAL FOOD LAW 251salt, sugar(s) and alcohol. The foods most incriminated are those that nutrition policies often advise against regular consumption, such as confectionery, car-bonated soft drinks, sugar-based beverages and desserts, high-salt and high-fat snacks and alcoholic beverages. At present, the concern about the proliferation of fortied foods is largely based on predictions about future market evolution, which are supported by theobservation that manufacturers often use the fact that a food is fortied as apromotional tool. Those who support a liberal approach to the regulation of vol-untary fortication cite the lack of evidence from any industrialized country thathas a well-developed nutrition education system for such an evolution and pastexperience with a liberal approach to the addition of micronutrients. Accordingto manufacturers' data, voluntarily fortied foods currently represent 1-6% ofthe total food supply in such countries, a percentage that has remained stablein recent years. There is also little concrete evidence of any negative effect offortied foods on the overall balance of population micronutrient intake. Suchndings suggest that the key factors to consider when deciding the extent of per-missions for voluntary fortication are the strength and sustainability of nutri-tion education programmes, the level of consumers' nutritional knowledge andthe potential for consumer confusion. The nutritional prole of candidate foods, in particular their content of total fat, saturated and trans-fatty acids, sugar(s), sodium or salt, is clearly one crite-ria that could be used to select appropriate foods for voluntary fortication. However, a flexible approach that also considers the nutritional merits of a can-didate food will avoid the inadvertent exclusion of nutritionally valuable foodsfrom potential fortication.When reviewing candidate foods with respect to theirnutritional value, reference should be made to the recently published report ofthe Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation on Diet, Nutrition and the Preven-tion of Chronic Diseases ( 386). However ,it is recognized that nal decisions about the suitability of foods for fortication will very much depend on thedietary prole and nutritional status of the population and so will vary fromcountry to country. In contrast to the requirements for mandatory fortication(see section 11.3.1.1), the range of foods eligible for voluntary fortication caneither be considered to be prohibited unless permitted (i.e. a positive list), orpermitted unless prohibited (i.e. a negative list). If the risks to health from unsafefortication are considerable, it is probably preferable to establish a positiverather than a negative list of foods. 11.4.1.2 The range of micronutrients and their specic chemical forms A review of the balance between the public health signicance and public healthrisk of individual micronutrients is generally considered to be a suitable basis for drawing up a list of micronutrients that would be appropriate to add to foodsGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 252through voluntary fortication. Globally, the micronutrients of greatest public health signicance are iron, vitamin A and iodine. A number of other micronu-trients also offer broad public health benets or potential benets to smaller population groups (see Chapter 4). There may be some micronutrients,however, whose addition to foods may not necessarily confer any further publichealth benet because of the surfeit of that micronutrient in the existing foodsupply, in which case, fortication serves only to promote the \"image\" of theproduct. Some would argue that one micronutrient more or less would not haveany signicant impact on consumer perception of the product, and that there- fore these micronutrients should be approved, providing there were no safetyconcerns. Ideally, the public health risks of individual micronutrients should be assessed in terms of the magnitude of the difference between some measure of nutrientadequacy and an upper safe intake limit. In recent years, a number of scienticbodies have proposed various risk classication systems for micronutrients,many of which have much in common ( 93). For example, thiamine is commonly rated as low risk whereas selenium is rated as high risk. The classication ofmicronutrients as moderate to high risk does not preclude their regulatoryapproval, particularly as these same micronutrients may provide signicant ben-ets; however, it does signal the need for their addition to foods to be carefullyregulated. It may also be necessary to make provision for a small number of con-stituents, such as vanadium, whose status as essential nutrients is uncertain atthe present time. In this regard, it should be noted that the denition of forti-cation given in the Codex General Principles for the Addition of Essential Nutri-ents to Foods ( 385) refers specically to the addition of essential nutrients. The overriding consideration must, however, be to ensure the adequate nutritional balance of the diet. Having decided on the range of approved micronutrients, regulators are advised to include these in regulation in the form of a restrictive list. Furtherrenements of the permissions or prohibitions on particular food-micronutrientcombinations can then be developed from this primary list. A related restrictivelist of particular micronutrient forticant compounds (i.e. the vitamin prepara-tions and mineral salts that are used as sources of vitamins and minerals), wouldalso be required. Regulators should bear in mind that the potential range of foodsthat can be voluntarily fortied is large, and so too is the range of food pro-duction methods. Therefore, the list of approved chemical compounds will needto be as large as the basic criteria for selection (i.e. bioavailability, safety) willallow. Purity criteria for these compounds will also need to be stipulated. Thesecan be developed at the national level but the task is arduous and resource inten-sive. Purity criteria have been set for most substances at the international leveland so reference to texts such as the Food Chemicals Codex (387) and the British pharmacopoeia (388) could be made instead.11. NATIONAL FOOD LAW 25311.4.1.3 Legal minimum and maximum levels There are two issues to be considered here: rstly, the setting of minimum and maximum levels and, secondly, the amount of food that will be used as a refer-ence for these levels (i.e. mg per kg or per serving). Minimum micronutrient levels should set such that fortication results in products that contain a meaningful amount of the micronutrient, that is to say,amounts that would be expected to contribute a benet when that product wasconsumed in quantities that would normally be expected as part of an overalladequate and varied diet. An alternative approach, which provides greater flex-ibility for manufacturers (and also importers), is to establish minimum claim cri- teria). When deciding which is the more suitable approach, regulators should take into account the health benets that are likely to be gained from voluntaryfortication. The setting of maximum levels is a more complex matter because of the necessity to simultaneously eliminate potential risks to public health from excess intakes of certain nutrients and to preserve the balance of the nutritional com-position of the diet. Decisions about the appropriate maximum limits formicronutrients in foods eligible for voluntary fortication should be based ondietary intake assessments that take account of intakes from all dietary sourcesof the micronutrient under consideration, including that from unfortied foodsand dietary supplements. However, this does not necessarily mean thatmaximum amounts need to be established for all micronutrients according totheir risk prole: not only would this be difcult to do for the full range ofmicronutrients, but the risk of excess intake varies with the micronutrient andwith the level of deciency (and so will be different for different populations).Neither does it mean that the maximum amounts need to be set at the estimatedhighest safe level in each fortied food category. Allowance would need to bemade for the applicability of the upper limits (particularly for the at-risk group),the assumptions made in the dietary assessment (e.g. that supplement use wouldnot become more prevalent), and the magnitude of future intakes of micronu-trients from fortied food. A risk-based approach for setting maximum fortication limits is becoming more commonly accepted, particularly with the development of reference valuesfor upper safe intakes, the approach followed by others is that ofcially recom-mended nutrient intakes, i.e. a population measure of dietary adequacy, vari-ously abbreviated in different countries as the DRI, the RDI, the RNI or theDRV, are better guiding criteria. The reasoning behind the latter suggestionstems from acknowledgement of the absence of need for higher intakes andgreater compatibility with the amounts of micronutrients found naturally in foods.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 254It is apparent from the preceding discussion that it would be unwise to allow the addition of those micronutrients that have a narrow margin of safety in sig-nicant quantities to all or even a wide range of foods. Therefore, the range of foods to which they may be added should be prioritized or restricted in someway; this can be done on the basis of their nature and importance in the diet of the general population or of certain population groups. Regulators who admin-ister systems in which the foods are restrictively listed and may be incrementallyapproved through petition should give consideration ahead of time, if possible,to the most appropriate food sources of these micronutrients. Maximum levels can be established in regulation either for all added micronu- trients, or just for those micronutrients that are associated with a known risk,according to the level of risk. As in the case of minimum levels, the concept ofmaximum claim levels may be advantageous. The rationale behind the use of maximum claims is that they allow regulators to set restrictions on the maximummicronutrient levels that are proportionate to the level of risk and, in the absenceof a tolerance system, they allow manufacturers (and particularly importers)more latitude in deciding the micronutrient composition of foods lawfullyoffered for sale. However, for domestic manufacturers, commercial reality alsoimposes its own constraints in that the manufacturer gains no market advantagebyadding considerably more forticant than the amount that can be claimed. As indicated above, the quantitative basis for setting minimum and maximum micronutrient levels is a very important consideration. There are three possibil-ities that would uniformly apply to all eligible foods. These are: \u2014maximum concentration per unit weight or volume (e.g. per 100g or ml); \u2014maximum micronutrient density per unit energy (i.e. per 100kcal or kJ); \u2014maximum quantity per nominated serving or reference quantity (e.g. g or ml per serving). The use of weight- or energy-based criteria requires making assumptions about respective amounts of solids and liquids, or energy ingested by an average con-sumer in one day. Since these are likely to be broadly similar across nationalpopulations, the potential exists for agreement at the regional or internationallevel, providing the basic approach is acceptable. On the down side, both theweight- and energy-based criteria would cause some products to be unduly favoured or penalized (e.g. energy-rich or low-energy foods, foods used in smallquantities) so that exceptions would need to be made accordingly. The perserving basis has the attraction of being more relevant for consumers, especiallyif the label nutrient declaration is made on the same basis. However, it necessi-tates agreement on the serving size, which is more likely to vary among coun-tries according to cultural food patterns. Agreement on serving size would thus11. NATIONAL FOOD LAW 255be more difcult to reach at an international level, and therefore setting levels on this basis would be more likely to create problems for international trade. 11.4.2 Labelling and advertising As previously mentioned, claims regarding the nutritional properties of fortied food, or its nutritional and, where permitted, health benets for consumers arefrequently made by manufacturers as a means of promoting their products; thisis particularly true of voluntarily fortied foods. Examples of nutritional prop-erty claims are those which refer to a food \"containing\" or being a \"source\" or\"high source\" of a particular nutrient and those which compare the nutrientcontent of a food with one or more foods. Health-related claims include nutri-ent function and reduction of disease risk claims, i.e. they refer to the relation-ship between a nutrient (or a special ingredient contained in the food) andnormal physiological functions of the body or to the reduction in risk of adisease, including nutrient deciency diseases. 11.4.2.1 Nutrition and health-related claims Appropriate regulation of claims ensures that the information manufacturersconvey to consumers about their products is truthful and not misleading. The Codex Guidelines for Use of Nutrition Claims ( 343) provides guidance to governments on the conditions for nutrition and health-related claims andestablishes the general principle that these claims should be consistent with andsupport national nutrition policy. At the time of writing, conditions for the useof health claims are under discussion. Regulating claims about the reduction ofrisk of disease is an especially challenging task and should be tackled with extreme caution. Regulators should bear in mind that anything less than a case-by-case assessment and detailed evaluation of adequately substantiated requests from manufacturers to use disease reduction claims would need to be carefullyconsidered. The Codex Guidelines for Use of Nutrition Claims ( 343) recommend that claims should be substantiated by generally acceptable scientic data, althoughthe meaning of \"generally acceptable scientic data\" can give rise to differentinterpretations. A list of health claims that are considered to be well establishedand generally acceptable would be a useful tool both for the responsible manu-facturer and for food controlling authorities. Ideally, a procedure that allowsupdates to be made within an agreed time frame should be integral to such a list. As an alternative to a list of approved health claims, nutrition and health- related claims may be controlled by setting qualifying and disqualifying criteriathat are based on other aspects of the food. Currently-held views on this topichave much in common with those previously described in relation to the rangeGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 256of candidate foods for voluntary fortication. Although it is reasonable to expect that all eligible voluntarily fortied foods should also be eligible to carry nutri-tion and health-related claims, this approach may introduce discrepancies between the criteria that apply to fortied foods and those that apply to unfor-tied foods, particularly if foods not permitted direct fortication are made fromfortied ingredients. It is therefore useful to consider whether the qualifying cri-teria for claims for fortied foods should differ from those that would apply tounfortied foods (whose claims are based on a natural micronutrient content),and if so, on what basis. 11.4.2.2 Micronutrient declaration Because of the positive perception of fortication by the consumer, manufac-turers usually wish to promote this aspect of their products by making nutrientcontent and/or other related claims about their product. This generally triggersnutrition labelling of the food. Even in the absence of a claim, manufacturersmay choose to declare micronutrient contents in nutrition labelling. Provision of (usually quantitative) information about nutrient contents is nor- mally required under the rules on nutrition labelling; this coupled with infor-mation about the micronutrient(s) with which the product is fortied, would bea minimum requirement. For those consumers who read and understand nutri-tion labelling, the declaration of the forticant micronutrient content in thenutrition information panel could potentially enhance the \"image\" of the food.It should therefore be considered whether more comprehensive nutrition infor-mation should be given for fortied foods in order to provide more balancedinformation about the product. The Codex Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling ( 342) provides guidance to governments on nutrition labelling. 11.4.2.3 Other relevant considerations The labelling and advertising of fortied products should not attribute to themundue nutritional merits. It should also avoid conveying the impression that anormal balanced and varied diet would not provide adequate quantities of nutri-ents, although regulations should allow for the possibility of scientically sub-stantiated exceptions to this. Allowing additional advice on the need for abalanced diet is an another option to consider. 11.4.3 Trade considerations Voluntary fortication regulation, despite being less restrictive than that gov- erning mandatory fortication, may nevertheless limit trade in fortied foodsbetween countries, particularly in cases where the micronutrient concentrations11. NATIONAL FOOD LAW 257of fortied foods do not conform to the regulatory provisions of the importing country, or where fortication of a food category is not permitted or is prohib-ited in the importing country. Different labelling regulations, including those governing nutrition labelling and claims, may mean that product labels wouldhave to be adapted to local requirements. If a common language exists, forreasons of cost and efciency, it would be preferable to harmonize regional reg-ulations. This would bring the added bonus of minimizing such impediments totrade.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 258References 1.

In order to measureprogress made towards this goal, various indicators have been developed ( 1). These indicators can be conveniently grouped into three categories, namely indi-cators related to salt iodization itself, those that reflect the population's iodinestatus and thirdly, those that provide a measure of the sustainability of the saltiodization programme. Success criteria for each of these sets of indicators havealso been established; these can to be used to assess whether the sustainable elim-ination of iodine deciency as a public health problem has been achieved (seeTable A.1 ). 285TABLE A.1 Indicators for monitoring progress towards the sustainable elimination of iodine deciency as a public health problem Indicator Success criteria/goals Salt iodization Proportion of households using adequately iodized salta>90% Urinary iodineb Proportion of the population having urinary iodine below 100 \u00b5g/l <50% Proportion of the population having urinary iodine below 50 \u00b5g/l <20% Programmatic indicators An effective, functional national multidisciplinary body responsible At least 8 of the 10 to the government for the national programme for the programmatic elimination of iodine deciency disorders, with a chairman indicators listed appointed by the ministry of health. should exist Evidence of political commitment to universal salt iodization and the elimination of iodine deciency disorders.

Additional conditions for the use of salt as a vehicle for eliminating iodine deciency disorders are:Local production and/or importation of iodized salt in a quantity that is sufcient to satisfy the potential human demand (about 4-5 kg per person per year). At the point of production (or importation), 95% of salt destined for human consumption must be iodized according to government standards for iodine content. Salt iodine concentrations at the point of production or importation, and at the wholesale and retail levels, must be determined by titration; at the household level, it may be deter-mined by either titration or certied kits. bData (national or regional) should have been collected within the last 2 years.

Its purpose is tosupport the national public health and industry monitoring that contributes tosustaining progress towards achieving universal salt iodization and the elimina- tion of iodine deciency 1. The global IRLI network works to strengthen the capacity of participating laboratories to accurately measure iodine in urine and salt. Its main activitiesinclude: (i) training and technology transfer to national laboratories;(ii) formation of regional iodine networks;(iii) development of technical standards and external quality assurance/pro- ciency testing programmes; (iv) collaboration with the salt industry and other sectors when appropriate;(v) information sharing among regional networks and communications with the IRLI Coordinating Committee and other interested parties; (vi) seeking necessary resources to sustain the operation of regional networks.As of 2004?? membership of the International Resource Laboratory for Iodine network extended to 12 countries, as follows: Australia Institute of Clinical Pathology and Medical Research Westmead Hospital Darcy Road 2871More information on the IRLI network can be obtained by e-mailing: iodinelab@cdc.gov.Westmead New South Rue Haute1000 Brusselse-mail: Daniella_GNAT@stpierre-bru.be Dimiter Nestorov StreetFloor 6, Laboratory 5-6Soa 1431http://www.nchmen.government.bg Cameroon Biomedical Sciences BP 1364Sciences - FMBSYaounde e-mail: WHO.YAO@camnet.cm China National Reference Laboratory for DepartmentMinistry of HealthPO Box No 5ChangpingBeijing 102206e-mail: Guatemala Food and FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 288India All India Institute of Medical Sciences Centre for Community MedicineRoom 28New Delhi - 110 of EndocrinologyDm Ulyanova, 11Moscowe-mail: iod@endocrincentr.ruB.

Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) for use in such computations can be derived from published Recom-mended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs), by the application of the conversion factorslisted in the table below. The EAR is obtained by dividing the RNI (or an equiv-alent dietary reference value) for a given population subgroup by the corre-sponding conversion factor ( Table C.1 ). The conversion is equivalent to subtracting 2 standard deviations of the average nutrient requirement for a population subgroup. The conversion factors listed here are based on standard deviations derived by the United States Foodand Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine (FNB/IOM) and which areused by the Board to calculate its Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs). 291GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 292TABLE C.1 Conversion factors for calculating Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) from FAO/WHO Recommended Nutrient years years years years years years years years years Vitamin A 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 Vitamin Da-- -------- - - Vitamin E 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.3 1.3 1.25 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 Vitamin C 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.3 1.3 1.2 1.2 1.2 Thiamine (vitamin B 1) 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 Ribiflavin (vitamin B 2) 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.1 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 Niacin 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3 1.3Vitamin B 6 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 Folate 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.25Vitamin B 12 1.3 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 Ironb--- 1 . 4 1.3 1.3 1.6 - 1.6 1.6 1.2 1.4 Zinc 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2Calcium c1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 Selenium 1.2 1.3 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2 1.2Iodine 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4 1.4Fluoride a-- -------- - - aConversion factors are not given for vitamin D and fluoride because there is insufcient information to support the derivation o f an EAR for these micronutrients.

CONVERSION FACTORS FOR CALCULATING ESTIMATED AVERAGE REQUIREMENTS 293ANNEX D A procedure for estimating feasible fortication levels for a mass fortication programme 1. Introduction Mass fortication is the term used to describe the addition of micronutrients to foods that are widely consumed, such as staples, condiments and several othercommodities. This can be a very efcient way of supplying micronutrients to alarge proportion of the target population for a number of reasons. Firstly, massfortication does not require changes in dietary habits and secondly, pro-grammes can be based on existing food distribution networks. In addition, staples and condiments tend to be consumed throughout the year, and whenfortied on an industrial scale, the increase in the cost of the product due to for-tication is usually relatively small. On the downside, because staples and condi-ments are also consumed in large amounts by non-target groups, when fortied,some individuals could be put at risk of increasing their nutrient intakes to levelsthat are close to, or exceed, the T olerable Upper Intake Level (UL). This can bea potential problem for nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin C ,niacin (when using nicotinic acid as the forticant), folic acid, iron, zinc, calcium,iodine and fluoride. In practice, the amount of forticant micronutrient that can be added to a food is often dictated by safety concerns for those at the top end of consump-tion of the chosen food vehicle. In addition, some micronutrients, including - carotene, vitamin C, riboflavin (vitamin B 2), iron, zinc, calcium and iodine, can only be added in amounts up to a certain threshold, beyond which the sensoryproperties of the food vehicle are negatively affected. Fortication levels can alsobe restricted by the cost of the added micronutrients; high forticant costs mightmean that programmes are unaffordable or at risk of not being implemented asplanned. Vitamin A (non-oily), vitamin D, vitamin C, niacin and some com-pounds of iron and calcium are among those nutrients whose addition to foodare most likely to be limited by cost constraints. In sum, such limitations on themagnitude of micronutrient additions need to be balanced against the desire toachieve a particular nutritional goal. For this reason, when planning a mass fortication programme, or more specically, when deciding on the level of fortication, it is advisable to rst 294determine the probable safety, technological and cost constraints on the amount of micronutrient that can be added to a given food vehicle. Having establisheda limiting level for each of these factors, the \"lowest\" value of the three then becomes what is referred to as the Feasible Fortication Level (FFL). A method- ology for determining the FFL is described in section 2 below, and its applica-tion illustrated by means of a worked example in section 3.D. A PROCEDURE FOR ESTIMATING FEASIBLE FORTIFICATION LEVELS 295The Feasible Fortication Level (FFL) is that which is determined, subject to cost and technological constraints, as the level that will provide the greatest number of at-risk individual with an adequate micronutrient intake withoutcausing an unacceptable risk of excess intake in the whole population. The FFL is a useful concept in that it can be used to estimate the additional intake that would result from the consumption of a given amount of a fortiedfood, to decide the nal formulation of a micronutrient premix, and to estimate the cost of fortication for each micronutrient added. The FFL is usedas the basis for various production and regulatory parameters that are commonlyassociated with food fortication. Production parameters are applied at foodprocessing factories, and include the Target Fortication Level (TFL), the Maximum Fortication Level (MFL), and the Minimum Fortication Level (mFL). The latter is used in national food regulation to establish the Legal Minimum Level (LmL). Another important regulatory parameter is the Maximum T olerable Level (MTL), which is invoked in food law for those nutrients whose intake might approach the UL as a result of fortication (seesection 2.4). Figure D1 illustrates the relationship between the production and regulatory parameters dened here. TheTarget Fortication Level (TFL) is the average micronutrient concentration of a fortied food product measured at the factory. Food factories should aim to produce products that contain this target level. It is calculated by adding thenatural intrinsic concentration of each micronutrient in the unfortied foodvehicle to the FFL. The Minimum Fortication Level (mFL) is given by reducing the TFL by an amount equivalent to two coefcients of variation in the measured micronutri-ent content of a fortied food at the factory. This level represents the lower limitof the micronutrient content to be achieved by the fortication process.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 296TheMaximum Fortication Level (MFL) is given by increasing the TFL by an amount equivalent to two coefcients of variation of the measured micronutri- ent content of a fortied food at the factory. This level represents the upper limitof the micronutrient content to be achieved by the fortication process. TheLegal Minimum Level (LmL) is the minimum micronutrient content of a for- tied food as dened in regulations and standards; it is the amount that shouldappear on the label of a fortied food. The LmL is obtained by reducing themFL by an amount equivalent to the average loss of micronutrient during dis-tribution and storage, within the stated shelf-life of the product.FIGURE D1 Relationship between the various production and regulatory parameters associated with mass fortication HmL mFL TFL MFL Level (a production Minimum Level (a regulatory parameter), MTL =Maximum Tolerable Level (a regulatory parameter). The graph also shows the Household Minimum Level (HmL), which may be lower than the LmL, on account of losses during storage in the home (i.e. before the food is consumed). This parameter is sometimes used to monitor the utilization, coverage and consumption of fortied foods by consumers.2. Selecting fortication levels on the basis of safety, technological and cost constraints 2.1 Limits to micronutrient additions 2.1.1 The safety limit Micronutrient intake is a function of the amount of food consumed and also the micronutrient content of the food. Since adult males tend to have the highestfood consumption rates of staple foods (and thus the highest micronutrientintakes if a staple were to be mass fortied), this group has the greatest risk ofexcessive micronutrient intakes. In order to assess the risk of excessive intakes,it is necessary to determine the 95th percentile of consumption of the food tobe fortied, as well as the usual nutrient intake from all dietary sources (includ-ing dietary supplements if they supply nutrient forms that are of concern froma safety point of view) for those individuals most at risk - in this case, adultmales. Based on these assumptions, the safety limit for a micronutrient addition can be calculated using Equation 1. Note that if more than one food is being con-sidered for mass fortication, the safety limit should be divided among all ofthem. If the food vehicles to be fortied are interchangeable in the diet (e.g.wheat flour and maize flour, cereals and pastas) the usual intake of the inter-changeable foods can be combined in order to estimate a common safety limit,and in turn, a common Feasible Fortication Level.Equation 1 2.1.2 The technological limit A food can only be fortied up to a level that does not change its organoleptic(i.e. colour, flavour, odour) and physical properties, measured just after forti- D. A PROCEDURE FOR ESTIMATING FEASIBLE FORTIFICATION LEVELS 297TheMaximum Tolerable Level (MTL) is the maximum micronutrient content that a fortied food can present as it is established in food law; its purpose is tominimize the risk of excess intake of certain micronutrients. The MTL should coincide with the MFL for those micronutrients for which there is a risk of excess intake. 1A more accurate calculation may consider losses during distribution and storage, as well as losses during food preparation. However, because losses vary hugely according to conditions and situ-ations, and because allowance is often made to compensate for these losses (i.e. an overage), it is usually acceptable to use this simplied approach.cation and over the shelf-life of the food. This level should be determined exper- imentally both for the food and for products for which the fortied food is animportant ingredient. Ideally, a range of micronutrient levels - and, if more than one micronutrient is involved, combinations of micronutrient levels - should betested by individuals with expertise in the sensory analysis of foods in order todetermine what amount of each nutrient is technically compatible with a givenfood matrix. Each combination of micronutrient(s) and food matrix will haveits own set of technological maxima. T echnological limits are not necessarilyxed; as a result of technological innovation (e.g. the development of new for- ticants that have fewer colour, odour and reactive problems), it may well bepossible to raise the technological maximum at a future date. 2.1.3 The cost limit Of the three, the cost limit is generally the more flexible and adjustable param-eter, being dependent on value judgements about what is an acceptable priceincrease for fortied food products. Most ongoing food fortication pro-grammes operate with price increases in the range 0.25-2.0%. It is recommended that fortication programme managers discuss with indus- try at an early stage of programme development what an acceptable incrementin production costs and product price would be, i.e. one that would make anymass fortication programme both feasible and sustainable. If more than onemicronutrient is to be added, then their combined cost should fall within thispredened permitted increment. When conducted on a relatively large-scale industrial basis, by far the largest share of the incremental cost of fortication (90% or more) can be attributed tothe cost of the forticant itself. This being the case, the cost limit can be calcu-lated according to Equation 2, where the cost of the forticant micronutrient(s)is used to substitute for the cost of the entire fortication programme. Thisapproximation does not apply to some rice fortication processes, which rely onthe use of rice premixes in low dilution rates (1:100 or 1:200). In this case, thecost of manufacturing of the premix exceeds that of the forticant compounds.Equation 2 GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 2981A more accurate calculation may consider losses during distribution and storage, as well as losses during food preparation. However, because losses vary hugely according to conditions and situ-ations, and because allowance is often made to compensate for these losses (i.e. an overage), it is usually acceptable to use this simplied approach.2.2 Estimating the Feasible Fortication Level (FFL) As stated in the introduction, whichever one of the three limits dened and cal- culated as above, i.e. the safety, the technological and the cost limit is the lowestbecomes the FFL. Each micronutrient in a given food matrix will have its ownFFL. Once the FFL has been dened, it is possible to estimate for each micronu- trient the additional intake that would be supplied to the target population, aswell as the probable cost of the fortication process (based on the cost of the forticants), and the nal formulation of the premix (by multiplying the FFLbythe dilution factor). 2.3 Estimating production parameters: the Target Fortication Level (TFL), the Minimum Fortication Level (mFL) and the Maximum ForticationLevel (MFL) The TFL is given by the sum of the calculated FFL and the natural intrinsic content of the micronutrient in the unfortied food. The value of theTFL should be used at the factory level as the target average micronutrientcontent of a fortied food, and thus as the reference value for quality controlspecications. The mFL is derived from the TFL according to Equation 3, that is to say, the TFL is reduced by an amount that is proportional to two times the coef-cient of variation (CV) of the measured nutrient content of a food that has beenfortied by a given process (when that process is performing adequately). Thevariability in the micronutrient content of a fortied food depends on the nature of the food vehicle and the amount of micronutrient added. Generally speak-ing, the inherent variability in the fortication process is lowest for liquids andgreatest for coarse solids. For liquids, a CV of 10% is typical; for ne solids, such as cereal flours, the addition of niacin, iron, zinc and calcium has a CV of15%, which rises to 25% for most other micronutrients.The variability for coarsesolids, such as sugar and unrened salt, is higher still, generally speaking around30-50%.Equation 3 mFL (mg/kg) =TFL \u00d7[1(2\u00d7CV in the fortication process (%/100)] The MFL is calculated in a similar way, the only difference being that twice the CV of the micronutrient content achieved by the fortication process when per-forming adequately is added to the TFL (Equation 4):D. A PROCEDURE FOR ESTIMATING FEASIBLE FORTIFICATION LEVELS 299Equation 4 MFL (mg/kg) =TFL \u00d7[1+(2\u00d7CV in the nutrient the fortication process (%/100)] 2.4 Estimating regulatory parameters: the Legal Minimum Level (LmL) and the Maximum Tolerable Level (MTL) Irrespective of whether mass fortication is mandatory or voluntary, from a public health perspective, fortication levels should be prescribed in nationalstandards and regulations. Such regulations may mention the technologicalparameters described in section 2.3, but it is essential that they refer to thoselevels that should feature on food labels and which should be used for inspec-tion and enforcement purposes, i.e. the LmL and the MTL. The LmL is calculated by subtracting from the mFL the expected losses of micronutrients during the distribution and storage of fortied products. summarizes the calculation:Equation 5 LmL (mg/kg) (mg/kg) (1 proportion of losses during storage and distribution)] It may be necessary to specify a time frame after fortication, during which time nutritional claims must be upheld. In general, most mineral contents, with theexception of iodine in raw salt, should remain more or less constant, but vitamincontents are more liable to change with time, depending on the product.However, such losses rarely exceed 50%, even for the most sensitive nutrients(e.g. vitamin A, folic acid) during the shelf-life of the fortied food. The MTL is simply the legal expression of the MFL for those nutrients for which there may be a safety concern, for example, vitamin A, vitamin D, folicacid, niacin (as nicotinic acid) iron, zinc, calcium and iodine. For other nutri-ents it may not be necessary to specify this parameter in regulations, somethingwhich reduces the complexity of the enforcement system required. 3. Selecting a fortication level based on the FFL: an example calculation A government of a country is aware that most of its population has a diet rich in cereals but poor in foods of animal origin. Consequently, the general popu-lation is at risk of deciencies in vitamin A, riboflavin (vitamin B 2), folate, vitamin B 12,iron and zinc. The government is considering introducing a mass fortication programme to counteract the risk of multiple micronutrient deciencies and to this end has requested its public health nutritionists to GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 300investigate the feasibility of supplying 70% of the Estimated Average Require- ments (EARs) of these micronutrients via fortied foods and to recommendsuitable fortication levels for achieving this nutritional goal. 3.1 Selecting appropriate food vehicles and determining the signicance of food fortication in public health terms Data on the level of consumption among the target population of four widely consumed staples, sugar, oil, wheat flour and rice, are summarized in Table D.1 . On the grounds that they are consumed by at least 50% of the population, sugar, oil and wheat flour were singled out as being the most appropriate vehi-cles for mass fortication. Although rice is also consumed in large amounts bythe population, much of the supply is produced at small-scale, local mills, andthus much more difcult to fortify. Although reasonable coverage can be achieved by the fortication of the three nominated food vehicles, there was nevertheless some concern that up to 30% of the target population might not benet from the planned fortication pro- gramme. The sector of the population falling into this category is that which resides in rural areas and whose accessibility to industrially-processed foods islikely to be limited. Since it is technically possible to add vitamin A to all threevehicles, coverage is likely to be the greatest for this vitamin. However, for some of the other nutrients under consideration, which can only be easily added toone of the three proposed vehicles (i.e. wheat flour), coverage is likely to be sig-nicantly lower. It was concluded that the potential coverage made vitamin Afortication of all three products worthwhile, but that it would be necessary toprovide micronutrient supplements in various forms (e.g. tablets, powders, bev-erages) to ensure an adequate micronutrient intake by that fraction of the pop-ulation not covered by mass fortication (in particular those living in ruralareas). It was recommended that supplements be distributed both commerciallyand through social programmes, and that they should provide the equivalent of70% of the EAR for the micronutrients of concern. The proposed compositionD.

Thus as a rst step in the calculation, it is necessary to adjust theUL that will be used for the estimation of the safety limit for each food as follows: UL per food =[UL (diet and supplement intake)]/3 The intake of vitamin A (in the retinol form) from dietary sources by the target population was estimated to be around 600 \u00b5g per day. This value represents the high end of consumption (i.e. the 95th percentile of intakes). Given that the ULfor vitamin A is 3000 \u00b5g and assuming a further daily intake of vitamin from supplements of 300 \u00b5g (see Table D.2 ), then: UL per food FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 302TABLE D.2 Recommended composition of dietary supplements to complement fortied foods Micronutrient Daily equivalent dosea Vitamin A 300 \u00b5g vitamin B 2(riboflavin) 0.8 mg Folic acid 200 \u00b5gb Vitamin B 12 1.4\u00b5gc Iron 10 mg Zinc 4 mg aThese doses are given as equivalent doses so that they can be used to formulate a daily as well as a discontinuous dose(e.g. a weekly dose). The aim is to supply at least 70% EARfor adult males, which is used as the reference average forthe family. b200\u00b5g folic acid is equivalent to 340 \u00b5g Dietary Folate Equiv- alents (200 \u00d71.7), which means that a dietary supplement containing this dose would contribute 106% of the EstimatedAverage Requirement (EAR) for this particular nutrient. cThis dosage could provide up to 140% of the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) of vitamin B 12in view of the higher bioavailability of the synthetic form relative to naturaldietary sources.UL per food =700\u00b5g. Then, using Equation 1, it is possible to calculate a safety limit for each food. The results are given in Table D.3 . The question then arises whether or not it is technologically feasible to add these levels of vitamin A to the chosen food vehicles. According to the country'sfood technologists it is, and thus it was concluded that vitamin A fortication isunlikely to be limited by technological considerations in this scenario. As food technologists warned that price increases in food products due to fortication in excess of 2% for sugar and oil, and 0.3% for wheat flour, mightmeet with opposition from the food industry, it was considered instructive atthis point to estimate the increase in price that would result from forticationof the three products at the safety limits of vitamin A addition. Table D.4 sum- marizes the results of such calculations. On the basis of these computations, it is evident that the addition of vitamin A to sugar at a level of 12mg/kg is barely cost compatible. On the other hand,of the three food vehicles, sugar has the best penetration (see Table D.1 ). On balance, it was decided to proceed with the fortication of sugar, despite the fact that the relative high cost might make the implementation of this interventionmuch more difcult. 3.2.1 Assessing the nutritional implications of the fortication with vitamin A at the Feasible Fortication Levels The probable additional intakes of vitamin A due to fortication at the safety limits calculated above, at the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles of consumption ofeach food, are shown in Table D.5 .In each case, the additional intake is expressed as a percentage of the EAR, which for adult males is 429 \u00b5g per day. According to the gures given in Table D.5 ,use of a three-food strategy would provide an additional intake somewhere between 28% 1and 499% of theD.

This nding provides justication for the decision to proceed with the vitamin A for-tication of sugar (despite the cost) as without it, the programme is unlikely toattain its nutritional goal of supplying 70% of the EAR to most individuals in the population. The above analysis also demonstrates the benets of fortifying three vehicles with lower amounts of vitamin A rather than just one with a relatively highamount. Adopting the latter approach would not only result in an unacceptablyhigh cost increment, but also increases the risk of those individuals at the highend of consumption of the single vehicle reaching the UL without signicantlyimproving the intake of those individuals at the low end of consumption. Fur-thermore, the coverage of the intervention would be limited to those consum-ing the single chosen food vehicle. Taking into account all of the above considerations, it was decided to select the safety limits of vitamin A fortication as the FFLs, i.e. for sugar, 12mg/kg,for oil, 28mg/kg and for wheat flour: 1.2mg/kg.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 304TABLE D.4 Cost analysis of fortication with vitamin A at the estimated safety limits for sugar, oil and wheat flour Food Level of vitamin A Cost analysis addition (mg/kg) Cost of fortication Product price Price increment (US$ per MTa)( US$/kg) (%) Sugar 12 11.00 0.50 2.0 Oil 28 6.00 0.70 0.9Wheat flour 1.2 0.67 0.45 0.15 aMT stands for metric ton or 1 000 kg.

These parameters are given in Table D.6 . 3.2.3 Establishing the regulatory parameters Regulatory parameters, the LmL and the MTL, for vitamin A fortication are summarized in Table D.7 .These will form the basis of label claims and gov- ernment enforcement activities. In the case of vitamin A fortication, it is nec-essary to set a MTL because of the need to make sure that individuals withinthe population (i.e. those at the high end of consumption) would not be at riskof excessive intakes of vitamin A. 3.3 Analysing the safety, technological and cost limits to wheat flour fortication Having assessed the feasibility of vitamin A additions, the same procedure can be repeated to address the question of the incorporation of folic acid, vitaminD.

T able D.8 provides a summary of the main features of this analysis, which reveals that folic acid addi-tion is limited by safety concerns, vitamin B 12addition by cost, and vitamin B 2, iron and zinc additions by the risk of organoleptic changes in the sensorial andphysical properties of the wheat flour. 3.3.1 Assessing the nutritional implications of the fortication of wheat flour, and adjusting the Feasible Fortication Levels The nutritional implications of fortifying wheat flour at the FFLs calculated in Table D.8 (i.e. as determined by safety, technological and cost constraints) are summarized in Table D.9 .This is expressed in terms of the additional intakes that will result from the consumption of fortied wheat flour at three levels ofconsumption, the 5th percentile (i.e.100g per day), the 50th percentile (i.e. 200g per day) and the 95 percentile (i.e. 600g per day). Intakes are given as absoluteamounts and as a percentage of the EAR for adult males. Please note that thisconsumption pattern is high, and although it is typical of the Middle East andCentral Asian countries, it may not be the case for other countries of the world.Each region or country should make their own calculations based on their ownconditions in order to select the most appropriate fortication levels. The calculations show that addition of folic acid to wheat flour would achieve the goal of supplying 70% of the EAR to nearly all consumers of wheat flour(that is to say, to 50% of the population). The case of vitamin B 12is also favourable, in fact, particularly so. Its level can be reduced to 0.010mg/kg (from0.040mg/kg), which will help to reduce overall cost of the programme while stillsatisfying the nutritional target (i.e. an additional intake of 100% of the biolog-ical requirements (EAR) of this nutrient for almost all individuals who consumewheat flour). In contrast, the addition of vitamin B 2at a level of 4.5mg per kg is not suf- cient to meet nutritional goals, and therefore other sources of this nutrient (e.g.dietary supplements) would have to be supplied to the target population. Thesame is true of iron, and, in the case of reproductive-age women the decit islikely to be even worse, since their iron requirements are greater than those usedin the present calculation. Although fortication with zinc at a level of 40mg/kg would be expected to attain the EAR goal, in the interests of avoiding possible problems with iron absorption (zinc additions at these levels could inhibit the absorption of iron),it was considered prudent to reduce the level to 20mg/kg. This would maintaina suitable balance with the additional iron intake. Any future interventionsshould pair zinc and iron additions in a way that complements the impact ofwheat flour fortication.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 306D.

Background In 2002, the Moroccan Ministry of Health launched a programme to fortify veg- etable oils with vitamins A and D. Prior to its implementation, a National FoodFortication Committee (NFFC), hosted by the Ministry of Health, was estab- lished to serve as a forum for the supervision, follow up and evaluation of theoil fortication programme in Morocco.This Committee comprised food indus-try representatives, university researchers, staff members of government techni-cal standards and inspection units, and representatives from each of thesponsoring agencies. The Committee's rst task was to conduct a feasibility study of soybean oil fortication. One of the objectives of this study was to determine an appropri-ate level of fortication, bearing in mind the overages that would be required to compensate for losses of vitamins A and D 3during storage and culinary treat- ment (i.e. cooking and frying). Forticant levels for vitamins A and D 3were subsequently set at 30IU/g and 3.0IU/g, respectively, with tolerances at theproduct distribution stage in the range of 70-150% of these levels. It was alsoestablished that fortied vegetable oils would need to be commercialized inopaque containers. 2. Design of the QC/QA system Having completed its feasibility study, the Committee reviewed and subse-quently approved the proposed quality control and quality assurance (QC/QA)procedures for the oil fortication programme. These procedures, which werebased on good manufacturing practice (GMP), were set out in the form of atechnical manual. The technical manual provides comprehensive guidance on afull range of monitoring, inspection and auditing activities but places particularemphasis on quality control, recognizing this as being a key component of thefortication programme. In a measure designed to encourage complianceamong producers, fortied oils that had been produced according to the pre-scribed internal quality control procedures were identied as having been doneso by means of a Ministry of Health logo. 3132.1 Hazard analysis and critical control point The hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) approach was used as the basis of the system that was developed for monitoring the quality of forti-ed oils produced in Morocco. The usefulness of this approach for ensuring thesafety of processed foods is acknowledged by both the Codex AlimentariusCommission and the World Health Organization (WHO). It can also be appliedto the management of the quality of food products as this relates to the manu-facturing process; this makes the HACCP approach complementary to otherquality control systems such as the ISO 9001:2000 1. HACCP analysis is a tool that is used to identify specic hazards (i.e. bio- logical, chemical or physical hazards), as well as preventive measures for elimi-nating or controlling those hazards. In the case of fortied vegetable oils,microbiological hazards are unlikely to be a major concern, largely because ofthe absence of water in such products. The potential hazards are more likely to be chemical in nature, for example, contamination by polyaromatic hydrocar- bons or by migration products from the packaging materials. Quality hazardsmay arise due to problems with the rened vegetable oil used as the vehicle forfortication (e.g. high rates of peroxidation, defects in the flavour characteris-tics) or with the forticant compounds that are added (e.g. lumping, colour,odour). The seven principles of HACCP , as adopted by Codex ( 1), establish a frame- work for developing a HACCP-based system that is specic to a given combi- nation of food product and production line. Such a system identies hazards ata series of critical control points (CCP), and then for each CCP , identies crit-ical limits and appropriate monitoring and control measures. The system ismanaged through daily review and analysis of the records for each CCP . It is generally recommended that a HACCP system is periodically evaluated byan external auditor. In addition, the system should be revised whenever a modication is made to the production process, for example, in the wake of cus-tomer complaints or customer surveys that report a product defect. 2.2 Critical control points in the production of fortied vegetable oils Application of the HACCP methodology to the production of fortied oils in Morocco identied the following CCPs; in each case, the appropriate preven-tive measure or action is described:GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 3141ISO 9001:2000 is a norm of the International Standards Organization for the certication of quality management systems in the food industry. It signies adherence to effective qualitysystems to ensure compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to products,and the existence of management reviews, quality objectives and process management focusedon continuous improvement.1. Receiving of the rened vegetable oils (the food vehicle) Action .Each lot should be tested using approved methods to conrm com- pliance with Moroccan specications. 2. Quality of the forticant premix Action. A quality assurance certicate should be obtained from the provider of the premix, and periodic analyses should be conducted to verify thevitamin content as well as the organoleptic properties of the premix (e.g.colour, texture, odour). 3. Storage of the forticant premix Action. The premix should be re-assayed periodically for vitamin content to ensure that it continues to meet the required concentrations until the endof its shelf-life. 4. Addition of the forticant premix Action .The premix use inventory should be assessed, that is to say, the amount of premix used should be compared with the amount of fortiedvegetable oil produced (this is the simplest method). Alternatively, the metering pump should be calibrated by weekly testing and its in-line accu-racy recorded. 2.3 Quality control and feedback systems for implementing corrective actions The following quality control procedures and feedback mechanisms were estab- lished as part of the quality control monitoring system developed for the oil for-tication process: 1. Product sampling and frequency Procedure :Three to ve samples of fortied vegetable oil (collected after packaging) should be taken daily from each production line and the levelsof vitamins A and D 3measured. Levels should be within 95-150% of the declared content. One \"composite sample\" should be prepared daily fromeach production line and kept in an opaque airtight container for up to 3months. These composite samples may be tested for their vitamin contentsbygovernment inspectors. Four samples should be analysed monthly by an external laboratory, and the results obtained used to verify the quality of theprocess.E. A QUALITY CONTROL MONITORING SYSTEM FOR FORTIFIED VEGETABLE OILS 315Labelling of fortied vegetable oils Procedure :Fortied vegetable oils must be identied with a label, which should specify, as a mimimum, the product brand, the batch number, the address ofthe responsible entity, the date of production and durability, as well as thedeclared levels of vitamins A and D 3.Fortied vegetable oils should be des- ignated using the product's usual name followed by the words \"vitamins A &D 3fortied\", or \"vitamins A & D 3enriched\". Any expression of a therapeu- tic nature of the product on the labels is not allowed, but functional nutri-tional allegations for the vitamins A and D 3are permitted. Distribution of fortied vegetable oils Procedure :Producers should be required to keep detailed records about the quantities of fortied oils they distribute to wholesalers and retailers. This is to facilitate the monitoring of the turnover of fortied oils and the assuranceof the declared levels of vitamins A and D 3.Every3 months, about 10 samples should be taken from retailers and households for testing. Whenever devia-tions from the admitted tolerances in vitamin A and D 3contents are observed (30% to +50%), an internal technical audit should be carried out to deter- mine the cause(s) of such deviations. Documentation Procedure :All results of quality assurance activities should be recorded and made available to government inspectors upon request. A recall procedureshould be established to deal with cases of overdosed vegetable oils (i.e. thosecontaining high amounts of vitamins A and D 3) that might pose a threat to consumer health. Inspection and technical audits Procedure :Technical auditing, rather than sample testing, forms the mainstay of the inspection activities. At the factory level government inspection activ-ities should concentrate on the internal quality control and assurance proce-dures adopted by individual manufacturers of fortied vegetable oils. Duevigilance must be given to corrective measures taken by producers to solveany limitations or errors. Attention should also be paid to the productionequipment, conditions of the premix storage and addition, analysis andlabelling of fortied vegetable oils, and product storage conditions. Warningsmust be issued to manufacturers in cases of negligence and deviations fromthe established procedures. If no corrective measures are taken by manufac-turers to ensure compliance, an external technical audit should then be carriedout. \u2014During each visit, between three and ve samples of packaged product should be taken and sent to the Ofcial Laboratory of Analysis and GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 316Chemical Research (OLACR) in Casablanca for analysis. Vitamin A and D3contents should lie between 95% and 150% of the declared levels. At the level of the wholesaler and retailer, inspection activities are mainly concerned with labelling, turnover of fortied oils according to the\"FIFO\" (rst in-rst out) principle, and the conditions of storage and han-dling of these products. Training activities Procedure :One-day training sessions should be scheduled for fortied oil pro- duction managers and government inspectors. The areas that should becovered during these sessions are as follows: techniques of vegetable oil ren-ing; methods for vitamin A and D 3analysis; techniques of vegetable oil sam- pling; factors affecting the stability of vitamins A and D 3in vegetable oils; and the principles of the HACCP approach and its application to fortied veg-etable oils.

Codex Alimentarius -Food hygiene- Basis texts- Second editions .Rome, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 1997: Annex.E. A QUALITY CONTROL MONITORING SYSTEM FOR FORTIFIED VEGETABLE OILS 317ANNEX F The Codex Alimentarius and the World Trade Organization Agreements 1. The Codex Alimentarius The Codex Alimentarius, which means \"food law\" or \"code\" in Latin, is a com- prehensive collection of internationally adopted and uniformly presented foodstandards and related texts (including guidelines) that are commonly referredto as the \"Codex texts\".The Codex texts address a wide range of general mattersthat apply to all processed, semi-processed and raw foods distributed to con-sumers, such as food hygiene, food additives, pesticide residues, contaminants,labelling and presentation, and methods of analysis and sampling. The texts alsodeal with various matters that are specic to individual commodities; forinstance, commodity standards, guidelines and related texts have been devel-oped for commodity groups such as milk, meat, cereals, and foods for specialdietary uses. The complete Codex Alimentarius is available via the Codex website 1. The ongoing revision and development of the Codex Alimentarius is the responsibility of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, which was established inthe early 1963 as an intergovernmental body by the Food and Agriculture Orga-nization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization(WHO). Membership is open to all Member countries of FAO and/or WHO. The Codex texts are developed or revised though 29 subsidiary bodies com- prising regional, commodity and general committees, all of which are intergov-ernmental in nature and most of which are currently active. The committees ofmost relevance to fortication and related issues are the Codex Committee onNutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses (CCNFSDU), which is hostedbyGermany, and the Codex Committee on Food Labelling (CCFL), hosted by Canada.The terms of reference for the CCNFSDU is to advise on general nutri-tion issues and to draft general provisions concerning the nutritional aspects ofall foods, develop standards, guidelines and related texts for foods for specialdietary uses ( 1). The remit of the Codex Committee on Food Labelling is to study problems related to the labelling and advertising of foods, to draft provi- sions on labelling that are applicable to all foods and to endorse draft provisions on labelling prepared by other Codex Committees. 3181www.codexalimentarius.net.1.1 Codex texts relevant to food fortication The part of the Codex Alimentarius of greatest direct relevance to food forti- cation is the General Principles for the Addition of Essential Nutrients to Foods(CAC/GL 07-1987, amended 1989, 1991) ( 2). This section, which covers the addition of essential nutrients for the purposes of restoration, nutritional equiv-alence of substitute foods as well as fortication, provides guidance to govern-ments with regard to the planning and implementation of national foodfortication programmes. More specically, the Codex General Principles for the Addition of Essential Nutrients to Foods by: \u2014providing guidance to those responsible for developing guidelines and legal texts pertaining to the addition of essential nutrients to foods; andby \u2014establishing a uniform set of principles for the rational addition of essen- tial nutrients to foods; seek to: \u2014maintain or improve the overall nutritional quality of foods; \u2014prevent the indiscriminate addition of essential nutrients to foods, thereby decreasing the risk of health hazard due to essential nutrient excesses,decits or imbalances (this also helps to prevent practices that may misleador deceive the consumer); \u2014facilitate acceptance in international trade of foods that contain added essential nutrients. The General Principles state that the essential nutrient:should be present at a level that will not result in an excessive or an insignif- icant intake of the added nutrient considering the amounts from other sourcesin the diet; should not result in an adverse effect on the metabolism of any other nutrient; should be sufciently stable in the food during packaging, storage, distribu- tion and use; should be biologically available from the food; should not impart undesirable characteristics to the food, or unduly shorten its shelf-life;F.THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS AND THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AGREEMENTS 319the additional cost should be reasonable for the intended consumers, and the addition of nutrients should not be used to mislead the consumer concern-ing the nutritional quality of the food; adequate technology and processing facilities should be available, as should methods of measuring and/or enforcing the levels of added nutrients. A number of other Codex texts provide guidance and recommendations that are of relevance to fortied foods. Advice relating to the nutritional quality of foodsfor special dietary uses is contained in Codex Alimentarius,V olume 4 -Foods for special dietary uses (3). Food labelling, nutrition labelling, and claims that can be used by governments to establish their national regulations are covered in Codex Alimentarius -Food labelling - Complete texts (4). 1.2 Recommended levels of nutrients in foods for special dietary uses A series of Codex standards propose maximum and minimum levels of selected nutrients, in particular minerals and vitamins, for various foods having specialdietary uses, for example, foods for infants and children. Recommendedminimum and maximum vitamin and mineral levels for infant formulas are givenin the Codex Standard for Infant Formula (CODEX STAN 72-1981, amended1997) ( 5), and for follow-up formulas the Codex Standard for Follow-up Formula (CODEX STAN 156-1987, amended 1989) ( 6). Rather than pre- scribing minimum and maximum nutrient levels, the Codex Standard forCanned Baby Foods (CAC/STAN 73-1981, amended 1989) ( 7) prefers to leave this matter to the national regulations of the country in which the food is sold. The Advisory List of Mineral Salts and Vitamin Compounds for Use in Foods for Infants and Children (CAC/GL 10-1979, amended 1991) ( 8) sets out rec- ommendations regarding the source of any added minerals, their purity require-ments, and the type of foods in which they can be used. In the case of thevitamins, the various forms are listed (with purity requirements), together witha number of specially formulated vitamin preparations, where applicable. The Guidelines on Formulated Supplementary Foods for Older Infants and Young Children (CAC/GL 08-1991) not only provide recommendations relat- ing to nutritional matters but also address technical aspects of the productionof formulated supplementary foods ( 9). These Guidelines include a list of ref- erence daily requirements for those vitamins and minerals \"for which deciencyis most frequently found in the diets of older infants and young children\", thesebeing the nutrients which should be given primary consideration in the formu-lation of supplementary foods. However, local conditions, in particular, thenutrient contribution of locally produced staple foods to the diet and the nutritional status of the target population, should be taken into account whendeciding which micronutrients to add. The Guidelines make the general GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 320recommendation that when a food is supplemented with one or more of the fol- lowing nutrients (vitamins A, D, E or C, thiamine (vitamin B 1), riboflavin (vitamin B 2), niacin, B 6,folate, B 12,calcium, iron, iodine or zinc), the total amount added per 100g of dry food should be at least two thirds of the refer-ence daily requirement for that nutrient ( 9). In the Codex Standard for Processed Cereal-based Foods for Infants and Children (CODEX STAN 74-1981, amended 1991) ( 10) maximum levels of sodium are dened for different types of products covered by the standard. Itis also specied that \"the addition of vitamins, minerals and iodized salt shall be in conformity with the legislation of the country in which the product is sold\". 1.3 Labelling General labelling requirements are dened in the Codex General Standard for the Labelling of Prepackaged Foods (CODEX STAN 01-1985, amended 2001)(11) and the Codex General Guidelines on Claims (CAC/GL 01-1979, revised 1991) ( 12). Nutritional labelling is Codex Nutri- tion Labelling (CAC/GL 02-1985, revised 1993) ( 13) and nutritional claims by the Guidelines for Use of Nutrition Claims (CAC/GL 23-1997, amended 2001)(14). The Codex Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling are based on the principle that no food should be described or presented in a manner that is false, misleadingor deceptive, and that any claims made should be substantiated ( 13). A nutri- ent declaration, dened in section 2.3 of the Codex Guidelines as \"a standardstatement or listing of the nutrient content of a food\", is mandatory only whenclaims are made. The Guidelines include provisions for nutrient declarations,calculation and presentation. Nutrient Reference Values (NRVs) for labellingpurposes are dened for 14 vitamins and minerals, as well as for protein. The Codex Guidelines for Use of Nutrition Claims ( 14) were developed as a supplement to the general provisions of the General Guidelines on Claims(12), primarily to provide a basis for the harmonization of nutrition claims. Nutrition claims are widely used as a marketing tool but have the potential tocause confusion for consumers. The Codex Guidelines for Use of NutritionClaims specify that nutrition claims must be consistent with, and support,national nutrition policy. Nutrition claims that did not support national policyshould not be permitted. The Codex texts recognize the importance of establishing a link between nutrition labelling provisions and nutrition policy as a whole. Thus the Codextexts on nutrition and labelling, by providing guidance to national governments,allow for the development of national regulations and requirements accordingto the specic needs of the population. Conditions have been dened for foodsthat are a \"source\" of, or are \"high\" in, vitamins and minerals and protein.TheseF.THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS AND THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AGREEMENTS 321provisions apply to claims that are made about any foods, not just fortied foods. When such claims are made, nutrient declaration should be provided in accor-dance with the Guidelines on Nutrition Labelling ( 13), as mentioned above. Conditions for the use of health claims are currently under discussion by theCommission. 2. The World Trade Organization Agreements The World Trade Organization (WTO) is the only international organization inexistence that deals with the global rules of trade between nations. Its main func-tion is to ensure that trade flows as smoothly, predictably and as freely as pos-sible ( 15). By February 2002, 144 countries, which are collectively responsible for more than 90% of world trade, had negotiated their accession to member-ship of the WTO ( 16). Further information about the work of WTO and its agreements is available via the WTO web site 1. The two WTO agreements ( 17) of most relevance to food are the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS Agree-ment), and the Agreement on T echnical Barriers to Trade (the TBT Agreement).Under the terms of both agreements, countries may adopt provisions that limittrade for legitimate reasons; the legitimate reasons can include health consider-ations, provided that such measures do not unnecessarily restrict trade. However, it is the latter, the TBT Agreement, that usually has the more signi-cant implications for food fortication regulations, whether mandatory and vol-untary, and for this reason is the focus of the discussion here 2. 2.1 The Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade: background and general provisions In the 1970s, Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on T ariffs and Trade (GATT) expressed their dissatisfaction with the emergence of new non-tariffbarriers (NTBs) to trade. A GATT working group was thus established to eval-uate the impact of NTBs on international trade, and reached the conclusion thatthe main form of NTBs that exporters faced were in fact technical barriers.During the T okyo Round of GATT talks held in 1979 an Agreement on T ech-nical Barriers to Trade (also called the Standards Code) which governed thepreparation, adoption and application of technical regulations, standards andconformity assessment procedures was drafted. The nal form of the TBTAgreement was negotiated during the Uruguay Round in 1994 and entered intoforce in 1995, at the same time as the WTO.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 3221www.wto.org. 2This part of the Guidelines has been drafted by the WTO's Trade and Environment Division and remains their responsibility.The TBT Agreement is premised on an acknowledgement of the right of WTO Members to develop technical requirements1,and to ensure that they are complied with (through what are known as conformity assessment procedures).However, the objective of the TBT Agreement is to ensure that unnecessaryobstacles to international trade are not created. This is achieved through anumber of principles that govern the preparation, adoption and application ofmandatory and voluntary requirements and conformity assessment procedures.These principles include: non-discrimination; the avoidance of unnecessary obstacles to international trade; harmonization; the equivalence of technical regulations and of the results of conformity assessment procedures; mutual recognition of conformity assessment procedures; transparency. At the international level, the TBT Agreement acts as an important instrument to guard against the improper use of technical requirements and conformityassessment procedures, that is to say, as disguised forms of restrictions on trade.It also guards against the development of inefcient requirements and proce-dures that create avoidable obstacles to trade. In some settings, it can act as amechanism for encouraging countries to adopt less trade restrictive approachesto meeting regulatory objectives. 2.2 Coverage and denitions of the TBT Agreement The TBT Agreement divides technical requirements into three categories, namely technical regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures,which are dened as follows. A technical regulation: a \"Document which lays down product characteristics or their related processes and production methods, including the applicableadministrative provisions, with which compliance is mandatory. It may alsoinclude or deal exclusively with terminology, symbols, packaging, marking orlabelling requirements as they apply to a product, process or productionmethod.\"F.THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS AND THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AGREEMENTS 3231The term \"technical requirement\" in the context of these Guidelines embraces both voluntary and mandatory product specications.A standard :a\"Document approved by a recognized body, that provides for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for products orrelated processes and production methods, with which compliance is not mandatory. It may also include or deal exclusively with terminology, symbols,packaging, marking or labelling requirements as they apply to a product,process or production method.\" A conformity assessment procedure: \"Any procedure used, directly or indirectly, to determine that relevant requirements in technical regulations or standardsare fullled.\" While both technical regulations and standards are technical product require- ments, the main difference between the two is that compliance with technicalregulations is mandatory, whereas compliance with standards is voluntary. A lawthat stipulated that a nominated food must contain a minimum amount of amicronutrient (as is the case with mandatory fortication) is an example of atechnical regulation. Voluntary fortication provisions or a labelling permissionfor voluntary micronutrient content claims are examples of standards. The TBT Agreement contains provisions which ensure that technical regu- lations do not act as unnecessary obstacles to trade. These provisions apply totechnical regulations developed by central and local governments, as well asthose developed by nongovernmental bodies. WTO Members are fully respon-sible for ensuring the observance of all the provisions of the TBT Agreement asthey relate to technical regulations. They must also formulate and implementpositive measures and mechanisms in support of the observance of the provi-sions of the TBT Agreement by local and nongovernmental bodies. Standards are addressed separately under a \"Code of Good Practice\", which is contained in Annex 3 of the TBT Agreement. Most of the principles thatapply to technical regulations, also apply to standards through the Code. TheCode is open to acceptance by central, local and nongovernmental standardiz-ing bodies (at the national level), as well as by regional governmental and non-governmental bodies. However, the TBT Agreement notes that, \"The obligationsof Members with respect to compliance of standardizing bodies with the provi-sions of the Code of Good Practice shall apply irrespective of whether or not astandardizing body has accepted the Code of Good Practice.\" Conformity assessment procedures are subject to many of the same princi- ples as those that apply to technical regulations and standards, in order to ensurethat they themselves do not constitute unnecessary obstacles to internationaltrade. WTO Members are fully responsible for ensuring observance of all pro-visions relating to conformity assessment under the terms of the TBT Agree-ment, and must formulate and implement positive measures and mechanismsin support of the observance of the provisions by local government bodies.Theymust also ensure that central government bodies rely on conformity assessmentGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 324procedures operated by nongovernmental bodies, but only if such bodies are in compliance with the relevant provisions of the TBT Agreement. 2.3 Legitimate objectives Under the TBT Agreement, technical regulations may be developed for one or more of the objectives considered as legitimate by the TBT Agreement. Legiti-mate objectives include: \"inter alia, national security requirements, the preven-tion of deceptive practices, the protection of human health or safety, animal orplant life or health, or the environment\". Fortication measures are most likelyto fall under the protection of human health category. However, the preventionof deceptive practices, which refers to measures that mislead or deceive con-sumers (e.g. false nutritional information given on food labels), might also con-stitute a legitimate objective and thus WTO Members would be allowed to adopttechnical regulations to guard against such practices. The risks associated with legitimate objectives are assessed against a number of factors, including: \"inter alia, available scientic and technical information, related processing technology or intended end-uses of products\". Once again,the inclusion of the words \"inter alia\", indicates that some flexibility may beexercised in the selection of factors against which risks may be assessed. 2.4 Principles which govern the preparation, adoption and application of mandatory and voluntary requirements and conformity assessmentprocedures 2.4.1 Non-discrimination The principle of non-discrimination forms the backbone of the internationaltrading system. The TBT Agreement embraces the GATT principle of non-discrimination, and applies it to technical regulations, standards and conformityassessment procedures. In general, it is the principle that outlaws discriminationbetween products of WTO Member countries, and between imported anddomestically produced products. With respect to both technical regulations and standards, the TBT Agreement stipulates that the non-discrimination principle be observed throughout thevarious stages of their preparation, adoption and application. For instance, a WTO Member cannot adopt a technical regulation mandating that all importedfood meet certain micronutrient standards, if it does not enforce such standardson its own domestically produced food. Nor can it enforce a technical regula-tion on one, but not on another, of its trading partners. In short, under the dis-ciplines of the TBT Agreement and the WTO system as a whole, treatment mustbe no less favourable. WTO Members must also ensure that conformity assessment procedures are not prepared, adopted or applied in a discriminatory manner. AchievingF.THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS AND THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AGREEMENTS 325non-discrimination with respect to conformity assessment requires, among other things, ensuring suppliers' right to conformity assessment under the rules of pro-cedure, including the option of having conformity assessment activities under- taken in situ and to receive the mark of the system. Conformity assessmentsystems must not distinguish between the procedures to be followed for prod-ucts originating from different sources. For instance, systems cannot subjectsimilar products to tests of varying degrees of stringency depending on theirsource of supply. 2.4.2 Avoidance of unnecessary obstacles to international trade The avoidance of unnecessary obstacles to international trade is the principalobjective of the TBT Agreement. With respect to both technical regulations andstandards, the TBT Agreement states that WTO Members must ensure thatneither technical regulations nor standards are \"prepared, adopted or appliedwith a view to or with the effect of creating unnecessary obstacles to interna-tional trade\". With respect to technical regulations, the TBT Agreement elabo-rates on the meaning of this phrase; it stipulates that technical regulations maynot be more trade restrictive than is necessary to full a legitimate objective,taking into account the risks that non-fullment would create. Determining whether or not a technical regulation poses an unnecessary obsta- cle to international trade involves two steps. Firstly, the regulation must be designed to meet one of the legitimate objectives delineated in the TBT Agreement (see section 2.3). Secondly, the regulation must be the least trade-restrictive option available to a WTO Member that achieves that legitimate objec-tive, taking into account the risks that would be associated with its non-fullment. The TBT Agreement encourages WTO Members to develop technical regu- lations and standards that are based on product performance requirements,rather than on design requirements. The former creates fewer obstacles to trade,providing exporters greater leeway in terms of fullling the objectives of thetechnical requirements. For instance, it would be preferable for a country to stip-ulate the minimum amount of a micronutrient that must be present in a spe-cic type of food rather than a specic process for the addition of thatmicronutrient. Tohelp avoid unnecessary obstacles to international trade, the TBT Agree- ment requires WTO Members to revoke technical regulations when the objec- tives that had given rise to their adoption no longer exist, or if changed circumstances or objectives can be addressed in a less trade-restrictive manner. WTO Members must also ensure that unnecessary obstacles to international trade are avoided when preparing, adopting and applying conformity assess-ment procedures for technical regulations and standards. The TBT Agreementstates that, \"Conformity assessment procedures shall not be more strict or beGUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 326applied more strictly than is necessary to give the importing Member adequate condence that products conform with the applicable technical regulations orstandards, taking account of the risks that non-conformity would create.\" In other words, conformity assessment procedures must not be applied more strin-gently than is necessary to ensure conformity. They must consider the risks ofreduced stringency, and decide whether or not the risks outweigh the benetsof having fewer obstacles to international trade. The TBT Agreement also urges Members to ensure that conformity assess- ment procedures are undertaken as expeditiously as possible, that informationrequirements are limited to whatever is necessary, that the condentiality ofinformation is respected for legitimate commercial interests, and nally that thefees charged domestically are equitable to the fees charged for foreign products. 2.4.3 Harmonization The TBT Agreement encourages WTO Members to base their technical regu-lations, standards and conformity assessment procedures on international stan-dards, guidelines and recommendations, when these exist or their completion isimminent, excepting when they are deemed to be inappropriate or ineffective.For example, it allows derogation from technical regulations and standards in the event of climatic or geographic differences, or because of fundamental tech-nological problems. Although not specically refered to in the TBT Agreement,the Codex Alimentarius is widely interpreted as being the relevant text or \"goldstandard\" with respect to the development of regulations on food products. The call for harmonization is intended to avoid undue layers of technical requirements and assessment procedures, and to encourage the wider applica-tion of those that have already been developed and approved by the interna-tional community. T o support this endeavour, the TBT Agreement calls uponWTO Members to participate in the work of international standardizing andconformity assessment bodies. 2.4.4 Equivalence and mutual recognition International harmonization is a time-consuming process, and is sometimes dif-cult to achieve. The principle of equivalency is thus designed to complementthat of harmonization and the TBT Agreement encourages WTO Members toaccept each other's regulations as equivalent until international harmonizationbecomes possible. More specically, the TBT Agreement stipulates that WTOMembers give positive consideration to recognizing other Members' technicalregulations as being equivalent to their own, even when they differ, providedthat they are satised that the regulations adequately full their objective.Through the establishment of equivalency arrangements between countries,products that meet the regulations of the exporting country do not have toF.THE CODEX ALIMENTARIUS AND THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AGREEMENTS 327comply with the regulations of the importing country, so long as the same objec- tives are fullled by the two sets of requirements. This signicantly reduces bar-riers to trade. The TBT Agreement also calls upon WTO Members to ensure, whenever possible, that the results of conformity assessment procedures of other MemberCountries are accepted, even when they differ from their own, provided that theprocedures give the same level of condence. The purpose of this provision isto avoid multiple product testing (in both exporting and importing countrymarkets), and its associated costs. However, it is acknowledged that in order toachieve acceptance, negotiations may be needed, primarily to ensure the con-tinued reliability of conformity assessment results (the accreditation of con-formity assessment bodies is a factor that can be taken into account in thisregard). The TBT Agreement encourages these kinds of mutual recognitionagreements between WTO Members. 2.4.5 Transparency Transparency is a central feature of the TBT Agreement, and is achieved through notication obligations, the establishment of enquiry points, and thecreation of the WTO TBT Committee. Notication obligations require WTO Members to notify their draft techni- cal regulations, standards and conformity assessment procedures and also toallow other Members sufcient time to comment on them. Members are obligedto take comments from other countries into account. 1Notications provide a useful means of disseminating information, and can often help to avoid unnec-essary obstacles to international trade at an early stage. The advantage of thenotication system is that it provides exporters with the opportunity to learn ofnew requirements prior to their entry into force, to comment on these require-ments (and know that their comments will be taken into account), and to preparethemselves for compliance. The TBT Agreement stipulates that each WTO Member establish an enquiry point for responding to questions on technical regulations, standards and con-formity assessment procedures (whether proposed or adopted), and for sup-plying relevant documents. A TBT Committee has been established as part of the TBT Agreement to act as a forum for consultation and negotiation on all issues pertaining to theAgreement. Participation in the Committee is open to all WTO Members, anda number of international standardizing bodies are invited to attend meetings asobservers.GUIDELINES ON FOOD FORTIFICATION WITH MICRONUTRIENTS 3281Draft technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures only have to be notied when an international standard, guide or recommendation, does not exist (or they are not in accordancewith existing ones), and if they may a have a signicant effect on the trade of other WTOMembers.References 1.

One of the main reasons is the realization that micronutrient malnutrition contributes substantially to the global burd en of disease. Furthermore, although micronutrient malnutrition is more frequent and severe in the developing world and among disadvantaged populations, it also repres ents a public health problem in some industrialized countrie s. Measures to correct mi cronutrient deciencies aim at ensuring consumption of a balanced diet that is adequate in every nu trient. Unfortunately, th is is far from being achieved everywhere since it requires universal access to adequate food and appropriate dietary habits. Food fortication has the dual advantage of being able to deliver nutrients to large segments of the population withou t requir ing radical changes in food consumption patterns. Draw ing on several recent hig h quality publications and programme experience on the subject, information on food fortication has been critically analysed and then translated into scientically sound guidelines for application in the eld. Th e main purpose of these guidelines is to assist countries in the design and implementation of appropriate food fortica tion programmes. They are intended to be a resource for govern ments an d agencies that are currently implementing or considering food forti cation, an d a source of information for scientists, technologists and the food i ndustry. The guidelin es are wr itten from a nutrition and public health perspective, to provide practical guidance on how food fortication should be implemented, monitored and evaluated. They are primar ily intended for nutritio n-related public health programme managers, but should also be useful to all those work ing to control micronutrient malnutrition, including the food industry. The document is organized into four complementary sections. Part I introduces the concep t of food fortication as a potential strategy for the control of micronutrient malnutrition. Part II su mmarizes the preva lence, caus es, and consequences of micronutrient ies, and the public health benets of micron utrient malnutrition control. It lays the groundwork for public health personnel to asse ss the magnitude of the proble m and the potential benets of fortica tion in their particular situation. Part III provides technical information on the various chemical forms of micron utrients that can be used t o f ortify foods, and reviews prior experiences of their use in specic food vehicles. Part IV describes th e key steps involved in design ing, implementing, and sustaining fortication programmes. Starting with a determination of the amount of nutrients to be added to foods, this process continues with the implementation of monitoring and evaluating system s (including quality control/quality assurance procedures), followed by an estimation of cost-effectiveness and cost-benet ratios. The importance of, and strategies for, regulation and international harmonization , communication, advocacy , cons umer marketing and public education are also explained in some detail.
