At [vaccinate.virginia.gov](https://vaccinate.virginia.gov/), you can access the \"Search by Location\" feature which allows you to enter the street address where you usually live. You will then be provided options for making an appointment. Many clinics offer walk-in vaccination service in addition to scheduled appointments. The website includes a simple address search to help you find the most convenient ways and places to get vaccinated. The call center is available Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET. There are Spanish and English-speaking agents, as well as additional language services in over 100 languages to assist those residents and workers who speak other languages. For individuals with access and functional needs, you can reach the call center via Virginia Relay, including by TTY, by dialing 7-1-1. ASL users have two ways to connect: by videophone at 1-877-VAX-IN-VA (1-877-829-4682) or by clicking the \"ASL Now\" button at [vaccinate.virginia.gov](http://vaccinate.virginia.gov/). No, a government-issued photo identification is not required for COVID-19 vaccination. It is important however, to have some way to confirm your or your child's identity (i.e., name, date of birth) so we can confirm that we are vaccinating the right person. VDH maintains a [COVID-19 Vaccine Summary](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine-summary/) dashboard with demographic information (i.e., age, race and ethnicity) also available. The COVID-19 vaccine \"must be provided to vaccine recipients with no out-of-pocket costs,\" according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). While the federal government is picking up the cost of the vaccine doses people across the country are getting and will continue to do so after the May 11, 2023 end of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency, some healthcare providers and clinics can get paid for administering the vaccines. For those people with health insurance, this cost is typically billed to the insurance company. Even if you do not have health insurance, you can still get a COVID-19 vaccine for free. All COVID-19 vaccination sites in Virginia are ADA-compliant. If you need special accommodations when going to get your or your child's vaccination, please reach out to your local health department. To schedule an appointment for the COVID-19 vaccine visit [vaccinate.virginia.gov/](https://vaccinate.virginia.gov/) or call 1-877-VAX-IN VA (1-877-829-4682) Monday through Friday from 8:00 am - 5:00 pm ET.

Vaccination: Why Get Vaccinated Against COVID-19 It is difficult to predict what will happen with COVID-19 because there is always a risk of new kinds (variants or subvariants) of COVID-19 arising in the future. In addition, COVID-19 is likely to be around for a long time and there's no way to know ahead of time how getting COVID-19 disease could affect you as an individual. For example, we still don't know why a few healthy but unvaccinated people become seriously ill or die from COVID-19, while most other healthy people either become only mildly sick or even have no symptoms when infected (asymptomatic). In addition, people with mild or even asymptomatic disease can also develop and continue suffering from [Long COVID](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html). However, once vaccinated, your body will start building immunity to the virus so you are less likely to get infected, less likely to get seriously ill if you are infected, less likely to transmit COVID-19 to others, and less likely to get Long COVID. Staying [up to date](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) with your COVID-19 vaccines, will reduce your chances of getting COVID-19 disease and will make it more likely that even if you do get the virus, you will have only mild symptoms or none at all. Based on evidence from clinical trials, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective for preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death for everyone aged 6 months and older. Although the data from the most recent omicron XBB variants of COVID-19 is still uncertain, [both older](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00177-5) and more [recent studies ](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2352-4642%2822%2900100-6)suggest the risk of developing \"Long COVID\" is much lower in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people who get COVID-19. In addition, some people who already had Long COVID after an earlier infection noted an improvement of their symptoms after they received their COVID-19 vaccine. The potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccines on Long COVID are now being studied carefully and results will hopefully be available soon. More [information on ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects.html) [Long COVID](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/index.html) and other long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 illness can be found on the CDC website. Vaccination: Vaccine Development + Safety The updated COVID-19 vaccines are also called \"bivalent\" (meaning having two parts) because they are made from two different kinds of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. The safety of the bivalent Moderna and Pfizer vaccines was shown using data from human studies using a slightly older bivalent vaccine. Those vaccine side effects were similar to side effects seen with the original primary vaccine series doses. No new safety concerns were identified. The effectiveness of the updated bivalent Moderna and Pfizer vaccines now has been documented in several recent studies, including [one that indicated that the vaccine](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00122-6/fulltext) containing the BA.4 and BA.5 particles against COVID-19 omicron infection were effective for up to 120 days in preventing hospitalization for COVID-19 illness. mRNA stands for messenger ribonucleic acid. The COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use mRNA to cause a two-stage immune response. First, the vaccines' mRNA teaches your cells to make a specific non-infectious COVID-19 protein. Then, this protein stimulates your immune system to respond against COVID-19. That immune response produces antibodies and other forms of immunity that help keep you from becoming infected if you are later exposed to COVID-19. The mRNA in the COVID-19 vaccines does NOT get into the nucleus of your cells or put germs into your body. These two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines will not change your DNA or your body's other genetic material in any way. These mRNA COVID-19 vaccines do not inject spike proteins into your body. Additional information about [the development of mRNA vaccines](https://www.uab.edu/news/youcanuse/item/12059-covid-19-mrna-vaccines-how-could-anything-developed-this-quickly-be-safe) is available. The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is a non-mRNA vaccine that contains an \"adjuvant\" which is a chemical that amplifies the immune system's response to the vaccine. Adjuvants have been in use for many years in a number of U.S. vaccines such as hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and TDaP (tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis / whooping cough). This Novavax vaccine uses a more traditional approach, by injecting the spike proteins of the coronavirus, stimulating the immune system to respond directly to those proteins. Its primary vaccination series includes two doses intended to be given from 3-8 weeks apart to people 12 years and older. Novavax study data indicated an overall 90% effectiveness in preventing infection with pre-Omicron variants of SARS-CoV-2 (including 79% effectiveness in people 65 years and older) and near 100% overall effectiveness in preventing moderate-to-severe COVID-19 disease, hospitalization, and death. [Information on the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html) is available on the CDC website.

Information on the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine can be found [on the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/Novavax.html). A complete list of this vaccine's ingredients can be found in the Novavax [fact sheet](https://www.fda.gov/media/159898/download). Type of vaccine: protein vaccine with adjuvant (also known as \"adjuvanted protein\" vaccine) The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine does not contain: eggs, preservatives, gelatin, or latex. How given: injection in the muscle of the upper arm The Novavax COVID-19 vaccine may be used for people 12 years and older. Yes. In general, COVID-19 vaccines and other approved vaccines may be administered to all age groups without regard to timing. This includes getting a COVID-19 vaccine and other vaccines on the same day, as well as co-administration within 14 days. This includes the flu, pneumococcal, tetanus, and shingles vaccine. However, there are additional considerations if also receiving an orthopoxvirus (mpox) vaccine: - People who previously received a dose of any COVID-19 vaccine may be given Mpox (orthopoxvirus) vaccine without a minimum interval between vaccinations. - People who previously received Mpox (orthopoxvirus) vaccination , particularly adolescent or young adult males, might consider waiting 4 weeks before receiving a dose of any COVID-19 vaccine because of the observed risk for myocarditis and pericarditis after receipt of ACAM2000 orthopoxvirus vaccine and COVID-19 vaccines, and the unknown risk for myocarditis and pericarditis after JYNNEOS administration. [https://www.janssenlabels.com/emergency-use-authorization/Janssen+COVID-19+Vaccine-Recipient-fact-sheet.pdf](https://www.janssenlabels.com/emergency-use-authorization/Janssen+COVID-19+Vaccine-Recipient-fact-sheet.pdf) Yes. Getting COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy can protect you and your fetus and infant from getting severe illness from COVID-19. Currently and recently pregnant people are more likely than non-pregnant people to get severely ill if they get COVID-19. Pregnant women with some underlying health conditions, such as diabetes or obesity, are at even greater risk. Having COVID-19 disease while pregnant has been associated with stillbirths, preterm birth, low birth weight babies, and other adverse outcomes of pregnancy. In addition, another [study](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7107e3.htm?s_cid=mm7107e3_w) showed that infants whose mothers received two doses of COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy were 61% less likely to be hospitalized in their first six months of life compared to infants of unvaccinated mothers. The CDC, VDH, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (SMFM) all recommend that pregnant or breast-feeding women or other women who intend to get pregnant and who otherwise are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination should be COVID-19 vaccinated and then stay up to date with vaccination. The [ACOG recommendations](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care) are available and a [ joint message about COVID-19 vaccination](https://www.acog.org/news/news-releases/2021/07/acog-smfm-recommend-covid-19-vaccination-for-pregnant-individuals) from ACOG and SMFM is also available. CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have several vaccine safety monitoring systems in place to collect and study information about vaccination during pregnancy and continue to closely monitor that information. The safety monitoring of COVID-19 vaccines [has been described](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1473-3099%2822%2900123-2) as \"the most comprehensive of any vaccine in US history.\" CDC and FDA continuously monitor the safety of vaccines. These agencies use several different systems to monitor vaccine safety: [The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)](https://vaers.hhs.gov/): VAERS is an early warning system that helps CDC and FDA identify potential problems following vaccination. Anyone can and should report possible vaccine side effects to VAERS. However, most of the VAERS monitoring is done by U.S. healthcare providers providing anonymous data from hundreds of millions of patients being vaccinated. This system alerts the CDC and FDA if healthcare systems begin reporting unusual patterns of adverse effect information about events that occur after vaccinations. NOTE: every healthcare provider who administers COVID-19 vaccines is required to report all serious health events occurring soon after vaccination to the VAERS system even if it seems clear that the death was not related to the vaccine. VAERS is therefore set up as an early warning system to collect as much data as possible about any and all events that may or may not turn out to be side effects of vaccines. Those data are then examined closely to verify the events and to identify any clusters or groups of unexpected serious or severe post-vaccine events. Because the data submitted to - and made publicly available by - VAERS has not yet been verified, the VAERS system clearly cannot determine whether a vaccine caused any specific side effect. VAERS is NOT - and is NOT INTENDED TO BE - a reliable source of information on vaccine side effects. Therefore, drawing conclusions from these publicly available but unverified VAERS screening data alone without the follow-up investigations is scientifically and ethically inappropriate because it is likely to lead to erroneous conclusions. A description of [how VAERS works](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4632204/pdf/nihms-732970.pdf) is available. [The Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/vsd/index.html): a collaboration between CDC and nine health care organizations around the United States, which allows ongoing monitoring and proactive searches of vaccine-related data. [The Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/cisa/index.html): a partnership between CDC and several medical centers that conducts clinical research on vaccine-associated health risks. Additional vaccine safety monitoring systems, such as [the use of ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html) [National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html) [data](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html), and continued monitoring through clinical trials are also utilized to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination: Side Effects and Adverse Events After COVID-19 Vaccine NOTE - The current updated COVID-19 vaccines are called \"bivalent\" (meaning having two parts) because they are made from two different kinds of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Short term vaccine side effects fall into one of three categories: (1) Local reactions, at or near the injection site (2) Systemic reactions (such as fever, chills, headache, or muscle aches) (3) Allergic reactions This FAQ response addresses the local and systemic side effects that may occur in people of all ages. Allergic side effects are addressed in a later question (FAQ) and response. Although COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you from getting COVID-19 disease, you may have some short term local or systemic side effects from the vaccination, which are normal signs that your body is building protection against COVID-19. Some vaccinated adults and children have had local reactions such as pain, redness, or tenderness at the injection site. A small number of vaccine recipients have had systemic side effects such as fatigue, nausea, chills, fever, headache or other body aches that may last for a few days. These local or systemic side effects do NOT mean that the vaccine has given you a COVID-19 infection. Rather, these expected side effects mean that the vaccine is causing your body's immune system to react and create antibodies to fight off the virus that causes COVID-19 if you are exposed in the future. Some vaccine recipients have experienced swollen glands (lymph nodes). For the two mRNA vaccines, these expected side effects are more common in younger people than older people and are more common after the second dose than after the first dose. Less commonly, a few people have reported redness, swelling, and itching around the injection site beginning a few days or in the second week after their first vaccine dose. These local reactions are not considered to be allergic reactions and are not a risk for anaphylaxis when getting a second dose. Individuals with delayed injection site reactions after the first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose should get the second dose using the same vaccine product as the first dose and at the recommended interval, and preferably in the opposite arm. More [information](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html) is available about these uncommon \"COVID arm\" reactions. As with any vaccine, such as the flu vaccine, fainting soon after injection has also been noted among a small number of COVID-19 vaccine recipients, especially adolescents and young adults. This kind of short term reaction is not a reason to avoid future recommended doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Finally, even if you or your child experience one or more of these expected short term side effects after a dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, it is very important that you still stay up to date by receiving all future recommended doses. Some of the expected short term side effects could interfere with your - or your child's - ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Age appropriate over-the-counter (OTC) medicines such as acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help with the common side effects (for example, arm pain or fever) after those side effects start to occur. However, these drugs should not be taken before your COVID-19 vaccine doses since information on their possible impact on the body's immune response to COVID-19 infection is not yet available. If you or your child have persistent injection site pain, fever, or other discomfort, talk to your healthcare provider about taking one of these OTC medicines. To reduce pain and discomfort where you or your child got the shot: - Apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area. - Use or exercise the arm as much as possible after receiving the shot to help prevent worsening pain and discomfort. - Also, if possible, get some rest. - Talk to your doctor about OTC medicines. To reduce discomfort from fever: - Dress in comfortable clothing. - Drink plenty of fluids. - Talk to your doctor about OTC medicines. When to call the doctor: In most cases, common side effects (like pain or discomfort at the injection site, fever, headache, fatigue, etc.) will not last more than a few days after a COVID-19 vaccine dose. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider if: - Redness or tenderness where you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours - Side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days Side effects or adverse events can be reported to CDC in [VAERS](https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html). Information on possible vaccine adverse events (side effects) continues to be collected and studied by CDC, FDA, and other groups, using multiple systems to collect the data. To date, very few blood clotting problems in people who received an mRNA COVID-19 vaccination (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech) have been reported to VAERS. Based on currently available data, there is not an increased risk of this kind of problem after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination. There have been rare reports of myocarditis or pericarditis among people ages 30 and younger who received a COVID-19 vaccine. Most patients responded well to rest and quickly recovered. More information on this topic can be found on CDC's [Myocarditis and Pericarditis After mRNA COVID-19 Vaccination ](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html)webpage. CDC and FDA continues to monitor reports of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), a rare disorder involving nerve damage that can occur in anyone receiving a vaccine. Most people fully recover from GBS, but some have permanent nerve damage. These cases have largely been reported about 2 weeks after vaccination and mostly in men, many 50 years and older. Recent CDC studies have found evidence suggesting an increased risk of GBS among adults 18 years and older after J&J/Janssen COVID-19 vaccination, but not after Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccination. Given the ongoing risk of serious complications, hospitalization, and even death (including deaths of children) from COVID-19 illness, and given the rarity of serious adverse effects, CDC and VDH continue to strongly recommend being [up to date](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) with COVID-19 vaccinations, including with the most recently updated COVID-19 vaccine. Given the ongoing risk of serious complications, hospitalization, and even death (including deaths of children) from COVID-19 illness, and given the rarity of serious adverse effects, CDC and VDH continue to strongly recommend being with COVID-19 vaccinations, including with the most recently updated COVID-19 vaccine. An updated set of descriptions and recommendations for use of COVID-19 vaccines, including their side effects, can be found [on the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html). NOTE: As of May 6, 2023, the Janssen (Johnson & Johnson or J&J) COVID-19 vaccine is no longer available in the United States. One serious but rare adverse effect that was identified with that vaccine was a blood clotting problem that occurred in a very small number of vaccinated people. For additional information about rare, but serious side effects, visit the CDC page at [Selected Adverse Events Reported after COVID-19 Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html). No. Effects on reproduction have NOT been seen and are unlikely to occur after COVID-19 vaccination. There is no genetic material in any of the current COVID-19 vaccines so there is no risk of a COVID-19 vaccine changing the DNA of any vaccine recipient or that person's children. Studies have been published about temporary post-vaccination changes in women's menstrual cycles. However, short-term changes in menstrual cycles can be associated with stress, infection, weight changes, dietary changes (including a diet high in soy), excess exercise, or sleep problems. Studies do not suggest any impact on fertility and, not surprisingly, similar reports about changes in duration and flow of menstrual cycles have been noted after COVID-19 illness. Additionally, people using hormonal birth control (pills, patch, ring, implant, etc.) can receive any of the current COVID-19 vaccines. One recent study found no increase in the risk of miscarriages in the pregnancies of fully vaccinated women. As noted elsewhere, there is no reason to withhold COVID 19 vaccine from women who are intending to get pregnant, are currently pregnant, are post-partum, and/or are breastfeeding. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine prior to or during pregnancy can protect you, your fetus, and your infant from severe COVID-19 illness. In summary, no negative fertility effects have been found for any current U.S. COVID-19 vaccine and there is no biologic reason to suspect that COVID-19 vaccines might have an effect on female or male fertility. More information is available at the following sources: - A review of the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in terms of fertility and sexual function was published in the [Scientific American magazine](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/covid-vaccines-show-no-signs-of-harming-fertility-or-sexual-function/). - A review of the vaccine-menstrual cycle study data [A summary of the overall vaccine-menstrual cycle study data questions](https://www.henryford.com/blog/2022/02/covid-vaccines-and-menstrual-cycle) - CDC's [COVID-19 Vaccines While Pregnant or Breastfeeding](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html)webpage Vaccination: Staying Up to Date with COVID-19 Vaccinations Everyone aged 6 years and older should get at least one dose of bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine to be considered up to date. People aged 65 years and older may get a 2nd bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 dose. People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised may also get additional bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine doses. Children aged 6 months-5 years may need multiple doses of COVID-19 vaccine to be up to date, including at least 1 updated dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, depending on their age and the number of doses they've previously received. There is no maximum amount of time between doses for any of these vaccines, thus there is no need to restart the vaccine series if you past the recommended timeframe. However, do not get following doses earlier than the recommended date. An 8-week interval between the first and second doses of bivalent Moderna, monovalent Novavax, and bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines might be better for some people as it might reduce the small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with these COVID-19 vaccines. Under the current COVID-19 vaccination schedule, the extended interval applies only to children ages 6 months-5 years, depending on their vaccination history and which mRNA vaccine is administered, and people ages 12 years and older receiving Novavax vaccine. While absolute risk remains small, an elevated risk for myocarditis and pericarditis has been observed among mRNA COVID-19 vaccine recipients, particularly in males ages 12-39 years. If you or your child are immunocompromised, talk with your healthcare or vaccine provider about the COVID-19 vaccine timing that is right for you or your child. Detailed information on COVID-19 vaccination recommendations is available on [the CDC COVID-19 vaccination website.](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html?s_cid=11369:cdc%20children%20covid%20vaccine:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21) Yes. Although people up to date with COVID-19 vaccination who get breakthrough infections can sometimes spread COVID-19 to others, such people seem to be contagious for a shorter time than infected but unvaccinated people. This [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00632-3) [ magazine article discusses](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00632-3) the disease transmission benefits of a monovalent vaccine booster dose. After being boosted, \"[people] who had received a single booster were 38% less likely to spread a Delta variant infection to their household members, and 22% less likely to pass on an Omicron variant infection than were those who had had just two doses.\" Although equivalent transmission prevention data from the updated vaccine are not yet available, the protection from that vaccine is expected to be similar. For airline travel to other countries, COVID-19 viral testing may sometimes be required for pre-travel screening on international airline flights. Some countries may still be requiring proof of vaccination before allowing travelers to enter certain facilities (for example, restaurants). Before ANY travel to other countries, you should check closely with both your airline and with the national COVID-19 testing and COVID-19 vaccination requirements of the country or countries that you will be visiting. For airline travel from other countries to the United States, CDC no longer requires any arriving passengers, including U.S. citizens. to show any proof of a negative COVID-19 viral PCR or antigen test. For cruise ship travel, CDC [recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/cruise-travel-during-covid19.html) that you make sure you are [up to date](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) with your COVID-19 vaccines before travel. For additional information, please visit the VDH's [Travelers](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/get-the-latest-guidance/travel/#international-travel) FAQs or the [ CDC International Travelers' web page](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel/index.html). No. Serology (antibody) testing to confirm immunity after vaccination is not currently recommended by CDC or by VDH. One important reason is that some of the currently marketed serology test kits use a different technology than others and may not be able to detect the spike protein antibodies that are the most important antibodies produced by the mRNA COVID-19 vaccination process. Using these test kits could provide a false negative test result that would not reflect your actual protection provided by the COVID-19 vaccine. NOTE: This recommendation against routine COVID-19 serology (antibody) testing also applies to any immunocompromised people having a serology test after their COVID-19 vaccination series. An additional dose is an extra COVID-19 vaccine dose administered to someone with a [moderately or severely weakened immune system](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/immuno.html) because their initial immune response after completing the primary vaccine series may have been insufficient to provide them with strong protection. - An initial 3-dose primary series is recommended for people aged 5 years and older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised at the time of vaccination. The same bivalent mRNA vaccine product should be used for all three doses of the primary series. The 3rd primary (additional) dose is administered at least 4 weeks after the 2nd dose. - For moderately or severely immunocompromised people aged18 years and older who received the one-dose primary Janssen vaccination, an additional dose using a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is recommended at least 4 weeks later. Those people who receive an additional dose because they are immunocompromised will also be eligible for additional recommended vaccine doses (when they also meet the age and time requirements. As of the review date noted above, the currently recommended vaccine for additional doses is the updated (bivalent) Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine booster. See the CDC [COVID-19 Vaccination Schedule](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/images/COVID19-vaccination-schedule-most-people.png) or [COVID-19 Vaccine Schedule (Immunocompromised). ](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/images/COVID19-vaccination-schedule-immunocompromised.png) Information on accessing a COVID-19 primary series or booster dose can be found at [vaccinate.virginia.gov](https://vaccinate.virginia.gov/). No. Although a driver's license or other sort of valid identification card will be required to establish your identity, proof of prior vaccination is not required. However, bringing your CDC vaccination card to the vaccination site will allow doses to be added to your card. Vaccination: Natural Immunity To maximize protection from future COVID-19 infections and reinfections, you should always stay [up to date](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) with COVID-19 vaccinations. For COVID-19, hybrid immunity is a combination of (1) the immunity from being up to date with COVID-19 vaccination plus (2) the immunity from having a natural COVID-19 illness. The hybrid immunity coming from this combination of natural infection and COVID-19 vaccination provides a higher, stronger, and more consistent level of protection from COVID-19 than either infection alone or vaccination alone. Several studies have found that people who had that combination of hybrid immunity from both COVID-19 infection AND COVID-19 vaccination had even lower disease risks than people who had immunity from only COVID-19 disease or from only COVID-19 vaccination. Recent studies that include hybrid immunity data on Omicron variants are [available](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1473-3099%2822%2900640-5). If you were previously sick with COVID-19 and are due for a COVID-19 vaccine, CDC recommends that you may consider waiting up to three (3) months from symptom onset (or after a positive COVID-19 test if you didn't have symptoms). This waiting period is based on data indicating that high levels of anti-COVID-19 antibody and protection persist at least until that point. More information is available on [CDC's website](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/faq.html#infection). Vaccination: Healthcare Providers Providers are required by CDC to report vaccine administration information in a timely manner. Additionally, VDH requires all vaccine administrations, including COVID-19, to be reported to the [Virginia Immunization Information System](https://viis.vdh.virginia.gov/VIIS/portalInfoManager.do) (VIIS). These reports are very important for ensuring that there is an established reporting and data feedback loop for the COVID-19 vaccine. Yes. Healthcare providers who are interested in providing the COVID-19 vaccine may complete a Provider Intent form on the [Virginia Electronic Registration for Immunization Programs (VERIP) website](https://apps.vdh.virginia.gov/VERIP/Home.aspx). VDH staff will contact providers once they have submitted their intent form to discuss the next steps to enroll as a COVID-19 vaccine provider. Further [information](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/covid-19-vaccine/healthcare-professionals/#penroll) specific to enrollment as a vaccine provider in Virginia and [general information](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccination-provider-support.html) from CDC are available. CDC has self-study web modules for healthcare providers that can be found at [Vaccine Courses, Broadcasts, Webcasts and Self Study Training ](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/ed/courses.html)and include a general overview of COVID-19 Immunization Best Practices (15 minutes) and a set of modules on what healthcare providers need to know about each of the current COVID-19 vaccines. Each of these courses includes continuing medical education (CME) credits. Additional resources include the CDC website \" [Clinical Care Considerations for COVID-19 Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/index.html),\" the CDC \" [COVID-19 Vaccination](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/index.html)\" homepage for healthcare professionals, and [COVID-19 Vaccine Product Information](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/hcp/faq.html).The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists provides [COVID-19 Vaccination Considerations for Obstetric-Gynecologic Care](https://www.acog.org/clinical/clinical-guidance/practice-advisory/articles/2020/12/covid-19-vaccination-considerations-for-obstetric-gynecologic-care). The American Academy of Pediatrics provides [COVID-19 Vaccine Resources](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/covid-19-vaccine-for-children/?_ga=2.55636201.373111073.1656079298-1206140441.1656079298) and [COVID-19 Frequently Asked Questions](https://www.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-infections/covid-19-vaccine-for-children/about-the-covid-19-vaccine-frequently-asked-questions/) related to children. U.S. healthcare providers or health departments can request a consultation from CDC's Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) COVIDvax project for any complex COVID-19 vaccine safety question that is (1) about an individual patient residing in the U.S. or vaccine safety issue and (2) not readily addressed by CDC or [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/recommendations.html) guidelines. This request can be made through CDC-INFO by: - Calling 800-CDC-INFO (800-232-4636), or - Submitting a request via [CDC-INFO webform](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/dcs/ContactUs/Form) For more information, visit the CDC's [Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment (CISA) Project](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ensuringsafety/monitoring/cisa/index.html) webpage. CDC provides [information](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/interim-considerations-us.html#adverse-events) on how to address vaccine administration errors. Additional resources can be found on [CDC's vaccine administration web page](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/admin-protocols.html). Key points include: - Inform the recipient of the vaccine administration error. - Consult with the state immunization program and/or Immunization Information System (IIS) to determine how the dose should be entered into the IIS. The [Virginia IIS homepage](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/immunization/viis/)is available. - Report the error to the [Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System](https://vaers.hhs.gov/)(VAERS). - Determine how the error occurred and implement strategies to prevent it from happening again. Adverse events that occur in a recipient following COVID-19 vaccination should be reported to VAERS. Vaccination providers are required by FDA and the provider agreement for the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program to report the following that occur after COVID-19 vaccination under BLA or EUA: - Vaccine administration errors whether or not associated with an adverse event [Serious adverse events](https://vaers.hhs.gov/faq.html), irrespective of attribution to vaccination - Cases of Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS) in adults and children - Cases of myocarditis - Cases of pericarditis - Cases of COVID-19 that result in hospitalization or death Reporting is encouraged for any other clinically significant adverse event, even if it is uncertain whether the vaccine caused the event. Information on how to submit a report to VAERS is available at [https://vaers.hhs.gov](https://vaers.hhs.gov/) or by calling 1-800-822-7967. No. Individuals can self-attest, or self-report, that they are eligible for an additional bivalent dose of an mRNA vaccine (with moderate or severe immunocompromising condition). Eligible persons should be able to receive this additional bivalent dose wherever vaccines are offered in Virginia. Vaccine providers should ask patients questions to confirm eligibility for vaccination, including the person's age and previous COVID-19 vaccination history. Vaccination: Long-Term Care Facilities LTCFs are recommended to use their regular facility-pharmacy operations to acquire the COVID-19 vaccine for their residents and/or staff. LTCFs should maintain open and constant communication with their contracted pharmacy providers to discuss meeting COVID-19 vaccine needs moving forward. If your LTCF does not have a contracted pharmacy partner, see FAQs below for how to access vaccine. The VDH Pharmacy Team is working to improve access to COVID-19 vaccines in LTC settings. Facilities that order and offer vaccination by other means should utilize their standard channels. Facilities that otherwise do not have access to COVID-19 vaccines and require assistance with obtaining vaccine may reach out to [COVIDPharmacySupport@vdh.virginia.gov](mailto:COVIDPharmacySupport@vdh.virginia.gov). The Federal pharmacy partnership program will not be reinstated by CDC for COVID-19 vaccine assistance. However, CDC has partnered with various pharmacies to ensure LTCFs are able to access the COVID-19 vaccine. For more information, visit the CDC [pharmacy partner contact information page](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/retail-pharmacy-program/pharmacies-contact.html). If you require further assistance in coordinating vaccines for your facility, please contact your local health district or email [COVIDPharmacySupport@vdh.virginia.gov](mailto:COVIDPharmacySupport@vdh.virginia.gov). - Facilities are encouraged to enroll as a vaccine provider to be able to order and administer vaccines to staff and residents themselves. This will allow facilities to vaccinate residents and staff in a more timely manner. For more information, visit the [VDH Provider Enrollment Process Flow & Checklist](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/191/2021/01/Provider-Enrollment-Flow-Checklist-1.pdf). - If enrolling as a vaccine provider is not an option, you can consider identifying a local pharmacy to contract with. - LTCFs may also submit an off-site clinic request with pharmacies who may be able to assist facilities with their vaccination needs. For more information, visit the CDC [pharmacy partner contact information page](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/retail-pharmacy-program/pharmacies-contact.html). If you require further assistance in coordinating COVID-19 vaccines for your facility, please contact your local health district or email [COVIDPharmacySupport@vdh.virginia.gov](mailto:COVIDPharmacySupport@vdh.virginia.gov). LTCFs are able to order and administer vaccines through VaxMaX if the facility is enrolled as a vaccine provider. For more information on how to enroll as a vaccine provider, visit the [VDH Provider Enrollment Process Flow & Checklist](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/content/uploads/sites/191/2021/01/Provider-Enrollment-Flow-Checklist-1.pdf). [Patient education](https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/covid-19-vaccine/patient-education/) about the COVID-19 vaccine can be found on the VDH website. These resources can be used to help educate LTCF residents and staff who remain vaccine hesitant. There are multiple factors to be considered before deciding whether to conduct a vaccine clinic during an active COVID-19 outbreak. - Individuals with active COVID-19 infection are not recommended to receive a vaccination. - If the outbreak is under control and is restricted to one unit/area of the facility, the clinic can be conducted by following the recommendations from [CDC infection prevention guidance](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control-recommendations.html)(under \"indoor visitation during an outbreak response\"). - If the facility's current outbreak response plan includes expanding routine COVID-19 testing, it is prudent to reschedule the vaccine clinic to a later date. - The facility should notify the clinic provider about the outbreak situation to discuss next steps. As of 10/26/2022, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released an [update](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qs0-23-02-all.pdf) regarding the COVID-19 vaccination definition and how LTC facilities should respond to infection control. As outlined in \u00a7483.80(i) COVID-19 Vaccination of facility staff. The facility must develop and implement policies and procedures to ensure that all staff are fully vaccinated for COVID-19. For purposes of this section, staff are considered fully vaccinated if it has been 2 weeks or more since they completed a primary vaccination series for COVID-19. The completion of a primary vaccination series for COVID-19 is defined here as the administration of a single-dose vaccine, or the administration of all required doses of a multi-dose vaccine. The surveyors utilize a set of detailed guidelines outlined by CMS to complete the surveys. These guidelines have not changed and are used at each survey. Vaccination: Children Yes. Minors (those less than 18 years old) in the Commonwealth of Virginia may not consent to their own immunizations to prevent disease. There are some exceptions to this restriction. For example, any minor who is or has been married is considered to be an adult for the purpose of giving consent to their own surgical and medical treatment. The Commonwealth allows someone acting \"in loco parentis\" per: [\u00a7 32.1-46](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/32.1-46/), which covers vaccination in accordance with the Immunization schedule developed by and published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). In an effort to maintain consistency with similar approaches to vaccination, a minor may present for COVID-19 vaccination with either a parent, guardian, or someone standing in loco parentis. Vaccination sites run by the Virginia Department of Health require the parent or guardian to verbally confirm a minor's date of birth; however, other providers may require additional proof of age. You should check with the facility that is offering the vaccination about requirements for proof of age. The most commonly reported local side effect is pain or tenderness at the injection site. The most commonly reported systemic side effect is fatigue for older children and irritability and drowsiness for younger children. Side effects are usually mild in severity and resolve within a few days. Fever after vaccination may also occur in some children. The pattern of side effects seen with the updated mRNA COVID-19 vaccines is similar to what was seen with the earlier vaccines. First, parents should be aware that myocarditis and other heart problems are much more common and more severe after COVID-19 illness than after COVID-19 vaccination. According to a [CDC MMWR](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7114e1.htm), young men (particularly between 18-29 years old) had 7-8 times the risk of heart complications after SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 infection compared to after COVID-19 vaccination. Myocarditis is inflammation (irritation) of the heart muscle, and pericarditis is inflammation of the outer lining of the heart. In both cases, the body's immune system causes inflammation in response to an infection or some other trigger. Cases of myocarditis and pericarditis in adolescents and young adults have been reported more often after getting the second dose than after the first dose of one of the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, Pfizer or Moderna. These reports are rare and the known and potential benefits of COVID-19 vaccination outweigh the known and potential risks, including the [possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html). An 8-week interval between the first and doses of bivalent Moderna, monovalent Novavax, and bivalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines might be better for some people as it might reduce the small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with these COVID-19 vaccines. Under the current COVID-19 vaccination schedule, the extended interval applies only to children ages 6 months-5 years, depending on their vaccination history and which mRNA vaccine is administered, and people ages 12 years and older receiving Novavax vaccine. While absolute risk remains small, an elevated risk for myocarditis and pericarditis has been observed among mRNA COVID-19 vaccine recipients, particularly in males ages 12-39 years. Talk to your child's healthcare or vaccine provider about the timing of their next shot. Learn more about [myocarditis and pericarditis](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/heart-inflammation) [. ](https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/heart-inflammation)Seek medical care if you or your child have symptoms of these conditions after COVID-19 illness or after COVID-19 vaccination. Both updated COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Parents of eligible children can choose to get either vaccine. The CDC and VDH do not recommend one over the other. Parents and caregivers should get their child vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine that is available to them and that they feel comfortable with. Certain locations may only carry one brand of vaccine. No. Although children 6 months and older are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination, there are no plans to mandate that K-12 school children in Virginia receive a COVID-19 vaccine at this time. Although the rates of serious problems with COVID-19 are lower in children than in adults, children who have COVID-19 are still at risk of becoming sick, hospitalized, or in some cases, dying. Children with other COVID-19 risk factors such as diabetes and obesity are more likely to experience severe COVID-19. Children may also develop long-term illness, such as [multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)](https://www.cdc.gov/mis/mis-c.html) or [Long COVID](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects/) . Among children 1-4 years of age in the United States, COVID-19 was the [5th most common](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2022-06-17-18/03-COVID-Oliver-508.pdf) cause of death in 2020-2022. One in four infants and young children hospitalized with COVID-19 require ICU admission. More than half of the hospitalized children in the United States with a COVID-19 infection aged 6 months-4 years old had no underlying conditions. CDC [data from April 2022](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7116e1.htm?s_cid=mm7116e1_w) shows that during the Omicron surge, hospitalization rates from COVID-19 in children aged 5-11 years were approximately twice as high among unvaccinated as among vaccinated children. Thirty percent of hospitalized children had no underlying medical conditions. The COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective at preventing severe illness and death.COVID-19 vaccination can help children stay in school or other childcare settings and can decrease the likelihood of spreading COVID-19 infection. Vaccination: People with Weakened Immune Systems Yes, a third primary series vaccine dose is recommended for certain moderately or severely immunocompromised people. However, even those people with weakened immune systems who receive an additional dose of an mRNA vaccine still might not have strong protection against COVID-19 after vaccination. These individuals should speak to their healthcare provider about planning for additional prevention measures. They should also have a [plan of action](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/needs-extra-precautions/FS_COVID_Plan_FINAL.pdf) in place before they become ill with COVID-19 like symptoms, including having a plan for testing, and the need for early treatment if infected. In areas where the COVID-19 risk [l](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/community-levels.html)may be higher people at increased risk should wear a mask or respirator that provides them with greater protection, like an N95 or KN95, and may choose to avoid nonessential indoor activities. Their household members, friends, and other close contacts who are vaccine-eligible should get [up to date](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html) on COVID-19 vaccination, including with the updated (bivalent) vaccine booster, to help provide maximal protection to their immunocompromised loved ones and colleagues. The American College of Rheumatology has [guidelines around vaccination timing](https://www.rheumatology.org/Portals/0/Files/COVID-19-Vaccine-Clinical-Guidance-Rheumatic-Diseases-Summary.pdf) for people with autoimmune and inflammatory conditions as well as recommendations for which medications should be paused when patients get the vaccine. Other guidance is available from [the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease](https://gut.bmj.com/content/gutjnl/70/4/635.full.pdf) [, and ](https://gut.bmj.com/content/gutjnl/70/4/635.full.pdf)the [American Society of Transplantation and other transplantation groups](https://www.myast.org/sites/default/files/5-26-21%20ISHLT%20AST%20COVID-19%20vaccine%20statement%20v9.pdf). The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society released a set of COVID-19 [FAQs](https://www.lls.org/who-we-are/covid-19-vaccines-faq-patients-and-caregivers). Finally, immunocompromised individuals should receive [all recommended COVID-19 vaccine doses](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/clinical-considerations/covid-19-vaccines-us.html) when eligible (including the updated (bivalent) booster). No. Proof of medical condition is not required to receive a third (additional) vaccine dose. However, individuals may need to state that they or their children do have a moderate or severe immunocompromising condition. You should also bring photo identification to confirm your identity as well as your CDC vaccination card, so that this additional dose can be added. Vaccination: Records COVID-19 vaccination records in the Virginia Immunization Information Systems (VIIS) are available through the [COVID-19 Vaccination Record Request Portal](https://vase.vdh.virginia.gov/recordrequest.html). This portal can be used to obtain a record of your COVID-19 vaccinations if you have misplaced the vaccine card you received at a vaccination clinic; if your vaccine doses were written on different cards; or if you would like to give a copy of your record to someone else. Enter your name, date of birth, and ZIP code. If there is a match, the system will send a verification code to the phone number associated with your vaccination record, through either a text message or an automated voice call. This prevents other people from accessing your record. Once you enter the verification code, you can view, save, and print your Vaccination Record with QR (short for \"Quick Response\") code. With iOS 15 or 16, you can securely store verifiable versions of your COVID-19 test results and immunization records in the Health app on your iPhone or iPod touch. Vaccine providers in Virginia are required to submit vaccination records to the Virginia Immunization Information System (VIIS), but they may have provided information that's incomplete, out of date, or incorrect. So, it's likely we have your record if you were vaccinated in Virginia, even if it's not available through the request portal. For example, your name or phone number may have been entered incorrectly or may have changed. If you can't find your record, first try the search again without entering a ZIP code. If the record still isn't found, you can contact your vaccine provider to update their vaccination record or call 877-VAX-IN-VA (877-829-4682) for help (Mon-Fri 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET). Some doses administered outside Virginia to Virginia residents may be in VIIS. Doses administered directly by federal agencies such as the Department of Defense or Department of Veterans Affairs are not reported to VIIS. If you would like a record of other vaccinations (besides COVID-19), you may [submit your request online](https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=NCMHWL3HK8). If the information on your vaccination record is incorrect (e.g., missing dose, wrong date or incorrect brand), you should contact your vaccine provider to update their record or call 877-VAX-IN-VA (877-829-4682) for help (Mon-Fri 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET). - Virginia's COVID-19 vaccination records include QR codes - a type of barcode that can be scanned with smartphones. QR codes are commonly used and the technology allows anyone to show proof of vaccination with a digital or printed QR code instead of using a paper COVID-19 vaccination card, and without the need for an app. Vaccination records with QR codes contain the same information as paper records, but in a format that offers greater security and efficiency. Because the QR code is digitally signed by the Virginia Department of Health, it cannot be altered or forged. Information from QR codes is only available if and when the individual chooses to share it. A person vaccinated in Virginia can visit [vaccinate.virginia.gov](https://vaccinate.virginia.gov/)to obtain their free vaccination record with QR code, which can then be saved to a cell phone gallery, printed on paper, or stored in a compatible account, such as Google Pay, CommonHealth, or Apple Health. The COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code will be available to you from the [COVID-19 Vaccination Record Request Portal](https://vase.vdh.virginia.gov/recordrequest.html). The QR code can also be scanned by a tablet or smartphone with the [SMART Health Verifier App](https://thecommonsproject.org/smart-health-card-verifier) [. This](https://thecommonsproject.org/smart-health-card-verifier)will display to the reader your name, date of birth, vaccine date(s), and vaccine type. There are a number of ways you can save your QR code: - Print it - Screenshot it and store it in your photo album - Save it - To your computer - To your smartphone as a file (iPhone/Android) - To your Google Pay Wallet - To your Apple Health account (requires iOS 15) For help with securely storing verifiable versions of your COVID-19 test results and immunization records in the Health app on your iPhone or iPod touch, please visit [https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212752](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212752). The information listed on the QR code is the same information shown on paper vaccination records or cards, which includes name, date of birth, vaccination date, vaccine manufacturer, lot number, and name of provider for each dose of vaccine received. The QR code does not include social security number, immigration status, or any other information not found on paper vaccination records. Because the QR code is digitally signed by the Virginia Department of Health, it cannot be altered or forged. Your vaccination history is stored directly within the QR code, which you control. It's completely up to you to decide whether and when to show someone else your QR code. This COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code can only be scanned by apps or websites that agree to the privacy protections required by the [SMART Health](https://smarthealth.cards/) framework, such as the [SMART Health Verifier App.](https://thecommonsproject.org/smart-health-card-verifier) You can obtain your COVID-19 Vaccination Record with QR Code at [vaccinate.virginia.gov](https://vaccinate.virginia.gov/) on your smartphone, or tablet or computer browser. You can also call 877-VAX-IN-VA (877-829-4682) for help ((Mon-Fri 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.) Vaccination Records with QR Codes are available to anyone whose vaccination record is in the Virginia Immunization Information System (VIIS) and includes a working phone number. If you would like your full immunization record (i.e., COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 immunizations), you may [submit your request online](https://redcap.vdh.virginia.gov/redcap/surveys/?s=NCMHWL3HK8). At this time, all full immunization records will not include a QR code. Individual businesses, employers, and other private organizations are usually allowed to require vaccination or proof of vaccination for employees, customers, and/or other participants if they choose to do so. You should only show any vaccination record to a person, business, or organization you want to know your vaccination information, and only after they tell you what they intend to do with your data and if they will keep it.
