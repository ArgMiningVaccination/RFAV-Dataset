This silky-smooth, lightweight formula absorbs quickly to reveal a visibly healthy, even, and glowing complexion. Description DETAILS: Detox Balancing Face Oil combines potent botanicals and is designed to help skin combat environmental aggressors on multiple levels. Organic plant oils containing omega fatty acids, antioxidants, and vitamins nourish skin while helping to form a protective barrier under which skin can balance and normalize. Jojoba oil is praised for helping to maintain skin's natural oil balance due to its structure closely resembling skin's natural sebum. This face oil is formulated for all skin types using gentle botanicals and can be particularly beneficial for oily or uneven textured skin. Each oil is bottled in sustainable glass packaging. Serums are water-based products that have a smaller molecule size so they can penetrate deeply into the skin. Serums hydrate and provide some of the most potent botanicals that work on deeper layers of the skin. Face oils tend to have a larger molecule size than serums and work on the upper layers of skin. Oils are extremely moisturizing and work to reinforce the skin barrier. We recommend using a serum and an oil daily. Serums should be applied first, allowed to completely absorb, and then an oil should be applied next. USE TIPS: Dispense 4-7 drops onto fingertips and rub together lightly. Gently press oil onto clean face and neck, distributing evenly. If your skin needs more moisture, repeat. Allow oil to absorb for 3-5 minutes before applying further products. For optimal results, before applying the Detox Balancing Face Oil, apply a hydrating serum, such as our Renew Resurfacing Night Serum, Protect Antioxidant Day Serum, or Illuminate BC+ Brightening Serum, and allow to absorb for 2-3 minutes.
