It also amalgamates the best of influences that came in from contact with other civiliz ations be it Greece (resulting in Unani Medicine ), Germany (Homeopathy) or Our sages (which gave us the science of Ayurveda, Siddha as also Yoga & Naturopathy ). An indigenous system is a natural form of medicine outside the stream of Western or allopathic medicine practiced by majority of doctors all over the world today. These systems are Ayurveda, siddha, Unani, yoga and homeopathy (AYUSH). Medicinal plants based tradi tional systems of medicines are playing important role in providing health care to large section of population, especially in developing countries. Indian Systems of Medicine are among the well -known global traditional systems of medicine. India has the unique distinction of having six recognized systems of medicine in this category. They are: 1.Ayurveda 2. siddha 3. Unani 4. yoga 5. homeopathy 6.Naturopathy AYURVEDA Ayurveda is the dominant herbal tradition in India. It still enjoys the faith of a large number of people of our country though it is perhaps, the oldest system of healing in the world. Ayurveda is a classical system of healthcare originating fro m the Vedas documented around 5000 years ago. Around 1000 B.C. the knowledge of Ayurveda was first comprehensively documented in the compendia called Charak Samhita and Sushruta Samhita. As per the fundamental basis of Ayurveda, all objects and living bodi es are composed of five basic elements, called t he Pancha Mahabhootas, namely: Prithvi (earth), Jal (water), Agni (fire), Vayu (air) and Akash(ether). Definition The term \"Ayurveda \" is derived from two Sanskrit words, Ayur and Veda. Ayur means life and Veda means knowledge or science . Therefore, Ayurveda means science of life or way of life. Principle The principle of Ayurveda is based on the concept of five basic elements and tridoshas . According to Ayurveda, the whole universe made up of five basic elements (Panchamahabuthas ) The whole universe includes the material world , plant kingdom and all other living beings . In other words, these five elements together form the basis of all matter. The five elements are - Akasha (ether), Vayu (air), Agni (fire), Jala (water), Prithvi (earth) There is a balanced condensation of these elements in different proportions to suit the needs and requirements of different structures and functions of the body matrix and its parts. Th e growth and development of body matrix depends on its nutrition i.e. o n food. The food, in turn, is composed of above elements. The health or sickness depends on the presence or absence of a balanced state of the total body matrix including the balance b etween its different constituents. The properties, location and manifestations of these elements are as follows 1.Ether : is nonresistance , it is located in the body cavities like mouth, thorax, abdomen, lung cavity, digestive tract. 2.Air: is related to movements, vibrations and oscillations . They manifest movement of muscles , pulsation of heart, expansion and contraction of lungs, functioning of digestive and nervous systems. 3.Fire: concerned to radiation, it manifests digestion , metabolism, temperature, vision and intelligence 4.Water : is related to force and cohesion. Located in cytoplasm, blood, salivary glands, gastric juice. 5.Earth : is concerned to resistance and solidarity . They manifest skin, nails, hairs and bones. Thes e elements manifest in the functioning of our scenes. They are also closely related to our ability to perceive and interact with environment. TRIDOSHAS The five elements combine to form \"Tri Doshas \" i.e. Vata, Pitta, and Kappha . They are the \"Basic Forces' and also known as the \"Pillars of Life\" Vata (Air principle) the elements ether and air Pitta (Fire principle) the elements fire and water Kapha (Water principle) the elements earth and water According to the Ayurveda, sickness is due to the imbalance of any one or more of the three doshas. E.g. Aggravation of Pitta leads to indigestion, skin diseases and liver problems. Diagnosis In Ayurveda diagnosis is always done of the patient as whole. Diagnosis is carried out to find out which dosha is aggravated. For his purpose, Ayurveda diagnosis is done by questioning and by undertaking 8 investigation including nadi(Pulse ), tongue, skin, physical features, stool, urine etc. are examined. Treatment: Treatment includes preventive and curative measures. Preventive measures include personal hygiene, regular daily routine, appropriate social behavior. The curative measures include three major measures including aushadhi i.e. drugs, Anna i.e. di ets and vihar i.e. exercise and general mode of life. The curative treatment consists of Aushadhi (drugs), Ahara (diet) and Vihara (life style). Ayurveda largely uses plants as raw materials for the manufacture of drugs, though materials of animal and ma rine origin, metals and minerals are also used. Ayurveda medicines are generally safe and have little or no known adverse side - effects, if manufactured properly and consumed judiciously following necessary DOs and DON'Ts. Ayurveda is proven to be effective in the treatment of chronic, metabolic and life style diseases for which satisfactory solutions are not available in conventional medicine. Over the years, Kshar Sutra and Panchakarma therapies of Ayurveda have become ve ry popular among the public. Panchakarma is a unique therapeutic procedure for the radical elimination of disease -causing factors and to maintain the equilibrium of humors. Panchakarma include 5 detoxification processes, used to treat di seases, accordin g to Ayurveda. Basti (Medicated Raktamokshana ( Bloodletting ) The Panchakarma therapy minimizes the chances of recurrence of the diseases and promotes positive health by rejuvenating body tissues and bio -purification. Kshar Sutra is a para -surgical intervention using an alkaline thread for cauterization, which is s cientifically validated to be effective in the treatment of fistula -in-ano and such surgical conditions as require excision of overgrown soft tissue like polyps, warts, non -healing chronic ulcers, sinuses and papillae. The importance of treatment is to res tore the balance and harmony of doshas with proper diet and drugs. Selection of the drugs Based upon 1. Rasa (Taste), 2. Virya(Potency) 3. Vipaka (Taste after digestion) RASA Rasa indicates the composition, properties and probable action of the drugs. There are six tastes . Each taste has one or more mahabuthas(elements) and each taste has its own influence on doshas. E.g. Sweet (earth and water ), influences on doshas - Kapha increases, vata and pitta dece ases and promote antibiotic activities Sour - (Water and fire) - Pitta increases -stimulates enzymes. Saline - (Fire and earth) - Pitta increases. Bitter - (Air and fire) - Pitta increases Pungent - (Air and ether) - Kapha and pitta decreases Astringent - (Air and earth) - Pitta decreases and vatta increases VIRYA On the basis of Virya, the drugs are classified into hot and co ld drugs. Hot (Ushna) drugs - Aggravates pitta and pacifies vata and kapha, drumstick pitta, Jeera, amla Vipaka Food and medicine undergoes various changes during digestion (metabolism). The taste after digestion is known as vipaka. The three tastes described under vipaka, sweet, sour and pungent. Sweet - Aggravates kapha and alleviates pitta and vatha Sour - Aggravates vatha Pungent - Aggravates vatha and alleviates kapha HOMEOPATHY SYSTEM OF MEDICINE Homeopathy is relatively a recent system of medicine . The word \"Homeopathy \" is derived from two Greek words Homois meaning similar and pathos meaning suffering . Homeopathy simply means treating diseases with remedies, prescribed in minute doses, which are capable of producing symptoms similar to the disease when they taken by the healthy people. It is based on the natural law of healing. \"Similia Similibus Curantur\" which means \"Likes are cured by likes\" ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT HOMEOPATHY Homeopathy = homois (similar) + pathos (suffering) . Homeopathy is a specialized method of drug therapy curing a natural disease by administration of drugs. Homeopathy began in the late 1700s, developed by a German doctor named Samuel Hahnemann. Homoeopathy is a system of medical treatment introduced by Dr. Christian Friedrich Samual Hahnemann , a German physician . He had spread a long and useful life of 88 years during which he benefited the suffering humanity immense by introducing this new system of medicine. DIFINATION & MEAN ING Homoeopathy is a system of treatment ( branch of medical science) works on the principle of ''Similia similibus curenter' 'Means like cures like, further explanation is that patient & medicine symptoms are similar , it also called LAW OF SIMILA ABOUT THE FOUNDER DR. HAHNEMANN The Founder of homoeopathy was born on10thApril, 1755 at Meissen in Saxony of Germany. He was basically a M.D Medicine allopathic doctor who turned in to Homoeopath. He Died on 2ndjuly 1843. FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF HOMOEOPATHY 1. Law of Similia 2. Law of Simplex 3. Law of Mi nimum 4. Doctrine of Drug proving 5. Theory of Chronic disease 6. Theory of Vital force 7. Doctrine of Drug -dynamization Principle The cause of the disease itself can be its treatment i.e. Law of similar. This is the basic principle of homeopathy. According to Hahnemann, diseases are congenital and caused by gene mutations. Toxic or poisonous substances are called Miasms are responsible for gene mutation Miasms are of three types - Psora , Psychosis, Syphilis These exist in a suppressed or sleeping state in a person. As long as they are in that state, the person does not suffer from diseases due to resistance power. If any one of them stimulated, then the person loses his resistance power and suffers from diseases related to it. Therefore, Homeopathy is called a Genetic medicine Discovery of drugs The drugs are discovered by testing on humans but not on animals. A drug is administered on healthy person to induce any one of the miasms and the symptoms of the drugs are discovered Treatment The treatment is based on the concept of proving and prover. Prover - The healthy person. Proving - The symptoms (Physical, mental, emotional changes) that are caused by the various potencies of medicines in prover. For the treatment, the symptoms of the drug are compared with the symptoms of the patient . In other words, the selection of the drug depends upon the symptoms of the drug and patient condition. Remedies used in homeopathy are derived from naturally occurring subst ances such as plant extract and minerals. Extremely low concentrations are prepared in specific way. Homeopathy has definite and effective treatment for chronic diseases such as diabetes, arthritis, bronchial asthma, immunological disorder, behavior disord er and mental disorder. Unani The Unani System of Medicine has a long and impressive record in India. It was introduced in India by the Arabs and Persians sometime around the eleventh century. Today, India is one of the leading countries in so for as the practice of Unani medicine is concerned. It has the largest number of Unani educational, research and health care institutions . Unani name is derived from the word 'Ionian' which originated i n Greece. Unani medicine, like any other form of medical science strives to find the best possible ways by which a person can lead a healthy life with the least or zero sickness. Origin & De velopment of Unani System Unani system originate d in Greece. Hakim Ajmal Khan IS UNANI physician but also one of the foremost freedom fighters in the country . He established an Ayurvedic and antino Tibbia College and Hindustani Davakhana - a pharmaceutical company -for Ayurvedi c and Unani medicine in Delhi. Today the Unani system of medicine with hospitals and educational and research institutions , forms an integral part of the national health care delivery system. Unani Medicine as a healing system was founded by Hakim Ibn Sina. It was introduced in India around 10th century with the spread of Islamic civilization. Now Unani -pathy has become a part of Indian system of Medicine and India is one of the leading countries so far as its pra ctice is concerned. Principles & Concepts According to the basic principles of Unani the body is made up of the four basic elements i. earth, air , water, fire which have different temperaments i.e. cold, hot, wet, dry. After mixing and interaction of four elements a new compound having new temperament existence. i.e Hot wet, hot dry, cold wet, and cold and dry. The body has the simple and compound organs which got their nourishment (The substances necessary for growth, health, and good condition) through four humours i.e. Blood , phle gm, yellow bile and black bile. The humour (put into a good mood) is also assigned temperament as blood is hot and wet , Phlegm is cold and hot, Yellow bile is hot and dry and Black bile is cold and dry. Phlegm is cold and hot (Thick , sticky, stringy mucus secreted by the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract, as during a cold or other respiratory infection). Yellow bile is hot and dry (A yellow, or greenish , viscid fluid, usually alkaline in reaction , secreted by the liver. It passes into the intestines , where it aids in the digestive) Black bile is cold and dry (a humor that was once believed to be secreted by the kidneys or spleen and to cause sadness) Unani medicine believes in promotion of health , prevention of diseases and cure. Health of human is based on the six essentials - Atmospheric air - Physical activity and rest - Drinks and foods - Sleep and wakefulness - Excretion and retention - Mental activity and rest The human body is considered t o be made up of the following seven components are: i. Elements (Arkan) ii. Temperament (Mizaj) iii. Humors (Akhlat) iv. Organs (Aaza) v. Spirits (Arwah) vi. Faculties (Quwa) vii. Functions (Afaal) Elements (Arkan) The human body contains four elements. (earth, air , water, fire). Each of the four elements has its own temperament as follows: Element Temperament Air Hot and Moist, Earth Cold and Dry, Fire Hot and Dry, Water Cold and Moist Temperament (Mizaj) In the Unani system, the temperament of the individual is very important as it is considered to be unique. The individual's temperament is believed to be the result of the interaction of these four elements. Humors (Akhlat) Humours are those moist and fl uid parts of the body which are produced after transformation and metabolism of the aliments; they serve the function of nutrition, growth and repair; and produce energy, for the preservation of individual and his species. The humors are responsible for maintaining moisture of different organs of the body and also provide nutrition to the body. Organs (Aaza) These are the various organs of the human body . The health or disease of each individual organ affects the state of health of the whole body. Spirits (Arwah) Ruh (Spirit) is a gaseous substance, obtained from the inspired air, it helps in all the metabolic activities of the body. It is the source of vitality for all the organs of the body. These are considered to be the life force and are , therefore, important in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. These are the carriers of different powers, which make the whole body system and its parts functional. Faculties (Quwa) These are of three kinds: 1.Natural power (Quwa Tabiyah) Natural power is the power of metabolism and reproduction . Liver is the seat of this power and the process is carried on in every tissue of the body . Metabolism is concerned with the processes of nutrition and growth of human Nutrition comes from the food and is carried to all parts of the body, while growth power is responsible for the construction and growth of human organism. Psychic power refers to nervous and psychic power . It is located inside the brain and is responsib le for perceptive and motive power. Perceptive power conveys impressions or sensation and motive power brings about movements as a response to sensation. 2.Vital power (Quwa Haywaniyah) Vital power is responsible for maintaining life and enables all the organs to accept the effect of psychic power. This power is located in the heart. It Keeps life running in the tissues . 3Functions (Afaal) This component refers to the movements and functions of all the organs of the body. In case of a healthy b ody the various organs are not only in proper shape but are also performing their respective functions. This makes it necessary to have full knowledge of the functions of the human body in full detail Diagnosis: The diagnosis of a disease is done by feeling pulse, observation of urine, stool color of skin and gait etc. The Diagnostic process in Unani system is dependent on observation and physical examination. Diagnosis involves investigating the causes of disease thoroughly and in detail. For this, the physicians depend mainly on pulse reading and examination of urine and stool. The ten conditions of pulse observed during the diagnosis are: i. Quantity ii. Force iii. Duration of movement iv. Condition of the vessel wall v. Volume vi. Duration of the rest period vii. Palpitation of the pulse viii. Equality and inequality ix. Balance of the pulse x. Rhythm Physical examination Is carried out by the diagnosis of urinogenital disorders, pathogenesis of blood and other humors , metabolic disorders and liver diseases. The following observations of urine are made: Colour, Consistency, Clearness and turbidity, Odour Foam or froth, Precipitates, Quantity The examination of stool, its colour, quantity, consistency and the presence of foreign body help very much in the diagnosis of various diseases. Besides the means of pulse reading and physical examination of urine and stool, other conventional means such as inspection, palpitation, percussion and occultation are also used for diagnosis purposes . Strength of Unani: Unani system of Medicine has very remarkable strength in the following disorders: Skin disorders , Digestive disorders , Mental disorders disorders , Gynecological disorders , Neurological disorders Treatment: The treatment comprises of three components namely preventive and curative it seeks the restoration of the body as whole to its original state . Treatment is carried out in the four form i.e. regimental therapy, pharmaco therapy dieto therapy and surgery. Regimental Therapy -It includes venesection, diaphoresis, diuresis, Turkish bath, massage, cauterization, exercise and leec hing. These are the drugless therapies and are found to be effective in treating diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, arthritis and migraine etc. Dietotherapy -It deals with certain ailments by administration of specific diets or by regulating the quant ity and quality of food. Pharmacotherapy - It deals with the use of naturally occurring drugs mostly herbal drugs of animal and mineral origin. The drugs are used singly or in the form of infusion, powder and syrup Unani system of medicine specializes on rheumatic arthritis, jaundice, filariasis, eczema, sinusitis and bronchial asthma. NATUROPATHY Naturopathy is not only a system of treatment but also a way of life. It is often referred to as a drugless therapy. Special attention a is being given to eating habits using only natural, mostly uncooked food (fruits and vegetables, adoption of purificat ory practices, use of hydrotherapy, cold -packs, mud -packs, bath massage and variety of methods to tone up the system, increasing energy level aimed at producing a state of good health and happiness. Naturopathy is holistic system and it helps promote physi cal mental /emotional, social and spiritual health by self -regulation of life activities on normal and natural basis. It requires real effort, will power and proper discipline to follow naturopathy way of life. Naturopathy Naturopathy advocates living i n harmony with constructive principles of Nature on the physical, mental, moral and spiritual planes. Naturopathy promotes healing by stimulating the body's inherent power to regain health with the help of five elements of nature - Earth, Water, Air, Fire and Ether. Naturopathy advocates 'Better Health without Medicines'. It is reported to be effective in chronic, allergic autoimmune and stress related disorders. Naturopathy The theory and practice of Naturopathy are based on a holistic view point with p articular attention to o simple eating and living habits, o fasting, o hydrotherapy -body packs, baths o mud packs, massages, o Under Water Exercises, o Air therapy o Magnet Therapy, Chromo -therapy, o Acupuncture, Acupressure etc. Homoeopathy The Phy sicians from the time of Hippocrates (around 400 B.C.) have observed that certain substances could produce symptoms of a disease in healthy people similar to those of people suffering from the disease. Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, a German p hysician, scientifically examined this phenomenon and codified the fundamental principles of Homoeopathy. Homoeopathy was brought into India around 1810 A.D. by European missionaries and received official recognition in 1948 by the Parliament. First prin ciple of Homoeopathy 'Similia Similibus Curentur' - a medicine which could induce a set of symptoms in healthy human beings would be capable of curing a similar set of symptoms in human beings actually suffering from the disease. Second principle of 'Sing le Medicine' - Single medicine should be administered at a time to a particular patient during the treatment. Third principle of 'Minimum Dose' - bare minimum dose of a drug which would induce a curative action without any adverse effect should be adminis tered. Homoeopathy is based on the assumption that the causation of a disease mainly depends upon the susceptibility or proneness of an individual to the incidence of the particular disease in addition to the action of external agents like bacteria, viruse s, etc. Homoeopathic medicines are prepared mainly from natural substances such as plant products, minerals and from animal sources. Homoeopathy has its own areas of strength in therapeutics and it is particularly useful in treatment for allergies, autoim mune disorders and viral infections. Many surgical, gynecological and obstetrical and pediatric conditions and ailments affecting the eyes, nose, ear, teeth, skin, sexual organs etc. are amenable to homoeopathic treatment. Behavioral disorders, neurological problems and metabolic diseases can also be successfully "}
