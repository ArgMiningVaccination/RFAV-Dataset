PUBLIC HEALTH IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM Commissioner : Joxel Garcia, M.D., M.B.A. Governor : John G. Rowland IMMUNIZATION ACTION PLAN O n May 11, the Food and Drug Admin i- stration (FDA) approved a new comb i- nation vaccine that protects individuals 18 years of age or older against diseases caused by the hepatitis A virus (HAV) and the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The vaccine, called Twinrix, combines two already approved va c- cines, Havrix (Hepatitis A vaccine, Inact i- vated) and Engerix -B (Hepatitis B vaccine, recombinant) so that people at high risk for exposure to both viruses can be immunized against both at the same time. For example, Twinrix is reco m- mended for travelers who, due to certain b e- haviors or occupations, are at high risk for HBV, and are visiting countries where there is a high or intermediate rate of both HAV and HBV disease. Areas with a high rate of both HAV and HBV include Africa, parts of South Ame r- ica, and most of the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia. HAV infection can be contracted by ingestion of contaminated water or food. Travel to certain areas of the world with poor hygienic conditions or being in places where usual sanitary conditions have broken down, such as a flood region, can increase the risk of HAV infection. HAV infection may be symptomatic. However, s ymptoms occur more frequently in older age groups and typ i- cally include fever, malaise, and jaundice. Rarely, patients with HAV infection progress to liver failure and death HBV infect ion is spread through contact with infected blood or other body fl u- ids, through using contaminated needles or having unprotected sex with an infected pe r-son. Health care workers are also among those considered at risk. HBV infection may also be asymptomatic or result in similar symptoms to HAV infection. However a small number of HBV infection in adults result in chronic hepatitis leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Clinical trials of Twinrix, given in a three dose series at 0 -, 1- and 6 months, demonstrated that the combin ation vaccine was as safe and effective as the already l i- censed separate HAV and HBV vaccines. SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceut i- cals, in Philadelphia, PA. will market and di s- tribute Twinrix. \u0089 W hile one combination vaccine has been a pproved another has been asked to submit further data before being licensed. The combination vaccine that would have dramatically reduced the number of injections a child would receive has been rejected by the FDA. A closely divided adv i- sory panel to the FDA voted that the agency should not approve GlaxoSmithKline's Infa n- rix DTaP -Hepatitis B -IPV combination va c- cine for infants. The proposed vaccine co m- bines four already -approved infant vaccines with an as -yet unlicensed formulation of ina c- tivated polio vaccine Availability of the co m- bination would have cut from 20 to 9 the number of injection infants need in order to be up -to-date with their immunizations in the first 18 months of life. However, several pa n-elists felt that the sponsor's studies contai n- ing more than 7,000 patients in the US and Germany were too small to conclusively su p- port results suggesting that giving the 5 - vaccine combination was just as effective at eliciting an immune response as giving its components separately. Experts were also troubled by pivotal trials that did not look at how the combination's overall immunogeni c- ity might be affected by other vaccines on the immunization schedule. Other concerns i n- cluded the lack of knowledge about how the vaccine will behave when given with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevnar, and increased rates of fever in infant subjects who had received the 5 -combination vaccine. In the company's largest trial, 43% of infants who received the combination vaccine deve l-oped fever within 4 days compared with 26% of infants who received sequential vaccin a- tions. In the end, several panelists had asked the company to submit a new efficacy and safety trial with larger numbers and a greater ethnic diversity of patients. The lar g- est trial in the company's series was pe r- formed in Germany, where more than 96% of the subjects were Caucasian. Those nu m- bers had some experts questioning how the vaccine would function in a more genetically diverse US population. \u0089 A t a public briefing on Monday, April 23, the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) Co m- mittee on Immunization Safety Review r e- leased a report in which they reject a causal relationship between the measles -mumps - rubella (MMR) vaccine and autism spectrum disorder, commonly known as autism. The committee concluded that: The epidemiological evidence shows no association between MMR and autism; Case studies based on small numbers of children with autism and bowel disease do not provide enough evidence to draw a conclusion about a causal relationship between these symptoms and admin i- stration of the vaccine Biological models linking MMR and a u- tism are \"fragmentary\" (Continued on page 2) NEW COMBINATION VACCINE APPROVED FOR PROTECTION AGAINST TWO HEPATITIS VIRUSES INSIDE: VACCINE UPDATE....................2 REGISTRY UPDATE...................3 NEW IAP SITES........................3 RESULTS OF SCHOOL SURVEY...................................4 NEW COLLEGE LAW ................4 MORBIDITY REPORT................4 FDA ADVISORY PANEL URGES NOT TO APPROVE GLAXOSMITHKLINE VACCINE IOM COMMITTEE REJECTS CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MMR AND AUTISM DTaP Beginning with June's vaccine orders, the State Immuniz a- tion Pr ogram over to preservative -free Tripedia (manufactured by Aventis Pasteur) which comes packaged in ten si ngle-dosed vials per box. We will also continue to supply Infa n- rix (manufactured by Glaxo SmithKline), which is also thimerosal -free. As a reminder, whenever possible, the same brand of DTaP vaccine should be used for all doses of the vaccination series. Finally, many providers have seen their DTaP orders r e- duced from what they had originally ordered. Providers should keep in mind that we are limiting each provider to a 2 month sup ply of DTaP based on their previous month's usage and current inventory. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) i s limiting the amount of DTaP each state can have in their inventory so with a li m- ited supply we need to make sure every provider has at least some DTaP on hand. We anticipate that the DTaP supply will improve in the coming months. Hepatitis A A working group on Hepatitis A has been formed among me m- bers of the infectious Disease Division of the state health department to deal with an increase in the reported number of cases of the disease, especially in New Haven County. Since the beginning of the year, 39 cases of Hep. A have been reported amongst males 18 years of age and older, compared to just 20 cases reported all of last year. New Haven county has seen a 300% i n- crease in Hep. A (18 cases in 2001 from just 6 in 2000). Many of these cases are occurring in the MSM (men who have sex with me n) population. A meeting with members of the New Haven Health D e- partment, DPH staff, the Hartford Gay & Lesbian Health Collective, and community based organizations in the New Haven area was h eld to address the issue and formulate a plan to vaccinate high risk ind i- viduals. Varicella Since varicella (chickenpox) became a vaccine reportable disease on January 1, 2001, nearly 500 cases have b een re- ported to the Immunization Program. All day care providers, schools, physicians, and local health departments are required to r e- port any case of varicella. Hepatitis B Since the Regulations of the State of Connecticut were changed to require proof of imm unity against hepatitis B for entry into 7th and to 8th grade, several new regimens for hepatitis B vaccination of adolescents have been approved by the FDA. These regimens are either compressed in time (3 doses over 4 months) or require fewer doses (2 doses of adult formulation instead of 3 doses of formulation for children). In addition, with a complete series of hepatitis B vaccinations now required for entry into 8th grade, the timing between doses of the vaccine has gene rated a considerable amount of interest. After consulting with several individ u- als at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), new guidelines have been established with regards to what should be co n- sidered adequate vaccination for school entry for adolescents. These guidelines supercede Section 10 -204a -2g(3a) of the school immuniz a- tion regulations until such time that the regulations can be modified. Any adolescent student shall be considered adequately pr o- tected against hepatitis B if that individual was: 1.Immunized with at least 21 days spacing between doses 1 and 2, at least 2 months spacing between doses 2 and 3, and at least 4 months spacing b etween doses 1 and 3. 1.Immunized between the ages of 11 -15 years old with Merck's 2 dose adolescent hepatitis B vaccine (brand name: Reco m- bivaxHB, 10 mcg), with the two doses spaced at least 4 months apart. Documentation of the brand name and dosage must be submitt ed for this regimen to be considered complete for school entry purposes. Td A shortage of tetanus and diphtheria toxoids (Td) a nd tetanus toxoid (TT) in the United States has resulted due to one of two manufactu r- ers discontinuing production of tetanus toxoid -containing products. Aventis Pasteur is the only major manufacturer of tetanus and Td in the US. In response to the shortage, Aventis has increased production of Td to meet national needs: however, since 1 1 months are required for vaccine production, the shortage is expected to last for the remainder of 2001. To assure vaccine avai l- ability for priority indication, all routine Td boosters in adolescents and adults should be delayed until 2002. Td use should follow exiting re c- ommendation for all other indications, which include 1) persons trave l- ing to a country where the risk for diphtheria is high; 2) persons requi r- ing tetanus vaccination for prophylaxis in wound management; 3) pe r- sons who have received fewer than 3 doses of any vaccine contai n- (Continued on page 3) Page 2 (Continued from page 1) There is no relevant animal model lin king MMR and autism. Therefore, the committee recommended maintaining the current pol i- cies relating to licensure and administration of the MMR vaccine in the Untied States. The committee chair, Marie C. McCormick, M.D., Sc. D., professor of maternal and child health at the Harvard School of Public Health, stated at the briefing that while n o vaccine is 100% safe, the MMR vaccine is \"as safe as a vaccine can get.\" The committee reviewed published and unpublished mat erial, and also heard testimony from a variety of witnesses, including Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the author of a well -publicized stu dy published in the Lancet in 1998. This study seemed to indicate that the onset of autism and gastrointestinal problems were a ssociated with the receipt of the MMR vaccine. Dr. McCormick noted that the Wakefield study was published as an observation for further investigation and never claimed to prove the relationship. She further noted that the commi t- tee reviewed numerous studies that examined Wakefield's hypothesis and were unable to find evidence to support it. Current rese arch on autism has established that there is a strong genetic component to the disease, however the committee r e- port notes that other factors, including infectious, neurologic, met a-bolic, immunologic, and environmental insults, may play significant roles.\" Therefore, although the committee felt that a relationship b e- tween MMR vaccine and autism would be extremely rare, if it occurred at all, they recommend that research to examine this possible relatio n- ship continue. The IOM's Committee on Immunization Safety Review was convened in fall 2000 to provide an independent review and asses s- ment of increasingly prominent vaccine safety concerns. It will exa m- ine nine vaccine -safety hypotheses over the next three years. The 15 committee members have expertise in pediatrics, internal m edicine, immunology, neurology, infectious diseases, epidemiology, biostati s- tics, public health, risk perception, decision analysis, nursing, genetics, ethics, and health communications. To prevent any perception of co n- flict of interest, anyone with financial ties to vaccine manufacturers or their parent companies, and anyone who had served on vaccine adv i- sory committees, provided expert testimony, or published papers on issues of vaccine safety are excluded from participating on the co m- mittee.\u0089 Local IAP Coordinators Bridgeport Rory Angulo (203) 332 -Burlington (860) 584 -7682 Danbury Irene Litwak (203) 792 -4120 East Hartford Vacant (860) 291 -7324 Hartford Susan Vater (860) 547 -1426 X7057 Meriden Kate Middletown Barbara Ricketts (860) 704 -5782 Naugatuck Valley Kim Blount (203) 924 -9548 New Britain Ramona Anderson (860) 612 -2777 New Haven Jennifer Rich (203) 946 -7485 New London Susan Curcio (860) 447 -8322 Northeast Region Janet Johnson (860) 928 -6541 X2013 Norwalk Pam Bates (203) 854 -7728 Stamford Marge Kappas (203) 977 -5098 Torrington Sue Sawula 489 -0436 Waterbu ry Randy York (203) 574 -6880 West Haven Betty Murphy (203) 937 -3665 Windham Karin Davis (860) 423 -4534 Page 3 TWO NEW IAP SITES ADDED The IAP Program is expanding. Bristol -Burlington Health District and East Hartford Health Depar tment have been added to the existing sites to bring the total to 18 IAP sites strategically situated in areas of the state consi dered to be at risk for under -immunization. Each IAP site has been contracted by the State Health Department to: (1) improve immunization coverage by convening an immunization adv i- sory meeting with members of the community, collect and maintain referrals of children at risk for being late with immunizations, and conduct ou treach (2) conduct educational outreach activities for the general public to increase awareness of the importance of early childhood immunization, (3) perform immunization assessments of public imm unization providers in the community to determine the immunization rate for the practice and monitor compliance with standards of pediatric immuniz a- tion practice, and (4) assist in the statewide impl ementation of the CIRTS immunization registry. The addition of these two sites will facilitate a broader network of immunization outreach to Co n- necticut's under -served population. Since the rejection of the pr e- ferred vendor's registry software, State Immunization Registry perso nnel have been fine tuning the existing CIRTS system. In the near future, staff will be upgrading cu r- rent software to give more accessibility to end -users. The Remote Application Ma n- ager, which a llows access to CIRTS will be replaced with new clients on the remote end users PC. In addition to allowing more providers to ac cess the system, providers will now have a local number to call instead of an 800 number resulting in NO busy signals and no denied access while other operations are performed. This upgrade will allow individual practices/ clinics who are a lready on -line with CIRTS to generate state Health Assessment Record forms for school, day care and camp (i.e. \"blue forms\" needed for school entry). All three forms will have the immunization hi story of the child printed in the appropriate place on the form. In 1998, all children born in the state of Connecticut were en rolled into CIRTS. By now, these children should have completed their primary series of vaccinations. CIRTS can gene r- ate, upon request, customized immunization rate reports for this birth cohort for any individual pra c- tice/clinic. REGISTRY UPDATE School Immunization Survey -Statewide Results from the 2000 -2001 retr o- spective school survey are complete and show the overall statewide i m- munization rate for 4:3:1 (4 doses of DTP, 3 doses of polio, and 1 dose of MMR) at 24 months of age is 86.8% , and increase of near ly 5% from last year's figure. The retrospective study is compiled from an audit of 25 records at 40 randomly selected ki n- dergartens throughout the state.

The co m- plete text of this notice is available online at www.cdc.gov/mmwr//preview/mmwrhtml/mm5020a8.htm Connecticut Participates in Nationwide Study Connecticut is one of 9 states nationwide that have special surveillance systems for invasive, culture -confirmed pneum o- coccal disease that will be participating in a CDC -coordinated case -controlled study to be conducted over the next 2 -3 years . Cases will involve children 3 to 59 months of age with invasive pneumococcal disease, whose isolates are routinely reported to the Connecticut Department of Public Health. Co n- trols will be randomly selected from the DPH birth registry and matched according to date of birth and mothers zip code at the time of birth. The Connecticut portion of the study is being done jointly by DPH and Dr. Eugene Shapiro and Dr. Marietta Vazqu ez of the Yale University School of Medicine. This study has been approved by institutional research boards at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Connecticut DPH and Yale University.

Box 340308 Vincent Sacco, MS, Program Manager Meningococcal Vaccine Required For College Students Residing On Campus On June 6th, Governor Rowland signed into law, a bill requiring all college students living in on -campus hou s- ing to be vaccinated against meningitis. The new law, which will apply to all public and private colleges and universities will be in effect for the 2002 -2003 school year, and each year thereafter. St u- dents must show proof of immunization with mening o- coccal vaccine or (1) present a certificate from a phys i- cian stating that , in the opinion of such physician, such vaccination is medically contraindicated because of the physical cond ition of such student, or (2) present a statement that such vaccination would be contrary to the religious beliefs of such stude nt. In addition to the vaccine requirement, all Co n- necticut schools of higher education will be required to (1) provide information about meningitis to all prospe c- tive students prior to their matriculation and include with that information notice of the availability and ben e- fits of a meningitis vaccine, and (2) develop procedures for receiving and keeping a record of student vaccin a- tion status. Recent studies have shown college freshmen who live in dormitories to be at a moderately increased risk of mening itis relative to other people their age in the general population.
