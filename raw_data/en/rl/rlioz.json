For the Dallas ISD student population of more than 160,000, only 486 students were not vaccinated for reasons of conscience or religious belief. Trend of no vaccines worries doctors Parents of school-age children in Texas quickly learn the choices: Get your kids vaccinated according to the state-mandated schedule or officially opt out of the vaccines. The vast majority of parents choose the vaccines. But the small number opting out, in Texas and across the country, has grown over the past few years. It has grown large enough that illnesses once thought to be all but eliminated in the United States are flaring up in short outbreaks. Earlier this year, the fear of a measles outbreak was triggered in North Texas when Plano ISD reported one case in a student at Schell Elementary School in Richardson. The child, who had not been vaccinated, had recently returned from a visit to an unidentified foreign country where measles is still common. Nobody else caught the illness from the child. The Dallas Morning News decided to find out how likely it is for students at other North Texas schools not to have been vaccinated. A selection of districts was asked to provide campus-level information about the number of students whose parents opted out. The results are generally reassuring to anybody worried about significant outbreaks. Enter an address Search for a school View by district For the entire Dallas ISD student population of more than 160,000 students, for instance, only 486 students were not vaccinated for reasons of conscience or religious belief \u2014 about three-tenths of 1 percent of the students. But there are some clusters: Eduardo Mata Elementary has 23 students not vaccinated, about 6 percent of the students on that campus. Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts has 25 nonvaccinated students, about 3 percent of the total. There are other pockets of higher nonvaccination rates at some schools in North Texas. In Plano ISD, for instance, 20 students at Aldridge Elementary opted out this year \u2014 3.5 percent of the campus. Norton Elementary School in Allen ISD has 20 students \u2014 3.7 percent. Bledsoe Elementary in Frisco has 37, almost 5 percent. Those small numbers match what is found mostly across the country. But there are places where the rates of refusal are much higher. An outbreak of measles in California in 2014, associated with visitors to Disneyland, spread mostly to people who had not been vaccinated. More than 150 people got sick; 17 were hospitalized. And last year, California passed a law ending the conscience provision from its vaccination requirements. A study of measles and pertussis outbreaks was published last month in the Journal of the American Medical Association. It found that more than half the measles cases in the outbreaks studied showed up in people not vaccinated \u2014 even though they represent a tiny fraction of the total population. For pertussis, a.k.a. whooping cough, the data was not as clear because the vaccine is not as effective. But even for that illness, the percentage of cases in undervaccinated children was dramatically high. Relatively low rates of unvaccinated children still worry health officials. Even though the total numbers remain small, the number of serious cases is growing. Paradoxically, that's because most American children are getting the vaccines. And here's why: Some diseases make people sicker when they catch them while older. A couple of generations ago, measles and chicken pox were most often the bane of small children. Not anymore, said Nina Fefferman, an associate professor at Rutgers University and an expert in modeling the spread of infectious diseases. Fefferman uses a candy analogy to explain this concept, with candy representing a vaccine-preventable disease such as measles. Advertisement \"Imagine there are a couple of people wandering around handing out candy. When someone hands you candy, you can take it and pass it along. The fewer people there are wandering around with candy means it's going to take you longer to get your hands on the candy,\" she said. \"You'll be older by the time you get candy.\" Are any of the local numbers large enough that school or public health officials are concerned about mass outbreaks? Not at this point. How much larger would they need to get before there are serious health worries? That depends on a number that disease experts call the R0. The science of immunity Based on age and grade, Texas public school students are required to be vaccinated for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hepatitis A and B, varicella and meningococcal disease. But not all diseases are equally infectious. Just one person with measles will typically pass the infection on to 12 to 18 other people \u2014 about as infectious as any disease can be. A person with mumps, by contrast, will infect about four to seven people. That number, the average number of people a person infects, is known as the basic reproduction number, or R0. The higher the number, the faster an illness can spread. Vaccines can lower the R0 of a disease like putting a water-filled moat around a fire keeps flames from spreading. If a child with measles goes to school while infectious, he is far less likely to cause an outbreak if most of his classmates are vaccinated. The benefit given to everybody once enough of the population is immunized is called \"herd immunity.\" For measles, the percentage of the \"herd\" that needs to be immune is between 83 to 94 percent. The proportion of kids who need to be vaccinated to stop an outbreak of mumps is lower \u2014 75 to 86 percent \u2014 because mumps is less contagious than measles and has a lower R0. \"That's the beauty of herd immunity. The idea that as long as a sufficient number of people around you are vaccinated you are protected,\" Fefferman said. What is herd immunity? Herd immunity is the proportion of the population that is protected against a disease through vaccination or previous infection. People who are immune to a disease provide indirect protection to unvaccinated individuals by breaking the chain of transmission when a disease enters a population. When no students have been immunized, a large number of the student population are vulnerable to contagious diseases. As more students are immunized, the potential for transmission is reduced. When most of the student population is immunized, it becomes more difficult for the contagion to spread. But Fefferman is frustrated that doctors rely on the concept of herd immunity to persuade parents to vaccinate their children. \"Saying to parents, 'Well, what about other people's kids?' isn't going to get you far,\" she said. \"If you're talking to parents who are concerned about the safety of vaccinations, then altruism isn't a compelling argument. Clearly it's not, because that strategy is failing.\" Instead, Fefferman says, doctors and parents should focus on the fact that some diseases, such as measles and chickenpox, are causing more severe illness now than a generation or two ago. Advertisement \"Measles was a more mild disease in the pre-vaccine era compared to the post-vaccine era,\" said Fefferman. \"Sadly, many pediatricians still use data based on the pre-vaccine era to counsel their patients about measles.\" Not every infection is worse with age. Infections such as dengue fever are milder when caught at an older age. Other diseases, such as whooping cough, follow a different pattern. Young children and older adults are most at risk of severe complications of whooping cough compared with teenagers and adults. Sifting through the research on vaccines and separating the facts from the fiction can be challenging. \"I feel very sympathetic towards parents who are trying to make this decision and who aren't scientists,\" said Fefferman. \"The science is clearly compelling, but if you're not a scientist, how do you make this decision?\" Schools and data The data compiled by The News hasn't been made public before, but it's been part of every school district's information base about its kids. In most districts, the responsibility for each campus rests with the school nurse. They'll know which students haven't been immunized \u2014 and why. There are some clear medical reasons not to get the vaccines: Kids with weakened immune systems, including those getting some forms of chemotherapy or who have had organ transplants, can't take some vaccines. In some cases, children may be living with people whose immune system is so weak that contact with someone freshly vaccinated is a risk. So nurses need to know who these kids are, the better to alert parents if illnesses like chicken pox or pertussis show up in the area. \"If I had a student who had a heart transplant, I'd call that parent. Just to let them know 'we had a case of chicken pox in your child's classrooms,'\" said Maggie Willis, head of health services for Garland ISD. Far more common are children whose parents have opted out using the conscience provision. School nurses stay aware of those students, too. In case of a serious outbreak, the state or county health departments have the power to order all nonimmunized children to stay home from school \u2014 to reduce the risk to themselves and the possibility that they might further spread the disease. Each district knows who those students are, just in case. What the school nurses are not supposed to do is preach the value of vaccines to parents who have chosen to opt out. \"I can tell you my parents have already made that decision,\" Willis said. \"Trying to argue with them is not going to get us anywhere with that.\" Dr. Seema Yasmin, a physician and former CDC epidemiologist, is a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas.
