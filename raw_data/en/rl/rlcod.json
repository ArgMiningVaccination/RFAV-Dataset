In the clinical sciences, methods of evidence integration have played a transformative role in the timely incorporation of science into therapeutic, preventive and cost effective action at the individual and societal level (Fox 2010). Beginning in 2009, researchers began to explore the application of systematic and robust methods of evidence integration in environmental health sciences (Woodruff et al. 2011, Rooney et al. 2014). In 2014, two reports by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) strongly endorsed the uptake of such improved methods of evidence integration in environmental health sciences, and specifically encouraged their use by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in determinations of whether environmental chemicals are harmful to human health (National Research Council 2014, 2014 ). Currently, the US EPA is initiating steps to incorporate principles of systematic review into its IRIS process (National Research Council 2014, US Environmental Protection Agency 2014), while the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences' (NIEHS) National Toxicology Program (NTP) has been developing the tools, expertise, case studies, and other infrastructure that will facilitate increased utilization of systematic review methodologies (Rooney et al. 2014). The Navigation Guide systematic review methodology (Navigation Guide) was developed in 2011 as part of an interdisciplinary collaboration between clinicians, academicians, and practitioners in an attempt to harmonize the approaches for assessing evidence in the clinical sciences with environmental health sciences (Woodruff et al. 2011). The Navigation Guide is a systematic and transparent methodology that that proceeds from best practices in the clinical arena but accounts for the differences in evidence and decision context involved in environmental health risk assessments, such as the reliance on animal toxicology and human observational studies in the absence of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). To date, the Navigation Guide has been applied in four proofofconcept studies: 1. To evaluate the human and nonhuman evidence of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on fetal growth (Johnson et al. 2014, Koustas et al. 2014, Lam et al. 2014). From this application of the Navigation Guide, review authors concluded that PFOA was \"known to be toxic\" to human reproduction and development, based on a finding of \"moderate\" quality and \"sufficient\" strength of both the human and nonhuman mammalian evidence. 2. To evaluate the human and nonhuman evidence of the association between fetal growth and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in order to assess the strength of the evidence of a 'reverse causality' hypothesis: that the size of a developing fetus may affect maternal GFR such that a small 6fetus leads to reduced plasma volume expansion, reduced GFR, and subsequently higher concentrations of biomarkers in maternal serum. This had been proposed as a potential alternate explanation for observational studies documenting an inverse association between prenatal exposure to chemicals cleared renally and fetal growth (Savitz 2007, Whitworth et al. 2012, Loccisano et al. 2013). The authors of this review found insufficient evidence to support the plausibility of the reverse causality hypothesis and recommended further high quality research (Vesterinen et al. 2014). 3. To evaluate the human and nonhuman evidence of triclosan on reproductive and/or developmental toxicity. This review has been completed and the manuscript is in preparation (Johnson et al. 2014). 4. To evaluate the human evidence of the relationship between air pollution and autism spectrum disorder. This case study is currently in progress (Lam et al. 2014). The results of these case studies to date demonstrate that the methods under development by the USEPA and the NTP are fully achievable (Johnson et al. 2014, Koustas et al. 2014, Lam et al. 2014, Woodruff and Sutton 2014). This 5th case study of the Navigation Guide systematic review method in environmental health will assess the human evidence for effects of exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) on human neurodevelopment. The human health rationale for this review relates to the widespread human exposure to PBDEs from consumer products and potential for adverse neurological health effects, as described below. Rationale for Review: PBDEs and Neurodevelopment Polybrominated diphenyl of synthetic brominated flame retardants (used to inhibit or resist the spread of fire) that were introduced commercially in the 1970s (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2013). The general chemical formula of a PBDE is C12H(09)Br(110)O, with the sum of hydrogen (H) and bromine (Br) atoms always equal to 10. Theoretically, there are 209 possible congeners\u2014each congener is given a specific name, the major congeners detected in human and environmental samples being BDE47, 99, 100, and 153 (Chen et al. 2014). The congeners can be classified into 10 broader groups reflecting the degree of bromination (i.e., mono to decabromodiphenyl ethers) (Darnerud et al. 2001). The three major classes of commercial PBDE mixtures that have been produced are cdeca (consisting the early 2000s, before phaseouts of PBDE production in the U.S. and elsewhere, the commercial decaBDE mixture was the largest of these forms in terms of volume on the market, estimated to account for approximately 75% of worldwide consumption of PBDE commercial mixture products annually (de Boer et al. 2000). PBDEs are used as noncovalent additive fire/flame retardants in a variety of consumer products such as plastics, textiles, building materials, household furniture, and electronic equipment to meet flammability standards intended to reduce firerelated damages and injury (Watanabe et al. 1986, Herbstman et al. 2010, Shaw et al. 2010). PBDE production has been attributed to approximately 25% of all chemical flame retardant production, and in particular it had been estimated that 9095% of the use of cpenta BDE was for the treatment of polyurethane foam (Birnbaum and Staskal 2004, UNEP 2012, Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2013). The total estimated production worldwide of PBDE commercial mixtures during 19702005 was between 1.31.5 million tons, with cpenta contributing contributing 102,700119,500, and cdeca contributing 1,110,0001,250,000 tons (UNEP 2012). The US in particular has historically been a major producer and consumer of PBDEs\u2014in 1999, North American industry was estimated to have used 98%, 36%, and 44% of the global production of penta, octa, and decaBDEs, respectively, resulting in a combined total of 34,400 metric tons (Hale et al. 2002)\u2014although due to production and import changes discussed below, the current use estimates are likely to be different. A recent estimate is that approximately 60% of the stock of PBDEs in products in use in 2014 (~70,000 tons of PBDEs) will continue to be in use in 2020 (Abbasi et al. 2015). PBDEs are used in a variety of products like paints, plastics, foam furniture padding, textiles, rugs, curtains, electronic materials, and building materials and can be present at significant quantities (530% of some of these products by weight) (World Health Organisation 1994, Darnerud et al. 2001). Because they are additives rather than covalently bound to consumer products, there is potential for leaching, volatilization, or degradation, leading to consumer and environmental exposures (the level of which varies by congener, with lower brominated compounds generally being more water soluble, volatile, and bioaccumulative) (Darnerud et al. 2001, Watanabe and Sakai 2003, Gill et al. 2004). PBDEs are persistent organic chemicals (the most persistent of all brominated flame retardants (Hakk and Letcher 2003)) that can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the environment; as a result, they are now ubiquitous and can be found at detectable levels in animals and humans around the world (Norstrom et al. 2002, Hites 2004, Sjodin et al. 2008, Herbstman et al. 2010). Manufacturers in the US voluntarily agreed to phase out production of the penta and octa commercial forms of these chemicals by 2004, and in 2006 the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule to require notification of any new production or import of PBDEs (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2013, US Environmental Protection Agency 2014). In 2009, EPA received commitments from principal manufacturers and importers of decaBDE to voluntary phase out its manufacture and import by 2013 and they have encouraged other companies to join the initiative (US Environmental Protection Agency 2014). 8Although production and import of commercial penta and octa PBDE has ceased in the US, Canada, and the European Union (Kemmlein et al. 2009, Environment Canada 2013), and notification requirements for any new production or import of cpenta and cocta BDEs have been imposed in the US, import of products containing these flame retardants may still occur. As noted above, voluntary commitments have been made by the principal manufactures and importer of cdeca BDE to phase out production and import of the substance, however there are no notification requirements for new production or import of cdeca BDE in the US and, as with cpenta and cocta BDE, cdeca BDE may be imported into the US as part of articles. In 2012, the U.S. EPA proposed a rule that would impose the same notification requirements to cdeca BDE that are in place for cpenta and cocta BDE and extend for all three forms, notification requirements for imported articles containing these substances (US Environmental Protection Agency 2012). The proposed rule has not been finalized. Note, the state of Maine has banned the use of decaBDE in residential furniture (Frederiksen et al. 2009) and Washington state has also implemented a ban of decaBDE in mattresses, televisions, computers, and residential upholstered furniture (Washington State 2008). Although decaBDE accounts for the majority of PBDE consumption over the years, the lower brominated congeners are found in the highest levels in the environment. Potential contributors to this may include release from older consumer products containing these PBDEs (Eskenazi et al. 2013), import from countries like China of products into the U.S. products containing lower brominated (Betts 2008, US Environmental Protection Agency 2014), and the general persistence of these chemicals in humans, animals, and the environment. Taken together, this evidence indicates the potential concern for PBDE exposure to the environment and humans. Human exposure to PBDEs can occur through diet, from consuming contaminated fish, fatty foods, and breast milk (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2013). However, oral ingestion or inhalation of household dust and leachates from consumer products is thought to be a larger source, estimated to represent more than 80% of exposures to PBDEs in the US (Stapleton et al. 2005, Wu et al. 2007, Lorber 2008, Sjodin et al. 2008). In particular, young children who crawl on the floor and exhibit frequent handtomouth behavior are at risk of high exposure (Stapleton et al. 2008). Occupational exposures are also of particular concern, since workers handling flame retardant products (i.e., electronic recycling facilities or furniture warehouses) or inhaling contaminated air or dust in these types of facilities may be exposed to high levels of PBDEs. Several biomonitoring studies conducted in workers handling products containing PBDEs as fire retardants (i.e., textiles, electronics, lab equipment production or recycling) have measured elevated PBDE levels (penta, octa, and deca as well as other congener forms) in the blood of exposed workers compared to control populations (up to 5x higher) (Sjodin et al. 1999, Sjodin et al. 2001, Thomsen et al. 2001, Jakobsson et al. 2002, Julander et al. 2005, Thuresson et al. 2005). PBDE exposures in the state of California are among the highest reported worldwide, potentially resulting from an unintended consequence of a state law (California Technical Bulletin 117) promulgated in 1975 requiring filling inside furniture products be resistant to open flame (State of California 2000, Sjodin et al. 2008, Zota et al. 2008, Eskenazi et al. 2011). In the US generally, PBDE 9levels measured in household dust and human biomonitoring samples have been considerably higher compared to other countries (in some cases reported 10100 times higher) (Meironyte et al. 1999, Schecter et al. 2003, Sjodin et al. 2008, Zota et al. 2008, Frederiksen et al. 2009), potentially due to historically higher levels of production and use of products containing PBDEs (Hale et al. 2002). This could also be in part due to another potential unintended consequence of the California Technical Bulletin 117 (TB117) in that manufactures sold TB117compliant products across the US to avoid maintaining double inventory and for defense against liability claims (Stapleton et al. 2012, Natural Resources Defense Council 2014). Recently, TB117 was revised (TB1172013), replacing the requirement for furniture filling to resist open flame to a smolder test for furniture fabric, thereby better addressing the source of potential household fires without the need for flame retardant chemicals (State of California 2013). Furthermore, as discussed earlier, the penta and octa forms of BDE have been phasedout of US production starting in 20032004 and more recent studies have found that PBDE concentrations in house dust, furniture, and human serum biomonitoring samples within California have decreased subsequent to the phase out, although due to relative stability in exposures (chemical persistence in the environment and continued use of older PBDEcontaining products) these concentrations are anticipated to eventually plateau and persist for decades (Dodson et al. 2012, Stapleton et al. 2012, Zota et al. 2013, Abbasi et al. 2015). Once absorbed, PBDEs distribute into body fat. The halflife in humans ranges from 2 to 12 years (Geyer 2004). Knowledge regarding PBDE uptake, metabolism, and elimination is restricted largely to experimental in vitro and in vivo rodent studies (mostly rats and mice) (Hakk and Letcher 2003)\u2014human metabolism and elimination of PBDEs is generally not well characterized (Center for Disease Control and Prevention 2013). Of the three mixture classes, pentaBDE appears to show toxicological effects at the lowest concentrations (Darnerud et al. 2001). PBDEs generally are suspected endocrine disruptors, thereby warranting concerns regarding development and reproduction, in particular developmental neurotoxicity and thyroid hormone homeostasis (McDonald 2002, Frederiksen et al. 2009). Furthermore, EPA has concluded that there is suggestive evidence of carcinogenic potential for decaBDE (BDE209), the main component of cdecaBDE (US Environmental Protection Agency 2009). Pregnant women, developing fetuses and infants, and children are the most sensitive populations of concern (McDonald 2002, Besis and Samara 2012). Experimental animal studies have demonstrated causal linkages between prenatal exposure to many different PBDE congeners and indices of developmental neurological impairments and deficits (Costa and Giordano 2007). Many studies have reported similar associations in humans as well, reporting significant decrements in motor and mental development as well as potential attention deficits in young children (ages 16) from in utero and early childhood exposures to PBDEs (Chao et al. 2007, Costa and Giordano 2007, Roze et al. 2009, Herbstman et al. 2010, Gascon et al. 2011, Gascon et al. 2012, Hoffman et al. 2012, Chen et al. 2014). Decrement in IQ is commonly used in economic valuations of adverse health impacts. For example, Salkever (Salkever 1995) has estimated that the loss of one IQ point is associated with an 10overall reduction in lifetime earnings of 2.39%. Landrigan et al. (Landrigan et al. 2002) used this estimate to calculate an overall annual cost of $43.4 billion in 1997 dollars from IQ loss attributed to pediatric lead poisoning in the US. In 2011, Trasande and Liu replicated this analysis to update the estimate for the overall annual cost related to IQ loss, estimated to be $50.9 billion in 2008 dollars (Trasande and Liu 2011). Although ADHD outcomes are not as precisely defined in terms of economic valuations, the total excess cost in the US has been estimated. The economic burden in 2000 was estimated as $31.6 billion. This figure includes treatment costs of ADHD individuals and costs of caretakers (i.e., family members) (Birnbaum et al. 2005). A more recent study estimated this cost at approximately $42.5 billion (in 2005 dollars), including treatment related and other health care costs, parental work loss, and juvenile justice (Pelham et al. 2007). These neurological health impacts are of great concern to public health. Even mild decrements in individual IQ can result in serious public health consequences at the societal level (Bellinger 2012). Likewise, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder has serious implications for many aspects of an affected child's life (academic, social, familial) and the lives of an affected child's family (Bagwell et al. 2001, Faraone et al. 2001, Johnston and Mash 2001, Harpin 2005). Furthermore, symptoms of the disorder may persist into adulthood, creating concern for longterm impacts of the disorder (Weiss and Hechtman 1993). These longerterm impacts may include poor social and communication skills, impaired relationships with family and peers, educational and employment problems, emotional impairment (poor selfregulation of emotion, excessive emotional expression such as anger and aggression, reduced empathy, and decreased arousal to stimulation), comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, increased incidence of adverse health risk indicators, and increased incidence of smoking, alcohol use, and illicit drug use (Barkley 2002, Nijmeijer et al. 2008, Wehmeier et al. 2010, Gudjonsson et al. 2012, Spencer et al. 2014). In summary, because of widespread exposure to PBDEs and animal and human evidence of adverse neurological and costly health impacts, we undertook this case study to investigate the evidence for associations between PBDEs and 1) quantifiable measures of intelligence or 2) ADHD and attention related behavioral problems such as hyperactivity, inattention, impulsivity, or response inhibition. Aim Study Question To answer the questions: \"Does developmental exposure to PBDEs in humans affect (1) quantitative measures of intelligence or (2) ADHD and attention related behavioral conditions?\" 11 Objectives: Identify studies or experiments conducted in humans concerning the association of developmental exposure to PBDEs with: 1) quantitative measures of intelligence or 2) ADHD and other attention related behavioral problems; Evaluate the evidence for an effect across studies and if appropriate, conduct a meta analysis of the effects of exposure to PBDEs on 1) quantitative measures of intelligence or 2) ADHD and attention related behavioral problems, and assess for potential sources of heterogeneity; Assess the risk of bias of individual studies and, where appropriate, assess their impact (including direction) on measures of estimated effect size; and Separately rate the strength of the human evidence on the effect of developmental exposure to PBDEs on two neurodevelopmental health outcomes: 1) quantitative measures of intelligence or 2) ADHD and attention related behavioral problems according to one of the following four statements: 1. Sufficient evidence of toxicity; 2. Limited evidence of toxicity; 3. Inadequate evidence of toxicity; or 4. Evidence of lack of toxicity. Methods Review Team At the beginning of the case study, UCSF will assemble a review team consisting of experts from a variety of research fields relevant to the study question at hand (i.e., epidemiology, neurodevelopment, exposure assessment, IQ outcome assessment, ADHD and attention related behavioral problems, biostatistics, and systematic review methodology). Every member of our review team will actively participate in the critical steps of the case study\u2014i.e., developing the protocol, evaluating the quality of evidence, and rating the strength of the evidence. However, in the event that a member of the review team was a coauthor of a study under review, that member must recuse themselves from the evaluating the quality and strength of that study. The review team will also be responsible for the content of the resulting manuscript, including input into the development, writing and editing. In addition, selected members of the review team will conduct the search, apply inclusion, exclusion and risk of bias criteria, extract data, and/or conduct data analysis, based on their expertise. The estimated time commitment for each review team member will range from 5 percent to 50 percent of a fulltime position for the duration of the case study, depending on their specific role. The first author (JL), Project Director (PS) and senior author (TW) will collectively identify potential review team members based on their research interests, expertise, availability, capacity to meet project deadlines, and the absence of any real or potential conflict of interest and invite review team members. The list of coauthors and their areas of expertise, biographical sketches and a completed conflict of interest form are documented in Appendix I. Additional specific roles and responsibilities for coauthors will be documented throughout the protocol, i.e., applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, assessing risk of 12bias for included studies, data extraction and data analysis. The conduct of the case study, its conclusions and publications are the sole responsibility of the review team members. Throughout the course of the review we will also engage topic experts with a broader set of interests and expertise. Topic experts will provide consultation at various steps along the process as needed. We will document and acknowledge the contribution of all individuals who participated as topic experts. The contribution of topic experts is limited to advising the review team and does not constitute authorship or agreement or disagreement with the review team's findings. Criteria for Selecting Studies We will select studies in which exposure to PBDEs was documented, measured, or estimated, and either the outcomes of intelligence or ADHD and attention related behavioral problems was evaluated. Studies that are eligible for review will address the study question and the characteristics as outlined in the following \"PECO\" aid. PECO Statement \"PECO\" is an aid used to formulate an answerable question in a systematic review of health studies. The acronym stands for \"Population/Participants\", \"Exposure,\" \"Comparator\" and \"Outcomes.\" Population: Humans Exposure: Any developmental exposure to PBDEs that occurred prior to the assessment of 1) quantitative measure of intelligence or 2) ADHD and attention related behavioral problems. \"PBDEs\" refers to any single PBDE congener, or combination of grouped congeners. \"Any developmental exposure\" is defined as maternal or paternal exposure incurred any time in proximity to conception (as defined by authors of the included study), or exposures to the offspring incurred in utero or in the perinatal or childhood period. Exposures \"prior to the assessment of quantitative measure or intelligence or ADHD and attention related behavioral problems\" include exposures measured in human biological samples prior to or concurrent with outcome assessment. Measures of exposure (PBDE congener levels) will be limited to only concentrations measured in human biological samples. Comparator: Humans exposed to lower levels of PBDEs than the more highly exposed humans. 13This definition is intended to include groups defined by casecontrol studies; for instance comparing the PBDE exposure levels for people with ADHD versus those without. In the event that these exposure levels turn out to be not statistically different, for the purposes of this case study this is still considered a sufficient definition of a comparator group. Outcomes : Any clinical diagnosis or other continuous or dichotomous scale assessment of 1) quantitative measures of intelligence or 2) ADHD and attention related behavioral problems. Quantitative measures of intelligence include Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI), Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), StanfordBinet Intelligence Scale, or the McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities (MSCA). Outcome measures of ADHD and attention related behavioral problems include the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)/1.5 5, Conners' subscales), Disruptive Behavior Disorders Rating Scale (DBD), or Continuous ADHD Confidence Index score. Search Methods We will collaborate with an Information Specialist (LR) who has training, expertise, and familiarity with developing and performing systematic review literature searches (see Appendix I for LR's biosketch and CV). We will employ a variety of methods to identify relevant data, as outlined below. Our search will not be limited by language or publication date. We will perform electronic searches of online databases (PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Biosis Previews, Embase, Google Scholar, and Toxline) using the search terms outlined in Appendix II. Our search strategy and search terms will be developed by a Cochrane trained librarian (LR) who will implement the search for relevant studies. To assist in the development of a list of terms relevant to our search strategy we will use the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) database to compile synonyms for PBDEs, and outcomes related to quantitative measures of intelligence or ADHD and attention related behavioral problems.

We will use the [rn] function to search registry numbers. We will combine the exposure and outcome search using a Boolean search, utilizing the \"AND\" statement to implement the search for papers. PubMed will be considered our primary online database. Records from subsequent database searches will be first compared to the PubMed set then to other databases already searched to identify and remove duplicates. We will document the number of records retrieved with each 16search and the total number of duplicates removed, as well as the database where the duplicate being removed originally occurred. This process will be completed using EndNote. Web of Science and Biosis Previews To develop a Web of Science and Biosis Previews search filter, we will modify the PubMed search filter. This will consist of removing the PubMedspecific MeSH terms and instead using the text search terms and formatting them for the Web of Science database (i.e., removing the PubMed specific [tw] field descriptor). We will perform a topic search in Web of Science, which will search the title, abstracts, authordefined keywords, and \"Keywords Plus\" terms created by Web of Science. Embase We will develop our Embase search filter using the same method as described above for Web of Science and Biosis Previews. We will look up MeSH terms in the Emtree Thesaurus to identify Index terms that will work in Embase. We will use the \"ti,ab.\" function to limit the search to titles and abstracts. We will use the .tn and .rn function to search trade names and registry numbers. Toxline and DART We will develop our Toxline search filter using a similar method as described above for Web of Science and Biosis Previews. We will use the same MeSH terms but remove the field tags as they are not necessary in Toxline. Searching Other Resources We will use other methods to find additional studies that are not identified through electronic searches of bibliographic databases and may be in the grey literature i.e., technical reports from government agencies or scientific research groups, working papers from research groups or committees, white papers, preprints, conference proceedings, personal communications, etc. These methods include: Searching the websites and databases listed in Appendix III. Including conference abstracts from ISI Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews and Embase search results. Hand searching the reference list of all studies that are included after full text review (prior to study author contact, if applicable) and use Web of Science to search for articles that cite the included studies. Personal communication with authors to request unpublished data or if they have knowledge of additional data from other authors. Having experts in the field review of PBDE, intelligence, and/or ADHD review our list of included studies for completeness. 17 Study Selection Criteria All search results will be imported or manually entered into EndNote (Version x7) reference management software. We will use EndNote to eliminate any duplicate references before we begin evaluating the eligibility of the studies identified. Title and abstract screening Each reference will be screened in duplicate. Four reviewers (PS, LD, ND, JM) will independently conduct a title and abstract review of each reference from the literature search results to determine whether it meets the selection criteria for inclusion. Each author will be assigned a nonrandom subset of references to screen, to ensure that all references are screened in duplicate and to ensure that the same two authors do not always screen the same references (i.e. JM will be assigned the first three quarters (75%) of the references; LD the last three quarters (75%); PS the 1st quarter (25%); ND the last quarter (25%)). References which are included at the title/abstract screening level will be subject to a full text review by the same four authors (more detail follows in the next section). In the event that there is a discrepancy between reviewers, the default will be to push the reference forward to the next step in the process (i.e., if the two reviewers disagree on whether the study is relevant at the title and abstract screening level, the reference will be included by default for fulltext screening). To ensure quality control, one author (JL) will perform title and abstract screening of a random selection (using a random number generator assignment) of five percent of the search results or 5 papers, whichever is greater. These determinations will be compared to the other reviewers' determinations for these studies. The review of articles against the prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria will be performed using a structured form in DistillerSR (Evidence Partners; available at: http://www.systematic review.net ), an online application designed specifically for the screening and data extraction phases of a systematic review (see Appendix IV for title and abstract inclusion/exclusion form). Reports in any language, from any year, will be eligible for inclusion. All reports that compare humans exposed to PBDEs to appropriate comparators and evaluate them for either of the health outcomes as described in the PECO statements above will be eligible for inclusion. The title/abstract screening form will be used to screen and EXCLUDE references if one or more of the following criteria are met: 1. Article is a review of PBDE exposure and quantitative measures of intelligence, ADHD, or attention related behavioral problems; 2. Article contains no original data (e.g., editorial, etc.); 3. Article did not involve human subjects (i.e., animal evidence only); 4. Article did not report PBDE exposure; 185. Article did not report outcomes of intelligence, ADHD, or attention related behavioral problems; 6. Other reason (explanation required). The criteria for an article being a review article is separately categorized from other types of non original data so that review articles may be retained and searched in case any of its references may be identified for inclusion. The following instructions will be provided to review authors conducting the title and abstract screening: \"When excluding a reference, please select only ONE (1) exclusion reason. Please review the exclusion reasons in order and select the FIRST exclusion reason relevant to the reference being screened. Please add in any additional notes in the comment box to explain your selection if necessary.\" The following types of records will be INCLUDED at the title/abstract level: Any study conducted in humans on comparative PBDE exposures and 1) measures of intelligence or 2) ADHD and attention related behavioral problems; and Studies with \"exposed\" versus \"unexposed\" or \"less exposed\" comparisons, even if PBDE exposure levels are not quantified. For citations where the database contains no abstract, authors will attempt to obtain the abstracts from an Internet search. Articles for which the abstract remains unavailable will be screened based on titles and PubMed MeSH headings. Any study not excluded based on above criteria will be included for fulltext review. Updated details to instructions and interpretations for title and abstract screening (additional to what is provided here in the protocol) will be added to Appendix IV to document the process of the review team during the screening process. FullText Screening References which are included at the title/abstract screening level will be subject to a full text review by the same four authors involved in title and abstract screening (JM, PS, LD, ND). Each reference will be screened in duplicate and independently. Each author will be assigned a non random subset of references to screen, to ensure that all references are screened in duplicate and to ensure that the same two authors do not always screen the same references (i.e. JM will be assigned the first three quarters (75%) of the references; LD the last three quarters (75%); PS the 1st quarter (25%); ND the last quarter (25%)). One author (JL) will be brought in to settle any discrepancies between the reviewers resulting from each step of the review process if necessary. In the event that the discrepancy cannot be resolved, the default will be to push the reference forward to the next step in the process (i.e., if the two reviewers disagree on whether the study is relevant at the full text screening level, the reference will be included by default). To ensure quality control, one author (JL) will perform full text screening of a random selection (using a random number generator assignment) of five percent or five papers, whichever is 19greater, of search results eligible for full text review. These determinations will be compared to the other reviewers' determinations for these studies. The review of articles against the prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria will be performed using a structured form in DistillerSR (Evidence Partners; available at: http://www.systematic review.net ), an online application designed specifically for the screening and data extraction phases of a systematic review (see Appendix IV for full text inclusion/exclusion form). Citations eligible for full text review will be screened and EXCLUDED if one or more of the following criteria are met: 1. Article is a review of PBDE exposure and quantitative measures of intelligence, ADHD, or attention related behavioral problems; 2. Article contains no original data (e.g., editorial, review paper not relevant to study question, etc.); 3. Article did not involve human subjects (i.e., animal evidence only, case report of single human, or cell lines, etc.); 4. Article does not quantify developmental exposures to PBDE as concentrations measured in human biological samples, as defined by the PECO statement; 5. A quantitative measure of intelligence or ADHD and attention related behavioral problems was not reported, as defined in the PECO statement; 6. There was no comparator group; 7. Duplicate study; 8. Study reported preexisting conditions of genetic origin (e.g., fragile X syndrome); 9. Other reasons (explanation required). The following instructions will be provided to review authors conducting full text screening: \"When excluding a reference, please select only ONE (1) exclusion reason. Please review the exclusion reasons in order and select the FIRST exclusion reason relevant to the reference being screened. Please add in any additional notes in the comment box to explain your selection if necessary.\" Citations will be INCLUDED if they meet the PECO statement criteria, that is, their subjects represent humans, they include exposure comparisons for relevant periods, and they report the outcome of either 1) a quantitative measure of intelligence or 2) ADHD and attention related behavioral problems. For articles (including nonEnglish articles) that are not available in the database, we will attempt to obtain articles from a broad Internet search. Potentially relevant nonEnglish articles will be translated into English to determine eligibility. Data Collection Three authors (JM, LD, ND) will extract the study characteristics and data from all of the included articles in DRAGON (ICF International; available at: http://www.icfi.com/insights/products and tools/dragon doseresponse ), an online Accessbased application designed for the data extraction phases of a systematic review (see Appendix V for the study characteristics data collection form). The data extracted by each author will be compared for quality assurance/quality control. Under the direction of a third coauthor (JL), authors will resolve any discrepancies in the duplicate data 20sets. The extracted characteristics will be used to evaluate reporting quality, risk of bias and/or to conduct statistical analyses; these characteristics were compiled by combining those from a variety of available checklists and criteria (von Elm et al. 2008, Hooijmans et al. 2010, Kilkenny et al. 2010, Guyatt et al. 2011, Higgins and Deeks 2011). For every study that does not report all the data needed for data analysis, we will request these data from the study contact author by email. If study authors do not respond to requests after being contacted through 2 email messages over the course of 1 month, review authors will note that attempts to contact study researchers were unsuccessful. Risk of Bias Determination Risk of bias will be assessed for human studies using domains from the Cochrane Collaboration's \"Risk of Bias\" tool and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's (AHRQ) criteria (Higgins and Deeks 2011, Viswanathan et al. 2012). These tools have been modified to make them appropriate for human observational studies, and include domains that address recruitment strategy, blinding, confounding, exposure assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and conflict of interest (Appendix VI). We have modified these tools and applied them to evaluate risk of bias in three previous case studies applying the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology (Johnson et al. 2014, Johnson et al. 2014, Vesterinen et al. 2014). Informed by empirical data from metaanalyses conducted on pharmacological treatments and studies of risk of bias and sponsorship (Roseman et al. 2011, Lundh et al. 2012, Krauth et al. 2013), we will additionally assess funding source and declared conflicts of interest as potential sources of bias. We will also search for each study in PubMed and note if there has been a retraction of the published article in order to determine if the study may be fraudulent or if any corrections have been published. Three review authors (JM, LD, ND) will independently make risk of bias determinations for each study across all domains and then compare their results. Any discrepancies will be reviewed by PS and discussed among all four. Any remaining discrepancies will then be reviewed by all other review authors. If, upon further discussion the review authors cannot reach agreement on an appropriate risk of bias determination for a particular domain, the rating judgment will be selected as follows: if one reviewer makes a judgment of 'high' risk of bias and the other makes a judgment of 'probably high' risk of bias, the 'probably high' risk of bias judgment will be used, etc. If additional data or information is acquired from study authors, risk of bias judgments will be modified to reflect the updated study information. To ensure quality control, JL will also make risk of bias determinations for a random selection (using a random number generator assignment) of five percent of or 5 included studies, whichever is greater and these will be compared to other reviewers' determinations for these studies. We will attempt to minimize the impact of publication bias by: (1) implementing a comprehensive search of the literature using multiple sources and methods in order to identify published as well as unpublished studies that meet the eligibility criteria; and (2) if possible, using funnel plot analysis and/or other statistical analyses (e.g., Egger regression (Light and Pillemer 1984) and \"trim and fill\" (Duval and Tweedie 2000) of the studies included in the systematic review, as appropriate. These statistical approaches have been recommended only when the number of studies included in the metaanalysis is sufficiently large (Sterne et al. 2011); and so these analyses 21will only be performed when >10 studies are included in the metaanalysis. In the event that the number of studies included in the metaanalysis is too small these analytical approaches will not be pursued. Furthermore, in the event of substantial betweenstudy heterogeneity, these methods are known to perform poorly and so we will test for betweenstudy heterogeneity as well to make the determination of whether this method would be appropriate for the collection of included studies (Higgins 2011). Data Analysis We intend to perform a metaanalysis to summarize the effects of exposure to PBDE on 1) IQ score or 2) ADHD and attention related behavioral problems, and to assess the impact of study design characteristics on findings. Characteristics from each study will be compiled and reviewed to establish comparability between studies or to identify data transformations necessary to ensure such comparability. Key characteristics include: Study design Population studied (including geographic region, age of children when assessed) Exposure levels, method of measurement, and timing of measurement PBDE congener or group of congeners measured Health outcome assessed and test/assessment tool used Type of data/summary statistic available As one example, measurements of intelligence or ADHD and attention related behavioral problems that have been measured at an early age (i.e., <4 years of age) will not be combined in a metaanalysis with other studies measuring at later ages, since evidence exists in longitudinal birth cohort studies of no statistical association at younger ages, but significant associations as children mature (Rauh et al. 2006, Karagas et al. 2012, Chen et al. 2014). These studies will still be included and assessed in the overall body of evidence, but not combined with other studies assessing children of older age. Summaries of these characteristics for each included study will be assessed by two or more reviewer authors (JL, JM, and/or DA) to determine comparability between studies and to identify any heterogeneity concerns. Where appropriate, studies with sufficient methodological homogeneity with respect to population, study design, study duration, exposure level and health outcome among other considerations will be combined in a metaanalysis. If transformations to reported effect estimates are necessary to a common scale across different tests of intelligence or attention, these will be documented. The statistician (SS) will review study characteristics and recommendations of JL regarding metaanalysis. If a metaanalysis is deemed appropriate, JL/SS will identify appropriate statistical methods to analyze the data, and to determine whether further modifications are required prior to performing the metaanalysis. Our proposed approach is to fit linear doseresponse models (with the dose variable logtransformed) to each set of study data. We will first test the data for linearity in the event that nonlinearity appears to be present. From each study, the estimated slope of the linear model and its associated standard error will be collected. We will test these estimates (calculating and interpreting the I2 estimate as well as a chisquared test for heterogeneity) to investigate whether statistical heterogeneity is present. Furthermore, we will attempt to determine the causes of potential heterogeneity among results for studies to determine if a fixed 22effect or random effects model is appropriate. These estimates will then be combined across comparable studies, using either the fixed or random effects model to account for potential heterogeneity across studies. The final quantitative result will be the combined estimate of the slope of the linear doseresponse model with an associated confidence interval. Our analysis plan will be refined by SS/JL as needed based on the data that enter the review. In the event that these proposed methods for data analysis are altered to tailor to the evidence base from included studies, the protocol will be amended accordingly and the reasons for change will be justified in the documentation. To test statistical heterogeneity across the study estimates, we will estimate the variance component corresponding to betweenstudy variability (\"Cochran's Q\"), and use a likelihood ratio test for the null hypothesis that betweenstudy variability is absent. A pvalue of 0.05 or less will be considered statistically significant. Furthermore, to assess the impact of betweenstudy heterogeneity on the metaanalysis, the I2 test statistic will be calculated and evaluated by considering the magnitude/direction of effects, strength of evidence for heterogeneity (e.g., p value from a chi squared test or a confidence interval for I2), and the Cochrane's guide to interpretation as follows: 0%40%: might not be important; 30%60%: may represent 50%90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; 75%100%: considerable heterogeneity. We will also perform sensitivity analyses by examining the effects of excluding studies with particularly heterogeneous results as well as performing subgroup analyses based on excluding subsets of studies with shared characteristics that might be influential. As discussed earlier, if possible, i.e. there are enough studies, we will assess for the presence of publication bias by funnel plotting and Egger regression on the estimates of effect size (Light and Pillemer 1984) and predict the impact of hypothetical \"missing\" studies (Duval and Tweedie 2000). Quality and Strength of Evidence Ratings Upon completion of the data collection, risk of bias determinations, and data analysis, each of the coauthors will independently compare the results of the systematic review to the criteria outlined in the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology for rating the quality and strength of the evidence. All coauthors will be given explicit directions before rating (see Appendix VII, \"Instructions for Rating the Quality and Strength of Evidence\"). The initial quality level of human observational data will be considered moderate, as has been assigned in prior case studies of applying the Navigation Guide methodology (Woodruff and Sutton 2014). Factors that may decrease the quality level of the body of evidence include: 1. Risk of Bias Across Studies: Study limitations - a substantial risk of bias across body of evidence; 2. Indirectness: Evidence was not directly comparable to the question of interest (i.e., population, exposure, comparator, and outcome). 233. Inconsistency: Widely different estimates of effect (heterogeneity or variability in results); 4. Imprecision: Studies had few participants and few events (wide confidence intervals); and 5. Publication Bias: Studies missing from body of evidence, resulting in an overestimate or underestimate of true effects from exposure. Factors that may increase the quality level of the body of evidence include: 1. Large magnitude of effect: Upgraded if modeling suggested confounding alone unlikely to explain associations with large magnitude of effect. 2. Doseresponse: Upgraded if consistent dose response gradient in one or multiple studies, and/or dose response across studies. 3. Confounding minimizes demonstrated effect: Upgraded if consideration of all plausible residual confounders or biases would underestimate the effect or suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect. GRADE provides an illustrative example of rating up observational evidence finding lack of association between vaccination and autism, which occurred despite empirically confirmed bias that parents of autistic children may be more likely to remember their vaccine experience. The negative findings despite this form of recall bias suggest rating up the quality of evidence (Guyatt et al. 2011). Possible ratings for quality of evidence are \"high,\" \"moderate,\" or \"low.\" Possible downgrades or upgrades are: 0 (no change), 1 (1 level downgrade), - 2 (2 level downgrade), +1 (1 level upgrade) or +2 (2 level upgrade). The ratings of the separate factors are not added together into a score, e.g. a 1 downgrade for inconsistency and a 1 downgrade for imprecision does not automatically dictate an overall 2 downgrade for the body of evidence. Judgment is exercised to determine if the rationale behind each downgrade warrants an overall downgrade of 1 or 2 levels. The same applies to upgrading the overall body of evidence. Likewise, a 1 downgrade for one factor and a +1 upgrade for another factor do not automatically cancel out and determine n0 downgrades or upgrades for the overall body of evidence. Authors who decide to rate quality down or up need to specify the 1 or 2 criteria most responsible for their decision while documenting all factors that contributed to the final decision. After independently evaluating the quality of the evidence, coauthors will compare their evaluations and any discrepancies between the reviewers' decisions will be resolved through discussion until consensus is reached, if possible. The rationale for each decision on each of the five factors will be recorded. A lack of consensus on any specific factor does not preclude consensus on the overall quality of the evidence. Subsequent to rating the quality of the evidence, the review authors will rate the strength of evidence. The overall strength of the body of human evidence is based on a combination of four criteria: (1) Quality of body of evidence (i.e., the rating from the previous step); (2) Direction of effect; (3) Confidence in effect; and (4) Other compelling attributes of the data that may influence certainty. The results of rating of the strength of the human evidence will then be compared to the criteria specified in the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology and described according to one of the following four concluding statements: 1. Sufficient; 2. Limited; 3. Inadequate; or 4. Evidence of lack of toxicity (Table 1) (Woodruff et al. 2011, Johnson et al. 2014). Any discrepancies between the reviewers' decisions will be resolved through discussion. The senior author (TW) will be the ultimate arbiter of the discrepancies that cannot be resolved through consensus among the review authors. The results of the review, including implications for public health, will be compiled in a manuscript for submission to the peerreview literature. 24SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Appendix I.

Instructions for Making Risk of Bias Determinations Human Studies Please answer LOW RISK, PROBABLY LOW RISK, PROBABLY HIGH RISK, HIGH RISK or NOT APPLICABLE and provide details/justification. Note: These criteria for judging risk of bias are for human studies only since we are not evaluating animal studies in this case study. These questions have also been modified from previous applications of the Navigation Guide, with edits intended so that answering \"Yes\" to each question aligns with a rating of \"High risk of bias\" and \"No\" \"Low risk of bias.\" 1. Are the study groups at risk of not representing their source populations in a manner that might introduce selection bias? Criteria for a judgment of LOW risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"No\"): EITHER: a) The descriptions of the source population, inclusion/exclusion criteria, recruitment and enrollment procedures, participation and followup rates were sufficiently detailed, and adequate data were supplied on the distribution of relevant study sample and population characteristics to support the assertion that risk of selection effects was minimal. OR b) Although the descriptions and/or data as indicated in \"a\" above suggested the potential for selection effects, adequate support was given indicating that potential selection effects were not differential across both exposure and outcome. OR c) Although the descriptions and/or data as indicated in \"a\" above suggested the potential for selection effects and there was no support indicating that potential selection effects were not differential across both exposure and outcome, selection factors appeared to be wellunderstood, were measured in the data set, and appropriate adjustment post hoc techniques were used to control for selection bias. Criteria for the judgment of PROBABLY LOW risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Probably No\"): There is insufficient information about participant selection to permit a judgment of low risk of bias, but there is indirect evidence which suggests that inclusion/exclusion criteria, 92recruitment and enrollment procedures, and participation and followup rates were consistent across groups as described by the criteria for a judgment of low risk of bias. Criteria for the judgment of PROBABLY HIGH risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Probably Yes\"): There is insufficient information about participant selection to permit a judgment of high risk of bias, but there is indirect evidence which suggests that inclusion/exclusion criteria, recruitment and enrollment procedures, and participation and followup rates were inconsistent across groups, as described by the criteria for a judgment of high risk of bias. Criteria for the judgment of HIGH risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Yes\"): a) There were indications from descriptions of the source population, inclusion/exclusion criteria, recruitment and enrollment procedures, participation and followup rates, or data on the distribution of relevant study sample and population characteristics that risk of selection effects were substantial; and b) There was no support to indicate that potential selection effects were not differential across both exposure and outcome; and c) Adjustment post hoc techniques were not used to control for selection bias. Criteria for the judgment of NOT APPLICABLE (risk of bias domain is not applicable to study): There is evidence that participant selection is not an element of study design capable of introducing risk of bias in the study. 2. Was knowledge of the group assignments inadequately prevented (i.e., blinded or masked) during the study, potentially leading to subjective measurement of either exposure or outcome? Criteria for a judgment of LOW risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"No\"): Any of the following: No blinding, but the review authors judge that the outcome measures as well as the exposure measures are not likely to be influenced by lack of blinding (such as differential outcome assessment where the outcome is assessed using different measurement or estimation metrics across exposure groups, or differential exposure assessment where exposure is assessed using different measurement or estimation metrics across diagnostic or outcome groups); or Blinding of key study personnel was ensured, and it is unlikely that the blinding could have been broken; or Some key study personnel were not blinded, but exposure and outcome assessment was blinded and the nonblinding of others is unlikely to introduce bias. 93Criteria for the judgment of PROBABLY LOW risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Probably No\"): There is insufficient information about blinding to permit a judgment of low risk of bias, but there is indirect evidence which suggests the study was adequately blinded, as described by the criteria for a judgment of low risk of bias. For example, investigators were effectively blinded to the exposure and/or outcome groups if the exposure was measured by a separate entity and the outcome was obtained from a hospital record. Criteria for the judgment of PROBABLY HIGH risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Probably Yes\"): There is insufficient information about blinding to permit a judgment of high risk of bias, but there is indirect evidence which suggests the study was not adequately blinded, as described by the criteria for a judgment of high risk of bias. Criteria for the judgment of HIGH risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Yes\"): Any of the following: No blinding or incomplete blinding, and the outcome measures or exposure measures is likely to be influenced by lack of blinding (i.e., differential outcome or exposure assessment); or Blinding of key study personnel attempted, but likely that the blinding could have been broken so as to introduce bias; or Some key study personnel were not blinded, and the nonblinding of others was likely to introduce bias. Criteria for the judgment of NOT APPLICABLE (risk of bias domain is not applicable to study): There is evidence that blinding is not an element of study design capable of introducing risk of bias in the study. 3. Were exposure assessment methods lacking accuracy? Criteria for a judgment of LOW risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"No\"): The reviewers judge that there is low risk of exposure misclassification, i.e.,: There is high confidence in the accuracy of the exposure assessment methods, such as methods that have been tested for validity and reliability in measuring the targeted exposure; or Lessestablished or less direct exposure measurements are validated against well established or direct methods AND if applicable, appropriate QA/QC for methods are described and are satisfactory, with at least three of the following items reported, or at least two of the following items reported plus evidence of satisfactory performance in a high quality interlaboratory comparison: Limit of detection or quantification; 94 standards recovery; measure of repeatability; investigation and prevention of blanks contamination. Criteria for the judgment of PROBABLY LOW risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Probably No\"): There is insufficient information about the exposure assessment methods to permit a judgment of low risk of bias, but there is indirect evidence which suggests that methods were robust, as described by the criteria for a judgment of low risk of bias. Studies only reporting that the QA/QC items above, if relevant, were satisfactory but not reporting all of the actual numbers may receive a judgment of \"probably low risk of bias.\" Criteria for the judgment of PROBABLY HIGH risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Probably Yes\"): There is insufficient information about the exposure assessment methods to permit a judgment of high risk of bias, but there is indirect evidence which suggests that methods were not robust, as described by the criteria for a judgment of high risk of bias. Criteria for the judgment of HIGH risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Yes\"): The reviewers judge that there is high risk of exposure misclassification and any one of the following: There is low confidence in the accuracy of the exposure assessment methods; or Lessestablished or less direct exposure measurements were not validated and are suspected to introduce bias that impacts the outcome assessment (example: participants are asked to report exposure status retrospectively, subject to recall bias) Uncertain how exposure information was obtained Criteria for the judgment of NOT APPLICABLE (risk of bias domain is not applicable to study): There is evidence that exposure assessment methods are not capable of introducing risk of bias in the study. 4. Were outcome assessment methods lacking accuracy? Criteria for a judgment of LOW risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"No\"): The reviewers judge that there is low risk of outcome misclassification, i.e.: Outcomes were assessed and defined consistently across all study participants, using valid and reliable measures; or Lessestablished or less direct outcome measurements are validated against well established or direct methods; or Appropriate sensitivity analyses were conducted that suggest the influence of outcome misclassification would be minimal 95 AND, if applicable, appropriate QA/QC for methods is described and is satisfactory. Criteria for the judgment of PROBABLY LOW risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Probably No\"): There is insufficient information about the outcome assessment methods to permit a judgment of low risk of bias, but there is indirect evidence which suggests that methods were robust, as described by the criteria for a judgment of low risk of bias. Appropriate QA/QC for methods are not described but the review authors judge that the outcome and the outcome assessment are objective and uniform across study groups. Criteria for the judgment of PROBABLY HIGH risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Probably Yes\"): There is insufficient information about the outcome assessment methods to permit a judgment of high risk of bias, but there is indirect evidence which suggests that methods were not robust, as described by the criteria for a judgment of high risk of bias. Criteria for the judgment of HIGH risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Yes\"): The reviewers judge that there is high risk of outcome misclassification and any one of the following: There is low confidence in the accuracy of the outcome assessment methods; or Lessestablished or less direct outcome measurements are not validated and are suspected to introduce bias that impacts the outcome assessment Uncertain how outcome information was obtained Criteria for the judgment of NOT APPLICABLE (risk of bias domain is not applicable to study): There is evidence that outcome assessment methods are not capable of introducing risk of bias in the study. 5. Was potential confounding inadequately incorporated? List of important potential confounders, collectively generated by review authors (DA, BPL, JM) prior to the initiation of screening for studies based on expert opinion and knowledge gathered from the literature (Eskenazi et al. 2013, Watkins et al. 2013): Tier I: Important confounders Home Inventory Maternal age Maternal education Marital status Maternal use of alcohol during pregnancy Maternal depression 96 Household income/poverty (measure of socioeconomic status (SES)) Gestational exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (active) Child sex Exposure to other neurotoxic agents (i.e., lead) Tire II: Other potentially important confounders: Birth weight or gestational age Number of children in the home Father's presence in the home Preschool and outofhome child care attendance Psychometrician, location and language of assessment Criteria for a judgment of LOW risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"No\"): The study appropriately assessed and accounted for (i.e., matched, stratified, or statistically controlled for) all important confounders (Tier I), or reported that important confounders were evaluated and omitted because inclusion did not substantially affect the results. The determination of specific confounders may also be informed by, but not limited to, the studies included in the overall review, AND the study appropriately assessed and accounted for (i.e., matched, stratified, or statistically controlled for) other potentially important confounders relevant (Tier II), or reported that these confounders were evaluated and omitted because inclusion did not substantially affect the results, AND the important potential confounders were measured consistently across study groups using valid and reliable methods, or the influence of covariate measurement error was determined, through sensitivity analysis, to be minimal. Criteria for the judgment of PROBABLY LOW risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Probably No\"): The study appropriately accounted for most but not all of the important confounders (Tier I), AND this is not expected to introduce substantial bias. Criteria for the judgment of PROBABLY HIGH risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Probably Yes\"): The study evaluated some but not all of the important confounders (Tier I), AND some but not all of the other potentially important confounders relevant (Tier II), AND this is expected to introduce substantial bias. Criteria for the judgment of HIGH risk of bias (i.e., answer: \"Yes\"): 97The study did not account for or evaluate multiple important confounders (Tier I), AND did not account for or evaluate multiple other potentially important confounders relevant (Tier II), OR the important potential confounders were inappropriately measured and/or inappropriately analyzed across study groups. Criteria for the judgment of NOT APPLICABLE (risk of bias domain is not applicable to study): There is evidence that outcome assessment methods are not capable of introducing risk of bias in the study. 6.

Instructions for Grading the Quality and Stre ngth of Evidence A. Grading Quality Each of the categories to consider in downgrading or upgrading the evidence is described in detail below. Please record your results on the chart at the end of each category, including a brief explanation for your ratings. Downgrade Categories Category 1. Quality of Study Limitations (Risk of Bias)(Guyatt et al. 2011) Possible ratings: 0=no change; 1 or 2 downgrade 1 or 2 levels The evidence from studies can be rated down if most of the relevant evidence comes from studies that suffer from a high risk of bias. Risk of bias is rated by outcome across studies. Study limitations for each outcome for individual studies and across studies are summarized in the heat maps. GRADE outlines the following principles for moving from risk of bias in individual studies to rating quality of evidence across studies. 1. In deciding on the overall quality of evidence, one does not average across studies (for instance if some studies have no serious limitations, some serious limitations, and some very serious limitations, one does not automatically rate quality down by one level because of an average rating of serious limitations). Rather, judicious consideration of the contribution of each study, with a general guide to focus on the highquality studies is warranted.a 2. This judicious consideration requires evaluating the extent to which each study contributes toward the estimate of magnitude of effect. The contribution that each study makes will usually a Note: Limitations to GR ADE's risk of bias assessments as stated by GRADE: \"First, empirical evidence supporting the criteria is limited. Attempts to show systematic di fference between studies that m eet and do not meet specific criteria have shown inconsistent results. Second, the relati ve weight one should put on the criteria remains uncertain. The GRADE approach is less comprehensive than many systems, emphasizing simplicity and parsimony over completeness. GRADE's approach does not provide a quantita tive rating of risk of bias. Although such a rating has advantages, we share with the Cochrane Collaboration method ologists a reluctance to provide a risk of bias score that, by its nature, must make questionable assumptions about the relative extent of bias associated with individual items and fails to consider the c ontext of the individual items.\" 103reflect study sample size and number of outcome events. Larger studies with many events will contribute more, much larger studies with many more events will contribute much more. 3. One should be conservative in the judgment of rating down. That is, one should be confident that there is substantial risk of bias across most of the body of available evidence before one rates down for risk of bias. 4. The risk of bias should be considered in the context of other limitations. If, for instance, reviewers find themselves in a closecall situation with respect to two quality issues (risk of bias and, say, precision), GRADE suggests rating down for at least one of the two. 5. Notwithstanding the first four principles, reviewers will face closecall situations. You should acknowledge that you are in such a situation, make it explicit why you think this is the case, and make the reasons for your ultimate judgment apparent. Rating for Risk of Bias (Study Limitations) 0 no change 1 decrease quality 1 level 2 decrease quality 2 levels Rationale for your judgment Human Category 2. Indirectness of Evidence Possible ratings: 0=no change; 1 or 2 downgrade 1 or 2 levels Quality of evidence (your confidence in estimates of effect) may decrease when substantial differences exist between the population, exposure, or outcomes measured in the research studies under consideration in the review. Evidence is direct when it directly compares the exposures in which we are interested in the populations in which we are interested and measures outcomes important to the study question (in GRADE the outcomes must be important to patients). 104Based on GRADE (Guyatt et al. 2011), evidence can be indirect in one of three ways.b 1. The population studied differs from the population of interest (the term applicability is often used for this form of indirectness). GRADE states that in general, one should not rate down for population differences unless one has compelling reason to think that the biology in the population of interest is so different than the population tested that the magnitude of effect will differ substantially. According to GRADE, most often, this will not be the case. 2. The intervention (exposure) tested may differ from the exposure of interest, i.e., a difference in the chemical, route and/or dose. Decisions regarding indirectness of populations and exposure depend on an understanding of whether biological or social factors are sufficiently different that one might expect substantial differences in the magnitude of effect. GRADE also states, \"As with all other aspects of rating quality of evidence, there is a continuum of similarity of the intervention that will require judgment. It is rare, and usually unnecessary, for the intended populations and interventions to be identical to those in the studies, and we should only rate down if the differences are considered sufficient to make a difference in outcome likely.\" 3. Outcomes may differ from those of primary interest; for instance, surrogate outcomes that are not themselves important, but measured in the presumption that changes in the surrogate reflect changes in an important outcome. The difference between desired and measured outcomes may relate to time frame. When there is a discrepancy between the time frame of measurement and that of interest, whether to rate down by one or two levels will depend on the magnitude of the discrepancy. Another source of indirectness related to measurement of outcomes is the use of substitute or surrogate endpoints in place of the exposed population's important outcome of interest. In general, the use of a surrogate outcome requires rating down the quality of evidence by one, or even two, levels. Consideration of the biology, mechanism, and natural history of the disease can be helpful in making a decision about indirectness. Surrogates that are closer in the putative causal pathway to the adverse outcomes warrant rating down by only one level for indirectness. GRADE states that rarely, surrogates are sufficiently well established that one should choose not to rate down quality of evidence for indirectness. In general, evidence based on surrogate outcomes should usually trigger rating down, whereas the other types of indirectness will require a more considered judgment. Rating for Indirectness 0 no change 1 decrease quality 1 level Rationale for your judgment b GRADE includes a fourth type of indirectness that occu rs when there are no direct (i.e., head-to-head) comparisons between two or more interventions of interest. This criterion is not relevant to our study question; it could be relevant to future case studies. 1052 decrease quality 2 levels Human Category 3. Inconsistency of Evidence Possible ratings: 0=no change; 1 or 2 downgrade 1 or 2 levels According to Cochrane, \"when studies yield widely differing estimates of effect (heterogeneity or variability in results) investigators should look for robust explanations for that heterogeneity. ...When heterogeneity exists and affects the interpretation of results, but authors fail to identify a plausible explanation, the quality of the evidence decreases.\" Based on GRADE (Guyatt et al. 2011), a body of evidence is not rated up in quality if studies yield consistent results , but may be rated down in quality if inconsistent . Their stated reason is that a consistent bias will lead to consistent, spurious findings. GRADE suggests rating down the quality of evidence if large inconsistency (heterogeneity) in study results remains after exploration of a priori hypotheses that might explain heterogeneity. Judgment of the extent of heterogeneity is based on similarity of point estimates, extent of overlap of confidence intervals, and statistical criteria. GRADE's recommendations refer to inconsistencies in effect size, specifically to relative measures (risk ratios and hazard ratios or odds ratios), not absolute measures. Based on GRADE, reviewers should consider rating down for inconsistency when: 1. Point estimates vary widely across studies; 2. Confidence intervals (CIs) show minimal or no overlap; 3. The statistical test for heterogeneity which tests the null hypothesis that all studies in a meta analysis have the same underlying magnitude of effect shows a low Pvalue; 4. The I2 which quantifies the proportion of the variation in point estimates due to amongstudy differences is large. (I.e., the I2 index quantifies the degree of heterogeneity in a metaanalysis). GRADE states that inconsistency is important only when it reduces confidence in results in 106relation to a particular decision . Even when inconsistency is large, it may not reduce confidence in results regarding a particular decision. For example, studies that are inconsistent related to the magnitude of a beneficial or harmful effect (but are in the same direction) would not be rated down; in instances when results are inconsistent as to whether there is a benefit or harm of treatment, GRADE would rate down the quality of evidence as a result of variability in results, because the meaning of the inconsistency is so relevant to the decision to treat or not to treat. Rating for Inconsistency 0 no change 1 decrease quality 1 level 2 decrease quality 2 levels Rationale for your judgment Human Category 4. Imprecision of Evidence Possible ratings: 0=no change; 1 or 2 downgrade 1 or 2 levels Cochrane states that when studies have few participants and few events, and thus have wide confidence intervals (CIs), authors can lower their rating of the quality of evidence. These ratings of precision are made as judgments by review authors. The ratings are made by looking across studies, or, if available, on the results of a metaanalysis. GRADE defines evidence quality differently for systematic reviews and guidelines. For systematic reviews, quality refers to confidence in the estimates of effect. For guidelines, quality refers to the extent to which confidence in the effect estimate is adequate to support a particular decision (Guyatt et al. 2011). For the purpose of step 3 of Navigation Guide, we will use the systematic review definition, because the decision phase does not occur until step 4 when recommendations for prevention are made. Thus, when reviewing the data for imprecision, evaluate your confidence in the estimate of the effect. According to GRADE, to a large extent, CIs inform the impact of random error on evidence quality. Thus, when considering imprecision, the issue is whether the CI around the estimate of 107exposure effect is sufficiently narrow. If it is not, GRADE rates down the evidence quality by one level (for instance, from high to moderate). If the CI is very wide, GRADE might rate down by two levels. Rating for Imprecision 0 no change 1 decrease quality 1 level 2 decrease quality 2 levels Rationale for your judgment Human Category 5. Publication Bias Possible ratings: 0=no change; 1 or 2 downgrade 1 or 2 levels GRADE (Guyatt et al. 2011) and Cochrane (Higgins and Green 2011) assess publication bias in a similar manner. Whereas \"selective outcome reporting\" is assessed for each study included in the review as part of the risk of bias assessment, \"publication bias\" is assessed on the body of evidence. GRADE states that \"when an entire study remains unreported and the results relate to the size of the effect publication bias one can assess the likelihood of publication bias only by looking at a group of studies.\" Cochrane's definition of publication bias is \"the publication or nonpublication of research findings depending on the nature and direction of the results.\" Cochrane and GRADE are primarily concerned with overestimates of true effects of treatments or pharmaceuticals, especially related to \"small studies effects\", i.e., the tendency for estimates of an intervention to be more beneficial in smaller studies. There is empirical evidence in the clinical sciences that publication and other reporting biases result in over estimating the effects of interventions (Higgins and Green 2011). 108In contrast, in environmental health, we are primarily concerned with underestimating the true effects of a chemical exposure, since in many cases population wide exposure has already occurred. We are also concerned that studies finding no association are less likely to be published because journals are less likely to publish \"negative\" findings. Applying this inverted concern to GRADE's assessment for publication bias, leads to these considerations when rating publication bias: Early negative studies, particularly if small in size, are suspect. (GRADE is concerned with early positive studies). Authors of systematic reviews should suspect publication bias when studies are uniformly small, particularly when sponsored by the industry. (Same as GRADE) Empirical examination of patterns of results (e.g., funnel plots) may suggest publication bias but should be interpreted with caution. (Same as GRADE) More compelling than any of these theoretical exercises is authors' success in obtaining the results of some unpublished studies and demonstrating that the published and unpublished data show different results. (Same as GRADE) Comprehensive searches of the literature including unpublished studies, i.e., the grey literature, and a search for research in other languages are important to addressing publication bias. Note that Cochrane also states \"comprehensive searching is not sufficient to prevent some substantial potential biases.\" Rating for Publication Bias 0 no change 1 decrease quality 1 level 2 decrease quality 2 levels Rationale for your judgment Human Upgrade Categories GRADE states that the circumstances for upgrading likely occur infrequently and are primarily relevant to observational and other nonrandomized studies. Although it is possible to rate up results from randomized controlled trials, GRADE has yet to find a compelling circumstance for doing so (Guyatt et al. 2011). 109 GRADE specifies 3 categories for increasing the quality of evidence (Guyatt et al. 2011) Category 6. Large Magnitude of Effect Possible ratings: 0=no change; +1 or +2 upgrade 1 or 2 levels Modeling studies suggests that confounding (from nonrandom allocation) alone is unlikely to explain associations with a relative risk (RR) greater than 2 (or less than 0.5), and very unlikely to explain associations with an RR greater than 5 (or less than 0.2). Thus, these are the definitions of \"large magnitude of effect\" used by GRADE to upgrade 1 or 2 levels, respectively. Also, GRADE is more likely to rate up if the effect is rapid and out of keeping with prior trajectory; usually supported by indirect evidence. GRADE presents empirical evidence to support these conclusions, and states that \"although further research is warranted, both modeling and empirical work suggest the size of bias from confounding is unpredictable in direction but bounded in size. Hence, the GRADE group has previously suggested guidelines for rating quality of evidence up by one category (typically from low to moderate) for associations greater than 2, and up by two categories for associations greater than 5.\" Applying the GRADE definitions of large magnitude of effect i.e., RR greater than 2 or 5 is problematic in environmental health because for dichotomous outcomes RR is a function of the exposure comparator; these definitions also are not applicable to results from continuous variables. At present, we do not have an empirically defined \"large magnitude of effect.\" Therefore, for the purpose of this case study, coauthors should assess whether the results indicate a large magnitude of effect using their expert judgment of \"large effects\" in environmental health and state their definition for discussion by the group. Rating for Large Magnitude of Effect 0 no change +1 increase quality 1 level +2 increase quality 2 levels Rationale for your judgment Human 110 Category 7. Doseresponse Possible ratings: 0=no change; +1 or +2 upgrade 1 or 2 levels Possible considerations include consistent dose response gradients in one or multiple studies, and/or dose response across studies, depending on the overall relevance to the body of evidence. Rating for DoseResponse 0 no change +1 increase quality 1 level +2 increase quality 2 levels Rationale for your judgment Human Category 8. Confounding Minimizes Effect Possible ratings: 0=no change; +1 or +2 upgrade 1 or 2 levels All plausible residual confounders or biases would reduce a demonstrated effect, or suggest a spurious effect when results show no effect. GRADE provides the following example of grading up evidence when observational studies have failed to demonstrate an association. Observational studies failed to confirm an association between vaccination and autism. This lack of association occurred despite the empirically confirmed bias that parents of autistic children diagnosed after the publicity associated with the article that originally suggested this relationship would be more likely to remember their vaccine experience than parents of children diagnosed before the publicity and presumably, than parents of nonautistic children. The negative findings despite this form of recall bias suggest rating up the quality of evidence. 111Rating for Confounding Minimizes Effect 0 no change +1 increase quality 1 level +2 increase quality 2 levels Rationale for your judgment Human The results of the reviewers' ratings by population will be compiled and discussed leading to a final decision on overall quality of human evidence. The rationale for the decision will be fully documented. 1121. Final decision on overall quality of human evidence: (Example: Moderate quality is upgraded 1 step to high for XYZ reason(s)) High Moderate Low Very B. Rate the Strength of Evidence The evidence quality ratings will be translated into strength of evidence for each population based on a combination of four criteria: (1) Quality of body of evidence; (2) Direction of effect; (3) Confidence in effect; and (4) Other compelling attributes of the data that may influence certainty. The strength of evidence ratings are summarized in Table 1 below, where their meaning is further defined. Table 1. Strength of evidence definitions for human evidence Strength Rating Definition Sufficient evidence of toxicity A positive relationship is observed betw een exposure and outcome where chan ce, bias, and confounding can be ruled out with reasonable confidence. The available eviden ce includes results from one or more well-designed, well- conducted studies, and the conclusion is unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studiesc. Limited Evidence of Toxicity A positive relationship is observed betw een exposure and outcome where chance , bias, and confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence. Confidence in the rela tionship is constrained by such factors as: the number, size, or quality of individual studies, or inc onsistency of findings across individual studiesd. As more information becomes available, the observed effect could change, and th is change may be large enough to alter the conclusion. Inadequate Evidence of Toxicity The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects of the exposure. Ev idence is insufficient because of: the limited number or size of studies, low quality of individua l studies, or inconsistency of findings across individual studies. More information may allow an assessment of effects. c The Navigation Guide rates the quality and strength of evidence of human and non-human evidence streams separately as \"sufficie nt\", \"limited\", \"inadequate\" or \"evidence of lack of toxicity\" and then these two ratings are combined to produce one of five possible statements about the overall strength of the evidence of a chemical's reproductive/developmental toxicity.
