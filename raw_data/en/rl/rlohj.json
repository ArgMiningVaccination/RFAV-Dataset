Traditional approaches to preventing traffickingin human beings, to protect and assist trafficked persons and bring criminals to justicehave had some small impact on the global phenomenon, but not enough. That even oneyoung person be denied the benefits of childhood, that one young woman be subjectedto the brutal humiliation of sexual exploitation and that one man become the slave of acruel taskmaster in another country are clear signals that we must renew both our resolveas well as our initiatives to protect those who are vulnerable. The United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT) was born out of a renewed commitment by world leaders in the battle against human trafficking toend this crime, one of the most egregious violations of human rights in the world today.Formally launched in March 2007 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime(UNODC), and made possible by a generous grant from the United Arab Emirates,UN.GIFT is a call to action, reminding Governments, civil society actors, the media, thebusiness community and concerned individuals of their common commitments to fighttrafficking in persons, and that this battle can not be fought, or won, alone. As at 4December 2007, 116 nations had ratified the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and PunishTrafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, thereby providing a commonframework for international efforts. Only by joining forces, pooling knowledge, expand-ing the scope and number of stakeholders and cooperating across borders can we hopeto eradicate human trafficking. Acknowledging this need at all levels, UNODC continuesIntroduction2to develop UN.GIFT in partnership with the International Labour Organization, the International Organization for Migration, the United Nations Children's Fund, the Officeof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Organization forSecurity and Cooperation in Europe. Why UN.GIFT? UN.GIFT aims to advance action against trafficking in persons on many fronts, and itsobjectives include the following: 1. To raise awareness\u2014to tell the world that human trafficking exists and mobilize people to stop it. 2. To strengthen prevention\u2014to inform vulnerable groups and alleviate the factors that make people vulnerable to trafficking. 3. To reduce demand\u2014to attack the problem at its source by lowering incentives to trade and lowering demand for the products and services of exploited people. 4. To support and protect the victims\u2014to ensure housing, counselling, medical, psycho- logical and material assistance, keeping in mind the special needs of women andchildren and people at risk, such as those in refugee camps and conflict zones. 5. To improve law enforcement effectiveness\u2014to improve information exchange on trafficking routes, trafficker profiles and victim identification in order to dismantlecriminal groups and convict more traffickers. For those convicted, to ensure that thepunishment fits the crime. 6. To implement international commitments\u2014to ensure that international commitments are turned into national laws and practice by targeting technical and legal assistanceto countries in greatest need and improving monitoring of implementation. 7. To enrich the database\u2014to deepen global understanding of the scope and nature of trafficking in persons by more data collection and analysis, better data-sharing, jointresearch initiatives and creating an evidence-based report on global trafficking trends. 8. To strengthen partnership\u2014to build up regional and thematic networks involving civil society, intergovernmental organizations and the private sector. 9. To ensure resources\u2014to attract and leverage resources for the sustainable funding of projects around the world committed to ending human trafficking. 10. To strengthen Member States' participation\u2014to give Member States a strong sense of ownership in the process and create long-term momentum.3The Vienna Forum to Fight Human Trafficking The framework of UN.GIFT has allowed for a global conference, the Vienna Forum to Fight Human Trafficking, to be held in the Austrian capital from 13 to 15 February 2008.The Forum is a unique opportunity to bring together representatives from Member States,United Nations entities, non-governmental and international organizations, the businesscommunity, academia, the public sector and civil society. The Vienna Forum is a visible step towards generating consolidated support and political will behind the goals of the Global Initiative. The aims of the Forum are specifically toraise awareness of all forms of trafficking, to facilitate cooperation and partnerships amongparticipants, to take stock of progress made and to set the directions for follow-up meas-ures to prevent and counter human trafficking. The Forum also provides for an assess-ment of the lessons learned regarding the dimensions of the issue and the current actiontaken in response to trafficking in persons. It allows for an open environment to enableall the parties involved to take practical steps within their spheres of action to fight humantrafficking. Vulnerability, impact and action The Vienna Forum is organized around three central themes, which reflect the key issuesthat need to be addressed in a comprehensive anti-trafficking strategy: Why does humantrafficking occur? What are the consequences? What measures might be taken in response?Within each theme, plenary sessions as well as workshops provide participants with theopportunity to explore each theme in greater detail, with the purpose of developing com-prehensive intervention strategies and undertaking practical action. 1.\u2014Vulnerability: why does human trafficking happen? Human traffickers prey on people who are poor, isolated and weak. Issues such as disempowerment, social exclusion and economic vulnerability are the result of policiesand practices that marginalize entire groups of people and make them particularly vulnerable to being trafficked. Natural disasters, conflict and political turmoil weakenalready tenuous social protection measures. Individuals are vulnerable to being traffickednot only because of conditions in their countries of origin, however. The allure of opportunity, the relentless demand for inexpensive goods and services and the expectation of reliable income drive people into potentially dangerous situations wherethey are at risk of being exploited. The Vienna Forum will examine existing definitionsof and practices related to the prevention of trafficking and, by focusing on decreasingvulnerability, will broaden the strategic impact of existing prevention efforts.42. Impact: the human and social consequences of human trafficking The human and social consequences of trafficking are compelling. From the physical abuse and torture of victims to the psychological and emotional trauma, to the economic andpolitical implications of unabated crime, the impact on individuals and society is clearlydestructive and unacceptable. The Vienna Forum will explore the impact of human trafficking on the lives of individu- als and their communities. Participants will share experiences and focus on the conse-quences of human trafficking to victims, including the violence they experience, theadverse health effects, the social stigmatization and the risk of revictimization. 3. Action: innovative approaches to solving complex problems The Trafficking Protocol provides a comprehensive strategic approach to combating traf- ficking in human beings. Implementation of the measures described in the Protocol,remains uneven however. A lack of clarity related to even basic terms and definitions,national political concerns and uncertainty regarding what measures work and what donot have contributed to a lack of systematic and consistent implementation, and sustain-able action. Participants will be able to review major global anti-trafficking strategies andnational responses, sharing from their own experiences and identifying elements that con-stitute best practices. Background papers In order to provide participants with a common starting point for debate and dialogue,UNODC commissioned the three following background papers, each addressing one ofthe major themes of the conference, and drafted by three leading anti-trafficking experts. The first paper, on vulnerability, challenges current working definitions of prevention and the practical emphasis on public awareness as the primary tool to prevent the occurrenceof this crime. The author maintains that an expanded understanding of prevention toinclude the vulnerability of at-risk individuals and the fostering of an environment wherecrime cannot prosper will assist in the development of comprehensive prevention strategies. The second paper, on the impact of trafficking, outlines the many areas where trafficking affects our lives. The author includes discussions of the consequences of trafficking on5the victims of the crime, as well as on our social, political and economic systems, describ- ing both the reach and the complex and interlocking negative impact that human traffick-ing has at both the national and the global level. The third paper, on action, provides a detailed summary of government responses to traf- ficking since the adoption of the Trafficking Protocol in 2000. The author describes stateactions in the areas of prevention, protection and assistance, and prosecution and lawenforcement, offering a critique of different approaches and a call for an understandingof what constitutes good and best practices. The full papers\u2014reproduced in English only\u2014are preceded by summaries in all six official languages of the United Nations.7Summaries of the papers 1.\u2014Vulnerability Vulnerability, prevention and human trafficking: the need for a new paradigm Current practices in the prevention of trafficking in human beings are analysed in this paper in order to understand why human trafficking continues to be identified as a grow-ing phenomenon. Numerous prevention initiatives and considerable funding notwithstand-ing, a preliminary conclusion is that existing prevention practices do not reflect thecomprehensive approach embodied in definitions of the term \"crime prevention\" in gen-eral or in the illustrative definition of \"prevention\" in article 9 of the Protocol to Prevent,Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplement-ing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. \"Prevention\" as it has been conceptualized in normative frameworks is examined, as also how those frameworks have been narrowly implemented. Vulnerability, in particular thevulnerability of an individual in his or her social context, emerges as the missing link informulating well-developed policies and practices. Focus is placed on what constitutes vul-nerability to trafficking as a prerequisite for the development of valid prevention pro-grammes. New considerations are introduced as regards the development of strategicpolicies to prevent trafficking that are capable of addressing the real problems of vulner-able populations according to their own needs, in their own contexts. The author questions what is meant when experts describe human trafficking as a grow- ing phenomenon, since any assessment of an increase in human trafficking is impossibleto quantify except in general terms. Reasons for this include differences in national defi-nitions of the crime of trafficking, as well as of who constitutes a victim of trafficking,along with a lack of consistent, reliable and comparable data. Both crime prevention and reduction of vulnerability are valid approaches to combating human trafficking. Each calls for different dynamics in policy and programme planning.A focus on vulnerability will enhance the human rights component of trafficking preven-tion policies. Traditional definitions of crime prevention can contribute to the enhance-ment of anti-trafficking policies by focusing on reducing elements of risk in theenvironment. Theoretically, prevention should therefore aim to eliminate trafficking beforeit occurs by reducing the factors that make individuals vulnerable to being trafficked. Basic principles of crime prevention, such as the inclusion of a broad community of stake- holders, the empowerment of vulnerable persons and the reduction of risk factors, areAN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 8intrinsic to the elaboration of what is meant by \"prevention\" given in article 9 of the Trafficking Protocol. Unfortunately, the implementation of those principles has been lim-ited, with the predominant focus having been on the development of both large and smallpublic awareness campaigns directed towards potential victims of trafficking. Such pro-grammes are developed on the premise that increased awareness of possible harm willhelp an individual to choose a different path. However, such programmes fall short becausethey fail to provide potential victims with an alternative course of action. If the emphasisof prevention programmes is placed exclusively on increasing the awareness of potentialvictims, prevention is limited. By failing to provide alternatives, such interventions placethe onus for prevention of exploitation on the individual him- or herself. Potential victims remain equally vulnerable before and after viewing posters, films and televisionadvertisements. The author stresses that successfully assisting vulnerable populations to protect themselves from harm is not possible without an understanding of what makes them vulnerable toviolence, abuse and exploitation in the first place. Reframing the issue of preventionthrough a definition of vulnerability to abuse and exploitation will allow for a more con-sistent approach to preventing trafficking. While the broad concept of prevention existsas part of the normative framework of many countries, viewing prevention models in termsof their relationships to the social, cultural, economic and political vulnerability of certainpopulations or groups to being trafficked has been largely neglected in practice. Although used frequently in anti-trafficking discussions, the terms \"vulnerable\" and \"vul- nerability\" have not been conclusively defined other than in a legal context. This paperincludes an analysis of several considerations in understanding vulnerability and providesa definition in which \"vulnerability\" refers to \"a condition resulting from how individualsnegatively experience the complex interaction of social, cultural, economic, political andenvironmental factors that create the context for their communities\". Based on such considerations, indicators for conditions of vulnerability will need to be developed in the following areas: children; gender; poverty; social and cultural exclusion;limited education; political instability, war and conflict; social, cultural and legal frame-works; movement under duress; and demand. Because most conditions causing vulnerability are systemic and the result of government- enacted policies, it is the responsibility of States to ensure the protection of vulnerableindividuals in their midst. 2.\u2014Impact The impact of trafficking in persons The impact and cost of human trafficking on individuals as well as on political, econo- mic and social systems is described in the paper. Human trafficking is a crime againstSUMMARIES OF THE PAPERS 9individuals and its consequences are most directly felt by those who are its victims. While human trafficking is a global phenomenon that knows no international borders, it is with-in individual countries and societies that its far-reaching and pervasive consequences arefelt. More than 130 countries are affected by human trafficking. Some of the most notablesocial, political and economic impacts of human trafficking are identified, as also impor-tant policy considerations in each of those areas. The consequences of trafficking on individuals Human trafficking has an impact on the individuals it victimizes in all areas of their lives.Every stage of the trafficking process can involve physical, sexual and psychological abuseand violence, deprivation and torture, the forced use of substances, manipulation, eco-nomic exploitation and abusive working and living conditions. Unlike most other violentcrime, trafficking usually involves prolonged and repeated trauma. Documentation andresearch describe how men, women and children are abused in specific exploitative con-ditions and the short- and long-term physical injuries, disabilities and deaths that mayresult. For a number of specified reasons, trafficked persons are at great risk of HIV infec-tion. The trauma experienced by victims of trafficking includes post-traumatic stress dis-order, anxiety, depression, alienation, disorientation, aggression and difficultyconcentrating. Studies indicate that trauma worsens during the trafficking process andmay persist far beyond the end of any exploitation. While subject to the same harmfultreatment as adults, child victims are especially vulnerable to trafficking because of theirage, immaturity and lack of experience, to abusive practices that may, for example, stunttheir further physical development and to continued victimization as a result of attach-ment, developmental and social difficulties. The behaviour of trafficking victims can bedifficult for third parties to understand, while victims can find it difficult to comprehendwhat has happened to them, or to discuss it with or explain it to others. Victims mayappear to those around them, even support persons, to be uncooperative, irritable, hos-tile, aggressive or ungrateful. The stigma attached to them as victims has been shown tohave a significant and ongoing impact on their lives, including in the trauma experiencedby the individual victim as well as the possibility of physical rejection by family and/orcommunity. The long-term consequences of human trafficking for the individual are com-plex and depend on many factors, with no guarantee of recovery. Revictimization is oftena further consequence of the experience. The political implications of trafficking in persons Human trafficking is an issue of major international discussion and concern. Because itinvolves transnational movement of people, one important related area of debate is migra-tion policy. Another concerns human rights aspects. The author describes the complexinterrelationship between policy and action as regards trafficking in persons, smugglingof migrants and migration flows. The relevance of increased border control is noted, asis the status attributed to those who do not enter a State legally. An unintended conse-quence of efforts directed principally at illegal migration can be the non-identification andvictimization of trafficked persons. The specific migration issues faced by countries of AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 10origin and destination that can have a direct impact on trafficking in persons are out- lined, as also the systemic challenges to be met in the case of the identification in oneState of a trafficked person from another State. The economic impact of trafficking in persons The difficulties in assessing the impact of human trafficking are most apparent whenattempting to quantify its economic costs. However, key economic consequences of traf-ficking are described. The costs of the crime of trafficking in persons incorporates manyelements, including the value of all resources devoted to its prevention, the treatment andsupport of victims and the apprehension and prosecution of offenders. These costs maybe offset in part by the recovery of criminal proceeds and assets of the traffickers.Trafficking in persons also results in loss of human resources and reductions in tax rev-enue. Further, trafficking in persons redirects the financial benefits of migration frommigrants, their families, community and government or other potential legitimate employ-ers to traffickers and their associates. All indications are that the income generated byrelated organized crime is significant and global. Given the ongoing nature of exploita-tion, human trafficking generates a stable and regular source of income for criminal net-works, with a consequent impact on other forms of criminal activity as well as legitimatebusiness. Impact on the rule of law As a criminal act, trafficking violates the rule of law, threatening national jurisdictions andinternational law. Organized crime is one of the most important mechanisms for unlaw-ful redistribution of national wealth, unduly influencing markets, political power and soci-etal relations. These effects may be acute in countries responding to civil unrest, naturaldisasters or post-conflict situations. The corresponding challenges faced by Governmentsare in stark contrast to the opportunities created for human traffickers. The underlyingthreat posed by trafficking in persons is why the issue is increasingly recognized as oneof global security. As a complex manifestation of the global economy, organized crime and violations of human rights, human trafficking causes extreme hardship to the suspected millions ofpeople worldwide who have become victims of it and also has an impact on the finan-cial markets, the economies and the social structures of countries where it is allowed toexist. As a major component of organized crime, with all its financial power, traffickingin persons has a complex and interlocking negative impact across human, social, politi-cal and economic spheres. The destabilizing and dangerous consequences of human trafficking range from readily recognized violence, direct economic loss and major migration concerns to the less easilyquantified, equally serious, but more complex effects of risks and harms to environ-mental, social, health and safety, and violations of human rights. Trafficking in personsSUMMARIES OF THE PAPERS 11directly challenges the development of stable, more prosperous societies and legitimate economies, and works strongly against the reconciliation of political interests with human-itarian and human rights obligations. The range of trafficking-related crimes and theirbroad and interrelated impacts have created a cumulative threat to global peace, securityand stability and have shaped political, social and economic responses at both nationaland global levels. 3.\u2014Action Responses to trafficking in persons: international norms translated into action at the national and regional levels The principal responses by Governments to trafficking in persons since the adoption in November 2000 of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons,Especially Women and Children are described in the paper, as also how some of theseresponses could be more effective. The main focus of States has been on detecting andprosecuting traffickers, identifying, protecting and assisting people who have already beentrafficked and initiating action to prevent people from being trafficked in the first place.The need is stressed for more research and data collection on all forms of trafficking inorder to develop tailored and effective anti-trafficking strategies and the subsequent mon-itoring of such interventions in order to make sure they have the desired impact. Legislation Of the 116 States that had ratified the Trafficking Protocol as at 4 December 2007, themajority have adopted new laws or amended existing legislation to translate the Protocolinto action, define an offence of trafficking in persons and increase the penalties for traf-fickers, and have established institutions and procedures to implement the law. Manyregional initiatives have also been implemented. However, in the formulation of these nor-mative frameworks, at both the national and the regional level, there is little consistencyin the core definition of trafficking in persons and national legislation often falls short ofthe comprehensive provisions of the Protocol. States may refer to commercial sexualexploitation, or the trafficking of women and girls, while omitting trafficking for forcedlabour or servitude. In other cases, although the Protocol clearly indicates that in the caseof children the various illegal means of trafficking are irrelevant, some legislation doesnot yet reflect that provision, or defines the age of a child as something other than lessthan 18 years of age. Such lack of definitional clarity poses major challenges for international cooperation. All States that have ratified the Trafficking Protocol should make sure that their legislation isin compliance with its provisions.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 12Working together: coordination and cooperation as essential tools in combating trafficking Collaboration begins at the national level, but is equally important at the bilateral, regio- nal and international levels. At the national level, the presence of institutional structuressuch as national referral mechanisms, national rapporteurs and national coordinators/co-ordinating structures has facilitated concerted action against trafficking. Prosecution and law enforcement activities Notwithstanding significant efforts to identify and care for victims and to detect and pros-ecute traffickers, trafficking in persons is still reported to be one of the most lucrativesectors of transnational organized crime. Confusion between, on the one hand, humantrafficking and, on the other, smuggling or other immigration-related offences has impe-ded progress in law enforcement efforts. The challenges faced in properly identifying avictim of trafficking have highlighted the need for minimum standards concerning theresponse of criminal justice systems. A major challenge for immigration and law enforcement officials is how to distinguish trafficking victims from others they may come into contact with. Significant tensions existbetween initiatives designed primarily to enforce the law against traffickers and thosedesigned to uphold the human rights of trafficked persons. The two approaches are notmutually exclusive, however, and evidence suggests that the prompt identification andappropriate treatment of victims is crucial to an effective law enforcement response. SomeStates have begun to adopt \"reflection periods\" for trafficked persons identified withintheir borders in order to give them time to recover and reflect on whether they are ableand wish to cooperate with law enforcement. A particularly contentious area of debate iswhether the granting of temporary residence permits (separate from reflection period enti-tlements) to victims of trafficking should be conditional upon a trafficked person's co-operation with the criminal justice system. Little priority has so far been given to awardingcompensation or damages to victims of trafficking. Prevention Prevention is inadequately addressed in anti-trafficking strategies, perhaps because ofuncertainty as to the effectiveness of different preventive techniques. A lack of monitor-ing and evaluation of prevention programmes has made it difficult to identify those ini-tiatives which have been successful. Numerous complex factors contribute to traffickingin human beings, including a variety of underlying and root causal factors that influencethe decisions made by individuals that lead to trafficking and that contribute to a socialand economic environment in which trafficking and exploitation can flourish. These fac-tors include economic crisis, social exclusion, gender discrimination and a weak legal orsocial protection system. The remedies for these shortcomings require a broader set ofactions than those designed specifically to stop trafficking.SUMMARIES OF THE PAPERS 13Prevention initiatives in areas of origin have primarily taken the form of information/awareness-raising campaigns alerting people of the dangers involved in seek-ing work abroad, the promotion of income-generating activities, formal and non-formaleducational initiatives and initiatives targeted at groups that are known to be at high riskof being trafficked. Some prevention programmes have taken the form of measures tostrengthen social protection. Although the industrialized States to which people are trafficked have invested money principally in prevention in the countries of origin, they have also begun to make effortswithin their own countries, primarily in the form of revision and comprehensive imple-mentation of immigration and employment policies. Monitoring working conditions,notably in the informal economic sectors, regulating recruitment agencies in sectors wheretrafficking occurs, providing facilities to protect migrants from abusive practices and usinglegislation to address the demand for the labour or services of a trafficked person aresome of the tools States have used to address demand. Countries of destination have alsoimplemented large-scale information campaigns to inform the public about the potentialfor abusive practices in their countries. Protection and assistance International guidelines now clarify the rights of trafficked persons under existing inter-national law, in particular their rights to protection and assistance. Intergovernmental agen-cies and non-governmental organizations have issued a range of good practice guidelinesconcerning assistance and care so that identified trafficked persons can be transferred toa safe place to receive a variety of services, including physical and psychological care,legal assistance, shelter and protection. Significant efforts have also been made to deve-lop standards for the special care of children. The treatment of trafficked persons in countries of exploitation varies widely from coun- try to country. Restrictions on the definition of a trafficking person (women trafficked forcommercial sexual exploitation, for example) can leave other trafficked persons withoutany legal recourse. In many places, trafficked persons remain criminalized for their ille-gal entry into or residence in the countries of transit and destination or for their involve-ment in illicit activities that were a direct consequence of their being trafficked. Theconsequence of inadequate identification procedures usually means that a trafficked per-son will be summarily returned to his or her country of origin without any attention topotential risks at home. Recovery for trafficked persons is a long and complex process. Lessons learned reveal that the conventional assumption that victims should be repatriated and returned to livewith their families is inappropriate and results too easily in victims being returned to asituation where they suffer further harm.14The role of research Research on trafficking in human beings is vital to ensuring adequate prevention, protec- tion and assistance to trafficked persons and the prosecution of criminals. Ongoingresearch is necessary in several key areas, notably on the characteristics of trafficked per-sons and the conditions of vulnerability; on the techniques of the traffickers; on the scopeof the problem, including numbers of trafficked persons; and to monitor, evaluate andassess the impact of prevention and rehabilitation efforts in order to ensure that fundedprogrammes are in fact effective. The author concludes by acknowledging that one of the challenges facing the anti-traffick- ing community today is the abundance of recommendations made to Governments byinternational, regional and specialized advocacy agencies and organizations. A concertedeffort is needed to help States identify and reach agreement on what constitutes \"goodpractice\" in order to ensure that anti-trafficking initiatives become more effective and thatfunds allocated to stopping trafficking are used more effectively.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, L'attention de pr\u00e9vention de la traite. de le de fournissent pas auxvictimes potentielles alternative. focalisent exclusivement sur une meilleure prise de des victimespotentielles, la limit\u00e9e. sur qu'aider vuln\u00e9rables \u00e0 se prot\u00e9ger des dangers n'est possible que si elles comprennent en premier lieu ce qui les rend la violence, aux abus \u00e0 la question traite.

Clark I.\u2014Introduction In the present paper, current practices in the prevention of trafficking in human beings are analysed in order to understand why trafficking continues to be identified as a grow-ing phenomenon. Numerous prevention initiatives and considerable funding notwithstand-ing, a preliminary conclusion is that existing prevention practices do not reflect thecomprehensive approach embodied in definitions of crime prevention in general or in theillustrative definition of \"prevention\" in article 9 of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress andPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the UnitedNations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. 1\"Prevention\" as it has been conceptualized in normative frameworks are examined, as also how those frameworkshave been narrowly implemented. Vulnerability, in particular the vulnerability of an indi-vidual in his or her social context, emerges as the missing link in formulating well-developed policies and practices. Focus is placed on what constitutes vulnerability to trafficking as a prerequisite for the development of valid prevention programmes. Newconsiderations are introduced as regards the development of strategic policies to preventtrafficking that are capable of addressing the real problems of vulnerable populationsaccording to their own needs, in their own contexts. The Trafficking Protocol was adopted in November 2000 and had been ratified by 116 countries as at 4 December 2007. Since the adoption of the Protocol, the internationalcommunity has witnessed an explosion of popular and political interest in combating traf-ficking in human beings, reflected in an influx of funds, widespread awareness-raisingcampaigns, feature films and numerous books, the enactment of anti-trafficking legislationaround the world, law enforcement-centred training and the rapid proliferation of victimsupport services provided by non-governmental, international or regional organizations.These measures are being implemented within the framework established in the TraffickingProtocol, now known as the \"3P\" approach, focusing on the prevention of the crime, theprosecution of offenders and the protection of victims. Several years later, it is now reasonable to ask how far countries have come in prevent- ing trafficking. In areas of prosecution and protection, tangible evidence of new 1General Assembly resolution 55/25, annex II.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 60legislation and a rise in law enforcement activities (police training, arrests, trials, convic- tions and sentences) indicate that efforts have been made. Some victims of trafficking havebeen identified and provided with shelter and/or other forms of assistance. It is more dif-ficult to identify the impact of these efforts: few baseline data exist to provide a contextagainst which to assess progress. In the case of prevention, it is even harder to determinethe extent to which measures have been effective. Despite a lack of consensus on the actual extent of global human trafficking, experts nonetheless report that the crime is increasing. 2Conferences open with energetic state- ments related to the growth of human trafficking, often referred to now as a form of \"modern-day slavery\". Poignant illustrative examples describing heart-wrenching abuse and exploitation are intended to reinforce the commitments of Governments, civil societyand donors. Those who have had direct contact with trafficked persons readily validate such accounts of human suffering. 3Many advocates hold on to vivid memories of emotionally wounded and physically beaten human beings as indelible reminders of the reality of the cause andas powerful incentives to continue fighting the good fight. But the battle must be won notonly in the hearts of the public, but also in the minds of policymakers and donors. Effective policy requires valid and reliable information. Experts have so far been hard pressed to explain what an increase in human trafficking means in real terms. 4Are they referring to more arrests, prosecutions and (with luck) convictions? Do they include allforms of trafficking, such as labour and organ trafficking to name only two, or are theylimiting themselves to trafficking for sexual exploitation? Are the speakers perhaps talk-ing about the numbers of men, women and children rescued in brothel and/or sweatshopraids? Perhaps they mean individuals in possession of fraudulent travel documents ordeported as illegal migrants? Or the numbers of individuals identified as victims of traf-ficking according to the laws and (most frequently) practices of a country and assistedthrough shelters or other social service organizations? And what about the rapidly expand-ing forms of trafficking beyond the purposes described in the Trafficking Protocol, stem-ming in particular from innovations in medical technology and not yet known when theTrafficking Protocol was being drafted? 5 Such indicators and others are used to demonstrate the increase in trafficking and traf-ficking-related crimes. And, while the above information collectively paints a picture of 2See, for example, Kevin Bales, Understanding Global Slavery: a Reader (Berkeley, California, University of California Press, 2005). 3The author includes herself in this category. 4William Easterly, \"Foreign aid and developing economies\", transcript of a panel discussion, Council on Foreign Relations, New York, 16 May 2006. 5An example of a disturbing new trend is the harvesting and trafficking of human eggs to be used in in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments. The documentation has been limited to date, but is of such a provocative nature thatthe European Union has issued the \"European Parliament resolution on the trade in human egg cells\", Official Journal of the European Union , C 320 E, 15 December 2005 (P6_TA(2005)0074).PART ONE. \u2014VULNERABILITY 61widespread human misery, there are limitations to speaking in such broad terms. A closer examination of numerous reports reveals little consistency on even some of the most basicterminology. There is no consensus on the definition of the term \"victim of trafficking\",although the Trafficking Protocol acknowledges the trafficked person as victim. TheProtocol itself does not define the term, although it contains numerous references to vic-tims of trafficking. Some countries have criminalized trafficking for sexual exploitation butnot for labour. There is not always consensus on what \"sexual exploitation\" means, noris there any broadly accepted tool for the identification of victims. A recent report citesdifferences in definitions of who is a victim of trafficking, the nature of the term itselfand social practices that may contribute to trafficking as challenges in reaching interna-tional consensus. 6The same report also indicates that such definitional inconsistencies, combined with a lack of reliable, consistent and comparable data, make any assessmentof a rise or fall in human trafficking impossible to quantify except in general terms. 7 Unsubstantiated claims of an increase in trafficking offer little guidance to policymakers,practitioners or donors seeking to introduce effective anti-trafficking measures. The anti-trafficking community, however, is not alone in attempting to solve a problem for whichthere are no clear-cut parameters. An analysis of the implementation of the MillenniumDevelopment Goals, 8accepted now as criteria by which to measure international devel- opment efforts, reveals that challenges in achieving some of their objectives stem from alack of documentation and, consequently, an inability to determine clear-cut objectives. Arecent report on the challenges of meeting the Goals indicates: \"Only 57 out of 163 developing countries have counted the poor more than once since 1990. Ninety-two have not counted them at all.\" 9 The same challenges are present in quantifying the effects of certain disease preventionprogrammes or infant and child mortality. Current statistics are based on estimates, mak-ing any assessment of progress extremely difficult. While each of the terms \"prevention\", \"protection\" and \"prosecution\" can benefit from fur- ther definitional clarity, this paper will discuss the limitations to achieving progress incombating human trafficking by relying on narrow definitions and interpretations of whatconstitutes prevention. 6United States of America, Government Accountability Office, Human Trafficking: Monitoring and Evaluation of International Projects are Limited, but Experts Suggest Improvements , GAO report GAO-07-1034 (Washington, D.C., July 2007), p. 13. 7Ibid., p. 16. 8See A/56/326, annex, and A/58/323, annex. 9\"Millennium Development Goals: the Eight Commandments\", The Economist , 5 July 2007.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 62II.\u2014The current framework for prevention of trafficking The term \"prevention\" is defined by illustration in the Trafficking Protocol. Such a definition has enabled it to acquire meaning primarily through practice rather than policy. While recognized as a critical issue in combating trafficking, little clarity exists as to what constitutes comprehensive preventive measures. Notably, national anti-trafficking policiesor national action plans, where they exist, acknowledge the importance of prevention inan overall national strategy, but seldom define the term. A recent study on measures to combat trafficking among member States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) 10indicates a high level of importance attached to furthering prevention efforts, but also reveals a diversity of perspectives on the nature of prevention itself. Member States identified the need for prevention-related activities encompassing three broad areas. The first is preventionthrough public awareness and education, reflecting a need to inform the public, includingindividuals who are potentially at risk, of the dangers of being trafficked. The second isprevention through data collection and research in order to understand both the scopeas well as the nature of trafficking in those countries. The third form of prevention citedby OSCE member States involves the development of social and economic interventionsrelated to human trafficking, reflecting the need to generate alternatives for those potentially at risk of being trafficked. All three areas are necessary to the development ofcomprehensive prevention activities and all are described in the OSCE Action Plan toCombat Trafficking in Human Beings. Notwithstanding identified needs as well as a clearnormative framework, the study also shows that the most frequently implemented prevention programmes in countries with an OSCE field presence belong to the first category. Certainly, some prevention programmes corresponding to the second and thirdcategories mentioned above are being implemented by international organizations, civilsociety groups and government agencies, but they are not the majority. Is this emphasis on public awareness and education sufficient? Can the reported increases in trafficking referred to at the beginning of this paper possibly be linked to limited prevention efforts? In order to answer these questions honestly, it is necessary to under-stand the meaning of prevention in the context of human trafficking. Firstly, practitionersneed to be clear as to what they are trying to prevent. An initial response stems from thecontext of the Trafficking Protocol itself, which states in its preamble that preventing trafficking involves preventing a crime. This response is further clarified in the definitionof the term \"trafficking in persons\", found in article 3 of the Protocol, describing the variousacts, means and purposes of trafficking. Of particular interest here is the inclusion, as ameans of trafficking, of the \"abuse of ... a position of vulnerability\". In identifying the abuseof a position of vulnerability as part of the definition, the Protocol allows us to considerthat prevention includes both preventing a crime and reducing the conditions that makean individual vulnerable to trafficking. 10Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Office of the Special Representative and Coordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, From Policy to Practice: Combating Trafficking in Human Beings in the OSCE Region, 2006 annual report submitted by the Anti-Trafficking Assistance Unit (OSCE, 2006).PART ONE. \u2014VULNERABILITY 63Both crime prevention and reduction of vulnerability are valid approaches. Each calls for different dynamics in policy and programme planning. They involve different actors, includ-ing at-risk individuals themselves, civil society and government agencies. Neither approachdiminishes the reality that, in addition to being a crime, trafficking in persons is also anabuse of human rights. A focus on vulnerability will in fact enhance the human rightscomponent of any anti-trafficking policy. Indeed, the two different approaches are com-plementary, as an examination of various definitions of crime prevention will show. Traditional definitions of crime prevention can contribute to the enhancement of anti- trafficking prevention policies, because they provide for a broad inclusion of actors, theempowerment of individuals and the reduction of risk factors in the environment. Onedefinition of \"crime prevention\" is \"the anticipation, recognition and appraisal of a crimerisk, and the initiation of action to remove or reduce it\". 11A further definition is \"the pro- motion of those attitudes, activities and behaviours that create and maintain safe and vitalcommunities where crime and delinquency cannot flourish\". 12And a third indicates:13 \"Crime prevention is any initiative or policy which reduces, avoids or eliminates victimization by crime or violence. It includes government and non-government initiatives to reduce fear of crime as well as lessen the impact of crime on victims.\" Studies of efforts to prevent domestic violence can be particularly helpful to anti-trafficking efforts, especially in understanding and applying the principles of inclusion, empower-ment and risk reduction. Recognizing that research efforts in this area are still quite new,experts acknowledge the complexity of preventing domestic violence and the difficulty ofmaking choices in focus and concentration. It has been said that prevention action mustchoose between two approaches ... one is directed at the social environment, the other atthe individual. In domestic violence, as in human trafficking, the challenge is whetherone should focus on empowering potential victims or on changing the structures thatencourage violence, abuse and exploitation. What it means to empower potential victims will form the basis for the next section of this paper. Theoretically, prevention efforts should aim to eliminate acts of violence before they occur. In the prevention of infectious diseases or environmental disasters, where cause and effectcan more readily be identified, it is relatively commonplace to inoculate against an infec-tion or to shore up a weak levy against threat of flood. Such primary prevention effortsbecome more complex when talking about human behaviour: it is not always possible todetermine conclusively that any single adverse behaviour will result in specific negativeconsequences, nor is it possible to claim that any single preventive measure will conclu-sively reduce the risk of harm or abuse. In domestic violence, as in human trafficking, itis difficult to identify projects and programmes that will eliminate such abuse before the 11Timothy D. Crowe, Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (Stoneham, Massachusetts, Butterworth- Heineman, 1991), p. 23 (see www.jus.state.nc.us). 12American Probation and Parole Association (see www.appa-net.org/about/ps/crimeprevention). 13\"What is crime prevention,\" article available on the website of the University of Ottawa, Faculty of Social Sciences, Institute for the Prevention of Crime (see http://www.socialsciences.uottawa.ca/ipc/eng/what_is_crime_prevention.asp).AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 64fact. In the realm of trafficking prevention, it would appear that it is easier to obtain fund- ing for awareness-raising programmes that describe the potential harms than for generalempowerment programmes directed at broader social problems such as illiteracy, poorstandards of health or under- or unemployment. This attitude towards funding is premisedmore on assumption than fact, for it has so far not been proved that either the former orthe latter are more or less effective in preventing trafficking. Currently, there is little knowledge or understanding of the causes of human trafficking, although there is extensive descriptive work on the process of trafficking itself. Becauseit is difficult to identify causal relationships, most prevention programmes limit themselvesto describing the harmful aspects of trafficking as a means of preventing harm. Preventionprogrammes do make efforts to prevent subsequent acts of revictimization. 14Thus, many programmes are directed at assisting returning trafficked persons in their countries of ori-gin through counselling, training and job placement. A comprehensive discussion of prevention must also recognize the dynamic nature of the trafficking process along a supply-demand continuum. Such an approach has traditiona-lly included countries of origin, destination and transit, but does not provide for internaltrafficking, which can occur within a single country (from rural regions to urban centres,for example). Any discussion of prevention should focus on developing measures thatconsider both the supply and the demand components. The acts of trafficking are differ-ent along the continuum, from recruitment to exploitation to return and possible revic-timization. Trafficked persons are also vulnerable in different ways along the continuumand different measures to prevent both trafficking and revictimization are necessary.Countries of destination, which drive the demand for human trafficking, must increasinglyrecognize their role in preventing exploitation and abuse and must include both the con-sumers of commercial sex as well as the employers of individuals trafficked for forcedand exploitative labour. A study of the literature on risks and vulnerabilities of refugeesand displaced persons is particularly useful in the development of such a dynamic frame-work. 15 The Trafficking Protocol and prevention For some, the discussion above might appear to be yet one more layer of criteria to includein the development of prevention policies, perhaps even the basis for a subsequent adden-dum to or enhancement of local or regional action plans. However, this is not necessary.Basic principles of crime prevention such as inclusion, empowerment and risk reductionare intrinsic to the Trafficking Protocol's elaboration of what is meant by \"prevention\" inarticle 9, which recommends action for States parties in areas of prevention. The Protocolmaintains that it is the State that drives change, with the support and assistance of civilsociety, and that, through its various social protection and law enforcement policies, theState can play a role in both the prevention of criminal activity and the empowerment ofvulnerable populations. 14Women Against Violence Europe, Prevention of Domestic Violence Against Women: European Survey, Good Practice Models, WAVE Training Programme (Vienna, WAVE Office, Austrian Women's Shelter Network, 2000). 15See, for example, Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, Displaced Women and Girls at Risk: Risk Factors, Protection Solutions and Resource Tools (New York, February 2006).PART ONE. \u2014VULNERABILITY 65The table below identifies actions recommended in article 9 of the Trafficking Protocol for State parties to take in order to prevent trafficking.

States parties shall adopt or strengthen Insufficient educational, social or cultural legislative or other measures, such as measures to discourage demand.educational, social or cultural measures, including through bilateral or multilateral cooperation, to discourage the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation of persons, especially women and children, that leads to trafficking.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 66Do prevention programmes as currently implemented address all the potential areas of vulnerability addressed in the Trafficking Protocol? If so, have they been effective? It is hardto answer these questions because the evaluation of trafficking prevention programmes ingeneral remains limited. 16Furthermore, most programmes focus on trafficking for sexual exploitation despite the growing recognition of trafficking for forced and bonded labour,among others. 17One measure of effectiveness is that laws have been enacted. In some cases, perpetrators have been brought to justice. Most importantly, some individuals have beenhelped. However, it is not possible to say with certainty that fewer vulnerable individuals arebeing trafficked. Although broad categories of prevention programmes include awareness-raising and education, employment, empowerment and community life, crisis prevention, safe migra- tion and job-vetting activities, demand reduction and policies and legislation regarding prevention, 17in practice these activities tend to be focused on the development of small- and large-scale public awareness campaigns directed at potential victims of trafficking.18 Awareness-raising activities have predominantly taken the form of large- and small-scalepublic education and awareness campaigns, usually aimed at individuals/social groups considered to be at risk of being trafficked. There has also been a recent increase in awareness campaigns directed at men, the clients of women trafficked for prostitution. Forinitiatives funded by the United States Government, assistance is generally aimed toenhance efforts to prevent human trafficking through public awareness, outreach, education efforts and advocacy campaigns. 19 Public awareness campaigns are developed on the premise that increased awareness of poten-tial harm will help an individual to choose an alternative course of action. Although effortsto evaluate such programmes indicate that target audiences report an increase in knowledge,no studies have shown that they actually influence choices, in large part because they arenot able to provide potential trafficked persons with viable alternatives. A telling illustrationof this was provided by an NGO outreach worker in a large Western European city, whoasked several trafficked youth whether or not they had been warned about the dangers ofaccepting foreign job offers. One young person responded, \"Yes, but the nightmare I don'tknow is preferable to the nightmare I live every day at home.\" 20 16The challenges of evaluating anti-trafficking programmes are documented in numerous reports and studies (see Ruth Rosenberg and others, Best Practices for Programming to Prevent Trafficking in Human Beings in Europe and Eurasia (Bethesda, Maryland, Development Alternatives Inc., 2004) and Asia Foundation and Horizons Project PopulationCouncil, Prevention of Trafficking and the Care and Support of Trafficked Persons: in the Context of an Emerging HIV/AIDS Epidemic in Nepal (Kathmandu, Creative Press, February 2001)). 17Rosenberg and others, op. cit., p. 2. 18Discussions of the prevalence of awareness-raising campaigns within the broader context of prevention can be found in numerous sources (see Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Office of the SpecialRepresentative and Coordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, From Policy to Practice ... and Rosenbergand others, op. cit.). 19United States of America, Government Accountability Office, Human Trafficking: Monitoring ..., p. 7. 20Author's notes.PART ONE. \u2014VULNERABILITY 67If the emphasis of prevention programmes is placed exclusively on increasing the awareness of potential victims, prevention is limited. By failing to provide alternative courses of action, these interventions place the onus for prevention of exploitation uponthe individual him- or herself. Ultimately, potential victims remain equally vulnerable beforeand after viewing posters, films and television advertisements and participating in educational programmes. III.\u2014The purpose of a discussion on vulnerability It is not possible to be successful in assisting vulnerable populations to protect themselves from potentially harmful situations without an understanding of what makes them vulner-able to violence, abuse and exploitation in the first place. 21Consistent with the interna- tional framework for combating trafficking in persons created by the Trafficking Protocol,the mission statement of the Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking includes, as oneof its goals, to strengthen prevention, warn vulnerable groups and alleviate the factors thatmake people vulnerable to trafficking such as poverty, underdevelopment and lack ofopportunity. 22The organizers of the Vienna Forum to Fight Human Trafficking recognized that prevention is to be considered largely as a function of the reduction of vulnerabilityand the provision of options to actions with otherwise potentially harmful consequences.By focusing on vulnerability, the planners of the Forum hoped to expand the discussionon prevention through the identification of factors that create conditions of vulnerabilityand the subsequent development of targeted strategies to alleviate many of those conditions. Reframing the issue of prevention in relation to a definition of vulnerability to abuse and exploitation will allow for a more consistent and measurable approach to the preventionof trafficking. The clarification of what is meant by \"vulnerability\" will also help to iden-tify causal factors, usually the direct result of policy decisions, which increase vulnerabil-ity. While the concept of prevention remains part of the normative framework of manycountries, viewing prevention models largely in terms of their relationship to the social,cultural, economic and political vulnerability of certain population groups to being traf-ficked has mainly been neglected in practice. 21See, for example, the Asia Foundation and Horizons Project Population Council, Prevention of Trafficking ... . 22Website of the Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN.GIFT): www.UNGIFT.org.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 68IV.\u2014Vulnerability: a definition The terms \"vulnerable\" and \"vulnerability\" are used in areas of economic development, social science, human security, crime prevention, environmental research, disaster relief,famine, contagious diseases and mental health. Each of these areas has carefully devel-oped frameworks that serve as road maps for early warning systems as well as carefullycrafted countermeasures. The increased focus on vulnerability leads to measures that canbe implemented before the occurrence of a potential danger, trauma or abuse, therebylessening its human, economic and social consequences. Thus, an understanding of vul-nerability implicitly leads towards prevention. A.\u2014Vulnerability and human trafficking There is no broadly accepted definition of the terms \"vulnerable\" and \"vulnerability\" in relation to prevention of trafficking. One definition of the term \"vulnerable\" is \"exposedto the possibility of being attacked or harmed, either physically or emotionally\". 23In much of the literature on trafficking, the terms \"vulnerable\" and \"poor\" have been used synony-mously, and poverty is often cited as a leading cause of trafficking. Vulnerability, how-ever, is not the same as income-poverty or poverty even more broadly defined. In thedevelopment literature, for example, vulnerability does not refer to lack or want, but ratherto exposure and defencelessness. 24Vulnerability refers to the condition of a person in a specific context. A response to vulnerability needs therefore to take into account24the external conditions of an individual as well as the coping mechanisms that enable theindividual to protect him- or herself against a negative impact from those external conditions. The terms are more precisely understood in law, where the term \"vulnerable victim\" is used to refer to \"a victim who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental con-dition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to criminal conduct\". 25The concept of vulnerability is also used to enhance penalties in cases of trafficking.26 The words occur three times in the Trafficking Protocol. The first is in the preamble, whichincludes the paragraph: \"Concerned that, in the absence of such an instrument, persons who are vulnerable to trafficking will not be sufficiently protected\". The second mention of the term occurs in the definition of \"trafficking\" (art. 3, subpara. (a)): 23Judy Pearsall and Patrick Hanks, eds., New Oxford Dictionary of English (Oxford University Press, 2001). 24Robert Chambers, \"Poverty and livelihoods: whose reality counts?\", Environment and Urbanization , vol. 7, No. 1 (1995), p. 189. 25Mohamed Y. Mattar, \"Incorporating the five basic elements of a model anti-trafficking in persons legislation in domestic laws: from the United Nations Protocol to the European Convention\", Tulane Journal of International and Comparative Law , vol. 14, No. 2 (2005), p. 385. 26Ibid., p. 387.PART ONE. \u2014VULNERABILITY 69\"'Trafficking in persons' shall mean the recruitment, transportation, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits toachieve the consent of a person having control for another person, for the purposeof exploitation.\" The last reference (art. 9, para. 4) has already been cited: \"States Parties shall take or strengthen measures, including through bilateral or multi- lateral cooperation, to alleviate the factors that make persons, especially women andchildren, vulnerable to trafficking.\" The travaux pr\u00e9paratoires to the Trafficking Protocol also indicate that the reference to the abuse of a position of vulnerability is understood to refer to any situation in whichthe person involved has no real and acceptable alternative but to submit to the abuseinvolved. 27On the basis of this note, it is possible to state that the individuals most vul- nerable to harm are those with the fewest alternatives. With the knowledge that crime isincreasing in a given neighbourhood, residents with means can choose to leave, to putprotective bars on windows and doors and/or to lobby their local representatives aggres-sively to ensure a more visible law enforcement presence. Where there is a strong employ-ment market and numerous jobs, individuals are able to remain in their home countriesrather than pursue foreign employment opportunities that might turn out to be exploita-tive. The core of trafficking prevention activities should therefore be the provision of alter-natives to the individuals who are most vulnerable. When confronted with a potentiallyexploitative situation, they should be able to know that they have choices. Based on the above analysis, a new definition of vulnerability will now be introduced, in which \"vulnerability\" refers to \"a condition resulting from how individuals negatively expe-rience the complex interaction of social, cultural, economic, political and environmentalfactors that create the context for their communities\". As such, vulnerability is not a static,absolute state, but one that changes according to context as well as to the capacity forindividual response. The development of indicators requires careful attention to the uniquecharacteristic of the group being assessed in order to develop the most effective preven-tive solutions and should allow for the development of goals and strategies to ensurereduction of vulnerability. Specific indicators will make it possible to set tangible goals forthe reduction of vulnerability. Conditions of vulnerability can be very real, such as illhealth or illiteracy; equally important, however, are those areas of vulnerability which arenot clearly demonstrable, difficult to identify and consequently difficult to address. 27See the note on article 3, subparagraph (a), of the Trafficking Protocol in the travaux pr\u00e9paratoires (A/55/383/Add.1, para. 63).AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, AND ACTION 70How can the anti-trafficking community prevent Jana, and other young women like her, from being trafficked? What are those programmes that will work? Prevention programmesdesigned to increase Jana's awareness of the potential trafficking situations will fail her.Her personal situation has provided her with sufficient knowledge and experience of therisks involved in seeking overseas employment. Only prevention programmes that areinclusive of members of her community, that reduce the potential for harm in her country and that empower her to make choices by providing her with viable alternativeswill contribute to preventing harm.Illustration The true story below will help to illustrate the complexity of identifying vulnerability. The poignancy of the situation will also demonstrate the fallacy of simple solutions and the needfor long-term answers that empower individuals and provide them with opportunities. Jana, 18, is from a country in Eastern Europe known to be a major source for trafficked women. She has just completed secondary school and works in a confectionery factory. Herolder sister, Lydia, was trafficked two years ago. After being arrested in a brothel raid, Lydiaagreed to testify against her traffickers and was given temporary residence for the durationof the trial. Although her testimony contributed to the prosecution's obtaining a convictionand a sentence, Lydia was told she needed to go home. Rather than face the shame andstigma of returning as a criminal and a prostitute, she hanged herself. Now her four-year-old daughter lives at home with Lydia's mother, who also works in a confectionery factory,and Jana. The father is a migrant labourer and is often away from home for long periods oftime. Extensive conversations with the family revealed feelings of deep shame about what had happened to Lydia. Her pictures had been removed from the house and her name was notmentioned. Jana admitted that, while being afraid of what could happen to her, she stillwanted to work overseas because there was nothing for her at home, other than to stayin the confectionery factory and \"marry a worthless alcoholic like my sister did\". A smallfoundation offered to pay for Jana's university education over four years, including a subsidy to make up for lost wages as well as all books and fees. Although definitely brightenough, Jana declined the offer, saying that she did not know anyone who had gone to theuniversity and she didn't think it was her place. She asked, instead, to be sent to a vocational programme to study hairdressing, following the example of many of her friends. 28 Jana is a potential victim of trafficking. She is vulnerable because she faces limited employmentopportunities in a country with a volatile economy and a limited job market. She is also vulnerable because she feels no support to pursue a university education, because of theexpectations of her community that overseas jobs are the only option and because she cansee little opportunity for either personal or professional fulfilment at home. 28Author's files.PART ONE. \u2014VULNERABILITY 71Conditions of vulnerability are usually the results of political, social, cultural or economic practices and policies that fail to ensure equal access and protection to all members of asociety. Any prevention programme that is based on an understanding of vulnerabilitywill therefore include two components: one will address the external conditions that cre-ate hardship and stress and that will contribute to enhancing the well-being of an individ-ual; the second, equally important approach will focus on enhancing an individual'scapacity to seek options, enabling the individual to participate in ensuring his or her well-being. 29Such a perspective takes into account the different components of empowerment and risk reduction that were identified in the previous discussion on definitions of crimeprevention. There is still no agreement on the conditions that lead to vulnerability to human traffick- ing. A review of reports, however, reveals a general consensus on the broad factors thatmake individuals vulnerable. Further research is necessary in order to expand on thesedefinitions and to highlight factors that are specific to different geographical regions, eth-nic groups and political situations. Conflict, for example, creates a unique set of vulnera-bility factors that must be addressed in any discussion on the prevention of humantrafficking. B.\u2014Conditions of vulnerability The preceding discussion becomes relevant in the identification of broad conditions of vulnerability in order to formulate indicators that take into account multiple social, cul-tural, political and economic contexts. The following is a list of \"conditions\" or factors affecting vulnerability that have been extracted from numerous publications addressing the root causes of trafficking. The listis not intended to be conclusive, but to serve as a starting point for further discussion.These conditions are described here only in general terms. The development of specificindicators to identify how individuals are vulnerable in particular situations or contextswould provide the basis for specific and strategic interventions. For example, not all youngwomen from a single region are trafficked for purposes of sexual exploitation. By identi-fying particular vulnerabilities, a framework such as this can assist in the development ofprevention programmes targeted at those who are in fact most vulnerable. 1.\u2014Children In the context of trafficking, children should not be treated merely as small adults: they are uniquely vulnerable in ways that differ from the vulnerability of adults. They are vul-nerable to the demands and expectations of those in authority, including their parents,extended family and teachers. Physically, they are not able to protect themselves. They 28Of importance to the development of these ideas has been Amartya Sen's discussion on the role of individ- ual agency in development programmes (see, for example, Amartya Sen, Development as Freedom (New York, Knopf, 1999), chap. X).AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 72are usually unaware of any laws that may exist to protect them and they are unable to negotiate fair treatment for themselves. When rescued from a trafficking situation, children are not always able to articulate the nature of their experiences in a way thatcorresponds to protocols used to identify adult victims of trafficking. They are also physically vulnerable in harsh environmental conditions. 2.\u2014Gender Women are vulnerable to trafficking because they are frequently excluded from main- stream economic and social systems, such as employment, higher education, and legal aswell as political parity. They are often the hidden victims of war and conflict, and this vulnerability extends to their status as displaced persons or refugees. It is also arguablyexacerbated by their \"relatively unequal\" (secondary) status in the family and society moregenerally. 30Women are vulnerable to rape, domestic violence, harmful traditional practices, trafficking and lack of or limited access to resources. Many of these gender-based conditions of vulnerability are linked to social and cultural conditions.31 3.\u2014Poverty \"Poverty\" is a complex term that refers to numerous negative conditions, including a lack of food and productive resources; hunger and malnutrition; ill health; limited or no accessto education and other basic services; increasing mortality and morbidity from illness;homelessness and inadequate housing; unsafe environments; social discrimination andexclusion; and lack of participation in the decision-making process. Generalizations aboutpoverty, without identifying its components, make it difficult to identify responsibility and,consequently, solutions. Poverty is created by policies and preserved through structuresthat reinforce these same policies. 32For this reason, it is counterproductive to say that poverty is a cause of trafficking without defining the term. Furthermore, it is not neces-sarily the poorest of the poor who become victims of exploitation leading to trafficking,although victims of labour exploitation, notably in developing nations, are poor. 33 According to Bales:34 \"The ill, the elderly, the malnourished, the disabled and the infirm are not soughtout by traffickers. They are human commodities of insufficient value to bring highprofits.\" Clearly, a more sophisticated understanding of the relationship of poverty to the risk of being trafficked is necessary. 30The Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences has recently observed that while the failure of the States to protect and promote women's human, economic and social rights has created a situation in which trafficking flourishes, trafficking further subjects women to numerous additional human rights violations. 31Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, Displaced Women and Girls ... . 32Muhammad Yunus and Alan Jolis, Banker to the Poor: Micro-Lending and the Battle against World Poverty (New York, Public Affairs, 2003). 33International Labour Office, A Global Alliance against Forced Labour: Global Report under the Follow-up to the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (Geneva, International Labour Office, 2005). 34Bales, op. cit., p. 141.PART ONE. \u2014VULNERABILITY 73The effects of globalization have also introduced new variables into traditional discussions of poverty. A World Bank analysis of the social consequences of the economic collapseof countries of the former Soviet Union reveals what the study identifies as \"new poverty\",the result of structural adjustments and political decisions that have destabilized theeconomies of these emerging States and plunged entire sectors of the population into sit-uations that in fact constitute a new form of poverty among people who had never thoughtof themselves as poor. 35This form of crisis-driven poverty has contributed to a feeling of hopelessness among many of the population. Their sense of despair, coupled with a senseof panic at finding themselves suddenly without any traditional social protection mecha-nisms to assist their families, was a motivation behind many young women seeking employ-ment outside their countries of origin, leading to extreme forms of exploitation, abuse andtrafficking. Ascribing trafficking to poverty in general terms in such situations fails to rec-ognize the complexity of cause as well as motivation and leads to inadequate preventionprogrammes. 4.\u2014Social and cultural exclusion In every country, certain groups benefit from privileges and access to resources and polit- ical power that inure them to the potential hazards of economic downturns, political insta-bility or natural disasters. Those who do not fall into the \"preferred\" category sufferdiscrimination in education, employment, access to social services, including health care,access to resources (especially in times of natural disaster) and lack of a political voice.Socially excluded groups are cultural subgroups who are marginalized according to complex factors, including ethnic, linguistic and religious differences, low social status andinvoluntary minority status. Social exclusion prevents groups from receiving benefits andprotections that are intended for all citizens. Their economic mobility is usually affectedand they are excluded from mainstream activities such as education and employment. 36 Social exclusion can be the result of state policies as well as ingrained cultural traditionsand practices. In developing such prevention programmes, it is important to understandwhere changes need to be made. Social exclusion is particularly important when discussing how to prevent revictimization and re-trafficking. Trafficked persons face considerable obstacles upon their return home,not the least of which are the attitudes and biases of their own communities. Young womentrafficked for purposes of sexual exploitation may encounter discrimination based on theirinvolvement in prostitution. Others face the shame and humiliation of returning pennilessin spite of hopes of coming back with provision for their families. And, frequently, thesesame persons return with the added black mark of having been arrested as \"illegal immi-grants\", notwithstanding their true status as victims of crime. 35Nora Dudwick and others, eds., When Things Fall Apart: Qualitative Studies of Poverty in the Former Soviet Union (Washington, D.C., World Bank, 2003). 36Maureen A.

In addition, theywill not have the knowledge or confidence to inquire about the terms of their contractsor working conditions. Limited access can be determined by gender, social customs, econo-mic capacity, limited access to educational institutions and the cultural relevance of gettingan education. Once again, tangible as well as intangible factors contribute to limited accessto education, including community attitudes to education, the need for children to earnan income and lack of gender-appropriate teachers or relevant curriculum. 6.\u2014Political instability, war and conflict Women and girls are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of political instability and armed conflict. The disruption of traditional community life, along with its protectiveframework, and the resulting displacement make them extremely vulnerable to exploita-tion, including abuse of power by relief workers, limited access to resources and sexualassault. 37 7.\u2014Social, cultural and legal frameworks The status of an individual within his or her environment, whether that status is defined through formal systems (such as a legal system) or informal systems, creates different levels of vulnerability. A telling example of this is the emerging importance accorded tobirth registration as a long-term anti-trafficking strategy in some parts of the world. 38Some factors that could be considered in such a discussion include discriminatory labour practices; patriarchal social structures; women's role in the family; precedents of bondedlabour and servitude; and early and forced marriage. Social and cultural frameworks areparticularly sensitive to context and must therefore be considered with special caution soas to avoid making harmful generalities. One particularly perceptive study on HIV/AIDSprevention describes the extent to which values related to having large families and disapproval of use of any form of contraceptive are so imbedded in some communitiesthat they override any efforts to teach women to use condoms in order to protect themselves against possibly infected partners. 39 37Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children, Displaced Women and Girls ... . 38Vital Voices Global Partnership, Stateless and Vulnerable to Human Trafficking in Thailand, (Washington, D.C., June 2007), p. 13 (see www.vitalvoices.org). 39Desmond Cohen and Elizabeth Reid, \"The Vulnerability of Women: Is this a Useful Construct for Policy and Programming?\", Issues paper No. 28, HIV and Development Programme (New York, United Nations DevelopmentProgramme, 1996).PART ONE. \u2014VULNERABILITY 758.\u2014Movement Movement under duress exacerbates existing vulnerabilities and creates new conditions under which individuals are made vulnerable to exploitation and trafficking. Refugees,internally displaced persons and asylum seekers, who find themselves in highly volatilesituations and without traditional protection mechanisms, are extremely vulnerable.Outreach workers in a large Central European city encountered numerous young foreignprostituted women in the city's red light district, who upon investigation proved all tohave been approached by the same agency in their home country offering to assist themin obtaining asylum. Having successfully facilitated their receipt of asylum status, theagency then forced the women to reimburse it by the provision of sexual services. In theunnatural and often violent conditions pertaining in camps and asylum centres for refugeesand internally displaced persons, the need for individuals to obtain and/or provide foodand other necessities for dependants is constant and has reportedly been exploited.Consequently, women and children, in particular, find themselves in situations where theymust exchange sexual services for food or other survival-related necessities. 9.\u2014Demand The conditions listed above are found primarily in countries or regions of origin, where most prevention programmes are implemented. A discussion of vulnerability is not com-plete, however, without a recognition that trafficking is driven in large part by the profitsmade by various actors along the trafficking chain resulting from the exploitation of men,women and children. Such profits are realized because of the unabated demand for cheaplabour and services mainly in the developed world, usually in construction, seasonal agri-culture work, the garment and hospitality sectors, domestic service and the ubiquitouscommercial sex trade. 40 Demand provides the incentive to recruiters, who capitalize on misery, despair and des-peration. Once an individual is transported to the site of exploitation, that person becomesvulnerable in ways different from those in their countries of origin. Lack of familiaritywith the local language and culture, isolation, fear of reprisal and mistrust of local author-ities (whether real or imagined) all contribute to sustaining an ongoing exploitative rela-tionship with traffickers. Preventing, or limiting, demand is different from preventingexploitation. Prevention becomes important in countries of destination, although both thefactors contributing to vulnerability as well as the methods of empowering individuals willbe different from those used in countries of origin. Primary targets for prevention activi-ties, notably awareness-raising campaigns, are clients, consumers and members of the dif-ferent communities where trafficked persons may be found. 40International Labour Office, A Global Alliance against Forced ... .AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 76V. Practical implications for a vulnerability-based programme for the prevention of trafficking Conditions of vulnerability are rarely brought about by individual agency or choice. They are, instead, the results of policies as well as social and cultural practices that place individuals in circumstances where they feel that they have no choice but to submit to aharmful alternative. It should also be evident that the conditions described above contribute to an individual's vulnerability to many forms of exploitation, abuse and hard-ship, including human trafficking, although it is not possible to cite any single conditionas being the sole determinant of vulnerability to any one form of abuse. Study of victimsof human trafficking and domestic violence, as well as of those most vulnerable to rampant epidemics, indicates that these individuals share many of the same characteristicsof vulnerability. It would appear to make fiscal as well as practical sense, therefore, toexamine prevention from a broader perspective. How are such conditions of vulnerability to be used to identify individuals at risk of being trafficked and make prevention of trafficking more effective? In re-examining existing prevention policies on the basis of an understanding of conditions of vulnerability, a frame-work must be developed that will include the following: Inclusion. The involvement of all relevant actors (individuals, community groups, NGOs and government agencies) in the development of prevention programmes Risk reduction. An assessment of the scope of the problem in a country, as well as an assessment of factors that make individuals vulnerable to exploitation leading totrafficking and other forms of abuse, relevant to each specific context Empowerment. Improvement of the well-being of the individual, including empowerment of the individual to seek options that are not potentially harmful or exploitative The Grameen Bank: an example of prevention through vulnerability reduction Micro-enterprise development is frequently cited among prevention activities to address theeconomic needs of possible victims of trafficking and of returning trafficked persons. Criticsof such programmes, however, have raised concerns that a \"one-model-fits-all\" approach tohelping trafficked persons is not always helpful and indeed, in some cases, can cause harm.The most common criticisms directed towards those programmes focusing on womeninclude: (a) Trafficked women need extensive physical and psychological rehabilitation before theycan begin to establish their own business. It is not reasonable to expect that a person who has experienced severe trauma can immediately begin the complexprocess of developing and implementing a business plan; 41PART ONE. \u2014VULNERABILITY 77(b) Limited training and the provision of seed money do not necessarily prepare women for an entrepreneurial life;42 (c) In communities targeted for trafficking prevention activities, women who express aninterest in entrepreneurial activities may often be outside of the age group most vulnerable to trafficking, although they may be considered vulnerable to other formsof abuse and exploitation, notably domestic violence; (d) An entrepreneurial life is solitary and women do not feel that they have sufficient support; 43 (e) In some cultures, the empowerment of women is seen as an affront to the men ofthe community and the negative consequences outweigh any realized economic benefits. 44 These opinions are worth examining, especially because, in some areas, microfinance pro-grammes have proved successful in alleviating poverty, increasing the well-being of entirecommunities and providing options for economic self-sufficiency for indivi-duals who wereat one time reduced to conditions of debt bondage and servitude. 45 Muhammed Yunus, an economist from Bangladesh, founded the Grameen Bank as a way ofproviding the poorest inhabitants of his country with small loans to encourage personal initiative and ultimately break the cycle of poverty over their lives. Almost 20 years later,the Grameen Bank model is used throughout the world as a means of empowering indivi-duals to improve their own lives. Furthermore, as a business, it makes good sense. It is ahighly cost-effective business and enjoys a remarkably high loan repayment rate. 46 The Grameen Bank works because it identifies factors that make people vulnerable toexploitation and is closely linked to the cultural and social contexts of vulnerable women.Project ideas are generated by the loan applicants, who are grouped together in teams wherethey are mutually accountable to one another for the repayment of their debts as well asfor support. Any gain benefits the entire community and this factor alone provides a strongincentive to the ongoing success of its initiatives. 41Rosenberg and others, op. cit. 42Barbara Limanowska, Trafficking in Human Beings in South Eastern Europe, 2004: Focus on Prevention in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, Serbia andMontenegro and the UN Administered Province of Kosovo, joint report by the United Nations Children's Fund, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Office for Democratic Institutions and HumanRights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (New York, United Nations DevelopmentProgramme, 2005). 43Rosenberg and others, op. cit. 44Maria Vlachov\u00e1 and Lea Biason, eds., Women in an Insecure World: Violence against Women - Facts, Figures and Analysis (Geneva, Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces, 2005). 45Nathanael Goldberg, Measuring the Impact of Microfinance: Taking Stock of What We Know (Washington, D.C., Grameen Foundation USA, 2005). 46Mark Schreiner, \"A cost-effectiveness analysis of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh\", Development Policy Review, vol. 21, No. 3 (2003), pp. 357-382.78VI.\u2014Conclusion This paper has outlined a comprehensive approach to preventing trafficking in human beings based on both an understanding of the conditions that render an individual vulnerable to trafficking and the empowerment of the individual to resist potentially dangerous situations in the presence of viable alternatives. The new definition of the term\"vulnerability\" provided here is offered as a guideline to both developing comprehensiveprevention strategies as well as to identifying those responsible for changing potentiallyharmful policies and practices. There is one final factor that contributes to conditions of vulnerability leading to the ongoing exploitation of men, women and children around the world that has not yet been mentioned here: human na\u00efvet\u00e9. The world recently watched the jubilantcelebrations marking the 200th anniversary of the end of the transatlantic slave trade, allthe while forgetting that individuals remain in bondage around the world. Prevention is vital and yet it fails to attract attention. A person who is trafficked and bears physical signs of abuse and violence is a visible and newsworthy target for help. Helpingvictims gets good press. Most trafficking stories in the popular media focus on the exploitation of victims of trafficking, and a reporter's first question, when calling an NGOor government agency will be: \"Can I interview a victim?\" But the coverage\u2014and theresponse\u2014remains myopic. Directing media attention, donor funds and political will primarily towards the visible end result of a cycle of abuse and exploitation rather thanaddressing what allows the cycle to occur in the first place will ensure that trafficking inhuman beings continues. Conditions of vulnerability are systemic, entrenched within the social, economic and educational policies of nations. They are further fuelled by racism and discrimination basedon gender, ethnic and cultural considerations. It is necessary to ask, therefore, why andhow we as donors, policymakers, care-givers and nations have failed to take the preventive actions necessary and, by that failure, have contributed to an escalation of thevery problem we seek to prevent.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTIONPART TWO Impact 81The impact of trafficking in persons Judith Dixon I.\u2014Introduction Human trafficking today is a global phenomenon, affecting men, women and children in over 130 countries of the world.1Trafficking is a crime against individuals.2As such, the consequences are most directly felt by trafficked persons. As well documented, traffickingactivities contravene fundamental human rights, denying people basic and broadly acceptedindividual freedoms. Trafficking also has broad economic, social and cultural conse-quences. As a criminal act, trafficking violates the rule of law, threatening national juris-dictions and international law. Further, trafficking in persons redirects the benefits ofmigration from migrants, their families, community and government or other potentiallegitimate employers to the traffickers and their associates. Difficult as it is to measureaccurately the scope of human trafficking, it is equally difficult to measure its impact. Thedynamics of the trade are constantly evolving and a range of national perspectives exist.Available statistics are dependent upon a variety of sources, methodologies and defini-tions. Because trafficking is an underground activity, its consequences are also hidden andadequate indicators have yet to be developed that will allow the anti-trafficking commu-nity to successfully measure the impact of this crime. This paper identifies some of themost notable social, political and economic impacts of human trafficking and outlinesimportant policy considerations in each of these areas. 1United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns (Vienna, United Nations, 2006). 2Trafficking in persons and the smuggling of migrants are distinct crimes. While there are many similar components, there are four important differences: (a) Consent. The smuggling of migrants, while often undertaken in dangerous or degrading conditions, involves migrants who have consented to the smuggling. Trafficking victims, on the other hand, have either never consented or, if they initially consented, that consent has been rendered meaningless by the coercive, deceptiveor abusive actions of the traffickers; (b) Exploitation. Smuggling ends with the migrants' arrival at their destination, whereas trafficking involves the ongoing exploitation of the victims in some manner to generate illicit profits for the traffickers. From a practicalstandpoint, victims of trafficking also tend to be affected more severely and become more traumatized by theirexperiences and are also in greater need of protection from revictimization and other forms of further abusethan are smuggled migrants; (c) Source of profits. The financial benefits derived from these crimes come from quite different activities. Those who smuggle migrants profit from effecting the transportation of migrants from one country to another. Thekey source of criminal income from human trafficking is the exploitation of victims in the countries they aretransported to; (d) Transnationality. Smuggling is always transnational, whereas trafficking may not be. Trafficking can occur regard- less of whether victims are taken to another country or only moved from one place to another within the samecountry. For further reference, see the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, EspeciallyWomen and Children (General Assembly resolution 55/25, annex II), and the Protocol against the Smugglingof Migrants by Land, Sea and Air (resolution 55/25, annex III), both supplementing the United NationsConvention against Transnational Organized Crime; available at www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CTOC/index.html.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 82While these impacts are described separately below, in reality they cannot be so readily compartmentalized or discussed in isolation. There are significant and complex interrela-tionships, influences and overlapping factors within each area. Impacts may both con-tribute to and/or influence each other in many ways and they are frequently closelyinterwoven. Recognition of the complex nature of trafficking in persons and how it hasan impact upon us is pivotal to informing action taken in response and, ultimately, to sus-taining success in countering human trafficking. II.\u2014The consequences of trafficking upon individuals Violent crime can have a significant impact upon the health and well-being of its victims. The effects of victimization strike particularly hard at the poor, the powerless, the disabledand the socially isolated. Those already affected by prior victimization are particularly sus-ceptible to subsequent victimization. The effects of trafficking have an impact on individuals in all areas of their lives. Victims of trafficking often experience abuse, exploitation, poverty and poor health prior to beingtrafficked. These conditions are only exacerbated by their experiences as victims of crime. 3 Each stage of the trafficking process can involve physical, sexual and psychological abuseand violence, deprivation and torture, the forced use of substances, manipulation, eco-nomic exploitation and abusive working and living conditions. 4What differentiates the consequences of trafficking from the effects of singular traumatic events is that traffick-ing usually involves prolonged and repeated trauma. 5 A.\u2014The physical impact of trafficking All forms of trafficking, because of the abusive and exploitative nature of the crime, pro- duce harmful effects on trafficked individuals. For example, the National Human RightsCommission of Thailand reported in 2003 the impact of trafficking on a group of approx-imately 100 male fishermen. After three years of exploitation, 39 had died, while thosewho returned home were seriously ill\u2014emaciated, emotionally disturbed and unable to see,hear or walk properly. 6 Trafficked victims may be deliberately selected for their specific physical attributes, whichare then exploited in specific labour conditions. For example, the small size and dexte-rity of children makes them desirable for work at rug looms where t he exploitati on of these 3United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, Handbook on Justice for Victims: On the Use and Application of the Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power(New York, 1999), p. 7. 4United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.06.V.11), p. 154. 5Cathy Zimmerman and others, The Health Risks and Consequences of Trafficking in Women and Adolescents: Findings from a European Study (London, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 2003), p. 23 (see http://www.lshtm.ac.uk/hpu/docs/traffickingfinal.pdf). 6Subhatra Bhumiprabhas, \"The misery of male slavery\", The Nation (Thailand), 14 May 2007 (see www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/05/14/headlines/headlines_30034148.php).PART TWO. \u2014IMPACT 83physical attributes leaves them with eye damage, lung disease, stunted growth and a sus- ceptibility to arthritis as they grow older. Small children making silk thread dip their handsinto boiling water that burns and blisters them, breath smoke and fumes from machinery,handle dead worms that cause infections and guide twisting threads that cut their fingers. 7 However, in terms of global documentation, most is known about the impact of traffick-ing upon women and children for purposes of sexual exploitation. Detailed research onthe physical consequences of trafficking upon women is relatively new. In 2006, a majorstudy gathered statistical evidence on the health needs of women who had recently escapedfrom a trafficking situation, most of whom had been trafficked for commercial sexualexploitation. The findings indicate that more than half of the 207 respondents, from 14different countries, reported some form of violence prior to being trafficked. Nearly allrespondents (95 per cent) reported physical or sexual violence, with three quarters ofrespondents having been physically hurt, and 90 per cent reporting having been sexuallyassaulted, all of which occurred while being trafficked. Most respondents had been threat-ened with violence and forced into performing sexual acts. Physical symptoms of thesetrafficked women included headaches, fatigue and weight loss, stomach, chest, back, pelvicand vaginal pain, as well as dental and eye, ear and skin problems. A majority consistent-ly reported vaginal discharge and gynaecological infections, which usually remaineduntreated. This is consistent with earlier work and estimates on the extent of health prob-lems expected to be experienced by women trafficked for sexual exploitation. 8 B.\u2014HIV/AIDS Increased likelihood of HIV infection is often cited as a risk among women trafficked for sexual exploitation owing notably to a lack of bargaining power concerning condom useand other potentially dangerous sexual practices. Trafficked women are also less likely tobe beneficiaries of medical or educational services made available to non-trafficked womenworking in prostitution. 9Lack of information about HIV/AIDS, as well as prevalent pop- ular misconceptions, including that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure the diseaseand that younger girls are disease-free, has increased the demand for younger victims andincreased the vulnerability of children to infection. 10 A recent study focusing on the prevalence and predictors of HIV infection among traf-ficked women and girls rescued from brothels in a South Asian country found that 22.9per cent of trafficked individuals tested positive for HIV. Those trafficked at younger agesand having spent a longer time in brothels were slightly more likely to become infected 7\"Child labor\", article available on the website of Human Rights Watch at http://hrw.org/children/labor.htm. 8Cathy Zimmerman and others, Stolen Smiles: a Summary Report on the Physical and Psychological Health Consequences of Women and Adolescents Trafficked in Europe (London, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 2006), pp. 9-15 (see www.lshtm.ac.uk/genderviolence/). 9\"Youth against HIV/AIDS and Service Scheme (NSS) volunteers in Mahrashtra: inter-linkages and vulnerability of trafficking and HIV/AIDS\", project available on the website of Save theChildren India at www.karmayog.com/ngos/stci.htm. 10United Nations Development Programme, From Challenges to Opportunities: Response to Trafficking and HIV/AIDS in South Asia (UNDP, 2003), p. 7 (see http://www.youandaids.org/UNDP_REACH_publications).AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 84with the HIV virus.11These findings demonstrate the need for increased attention to HIV among young victims of sex trafficking in research and practice. It is difficult to determine the absolute rates of HIV infection among trafficked persons and little researchhas been done to determine whether these rates are higher than those of non-traffickedprostituted women or than those in the general community. 12 C.\u2014Mental health impact Relentless anxiety, insecurity, fear and physical pain and injury will have significant effects on the mental health and well-being of trafficked victims. Symptoms of psychological trau-ma reported by trafficked persons include post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depres-sion, alienation and disorientation. These individuals report feelings of extreme sadnessand hopelessness about the future. 13They may be suicidal, have cognitive impairment and memory loss, and may be withdrawn. They may also have difficulty concentrating andshow aggression and anger. Studies indicate that trauma worsens throughout the durationof the trafficking process. Initial trauma commonly experienced either before they weretrafficked or when they first discovered that they were trafficked, will be continuallyincreased by the process of the trafficking. The longer victims remain under the controlof their traffickers, the more severe and long-lasting are the effects of their trauma. Thesymptoms may persist for a long time after the trafficking experience unless support andappropriate counselling is provided. 14 D.\u2014Child victims Child victims of trafficking are subject to the same harmful treatment as adults. Their age makes them even more vulnerable to the harmful consequences of abusive practices.Prolonged abuse in children, including physical and sexual abuse, hunger and malnutrition,may lead to permanent stunting of growth. Trafficked children may suffer, for example,from poorly formed or rotting teeth and may experience reproductive problems at a laterdate. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has documented that children in sometropical regions are at high risk of sunstroke, increased heart rhythm, poisoning due tochemicals in insecticides, dust inhalation in sawmills and mines, machinery accidents,burns, road accidents, stagnation of growth and general fatigue that makes them less resistant to malaria and other diseases because of their exposure to harsh working conditions. 15 11J.

The emotional well-being, self-esteem and ability to set personal goals and form healthy relationships of these younger victims of trafficking willbe significantly damaged. Trafficked children find it difficult to trust authority figures. If their trafficking situation was initiated by a family member, or if they were very young, they may be subsequentlyunable to return to their families or connect with them. They may have attachment problems and anti-social behaviours, aggression, sexualized behaviour or addictions. Ifoffered a chance at education, they may suffer developmental delays, language and cognitive difficulties, deficits in verbal and memory skills, poorer academic performanceand grade retention. They may experience difficulty in adapting themselves to the rules,regulations and discipline of the education system. 16 E.\u2014Substance abuse Trafficked victims may be subjected to substance abuse by their traffickers. Some traf- ficked women have described how they were forced to use drugs or alcohol to ensuretheir compliance and to enable them to take on more clients, work longer hours or perform objectionable or risky acts. 17Trafficked persons may also turn to substance abuse to alleviate the pain of their situation, often resulting in addiction, organ damage, malnutrition, needle-induced infections, overdose and death. F.\u2014Impact on behaviour Prolonged physical and mental abuse affects victims' behaviour in negative ways, having an impact on both physical and emotional responses. Because trafficked persons oftenexperience extreme forms of trauma over long periods of time, their capacities both tounderstand what has happened to them and to describe their experiences are directlyimpaired as a result of such abuse. Victims can find that it is difficult to make personalsense of the abuse they have experienced, much less try to explain it to the authorities.They are even less able to identify what help they might need as a result of the abuse. 18 This lack of clarity may have negative consequences when a victim is being interviewed 16Yvonne Rafferty, \"Child trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation: psychological and social policy perspectives\", presentation available on the website of the Pace University at http://appserv.pace.edu/emplibrary/yvon-neraffertypresentation050107.pdf, slides 15 and 16. 17Zimmerman and others, The Health Risks and Consequences ... , p. 4. 18Zimmerman and others, Stolen Smiles ... , p. 22.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 86by relevant authorities. Trafficked persons may be unsure of how they are supposed to answer questions. They may be reluctant to disclose information, or may give false information, be irritable or hostile and aggressive towards others, even support persons.They may seem complaining, uncooperative or ungrateful. As a result, they may not beidentified as victims of crime, further compounding the injustice they have experienced.In many instances, failure to identify a person as a trafficking victim commonly results indeportation from the country of transit or destination without access to legal, medical orsocial services. Such behaviour, however, may manifest in individuals for many years. Upon return to the country of origin, assistance to trafficked persons will depend on existing economic, political and social conditions. Assistance, when available, may be contingent upon certain behaviours and conditions, for example, zero tolerance of substance abuse and adherence to structured daily regimens. Victims may be too trauma-tized to participate effectively in programmes, take decisions, show preferences or accepthelp. Unaddressed physical health symptoms and chronic pain will also affect victims' ability to participate in programmes available for their assistance. In some countries, service programmes and providers limit a victim's right to determine what is best for them-selves. Where \"assistance\" is perceived as placing unnecessary or unwanted restrictionson victims, trafficked individuals may respond through various forms of uncooperativebehaviour. Worst case examples are those which impose a \"victim\" status on a traffickingperson that further victimizes, rather than rehabilitates, that individual. Fear, in its many manifestations, is also a common behavioural response to return. Leaving aside the stigma and shame associated with trafficking, trafficking victims anticipate andfrequently suffer reprisals upon return to their points of origin, from threats and actualphysical violence against themselves or those close to them through to the very real pos-sibility, in many cases, of being retrafficked. G.\u2014Stigma The response of family members and the community will have an impact upon the recov- ery process of trafficked persons. Although more is known about the stigma facing vic-tims of trafficking for sexual exploitation, all trafficked persons may face social disapprovalif they return without promised wealth, regardless of the harm they suffered. 19In many countries, the impact of the trauma is influenced significantly by how victims imaginetheir culture will view their experiences. Many victims know that cultural attitudes to pros-titution could prevent them from being accepted by their families and communities. Insome cultures the entire family could be ostracized as a result of the victim's past. 20 19\"More needs to be done to address stigma and discrimination towards women trafficked for sexual exploitation\", International Organization for Migration, Regional Office in Finland, press release for InternationalWomen's Day, 8 March 2006 (see www.pld.iom.int/en/news). 20Elizabeth Peffer Talbot, \"An assault on the soul: an international plaque in the 21st century\", paper presented at the Convention of the North American Association of Christians in Social Work, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 2006, page 5 (see www.nacsw.org/Publications/Proceedings2006/TalbotEAnAssaultontheSoulE.pdf).PART TWO. \u2014IMPACT 87In a recent national study, surveyed communities exhibited some understanding of the role of social and economic hardships in vulnerability to trafficking, but overwhelminglyblamed the immoral character of the trafficked girl herself, who was seen to bring disgraceand shame to her family and community. Returned victims were considered likely to continue as prostitutes or try to recruit other young girls as prostitutes\u2014all trafficking wasassociated with sex work, and those who were trafficked were assumed to be infected with HIV/AIDS and to be a source of infection in the communities. 21 Prevention messages may unknowingly contribute to the stigmas surrounding a traffickedperson, notably in the way they portray the negative results of a trafficking situation. Forexample, some campaigns use fear to discourage women from leaving their homes andassociate trafficking with contracting HIV, implying that all women trafficked for sexualexploitation have HIV/AIDS. 22 Even participation in a recognized return programme for victims of trafficking may exposetrafficked persons to the stigma of prostitution. Men trafficked for sexual purposes mayexperience the double shame and stigma of being branded a prostitute and of having sexwith men despite not being homosexual themselves. 23In some cases victims will simply move away from the home area and return to prostitution, while others choose not toreveal anything at all about the trafficking experience, with this choice significantly affecting their physical and psychological recovery. 24 H.\u2014Recovery Return and reintegration for a trafficked person is a long-term and complex process with no guarantee of recovery. Even where physical problems can be addressed and stigmaovercome, trauma and psychological damage make recovery a difficult task rendered evenmore so by the problems in accessing necessary resources and in communicating withsupport persons and family. Some trafficked victims may not adjust to a lifestyle that theypreviously considered \"normal\". If employment can be found, a trafficked person's behaviour, as a result of the experiences of severe trauma, may make it difficult to remainemployed. 21Vaishali Sharma Mahendra and others, Community Perceptions of Trafficking and its Determinants in Nepal (Kathmandu/New Delhi, Asia Foundation, Horizons and Population Council, December 2001), p. 53 (see http://www.asiafoundation.org/pdf/nepal_traffickingperceptios.pdf). 22Asia Foundation, Horizons and Population Council, \"Research summary: trafficking and human rights in Nepal: community perceptions and policy and program responses\", August 2001, p. 4, (see http://www.popcouncil.org/pdfs/horizons/traffickingsum1.pdf). 23Barbara Limanowska, \"Anti-trafficking action in south-eastern Europe: lack of effectiveness of law enforcement and migration approaches\", paper prepared for the Consultative Meeting on Migration and Mobility and how thismovement affects women, Malm\u00f6, Sweden, 2-4 December 2003 (CM/MMW/2003/EP.6)(see http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/meetings/consult/CM-Dec03-EP6.pdf). 24Diana Tudorache, A General Review of the Psychological Support and Services Provided to Victims of Trafficking, outcome of empirical analysis assisted by the Counter-Trafficking Return and Re-integration Programme, InternationalOrganization for Migration Kosovo, September 2003, p. 84.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 88Problems may be compounded if, as often happens, trafficked persons are returned to their place of origin to face the same problems of unemployment, abuse and discrimina-tion that compelled them to leave in the first place, all of which may be exacerbated bythe new stigma. With previous victimization a better predictor of future victimization thanany other characteristic of crime, these circumstances contribute extra risk. 25For some, especially those who survived longer periods in a trafficking situation, a return to a situ-ation of exploitation may provide the only alternative for which their practical skills andsurvival mentality are now oriented. 26 III.\u2014The political implications of trafficking in persons In addition to the tragic impact on individuals, human trafficking has now reached such a scale that it has begun to influence the domestic and foreign policies of many of thecountries where the problem has become particularly noted. Because trafficking involvesthe movement of people across international borders, one of the most important areas ofdebate is migration policy. However, because trafficking in persons is also a deeply humanissue, it has become a major issue of discussion and concern in human rights circles. Thefollowing discussion will outline what are some of the major concerns and challenges ineach of these two areas. A.\u2014Shaping migration policies Unprecedented numbers of people leave their homes and families every year in search of economic opportunities that are not available to them at home. Many of these individu-als migrate legally. The numbers are so great, however, and the restrictions on regular orlegal migration usually so stringent, that many migrants become absorbed into the illicitworld of people smuggling. In too many cases, smuggling leads to conditions of ongoingexploitation and human misery. Commonly, many States equate \"trafficking\" with \"illegalmigration\" or \"smuggling of aliens\" or movement of asylum-seekers, even though these aredifferent\u2014albeit often overlapping\u2014phenomena. It is within this overall concept and notas a separate issue that trafficking in persons has helped to shape migration policies, incountries both of origin and destination. 25United States of America, Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Deborah Lamm Weisel, Analysing Repeat Victimisation, Problem-Oriented Guides for Police, Problem-Solving Tools Series No. 4 (Washington, D.C., August 2005) (see http://www.cops.usdoj.gov/files/ric/Publications/e07055803.pdf). 26Tudorache, op. cit., p. 94.PART TWO. \u2014IMPACT 89B.\u2014Border control Just as a common response to irregular migration has been to tighten borders, so too have countries responded to the increase in human trafficking by strengthening border control.Stricter border controls and increased law enforcement are common methods. 27 Expenditure on border control is increasing rapidly throughout Australia, the UnitedStates, Western Europe and other perceived destination areas. 28 At the global and regional levels, international cooperation in addressing trafficking islargely within the context of action to deter and prevent irregular movements and the pro-motion of national legislation to assist in this. The Bali Process on People Smuggling,Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, set up in South-East Asia, has astrong crime control emphasis and focuses on capacity-building of operational-level lawenforcement, immigration and other key personnel involved in combating migrant smug-gling, trafficking in persons and related forms of transnational crime. 29In Western and Central Europe, the European Union has focused extensively on issues of smuggling andtrafficking within the context of controlling immigration from outside. Following the 1999Tampere European Council, which guaranteed access to European territory to asylum-seekers, draft council directives were formulated on penal frameworks for those who facil-itate unauthorized entry and residence. 30 Regional forums all include bilateral aid and trade programmes, assistance with povertyalleviation and development as part of their focus. These policies are directly linked tothe expectation that increases in overseas development and humanitarian assistance willalso result in decreases in irregular migration, including trafficking. 31 C.\u2014Human rights When trafficking is defined within the context of irregular migration, the crime control focus becomes the illegal entry or stay in a country, that is, infraction of state laws bythe migrant him- or herself. This focus raises the danger that the human rights abuses andexploitation that are the characteristics of trafficking may not be addressed. Even whengovernment measures primarily target the recruiters and exploiters, trafficked persons areat risk of being considered collaborators in illegal migration rather than as victims ofcrime. 32 27Raimo V\u00e4yrynen, \"Illegal immigration, human trafficking, and organized crime\", discussion paper No. 2003/72 (Helsinki, United Nations University, World Institute for Development Economics Research, October 2003), p. 4 (see http://www.wider.unu.edu/publications/dps/dps2003/dp2003-072.pdf) . 28Bimal Ghosh, \"Managing migration: whither the missing regime?\", draft article in the Migration Without Borders series, document SHS/2005/MWB/4 (Paris, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, 15February 2005), p. 2 (see http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001391/139149E.pdf) . 29Australia, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, \"Background to the Bali process\" (see http://www.dfat.gov.au/illegal_immigration/bali_process_background.html). 30John Morrison, \"Human smuggling and trafficking\", Forced Migration Online Research Guide (October 2002) (see http://www.forcedmigration.org/guides/fmo011/) .31John Morrison, \"The trafficking and smuggling of refugees: the end game in European asylum policy?\", pre- publication edition, commissioned by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, July 2000,p. 93 (see http://www.ecre.org/eu_developments/controls/traffick.pdf) . 32Statement adopted by the European NGO Conference, held in Noordwijkerhout from 5 to 7 April 1997, for presentation to the EU Ministerial Conference from 24 to 26 April 1997.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 90The unintended consequence of this approach can be severe. To cross closed borders, irregular migrants are more likely to use professional smugglers or traffickers. The involve-ment of criminal groups in migration means that smuggling may lead to exploitation andpotential instances of trafficking, victimization and the violation of human rights. With trafficking being potentially more profitable than smuggling, owing to the ongoing exploitation of the victim, States of destination may be inadvertently creating a lucrativemarket for the traffickers. The more strictly the laws of immigration against the illegalentrants are enforced, the more sophisticated forms of criminality are used in human traf-ficking to overcome the barriers that are needed to making a profit. This may increase theviolence and abuse associated with the practice. 32 The impact of focusing on trafficking as a migration issue is significant. As the Secretary-General stated on 21 November 2003: \"The more we try to deal with migration simply by clamping down on it with tighter border controls, the more we find that human rights are sacrificed\u2014on the journey,at the border, and inside the host countries.\" 33 The vast majority of asylum-seekers now enter Europe and other regions of destinationin an irregular fashion and quite possibly with the assistance of traffickers and smugglers.This may in turn lead to further blurring of the categories of people movements and threat-en the right of asylum. 34It is necessary for destination countries to develop accurate and reliable protocols to determine the status of all individuals who have entered their bor-ders under seemingly illegal means acknowledging the possibility that these individualsmay be victims of crime. D.\u2014Regular migration: countries of destination As a result of the increase of illegal migration, many countries of destination have tight- ened their immigration requirements. While the demand for unskilled domestic and careworkers, women in particular, has increased, countries of destination have restricted theflow of regular or legal migration by imposing educational, language and other require-ments. Short-term contracts with dependence upon specific employers, lengthy contractapproval processes, certification of skills, recruitment fees, bonds, police and health checksand travel costs may further impede legitimate migration. These practices may not be designed specifically to address trafficking, but are rather aimed at regulating and controlling legal immigration. The possible discrimination againstunskilled migrants (in the face of the growing demand) can have the unintended impact 32Statement adopted by the European NGO Conference, held in Noordwijkerhout from 5 to 7 April 1997, for presentation to the EU Ministerial Conference from 24 to 26 April 1997. 33Franciscans International and others, \"The migration and trafficking nexus\"; statement submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its sixtieth session (E/CN.4/2004/NGO/115) (see http://www.franciscansinterna-tional.org/docs/statement.php?id=240). 34Morrison, \"The 101.PART TWO. \u2014IMPACT 91of further increasing the vulnerability of migrants to being trafficked.35Where a legal opportunity cannot be found, potential migrants may turn to traffickers for assistance.Restrictive migration policies that limit opportunities to migrate safely and legally will fueldemand for the services of traffickers. E.\u2014Regular migration: source countries It becomes important for labour-exporting nations, which are the primary source coun- tries for trafficking, to manage migration in such a way that it contributes to social andeconomic development and is not seen as a danger by their own citizens, a threat to pub-lic security or as stigmatizing their citizens. Some source countries attempt to protect theircitizens from exploitation through a variety of regulated programmes prior to departure.Some important methods commonly used in the Philippines, for example, include a rangeof subsidized benefits, including pre-migration training on social and work conditionsabroad, life insurance and pension plans, medical insurance and tuition assistance for themigrant and his or her family, and eligibility for pre-departure and emergency loans. 36 Nevertheless, despite these efforts, significant numbers of migrants, especially women, fallinto conditions of exploitation and trafficking. Other source countries may impose discriminatory exit requirements and may restrict migration among certain population groups, notably women. These restrictions may stemfrom a country's norms related to the status of women or as a direct response to abuseor exploitation perceived in countries of destination. The restrictions may take the form ofcomplete bans or age-, occupation- and country-specific limitations on women's emigration. 37 In some source regions, well intended trafficking prevention messages have sometimestaken a negative position on migration. Frightening messages about the dangers of migra- tion have been used to discourage women from leaving their villages. 38The unintended con- sequence of such strategies may make individuals more vulnerable to exploitation.39Poor women job-seekers, in particular from remote rural areas with less access to accurate infor-mation on migration procedures, job opportunities, recruitment channels and legitimatejobs, are at higher risk of being trafficked in these situations. Given the global demandfor female labour and the increasing willingness of female migrants to travel overseas,restrictive female migration policies will encourage women to use informal or irregular channels to assist their movement. This in turn increases their vulnerability totrafficking. 40 35Naila Kabeer, \"Footloose\" Female Labour: Transnational Migration, Social Protection and Citizenship in the Asia Region (Ottawa, International Development Research Centre, 2007) section 6.1 (see http://www.idrc.ca/uploads/user-S/11829727461WRC_WP1_-_Kabeer_-_Migration.doc). 36Kevin O'Neil, \"Labor export as government policy: the case of the Philippines\", Migration Information Source, January 2004 (see http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/print.cfm?ID=191). 37Kabeer, op. cit. 38John Davies, \"The role of migration policy in creating and sustaining trafficking harm\", University of Sussex, Migration Research Centre, 31 August 2002, p. 5 (see http://www.belgium.iom.int/STOPConference/Conference%20Papers/OSLO.pdf). 39\"Anti-trafficking policies and programs in Nepal may infringe on women's rights\", Population Briefs , vol. 7, No. 4 (2001) (see http://www.popcouncil.org/publications/popbriefs/pb7(4)_1.html). 40Jean D'Cunha, \"Trafficking in persons: a gender and rights perspective\", paper prepared for the Expert Group Meeting on trafficking in women and girls, Glen Cove, New York, 18 22 November 2002 (EGM/TRAF/2002/EP.8), p. 19 (see http://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/trafficking2002/reports/EP-DCunha.pdf).AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 92F.\u2014Management of the status of trafficked persons The detection and identification of trafficked persons in countries of destination raises significant political and social challenges. States are faced with reconciling their obliga-tions under the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, EspeciallyWomen and Children, to protect victims with their own domestic policies of preventingirregular migration. Trafficked persons will not usually have a regular residence status inthe State of destination, either because they arrived in an irregular way or because theirresidence permit has expired. A number of countries of destination have recently recognized the humanitarian risks of returning victims precipitously to their country of origin. To address both their humanrights obligations and their national security and migration requirements, several destina-tion States have adopted measures for the temporary or permanent residence of victimsof trafficking. In some cases, that protection entitles the victims to other rights and ben-efits. Additionally, in some countries, reflection periods are granted to allow for a periodof time in which the presumed trafficked person is referred for services and counselling,without having to make an immediate statement to the police. This enables trafficked per-sons to receive appropriate support and to make informed decisions. Such support andassistance will assist in their recovery and may encourage them to testify against traffick-ers, assisting in successful prosecutions. Early assistance can promote recovery and mayin turn have a positive future impact on the reduction of trafficking, by preventing re-trafficking. Cooperative bilateral assistance efforts between the State of destination andthe State of origin have also been developed in some cases and will assist in reducing therisks faced by victims.PART TWO. \u2014IMPACT 93IV.\u2014The economic impact of trafficking in persons A.\u2014The costs of trafficking The cost of crime is essentially a measure of the impact of that crime on society. The costs of trafficking include the value of all resources devoted to its prevention, the treat-ment and support of victims and the apprehension and prosecution of offenders. Forexample, as a component of organized crime, there are costs to the police (who investi-gate suspected crime and gather and record evidence), the prosecution services, criminalcourts, legal aid and non-legally-aided defence costs, and costs of the prison and proba-tion services. The foregone productivity of imprisoned traffickers (although such labourmay not in all cases have been put to productive use) should be included. There may alsobe costs to witness protection schemes and health, welfare and other government servi-ces. While in some countries a successful prosecution may mean some cost recovery andasset confiscation, in most circumstances, the resources devoted to these elements of thecriminal justice system and health and welfare systems come from the public purse, whichmay severely challenge existing resources, notably in source countries. Realizing the poten-tial to offset these costs through the confiscation of traffickers' income and assets is ofgreat significance to continued success against trafficking activities. These costs are linked with the human and social costs to the victims and their commu- nities and may include the physical and emotional suffering of victims as well as the tollupon community members who may develop increased fear and anxiety about crime asa result of public trials and media attention. Given that violence, corruption and traffick-ing are invariably linked, the cost of enforcement and reform may be affected by publicperceptions that government cannot cope with criminal organizations. The ongoing care and support of victims, costs associated with immigration and customs processes, repatriation, direct government funding or funding grants to non-governmentalorganizations to assist victims, along with other health, welfare housing and associatedcosts, will also have an impact. For some source countries especially, this is a significanteconomic burden. While expenditures on trafficking prevention programmes, advocacy and research proj- ects may be seen as discretionary, such expenditures are often accepted by Governmentsthat are parties to the Trafficking Protocol as a requirement of their domestic commitmentto addressing the crime of trafficking and a part of their enforcement efforts against thecrime. The public health impact of trafficking is potentially very costly. Recent epidemiological data suggest that tuberculosis, which is regarded worldwide as a re-emerging infectiousdisease, has reached the level of an epidemic in some countries from which victims aretrafficked. 41In areas where vaccination programmes and health service standards and 41\"Conference background information and further readings\", paper presented to the regional workshop and conference entitled \"Health Aspects of Trafficking in Persons\", Budapest, 19 21 March 2003 (see http://hub.usem-bassy.hu/programs/background.doc).AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 94protocols are not widely developed or infection rates are higher, diseases such as tuber- culosis or HIV/AIDS may be brought to the country of destination, with attendant costsand problems. B.\u2014Lost resources Human trafficking results in an irretrievable loss of human resources and reductions in revenue. Trafficking yields no tax revenues, and may even lead to a net revenue loss asa result of tax evasion and money-laundering. There will be a lower accumulation of humancapital and a lower rate of participation in the labour market. In source countries, traffick-ing will influence the future productivity of children, who may lose access to educationor suffer health problems where a parent is trafficked and family support is lost. Therewill be fewer individuals available to care for elderly people or children, with fewerresources. Non-monetary economic loss such as health-related impacts may be significant, as traf- ficked victims and their families suffer the consequences of this crime. Since traffickingmay result in premature death, a possible consequence is the loss of the future produc-tive capacity of the victim. As is also common for families of homicide victims, or thosewho die prematurely because of crime, the emotional, psychological, and social impactswill be borne by the family and community of the deceased person. When victims are repatriated to their country of origin, the burden of assistance and reha- bilitation is shifted to the source country, where resources are often already limited. Thefuture impact of untreated health and welfare needs will be significant. In many cases fam-ilies and communities will be required to take on this additional human, social and eco-nomic burden. The effects of the bribery and corruption known to accompany trafficking practices may destabilize regulatory regimes and their supporting infrastructure and also significantlyinhibit much needed overseas investment and trade. 42 C.\u2014Remittances The most direct economic impact of human trafficking on individuals is the receipt of lit- tle or no income and, consequently, the loss of migrant remittances. While it is not pos-sible to sensibly estimate the potential value of the labour of trafficked persons, someStates have taken tentative steps, on occasion in assessing compensation, to calculateincome payments due to trafficking victims. While compensation payments remain rareand generally constitute small financial sums, a well documented motivation for manyidentified trafficking victims in initially consenting to approaches by traffickers is, firstly,the opportunity to earn an anticipated level of income and, secondly, to apply that incomeas remittances. 42\"Searching for transparency: corruption and the global economy\", Multinational Monitor, vol. 27, No. 3 (May/June 2006) (see http://multinationalmonitor.org/mm2006/052006/interview-nussbaum.html).PART TWO. \u2014IMPACT 95Official remittances, money sent home by migrants, made up of millions of individual, pri- vate, non-market income transfers, have grown steadily and represent a significant inter-national flow of capital. Formal remittance flows from foreign workers now total over $232billion, with developing countries receiving $160 billion, while informal flows and nation-al or domestic remittances add 50 per cent more. 43Women, children and the elderly are said to be the majority of beneficiaries of these remittances. While the issue of foreignremittances themselves is controversial, any discussion on this topic must acknowledgethat, in the short term, they provide and make possible a number of benefits to those towhom they are sent. A direct impact of trafficking in persons is to deny a victim thosebenefits. Sending members abroad may represent many families' main survival project and source of income, with a much higher return than opportunities at home. Funds provided forhousehold needs enable receivers to maintain or increase expenditure on basic consump-tion and, in cases of extreme poverty, these funds will provide welfare assistance. 44 Remittances may also reduce the vulnerability of recipients to crises and be critical to howthey survive and recover from disasters. 45Sending remittances home also improves the status and negotiating power of women in their families and communities, and may cre-ate better conditions for other females in the family. 46This may create an effective devel- opment tool, contributing to the improvement of women's economic status in countriesof both origin and destination. 47 For many developing economies, remittances are the single largest source of foreignexchange and are stable and resilient in the face of economic downturns. Increasingly, itis argued that remittances are a positive force for development. They have been describedas the most stable, abundant and safe source of foreign aid for developing countries, 48 with greater efforts expended on how they can be used to assist development in recipi-ent countries, including their use in collective local development projects such as thoseset up in Mexico. 49According to the World Bank, a 10 per cent increase in the percent- age of remittances as a proportion of a country's GDP would result in a 1.6 per centreduction of the number of people living in poverty in that country. 50 43Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and World Bank, General Principles for International Remittance Services (Basel, Switzerland, Bank for International Settlements, 2007), p. 1 (see www.bis.org/publ/cpss76.pdf). 44Manuel Orozco, \"Remittances compete with the dream of an enterprise\", presentation at the Third International Policy and Expert Meeting \"Entrepreneurial decisions across borders: savings, remittances and investments and migranthousehold decisions\", The Hague, 22 November 2006, slide 7 (see http://www.remittances.eu/dmdocuments/Gender%20and%20remittances.ppt#270,19,Leveraging remittances forfinancial access). 45Kevin Savage and Paul Harvey, \"Remittances during crises: implications for humanitarian response\", Humanitarian Policy Group, Briefing paper No. 26 (London, Overseas Development Institute, May 2007) (see www.odi.org.uk/hpg/papers/hpgbrief26.pdf). 46Sarah J.

The fact that the profits oftrafficking derive from the exploitation of its victims, which may include keeping a greatpart of their earnings and thus preventing victims from sending remittances home or, atleast, reducing remittances, should have an impact on the benefits outlined above. D.\u2014The profits of organized crime In 2005, ILO estimated that there were 12.3 million people in forced labour worldwide, of whom about 2.4 million had been trafficked, both internally and across borders.51The profits of trafficking are significant. Unlike smuggling of migrants, which produces a one-timeprofit, trafficking involves the long-term exploitation of individuals, which translates into continuous income. Recent ILO estimates suggest that the global profits of trafficking inhuman beings are around $31.6 billion annually. Based on the previously cited numbers oftrafficked persons, this translates into an annual illicit profit of $13,000 per victim. 52 The International Monetary Fund assesses the annual turnover of criminal organizationsat some $1,500 billion internationally. 53Trafficking in persons is believed to be the third largest source of the profits for international organized crime after trafficking in drugs andarms. 54Trafficking in persons guarantees criminal networks a stable and regular source of income with little risk, enabling them to form additional rings for other lucrative and dangerous illicit activities. 55These profits have funded the expansion of international, regional and local criminal groups, contributed to corruption and undermined the rule oflaw. 56Information suggests that traffickers have effectively used the new opportunities created by changes in international restrictions on movements of goods, money and services, and the creation and development of new global markets and new technologies,to operate increasingly at the international level. 56 The structure and size of the organized criminal groups involved in human traffickingrange from small local networks to large transnational organizations. Those who benefitinclude recruiters, document forgers, brokers, brothel owners, debt collectors andmanagers/ owners of employment agencies. Corrupt immigration officials, consular workers, embassy personnel, members of law enforcement bodies and border guardsaccept bribes in exchange for passports, visas and safe transit. As a major global crime,human trafficking is also often intermixed with other organized illicit activities, including 51International Labour Office, A Global Alliance against Forced Labour: Global Report under the Follow-up to the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (Geneva, International Labour Office, 2005), pp. 11-14 (see www.ilo.org/dyn/declaris/DECLARATIONWEB.DOWNLOAD_BLOB?Var_DocumentID=5059). 52Patrick Belser, Forced Labour and Human Trafficking: Estimating the Profits, working paper (Geneva, International Labour Office, March 2005), p. 17 (see www.ilo.org/sapfl/Informationresources/ILOPublications/lang--en/docName--WCMS_081971/index.htm). 53North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Parliamentary Assembly, Subcommittee on Democratic Governance, Organised Crime: Drug and Human Trafficking in Europe, document 141 CCDG 03 E (NATO, 2003), para. 50 (see www.nato-pa.int/Default.asp?SHORTCUT=368) 54\"Human trafficking exposed\", Population Today, vol. 30, No. 1 (2002), pp. 1 and 4 (for Quotation see www.lib.msu.edu/harris23/crimjust/human.htm). 55North Atlantic Schloenhardt, Organised Crime and the Business of Migrant Trafficking: an Economic Analysis (Canberra, Australian Institute of Criminology, 10 November 1999), pp. 51 and 77 (see www.aic.gov.au/conferences/occasional/schloenhardt.html).PART TWO. \u2014IMPACT 97fraud, extortion, racketeering, money-laundering, bribery of public officials, drug use, doc- ument forgery and gambling.57 Of a global sample of 40 organized criminal groups surveyed by the United Nations Officeon Drugs and Crime in 2002, 8 were found to be involved in human trafficking activities,with 2 almost exclusively involved in human trafficking and the remaining 6 includinghuman trafficking as one of a number of diversified criminal activities undertaken by thegroup. 58In 50 per cent of human trafficking cases in one destination country, the perpetrators were also engaged in illegal trade in drugs or arms.59Links to other global criminal activities make human trafficking more profitable, as groups are able to use thesafe and tested routes and work through known corrupt officials. Human trafficking crimes are also closely integrated into legal business interests such as tourism, employment or recruitment agencies, agriculture, hotel and airline operations, andleisure and entertainment businesses. 60Criminal organizations may hide the traces of their illegal activities by directly and indirectly investing their profits in legitimate financial institutions. 61Although some businesses are simply established to launder money and not necessarily to make profits, this practice may in turn have a negative impact on the economy, as legitimate businesses may find themselves having to compete against enter-prises being secretly or unknowingly subsidised by laundered proceeds of crime or supported by the exploitation of trafficked persons. Fair competition may also be affectedwhen exploited trafficked persons have been used further down the supply chain to produce materials such as textiles. 62 The most visible impact of the profits of organized crime associated with human traffickingin destination countries is trafficking for sexual exploitation within the commercial sextrade. 63Well-established domestic organized criminal groups often engage in the sex trade and cheap labour markets with foreign counterparts.64Prostituted women have been known to be used as drug smugglers/couriers and dealers.65These crimes, combined with the movements of illicit profits made by the sex industry, estimated to be between $7 and$12 billion annually, 66have a significant impact on economic stability and security, human rights and law enforcement and crime control. 57James O.

Corruption and other ancillary crimes linked to trafficking activitiesundermine Governments, reduce accountability and representation in policymaking, suspend the rule of law and result in unequal service provision. The spread of organized crime, including human trafficking, has become, for example, one of the most important mechanisms for unlawful redistribution of national wealth in South-Eastern Europe. Organized crime undermines law enforcement efforts, slows economicgrowth, raises the cost of regional trade and disrupts the transition to a market economy.It has been suggested that profits from organized crime, in some parts of the globe, havebeen used as financial contributions to political parties and election campaigns. 67This has a negative impact on the public's trust in democratic and market economy institutionsand breeds disillusionment with reforms in general. In countries where there is civil unrest or where major natural disasters have occurred, the destruction of infrastructure means that Governments may have difficulty exercisingfull control over their national territory. For example, following natural disasters or as aresult of civil unrest, people housed in refugee camps or in temporary shelters, especia-lly children separated from their families and women alone, may be at risk from criminalorganizations and traffickers seeking to exploit their desperate circumstances. 68In these often chaotic circumstances, traffickers can undermine government efforts to exert author-ity and to protect vulnerable populations. Public safety may be threatened and communi-ties may lose faith in their national Governments, while international donors may bereluctant to provide aid in such circumstances. VI.\u2014Post-conflict situations In post-conflict areas, the association between international peacekeeping personnel and private contractors, organized crime and the growth of trafficking in women and childrenfor sexual exploitation has raised global concerns. 69It has been reported, for example, that during peacekeeping operations where significant human trafficking activity occurred,those who were trafficking in people also trafficked in guns and narcotics, the revenuefrom which could destabilize a theatre of operation. 70It has also been suggested that the 67Center for the Study of Democracy, Corruption, Contraband and Organized Crime in Southeast Europe (Sofia, 2003), p. 3 (see http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/UNTC/UNPAN016997.pdf). 68United Nations Population Fund, Gender-Based Violence in Aceh, Indonesia: a Case Study (New York, UNFPA), p. 11 (see www.unfpa.org/women/docs/gbv_indonesia.pdf).. 69Amnesty International, \"Kosovo (Serbia and Montenegro) 'So does that mean I have rights?'

For example, trafficking in per-sons is described in the European Security Strategy as one of the five key threats for theregion. 72Regional forums both within the European Union and in South-East Asia com- monly focus on developing collaborative efforts at addressing organized crime, includinglaw enforcement cooperation and training, and in combating human trafficking by target-ing migrant smugglers and human traffickers within a regional focus. The United Statesregards trafficking in persons as an important issue both because of its human impactand also because of its consequences for national security, primarily with respect to ter-rorism, crime, health and welfare, and border control. 73 In many countries, in particular in source areas, the prioritization of anti-human traffick-ing efforts must compete with a range of significant national concerns, including address-ing poverty, corruption and/or civil unrest, as well as competing demands for scarceresources. 74As evidenced by the ratification of the Trafficking Protocol, there is, howev- er, broad global agreement on the significant risks and harms that relate human traffick-ing issues to humanitarian concerns, business interests, political relationships, investmentsin training and assistance, and law enforcement cooperation. The proliferation of traffick-ing in persons and the organized crime associated with it is recognized as having a neg-ative impact on all these areas and undermining the effectiveness of aid and investment.There is also a consideration that organized crime networks involved in human traffick-ing may be a potential terrorism threat. 75 71Ibid., p. 25 72Volker Perthes, \"European perceptions, America's 'greater Middle , 9 March 2004 (see www.pogar.org/themes/reforms/documents/04e-eu-perceptions.pdf). 73United States, Department of Homeland Security, written statement of John P.

As a major component of organized crime with its enormous financial power,trafficking in persons has a complex and interlocking negative impact across human, social,political and economic arenas. The destabilizing and dangerous consequences range from readily recognized violence, direct economic loss and major migration concerns to the less easily quantified, equallyserious, but more complex effects of risks and harms to environmental, social, health andsafety, and violations of human rights. Trafficking in persons directly challenges the devel-opment of stable, more prosperous societies and legitimate economies, and works stronglyagainst the reconciliation of political interests with humanitarian and human rights obli-gations. The range of trafficking-related crimes and their broad and interrelated impactshave created a cumulative threat to global peace, security and stability and have shapedpolitical, social and economic responses at both national and global levels.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTIONPART THREE Action 103Responses to trafficking in persons: international norms translated intoaction at the national and regional levels Mike Dottridge I.\u2014Translating international instruments into action The adoption in November 2000 of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United NationsConvention against Transnational Organized Crime, precipitated intense activity aroundthe world to stop trafficking in persons. This paper summarizes the principal responsesundertaken by States parties. Their main focus has been on detecting and prosecutingtraffickers, identifying, protecting and assisting people who have already been traffickedand initiating action to prevent people from being trafficked in the first place. Relativelylarge amounts of money have been invested in these anti-trafficking efforts by a range ofdonors. A.\u2014Legislation Many States that have ratified the Trafficking Protocol (and some that have not) have adopted new laws or amended existing legislation to translate the Protocol into action atthe national level, to define an offence of trafficking in persons along the lines of the def-inition contained in the Protocol, to increase penalties for traffickers and to establish insti-tutions and procedures to implement the law. Numerous agreements and declarations havealso been adopted at the regional level on the issue of trafficking in persons. Some arebased on the definition of trafficking contained in the Protocol. 1Others focus only on commercial sexual exploitation2and do not consider people who have been trafficked into forced labour or servitude. Some focus exclusively on cases of trafficking involving womenand girls. 3 1Such as the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (Council of Europe, Treaty Series, No. 197) (2005) (see http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/197.htm). 2Such as the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution (2002) (see http://www.saarc-sec.org/old/freepubs/conv-traffik-ing.pdf). 3Such as the Council of Europe, Parliamentary Assembly, recommendation 1545 (2002) on a campaign against trafficking in women (see http://assembly.coe.int/Main.asp?link=/Documents/AdoptedText/ta02/EREC1545.htm).AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 104Article 3 of the Trafficking Protocol specifies a non-exhaustive range of purposes of exploitation that are associated with trafficking (\"at a minimum, the exploitation of theprostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slav-ery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs\"). When adoptingnew laws, some States have made a distinction between \"sexual exploitation\" (such as theexploitation of the prostitution of others and forced marriage) and \"labour exploitation\"(i.e. forced labour and servitude). 4 Several countries facing considerable instances of child trafficking, such as Benin, haveincorporated the concept of \"worst forms of child labour\" in their legislation on humantrafficking. 5This is based on the definitions in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention No. 182, the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, and includes formsof exploitation not covered by the Trafficking Protocol. The Trafficking Protocol is quitespecific in its definitions that, when a child is recruited or transported, the illegal means(\"threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception,of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving ofpayments or benefits\") mentioned in article 3, subparagraph (a), are irrelevant for the case to constitute trafficking. 6However, in some countries new legislation does not reflect this provision, meaning that investigators must be able to show that children under 18 havebeen subjected to the same forms of abusive control as adults while being recruited ortransported for their cases to be categorized as trafficking. Further, some countries definea child as being under 15 or 16 years of age rather than 18. The net result of the varied ways in which States have amended their legislation is that representatives of one State, when referring to a case of human trafficking in communi-cations with representatives of another State, may not be referring to the same practices.This result clearly contradicts the intentions of the Trafficking Protocol. It also means that,when collecting data about cases of trafficking in persons, there are still no common cri-teria, so that States that have similar trafficking patterns may issue public information thatsuggests that the patterns in the two countries are quite different. All States that have rati-fied the Trafficking Protocol should therefore review their legislation surrounding bothtrafficking and the various forms of exploitation prohibited by the Protocol to ensure thatthey are in compliance with its provisions. They can use a United Nations Office on Drugsand Crime assessment tool to assess their compliance. 7For example, one State in Latin America which ratified the Trafficking Protocol in 2004 faced difficulties when the legis- 4As debt bondage is a form of servitude, in principle any irregular migrant who has to work for a specified employer to pay back an extortionate loan (to finance his or her travel expenses) can be regarded as trafficked. Inpractice, this interpretation is sometimes contentious, as some migrants argue that it is legitimate to take such loans(and repay the substantial interest by working), as they have little access to alternative sources to finance their migration. 5Benin, Loi N\u00b0 2006-04 du 5 avril 2006 portant sur les conditions de d\u00e9placement des mineurs et la r\u00e9pression de B\u00e9nin (see of the Trafficking Protocol specifies: \"The recruitment ... or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation shall be considered 'trafficking in persons' even if this does not involve any of the meansset forth in subparagraph (a) of this article\". 7United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, \"Anti-trafficking assessment tool: a tool for rapidly assessing jurisdictional concordance with the requirements of UN Trafficking Protocol and the UN Convention againstTransnational Organized Crime\", 2003.PART THREE. \u2014ACTION 105lature adopted an anti-trafficking law in 2005 that was not consistent with the terms of the Protocol. The Head of State attempted to resolve the inconsistencies by promulgatinga national policy to combat human trafficking in 2006, which clearly addresses all theforms of exploitation mentioned in the Trafficking Protocol. B.\u2014Institutions to combat trafficking States have established a variety of specialized institutions to respond to cases of traffick- ing in persons. Sometimes these institutions are defined in the State's anti-trafficking leg-islation, while sometimes they are defined separately. These institutions vary widely andinclude national rapporteurs (on trafficking), inter-ministerial or inter-agency coordinationbodies or mechanisms, bodies to coordinate the provision of services to individuals whohave been trafficked (sometimes called national referral mechanisms) and special lawenforcement units, as well as specialized prosecutors to detect and prosecute traffickers.In some cases it has been left to a national human rights institution to propose new ini-tiatives, as in India. 8 C.\u2014Learning what works: good practice The past seven years have been an opportunity to learn which approaches are effective and which are not. Not all the investment has yielded the intended results. Some initia-tives turned out to be counterproductive for the very people they were intended to ben-efit. Some prove not to work when scaled up or replicated in different places. Althoughthere has been a considerable amount of systematic learning, much remains to be learnedabout what constitutes good practice and how to assess the circumstances in which par-ticular techniques can be replicated successfully. 8India's 455-page Report on Trafficking in Women and Children in India: 2002-2003 (New Delhi, 2004) was compiled by the country's National Human Rights Commission, in conjunction with India's Institute of Social Sciencesand the United Nations Development Fund for Women.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 106II.\u2014Working together Traffickers routinely move their victims from one place to another either within a coun- try or abroad. Consequently, any effective response to trafficking requires the collabora-tion of multiple agencies, often in two or more countries. Progress has been made inimproving coordination between separate agencies over the past seven years, at the local,national, regional and international levels. A.\u2014At the national level States with a national structure to coordinate anti-trafficking initiatives (such as a natio- nal referral mechanism) or a national plan to combat trafficking or a national action planor programme have an institutional framework for ensuring cooperation between agencieswithin their country. In the absence of a designated coordinating body, concerted actionagainst trafficking has been slower to develop and coordination between different agen-cies in the country less easy. These various coordination mechanisms specify the rolesand responsibilities of different agencies. They are particularly helpful in cases when anindividual has been identified as a victim of trafficking and requires referral to variousagencies for different forms of assistance. 9 In some countries mechanisms for referring victims of trafficking to appropriate servicesalso function at the local level. This enables locally based agencies to coordinate theirefforts to protect people who have already been trafficked with their prevention effortsand to target prevention on individuals, households or communities that share character-istics with those already trafficked, that is to say, characteristics that appear to increasethe likelihood that they might be trafficked. B.\u2014At the bilateral level between two States Various States have signed bilateral agreements on law enforcement cooperation and mutual legal assistance. Others specify how citizens from one State who have been trafficked toanother are to be treated and assisted in returning home. These agreements generallyemphasize the importance of respecting the human rights of the trafficked persons inorder to avoid their being imprisoned, to ensure that they are protected and kept safewhile being repatriated, and to continue protecting them upon arrival in their own coun-try. Some agreements refer to women and children, such as one between Cambodia andThailand, while others refer solely to children, such as one between C\u00f4te d'Ivoire andMali. Despite the existence of such bilateral agreements, many people trafficked or exploited in States that are parties to bilateral agreements have not been identified as victims ofcrime and have instead been dealt with as irregular migrants, denied protection and assis- 9The role of national referral mechanisms in States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is set out in the publication National Referral Mechanisms: Joining Efforts to Protect the Rights of Trafficked Persons: a Practical Handbook (Warsaw, 2004) (see http://www.osce.org/odihr/documents.html).PART THREE. \u2014ACTION 107tance, and subjected to summary deportation procedures. In other cases, as in parts of South-East Asia, long delays in official repatriation procedures have reportedly led to vic-tims choosing not to identify themselves as such in order to return home more rapidlyby being deported. C.\u2014At the regional level, involving several States Regional intergovernmental organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and theOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) have adopted either decla-rations against trafficking or more action-oriented plans to improve cooperation and coor-dination of their member States' efforts to stop trafficking. The ECOWAS secretariat issuedan Initial Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons (2002-2003) and, jointly with theEconomic Community of Central African States, a Joint Plan of Action against Traffickingin Persons, especially Women and Children in West and Central Africa for 2006-2009, 10 while ASEAN's Senior Officials Meeting on Transnational Crime was responsible for following up a declaration, concentrating on criminal justice systemresponses to trafficking. 11The OSCE Permanent Council issued a detailed OSCE Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings for all participating States in 2003.12 Declarations by themselves do not lead to change, however. In all the examples cited,implementation of the full range of commitments has been extremely uneven. In the case of the six-country Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative against Trafficking (COMMIT) in South-East Asia, 13the six States involved adopted a memorandum of under- standing on cooperation against trafficking in persons in the Greater Mekong subregionin 2004. In 2005, they adopted a three-year subregional plan of action (2005-2007), listing18 activities to be undertaken on seven issues. Although not all of these have been imple-mented, cooperation was facilitated by a pre-existing United Nations initiative to coordi-nate anti-trafficking initiatives by intergovernmental organizations and internationalnon-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the subregion, the United Nations Inter-Agency Project on Human Trafficking in the Greater Mekong Subregion. In this region,as in others, the specific responsibilities of the States taking part in a common initiativeare made more complicated by their participation in several overlapping regional initia-tives (i.e. ASEAN, COMMIT and others), each of which emphasizes different techniquesor activities. In the European Union (EU), concerted initiatives to harmonize anti-trafficking efforts began in the 1990s. In 2002 a Council framework decision on combating trafficking in 10The Economic Community of West African States Declaration and Plan of Action are described in the publi- cation Assistance for the Implementation of the ECOWAS Plan of Action against Trafficking in Persons: Training Manual (New York, United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2006) (see http://www.unodc.org). 11Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN Responses to Trafficking: Ending Impunity for Traffickers and Securing Justice for Victims (Jakarta, ASEAN, 2006), p. 1. 12Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Permanent Council decision No. 557, entitled \"OSCE Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings\", of 24 July 2003 (PC.DEC/557) (see www.osce.org/press_rel/2003/pdf_documents/07-3447-pc1.pdf). 13The six States of COMMIT are Cambodia, China, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam. (For details about COMMIT, see http://www.fmreview.org/text/FMR/25/10.doc).AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 108human beings specified minimum standards for member States' responses to trafficking. A conference jointly organized by the European Commission and the InternationalOrganization for Migration (IOM) in September 2002 adopted the Brussels Declarationon Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, accompanied by a set of rec-ommendations on standards and best practices. The European Commission subsequentlyestablished a 20-member Experts Group on Trafficking in Human Beings, which issued areport in December 2004 making 132 recommendations for further measures to be takenby EU member States. 14 At the regional and international levels, numerous training materials and reference guide-lines have been published to inform and train a wide range of government, law enforce-ment and other professionals about what they can do in response to trafficking. Thematerials are mostly in English and relatively few have been translated into national lan-guages. Consistency in the contents of such materials is not guaranteed. D.\u2014At the international level 1.\u2014The United Nations system Many United Nations entities run programmes to combat trafficking.15In addition, an intergovernmental organization that does not belong to the United Nations system, IOM,plays an important role in providing services to trafficked persons and organizing theirvoluntary repatriation. At both the international and the regional level, it is often unclearwhether one of these bodies is taking the lead or coordinating the actions of others, orif a national or regional body assumes that role. Even when it is clear in theory, in prac-tice separate bodies appear to be in competition. Trafficking in persons is a multidimensional problem that raises issues that many differ- ent bodies are equipped to tackle at the national and international levels. Law enforce-ment, human rights, economic development, gender, migration and health are all relevant.Many different intergovernmental agencies see themselves as having a leading role. Similarcoordination challenges occurred in the case of child labour and efforts were made toresolve them at two international conferences in 1997. In a study of child trafficking, anNGO observed that the lack of coordination between different organizations within theUnited Nations system was hampering the effectiveness of their efforts. It suggested that: 16 14European Commission, Directorate-General Justice, Freedom and Security, Report of the Experts Group on Trafficking in Human Beings (Brussels, 2004) (see http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/doc_centre/crime/trafficking/ doc_crime_human_trafficking_en.htm#Experts%20Group%20on%20Trafficking%20in%20Human%20Beings). 15United Nations entities working in the area of human trafficking include the International Labour Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Development Fund for Women, the Division for theAdvancement of Women of the Secretariat, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, theUnited National Office on Drugs and Crime, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations DevelopmentProgramme, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the United National InterregionalCrime and Justice Research Institute, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights andthe United Nations Institute for Training and Research. 16Mike Dottridge, Kids as Commodities?

In 2005, the United Nations System's Chief for Coordination recognized the challenges in countering human trafficking and proposed establishing an inter-agency mechanism tostrengthen coordination. 17 2.\u2014Bilateral funding Many industrialized States fund anti-trafficking initiatives in other countries, especially in those countries from which people have been trafficked into their country or region. Theeffectiveness of the financial support provided by bilateral donors has sometimes beenundermined when many donors have committed relatively small amounts separately todiverse projects, rather than pooling their contributions. While these small amounts haveproduced some results, they are usually inadequate for more systemic solutions, such asan initial needs assessment or the collection of adequate data about the abuse that a sub-sequent intervention aims to stop. The interventions that are supported benefit in largepart because of the goals of the organization that secures funding and the preoccupationsof the donor (for example, preferring their funds to assist children rather than adultwomen), rather than as a result of any objective assessment of needs. Inadequate fund-ing has also resulted in insufficient evaluation and impact assessment, meaning that les-sons about which techniques are effective (and which are not) are not learned properly. 17United States of America, Government Accountability Office, Human Trafficking: Monitoring and Evaluation of International Projects are Limited, but Experts Suggest Improvements, GAO report GAO-07-1034 (Washington, D.C., July 2007) p. 11.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 110III. Prosecution and law enforcement activities Expertise about techniques to detect traffickers, identify and care for their victims and prosecute traffickers successfully has increased significantly since 2000. Reports of thearrest and conviction of traffickers are frequent. Nevertheless, trafficking in persons is stillreported to be one of the most profitable sectors of organized transnational crime, sug-gesting that numerous traffickers go undetected or unpunished. Comparing the numberof prosecutions with the number of identified victims shows major gaps. It is often saidthat the number of identified victims represents the tip of the iceberg and that large num-bers of trafficked persons pass unnoticed under the noses of law enforcement officials.In the worst cases they are identified as criminals rather than as victims of crime. Confusion among both civil servants and law enforcement officials about the difference between trafficking in persons and smuggling of migrants or other immigration-relatedoffences has marred the progress of law enforcement initiatives in many countries.Considerable funds have been invested in training at both international and national lev-els. One challenge is that it is not sufficient for one part of the criminal justice system(for example, the personnel in an anti-trafficking police unit) to understand the distinc-tion if other parts, such as frontline police, prosecutors or court personnel organizing trials (where in-court protection measures are often required to protect the identity of victim-witnesses), have not. A specific obstacle still to be overcome is that some training courses present simplistic examples to show the differences between trafficking and smug-gling of migrants that are not representative of the complications encountered at the oper-ational level, when victims may be unwilling to talk to law enforcement officials abouttheir experiences for weeks or even months. There have been efforts to develop minimum standards concerning the response of crim- inal justice systems to trafficking cases. In 2006, ASEAN issued a checklist for its mem-ber countries identifying eight key elements of an effective criminal justice response totrafficking, 18which are, in principle, equally applicable to other parts of the world. They emphasize that, because of the complexity of the crime, it is usually appropriate to forma specialist anti-trafficking investigation unit and that it is important to have effective sys-tems in place to ensure that the criminal justice agencies in one country can cooperatewith counterpart agencies in other countries. They also emphasize that, if the criminal jus-tice system is to function effectively, it is important to identify victims of trafficking quicklyand accurately, to protect them from harm and meet their immediate needs. The checklist moved the focus off the number of successful prosecutions as the prime indicator of suc-cess in combating trafficking, as this could encourage a lack of due process and the tar-geting of small-scale traffickers rather than major criminals. 18Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN Responses to Trafficking ... , p. 85.PART THREE. \u2014ACTION 111A.\u2014Identifying trafficked persons A major challenge for immigration and law enforcement officials is how to distinguish trafficking victims from others they come into contact with, who may be involved in similar income-generating activities, but who have not been trafficked. Numerous toolshave been developed at frontiers and for police forces to aid identification. With good intelligence about the profile of adults or children who have already been trafficked, police have identified the characteristics of such persons and used this intelli-gence to pick out travellers who warrant advice and protection. 19For example, the Philippine Centre on Transnational Crime developed an 11-point checklist to help iden-tify such people and a further 11-point checklist to identify possible traffickers. 20 Unannounced operations or raids by law enforcement officials are a way of removing individuals who are held in captivity by their traffickers or exploiters from the site of theirexploitation. In the course of some raids, both trafficking victims and others have expe-rienced further trauma. The Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions hasrecommended the development of procedural guidelines for raids and rescues to ensurethat the human rights of trafficking victims are protected, emphasizing that raids shouldnot occur without adequate planning for the subsequent protection and support of traf-ficked people. 21Clearly, it is important that the use of raids on places where trafficked individuals might be located, in the absence of actual intelligence, should be carefully mon-itored by senior law enforcement officials and human rights institutions, in particular toensure that the techniques used are proportional to the abuse they are intended to stop. B.\u2014Interceptions at frontiers Border posts offer an opportunity to identify victims of transnational trafficking and to intercept them. The potential role of immigration officials is greater where traffickers taketheir victims through an official border point. It is more difficult to control the movementof people along long land or sea borders, whether they be regular travellers or traffickers 19In the Netherlands, the Criminal Investigation Division developed a system in 2002 for recording information about individuals suspected of being trafficked into prostitution, as well as known victims. The system awards pointsin an individual case, according to a list of indicators suggested by the prosecution service and police (see A. vanden Borne and others, Investigating Exploitation: Research into Trafficking in Children in the Netherlands (Amsterdam, Defence for Children International, 2005), p. 31. In the United Kingdom, \"Operation Paladin Child\" in 2004 involvedrecording the personal details of every child arriving at a border post in the United Kingdom who was assessed aspossibly being at risk (of being trafficked or exploited), so that the child could be visited subsequently by social serv-ices staff. Each arriving child was given a unique identifying number, had his or her photograph taken and was askedto say where he or she would be living in the United Kingdom. Details of adults welcoming unaccompanied childrenat airports or ports were also recorded. If the child could not be located at the address given, an investigation wasreportedly opened. Details can be found in the monthly magazine of the Metropolitan Police, The Job, vol. 38, No.953 (May 2005). 20Quoted in tool 6.3, entitled \"Checklist to facilitate the identification of victims\" (see United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Toolkit to Combat Trafficking in Persons (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.06.V.11)) (seewww.unodc.org/pdf/Trafficking_toolkit_Oct06.pdf). 21Asia Pacific Forum of National Human Rights Institutions, Regional Workshop on Human Trafficking and National Human Rights Institutions: Cooperating to End Impunity for Traffickers and to Secure Justice for Trafficked People, Sydney, Australia, 20 23 November 2005 (see http://www.asiapacificforum.net/services/training/regional-workshops/traffick-ing/downloads/conclusion/report.pdf).AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 112and their victims. Border police and immigration officials in some countries have devel- oped criteria to help identify victims. Some have been over-simplistic and potentially resultin discrimination against entire categories of people who share very general characteris-tics. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) developed a checklist for immigra-tion officers (border officials) to assess whether a child is at risk of being trafficked, whichlists seven indicators to show that a child might be in the process of being trafficked. 22 C. Increasing the effectiveness of prosecutions by using victim- friendly techniques In the midst of efforts to enhance the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies to com- bat trafficking, tensions have arisen between initiatives designed to enforce the law, onthe one hand, and other initiatives designed to uphold the human rights of adults andchildren who are trafficked, on the other. This need not be the case. Evidence suggeststhat the prompt identification and appropriate treatment of victims is crucial to an effec-tive criminal justice response. In 2002, the Office of the United Nations HighCommissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) issued a set of Recommended Principlesand Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking, emphasizing that the humanrights of trafficked persons should be at the centre of all efforts to prevent and combattrafficking and to protect, assist and provide redress to victims. 23 Critics have harshly addressed procedures that make assistance to trafficked persons andany form of residence permit conditional on cooperation with the criminal justice system. 24 Substantial evidence is now available indicating that women and girls who have been traf-ficked are not in a position to make informed choices about their future within a shorttime of being withdrawn from the control of traffickers, or for some time afterwards, whilethey are suffering from shock or trauma. 25 Numerous States have adopted what are commonly known as \"reflection periods\" for traf-ficked persons identified within their borders and who have no legal entitlement to be inthe country. The length of time granted to foreign victims to recover and reflect on whetherthey wish to cooperate with law enforcement vary widely, from a few days to severalmonths. In some States both victims and other witnesses who can potentially testify againsttraffickers are awarded only a short-term right to remain in the country concerned. Oneimplication of this is that trafficked persons are left feeling very insecure about theirfutures. Different criminal justice systems have tried a variety of techniques to reduce the 22United Nations Children's Fund, Reference Guide on Protecting the Rights of Child Victims of Trafficking in Europe (Geneva, UNICEF, 2006), p. 115 (see http://www.unicef.org/ceecis/protection_4440.html). 23Principle 1 of the Recommended Principles contained in the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (E/2002/68/Add.1). 24Elaine Pearson, Human Traffic, Human Rights: Redefining Victim Protection (London, Anti-Slavery International, 2002). 25Cathy Zimmerman and others, Stolen Smiles: a Summary Report on the Physical and Psychological Health Consequences of Women and Adolescents Trafficked in Europe (London, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 2006) (see www.lshtm.ac.uk/genderviolence/).PART THREE. \u2014ACTION 113likelihood that victims and witnesses are exposed to further intimidation, either before, during or after a trial. The consequences for victims and witnesses who have providedprosecution evidence to help secure the conviction of traffickers have not been monitoredsystematically. One important initiative overlooked in many jurisdictions has been toensure that victims and witnesses testifying against traffickers are updated regularly aboutthe progress of the trial. In unfortunate cases, victims have come face to face with theirtrafficker, while believing him or her to still be in prison. Criminal justice systems have given less priority to awarding compensation or damages to victims than to securing the conviction of traffickers. The result is that victim-witness-es do not believe that justice has been served. Instances in which individuals harmed bytraffickers have been paid compensation, damages or unpaid wages remain rare. Bringingsuch cases has been hard for victims of transnational trafficking who were obliged to leavethe country of destination before a case came to court. In other cases, the converse istrue, with victims required to stay in the destination country for an unacceptably longtime if they wish to pursue a case. D.\u2014Mutual legal assistance to facilitate prosecutions The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, adopted in 2000, is intended to promote cooperation to prevent and combat transnational organized crimemore effectively. Along the same lines, one of the purposes of its supplementary TraffickingProtocol is to promote cooperation among States parties to prevent and combat traffick-ing in persons, as well as protect and assist the victims of such trafficking. In this con-text, the provisions of the Convention concerning international cooperation in criminalmatters, including extradition and mutual legal assistance, also apply to the TraffickingProtocol and can be used to facilitate cooperation between relevant agencies in differentStates to detect cases of trafficking, collect evidence against traffickers and bring them tojustice. These provisions can also be used to facilitate cooperation in order to freeze, seizeand confiscate traffickers' assets when these are located abroad. Broader use of the inter-national cooperation provisions of the Convention, coupled with bilateral and multilater-al agreements or arrangements to enhance the effectiveness of relevant mechanisms, arerecommended to ensure that an appropriate legal framework is in place to pursue traf-fickers. Although the efficiency of international cooperation depends on the existence oflegal tools, practical experience has shown that this is not enough. What has also to bein place is a sufficient number of well-trained personnel, together with the appropriateresources that help overcome the practical problems arising from operational deficienciesand bureaucratic obstacles, which often hamper cooperation. Moreover, meeting and work-ing with the representatives of the criminal justice system in other countries helps fostermutual trust and confidence\u2014an important precondition for efficient cooperation.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 114IV.\u2014Prevention Despite the saying that \"prevention is better than a cure\", the lack of certainty about which preventive techniques are effective appears to have discouraged donors from investing inprevention. Where funds have been invested in prevention initiatives, there has been insuf-ficient evaluation of the techniques used to assess which are most appropriate in partic-ular circumstances. Furthermore, until better systems are developed to collate existinginformation about where and how victims were trafficked, there is a limited basis on whichto locate and target prevention initiatives. The factors that contribute to trafficking or enable it to take place (all of which can be tackled by prevention programmes) occur at different levels and in different places. Inaddition to the immediate causes that put an individual into the hands of a trafficker, avariety of underlying and root causal factors influence decisions taken by individuals thatlead to trafficking and contribute to a social and economic environment in which trafficking and exploitation can flourish. They include, for example, an economic crisis inthe trafficked person's home country, social exclusion, gender discrimination (both in general and specifically in relation to births, as female infanticide in several countries hasresulted in an excess of men of marriageable age over women and precipitated patternsof trafficking in women into forced marriage) and a weak legal or social protection system. The remedies for these require a broader set of actions than those designed specifically to stop trafficking. Relevant factors exist simultaneously in the areas that people are trafficked from and in the places to which they are trafficked and exploited.\"Poverty\" has frequently been identified as a cause of trafficking. In practice, most people in dire poverty are not trafficked, demonstrating that poverty is a context, but notthe specific cause. A study of the circumstances in which girls migrated and were trafficked into the commercial sex industry within one South-East Asian country identified the social and cultural reasons why certain adolescents were recruited and notothers. The author urged that: 26 \"Academics and policymakers must move beyond 'poverty' and 'lack of education'to recognize the subtleties of the challenges and frustrations confronting people liv-ing in the less developed parts of our rapidly developing world.\" A.\u2014Prevention in areas of origin Prevention efforts in areas of origin have addressed a wide range of causal factors, some linked to the specific circumstances that precipitated individuals into the control of traffickers and some addressing shortcomings in protection systems. Prevention effortscan take several forms. The bulk of these activities use information to alert people to therisks entailed in leaving home or seeking work abroad (or to alert parents to the riskstheir children run, if they are sent to work elsewhere). Alongside awareness-raising, a 26L. Rende Taylor, \"Dangerous trade-offs: the behavioral ecology of child labor and prostitution in rural northern Thailand\", Current Anthropology , vol. 46, No. 3 (June 2005).PART THREE. \u2014ACTION 115second category of efforts has focused on promoting income-generating activities in areas from which people are trafficked, including microcredit, job creation and career advice.However, in such cases insufficient attention has been given to ensuring that the individ-uals at highest risk of being trafficked benefit. Many initiatives assume that increasingincome-generating opportunities in a community as a whole or improving women's incomein general will be sufficient to reduce emigration and trafficking. Unless there has beenprior research to identify the salient characteristics of the individuals being trafficked froma particular community and to understand the social and cultural reasons for their vulner-ability, it is unlikely that microcredit or similar schemes will directly benefit the categoriesof people who are at highest risk of being trafficked or reduce the numbers of traffickedpersons. The need for such research is further explained in section VI.B below. A third set of prevention efforts focus on formal and non-formal education, including teaching life skills to young people. 27A fourth set target groups of people known to be at disproportionately high risk of being trafficked. For this approach to be evidence-based,research has to be carried out among people who have already been trafficked in orderto identify any salient characteristics that distinguish them from others in similar circum-stances who have not been trafficked. Sometimes it appears to be their identity (theybelong to a particular ethnic group), while in others it was a particular experience (suchas domestic abuse) or a lack of education or skills. Research in areas of origin has also identified weaknesses in social protection systems, which have been addressed by a fourth set of measures, strengthening social protection.In the case of children, in parts of South-Eastern Europe multidisciplinary teams havebeen established, consisting of a team of professionals, such as social workers, health professionals and law enforcement officials, who work together to identify children at riskand implement measures to protect them. Similar research has identified gaps that couldbe covered by administrative controls, such as the regulation and monitoring of agenciesthat have been used by traffickers to recruit people into various forms of exploitation,both ordinary recruitment agencies (both private ones and sometimes government-run)and those dealing with au pairs, marriage, entertainment and tourism. Giving every individual a legal identity is essential if administrative controls are to function, so birthregistration or other procedures to register the existence of individuals, their personal dataand their nationality are all important. Raising awareness about trafficking in persons The assumption behind disseminating information to prevent trafficking is that peoplewho are trafficked are under-informed about the risks involved in migration or the poten-tial risks involved in accepting informal offers of employment away from home. In partic-ular, many of these programmes have been directed to young women, notably those atrisk of being trafficked for purposes of sexual exploitation. The expectation is usually thatthe recipients of information will decide not to take the risks involved (and stay at home) 27Life skills include learning to negotiate and take decisions, problem-solving, critical thinking, communicating effectively, managing interpersonal relationships, resolving conflicts and coping with emotions and stress.AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 116or take adequate precautions to avoid traffickers. Materials that stress the dangers awaiting potential migrants and warn people against leaving home are reportedly perceivedby some audiences to be untrustworthy anti-migration propaganda. 28Some have been produced without adequate research beforehand to find out how and why people makedecisions to migrate and to check whether they are indeed under-informed or choose totake risks because of the challenges they face and a lack of alternatives. The formats for awareness-raising materials and the message they convey vary. They include films telling semi-fictional stories about adolescent girls or young women who havebeen trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation. Despite the expense involved in pro-ducing these and countless posters, leaflets and cartoons, there have been relatively fewevaluations of their impact or efforts to learn systematically from experience and improvetheir effectiveness next time around. 29Indeed, too many have been \"off-the-peg\" campaigns, based on similar initiatives in other countries, without being tailored to the needs and cir-cumstances of the audience they are trying to influence. Increasingly, anti-trafficking information materials are advising potential migrants instead how they can minimize risks by taking precautions. For example, in Latvia, NGOs gaveadolescents a checklist of actions to protect themselves against false job promises abroad,included checking whether a job agency or opportunity was legitimate, seeking an employ-ment contract and leaving a copy with relatives or friends. 30 B.\u2014Interceptions of those in transit In addition to interceptions of persons by immigration officials at border points, when there is evidence that they are being trafficked, the technique of intercepting people hasbeen used in a variety of other circumstances to try and prevent people from being traf-ficked. The disadvantage of this technique is that the criteria used for identifying possi-ble trafficking victims have generally been far too general and the interceptions have endedup becoming a form of abuse. Interceptions have been widely criticized in West Africa,where concern about children being trafficked into forced labour at the end of the 1990sprompted several Governments to establish village-level \"vigilance\" committees, ostensiblyto prevent children from being trafficked. As the distinction between trafficking and otherforms of migration was not well understood by committee members or law enforcementofficials, they are reported to have intercepted adolescents who wanted to leave home toseek work elsewhere and obliged them to return home, including older adolescents whowere entitled by both national law and international standards to seek employment. 31 28Barbara Limanowska, Trafficking in Human Beings in South Eastern Europe: 2004 - Focus on Prevention in Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, Serbia andMontenegro and the UN Administered Province of Kosovo, joint report by the United Nations Children's Fund, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Office for Democratic Institutions and HumanRights of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (New York, United Nations DevelopmentProgramme, 2005), p. 31. 29Ruth Rosenberg and others, Best Practices for Programming to Prevent Trafficking in Human Beings in Europe and Eurasia (Bethesda, Maryland, Development Alternatives Inc., 2004)(see http://www.vitalvoices.org/files/docs/Prevention%20assessment%20Report-formatted%20CAS1.pdf). 30Alison Boak and others, eds., Smooth Flight: a Guide to Preventing Youth Trafficking (International Organization for Adolescents, 2003), p. 95 (see http://www.seerights.org). 31S.

(London, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 2003).PART THREE. \u2014ACTION 117C.\u2014Prevention in areas where trafficked persons are exploited Industrialized States to which people are trafficked have invested money principally in prevention in the countries from which such people come, but different forms of preven-tion have also been undertaken in the places where exploitation occurs. The immigrationand employment policies pursued by States to which significant numbers of people aretrafficked also have a significant impact, sometimes increasing the likelihood that irregu-lar migrants end up in the hands of traffickers. 1.\u2014Employment laws concerning migrant workers in the informal sector As much of the exploitation to which trafficked persons are subjected occurs in the less regulated informal economy, one technique for reducing such exploitation is to check forabuse in sectors of employment that have formerly gone unpoliced, either by makingemployment laws applicable in sectors such as domestic work in private houses or deploy-ing labour inspectors or other officials to check the contracts and working conditions ofmigrant workers. Of course, this technique only works if it is clear that the officials con-cerned are dedicated to detecting workplace abuse, rather than immigration offences. InThailand, for example, ILO worked with the authorities to amend provisions of the LabourProtection Act that excluded certain categories of workers from labour protection (suchas domestic workers). 32 2.\u2014Regulation of recruitment in sectors where trafficking victims are found Likewise, as unregulated recruitment practices have resulted in migrants being tricked and subjected to forced labour in numerous countries (that is to say, they have been traf-ficked), improved oversight or regulation of recruitment practices is a way of preventingtrafficking. For example, after reports in 2003 that temporary workers in the agriculturaland food-processing sectors in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Irelandwere being subjected to abuse, including forced labour and violence, and that existingcontrols on labour providers, known as \"gangmasters\", were ineffective, the Governmentintroduced a new form of regulation. The Gangmasters (Licensing) Act, passed in 2004,created a compulsory licensing system for all employment agents supplying workers foragricultural activities, gathering shellfish and related processing and packaging activities,supervised by a special licensing authority. 33 32See Mariska N.

Facilities for migrants that protect them from abuse While some trafficking victims are under the control of traffickers from the time they leave home onwards, many others fall under their control later on, sometimes after arriving ata destination where they intend to find work. For many decades, some countries havemade a range of facilities available to recently arrived migrants, in particular migrantwomen and children, which have helped keep them out of the control of criminals whowould abuse them. These include safe accommodation and drop-in centres where recentmigrants can obtain advice and information, such as those established in Kunming, thecapital of China's Yunnan Province. 34 4. Using the law to tackle demand for the labour or services of trafficked persons In the last few years there has been debate about what preventive action is effective in reducing \"demand\" in places where trafficked people are exploited. This means implement-ing measures that are likely to reduce demand for products made by trafficked personsand services provided by them, which may subsequently result in fewer people being trafficked. In her 2006 report to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, the then Special Rapporteur on Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Sigma Huda, exam-ined whether people who paid for the services of trafficking victims could be influencedto reduce the numbers of trafficked persons. It is notable that the treatment of demandas it relates to sex trafficking is somewhat different from that for other forms of exploita-tion and the Special Rapporteur's report focused on demand for commercial sex, conclud-ing that prostitution was inextricably linked to human trafficking and that demand forcommercial sex was tantamount to demand for the services of trafficked women and girls.She recommended that prostitution not be legalized or decriminalized. 35This contrasted with comments by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and con-sequences, Radhika Coomaraswamy, who in 2000 criticized efforts to abolish prostitutionby targeting and punishing third-party involvement. This Rapporteur noted that, althoughtargeting third parties such as men and boys who paid for sex appeared in theory to pro-tect women sex workers from being penalized, in practice women had suffered \"the bur-den of criminalization\", even when laws were intended primarily to target procurers, pimpsand men and boys who paid for sex. 36While proponents on both sides of the debate hold tenaciously to their convictions, there remains no conclusive link between legalization orcriminalization of prostitution and the existence of trafficking for sexual exploitation.Further research is needed on this topic. 34International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) Task Team of the Yunnan Provincial Statistics Bureau, The Mekong Challenge: Analysis Report of the Baseline Survey for the TICW Project Phase II in Yunnan Province (Bangkok, International Labour Office, 2005). 35E/CN.4/2006/62, chap. II. \"Demand for commercial para. 24.PART THREE. \u2014ACTION 119Some States have made it an offence to knowingly pay for the services of someone who has been trafficked. In the case of the United Nations-administered Province of Kosovo,a law containing this provision was intended to address demand for women and girls traf-ficked into prostitution. 37Few prosecutions followed, however, apparently because it was difficult to prove that a man paying for sex knew that the prostitute involved had beentrafficked. Instead, the United Nations administration found it more effective to ban indi-viduals employed by the United Nations Interim Mission in Kosovo and foreign militarypersonnel from visiting a range of bars and other places suspected of functioning as brothels.Awareness that men in international peacekeeping forces and peace support operationshave created significant demand for commercial sex and that this has resulted in womenand girls being forced into prostitution prompted the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationto adopt a policy to combat trafficking in human beings in 2004; 38this applies to contractors, as well as personnel taking direct part in operations led by the Organization. There have been other attempts to reduce the demand for trafficked adults and children. As well as suggesting that the purchase of sexual services from children under 18 shouldbe a crime, a UNICEF reference guide suggests strategies to influence the demand forthe services of young people who have been trafficked to beg or work as in private housesas domestics. 39They include influencing members of the public who donate money to trafficked child beggars and influencing minority communities in which school-age chil-dren work full-time instead of attending school. One of the most imaginative measures tocurb demand was reported in the United Arab Emirates, to stop young boys being impor-ted to ride racing camels. Alongside new legislation, in 2005 racing camel owners startedusing small robots or mannequins looking and weighing much the same as the boys whohad previously ridden the camels. 5. Publicity to prevent trafficking On several occasions, agencies concerned that women or children were about to be traf-ficked in large numbers informed the press of their concerns in order to precipitate pre-ventive action. While such tactics achieve publicity in the short term, they risk underminingpublic confidence once they cease to be based on evidence and become speculative. Following the tsunami in the Indian Ocean in December 2004, several organizations pub- licized their concern that conditions were suitable for children to be trafficked. However,few cases were reported. In the run-up to the football World Cup in Germany in 2006, concern was expressed that large numbers of football supporters were likely to constitute a market for commercial sexand thus to encourage trafficking. Some publicity suggested that between 30,000 and 37United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo regulation 2001/4 on the prohibition of trafficking in persons in Kosovo of 12 January 2001, section 4, entitled \"Using or procuring sexual services of person, in a situation of sexual exploitation\" (see http://www.unmikonline.org/regulations/2001/reg04-01.html). 35G.

AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 12060,000 women and girls might be trafficked. These dramatic figures spurred others to reit- erate this concern. The figures were not, however, based on the evidence available toGermany's Federal authorities, which had already initiated preventive steps of their own.Following the World Cup, the German authorities reported that 33 possible cases of traf-ficking had been investigated during the World Cup period and that four women and oneman had been identified who had been trafficked and whose cases were believed to belinked to the World Cup. 40A separate evaluation concluded that the 40,000 estimate was unfounded and unrealistic.41It noted that the number of women believed to be trafficked to Germany each year was usually around a 1,000 persons per year. The evaluationobserved that the publicity (of inaccurate estimates) might hinder the future efforts ofGerman NGOs to gain long-term attention and support for the important work they weredoing. V.\u2014Protection and assistance A.\u2014International standards on protection and assistance Concern that the measures specified in article 6 of the Trafficking Protocol for protecting and assisting trafficked persons were of a general nature prompted several intergovern-mental organizations to issue guidelines clarifying the rights of anyone suspected of hav-ing been trafficked under existing international law, in particular their rights to protectionand assistance. The first set of guidelines has already been mentioned\u2014the UNHCHR Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking (2002). Five of these17 principles address the matter of protection. They specify, for example, that: 42 \"Trafficked persons shall not be detained, charged or prosecuted for the illegality oftheir entry into or residence in countries of transit and destination, or for theirinvolvement in unlawful activities to the extent that such involvement is a direct con-sequence of their situation as trafficked persons.\" In 2003, UNICEF issued its own guidelines on how a person trafficked before reaching 18 should be protected and assisted, Guidelines for Protection of the Rights of ChildVictims of Trafficking. 43These cover 11 issues, including the appointment of a guardian for every trafficked child (who has responsibility for ensuring that all subsequent actions 40Council of the European Union, \"Experience report on human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploita- tion and forced prostitution in connection with the 2006 Football World Cup in Germany\", document 5006/1/07,Rev. 1, Brussels, 19 January 2007. 41J.

In 2006, a set of revised Guidelines (see United Nations Children's Fund, Reference Guide on Protecting the Rights ... , annex I) were issued to be applicable globally (see http://www.unicef.org/ceecis/media_1231.html).PART THREE. \u2014ACTION 121affecting the child make the child's best interests a primary consideration), the procedures for deciding on a durable solution that is in the child's best interests and protection fortrafficked children involved in court cases (whether as victims of crime or witnesses). Inseveral other regions, such as West Africa and South-East Asia, there have been effortsto develop versions that take account of regional-specific needs and patterns of trafficking. In 2006, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees issued its own Guidelines on International Protection: The application of Article 1A(2) of the 1951 Conventionand/or 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees to Victims of Trafficking and Personsat Risk of Being Trafficked. 44These point out that some people believed to have been traf- ficked have a well-founded fear of persecution and \"may therefore be entitled to interna-tional refugee protection\" (para. 12). The Guidelines list forms of abuse and severe exploitation which, the Office maintains, \"will generally amount to persecution\" (para. 15)and consequently entitle the individual concerned to protection as a refugee. B.\u2014Emergency assistance and medical care Adults and children who have been trafficked are frequently in need of medical attention and sometimes suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome. Intergovernmental organiza-tions have issued a range of good practice guidelines concerning assistance and care, inorder to ensure that anyone identified as \"trafficked\" is transferred to a safe place andhas his or her needs assessed. In 2004, IOM issued a set of minimum standards concern-ing mental health care for trafficked persons. 45The IOM minimum standards are inten- ded to help ensure that women and girls trafficked for purposes of sexual exploitationreceive comprehensive and coordinated psychosocial care, and are a guide for any organ-izations assisting such people. The immediate needs of trafficking victims subjected toother forms of exploitation are different: for example, women trafficked into forced labouras domestic workers need compensation (for unpaid work) and new jobs. In 2007, IOMsummarized the lessons learned over the previous 13 years in IOM Handbook on Direct Assistance for Victims of Trafficking. 46 There have also been efforts to develop standards for the residential care of both traf-ficked adults and children. The concern about the poor quality of care for trafficked chil-dren mirrors concerns that other children in institutional care may be subjected to furtherabuse.

In some countries a de facto definition is used to define who shouldbe categorized as a \"trafficked person\", which focuses primarily on women trafficked intocommercial sexual exploitation and does not consider men or boys trafficked into forcedlabour as \"trafficked\". States that have ratified the United Nations Convention against Torture of 1984 are required to ensure that no one is repatriated to a State where they would face torture(either by government officials or non-state actors such as traffickers), by or at the insti-gation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person actingin an official capacity. The high risk of a trafficking victim being tortured makes it virtu-ally obligatory to carry out a risk assessment before returning any trafficked person to hisor her country of origin. Such an assessment must look at possible threats from traffick-ers and their associates to the security of trafficked person and his or her relatives.However, in addition to a security assessment, a risk assessment should take broader, eco-nomic and social factors into account, which might otherwise precipitate an individualback into the control of a trafficker. Re-trafficking can be the result of a returnee beingstigmatized or having no livelihood after returning to his or her place of origin. TheCommittee on the Rights of the Child has outlined the factors to take into account whenconsidering whether a child should return to his or her country of origin, stating that chil-dren may not be returned to a country where there are substantial grounds for believingthat there is a real risk of irreparable harm to the child. The risk assessment must takeinto account the consequences for a child if he or she faces insufficient provision of foodor health services. 48A particular challenge concerns children whose parents are living ille- gally in the country of destination, where it is usually in the child's best interests to bereunited with his or her parents rather than be repatriated. In practice, repatriations have frequently taken place in the absence of any risk assess- ment, leaving people who have been trafficked vulnerable upon their arrival (for example,at an airport) to being re-trafficked. The lack of consensus among States on what the mini-mum acceptable standard is concerning the treatment of trafficking victims before or afterrepatriation seems to have undermined the Trafficking Protocol's efforts to streamline repa-triation procedures. 48The Committee on the Rights of the Child adopted general comment No. 6 (CRC/GC/2005/6) on the treat- ment of unaccompanied and separated children outside their country of origin (see http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/crc/docs/GC6.pdf).PART THREE. \u2014ACTION 123D.\u2014Enabling victims of traffickers to recover and restart their lives When trafficking victims endeavour to get on with their lives, they face a series of hur- dles. These include recovering their self-confidence and self-esteem, finding a suitable wayof earning a living and, in the case of girls and women suspected of having been involvedin prostitution, avoiding the stigma attached to prostitution. Much has been learned in the past decade about what forms of assistance are con- sidered most effective by people who have themselves been trafficked, although it is rarethat they are monitored for long enough to draw conclusions about the long-term impactof different techniques. A significant number of victims who receive vocational trainingare reported to return home to circumstances that do not allow them to obtain a job usingthe training they have received. The lessons reveal that the conventional assumption thatvictims should be repatriated and returned to live with their family is inappropriate andresults too easily in victims being returned to a situation where they suffer further harm(in particular if they originally left to escape an abusive situation). By the time theTrafficking Protocol was adopted, the lesson was already apparent in West Africa thatsending children who had been trafficked abroad (into forced labour or servitude) backto their home villages was tantamount to trying to pour water uphill: in numerous cases,repatriated children who were accompanied back to their home villages departed againwithin a matter of days. 49Much has been learned subsequently about the circumstances in which family reunification is and is not appropriate. In parts of Eastern Europe, semi-independent living arrangements for older adolescents proved successful, albeit expensive.This involved abused adolescents living in accommodation supervised by a social workerwhile they restarted school, engaged in vocational training or started work. VI.\u2014The role of research A.\u2014Research reports on regional patterns and specific countries Research on trafficking in human beings is vital. It allows for the identification of factors that cause trafficking or enable it to happen as well as for the monitoring of the effectsof anti-trafficking measures designed to prevent trafficking as well as to assist traffickedpersons. The importance of research to analyse the causes and consequences of traffick-ing has been repeatedly emphasized, for example by an Organization of American Statesmeeting of specialized anti-trafficking agencies. 50Numerous reports are published every year, and a growing number of websites publicize the findings of those reports. Some 49A. F.

Some present details obtained from repatriated victims in order todraw conclusions about the characteristics of people who are being trafficked, 52especial- ly when it seems that specific groups of people are being trafficked in disproportionate-ly high numbers. While reports published in the late 1990s and in the years following 2000 focused prima- rily on the abuse experienced by trafficked persons (possibly to provoke readers to con-clude that more needed to be done to combat trafficking), in the past few years there hasbeen a move towards reports of a more technical nature, which focus on methods usedto address specific aspects of trafficking and examine their effectiveness. B. Research about those already trafficked, identifying the circumstances in which they were vulnerable to traffickers IOM has been at the forefront of efforts to identify the salient characteristics of victims of trafficking in order to learn what distinguishes them from others who have not beentrafficked. For example, in South-East Europe a disproportionate number of traffickedwomen and girls have experienced domestic abuse or lived in residential care. A casestudy in northern Thailand found that in families with three daughters it was more prob-able that the second-born daughters would be recruited into the sex industry than eithereldest or youngest daughters. 53The report explained the social and cultural reasons for its findings. On the basis of detailed research of this sort, it has been possible to targetprevention efforts on individuals or households with similar characteristics to those alreadytrafficked. Studies of individuals who have been trafficked usually trace what happens to them dur- ing the time they receive professional care, but rarely track their subsequent development.While the right to privacy entitles people to refuse to inform researchers about their sub-sequent experiences, in many cases it is only with the benefit of information about whathappens over several years that it is possible to conclude whether the assistance and pro-tection they received were appropriate or need improving. C.\u2014Research about traffickers and the techniques they use Alongside law enforcement efforts to identify individual criminals, researchers have col- lated the data available about both traffickers and others who collaborate with them. Thisregularly demonstrates that the profile of traffickers presented in public information mate-rials is inaccurate. For example, in parts of South-East Europe where traffickers were rou-tinely presented as disreputable male criminals, evidence collected from trafficked persons 51United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, Trafficking in Persons: Global Patterns (Vienna, United Nations, 2006), a 128-page report summarizing patterns, based on data supplied by States. 52For example, two annual reports on victims of trafficking in South-Eastern Europe issued by the Regional Clearing Point of the International Organization for Migration, the first in 2003 and the second in 2005. 53Taylor, \"Dangerous trade-offs ... \".PART THREE. \u2014ACTION 125showed that had been trafficked by women or by relatives.54The challenge, in this case, was to work out how to warn young people that they had to remainon guard about offers made by relatives (to go abroad \"on holiday\" or to work) withoutfracturing family relationships. 55 In a few cases, research has already examined the roles played by individuals who arecommonly described as \"traffickers\", but who, on close scrutiny, turn out to be involvedin recruitment for jobs in the informal economy that is not of a criminal nature. Indeed,in West Africa one preventive method that has been identified involves supporting andstrengthening certain recruitment practices that already help protect the individuals beingrecruited. D.\u2014Research on the numbers of trafficked persons Having some idea of the numbers of trafficked persons is helpful for Governments that choose what level of resources to allocate to anti-trafficking initiatives. It is problematic,therefore, that estimates unsupported by evidence have been routinely and widely publi-cized. For example, in Europe an elected official reported in 2006 that the United Nationshad estimated that 4 million people were transported within or between countries everyyear in order to be exploited sexually. 56No evidence is available to support estimates approaching this magnitude. A 2006 report issued by the United States of America Government Accountability Office criticizes unfounded numbers cited by Governments, including the United StatesGovernment, noting that the accuracy of the estimates was in doubt because of metho-dological weaknesses, gaps in data and numerical discrepancies. 57The main weakness noted in such estimates is that terms (such as \"victims of trafficking\") are not defined orused precisely. In addition, data on the number of people trafficked are confused withthose on other groups of people, such as the number of migrants smuggled into a country or the number of women in prostitution. One comment in the GovernmentAccountability Office report applies to data published virtually everywhere: \"The incompatibility of definitions for data collection is exacerbated by the intermin- gling of trafficking, smuggling, and illegal migration in official statistics. Countrieshave used different definitions regarding the scope and means of trafficking; theactivities involved ... For example, there are discrepancies in the collection of dataon sex trafficking.\" 54June Kane, Child Trafficking - The People Involved: a Synthesis of Findings from Albania, Moldova, Romania and Ukraine, (Geneva, International Labour Office, 2005); and Mike Dottridge, Action to Prevent Child Trafficking in South Eastern Europe: a Preliminary Assessment (Geneva, UNICEF and Terre des Hommes, 2006). 55Mike Dottridge and Olivier Feneyrol, \"Action to strengthen indigenous child protection mechanisms in West Africa to prevent migrant children from being subjected to abuse\", May 2007 (see http://www.tdh.ch/website/tdhch.nsf/pages/trafficking_documentationE). 56European Parliament, debate on forced prostitution during the 2006 football World Cup, Strasbourg, 12 June 2006 (see http://www.europarl.europa.eu/omk/sipade3?L=EN&OBJID=120219). 57United States of America, Government Accountability Office, Human Trafficking: Better Data, Strategy, and Reporting Needed to Enhance U.S. Anti-trafficking Efforts Abroad, GAO report GAO-06-825 (Washington D.C., July 2006), p. 26 (see http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06825.pdf).AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 126Within the United Nations system, ILO has paid particular attention to the question of numbers of people around the world being subjected to forced labour, including thosewho have been trafficked. In 2005, it estimated that the number of people subjected toforced labour at any given time as a result of trafficking was 2.45 million, of whom 43 percent had been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation (i.e. 1.05 million) and 32 percent for economic exploitation (i.e. 784,000). 58 Global or national estimates may be helpful to calibrate an adequate response to traffick-ing, but they have also glossed over key differences among the people who are traffickedand consequently may result in funds being allocated to inappropriate interventions. InAlbania, for example, general statistics about the numbers of children being traffickedfailed to reveal that they fell into two distinct groups: younger children trafficked for forcedbegging, who mainly belonged to a minority group, and older adolescent girls traffickedfor commercial sexual exploitation. Distinguishing between the two was vital, as quite dif-ferent initiatives were needed to address the two groups. E. Research to monitor, evaluate and assess the impact of prevention and rehabilitation efforts A 2004 evaluation of United States-financed initiatives to prevent human trafficking in Eurasia noted that numerous initiatives had not been evaluated and that some of the eval-uations that had been carried out had measured a project's outputs (e.g. numbers of reportspublished or disseminated), but not their impact on people's lives or their contribution toreducing trafficking. 59A 2007 report by the United States Government Accountability Office focused specifically on shortfalls in monitoring and evaluation, both in UnitedStates-funded bilateral initiatives and in initiatives by intergovernmental organizations. 60It called for improvements in the assessment of the impact of United States-funded projectsand for rigorous evaluation methodologies. It also urged monitoring and evaluation weak-nesses to be addressed at the stage of project design. F.\u2014Research standards: the World Health Organization Some research about individuals subjected to forced labour (whether trafficked or not) by academic researchers and, in particular, by journalists, is reported to have resulted inreprisals by the traffickers. The research thus caused extra harm to the very people whowere willing to talk about being abused. In 2003, the World Health Organization pub-lished a set of Ethical and Safety Recommendations for Interviewing Trafficked Women,containing 10 guiding principles for the ethical and safe conduct of interviews with womenwho had been trafficked. 61Many are also applicable to children and even adult men who 58International Labour Office, A Global Alliance against Forced Labour: Global Report under the Follow-up to the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work (Geneva, International Labour Office, 2005), p. 15. 59Rosenberg and others, op. cit. 60United States of America, Government Accountability Office, Human Trafficking: Monitoring and Evaluation of International Projects are Limited, but Experts Suggest Improvements, GAO report GAO-07-1034 (Washington D.C., July 2007), p. 15 (see http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d071034.pdf). 61Cathy Zimmerman and Charlotte Watts, WHO Ethical and Safety Recommendations for Interviewing Trafficked Women (Geneva, World Health Organization, 2003) (see www.who.int/mip/2003/other_documents/en/Ethical_Safety- GWH.pdf).PART THREE. \u2014ACTION 127have been trafficked. IOM has also published a set of Ethical Principles in Caring for and Interviewing Trafficked Persons, adapted from the WHO recommendations, extended toinclude 18 basic principles and explicitly addressing interviews with children as well asadults. 62Both emphasize the principle that interviewers should take precautions to avoid causing additional harm to individuals who have been trafficked. While the physical and mental well-being of trafficked persons is always of paramount importance, one particular challenge is the ongoing need for accurate, first-hand informa-tion. The often justified reluctance of caregivers to allow access to trafficked persons canhinder the supply of accurate information about victims' experiences and makes it harderto ensure that prevention, interception or protection initiatives meet the needs of thosethey are intended to benefit. In conclusion, it seems crucial to continue with ethical,detailed research to ensure that future anti-trafficking efforts are evidence-based and notbased on inaccurate exaggerations. It is likewise important to distinguish between researchthat brings benefits to people who have been trafficked (for example by making preven-tion efforts more effective) and research designed mainly to provide particular bodies orindividuals with information that they use to publicize their activities and obtain funds. VII.\u2014Conclusion At the same time as summarizing major responses to trafficking in persons initiated over the past decade, this paper also points to numerous ways in which these anti-traffickingpolicies and initiatives could be made more effective. In particular, it emphasizes the vitalrole of collecting evidence about the numbers of people being trafficked and the formsof exploitation to which they are being subjected, so that prevention initiatives and virtu-ally all other anti-trafficking efforts are tailored to meet the task before them. The corol-lary is that anti-trafficking initiatives should not be inspired by well-publicized butunsubstantiated estimates that have sometimes vastly exaggerated the number of peoplebeing trafficked or seriously underestimated them. In relation to protection and assistance for trafficked persons, section V.A mentions numer- ous international standards that have been established to guide States and their agencies.No single body or mechanism within the United Nations system is responsible for ensur-ing that these standards are adhered to or for giving advice to States where the level ofprotection and assistance is significantly lower than called for in the standards. Not sur-prisingly, the result is that many trafficked persons prefer not to make contact with gov-ernment agencies to protect or assist them, which has unfortunate consequences for thetrafficked person, who is not able to get assistance, and for the States, which are hinderedin their efforts to bring criminals to justice. It seems to be a clear priority to raise thesestandards and to develop mechanisms for mutual accountability between States on thequality of the protection and assistance they provide. With so many different (and sometimes contradictory) recommendations made to Governments by international and regional governmental organizations and specialized 62International Organization for Migration, IOM Handbook on Direct ... .AN INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING: VULNERABILITY, IMPACT AND ACTION 128agencies, it is perhaps not surprising that responses to trafficking have been so diverse. The attention given in recent years to identifying \"good practice\" is encouraging, but theprocedures for allowing different institutions and States to discuss and reach agreementabout what constitutes \"good practice\" are still not in place. Overcoming this challengeand making it a priority to agree on what constitutes \"good practice\" in the future shouldensure that anti-trafficking initiatives become more effective and that money allocated tostopping trafficking in persons is used more effectively.Vienna International Centre, PO Box 500, 1400 Vienna, Austria Tel: Introduction to Human Trafficking: Vulnerability, Impact "}
