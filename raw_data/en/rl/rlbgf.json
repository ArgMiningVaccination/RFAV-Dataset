To begin, \"Multicultural health is the phrase used to reflect the need to provide health care services in a sensitive, knowledgeable, and nonjudgmental manner with respect for people's health beliefs and practices when they are different from our own\" (Ritter & Graham, 2017, p.3). Identically, \"worldview is a set of cultural assumptions and beliefs that express how people see, interpret, and explain their experience\" (Tilbert, 2010). In essence, worldview as it applies to multicultural health means understanding cultural differences with an emphasis on how individuals of a specific group view themselves, their beliefs and assumptions that influence healthcare delivery, the kinds of relationships they hold, and the type of communities they create. It is imperative that healthcare professionals become culturally competent to the patients/communities served in order to build trust, establish relationships, and work skillfully and successfully in a culturally diverse environment. People of different cultures views of healthcare varies significantly. For example, when health outreach workers in India sought to provide children with free Polio vaccinations, many parents declined the immunization because they believed \"Allah\" would improve their children's health. Another example; Filipino patients may choose not to discuss end-of-life care because such conversations demonstrate a lack of respect for the belief that individual fate is determined by God. By the same token, in an article written by Javier Boyas, Nalini Negi, and Pamela Valera (Factors Associated to Health Care Service Use Among Latino Day Laborers, 2017), a study was conducted on Latino Day Laborers (LDLs) who were at elevated risks or disease and injury because of the environments in which they work. The behavior model of health service use was utilized to gather predisposing factors (biological factors & social characteristics), enabling factors (community and personal resources that facilitated use), and perceived need factors (an individual's perception of their own general 2 Multicultural Health: Worldview and Cultural Comparisons health/whether or not they perceived their health issues to be critical enough to seek medical care) to predict the use of health services amongst them. Studies depicted that older LDLs who achieved higher levels of education, were legal citizens/residents of the U.S., and married were more likely to use health services. Also, those who gained higher levels of trust in medical personnel and doctors were more likely to utilize health services. That said, language awareness, building trust, and socioeconomic status influenced health decisions.
