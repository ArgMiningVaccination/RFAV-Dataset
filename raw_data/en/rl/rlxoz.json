Showing 1151 cr\u00f4nicas impacto gravidade da dor (41% vs. ida When the first basal insulin analog was approved for treatment of type II diabetes in 2000, prescribing of neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) fell sharply in comparison. Basal insulin analogs are often touted for their once daily dosing and reduced risk of asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia. NPH does have a slightly shorter half-life, but can be dosed once or twice daily and is \u00bd to 1/10 of the cost. A recently published large retrospective cohort analysis evaluated clinically meaningful hypoglycemia in patients treated with NPH compared to basal insulin analogs ( [JAMA 2018](http://go.ebsco.com/Y0T0m0VsP00LD002HNL0nQx)). The trial measured time to a hypoglycemia-related ED visit or hospital admission in 25,489 patients with type II diabetes who initiated insulin therapy with either NPH or basal analog over a mean 1.7 years. The notably smaller cohort receiving basal analog insulin (1,928 compared to 23,561 in NPH cohort) were more likely to have a greater number of comorbid conditions and more ED or hospital visits in the prior year. In order to minimize the effect of these covariates, the authors performed a propensity score matched analysis that took into account the relevant baseline characteristics. There was no significant difference in hypoglycemia-related ED visits or hospital admissions comparing patients initiated on basal insulin analog or NPH in the primary analysis or after propensity score matching. There was a statistically significant reduction in HbA1C in those patients treated with NPH (1.48 percentage points) compared to basal insulin analogs (1.26 percentage points), though this difference is unlikely to be clinically meaningful. Focus Point: When choosing between NPH and basal insulin analogs for your type II diabetic patients, perhaps the only meaningful difference between the two is cost.

Up to 6% of children 3 years old have had an allergic reaction to food, with prevalence being even higher in children with atopic disease such as eczema or asthma. Standard advice to parents has been to delay the introduction of common allergenic foods such as eggs and peanuts in an attempt to prevent food hypersensitivity. Presently, the World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life ( [World Health Organization Statement 2011](http://go.ebsco.com/O0Z0n08Q0200sLH00r0TwZN)). Some studies suggest a reduced risk of peanut allergy with early exposure ( [J Allergy Clin Immunol 2008 Nov;122(5):984](http://go.ebsco.com/TssLZ0n0w000ZN120H08TQ0), [N 2015 Feb 26;372(9):803](http://go.ebsco.com/a0200H0w8L0Z00tQ2NsZ0nT)) and prompt the question: does introduction of allergenic foods earlier than 6 months of age decrease the development of food allergies when compared with exclusive breastfeeding in healthy infants? The EAT trial randomized 1,303 exclusively breast-fed healthy term infants to introduction of allergenic foods at age 3 months or 6 months and followed them until age 3 years. Infants in the intervention group had introduction of 6 allergenic foods at 3 months of age (2 g twice weekly each): cow's milk first, followed by peanut, egg, sesame, and fish in random order, and wheat last. Infants in the control group were exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life and then began consumption of allergenic foods at the parents' discretion. All infants continued breastfeeding until at least 5 months. Skin prick testing for the 6 intervention foods was performed on all infants at the 1-year and 3-year visits and in the infants in the intervention group at 3 months of age. The control infants did not undergo testing at 3 months so as to not influence introduction of allergenic foods. Food allergy was diagnosed by blinded food challenges (95%) or wheal 5 mm on skin-prick test (5%). All participating families completed online questionnaires monthly until infants were age 1 year, and then every 3 months until age 3 years. Of the enrolled infants, 89.2% completed the study and were included in an intention-to-treat analysis. Adherence (defined as consumption of 3 g/week of allergenic protein of 5 foods for 5 weeks) was 31.9% in the 3-month introduction group compared to 80.5% in the 6-month introduction group (no p value reported). The median age of introduction of allergenic foods in the early intervention group was 4-5 months. Comparing early introduction of allergenic foods vs 6 months in the intention-to-treat analysis of trial completers, there was no significant difference between the two groups in food challenge-proven allergy to one or more of the allergenic foods (5.6% vs 7.1%). Analysis of secondary outcomes (allergies to specific foods and positive skin prick testing for individual foods) also showed no significant difference between groups in any of the food allergies. This randomized trial demonstrated no benefit of early introduction of allergenic foods compared to standard introduction at age 6 months based on intention-to-treat analysis. While early introduction of specific allergenic foods demonstrated some benefit in per-protocol analysis, consideration of potential reasons for the high rate of protocol non-adherence is critical, including the possibility that the first sign of clinical food allergy is aversive feeding behavior. Further, early introduction of allergenic foods in the real world would likely lack the strict adherence to food introduction order and amount, leading to even more uncertainty regarding the clinical applicability of these data.

However, the ACS recently released a new qualified recommendation to initiate CRC screening at age 45 for average-risk adults. The authors cited the growing incidence of CRC in younger adults dating back to 1994. This qualified recommendation is based on two analyses of disease burden and modeling which predicted an increased number of life-years gained if screening were initiated at age 45 rather than age 50. Not surprisingly, these analyses also predicted more lifetime colonoscopies with earlier initiation of screening. Higher quality trial data demonstrating benefit or harm of initiating CRC screening at age 45 is lacking. It is worth noting, however, that expert opinion heavily influenced the somewhat arbitrary use of age 50 as the point of screening initiation in the published randomized controlled trials examining the effects of CRC screening, the data upon which the strong recommendations by many organizations are based. The 2018 ACS guideline suggests that lowering the age of screening initiation could reduce the health disparities in populations with higher disease burden, including African Americans, Alaskan Natives, and some American Indians. Additionally, many adults delay the first CRC screening by 5 years or more, suggesting that an earlier discussion may result in higher screening rates by age 50. Certainly this line of reasoning for making a recommendation is not yet supported by a rich evidence base, but could turn out to be a valid point as more data accumulate. It is also worth keeping in mind that screening always entails risks. These include overdiagnosis (identifying cancers that never would have been symptomatic during the patient's lifetime) and complications from invasive procedures, which in the case of colonoscopy includes a risk of serious complications of about 2.8/1,000. Focus Point: Getting your average-risk patients to undergo CRC screening at age 50 will reduce disease burden and CRC-related mortality. In light of these new analyses, consider engaging in some shared decision-making about whether to begin screening a few years earlier in an effort to further reduce that risk.

Methods for induction often are based upon the Bishop score. A low Bishop score (<5) is an indicator of likely extended latent phase of labor and higher rates of cesarean delivery ( [Obstet Gynecol 2005 Apr;105(4):690-7](http://go.ebsco.com/Bv00LL2Qs00000gN0Z9Hi8T)). To hemorrhage (PPH), chorioamnionitis, and endometritis related to extended latent phase, methods should be considered to shorten labor length ( [Obstet Gynecol 2005 Apr;105(4):705-9](http://go.ebsco.com/CNi00M0aH0gL0sTZ280vQ00)). Both the Foley catheter and oxytocin infusions are well established mechanisms to induce labor. Observational studies exploring their concurrent use have had mixed outcomes, but the concurrent use of Foley catheter and oxytocin infusion to increase delivery rate within 24 hours has not been investigated. A randomized controlled trial of 323 women (mean age 27 years) with singleton pregnancy at 24 weeks gestation evaluated the safety and delivery outcomes of concurrent use of Foley catheter and oxytocin infusion for induction of labor. The women were randomized to either concurrent use of Foley and oxytocin infusion (defined by oxytocin infusion initiation within one hour of Foley placement) or sequential use (defined by oxytocin infusion after the Foley was expelled spontaneously or had remained in place for at least 12 hours). The randomization was generated separately for nulliparous and multiparous women to allow for power to detect differences between these groups. The primary outcome was delivery within 24 hours after Foley placement. Several pre-specified secondary outcomes were delineated including total time from induction to delivery and mode of delivery as well as maternal and fetal outcomes (complications such as tachysystole, chorioamnionitis, and postpartum hemorrhage [PPH]). Baseline characteristics were similar among groups. The rate of vaginal delivery within 24 hours in nulliparous women was 64% in the concurrent use group vs. 43% in the sequential use group (risk ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.12-2; NNT 5). In the multiparous group, 87% of those with concurrent use delivered within 24 hours compared to 72% of those with sequential use (risk ratio 1.22, 95% CI 1.02-1.45; NNT 7). Median time to delivery in the nulliparous group was 20.9 hours with concurrent use vs. 26.1 hours with sequential use (p < 0.001). In the multiparous group, median time to delivery was 14. 9 hours in the concurrent group vs. 18.6 hours in the sequential group (p = 0.013). In both groups, concurrent use was also associated with increased use of regional anesthesia (p < 0.01 for each) and longer duration of oxytocin infusion (p < 0.01 for each). There were no significant differences in maternal or neonatal outcomes (such as tachysystole, chorioamnionitis, PPH, and neonatal intensive care unit admission) in either the nulliparous or multiparous groups. Induction of labor, regardless of the indication, requires consideration of available methods to ensure maternal and fetal safety and prevent adverse outcomes. This study demonstrated a significantly increased likelihood of delivery within 24 hours of catheter placement as well as a significant reduction in labor time with concurrent use of a Foley catheter and oxytocin. The validity of these results, however, is limited by methodological concerns. These include lack of blinding of both patients and the physicians administering treatment, and a lack of statistical power for subgroups (such as premature prelabor rupture of membranes or vaginal birth after cesarean delivery). Further research is needed to evaluate the effect of concurrent use on adverse fetal outcomes and additional clinically relevant maternal outcomes.

To evaluate the long-term risks of developing diseases that may be impacted by changes in immune function, a retrospective cohort study of 1,753,100 children was conducted using Danish electronic medical records. Individuals born from 1979 to 1999 were assessed for adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, or adenotonsillectomy before age 9 and subsequent (up to age 30) development of each of 28 target disease groups. Target disease groups were defined by ICD codes and included infectious, allergic, and respiratory diseases, as well as circulatory, endocrine, and other diseases that may be indirectly affected by immune dysfunction. Children were excluded if they were part of multiple gestations; had any of the 3 surgeries after age 9; had outlying weight, length, or parental age at birth; or had missing data for numerous covariates used in analyses. Also, for each target disease group, the analysis was restricted to children who were not diagnosed with a qualifying disease before age 9. A total of 1,218,351 children were included in the risk analyses. The risk with each of the 3 surgeries was assessed separately, and the p value determining statistical significance was adjusted for multiple comparisons (78 in total; 6 of a possible 84 assessments were not conducted due to insufficient power). In the cohort, 1.4% of children had adenoidectomy, 1% had tonsillectomy, and 2.6% had adenotonsillectomy before age 9. Each of the 3 surgeries was associated with modest but significant increased risks of almost all target disease groups. The largest risks were observed for upper respiratory tract conditions, which occurred after age 9 in 10.77% of patients without surgery and had a relative risk (RR) with tonsillectomy of 2.72 (95% CI 1.54-4.8) and an RR with adenoidectomy of 1.99 (95% CI 1.51-2.63) (there was insufficient power to assess the risk with adenotonsillectomy). For several other disease groups, at least 1 surgery had a large increased risk (arbitrarily defined here as an RR with an upper limit of the 95% CI > 1.9). The single group of \"any respiratory condition\" had an RR of 1.48 (95% CI 1.13-1.95) with adenoidectomy and occurred in 20.19% without surgery, but there was insufficient power to assess risks with tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. There were also large increased risks of allergic conjunctivitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but each condition occurred in < 0.3% without surgery. Each of the surgeries were associated with smaller increased risks (upper limit of 95% CI < 1.9) for infectious/parasitic conditions, but the effect may be meaningful due to the high event rate of this disease group (12.1% without surgery). Similarly, several other disease groups were at a small increased risk with each of the surgeries but have at least a moderate event rate (5%-10%): lower respiratory tract conditions, any skin condition, any digestive condition, asthma, any eye/adnexa condition, and pneumonia. Finally, the 3 surgeries were not associated with long-term reduced risks of most conditions they aim to treat (other than tonsillitis): adenoidectomy was associated with a reduced risk of sleep disorders, but it was also associated with an increased risk of chronic sinusitis. Adenotonsillectomy was associated with an increased risk of sinusitis, and all 3 surgeries were associated with an increased risk of otitis media. None were associated with altered risks of abnormal breathing. This study suggests that childhood removal of the tonsils and/or adenoids is associated with long-term modest increased risks of diseases that may be affected by changes in immune function, particularly respiratory, allergic, and infectious diseases. The retrospective and observational nature of this study limit conclusions to a description of an association; although numerous covariates were used in the risk analyses, confounding in a cohort study cannot be reduced to the levels of a randomized trial. For example, children who are prone to respiratory infections and other diseases or who are more likely to use the healthcare system may be more likely to have their tonsils and/or adenoids removed. The exclusion of children who were diagnosed with a qualifying disease before age 9 in the risk analysis for a target disease group mitigates this concern slightly, but the use of ICD codes alone to determine event rates does not capture many conditions that may affect overall health. Finally, potential confounding related to differential access to healthcare is reduced by using Danish health registries, but this also limits generalization to countries without universal healthcare systems. Nevertheless, previous evidence evaluating possible long-term risks of tonsil or adenoid removal is limited. The associations in this study, while being interpreted within the context of study limitations, should be considered when deciding between conservative and surgical management for children with recurrent sore throats or other indications for tonsil or adenoid removal.

The recommendations were recently updated in light of the increasing use of active surveillance rather than immediate treatment for low-risk prostate cancer, which may decrease treatment-related harms, and the availability of longer follow-up data suggesting that the benefit of screening to prevent death from prostate cancer increases over time. The supporting evidence for the updated 2018 USPSTF Recommendation Statement was published in a recent systematic review of 63 studies evaluating PSA prostate cancer screening, treatment for localized prostate cancer, and prebiopsy risk calculators in 1,904,950 men. Meta-analyses for outcomes evaluating benefits and harms of PSA screening were not performed due to heterogeneity in the populations and interventions in the included studies. Three randomized trials in the review compared PSA screening vs. no screening in 647,906 asymptomatic men. The median follow-up time ranged from 10 to 14.8 years. The screening intervals in the intervention arm ranged from a single invitation to every 1-4 years, and the PSA thresholds prompting biopsy varied across trials. The age of the men evaluated was 50-69 years, 55-69 years, and 55-74 years in one trial each. There was no significant difference between groups in all-cause mortality in any of the three trials. Inconsistent results were observed for prostate cancer mortality. PSA screening at 2-4 year intervals was associated with reduced prostate cancer mortality in 1 trial with 162,243 men (0.48% vs. 0.6% with no screening, relative risk [RR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.91). The number needed to invite (NNI) for PSA screening ranged from 490 to 1,929 over a median follow-up of 13 years. No significant difference in this risk was found in the other 2 trials. Screening every 2 to 4 years was associated with decreased risk of metastatic cancer in a subgroup analysis of 4 centers in 1 trial at a median follow-up of 12 years in 146,322 men (RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.6-0.82, NNI 227-556). False-positive results among screened men ranged from 10.4% to 17.8% in 2 trials, estimates of overdiagnosis of cancer detected by screening ranged from 16.4% to 50.4% in all 3 trials, and overall complication rate ranged from 2% to 5.6% of men undergoing biopsy in 2 studies. The findings outlined in the systematic review suggest that PSA screening may not reduce all-cause mortality. The evidence for prostate cancer mortality is inconsistent and may reflect the differences in adherence to protocol among the 3 trials. There was high adherence to screening in the 1 trial finding a difference. In the other 2 trials, 1 trial had high crossover from the no-screening arm to the screening arm, and the other had low adherence to the single invitation for a PSA screen. It should be noted that the evidence evaluating screening in men > 70 years old is very limited and the potential harms and benefits should be weighed in light of existing comorbidities. The evidence is also limited among men who are African American or who have a family history of prostate cancer. This is of importance as these groups may be at increased risk of prostate cancer death compared to the general population ( [SEER Cancer Stat Facts: Prostate Cancer. National Cancer Institute](http://go.ebsco.com/R00H0DtNLT0020P0LrQu3s0)). Further research is needed to evaluate whether these high risk groups would benefit from earlier screening, and whether there is clinical benefit to be derived from the use of prebiopsy risk calculators or other tests in combination with PSA screening. In summary, the decision to undergo PSA screening should balance the potential reduction in prostate cancer mortality with potential harms such as false-positive results, overdiagnosis, and biopsy-related complications in view of the patient's personal risk profile, comorbidities, and preferences. Decision aids to facilitate these types of discussions with patients are available.

Adjuvant chemotherapy should be considered if there is a high risk of recurrence ( [Lancet 2017](http://go.ebsco.com/Bs00zL2Qs00000DN0DPHPLT)) and has been considered for many women with early-stage cancer. However, its value is unclear if the risk of recurrence is moderate. In the TAILORx trial, 6,907 moderate-risk women who had primary surgical therapy for HR-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer were randomized to endocrine therapy alone vs. chemoendocrine therapy (adjuvant chemotherapy plus endocrine therapy). A moderate risk of recurrence was defined as an Oncotype DX 21-gene recurrence score of 11 to 25 (score range 0-100, with higher scores indicating greater risk). The primary outcome was invasive disease-free (IDF) survival, defined as freedom from death, invasive disease recurrence, and second primary cancer. Fewer patients in the endocrine therapy alone group did not adhere to allocated therapy (5.4% had chemotherapy, while 18.4% in the chemoendocrine therapy group did not have chemotherapy) or were excluded from analyses after randomization (in 1.7% vs. 4%). The two treatment groups had similar rates of IDF survival at median 90 months: 83.3% with endocrine therapy alone vs. 84.3% with chemoendocrine therapy (hazard ratio [HR] for not achieving IDF survival 1.08, 95% CI 0.94-1.24). They also had similar rates of overall survival at median 96 months (93.9% vs. 93.8%, HR for death 0.99, 95% CI 0.79-1.22) and freedom from recurrence (92.2% vs. 92.9%, HR for recurrence 1.11, 95% CI 0.9-1.37). In as-treated analyses, no significant differences in rates of IDF survival or its components were found, but there was a non-significant increased risk of not achieving IDF survival with endocrine therapy alone (HR 1.14, 95% CI 0.99-1.31). The TAILORx trial found that chemotherapy in addition to endocrine therapy may not be beneficial in women who had primary surgical therapy for HR-positive, HER2-negative, axillary node-negative breast cancer with a moderate risk of recurrence as defined by an Oncotype DX score of 11 to 25. Although adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly change the rates of important outcomes in the intention-to-treat or as-treated analyses, the 95% CI's could not exclude clinically important differences. This concern is exacerbated by the greater proportion of patients allocated to chemoendocrine therapy who did not adhere to the treatment or were excluded from analyses. On the other hand, chemotherapy is accompanied by serious adverse events and reduced quality of life, and patients may choose to avoid it unless there is a clearly demonstrated benefit. The TAILORx trial did not find a benefit with adjuvant chemotherapy for women with the type of breast cancer included in this trial, indicating that endocrine therapy alone may be considered as an option in this patient population.

[Read breastfeeding, except for vitamins, minerals, and medications, for the first six months of life is recommended by several health organizations ( [Pediatrics 2012](http://go.ebsco.com/tTQn280VLZ0HT00sN0000rB), [American Academy of Family Physicians 2015](http://go.ebsco.com/p0000L0rUQ080CsNTH0nZV2), [Obstet Gynecol 2016](http://go.ebsco.com/R00H0ZrN8T0020n0LDQVVs0)). Before abundant maternal milk production is established, some exclusively breastfed newborns may have an increased risk of hyperbilirubinemia and during early life, however, is discouraged due to concerns that it may alter intestinal microbiota and negatively impact continued breastfeeding. In a recent trial, 164 healthy, singleton infants born 37 weeks gestation (age range 24-72 hours) who were exclusively breastfed and had pronounced weight loss ( 75th percentile for age) were randomized to limited formula supplementation vs. continuation with exclusive breastfeeding. Supplementation consisted of giving the newborn 10 mL formula via feeding syringe after each breastfeeding, and was stopped after abundant maternal milk production was established. Breastfeeding status was assessed via telephone interview conducted by an outcome assessor blinded to treatment allocation. Newborns in the supplementation group received formula on an average of 5.4 times per day for a median of 2 days, and 37% of newborns in the control group had been given some formula by one week of age. There were no significant differences in the rates of breastfeeding at 1 month (86.5% with supplementation vs. 89.7% with exclusive breastfeeding, risk ratio for cessation 1.21, 95% CI 0.55-3.16) or rates of breastfeeding without formula use in the previous 24 hours (54.6% vs. 65.8%). None of the newborns in the supplementation group were readmitted to the hospital, while 5 newborns (4.8%) in the control group were (p = 0.06). The reasons for readmission in the control group were hyperbilirubinemia in 3, umbilical infection in 1, and unknown in 1. The findings of this trial suggest that early limited formula supplementation of breastfeeding does not significantly reduce rates of continued breastfeeding at 1 month. The confidence in this finding is tempered by the wide 95% confidence interval in risk of breastfeeding cessation, which includes the possibilities of both beneficial and adverse clinically significant differences. It should be noted that supplementation was given via a feeding syringe rather than a bottle, and this may have helped to avoid nipple confusion, which may interfere with breastfeeding in some infants. A possible benefit of early supplementation in these neonates was suggested by the reduced rate of hospital readmissions, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Preliminary analyses of intestinal microbiota conducted on 15 convenience stool samples taken during the trial were promising in that they suggest that the limited use of formula may not reduce the abundance of Lactobacillus or increase the abundance of Clostridia. These findings, however, require further investigation. Finally, the generalizability of the findings is limited by the low representation of women under 25 years of age (< 15%), a population at increased risk of early discontinuation ( [J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr 2015](http://go.ebsco.com/o02Gs00YV00rnL00ZQNT8H0)). In summary, this trial suggests that temporary and limited syringe-administered formula supplementation until an abundant maternal milk supply is established may be considered for selected neonates and their mothers.

[Read EBM SYGMA 2 evidence](http://go.ebsco.com/o02es00iZ00qPL00DQNTLH0)) Regularly administered low-dose inhaled corticosteroids are recommended as maintenance therapy for mild persistent asthma ( [GINA 2018](http://go.ebsco.com/DLf000j0QND00Z0qHs2P0TL), [Lancet 2018](http://go.ebsco.com/hHPqg0N00L000LTZs020QkD)). However, patient low ( [Curr Opin Pulm Med combined corticosteroid/beta agonist inhaler may be attractive to many patients. In the SYGMA 2 noninferiority trial, 4,215 patients with mild persistent asthma were randomized to as-needed as-needed budesonide/formoterol regimen also included twice-daily placebo doses, and the maintenance budesonide regimen also included an as-needed terbutaline 0.5 mg inhaler. The criterion for noninferiority was < 1.2 for the upper limit of the 1-sided 95% CI for the rate ratio for severe exacerbations with as-needed budesonide/formoterol compared to maintenance budesonide. Exacerbations were considered severe if they required systemic corticosteroids for 3 days, an emergency department visit leading to systemic corticosteroids, or hospitalization. Overall symptom severity was assessed with the Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 score (total score range 0-6), with symptom improvement defined as a 0.5 point decrease from baseline. Ninety-one percent of patients completed treatment, and 99% were included in the analyses. Noninferiority for as-needed budesonide/formoterol was met: the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations was 0.11 with as-needed budesonide/formoterol vs. 0.12 with maintenance budesonide (rate ratio 0.97, upper limit of 1-sided 95% CI 1.16). The two groups had similar risks of experiencing at least 1 severe exacerbation during the year (in 8.5% vs. 8.8%), proportion of patient-days without using as-needed inhalers (69% vs. 76%), and adherence to maintenance doses (64% vs. 63%). Daily inhaled corticosteroid use was numerically less with as-needed budesonide/formoterol (median 66 vs. 268 mcg), but a statistical comparison was not reported. However, as-needed budesonide/formoterol was associated with a slightly lower likelihood of symptom improvement (in 40.3% vs. 44.3%, p < 0.05). Rates of adverse events were similar between the two groups (in 42.5% vs. 44% of patients), most commonly viral upper respiratory tract infection (7.4% vs. 8%) (statistical comparisons were not reported). The results from the SYGMA 2 trial demonstrated that, in adolescents and adults with mild persistent asthma, an as-needed budesonide/formoterol inhaler may be an alternative to daily maintenance corticosteroids. There is some uncertainty regarding the noninferiority of as-needed budesonide/formoterol because a per-protocol analysis was not conducted to confirm the results. In secondary analyses, the as-needed regimen also may have reduced inhaled corticosteroid exposure, but it was slightly inferior regarding symptom improvement. Whether or not these differences are clinically relevant may depend on the individual patient. Also, the long-term effects of these differences, particularly with regard to a potential role of corticosteroids in preventing airway remodeling, remain to be seen. On the other hand, an as-needed regimen may be more attractive than a maintenance regimen for many patients. The companion [SYGMA 1](http://go.ebsco.com/uis000DN0H0T0m02ZPLLQq0) trial reported consistent results, and also that as-needed budesonide/formoterol was superior to as-needed terbultaline monotherapy. Finally, it should be noted that the specific formulations used in the SYGMA 2 trial may not be available in every country. While equivalence of similar as-needed budesonide/formoterol formulations is likely, it cannot be guaranteed.
