Typically, people have diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis is based on a person's history of recent contact with contaminated food, water, or people infected with certain microorganisms; recent use of antibiotics; and sometimes laboratory tests. Antibiotics are given to treat gastroenteritis that is caused only by parasites or certain bacteria. Thoroughly washing the hands after a bowel movement or contact with fecal matter and avoidance of undercooked foods are the best ways to prevent infection. Gastroenteritis usually consists of mild to severe diarrhea that may be accompanied by loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, cramps, and discomfort in the abdomen. Although gastroenteritis usually is not serious in a healthy adult, causing only discomfort and inconvenience, it can cause life-threatening [dehydration](/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/water-balance/dehydration) [ Dehydration Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body.

Causes of Gastroenteritis The most common causes of gastroenteritis are Viruses (most common) Bacteria Parasites Other causes include Infections that cause gastroenteritis can be transmitted from person to person, especially if people with diarrhea do not thoroughly wash their hands after a bowel movement. Infection also can occur if people touch their mouth after touching an object (such as a diaper or toy) contaminated by infected stool. All such transmission involving infected stool is termed fecal-oral transmission. A person, and sometimes large numbers of people (in which case an outbreak of illness is called an epidemic), can also become infected by eating food or drinking water that has been contaminated by infected stool. Most foods can be contaminated with bacteria and cause gastroenteritis if not cooked thoroughly or pasteurized. Contaminated water is sometimes ingested in unexpected ways, such as when swimming in a pond contaminated by stool from an animal or in a swimming pool contaminated by stool from another person. In some cases, gastroenteritis is acquired through direct contact with animals that carry the infectious microorganism. Viruses [Viruses](/home/infections/overview-of-viral-infections/overview-of-viral-infections) [ Overview of Viral Infections A virus is composed of nucleic acid, either DNA or RNA, surrounded by a protein coat.

Certain viruses infect cells in the lining of the small intestine where they multiply and cause watery diarrhea, vomiting, and fever. Four types of viruses cause gastroenteritis: norovirus, rotavirus, astrovirus, and enteric (intestinal) adenovirus. Most viral gastroenteritis infections are caused by Astrovirus can infect people of all ages but usually infects infants and young children. In temperate climates, infection is most common during winter months. In tropical climates, infection is more common during summer months. It is spread by fecal-oral transmission. Symptoms start 3 to 4 days after infection. Adenovirus is the 4th most common cause of childhood viral gastroenteritis. It most commonly affects children under the age of 2. Infections occur year-round and increase slightly in the summer. The infection is spread by fecal-oral transmission and in respiratory droplets of moisture such as those produced by coughing. Anyone nearby may inhale these droplets and become infected. Symptoms start 3 to 10 days after infection. Other viruses (such as [cytomegalovirus](/home/infections/herpesvirus-infections/cytomegalovirus-cmv-infection) [ Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Infection Cytomegalovirus infection is a common herpesvirus infection with a wide range of symptoms: from no symptoms to fever and fatigue (resembling infectious mononucleosis) to severe symptoms involving... read more ](/home/infections/herpesvirus-infections/cytomegalovirus-cmv-infection) and [enterovirus](/home/infections/enteroviruses/overview-of-enterovirus-infections) [ Overview of Enterovirus Infections Enteroviruses are a group of viruses.

There, they damage cells, causing sores (ulcerations) that bleed, and allow a considerable leakage of fluid containing proteins, electrolytes, and water. The diarrhea contains microscopic white and red blood cells and sometimes visible blood. Salmonella and Campylobacter are common bacterial causes of diarrhea in the United States. Both infections are most frequently acquired from eating undercooked poultry. Unpasteurized milk is also a possible source. Campylobacter is occasionally transmitted by dogs or cats with diarrhea. Salmonella can be transmitted by eating undercooked eggs and by having contact with reptiles (such as turtles or lizards), birds, or amphibians (such as frogs and salamanders). Species of Shigella are also a common bacterial cause of diarrhea in the United States and are usually transmitted person to person (especially in day care centers), although foodborne outbreaks occur. [E. coli gastroenteritis](/home/digestive-disorders/gastroenteritis/e-coli-gastroenteritis) [ E. coli Gastroenteritis E. coli gastroenteritis is a type of gastroenteritis in which certain strains of the bacterium Escherichia coli infect the large intestine and cause diarrhea and sometimes other... read more ](/home/digestive-disorders/gastroenteritis/e-coli-gastroenteritis) can be caused by several different subtypes of the bacteria.

Aeromonas is acquired from swimming in or drinking contaminated fresh water or briny, salty water. Plesiomonas shigelloides can cause diarrhea in people who have eaten raw shellfish or traveled to tropical regions in low-resource countries. Parasites The most common parasites are Certain intestinal parasites, particularly Giardia intestinalis, stick to the lining of the intestine and cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a general sick feeling.

Infection is usually spread through drinking contaminated water (sometimes from wells or unconventional water sources encountered while hiking or camping), eating contaminated food, or through person-to-person contact (such as in day care centers). Another intestinal parasite, called Cryptosporidium parvum, causes watery diarrhea that is sometimes accompanied by abdominal cramps, nausea, and vomiting. The resulting infection, called [cryptosporidiosis](/home/infections/parasitic-infections-intestinal-protozoa-and-microsporidia/cryptosporidiosis) [ Cryptosporidiosis Cryptosporidiosis is an intestinal infection caused by Cryptosporidium, a protozoan parasite.

Amebiasis is a common cause of bloody diarrhea in countries where sanitation is inadequate but is rare in the United States. Symptoms of Gastroenteritis The type and severity of the symptoms depend on the type and quantity of microorganism or toxin ingested. Symptoms also vary according to the person's resistance. Symptoms often begin suddenly\u2014sometimes dramatically\u2014with a loss of appetite, nausea, or vomiting. Audible rumbling of the intestine and abdominal cramping may occur. Diarrhea is the most common symptom and may be accompanied by visible blood and mucus. The abdomen (and the loops of intestine inside) may be painfully swollen (distended) with gas. The person may have a fever, feel generally sick, and have aching muscles and extreme exhaustion. Gastroenteritis caused by viruses Viruses cause watery diarrhea. Stools rarely contain mucus or blood. For symptoms specific to norovirus and rotavirus, see [Norovirus Gastroenteritis](/home/digestive-disorders/gastroenteritis/norovirus-gastroenteritis) [ Norovirus Gastroenteritis Gastroenteritis is inflammation of the lining of the stomach and small and large intestines.

Adenovirus causes mild vomiting 1 to 2 days after diarrhea starts. The diarrhea can last 1 to 2 weeks. Infants and children may have mild vomiting that typically starts 1 to 2 days after diarrhea starts. A low fever occurs in about 50% of people. Some people may have nasal congestion, a runny nose, scratchy throat, and cough. Symptoms are typically mild but can last longer than with other viral causes of gastroenteritis. Astrovirus symptoms are similar to a mild rotavirus infection. Gastroenteritis caused by bacteria Bacteria are likely to cause fever and may cause bloody or watery diarrhea. Some bacteria also cause vomiting. Gastroenteritis caused by parasites Parasites typically cause diarrhea that may last for a long time and may cause diarrhea that comes and goes. The diarrhea is usually not bloody. People may be very tired and lose weight when they have long-lasting diarrhea caused by a parasitic infection. Complications of gastroenteritis Severe vomiting and diarrhea can lead to marked fluid loss ( [dehydration](/home/hormonal-and-metabolic-disorders/water-balance/dehydration) [ Dehydration Dehydration is a deficiency of water in the body.

Diagnosis of Gastroenteritis A doctor's evaluation History of contact with ill people, certain animals, or contaminated food or water; recent travel; or antibiotic use Sometimes stool tests The diagnosis of gastroenteritis is usually obvious from the symptoms alone, but doctors consider other gastrointestinal disorders that cause similar symptoms (for example, [ulcerative colitis](/home/digestive-disorders/inflammatory-bowel-diseases-ibd/ulcerative-colitis) [ Ulcerative Colitis Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease in which the large intestine (colon) becomes inflamed and ulcerated (pitted or eroded), leading to flare-ups (bouts or attacks) of... read more ](/home/digestive-disorders/inflammatory-bowel-diseases-ibd/ulcerative-colitis) ). The cause of gastroenteritis often is not obvious and needs to be sought. Sometimes other family members or coworkers have recently been ill with similar symptoms, or people have had contact with certain animals. Other times, gastroenteritis can be traced to contaminated water or inadequately cooked, spoiled, or contaminated food, such as raw seafood or mayonnaise left out of the refrigerator too long. Recent travel, especially to certain foreign countries, and recent antibiotic use may give clues as well. If the symptoms are severe or last for more than 48 hours, stool samples may be examined in a laboratory for white blood cells and bacteria, viruses, or parasites. Seriously ill people may need blood tests to determine whether they have water and electrolyte imbalances or tests to determine how their kidneys are functioning. If the symptoms persist longer than expected, a doctor may need to examine the large intestine with a [sigmoidoscope](/home/digestive-disorders/diagnosis-of-digestive-disorders/endoscopy) [ Endoscopy Endoscopy is an examination of internal structures using a flexible viewing tube (endoscope).

Treatment of Gastroenteritis Fluids and rehydration solutions Sometimes medications Rehydration Usually the only treatment needed for gastroenteritis is getting bed rest and drinking an adequate amount of fluids. Even a person who is vomiting should drink as much as can be tolerated, taking small frequent sips. If vomiting or diarrhea is prolonged or the person becomes severely dehydrated, fluids and electrolytes given by vein (intravenously) may be needed. Because children can become dehydrated more quickly, they should be given fluids with the appropriate mix of salts and sugars. Any of the commercially available solutions designed to replace lost fluids and electrolytes (called [oral rehydration solutions](/home/children-s-health-issues/miscellaneous-disorders-in-infants-and-young-children/dehydration-in-children#v36027812) [ Treatment Dehydration is loss of water from the body, usually caused by vomiting and/or diarrhea.

Carbonated beverages, teas, sports drinks, beverages containing caffeine, and fruit juices are not appropriate. If the child is breastfed, [breastfeeding](/home/children-s-health-issues/care-of-newborns-and-infants/breastfeeding) [ Breastfeeding Breast milk is the ideal food for newborns. Although babies may be fed breast milk or formula, the World Health Organization (WHO) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommend exclusive... read more ](/home/children-s-health-issues/care-of-newborns-and-infants/breastfeeding) should continue. As the symptoms subside, the person may gradually add foods to the diet. Although often recommended, there is no need to limit the diet to bland foods such as cereal, gelatin, bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. However, some people are unable to tolerate milk products for a few days after having diarrhea. Medications A doctor may give adults antinausea medications, such as ondansetron, prochlorperazine, and promethazine, by mouth or as an injection or suppository. Children who are still vomiting after 24 hours need to be seen again by a doctor. If the diarrhea continues for 24 to 48 hours and there is no blood in the stool to indicate a more serious bacterial infection, the doctor may prescribe a medication to control the diarrhea, such as diphenoxylate, or instruct the person to use an over-the-counter medication, such as loperamide. These medications (called antidiarrheal medications) are not given to children under 18 years of age with acute diarrhea. Antidiarrheal medications are also not given to people who have recently used antibiotics, who have bloody diarrhea, who have small amounts of blood in the stool that are too small to be seen, or who have diarrhea and fever. Because antibiotics can cause diarrhea and may encourage the growth of organisms resistant to antibiotics, they are usually best avoided, even when a known bacterium is causing gastroenteritis. Antibiotics may be used, however, when certain bacteria, such as Campylobacter, Shigella, and Vibrio, are the cause, and for people who have [traveler's diarrhea](/home/digestive-disorders/gastroenteritis/travelers-diarrhea#v871272) [ Treatment Traveler's diarrhea is an infection characterized by diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting that commonly occur in travelers to areas of the world with poor water purification.

The antibiotic that is used for treatment is different from the antibiotic that caused the Clostridioides difficile infection. (See also table .) Did You Know... Parasitic infections are treated with antiparasitic medications such as metronidazole, tinidazole, and nitazoxanide. Probiotics Some bacteria are naturally found in the body and promote the growth of good bacteria (probiotics). The use of probiotics, such as lactobacillus (typically present in yogurt), may slightly shorten the duration of diarrhea (perhaps by less than a day). However, there is insufficient evidence that probiotics prevent more serious consequences of gastroenteritis, such as the need for intravenous fluids or for hospitalization, to support their routine use to treat or prevent infectious diarrhea.

Caregivers should wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing bottles for formula-fed infants. If soap and clean water are unavailable, an antibacterial hand sanitizer should be used. Caregivers should also wash their hands after changing diapers. Diaper-changing areas should be disinfected with a freshly prepared solution of household bleach (\u00bc cup bleach diluted in 1 gallon of water). Children with diarrhea should be excluded from day care centers for the duration of their symptoms. Children infected with E. coli that causes bloody diarrhea or Shigella should also have two negative stool tests before they are allowed to return to the center. Did You Know... Infants and other people with a weakened immune system should not be exposed to reptiles, birds, or amphibians, because these animals typically carry Salmonella bacteria, and infection is more severe in these groups of people. Because most infections that cause gastroenteritis are transmitted by person-to-person contact, particularly through direct or indirect contact with infected stool, good handwashing with soap and water after a bowel movement is the most effective means of prevention. To prevent foodborne infections, hands should be washed before touching food, knives and cutting boards used to cut raw meat should be washed before use with any other food, meat and eggs should be cooked thoroughly, and leftovers should be refrigerated promptly after cooking. Only pasteurized dairy products and pasteurized apple juice should be used. Travelers should try to avoid high-risk foods and beverages, such as those sold by street vendors. To prevent recreational water illness, people should not swim if they have diarrhea. Infants and toddlers should have frequent diaper checks and should be changed in a bathroom and not near the water. Swimmers should avoid swallowing water while swimming. Because use of most antibiotics can increase the risk of diarrhea caused by Clostridioides difficile infection, antibiotics are used only when necessary and never in situations in which they will have no effect (for example, for a viral infection).
