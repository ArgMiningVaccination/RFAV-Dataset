It has been reported that manymucoactive drugs have antioxidant effects. It is reasonable to suggest that an anti-inflammatory property is crucial to demonstrate effectiveness in a clinical context.From this point of view, we have evaluated several mucoactive drugs over twodecades. Of these, we will consider the following drugs with anti-inflammatoryproperties: sodium aceneuramate; glucocorticoids; traditional Chinese medicines;and new cysteine derivatives. On the basis of these findings, we believe that theefforts to seek for compatible actions between glucocorticoids and oriental medi-cines may provide new opportunities for development of ideal mucoactive drugswith specified actions, i.e. suppression of gene expression.

Miyata, mucus Received: February 24 1997 Accepted after revision February 26 1997 Disturbance of the normal mucociliary clearance due to hyperproduction of mucus and modification of itsphysicochemical characteristics is a common finding inairway diseases. Drugs that affect airway secretion havebeen proposed and used to cleanse the respiratory tractfor many centuries and in many countries. On the basisof the mechanism of their actions, the mucoactive drugswere classified into several groups [1]. Some mucoac-tive drugs have direct effects on the production or com-position of airway secretions, resulting in increasedeffectiveness of mucociliary clearance. The other muco-active drugs do not have a specific action on mucus,but have beneficial effects on airway structure and func-tion, which lead to correction of pathophysiologicalmechanisms that result in abnormal secretions. However, since many drugs have overlapping effects, it is difficult to classify these drugs into groups basedon their major actions. For example, it is well knownthat ambroxol stimulates the formation and release ofpulmonary surfactant by alveolar type II cells [2]. How-ever, recent indicate that ambroxol as well asN-acetyl- L-cysteine and carboxymethylcysteine could sufficiently enhance the antioxidant defense mechanismsin lung tissues and could act as lung lipid antioxidants[3-7]. In addition, ambroxol inhibited the chemotacticresponse and spontaneous migration of human poly-morphonuclear leucocytes (PMNLs) [8-10], and atten-uated the production of tumor necro-sis factor by human mononuclear cells [11]. In in vivo studies, ambroxol diminished the bleomycin-inducedlung injury in rats [12], and decreased mortality afteradministration of paraquat, a herbicide that generates re-active oxygen species [13]. It can be concluded that am-broxol has an anti-inflammatory action. Taken togetherwith previous findings of mucoactive drugs, it seems tous that the antioxidant effect is a common property inmucoactive drugs and that it is a crucial action to exerttheir effects against airway diseases. In the light of this idea, we must use specific exper- imental models to simulate pharmacological events inairway inflammation. Nowadays, the development ofnew techniques has made it possible to identify andmeasure the mucus components, to measure the rheo-logical parameters more accurately, and to evaluatemucociliary clearance precisely in animals and humans.Therefore, with modifications of methods, we have eval-uated mucoactive drugs from various points of view inorder to reflect actions in inflammatory states over twodecades. Here, we introduce the methods we have usedto study many of the parameters involved in airwayclearance, and we describe some of the mucoactive drugsthat we have studied recently.SERIES 'AIRWAY MUCUS' Edited by P .K.

(Reproduced permission from [22]).Screening systems for mucoactive drugs In vivo screening systems for airway secretion in inflam- mation There are several experimental models of airway in- flammation. Amongst these, we used a sulphur dioxide(SO 2) exposed model as an in vivo screening system for airway secretion in inflammation, because SO2mainly causes airway epithelial damage similar to features ofbronchitis. There are two convenient methods to studyairway secretion: the Perry and Boyd method [14, 15],and the bronchoalveolar lavage method. The Perry and Boyd method has been used extensively to study the effects of sympathetic or parasympatheticagents and the effects of many kinds of mucoactive drugs.In our previous studies, the mucous production of rabbitswith subacute bronchitis induced by a long-term expos-ure (5 weeks to 3 months) to SO 2(50-300 parts per mil- lion (ppm)) has been determined with this method. Wedetermined sugar, protein and phospholipid contents inairway secretions from normal and bronchitic rabbitsand effects of various mucoactive drugson airway secretion [16-21]. The majority of fucose, galactose, N-acetylgalac-tosamine, N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylneuraminicacid. As shown in table 1, we found that the sugars were increased in airway secretions of rabbits exposed to SO 2. The finding that there was a large increase in galactoseand N-acetylglucosamine is similar to that observed inthe sputum of bronchitic patients. The finding suggeststhat airway secretions from rabbits exposed to SO 2are composed of long chains of sugars in mucins, resultingin secretions with a viscous nature, similar to the sputaof bronchitic patients. The reason is that these two sug-ars are major components of the elongated sugars inmucins. Figure 1 shows the basis of the sugar structureof mucin. Bronchoalveolar lavage methods were also employed to study airway secretions. The advantage of this methodis that many components can be examined quantitativelyand qualitatively. For example, we examined the influ-ence of long-term exposure to SO 2on the pulmonary surfactant by this method [21]. Recently, in order toinvestigate immuno- studies, the antibodies recognized themucins secreted into the lumen, but not those stored assay (ELISA) shown that the antibodies react with some mucinsfrom hamster intestine and swine stomach, and bron-choalveolar lavages of rats, guinea-pigs, dogs and humans.However, the antibodies did not recognize bovine sub-maxillary gland mucins or proteoglycans (fig. 3 and table2). Therefore, ELISA, using the antibodies, could be app-lied to quantify airway mucin production in future muco-active drug screening studies.CURRENT STATUS OF MUCUS DRUG DEVELOPMENT 481 Table 1. - Sugar components of airway secretions in normal and bronchitic rabbits airway secretion in inflam- mation For drug evaluation, we used two kinds of in vitro model to evaluate mucoactive drugs. To investigatemucous secretions as a major component of the gel layerof airway secretions, we have used culture systems ofhamster tracheal epithelial cells or human pulmonarymucoepidermoid carcinoma cell lines (NCl-H292). Toinvestigate pulmonary surfactant as a major componentof the sol layer, we have used primary culture of rat alv-eolar type II cells. K IMand co-workers [23, 24] have re- ported that ham ster tracheal epithelial cells in culture are morphologically and biochemically similar to goblet cells. Using this system, it has been reported that the secretion of high molecular weight glycoconjugates (HMWG), amarker of mucus, is not influenced by as acetylcholine or histamine, but is influ- enced by alteration of the pH and osmolarity of the medi- um, cationic proteases, mechanical strain of cells and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) [25-29]. We found that pro- tein was involved in HMWG secretion in ham-ster tracheal epithelial cells in adrenergic agonists suppressed HMWGsecretion in hamster tracheal epithelial cells (table 3).To simulate an inflammatory state, we have used co- culture systems of mucous cells with polymorphonuclearleucocytes (PMNLs) activated by several stimuli [31, 32].Abnormal and excessive mucous secretion is a character-istic feature of many chronic inflammatory lung diseases,accompanied by the influx of PMNLs into the airwayand release of substance P (SP) from the peripheral end-ings of primary sensory neurons. We examined whetherPMNLs activated by SP (10 mM) can affect the secre-tion of HMWG from cultured hamster tracheal epithelialcells. We HMWG. SP-activated PMNLs (10 HMWG to 76% ofthe control level, but did not affect the amount of the re-leased HMWG. The reduction of the amount of cell-associated HMWG was inhibited by ONO-5046, a specificelastase inhibitor (fig. 4). In addition, the HMWG wasdigested by the activated PMNLs. These findings sug-gested that SP stimulated the release of cell-associatedHMWG, which was then degraded by elastase releasedfrom PMNLs activated by SP. As suggested in many re-ports, we indicated that neutrophil elastase may be a cru-cial mediator to induce mucous secretion in inflammation. Pulmonary surfactant, which is composed of phos- pholipids and apoproteins and is mainly produced inalveolar type II cells, lowers the surface tension at theair-liquid interface in the lung and provides alveolar sta-bility. D ESANCTIS et al. [33] clearly demonstrated that, in addition to the vital role, surfactants were also impor-tant in airway mucociliary clearance. Several studieshave suggested that the presence of phospholipids in theairways may modify the clearance of mucus [34-39].The existence of surfactant films has been demonstrat-ed in the airways of several species by electron microscopy[36, 40], and by in situ surface tension measurement [36, 41]. We also confirmed a protective effect of sur-face active phospholipids on an acid-inducing inhibitionof mucociliary transport in pigeons [42]. Taken together with many reports on pulmonary sur- factant in mucociliary clearance, it is reasonable to studythe effects of mucoactive drugs on pulmonary surfactantsecretion in alveolar type II cells. Secretion of phos-phatidylcholine, a major surfactant phospholipid, hasbeen shown to be influenced by a variety of physiolo-gical and pharmacological agents in alveolar type II cells[43, 44]. We also found that both 1- and 2-adreno- ceptor subtypes mediated phosphatidylcholine secretionT.

To simulate inflammatory states, we have used co-cul- ture systems of alveolar type II cells [47, 48]. Activated PMNLs and eosinophilsin airway epithelium are thought to be involved in thepathogenesis of many airway diseases. PMNLs or eosino-phils activated by zymosan caused a signific-ant increase in phosphatidylcholine secretion. Pretreatment of the culture with the combination of superoxide dismu-tase and catalase reduced the increase in phosphatidyl-choline secretion (data on acti vated eosinophils shown in figures 6 and 7). These results suggested that activatedPMNLs and eosinophils stimulated the secretion of pul-monary surfactant, and that the stimulation was partly me-diated by oxygen radicals. These systems may be usefulto assay the antioxidant effects of mucoactive drugs,although it remains unclear whether the increased pul-monary surfactant plays a defensive role in inflamma-tion. Mucociliary transport in inflammation Mucociliary clearance is an important pulmonary de- fense mechanism that serves to remove inhaled sub-stances from the lung [49]. The mucociliary function isdepressed by a variety of water-soluble atmospheric pol-lutants such as SO 2and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) [49]. The techniques for in vivo measurement of mucous trans- port rates involve the placement of an optically, radio-graphically, or scintigraphically detectable solid or liquidmarker on the mucosa [50]. 483 Table 4. - Effect of -adrenoceptor antagonists on - adrenoceptor agonist-induced secretion of [3H]phos- phatidylcholine as the amount of [3H]phosphatidyl- choline in the medium as a percentage of that in cells plusmedium at the end of the incubation period.

A major reason for the use of birds is basedon histological findings and biochemical study of bron-choalveolar lavages. As shown in figure 8, the histolog-ical features are similar to airway inflammatory states,because there are many proliferated goblet cells and sub-mucosal glands in tracheal epithelium. of birds, extremely fucose, a typical sugar in mucins, was found(table 5). So far, we have examined the effects of manymucoactive drugs on mucociliary clearance in birds [16,19, 42, 51-58]. For example, we found that inhalationof bromhexine, classified as a mucolytic agent, increasedmucociliary transport in quails (fig. 9). Recently, we the effect of leukotriene D 4(LTD4) on muco- ciliary transport in quails [58]. As shown in figure topical application of LTD 4(0.2-2 ng) to tracheal mucosa resulted in a dose-dependent increase in muco-ciliary transport 5 or 10 min after the application. Fortyminutes after the application of 2 ng of LTD 4, the muco- ciliary transport was decreased to about 84% of that in484 3H-PC secretion % 30 60 1050 Time min90b) 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0220 200 180 160 140 120 100 80PC secretion % control Control 104 105 106 Eosinophils na) Fig. 6. - a) Phosphatidylcholine secretion from rat alveolar type II cells in response to the number of activated eosinophils by opsonizedzymosan (100 mg\u00b7mL -1).

Moreover, we found that ofhistamine (1 pmol) to tracheal mucosa markedly decreas-ed mucociliary transport 5 or 10 min after the application.The inhibitory effect was prevented by the anti-allergicdrug ketotifen (fig. 11). In preliminary experiments, we found that sphingomye- lin-rich lipid fractions from sputa suppressed mucocil iarytransport in the trachea [59]. Although the mechanism of action remains unclear, the finding suggests that wehave to consider composition of phospholipids in sputaas inhibitory factors of mucociliary clearance. Current mucoactive drugs We have evaluated several mucoactive drugs over two decades. Of these, we introduce here the following drugswith anti-inflammatory properties: sodium aceneuramate;glucocorticoids; traditional Sodium aceneuramate (N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA) sodium salt) Although the participation of sialic acids, mainly NANA, in many biological and pathological processeshas been well documented [60], there are only a fewstudies concerning the significance of the sialic acid inthe airway [61]. Using a selected ion monitoring tech-nique, we found that the sputa of bronchitic rabbits con-tained much higher levels of both free and bound NANAthan the airway secretions of normal rabbits [62, 63].In addition, we found that NANA concentrations in those in the bronchoalveolar lavagesof healthy subjects. Furthermore, we have reported thatan inhalation of NANA repaired inflammation in theairway (fig. 12), and caused bronchitic rabbits to pro-duce sputa with a low 63]. notlactose, impaired bycigarette smoke in a dose-dependent manner (fig. 13)[54].

The clinical observations that NANA is an effectiveinhalant expectorant seem to support our findings [65,66]. We administered NANA (2 mg, b.i.d. for 7 days) by inhalation to ten patients with bronchiectasis, chronicbronchitis, diffuse panbronchiolitis and other respiratorydiseases that cause sputa [66]. We found that NANA im-proved subjective symptoms, such as the expectorationand sticking sensation of sputa. The viscosity of sputawas increased in four patients and the ratio of disatur-ated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC)/phosphatidylcholine(PC) was increased in five patients, but protein contentswere decreased in four patients whose subjective sympt-oms were improved. NANA did not cause any side-effectsor abnormal laboratory findings. Therefore, it is possi-ble that NANA improved the subjective respiratory symp-toms due to Glucocorticoids Glucocorticoids are first-choice drugs in the man- agement of the inflammatory process seen in asthma.Although current pharmacological approaches to air-way mucus production are limited, glucocorticoids seemto be the most effective among a few useful drugs.However, there are a few studies documenting the ben-efits of glucocorticoid therapy on the mucociliary clear-ance and the excessive production of airway mucus.Systemic administration of glucocorticoids amelioratedbronchial obstruction and facilitated expectoration inpatients with asthma althoughthey did whereas appli-cation of beclomethasone had no effect on mucociliarytransport in conscious sheep [67]. Thus, the contribu-tion of glucocorticoids to mucociliary transport remainsunclear. We previously examined the effect of cortico-sterone on tracheal transport in mucociliary transport inhib-itory action was blocked by 1.0 mg\u00b7kg -1of corticosterone. The findings suggested that glucocorticoids modulatedthe mucociliary clearance, especially in diseases assoc-iated with a decreased level of endogenous corticoster-oids. With regard to effects on mucous production, several reports have shown that glucocorticoids directly reducesubmucosal gland secretions [69-72] without the synthesis of mucins [71]. Recentlywe tried to clarify the effect of dexamethasone on mucusproduction and mucin gene expression in a human pul-monary mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell line (NCI-H292)[73]. Dexamethasone (10 [3H] serine-labelled HMWG in NCI-H292 cells (data not shown). To examine the effect on mucin gene exp-ression, we have selected mucin genes (MUC-1-MUC-8) [74-86], becauseMUC-2 was expressed in the airways of patients with in-flammatory airway disorders, such as cystic fibrosis andchronic bronchitis [87-90], because MUC-5 was In (10 genes (data shown). weconcluded that the basal pro-duction of HMWG of mucin genes in airway mucus-producing can-cer cells. Traditional Chinese medicines There is an increasing usage of traditional Chinese herbal medicines in clinics and hospitals, because theytend to have moderate side-effects and sometimes pro-duce remarkable efficacy. In order to renormalize over-all defects in airway disorders, Chinese medicines maybe adequate drugs, because the medicines are composedof various herbs with weak, but ubiquitous pharmaco-logical activities.

Qing-Fei-Tang has been clinically applied in the treatment of chronic obstructivepulmonary diseases with severe cough and sputum. Qing- Fei-Tang was also effective for the treatment of the bronchitis with an asthmatic attack-like symptom [91].In this patient, the abnormally elevated chemilumines-cence of oxygen radicals in leucocytes was normalizedas symptoms improved during administration of Qing- Fei-Tang for 5 weeks. Our previous study showed that Qing-Fei-Tang inhibited the release of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis from passively sensitized guinea-pig lung after antigen challenge [59].

In the bronchitic rabbits, administra-tion of Qing-Fei-Tang for 6 weeks restored the decreased amount of saturated fatty acid in the sputa, and histo-logical examinations revealed an amelioration of the in-flammation of lung tissues. In pigeons, Qing-Fei-Tang facilitated tra cheal mucociliary transport. Accordingly, Qing-Fei-Tang seems to exert effectiveness viaits mul- tiple mechanisms. Mai-men-Dong-Tang. As another Chinese traditional medicine, we have investigated Mai-men-Dong-Tang , con- for the treatment of bronchitis and pharyngitis accompany-ing severe dry cough. We found that unlike codeine, Mai- men-Dong-Tang had a notable antitussive activity against the cough associated with bronchitis and the coughincreased by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors[92]. Recently, type II cells,Mai-men-Dong-Tang attenuated phosphatidylcholine secretion increased by oxygen radicals from activatedPMNLs. In addition, we found that Mai-men-Dong-Tang by itself, slightly stimulated phosphatidylcholine secre-tion (fig. 17) and increased 1-adrenoceptor gene exp- ression in rat alveolar type II cells. The mechanism ofaction remains unclear, but the effect may contribute toits effectiveness in the treatment of airway diseases. New cysteine derivatives We are developing a new cysteine derivative, S-(3- L-cysteine (SS320A), rabbits, SS320A significantly increasedpulmonary secretion of the marker dye, indicating bron-chosecretagogue activity. In addition, SS320A increasedthe volume of airway secretions in normal rabbits col-lected by the Perry and Boyd method.

SS320A (500 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7day, p.o., 2 the decreased content of free sialic acidin bronchoalveolar lavages in animals with bronchitisinduced 2exposure. SS320A inhibit- ed the hyperplasia of quails, restored the mucociliary transport impairedby cigarette smoke exposure. The results suggest thiol derivative with mucolytic,mucomodulatory and free radical scavenging properties,and without gastric adverse effects, unlike other cysteinederivatives [94]. We found that erdosteine (600 mg\u00b7kg -1, mucociliary transport in quails and suppressed capsaicin-induced cough reflex[95]. Several studies reported of the lysine, the com-pounds are better tolerated by the gastroenteric tract thanother mucoactive drugs. This allows the administrationof the drug at higher doses, resulting in more effective-ness of the drugs in clinical use. We are also investiga-ting the cysteine derivatives in our systems. Future directions Various parameters (chemical properties, physical properties, mucous production, surfactant phospholipidproduction, and mucociliary clearance) are consideredto be important for the dynamics and the mobilizationof airway secretions. Pharmacological investigation, withappropriate techniques, of the ability of an agent to mod-ify these parameters can provide useful information aboutits mechanism of action. However, since these parame-ters are strictly interconnected, it is very complicated toelucidate the precise mechanism of action of mucoac-tive drugs. This means that the goal of the treatmentcannot always be achieved by the modification of a sin-gle parameter, but should, more realistically, be aimedat a renormalization of several parameters. On the basisof this idea, it will be taken for granted that glucocorti-coids are ideal mucoactive drugs, because they possessvarious pharmacological effects in the lung. From poly-pharmacological points of view, a traditional Chinesemedicine can be classified as a glucocorticoid-like drugbecause Chinese medicines consist of many kinds ofactive components that have various pharmacologicaleffects. As one future course of research, we believe that the efforts to seek compatible actions between glucocorti-coids and oriental medicines may lead us to a new oppor-tunity for development of ideal mucoactive drugs withspecified actions, i.e. suppression of gene expression.
