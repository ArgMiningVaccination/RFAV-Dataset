Whether you need to lose 2 lbs or 400 lbs, you are welcome here! I'm 29y F, 170lbs, 5\"6, and I've been trying to loose weight since 2020. I love exercising. I lift weights, hot yoga, YouTube workouts and occasionally run. I really struggle with \"cleaning up my diet\". What does this mean to people on this board? Is there tips to feel full on these more \"clean\" foods, and making them at home. An example of what I eat: B- protein oatmeal with fruits, OR egg white omelette with veggies L- sandwich + meat, or bagel + smoked salmon (or leftovers if available) D- pasta + meat or tacos or baked chicken burger But even after eating \"decent\" all day I CRAVE sweats so end up having ice cream or cupcake at the end of the day. I also crave fast food or take out for its convenience "}
