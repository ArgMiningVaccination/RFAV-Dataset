Guided Meditation for Energy: 10 Minutes Meditation Script for Energy Practice this meditation while sitting on a chair, feet planted firmly on the floor, and spine in straight alignment. Take a moment to adjust your sit bones so they feel even on either side. Truly allowing each vertebra to stack one on top of the other as your head with your chin in a neutral position, allowing your palms to rest in your lap, facing upwards and gently closing your eyes. In this meditation, you will be practicing a style of breath that is designed to help you bring more energy into your body. If at any point you feel light-headed or tired, just return to breathing at a pace that is comfortable for you. Never push yourself. If you are feeling lightheaded, just relax and let yourself breathe regularly. If that occurs, you can always return to the style of breath you will be taught after you have allowed yourself to breathe steadily again. That said, you may not experience any lightheadedness at all. Everyone is different. Just trust your body, listen to it, and practice the breath as it feels right to you. Begin by breathing in through your nose with your stomach expanding, and then feel your chest expand and then exhale powerfully through your mouth. It should sound like this. (Breathing noises) you will continue this cycle of breathing throughout the course of this meditation, listening to this music and allowing yourself to get lost in your breath and the music. You can go with the rhythm of the song you were hearing and just allow your body to feel the energy flowing through you, uplifting you, and bringing you into a state of positive energy and bliss. Speeding up. Now, if it feels right to you. (Breathing example) In, in, out, in, in, out, in, in, out and in, in, out. You're doing great. Keep going. Stay present with your breath. I feel a sense of positive energy flowing all within an around you as you keep breathing, letting the pace be comfortable for you and fun. Breathing in through your stomach and then in through your chest and then out through your mouth in rhythm with the drums, losing yourself in the rhythm. Feeling a very primal energy, uplifting, expanding. Keep going. You're doing fantastic. Just a little longer now. Keep going. Really make this count. Feel the energy building, growing, expanding on your next inhale at yourself. Breathe in all of the air that you possibly can. Feeling your entire stomach and rib cage expand and hold it at the top. And as you hold your breath, feel all of the energy that you've built up inside of you and when it feels right to you, exhale powerfully through your mouth, shaking your shoulders, your hands, your feet, moving your body to the rhythm of the drums. Noticing how all of the energy has built up inside of you, and take this energy with you as you open your eyes, feeling empowered, energetic, and blissful. Energy Meditation: 20 Minutes Energy Meditation Script Welcome to this meditation to bring forth massive amounts of natural energy. This session includes some guidance, but mostly you will be allowed to meditate on your own, as you enjoy the beautiful music. Get into a seated position, preferably on the floor with a cushion, sitting with a long and straight spine... make sure your clothing is loose around the waist to allow for ample breathing... if you need your back supported by a chair, or if you would like to lay down, you may do so... it is best to continue this meditation with eyes closed. Begin by taking 3 deep breaths to center yourself in this practice.... Feeling your body expanding and contracting as you inhale and exhale... (pause) Now, imagine that all around you is the energy of the universe. This is an eternal truth that energy is always around us, in some form or another... energy cannot be destroyed or created, it can only change from one thing to another... (pause) Imagining that the air around you is filled with bright and vibrant energy.... You can see it however you'd like... perhaps it presents itself as a color... or a substance... (pause) Take a deep breath in and inhale the energy that is surrounding you.... Taking it deep within your lungs, being transferred to your entire body... (pause) Energy is being transformed right now to every part of your being... (pause) Breathe in deeply again, pulling in the force of life that is floating in the air.... (pause) Each breath you take you are soaking in the vital life force... (pause) Breathe in the revitalizing energy that is all around you, it is simply waiting for you to access it... (pause) Now, begin to focus on the base of your spine... the tailbone, where you sit into your meditation position... this is called the root and it is where you are grounded to the earth.... (pause) Imagine that you are pulling in the eternal energy from mother earth, through the base of your spine... (pause) Bringing this energy very slowly up the body, allowing it to relax you and energize you at the same time... (pause) Continue to breathe deeply, and notice how the powerful sensations are traveling up the body, restoring your body to perfect order and synchronicity... (pause) As you breathe, this exhilarating feeling is traveling all the way up to the top of your head, and imagine that as it makes its way, it bursts out of your crown, lighting up the heavens with your energy... (pause) You are breathing new life into every cell of your physical body... (pause) You are reviving your spirit and connecting to all there is... (pause) See yourself connected to the earth as well as connected to the heavens.... (pause) You are fully restored to the natural state of your being... feeling replenished and full of powerful, natural energy... (pause) Gently returning your awareness to the present moment, rise from your meditation in your own time, ready to take on the day with newfound energy. "}
