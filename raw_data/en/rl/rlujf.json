Two prescription medicines, ami-fostine and dexrazoxane, both antioxidants, reduce cancer thera-py side effects without interfering with antitumor killing.Amifostine (WR-2721) is an antioxidant analog of cysteaminethat was discovered by the armed forces at Walter Reed ArmyMedical Center, Washington, DC, and became the first antioxi-dant agent to be approved by international regulatory agencies. 6 According to 29 studies, amifostine reduces side effects andincreases response rates of chemotherapy and radiation therapywithout interfering with their antitumor killing activity. 6-18 Twenty-one studies indicate that dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) the toxicity without interfering withthe antitumor effect 19-22by chelating iron that would otherwise form free radicals.23-26 Despite the common use of amifostine and dexrazoxane, and in direct opposition to clear scientific findings since the 1970s,Charles B.

Part 2 will appear in the March/April 2007 issue of Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine. Two of every 5 Americans will develop cancer, and theincidence of most cancers has increased annuallysince 1930. 1-5In addition, since 1930, despite the use of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunothera-py, and improved surgical and diagnostic tech- niques, there has been limited improvement in cancer survivalPurpose Some in the oncology community contend that patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation therapyshould not use food supplement antioxidants and other nutri-ents. Oncologists at an influential oncology institution contend-ed that antioxidants interfere with radiation and somechemotherapies because those modalities kill by generating freeradicals that are neutralized by antioxidants, and that folic acidinterferes with methotrexate. This is despite the common use ofamifostine and dexrazoxane, 2 prescription antioxidants, duringchemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.Design To assess all evidence concerning antioxidant and other nutrients used concomitantly with chemotherapy and/orradiation therapy, the MEDLINE\u00ae and CANCERLIT\u00ae databaseswere searched from 1965 to November 2003 using the words vit- amins, antioxidants, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy . Bibliographies of articles were searched. All studies reportingconcomitant nutrient use with chemotherapy and/or radiationtherapy (280 peer-reviewed articles including 62 in vitro and 218 in vivo) were indiscriminately included.Results Fifty human clinical randomized or observational trials have been conducted, involving 8,521 patients usingbeta-carotene; vitamins A, C, and E; selenium; vita-mins; vitamin D 3; vitamin K3; and glutathione as single agents or in combination.Conclusion s Since the 1970s, 280 peer-reviewed in vitro and in vivo studies, including 50 human studies involving 8,521patients, 5,081 of whom were given nutrients, have consistentlyshown that non-prescription antioxidants and other nutrientsdo not interfere with therapeutic modalities for cancer.Furthermore, they enhance the killing of therapeutic modalitiesfor cancer, decrease their side effects, and protect normal tissue.In 15 human studies, 3,738 patients who took non-prescriptionantioxidants and other nutrients actually had increased survival.(Altern Ther Health Med . 2007;13(1):22-28.)original resear chAntioxidants and Other Nutrients With Chemotherapy, Radiation Therapy ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, jan/feb 2007, VOL. 13, NO. 1 23enhance the immune system and protect normal cells from the harm of radiation and other destructive mechanisms.Glutathione peroxidase, a selenium-containing antioxidantenzyme complex, protects the cell from injury.Glutathione peroxidase is easier to measure than selenium andhas the advantage of assessing only biologically active selenium.Vitamin A and retinoids have anti-cancer effects, repair normalcells, and modulate the growth and differentiation of malignantcells. Vitamin D 3inhibits cancer cell proliferation and replica- tion, induces differentiation of leukemia cells, inhibits the onco-gene c- myc , and enhances the immune system. Vitamin K 3 (menadione) inhibits cell growth, cell proliferation, DNA synthe- sis, and the cell cycle. Vitamin K3acts on apoptosis through expression of c- myc and c- fosproto-oncogenes and lowers intra- cellular pools of reduced glutathione. Effects of Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy on Serum Nutrient Levels Cancer patients suffer from caloric and nutritional malnutri- tion and have vitamin deficiencies, particularly of folic acid, vita-min C, pyridoxine, and other nutrients because of poor nutritionand treatment. 38Chemotherapy and radiation therapy reduce serum levels of antioxidant vitamins and minerals due to lipid per-oxidation and thus produce higher levels of oxidative stress. 36-66Iron could be the intermediate cause of this oxidative stress.20-23 Therefore, supplemental iron should not be recommended to can-cer patients who have anemia unless it is an iron-deficiency anemia.many patients have been told not to use food supplement antioxi-dants and other nutrients while undergoing chemotherapy and/orradiation therapy because there is an erroneous but seemingly log-ical belief that antioxidants interfere with radiation and somechemotherapies because those modalities kill by generating freeradicals that are neutralized by antioxidants, and another erro-neous belief that folic acid interferes with methotrexate. 27-32 In an article that appeared on the front page of The New York Times on October 26, 1997, Larry Norton, MD, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New Y ork, was quoted as saying,\"Research at [Memorial Sloan Kettering] showed that largedoses of vitamin C could blunt the beneficial effects ofchemotherapy for breast cancer. . . . It is also known that folicacid can negate the effects of methotrexate, a drug used to treatcancer.\" 27The research referred to was finally published almost 2 years later and demonstrated only the mechanism by which can-cer cells obtain vitamin C and that more vitamin C was found inmice cancer cells compared to normal mice cells. 29However, the senior author of that paper stated in a news release on the day ofpublication (September 15, 1999), \"It's possible that taking largeamounts of vitamin C could interfere with the effects ofchemotherapy or even radiation therapy.\" 30So a single interview in The New York Times in 1997 that was not based on published scientific work and a single research paper involving mice, alongwith a press release by its author in 1999, led to the erroneousnotion that vitamin C interferes with chemotherapy and radia-tion in humans. This notion soon applied to all antioxidants asphysicians, patients, the media, the American Cancer Society, 31,32 and scores of websites took the same position without reviewingthe scientific evidence. This 2-part article presents the scientific data that antioxi- dants do not interfere with chemotherapy and/or radiation thera-py. Furthermore, it is not folic acid that interferes with the actionof methotrexate, but rather folinic acid, a prescription drug that isneither a vitamin nor an antioxidant. 33-35This article reviews data about vitamin A, beta-carotene, and vitamin E. Part 2 will reviewdata about antioxidant combinations, B vitamins, vitamins D 3 and K3, and the glutathione-selenium complex. METHODS MEDLINE\u00ae and CANCERLIT\u00ae searches were done using key words: vitamins, antioxidants, chemotherapy, and radiationtherapy. All studies reporting food supplement nutrients usedconcomitantly with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapywere indiscriminately included; however, in cases in which anauthor had published his or her findings in multiple sources,only the most recently published paper was used as it usuallycontained the greatest number of patients. BACKGROUND Radiation and certain chemotherapies produce cellular kill by generating free radicals; antioxidants neutralize free radicals andthe oxidative reactions that are caused by free radicals (Table 1). Other nutrients are included in this review. B vitaminsTABLE 1 Agents That Generate or Neutralize Free Radicals Generate Free Radicals Alkylating Agents 2007, VOL. 13, NO. 1 Antioxidants and Other Nutrients With Chemotherapy, Radiation TherapyEarly Studies Five early studies showed that N-acetyl cysteine, an antioxi- dant, protects the heart from the cardiac toxicity of adriamycinwithout interfering with the tumor-killing capability of adri-amycin. 67Seven cellular studies,68-7022 animal studies,71-75and human studies76-78have demonstrated that vitamins A, E, C, and K, as well as beta-carotene and selenium\u2014as single agents or incombination\u2014all protect against the toxicity of adriamycin andactually enhance its cancer-killing effects. Cellular and Animal Studies Fifty-one cellular 79-88and 81 animal studies89-110using nutrients that include vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, E, and K, beta-carotene, other retinoids, selenium, or cysteine as single agents or in combi-nation given concomitantly with chemotherapy, radiation, orcombinations of these modalities show the same effect\u2014no inter-ference, increased protection of normal tissues, increased tumorkilling, and, in some studies, increased animal survival. Observational Versus Randomized Clinical Studies Compared to randomized studies, observational studies are less costly, can be done more quickly, and have a broader rangeof patients. Observational studies provide valid information andvirtually the same results as randomized studies, a finding that dif-fers from previous conclusions. 111,112Furthermore, \"Observational studies do not overestimate the magnitude of the effects of treatment compared with those in randomized trials on thesame topic.\" 113(p1887)In this 2-part article, we will summarize 50 human studies, 36 observational and 14 randomized, thatreported concomitant nutrient use with chemotherapy and/orradiation therapy. Review of Human Studies Fifty human studies, involving 8,521 patients, have been conducted using single or multiple nutrients in combinationwith systemic treatment and/or radiation treatment and demon-strate that nutrients do not interfere with treatment. In fact, 47of these 50 studies indicated that nutrients decrease side effectsof treatment, and the other 3 studies showed no difference. Inaddition, many of the studies reported that nutrients producehigher response rates and higher survival rates when adminis-tered concomitantly with chemotherapy and/or radiation thera-py. This part of the 2-part article reviews data about vitamin A,beta-carotene, and vitamin E. 114-130 VITAMIN A (RETINYL PALMITATE) In a randomized study of 100 postmenopausal breast carcinoma undergoing chemotherapy(cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, bleomycin, adriamycin, mit-omycin), patients were given daily doses of vitamin A (350,000-500,000 IU, according to body weight). Vitamin A\u2014which manypeople erroneously believe is an antioxidant\u2014significantlyincreased the complete response rate, duration of response, andprojected survival. 114In an observational study of 275 patients with head and neck cancer, patients were treated with 5-fluorouracil and cobalt-60 radiation, as well as vitamin A. Vitamin A enhanced the cellu-lar sensitivity to irradiation, increased treatment response rate,and lowered toxic side effects. 115 In a randomized study of 153 patients with chronic myel- ogenous leukemia (CML), patients were randomized to receivepulse oral busulfan with or without the daily administration oforal vitamin A (50,000 IU). Patients receiving only busulfan hada shorter survival, with a 42% greater risk of death. In addition toincreasing survival, vitamin A decreased side effects andincreased treatment response rate. 116 In an observational study of 40 patients with stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer, patients were treated withcisplatin (120 mg/m 2divided into 5 days), vindesine (3 mg/m2 on days 1 and 5), 5-flourouracil (500 mg/m2on days 1 and 5), beta-interferon (1 million IU 3 times a week), and retinyl palmi-tate (50,000 IU twice a day). Vitamin A produced fewer sideeffects, a higher response rate, and increased survival comparedto historical controls. 117 In an observational study, 23 patients with unresectable or recurrent advanced oral cavity cancer were treated with 5-flourouracil (1,000 mg/m 2) and cisplatin (20 mg/m2) for 5 days. Vitamin A (15,000 IU twice a day) was also given throughout thetreatment. Vitamin A decreased side effects, increased responserate, and slightly increased survival. 118 In an observational study of 36 patients with stage IV breast cancer, patients were treated with cyclophosphamide, 5-flourouracil, 4-epidoxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone every3 weeks for 6 courses, followed by 2 courses of methotrexate,mitomycin-C, and mitoxantrone. Treatment continued withtamoxifen and vitamin A. Sixty-four percent of patients had aclinical response, 19% had stable disease, and side effects wereminimal. Median overall survival was 32 months. These resultscompare favorably with historical controls. 119 In an observational study of 22 patients with unresectable and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer, patients were mitomycin-C (10 mg/m2), interferon (1 million IU/m23 times a week), and vitamin A (50,000 IU twice a day). Response rates and survival were similar to his-torical controls. 120 In an observational study of 49 patients with metastatic breast cancer, 33 were treated with tamoxifen (30 mg/d), inter-feron (1 million IU 3 times a week), and vitamin A (15,000 IUtwice a day). Sixteen patients were treated with tamoxifen (30mg/d), interferon (3 million IU 3 times a week), and vitamin A(50,000 IU twice a day). There was no statistically significant dif-ference in the response rate, response duration, or survival in the2 groups treated with different dose levels of vitamin A and inter-feron. Compared to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and EndResults (SEER) Program data of the National Cancer Institute,however, these patients had a higher response rate and longersurvival with fewer side effects. 121Antioxidants and Other Nutrients With Chemotherapy, Radiation Therapy ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, jan/feb 2007, VOL. 13, NO. 1 25BETA-CAROTENE In a randomized study of 20 patients with advanced squa- mous carcinoma of the mouth, patients were given 60 Gy cobaltradiation therapy in 30 fractions. The week before and after radi-ation, and also during the third and sixth weeks of radiation,patients were given synchronous injections of chemotherapyconsisting of vincristine (2 mg), methotrexate (200 mg), andbleomycin (30 mg). Patients were randomized to receive supple-mental beta-carotene (250 mg for days 1-21; 75 mg daily there-after). No toxic side effects of beta-carotene were observed.Patients who received supplemental beta-carotene had lesssevere acute mucosal reactions. 122 In an observational study of 15 patients treated with chemotherapy for various advanced cancers, patients were givenchemotherapy/radiation therapy and beta-carotene. Beta-carotene decreased side effects and allowed for a longer thanexpected disease-free interval in all surviving patients. 123 VITAMIN E (ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL) In an observational study of 66 patients with transfusion- dependent myelodysplastic syndrome, patients received eitherhigh-dose 13-cis-retinoic acid only or high-dose 13-cis-retinoicacid with alpha-tocopherol. Patients who received alpha-toco-pherol had decreased measures of skin and constitutional toxici-ties and were able to achieve longer treatment continuation with13-cis-retinoic acid. As a result, fewer of these patients experi-enced progression to acute leukemia (28%) when compared topatients who received 13-cis-retinoic acid only (60%). A 2-foldincrease in median survival also was observed in the group treat-ed with vitamin E. 124 In an observational study of 39 patients with head and neck, skin, or lung cancer, study participants were treated withhigh-dose 13-cis-retinoic acid (100 mg/m 2orally per day) and alpha-tocopherol administered in escalating dose schedules of800, 1200, 1600, and 2000 IU per day for each subsequent 4-week treatment cycle. Over a 3-month period, patients experi-enced fewer grade 2 and grade 3 toxicities from high-dose13-cis-retinoic acid without altering its plasma concentration. 125 In an observational study of 17 patients with myelodyspla- sia, patients were treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (45 mg/m2 in 2 divided doses), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (start-ed at 1 microgram/kg per day), erythropoietin (5,000 IU per daystarting on day 2), and vitamin E (400 IU per day). Vitamin Ereduced the toxicity and increased the response rate withoutaffecting the performance of all-trans-retinoic acid. 126 In an observational study involving 1 patient, the patient developed a skin carcinoma in a chest wall scar from having amastectomy and radiation therapy 17 years earlier. After surgicalexcision of the carcinoma, she was treated with radiation therapyto the site. She also was given a vasodilator (pentoxifylline 1,200mg/d) and vitamin E (400 IU per day) in an attempt to reducethe new scar formation. The authors concluded that vitamin Edecreased the side effects of radiation, and the skin conditionbegan to improve by the fourth month. 127In an observational study of 21 patients with metastatic breast cancer, patients had endomyocardial biopsies and weregiven alpha-tocopherol orally at 2 g/m 7 days before cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and 5-fluorouracil admin-istration. Vitamin E did not compromise the antitumor activity ofthe chemotherapy. Fifteen of 21 achieved an objective response\u2014similar to the authors' previous experience. Vitamin E allowed foran additional 100 mg/m 2of adriamycin to be given, but the authors stated that vitamin E did not protect the heart.45 In a randomized study of 12 patients with metatstatic breast cancer, patients were treated with doxorubicin as an intra-venous bolus infusion (60 mg/m 2), and 6 were randomized to receive 200 mg alpha-tocopherol given intramuscularly 6 hoursbefore infusion and 60 mg nifedipine given orally each day for 2days before treatment. A higher response rate was achieved andcardiac toxicity was prevented in those who received vitamin Eand nifedipine. 46 In a randomized study of 20 patients with acute myeloge- nous leukemia, patients were given vitamin E daily and treatedwith induction chemotherapy (10 patients) and intensivechemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation (10patients). Vitamin E increased treatment response rate and pre-vented mucositis\u2014an inflammatory response of the oral cavitycaused by radiation therapy\u2014especially during induction thera-py for acute myelogenous leukemia. 128 In a randomized study of 18 patients with various cancers, patients received chemotherapy appropriate for their cancer siteand were randomized to receive either placebo oil or topical vita-min E (400 IU/cc) to control mucositis. For the 16 patients withhead and neck cancer, 5-fluorouracil (1,000 mg/m 2as a continu- ous infusion for 5 days) and cisplatin (100 mg/m2on day 2) were given. For the patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, doxoru-bicin (45 mg/m 2every 3 weeks) was given. The patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) received Ara-C (100mg/m 2/d for doxorubicin (45 mg/m2on days 1-3). Oral mucositis lesions were observed daily before and 5 daysafter the application of either vitamin E or placebo oil. Vitamin Eprevented chemotherapy-induced mucositis. In fact, whereasonly 1 of 9 patients receiving placebo achieved complete resolu-tion of their oral lesion, 6 of 9 patients receiving vitamin Eachieved complete resolution. 129 In a randomized study of 16 patients with various cancers, all participants were treated with a regimen containing adri-amycin appropriate for the cancer site. Seven were randomized toreceive 1,800 IU tocopherol daily starting 24 hours before adri-amycin administration and continuing for at least 1 week afteradriamycin administration. Vitamin E did not interfere withchemotherapy but also did not protect against cardiac toxicity. 47 Sixteen evaluable cancer patients in an observational study of 18 patients receiving adriamycin were given dl-alpha-toco-pherol acetate (1,600 IU a day) to determine whether vitamin Ewould protect against alopecia (hair loss), which occurs in virtu-ally all patients receiving adriamycin. Sixty-nine percent ofpatients given adriamycin and vitamin E did not have alopecia.26 ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, jan/feb 2007, VOL. 13, NO. 1 Antioxidants and Other Nutrients With Chemotherapy, Radiation TherapyFurthermore, a correlation was found between the time vitamin E was taken and the degree of alopecia. Most patients who begantaking tocopherol more than 72 hours before chemotherapytreatment did not have alopecia. 130 SUMMARY These studies show that vitamin A, beta-carotene, and vita- min E do not interfere with and actually can enhance the killingcapabilities of therapeutic modalities for cancer, decrease theirside effects, protect normal tissues, and, in some studies, prolongsurvival. Part 2 will review antioxidant combinations, B vita-mins, vitamins D 3and K3, and the glutathione-selenium com- plex. A summary and discussion will then be presented. REFERENCES 1.
