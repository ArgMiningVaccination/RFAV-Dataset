Illegitimate group homes in Arizona were defrauding Native American communities and targeting their vulnerable populations to get AHCCCS payments. It's estimated that thousands of individuals were lured in by the opportunity to participate in \"treatment\" at outpatient clinics for substance abuse or addiction. Instead, they were often isolated and offered drugs and alcohol. If you or someone you love was a victim of this crime, we want you to know that MIND 24-7 is here to help. This traumatic experience may have caused an existing mental health issue to escalate a crisis level or left you or a loved one without access to ongoing care. Whether you're experiencing a mental health crisis, looking for help finding a new mental health care provider or in need of a medication refill, you can walk in to one of MIND 24-7's four locations for assistance anytime day or night.
