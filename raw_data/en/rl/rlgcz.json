It is a unique kind of bathing ritual that dates back to ancient times-- and though many aspects of it have changed, the idea remains the same. A spiritual bath can help you to cleanse your mind and spirit. Not simply for the sake of de-stressing and cleaning your body like a regular bath, spiritual baths require you to be present and mindful, involving specific elements to enhance the bath with psychic power. These elements can include candles, crystals, herbs, oils, salts and more. Spiritual baths can also help to imbue the bather with certain desired benefits, or be used as a manifestation tool to bring about things like abundance and creativity. Spiritual bath rituals are often done during particular phases of the moon such as a full moon or a new moon, since these times of the month are especially spiritually potent. Today we will be discussing how to do a spiritual bath for the new moon, taking place next week on April 22nd, 2020. | | | | 1. PREPARE FOR THE BATH. A new moon is all about transformation, new beginnings and setting visions & intentions for the future. It is a time of rejuvenation. When preparing for this spiritual bath, you will want to lay the groundwork for welcoming renewing energy by making sure that you and your space are physically clean. Clean and declutter your bathroom and tub, then take a quick preliminary shower or bath to cleanse your body. | | | | 2. FILL THE TUB & GATHER MATERIALS. Start filling your tub with water. Some people like to fill the tub with about 3 inches of hot water then add their salts before proceeding to fill up the rest with comfortably warm water. You can also just fill the whole tub with water at whatever temperature is comfortable for you-- then add your salts when it's full. Take this time to get your materials together, since it may take a little while for it to fill. You'll want to grab ingredients that will be mixed directly into your bath, such as herbs, [essential oils](https://www.earthspeaks.com/collections/essential-oils) & [salts](https://www.earthspeaks.com/collections/bath-salts) -- as well as things that will compliment the bath and the atmosphere, such as [candles](https://www.earthspeaks.com/collections/candles) , [crystals](https://www.earthspeaks.com/collections/crystals) and [smudge sticks](https://www.earthspeaks.com/collections/smudge-sticks) or incense. Below we've listed some ideas for what you can use in a new moon spiritual bath: | | | Herbs: Juniper berries, peppermint leaf, eucalyptus leaf, Sea Salt, Himalayan Salt, Epsom Salt, Apple Cider Vinegar and baking soda. | | | | 3. SET UP AMBIANCE & STIR IN INGREDIENTS. Take this time to finish setting up anything that you think will enhance the ambiance of your bath, or that will transport you into a more peaceful and spiritual place. This can include lighting candles, setting up soothing music or nature sounds and opening windows. You can also use this time to give the space where you will be bathing a quick energetic cleanse by lighting [sage](https://www.earthspeaks.com/collections/smudge-sticks) , cedar, incense, [palo santo](https://www.earthspeaks.com/collections/smudge-sticks/products/palo-santo) or other herbs in a process known as \"smudging.\" Bring the smoke around the room and over the tub, then place it in a fire-safe dish or burner off to the side. Now it is time to add the ingredients to your bath. We make a few [great bath salts blends](https://www.earthspeaks.com/collections/bath-salts) that contain different types of salts, essential oils and herbs. Another option is to do it yourself, making a customized recipe for your bath. Choose your favorite elements from the list above in Step 2, or come up with your own, and begin adding them to the bath. As you stir in your ingredients, be mindful and meditative and think about the intentions you have for this new moon. You can also do peaceful energy visualizations, and imagine the tub filling with golden light. | | | | 4. SAY A PRAYER OR MANTRA. Before you get into the tub or as you are stirring in your ingredients, you may want to say a prayer, blessing, mantra or intention aloud. It can be anything you want, as long as it aligns with your general intention for the spiritual bath. | | | | 5. BATHE FOR 20-30 MINUTES. Slowly lower yourself into the bath, allowing each part of your body to adjust to the temperature. Try and keep as much of your body submerged as possible. Cup your hands and gently pour the water over your head. Soak for about 20-30 minutes. While bathing, try to clear your thoughts, relax and meditate. | | | | 7. REST COMFORTABLY AND WIND DOWN. After you get out of the bath, try and allow your body to air dry naturally rather than with a towel. It is important to let your body breathe and continue to take in the energy from the new moon. When you are mostly dry, get comfortable and rest for at least 30 minutes. You may want to lay down, focus on your breathing and just relax. | | | | Throughout this article, there are links to our products that you can purchase online (they are underlined and in blue).
