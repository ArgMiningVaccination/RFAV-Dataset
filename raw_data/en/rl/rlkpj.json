Contact Rosemary Today Remember Your Power to Heal I am always enchanted and amazed at your skill in teaching and perception. You have a unique ability to help a person get to the center of an issue and have the courage to deal with it in a protective and loving atmosphere. This is a rare gift \u2014 plus you are an incredible teacher. -Star Studonivic It's through Grace and Ancient Wisdom that I am here at this time, to teach, heal, and guide as I work with subtle energy to help you AWAKEN, HEAL, and TRANSCEND. I am a SHAMAN and Carrier of Light \u2014 a Shamanic Lightworker. I help people heal at the deepest level to discover their POWER and PASSION and live their lives with health, joy, confidence, and abundance. In my twenties, living and teaching in South Korea, my mother was diagnosed with cancer. All of my training in science did not prepare me for this scenario. I couldn't help my mother HEAL, and the medical system not only failed to produce the desired outcome, but caused great harm in the process. We both felt helpless and powerless. Years later, however, I overcame my dis-ability by learning about natural alternatives and energy to help my dog heal from diabetes and cancer. Ginger was my greatest teacher and AWAKENED my Spiritual connection. She also taught me about the power of natural healing for pets. It's from these experiences that my passion for natural healing has cultivated a strong belief. I have a dream that expensive sick-care systems that support the debilitating dis-eases and traumas of our time will crumble when we share and support each other, one person at a time, through natural healing and self-empowerment to heal. Rosemary worked with me via phone to help with a recent situation. She was very generous with her time and explanation of the process (pendulum plus more) and her willingness to help me work through my issue. I had worked with her in person previously, and know her from a \"past life\" ;o) and can honestly say that she has your best intentions at heart. She is an advocate for personal power and is a trusted friend and is the real deal: a compassionate, caring, honest, intelligent person with many gifts and talents. You can't go wrong consulting with/utilizing all that she has to offer. It will be a thoughtful, amazing, contemplative, enlightening experience! -Karen W. Oh my goodness, Rosemary, I am blown away! I gave her 5ml of the nano before bed last night. Let me tell you, I seriously didn't know if you pushed out healing vibes, was the nano, or both, but what I can tell you is I am a happy dog momma today. She just did #2 and it was solid!!!! I am soooo happy beyond belief. Not only that, but she has always snored and sounded like she had an upper respiratory issue since a pup. On top of that she always moved around while she slept (almost like she couldn't find a comfortable spot). I am just in utter disbelief right now that the nano silver firmed up her stool (just wasn't giving enough), but she didn't sound like she had phlegm/mucus in her nose/throat when breathing last night AND she minimally moved around during her sleep last night. My goodness, I wish I would have reached out sooner instead of being afraid of overdosing her and remotely comparing the nano to side effects of colloidal silver. I'm going to keep her on the 5ml 3 times a day (increase if needed) for a week and see what happens afterwards (unless you suggest otherwise). Thank you soooo much for your time and love of helping people!!! You gave me peace of mind and I can't say enough for how much the zeolite made her coat beautiful and doesn't have much of a dog smell anymore either. Looks like I'll be ordering more nano and zeolite soon to always have as my medical arsenal. - Jody B. Rosemary is truly a blessing in my life! Her loving-kindness, compassion, intuition and knowledge have assisted me throughout my spiritual journey. Rosemary is a master in Shamanic healing, Sound healing, and Reiki healing. Additionally, she possesses the qualities necessary for teaching. She is experienced and eager to share her psychic communications and channeling of spirit. I really enjoyed the Reiki & Sound healing classes, as well as a few other fascinating classes, such as Intuitive Crystal Magic and Animal healing. During the energy shifts and challenging time, Rosemary continues to offer her classes online and to help others (even animals) through distant healing sessions. I am excited to continue my spiritual journey alongside or with Rosemary! Also, I'm so grateful for the distant healing Rosemary offered to both my daughter and me. My experience was incredible and I had an emotional release after about 10-15 min into the session...very similar to my previous in person release. WOW! Thank you! I highly recommend Rosemary. - Diane Rogers Enter a world of magic, transformation, and the Fifth Dimension.

She matched the pace of the class to our needs. The second day really pulled it all together. At the end of the program I felt very confident. Thank you, Rosemary. -Deborah Kirkendall Had we not found Rosemary and Ginger's story, we would have had very little hope, and we are forever grateful for her being there. Our decision to do chemo goes against Rosemary's convictions, but that has not changed anything in her support and willingness to help answer any questions, we might have! It is like having a close friend by your side. Thank you, Rosemary, for being there!!!! Warm thoughts from Susan in Georgia\" Rosemary has an amazing calm energy. My experience with Reiki 1&2 (Integrative Class) was amazing and a life changing experience, not just to expand/create my own practice, but to expand my spiritual side as a person. I learned about crystals, cards, oils, forks that I never knew before. A life changing experience. Thank you! - Annie Currier Talk About a Celebration! After the first day I was easily able to balance my chakras. After day 2 I feel simultaneous peace, calmness, and excitement. I am able to \"hear\" messages better and more clear than ever. My fuzzy hands finally have a direction and I am definitely on the right path. Thank you so much Rosemary! - R.J.
