Here are 16 herbs, like basil, mint, and sage, you can grow indoors.", "sitename": "The Spruce", "date": "2022-03-10", "cleaned_text": "Being able to grow [herbs](https://www.thespruce.com/herbs-corresponding-to-horoscope-1762360) indoors, as well as in the [garden outdoors](https://www.thespruce.com/growing-herbs-in-pots-getting-started-3876523), is a huge plus for a number of reasons. In the northern United States, where growing herbs outdoors is largely out of the question for almost half of the year, it means you can still grow your own herbs (rather than having to pay money for them at the supermarket) all year long. Most herbs are aromatic, and having them indoors means being able to enjoy their fragrances whenever you want. And their presence indoors also means easier access when you wish to cook with them. While it is true that most herbs are easier to grow outdoors than indoors, the main things you need for success in growing many herbs indoors are simply a sunny window, a pest-free plant (inspect seedlings carefully before buying), a selection of the best herbs that grow indoors, and a little knowledge about each plant's needs. To get started, find the right spot for your indoor herbs. A rule of thumb is that herbs native to a region warmer than yours (and many herbs do come from the Mediterranean) need a south-facing window in the winter, while herbs that like it a little cooler can survive in a west-facing window in winter. Some herbs aren't fussy at all; they can be placed in either type of window in winter. Even those that like south-facing windows in winter need to be moved to cooler spots in summer. Warning Place these herbs out of reach of pets as they contain compounds that can be toxic to cats and dogs: chives, bay laurel, lemon grass, parsley, and marjoram. Here are 16 herbs you can grow indoors all year long. - 01 of 16 [Basil (Ocimum basilicum)](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-grow-basil-plants-1402624) Whether it is to make pesto or a tomato-based sauce, many gardeners who love cooking Italian food find [sweet basil](https://www.thespruceeats.com/what-is-basil-1807985)a must to grow. As a bonus, this annual can have ornamental features, too. Some types sport a deep purple foliage color and/or leaves that are ruffly. As soon as your basil reaches 6 inches tall, start pinching it often to keep it from blooming and [fulfilling its life mission](https://www.thespruce.com/why-do-plants-bolt-2539753). Grow basil in a large, deep pot. A large pot is especially important if you will be growing multiple basil plants in the pot: Basil is susceptible to fungal diseases, which can be controlled by providing good air circulation through sufficient spacing (12 inches). For the same reason, avoid overhead watering. A deep pot will allow you to strike the required balance between good drainage and moisture retention. - Mature height: 18-24 inches tall and wide - Sun exposure: south-facing window in winter - Soil needs: Basil needs good drainage, but not so sharp that water drains through immediately; it likes evenly moist soil. Use high-quality potting soil. Feed it with an all-purpose fertilizer. - 02 of 16 [Catnip (Nepeta cataria)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-catnip-indoors-1902570#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DCatnip%2520is%2520not%2520an%2520especially%2Cin%2520well%252Ddrained%2520potting%2520soil.%26text%3DCatnip%2520grown%2520indoors%2520will%2520not%2Cwide%2520by%25208%2520inches%2520deep.) When selecting plants to include in an herb garden in the home, do not forget the needs of the family cat. [Catnip](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-grow-catnip-plants-2132328), a perennial which grows like a weed outdoors, is also easy to grow indoors (much easier than basil, for example). Once catnip puts on some height, pinch it early and often to prevent flowering, and give the pinchings to your grateful feline friend. - Mature height: 2-3 feet tall and wide - Sun exposure: west-facing or south-facing window in winter - Soil needs: good drainage; minimal fertilization needed; low to average water needs - 03 of 16 [Chives (Allium schoenoprasum)](https://www.thespruce.com/chives-plant-care-growing-guide-5078626) The chive plant, another easy-to-grow perennial, has a light onion flavor. Indeed, It is related to the common onion. Its grass-like leaves are popular in soups and salads. It also has one of the more attractive flowers among the culinary herbs. Chives will multiply over time. When your chives form a good-sized mass, consider dividing them. If you dig underneath them, you'll find bulblets and a dense mass of roots. You can easily break off a clump (consisting of three or four plants) and transplant it to another pot. - Mature height: 10-15 inches tall and wide - Sun exposure: can survive in a west-facing window in winter - Soil needs: good drainage; feed with an all-purpose fertilizer; average water needs - 04 of 16 [Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-lemon-balm-indoors-1902572) Added to soups or salads, lemon balm gives them a citrusy flavor. Or use it in potpourri to scent your home naturally. Susceptible to fungal diseases, care for this perennial as you would for basil. Continue to 5 of 16 below. - Mature height: 1-2 feet tall, 1-3 feet wide - Sun exposure: south-facing window in winter - Soil needs: good drainage; minimal fertilization needed; average water needs - of 16 [Oregano (Origanum vulgare hirtum)](https://www.thespruce.com/herb-profile-oregano-1761786) A classic seasoning for Italian dishes, sandwiches, and pizza, this drought-resistant perennial is easy to grow indoors, but err on the side of giving it more, rather than less sunlight than you think it may need in winter. Not as fussy about humidity as rosemary, oregano can still profit from having a little extra humidity. An easy answer is to place its pot on a tray filled with [moistened pebbles](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-make-a-pebble-tray-7371481). - Mature height: 2 feet tall, 18 inches wide - Sun exposure: south-facing window in winter - Soil needs: good drainage; use an all-purpose fertilizer; low to average 06 of 16 [Parsley (Petroselinum crispum neopolitanum)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-parsley-1402629) Parsley, a biennial, falls into two categories. The curly type, P. crispum, has more ornamental value. But the flat-leaf type, P. crispum neopolitanum, has more culinary value, lending a stronger flavor to your Italian dishes. - Mature height: 9-12 inches tall and wide - Sun exposure: can survive in a west-facing window in winter - Soil needs: Parsley needs good drainage, but not so sharp that water drains through immediately; it likes evenly moist soil. Use a high-quality potting soil. Minimal fertilization required. - 07 of 16 [Rosemary (Salvia rosmarinus)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-and-care-for-rosemary-plants-1403406) This drought-tolerant perennial becomes relatively large and woody over time, so give it a big pot. Its harvested leaves are commonly used in dips and drinks. Like basil, rosemary is just a bit fussier to grow indoors than most of the other selections here. This is mainly because it likes high humidity, a condition that many northern homes lack in winter. To address this challenge, build a tent around your rosemary to trap moisture. Simply install (at a height greater than that of the plant) stakes in the pot, and drape clear plastic over the stakes. Lift up the plastic to gain access when watering, then replace the plastic. As the water evaporates, the tent will trap it and increase humidity. - Mature height: 2-6 feet tall, 2-4 feet wide - Sun exposure: south-facing window in winter - Soil needs: sharp drainage; minimal need for fertilizer; low to average water needs - 08 of 16 [Sage (Salvia officinalis)](https://www.thespruce.com/growing-sage-1402599) Known for its use in poultry stuffing, in particular, this perennial is related to the Salvia flowers with which you are familiar from shopping at garden centers, such as [Salvia sylvestris 'May Night.'](https://www.thespruce.com/may-night-salvia-flowers-2132557)There is also an [ornamental sage](https://www.thespruce.com/tricolor-sage-plants-2132331)(Salvia officinalis 'Tricolor') that sports three colors on its foliage. Sage has only moderate moisture needs, so be sure not to overwater it. Continue to 9 of 16 below. - Mature height: 2-2.5 feet tall, 2-3 feet wide - Sun exposure: south-facing window in winter - Soil needs: sharp drainage; minimal need to fertilize - 09 of 16 [Spearmint (Mentha spicata)](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-grow-spearmint-5086858) Herbs in [the mint](https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-mint-5120608)family are especially easy to grow, even indoors. Known for its use in flavoring drinks, teas, and jelly, this perennial likes its soil to be kept evenly moist. An extra benefit of growing this herb indoors, rather than outdoors in the garden, is that it is invasive. Being contained in a pot on your windowsill, it has nowhere to go. - Mature height: 18-36 inches tall, with a narrower spread - Sun exposure: west-facing window in winter - Soil needs: good drainage; minimal fertilization needed - 10 of 16 [Thyme (Thymus vulgaris)](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-thyme-indoors-1902495) Thyme is great for flavoring a variety of types of meat. In addition to the kinds of thyme used mainly for culinary purposes, there are also versions of this perennial used in [landscaping as a ground cover](https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-creeping-thyme-2132329). Under the right conditions, red mother of thyme (Thymus serpyllum 'Coccineum'), so-named for its flower color, can be quite showy. Thyme is the opposite of rosemary in one respect: It likes low humidity. So save the windowsill in the kitchen (a room that tends to be more humid than most) for your rosemary and find a sunny windowsill in a drier room for your thyme. Thyme is drought-tolerant and can actually be harmed if it gets too much water. - Mature height: 6-12 inches tall and wide - Sun exposure: south-facing window in winter - Soil needs: sharp drainage; minimal fertilization needs - 11 of 16 [Bay Laurel](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-grow-your-own-bay-laurel-tree-1402602) Bay laurel also known as bay leaf is used to season soups, stews, sauces, and stocks to release its flavor and then removed before serving. Dried bay leaves have a floral and herbal flavor while fresh leaves have stronger, eucalyptus-like notes. In landscapes, bay laurel can be grown as shrubs or large trees in warm climates, and in cooler climates, it can be grown in containers and brought indoors during the winter months. Place it near a sunny window or door and keep it away from cold and hot drafty air. - Mature height: 4-8 feet tall - Sun exposure: south-facing window in winter - Soil needs: good drainage, general-purpose potting mix; minimal fertilization needs - 12 of 16 [Lemongrass](https://www.thespruce.com/lemongrass-plant-profile-4686088) The stalks of lemongrass are used in soups, curries, sauces, marinades, teas, and cocktails for its zingy, lemony-ginger flavor. Native to Sri Lanka and India, lemongrass is a fragrant, ornamental grass that can grow up to 4 feet tall and 3 feet wide. Hardy to zones 10-11, it can also be grown as an annual in cooler climates. Place it in a bright, sunny location indoors and keep it watered regularly. Continue to 13 of 16 below. - Mature height: 2-4 feet tall, 2-3 feet wide - Sun exposure: south-facing window in winter - Soil needs: good drainage, keep evenly moist; use high quality potting soil - 13 of 16 [Marjoram](https://www.thespruce.com/how-to-grow-sweet-marjoram-1761795) Marjoram is related to oregano, but has a more sweet and floral flavor, and is used in soups, stews, and meat dishes. To grow indoors, it should be planted in well-draining soil in a pot at least 6 inches wide and 6 to 8 inches deep with a drainage hole. Marjoram doesn't need a lot of humidity, but it will need a lot of light and consistent temperatures. - Mature height: 1-2 feet tall and wide - Sun exposure: south-facing window in winter - Soil needs: good drainage; keep evenly moist; minimal fertilization needed - 14 of 16 [Cilantro](https://www.thespruce.com/grow-cilantro-inside-1902485) Cilantro is a tasty herb that brightens up dishes with a fresh, citrusy flavor. Used in recipes across the globe, from chimichurri to zhoug, it's a highlight in salsas, sauces, pestos, and dips. Cilantro is a fast-growing herb that will last a few months indoors, due to its tendency to bolt; once it flowers, it turns bitter. Cilantro's life can be extended by pinching it back regularly. Plant cilantro in a plastic pot, about 18-inch wide and 12-inch deep, which helps retain moisture and humidity, and place it in a spot that's very bright or provides morning sun. - Mature height: 1-2 feet tall, 1-1.5 feet wide - Sun exposure: morning sun in an east-facing window or a window with very bright light - Soil needs: good drainage, evenly moist, acidic - 15 of 16 [Dill](https://www.thespruce.com/dill-tips-for-growing-and-using-1402606) Not only is dill a signature ingredient in pickled foods, it's bright and grassy with a celery and fennel like flavor that adds punch to salads, soups, sauces, and creamy dips and dressings. Choose a dwarf variety like 'Fernleaf', which is ideal for containers, and keep it near a sunny window with evenly moist soil. Like cilantro, dill is a fast growing plant. When it flowers and goes to seed, it will stop producing leaves. Harvest the seeds, also used to season dishes and pickling spice mixes, once they start to turn brown. - Mature height: 3-5 feet tall, 2-3 feet wide - Sun exposure: south-facing window in winter - Soil needs: good drainage; rich, loose, - 16 of 16 Chervil Chervil is a delicate herb related to parsley that's used in egg, fish, and poultry dishes, soups and salads. Common in French cooking it's often referred to as French parsley and has a light anise flavor. Keep chervil by a sunny window and keep the soil evenly moist. Pinch back and deadhead this plant often to promote growth and prevent bolting. - Mature height: 2 feet tall - Sun exposure: south-facing window in winter - Soil needs: good drainage; keep evenly moist; minimal fertilization needed Learn More Whether you grow your herbs indoors or outdoors, planting them in pots is a great way to get started.
