FIELD* I. INTRODUCTION The private pharmaceutical industry is perennially one of the most profitable in the United States.1 Its success is built on a cascade of products, some of which generate billions of dollars in sales each year.2 New ones continually enter the market to replenish the supply. Companies that ultimately market ne w drugs are visible to all. Their partners in research and clinical te sting are known in the industry and throughout the investment community. Wh at is not as readily apparent is the partner that creates the foundation for the entire drug development process. That is the government.3 New drugs emerge from many different sources. Some come from research that applies basic biological knowledge.4 Some emerge from trial * Professor of Law, Earle Mack School of La w and professor of health management and policy, School of Public Health, Drexel University.

Even the most ardent admirers of private industry innovation concede the import ance of the government in promoting the underlying science on which it rests.11 Debates may rage over the relative amount of credit that each si de deserves, but not over the necessity of both sectors to the advancement of pharmaceutical science. Most of the drugs in wide use today resulted from such public-private collaborations. Of the 21 drugs with the highest therapeutic impact, 14 stemmed directly from an enabling discovery that the government had supported.12 Often, public and private resear ch continues to interact even after a new drug therapy has reached the market.13 Such continuing interchanges have produced major breakthroughs, for example better understanding of the mechanism of ac tion of Azidothymidine (AZT) as a treatment for HIV infection.14 However, the public-private partnership does not end with a handoff from government-backed basic scientists to applied investigators in corporate settings. The public sector contributes to drug development throughout the lifecycle of new drugs in many ways. 15 Perhaps most significantly, it creates vast mark ets for drugs through public health 5.

Medicare, which insures the elderly, spends over $55 billion a year on outpatient prescriptions, and over $10 billion on drugs administered by physicians.16 Medicaid, which insures the poor, spends over $26 billion a year.17 The government also purc hases drugs for veterans through the Veterans Health Service and through the Department of Defense for military personnel and their dependents.18 The government also shapes the ph armaceutical industry through regulation. The primary agency involved is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which serves as a gatekeeper to determine which drugs may reach the market.19 To pass through the gate, new products must undergo years of clinical testing th at assess safety and effectiveness.20 After approval, the FDA continues to monito r drugs for safety and to impose restrictions on marketing and promotion.21 The FDA-imposed testing process accounts for the lion's share of the cost of drug development and sets parameters for the kinds of d rugs that ultimately reach patients.22 While manufacturers may complain about bureau cratic inefficiency and delays on the agency's part, this vetting process is largely responsible for the public's confidence in their products.23 Beyond the FDA, patent laws, administe red by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), circ umscribe the commercialization and marketing process.24 Patent rules determine the nature and length of the 16.

The Financial Engine: Research and Development Several factors account for the phar maceutical industry's consistent good fortune.35 For one, demand for health-enhancing and life-saving products will never diminish, so the industry's output will always be needed. 36 For another, most consumers to day have assistance from third parties in paying for pharmaceutical products through some form of insurance, either public or private.37 The pharmaceutical industry is also able to charge high prices for many of its products because they are insu lated from market competition through patents.38 While patents do not last indefinitely, they, along with various other legal protections, offer most pres cription drugs at least 10 years of market exclusivity after they first reach consumers and often more.39 The exclusive sale of life-saving products is certainly a recipe for financial success, but only if one more ingredient is present. As patents expire, competitive pricing by manufact urers of generic copies drives down profit margins, so a steady supply of new drugs is needed.40 The industry must devote a tremendous amount of its attention and resources to that end. To maintain profitability, a steady suppl y of fresh products must continually flow through each company's \"pipeline.\"41 33. Biopharma Forecasts & Trends , IMS INST.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 16 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOUR NAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 6:11 The never-ending search for new products has shaped the pharmaceutical industry into the most research-intensive in the United States.42 It devotes more private resources to scientific investigation than any other.43 In 2002, this investment equaled 18% of sales, which is roughly five times the average for American manufacturing firms.44 Since 1985, this percentage has been higher even th an that devoted by the computer industry.45 The exact magnitude of pharmaceut ical research and development spending is subject to some dispute. The industry's trade association, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufa cturers of America (PhRMA) uses a broad definition that includes spending on post-market monitoring of drugs after their final approval by the FDA.46 By this measure, research spending grew from $6 billion to $39 billion between 1980 and 2004 in constant 2005 dollars, reflecting an average rate of increase of about 8%.47 PhRMA puts the 2009 figure at $65.3 billion.48 The National Science Foundation (NSF) calculated the value of industry research at the premarket phases only and found an increase from $5.5 billion to $17 billion over the same period, for an average rate of growth of 5%.49 Nevertheless, under either analysis, the industry has steadily an d dramatically expanded its commitment to research over a considerable period of time. Of course, not all of this research ac tivity actually creates new drugs that are truly innovative. About two-thirds of the new drug applications (NDAs) submitted to the FDA each year do not involve a new molecular entity (NME).50 Instead, they represent reformulations or minor modifications of existing drugs or requests for approval of new uses.51 Drugs involving reformulations or incremental modi fications of existing modifications are commonly known as \"me-too\" drugs, as they follow an established therapeutic approach.52 In most years, the FD A approves only about 20 drugs that are based on new NMEs.53 42.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2012] THE PRIVATE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY 17 However, regardless of the originalit y of the drugs being introduced, the steady flow of new products is a ha llmark of the pharmaceutical industry. One can debate how much clinical valu e is actually contributed when new drugs mimic existing ones, but it is un deniable that the industry as we know it today thrives on a massive research and development apparatus. It is in this regard that the government prov ides it with the biggest boost. III. THE CORNERSTONE OF PUBLIC BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH : NIH How does the industry find the ne w drugs it needs to refresh its inventory? For two-thirds of its products , the answer is easy as they are me- too drugs based on established products.54 For the one-third of new drugs that represents true innovation, the answer is more complex. These are medications that are truly new and that emerge from advances in scientific knowledge.55 This is where the implicit partnership with the government is most essential. A. A Mission to Underwrite Biomedical Science The government's foundational role in promoting biomedical research is administered primarily by the National Institutes of Heal th (NIH). This massive agency, which is a component of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, spends about $30 billion a year to enhance the fundamental understanding of biology and medicine.56 That amount has more than doubled since the mid-1990s.57 Most of it is devoted to basic science that seeks to decipher underlying physiological mechanisms \u2014 the raw fuel that private companies refine into finished commercial products.58 The division of research roles betw een industry and government is not a simple split between applied and basic science. NIH performs some applied clinical studies of new drugs, and private industry conducts some basic research.59 The relationship between the priv ate and public spheres is further blurred by a range of other govern ment programs that promote the 54.

One analysis estimated that every 1% increase in public research funding pr oduces an increase of between 2 and 2.4% in the number of commerci ally available new compounds.62 Another projected the rate of return from pub lic funding of biomedical research at up to 30% a year.63 Without question, government-funded science is an essential ingredient underlying the industry's business model. B. NIH's Growth from Humble Origins The huge scientific enterprise that NIH represents today began as a modest endeavor in the late nineteenth century in Staten Island, New York.64 Dr. Joseph J. Kinyoun set up a laborato ry in a marine hospital there in 1887 to study bacteria that cause common infectious diseases.65 He succeeded in identifying the organism that causes cholera, the cholera bacillus, which aided physicians in diagnosing suspicious cases of this deadly disease.66 Successes such as this led the governme nt to move his laboratory in 1891 to Washington, D.C. and to give it a new name, the Hygienic Laboratory.67 Ten years later, Congress authoriz ed $35,000 for a new building to house it.68 The Hygienic Laboratory gained new responsibilities and prominence in 1902, when Congress created a Divisi on of Pathology and Bacteriology within the federal Marine Hospital Service to house its research.69 At that time, the laboratory also added Ph.D.-tr ained researchers to the physicians in its workforce.70 Among its new responsibilities was setting standards and 60.

Ransdell of Louisiana, who in 1930 successfully sponsored legislation to fund fellowships for basic research within the Hygienic Laboratory.82 The Ransdell Act also changed the name of the laboratory to the National Institute of Health.83 Initial funding was modest, but it marked the start of a new approach to the sponsorship of research under government auspices.84 Funding grew significantly over the years along with 71.

Expansion into a Research Powerhouse NIH is organized today into 27 comp onent institutes that focus on specific categories of diseases or types of therapy.86 Each employs scientists in-house to work in government labo ratories but spends most of its resources funding researchers outside of the government in universities and research institutes.87 The model for this structure originated in 1937 with the establishment of the Nation al Cancer Institute (NCI).88 Originally organized as an independent agency, it was fo rmally incorporated into NIH in 1944.89 The intramural research component of NIH's mission gained a major boost in 1940, when the agency opened its sprawling campus in Bethesda, Maryland.90 The land was donated by Mr. and Mrs. Luke Wilson, and today it houses one of the largest collections of scientific research buildings in the world.91 In 1953, a large hospital, the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical Center, was added to the site.92 When he dedicated the complex, President Franklin Roosevelt emphasized the signific ance of the enterprise to national security on the eve of America's entry into World War II. He observed: \"We must recruit not only men and materials but also knowledge and science in the service of national strength an d that is what we are doing here.\"93 If anyone doubted the value of biomed ical science to military strength at the time, World War II would have removed any uncertainty. As one observed noted, the war effort \"h ad mobilized a concerted government effort \u2014 unprecedented to date \u2014 in applying research to practical use.\"94 America's success in the War owed a huge debt to a long list of medical 85.

As the War ended, NIH received significant new authority to maintain its research role.96 Initially, it received responsibility for phasing out wartime research contracts with univer sities, but Congress soon changed course and decided that many of th ese arrangements should remain in place.97 The agency continued to administer them, and it received additional funding and staff to pursue this mission.98 The Public Health Service Act of 1944, which had merged NCI into NIH, provided for the creation of additional component institut es, and it set in motion a series of dramatic budget increases that have continued ever since.99 An NIH budget of $4 million in 1947 grew to $100 million in 1957, to $1 billion in 1974, to more than $27 billion in 2004, and to $30 million in 2009.100 D. NIH as the Backbone of Biomedical Science From the perspective of public policy, the most significant aspect of the steady NIH budget increases is the po rtion that is directed to private researchers. About 80% of the ag ency's budget supports studies at universities, research institut es, and similar organizations.101 Scientists in these settings propose the actual structure of the studies they wish to conduct and the research questions they will pursue.102 The agency then constitutes committees of experts from outside of government to determine which of these proposals merit funding.103 This arrangement shapes the huge research enterprise that the agency supports as a public-private partnership on a massive scale. In the words of one observer: \"Never in the nation's history had public funds in such amounts been placed at the disposal of individuals working in suppo rt of their own objectives outside the framework of federal institutions.\" 104 Over the years since World War II, th e nation has looked to NIH time and time again as the first line of attack to address pressing health needs.

In 1992, the agency added the National Center for Complimentary and Alte rnative Medicine, and in 1993, the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities.108 With all of these changes in funding priorities and focus, the goal of Congress and the desire of much of the public has been to keep the government in the lead in moving American medicine forward. 109 The influence of NIH on biomedical science in America extends well beyond its support for individual studies to a role in shaping a key foundation of the research enterprise. That is building and maintaining the pipeline of new scientists. The agency fu nds the education of most doctoral students in biomedical sciences alon g with additional postdoctoral training that many of them receive. 110 Before NIH provided this support, Ph.D.s in biomedical science were relatively rare.111 Today, those holding these degrees form the workforce that conduc ts most research that leads to new pharmaceutical products. In the words of one observer: \". . . there is no question that the American pharmace utical and biotechnology industries (which lead the world) could not exist, let alone thrive, without those thousands of trained people.\" 112 E.

Among recent successes under these laws are the development of Thyrogen, a form of thyroid stimulating ho rmone commercialized by Genzyme, Prezista, a treatment for HIV infect ion commercialized by Tibotec, and Gardasil, a vaccine against the human papilloma virus which can cause cervical cancer that is sold by Merck.114 Congress facilitated the process of forming explicit government-industry collaborations with several legislative en actments. It first focused on this area in 1980.115 A major impetus was the ruling by the Supreme Court that year that permitted the award of patents for artificially engineered life forms in the case of Diamond v. Chakrabarty.116 That decision formed the legal foundation for the rise of the biotechnolo gy industry by offering investors a route to profit from new discoveries.117 Biotechnology companies seek to co mmercialize the fruits of academic, government and industry research, however the task of coordinating the contributions of each of th ese sectors can be daunting. 118 They function in separate worlds with vastly different modes of operation. As the nascent industry began to take shape, barriers between them threatened to disrupt potential synergies that co uld help it to take off. 119 Congress used several strategies to encourage the growth of the biotechnology industry and the commercia lization of biomedical discoveries. 113.

A collection of laws impl ement strong incentives for companies and universities to collaborate with the government to bring scientific advances to market. Of these, the Patent and Trademark Law Amendment Act of 1980, commonly known as the Bayh-Dole Act, is the most important.122 It gives institutions that receiv e NIH research grants the right to patent inventions that flow from the fruits of their investigations.123 The goal is to give universities an incentiv e to attempt to commercialize research conducted under their auspices.124 Despite this incentive, private firms are often reluctant to invest in the initial basic research that is needed before actual product development can begin.125 To address this gap, Congress developed a mechanism to formalize arrangements between govern ment agencies and private entities to work jointly on the commercializatio n of breakthrough technologies. This is accomplished through a type of understanding known as a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA). 126 These are partnerships that allow for joint development with a negotiated set of contributions, responsibilities, and remuneration involving each party.127 CRADAs are based on a series of laws that Congress enacted during the 1980s to encourage the transfer of technology from government laboratories to private firm s that can commercialize it.128 The primary law is the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innova tion Act of 1980, which established 120.

Two of its efforts in this regard are pa rticularly important in nurturing the private market as it helps to transform medical science. 1. The Human Genome Project The first of NIH's efforts to move medicine toward new horizons is the immense initiative to map the entire set of human genes known as the Human Genome Project (HGP).139 The molecular structure of the genetic makeup of all living creatures was discovered in 1953 when James Watson and Francis Crick delineated the composition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the chemical building block of genes.140 It was a path-breaking discovery that earned the two scientists Nobel Prizes.141 a. The quest to map the human genome Applications of this knowledge were relatively slow to advance for the first decades after its discovery.142 That began to change in the 1970s, when techniques were developed to manipulate the genetic structure of microorganisms.143 With them, the era of custom-designed life forms had begun.144 The door to commercialization of these creations was opened in 1980 with the Supreme Court's ruling in Diamond v. Chakrabarty that artificially created life forms could be patented.145 With legal protection for its inventions assured, the biotechnology industry was born. Designer microorganisms found an a rray of uses, but the real promise of genetic science lay in its applicatio ns to human health.

Mapping the entire human genome required a massive effort.152 However, while the possibilities for improving health were enormous, the specific applications to which it might lead were speculative.153 This was a prime example of basic research with an indeterminate payoff.

National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences While there have been many success stories, the bridge between basic research and commercial applications ca n sometimes be difficult to cross. With drugs taking up to a decade and by some estimates more than a billion dollars on average to bring from concept to market and a failure rate of over 95%, pharmaceutical compan ies often hesitate to commit the needed resources when the end result is uncertain.193 This reluctance is most often displayed when a drug represents a novel approach to treatment that does not yet have a track record, a ca tegory that includes most genomic drugs.194 As a result, companies have been slower to delve into genetic drug development than many medica l experts had initially hoped.195 The pipelines of conventional d rugs wending their way through the testing and development process began to shrink in the 1990s, and, consequently, the rate of FDA approvals for new drugs based on novel therapeutic approaches also began to decline. 196 Rather than taking the chance of achieving breakthroughs in genomics, many companies took the opposite course of reducing investments in research.197 At the same time, venture capital firms started to hesita te in providing investment capital to small biotechnology companies fo r risky forays into genetics.198 Progress toward realizing the full promise of ge netic medicine slowed dramatically as the industry grappled with the confines of its traditional economic model.199 For NIH, the hesitation of private in dustry to commercialize the fruits of government-funded basic research represented a threat to its underlying mission. 200 Historically, the agency has been able to rely on the profit potential of new drugs to motivate indu stry to move drugs from concepts to 193.

In the reluctance of private com panies to commercialize genomics and personalized medicine, the agency sa w the need to move proactively.202 If industry were not in a position to crea te its future on its own, the government would have to do it. For several year s, NIH considered ways in which it could take the lead in turning genetic discoveries into marketable products. In its view, the gap between basic and clinical research required a new form of investigation that wo uld translate scientific findings into potential applications. This scientific endeavor has come to be called \"translational research.\"203 The job of stimulating this new kind of scientific inquiry called for novel approaches. Starting in the early 2000s, NIH began identifying and implementing several of them with the goal of attacking the problem from different angles.204 The focus of its efforts was on enticing researchers into the new field and providing them with appropriate training.205 To that end, NIH funded the \"Pioneer Award\" to support creative problem solving.206 It also devoted funding to facilities and to training of investigators.207 It promoted the creation of new resources, like clinical trial networks, biospecimen repositories, and molecular screening libraries.208 It also considered ways of restructuring it self to better accommodate its emerging translational role.209 The first step in this process was to launch a new funding program known as \"Clinical and Translational Science Awards\" to promote the development of academic centers to support translational work.210 201.

The National Center for Advancing Tr anslational Sciences (NCATS) was conceived that year and implemented in 2011.212 Its mission is to identify and remedy \"bottlenecks\" that stand betw een scientific discovery and clinical applications.213 In Dr. Collins' view, these arise in large part from the novelty of the paradigm for genetic drug development.214 Genomics, he believes, has revealed \". . . that the entire framework of medical taxonomy requires rethinking and that therapeutics of the future likely will be designed with cellular networks in mind, rather than being limited by historical designations of disease category.\" 215 The biggest bottlenecks lie between the discovery of genes that can cause diseases and the initiation of research to test ways to control them.216 Without an established drug develo pment road to follow, companies are reluctant to forge ahead on new ones.217 In a market-based economy, each company looks to its own interests. Fo r many pharmaceutical firms that are peering ahead at a dramatically alte red economic landscape, that means limiting exposure to financial risk. The safest course is stand aside and let others test the waters.218 This leaves the government as the only entity with the mission of protecting larger nation al interests and the resources to do so.219 NCATS focuses its efforts on the init ial steps in the drug development process.220 That is the time when drug testing begins, and the process is least attractive for private investors, because the chances of success are 211.

If it succeeds through this phase, the chance that it will eventually reach the market is greatly enhanced. At that point, the Center will acti vely seek a private partner.224 The new center will not try to actually bring new drugs to market. NIH is not interested in moving into the commercial sphere.225 The goal is instead to create the conditions that enable the competitive market to work in bringing genomic therapies to patients as it has in producing traditional drugs.226 As the pillar that has supported private pharmaceutical innovation for the better part of the past century, NIH stands eager to extend that mission into this new terrain. It seems the more scientists learn about the way genes function, the more they find they have to learn to apply discoveries to the needs of patients. That requires a robust private sector to commercialize new products. 227 However, the investment in basic knowledge that is required is still too great to entice most pharmaceutical firms to make the leap.228 The scientific infrastructure does not yet exist to translate the new paradigm of biomedic al research into a market-based business.229 Industry needs the government to cr eate it, and, as it has in so many other ways, NIH has taken up the challenge.

During the 1990s, when the rate of coverage almost doubled, overall prescription expenditures also experienced their highest level of grow th, almost tripling from $40.3 billion to $120.6 billion.248 The trend continued during the early 2000s, when Medicare prescription spending rose from $2 billion in 2000 to over $39 239.

Quality Assurance Through the FDA It is difficult to sell a product if the public has no confidence in it. This is all the more true if the product can cause serious injury or death. That is the position the pharmaceutical industry is in when it sells medicines that can achieve miraculous benefits in some cases but that under some circumstances can produce serious harm. Americans, by and large, trust the safety of the drugs their doctors prescribe. 256 There have certainly been instances in which hazardous products have reached the market, but mo st of the time, a vast apparatus of quality oversight keeps that from happening.257 The public reassurance that this engenders is crucial to sustaining the industry. If patients worried about experiencing severe harm every time they filled a prescription, many would balk at filling them and many doctors at writing them. 1.

FDA approval was sought for a new drug known as thalidomide that was thought to be he lpful when taken by pregnant women in preventing miscarriages and that also worked as a sleeping pill. 285 It had already been approved and was widely prescribed in Europe.286 However, as use of it spread, so did reports of severe birth defects in the children of women who had taken it. By 1962, ther e had been more than 5,000 such reports worldwide.287 In response, the FDA slowed its review process to allow more time for info rmation to accumulate.288 The link between thalidomide and birth defects eventually became clear and was widely reported in the press.289 Before the agency had made a final determination, the application for approval was withdrawn.290 Had the 1938 law not been in effect at the time, the FDA would have lacked authority to keep thalidomide o ff the market while it considered the news from Europe of devastating adver se effects. There is no way to know how many tragic birth defects would ha ve occurred in the United States before the agency could have gathered enough evidence to pull it from the market, but it is likely that the nu mber would have been considerable. 291 In response to this near miss, Congress strengthened the FDA's authority yet again in 1962, this time to require that manufacturers es tablish a drug's efficacy in addition to its safety befo re the FDA can permit patients to receive it.292 Additional refinements and enhancemen ts of the FDA's authority have been enacted over the years.293 However, prior review of safety and efficacy 282.

The FDA Today The FDA regulatory apparatus as it exi sts today is far from perfect. A number of drugs have been pulled from the market or subjected to heightened warnings years after approval when new safety hazards came to light. 296 However, incidents of drugs entering the market with unknown and devastating side effects are rare.297 Countless drug candidates have been blocked before reaching the public because of safety concerns that arise during the years of premarket clinical testing. 298 At the least, the public knows that a tremendous amount of atte ntion has been directed toward the safety of the drugs that are prescribed.299 Application of consistent regulatory standards also adds stability to the market by reassuring private companies and investors that products will be judged through an established scientific process.300 The FDA today is one of the most trusted agencies of the federal government. In a 2004 poll, 70% of the respondents reported having either a great deal or at least a moderate amount of confidence in it.301 The industry often complains about bureaucr atic delays and inefficiency in the drug approval process, but if patient s believed that no one was watching over their medications, their willingness to buy the industry's products would be severely compromised.302 The private pharmaceutical market rests on such a stamp of approval that only an outside impartial force like the government can provide. 294.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2012] THE PRIVATE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY 43 C. Direct Government Market Support The government through the FDA also acts affirmatively to shape the private market for pharmaceuticals by developing and sustaining key sectors that might not otherwise exist. These effo rts guide the market in directions it would not have taken on its own. A fe w of them are particularly influential. 1. Facilitating Generics to Create Market Competition Most importantly, the governmen t has fashioned the competitive dynamics of the overall pharmaceutical market by facilitating the entry of generic drugs. These are products that include the same active ingredient as an existing drug, and they may be sold once the patent on that ingredient has expired.303 Generic copies usually sell at much lower prices than the original drug and thereby bring an im portant element of co mpetition to the market that can help to control costs.304 The Hatch-Waxman Act speeds the regulatory approval of generics by permitting their manufacturers to piggy back on the results of clinical trials for the original patented product.305 Rather than repeating all phases of testing, they only have to show th at their version is comparable to the original in the amount that the body absorbs.306 This means that testing can be completed more quickly and cheaply than it would if a full set of trials for safety and efficacy were required.307 To speed the process further, testing of a generic copy can begin while the original drug's patent is still in force.308 With this head start, the generic company can have its product approved and ready to be sold as soon as the patent expires.309 The Hatch-Waxman Act has dramatically reshaped the market for generic drugs. In 1984, the year it was passed, generics represented just 18.6% of American pharmaceutical sales.310 By 1997, that share had grown 303.

With the th reat of vigorous generic competition looming once a patent expires, they can no longer rely on a stock of established products to generate profits indefinitely but must continuously fill their pipelines with new drugs that have fresh patent clocks. This is a competitive force the market would lack were it not for this form of active government intervention. 2. Creating a Market for Orphan Drugs Congress authorized the FDA in 1983 to aid drug companies in producing medications for rare diseases when it passed the Orphan Drug Act. 313 Ailments that are extremely rare are known as \"orphan diseases\", because the small number of patients who suffer from them leaves potential treatments with a small potential market that is insufficient to generate profits.314 They include numerous conditions that are debilitating and even life threatening, such as Huntington's Disease, myoclonus, Lou Gehrig's disease, Tourette's syndrome, and muscular dystrophy.315 The Act authorized grants, tax credits, and seven years of additional market exclusivity beyond a patent's ex piration for drugs that are designed to treat conditions afflicting fewer than 200,000 people.316 The FDA also gives these products special consideration in the approval process.317 With this government boost, more than 300 treatments for orphan diseases received FDA approval in the 25 years following the law's enactment, compared with only ten during the previous ten years. 318 3.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2012] THE PRIVATE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY 45 testing for pediatric drugs can be difficult and risky.319 Children often react differently than adults to medications, and adverse effects can be more severe.320 To avoid the risks, most clinic al trials include only adults as subjects.321 As a result, the safety and effi cacy of new drugs when used to treat children are rarely known wit h accuracy when they are first approved.322 Pediatric testing often does not make financial sense for private companies because of the relatively sm all portion of the market involved, but there is still a significant need to determine how children will react to new drugs.323 To remedy this gap in market incentives, Congress in 1997 authorized special incentives to enco urage companies to conduct clinical trials in children in the form of FDAMA.324 That law offered companies a reward of six months of additional ma rket exclusivity after a patent expires for drugs that have undergone pediatric testing.325 In 1999, the FDA issued a related regulation known as the Pedi atric Rule, under which it requires companies to test some new drugs in children.326 The Act and the regulation are together credited with inducing companies to conduct a substantial number of pediatric studies, thereby exp anding the clinical uses as well as the market for many pharmaceutical products.327 4. The FDA and the Future of Genomic Medicine FDA's role in promoting generic d rugs, orphan drugs, and pediatric testing of new drugs arose from directives of Congress. In 2010, without waiting for new legislation, the agency acted on its own initiative to reshape the private market in another impo rtant area. It took steps to prod pharmaceutical companies to respond to the challenge of commercializing genomic medicine. It did so in partnersh ip with NIH as part of an effort to facilitate the advance of translational science. 328 Under this arrangement, 319. See Drug Research and Children , U.S. FOOD & DRUG ADMIN.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 46 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOUR NAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 6:11 NIH promotes research and training , while FDA encourages companies to integrate genomics into their drug development processes.329 To that end, it tries to coordinate the review of genetic diagnostic tests that predict responsiveness to drugs with review of the drugs themselves.330 The goal is to facilitate the development of diagnostic-therapeutic combination approaches that aid clinicians, along with a review process that reassures companies that new technologies in which they invest will receive prompt review.331 The NIH-FDA partnership builds on NIH's translational medicine initiative that extends the government infrastructure on which the nascent market for genomic medicine rests.332 In doing so, it will help to promote an even larger and more robust private pharmaceutical industry. The agencies acted in the belief that the market will not grow on its own but rather requires assistance from its indispens able partner, the government. In a joint statement, the heads of the agencies de scribed the model they created as a logical extension of the paradigm on whic h so much of American industry is built: When the federal government created the national highway system, it did not tell people where to drive \u2014 it built the roads and set the standards for safety. Those investments supported a revolution in transportation, commerce, and personal mobility. We are now building a national highway system for personalized medicine, with substantial investments in infrastructure and standards. 333 D. More Government Subs idies Through Tax Breaks In addition to these forms of regulatory support and funding for the infrastructure on which their research apparatus rests, the government also lends drug companies assistance of a mo re direct kind. It gives them money in the form of tax credits. 334 This financial boost lets pharmaceutical firms lower their tax bills, and thereby keep more of their income, by devoting resources to research.335 While the nature of the credits has changed over 329.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2012] THE PRIVATE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY 47 time with amendments to the federal ta x code, the underlying mechanism of paying private companies to conduct research has remained.336 Three kinds of tax credit are avail able to companies. A research and experimentation credit allows companie s to lower their taxes in return for increasing the amount they spend on in-house research.337 A basic research credit encourages companies to fund scientific investigations at universities.338 An orphan drug credit rewards the development of drugs for rare diseases as part of the Orphan Drug Act.339 These inducements, worth more than $5 billion a year, do not significantly alter the nature of the industry, and the benefits tend to accrue mainly to larger companies.340 However, they help to encourage the overall growth of the private research enterprise.341 In doing so, they form yet another government platform that has he lped the private market to flourish. E. The Most Fundamental Governme nt Support of All: Patents Beneath the billions of dollars and intricate web of laws and regulations that comprise the government's active in tervention to create and sustain the private pharmaceutical market lies an ev en more fundamental pillar. That is the protection that patent laws confer on its products. Without these laws, the industry could not exist in an ything close to its present form. Patents grant inventors 20 years fr om the date of filing to prevent anyone else from manufacturing, distri buting, or selling their inventions. 342 In effect, inventors enjoy a monopoly during this time and can take advantage of the lack of competition to set prices above those that a free market would sustain.343 The actual amount of time during which drugs can be marketed exclusively under a patent is less than the full 20 years in practice, because clinical testing and FDA review can eat up as much as half of the full patent term.344 However, the time remaining once marketing has begun has been more than sufficie nt to support ample profits for most 336.

Companies rely on patent protection as the bedrock of their economic model.347 Monopoly prices allow them to recoup research and development costs for new products, amass funds to investigate novel therapies that may no t make it to market, and generate substantial financial returns. 348 These prices provide the economic underpinning for the emergence of bloc kbuster drugs that bring companies billions of dollars in sales each year.349 The law of patents is rooted in th e United States Constitution, which authorizes Congress to protect property rights in inventions.350 The patent system that Congress established to effect uate this constitutional directive is administered by the USPTO, which decides whether inventions meet the criteria for patentability.351 Patents were not included in the Constitution or implemented by Congress with the pharma ceutical industry specifically in mind.352 Rather, they form a key underpinning of our entire economic system.353 Nevertheless, their application to drugs forms an indispensable part of the infrastructure that support s private pharmaceutical companies. Without this government foundation, the industry would take on a very different, and almost surely less profitable, form. V.

Medications for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cancer, depression, and Parkinson's disease, to name just a few examples, grew out of government-funded research findings.354 Along with the success of these drugs have ri dden the financial fortunes of many major pharmaceutical firms. Prime examples of successful public-pri vate drug development sit inside the medicine cabinets of millions of Americans. Two of them illustrate especially poignantly the importance of the partnership between NIH-funded discoveries and industry commercia lization. One reflects an ad hoc relationship, in which a collaboration evolved over time. The other emerged from an explicit effort by NIH to iden tify and work with a corporate ally. A. The Traditional Model: The Story of Statins Some drug success stories start withou t a clear plan. A discovery in basic research leads a private firm to devise a potential application that it investigates in its laboratories.355 Others are more haphazard. A firm may screen thousands of compounds hoping that one of them shows commercial promise based on directions identified in prior research.356 Whatever the approach, in conventional drug develo pment, private industry takes the laboring oar in vetting drug candidates, after government-funded basic research has pointed it in promising directions.357 The development of one of the most widely prescribed classes of drugs \u2014 statins \u2014 vividly tells the tale. A complex public-private partnership that evolved over the course of several decades led to the development of statins, which today are among the most important pharmacological therapies in medical practice. 358 These drugs are used by millions of people worldwide to reduce blood cholesterol levels.359 They have proven extremely effect ive at preventing heart attacks, strokes and other heart-related ailmen ts among those with high cholesterol or other risk factors such as diabetes.360 Heart disease is the most common 354.

The Link Between Cholesterol and Heart Disease The link between cholesterol and heart disease was first noted over 100 years ago.366 Dr. Rudolf Virchow, a German pathologist, observed on autopsy that patients who died of vascul ar conditions in which the arteries were narrowed, like heart attacks, ofte n had thickened and irregular artery walls.367 He found that the arterial walls in these patients were coated with a yellowish fatty substance, which he identified as cholesterol.368 Dr. Virchow was not able to explain the role of ch olesterol in the pathological changes he observed in artery walls or how it ge ts there, but he raised the intriguing possibility that this kind of fat co uld be connected with heart disease.369 The first clear evidence of an associ ation between high levels of blood cholesterol and the buildup of plaque in artery walls came from a large long-term epidemiological investigatio n of risk factors for heart disease date-FINAL.pdf; John C.

The government's support for the st udy paid off handsomely. The most widely acknowledged result is the identification of high cholesterol as a major cause of cardiac disease, but it also identified over ten other risk factors, including salt intake and smoking.376 Much of what is known today about heart disease and its prevention stems from this seminal research.377 2.

It enters the body from the outside through dietary intake of fatty foods.379 It is produced internally through synthesis in the liver.380 Dietary changes alone are often effective in reducing a patient's blood level, but when they are not, controlling cholesterol's internal manufacture represents the most likely alternative approach.381 Research to explore the body's mecha nisms of cholesterol synthesis was conducted by scientists starting in the 1940s at several universities, including Harvard, UCLA, the Max Planck Inst itute in Munich, and the National Institute for Medical Research in London.382 NIH funded most of the research that was carried out in the United States.383 The results of this work delineated the steps that lead to the liv er's manufacture of cholesterol and identified a way to disrupt the process by blocking the action of a key enzyme, hydroxymethy l glutaryl reductase for short.384 The findings set the stage for a search for drugs that might serve this function. The first challenge in finding a drug candidate was to locate a reliable source of the enzyme to use in tests.385 In 1960, a method was devised for isolating it from baker's yeast, along with a test to determine whether a drug candidate was effective at inhibiting its activity.386 These techniques were based on technologies that had been developed in the 1950s with support from NIH and the National Science Foundation (NSF), another federal agency that funds basic science research. 387 With the technology in place to co nduct the search, the hunt began for inhibitor molecules. In the early 1970s, it peaked the interest of private pharmaceutical firms. One company in particular, Sankyo Pharmaceuticals in Japan, devised a method for eval uating molecular candidates in molds.388 In 1976, it found one in a species related to the strain of mold 378.

A Private Manufacturer Tests the Waters With the identification of a molecule that could block the liver's synthesis of cholesterol and the refinement of techniques to produce it in large quantities, the next step was for a phar maceutical company to try to bring a product to market. The first to take up the challenge was Merck.393 However, even in this commercial ende avor, it was only by collaborating with the government that success was achieved.394 In 1979, scientists at Merck isolated an inhibitor molecule that seemed a likely drug candidate, a substance known as lovastatin that is similar to compactin.395 The company soon initiated clinic al trials to examine its safety and effectiveness.396 Unfortunately for the effort, at about this time, the World Health Organization reported result s of a clinical trial of another new lipid lowering drug, and they were extremely disappointing.397 There was actually a higher mortality rate for pat ients on the drug than for those on a placebo.398 Then in 1980, Merck received reports suggesting that compactin could cause cancer in dogs.399 The company's CEO, P. Roy Vagelos, who had strongly championed the quest for a cholesterol blocker, decided to terminate the clinical trials.400 With the private sector faltering in the quest for what promised to be a miracle drug, the government decided to step back in.

The FDA convinced Merck to make lovastatin available to researchers at Oregon Health Sciences University and at the University of Texas.402 Once these supplies were in the hands of academic rese archers, the agency granted them permission to conduct new trials in human subjects.403 Merck also agreed to grant the investigators access to the drug's master file, the collection of public and proprietary information on it that the company had accumulated and that was maintained by the FDA.404 In 1984, the gloom surrounding the pr ospects for statins started to lift with encouraging news on two fronts. Results of a large clinical trial released that year showed that cholesterol lo wering by any mean s, whether dietary changes or medications, could produce a significant drop in heart disease and death.405 And new genetic research on patients with high cholesterol succeeded in elucidating the means by which the most dangerous kind of cholesterol, LDL, is disposed of by the liver.406 The scientists who made that discovery, Dr. Michael Brown and Dr. Joseph Goldstein, were awarded the Nobel Prize the following year.407 With prospects looking up for lowe ring cholesterol pharmacologically based on the university-based research, Merck revived its own work on lovastatin in 1983.408 It was not long before the company had accumulated enough data to submit an application to the FDA for approval to market the drug.409 The agency took only nine months to act on lovastatin, one of the shortest approval times up to that point.410 Once the FDA had acted, Merck began marketing lovastatin under the brand name Mevacor in 1987.411 It brought another statin, simvastatin, to the market at about the same time under the name Zocor.412 By 1998, sales of Zocor had reached $4.7 billion worldwide.413 402.

These included Lipitor, from the Parke-Davis division of Wa rner Lambert, now a part of Pfizer, Pravacol from Sankyo and Bristol- Myers Squibb, and Lescol from Novartis.414 Most of these products became blockbuster drugs, generating more than $1 billion in annual sales and serving as financial anchors for the companies that sold them. 415 4. The Next Generation of Statins Even with this remarkable clinical and economic success, work to improve the effectiveness of statins co ntinued. Scientists were especially interested in finding new inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis that might be easier to produce in large quantities.416 That work relied heavily on computer graphics programs developed at the University of California at San Diego that permitted researchers to visualize and manipulate the three- dimensional structure of molecules.417 Previous methods of testing new drug candidates had required that they ac tually be synthesized, a much more expensive and time-consuming process.418 Computer graphics allowed molecules to be vetted based on computational models.419 The software behind this capability grew out of research funded by NSF and the Department of Defense. 420 It led to the creation of new statins that were simpler in structure and substantia lly cheaper to produce, including fluvastatin by Sandoz and atorvastat in by the Parke-Davis division of Warner-Lambert.421 Statins today are a mainstay of card iac care and prevention. Over one- quarter of all Americans over the age of 45 take them.422 They generate more than $30 billion in sales worldwide.423 Lipitor has not only been the top selling drug in the world for several years but is also the world's all-time 414.

The Formal Approach: A Miracle in the Woods and the Development of Taxol Statins emerged from accumulations of basic research that built up over time and increasingly pointed to clinical applications.428 Collaborations between the public and private sector s that produced the final products evolved as the discoveries emerged. The arrangements were sometimes implicit and occasionally spontaneous. Other drugs emerge from explicit partnerships between the government and private companies, most commonly in the form of CRADAs. Perhaps the most prominent example of a success in such an explicit collaboration is the development of Taxol, the best-selling cancer drug in history.429 It has extended the lives of thousands of woma n suffering from ovarian and breast cancer and would never have been invented but for decades of effort by government scientists and millions of dollars of investment by government agencies.430 1.

Public-Private Collabora tion to Produce a Drug The story of Taxol is a tale of differe nt sectors of the country's scientific enterprise working together under the structure that Congress had developed to promote such cooperatio n. After USDA's initial finding of Taxol's potential anti-carcinogenic effect s, efforts began in earnest to isolate the active compound involved.442 Research was conducted within USDA, at NCI, and at several universities and pr ivate research institutes supported by NIH grants.443 In 1971, after almost a decade of effort, Drs. Monroe Wall and M.D. Wani of Research Triangle Institute announced that they had identified the chemical structure of the seemingly miraculous substance.444 In 1979, researchers at the Albert Einste in College of Medicine in New York delineated the mechanism through which it works.445 NCI received permission from the FDA to begin clinical trials of the drug in 1982.446 As these studies progressed through the 1980s, they increasingly pointed to effectiveness in treating the disease.447 Final results for the second phase of the clinical trials were released in 1988 and showed a response rate of 30% among patients with the most virulent form of ovarian cancer. 448 I n s o m e t e s t s , t h e r a t e w a s a s h i g h a s 6 0 % .449 Such positive findings were unprecedented for an anti-cancer agent.450 Not surprisingly, Taxol's success le d to a surge in demand for it.451 However, sufficient supplies were difficu lt to come by. The original process for extracting Taxol required between 10,000 and 30,000 pounds of dried bark to produce one kilogram of the drug.452 NCI estimated that in order to treat all the ovarian cancer patients who needed Taxol, 360,000 yew trees would have to be harvested every ye ar, which made its use impractical.453 The answer was to create a synthetic version, and scientists in the United States, Asia and Europe labored th rough the 1980s toward this goal.454 442.

By 1989, the government, though USDA and NCI, had discovered paclitaxel in the forests of the Northwest, isolated it, and establis hed its clinical utility. An academic partner, FSU, had found a way to manu facture it without causing massive deforestation. With this much accomplis hed, NCI saw its role dwindling. It had spent over $25 million and did not have the resources for the next step, which was to produce the synthetic comp ound in sufficient quantities to be brought to market for large numbers of patients.458 The government needed a partner with the wherewitha l to meet this challenge. 3. Bringing a Product to Market In 1989, soon after FSU's successf ul synthesis of paclitaxel, NCI solicited interest from pharmaceutical companies to enter into a CRADA to commercialize it. 459 Of the four that responded, one stood out as the most prepared for the task, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS).460 In addition to extensive experience with oncology products, BMS had a track record of successful collaboration with the federal governme nt in the development of an early treatment for AIDS. 461 To NCI, the company seemed the natural choice, and in 1991, it selected BMS for a CRAD A to bring paclitaxel to market.462 The CRADA turned out to be one of the firs t to result in wide availability of a breakthrough drug.463 Soon after NCI announced its search for a CRADA partner but before the agreement had been finalized, BMS began to explore Taxol's potential.464 It obtained a license to use FSU's technique for semisynthesis of the drug the following year.465 The license also applied prospectively to any 455.

BMS gained the ability to market an extremely lucrative drug, and FSU received over $200 million of dollars in royalties, among the largest financial paybacks that any university had received from a technology transfer agreement up to that time.467 During the early years of testing, NI H performed or funded most of the clinical trials on Taxol.468 BMS supplied the drug to NIH researchers to facilitate the trials, which had been in short supply.469 Over the course of the CRADA, the number of research subjec ts participating rose from about 500 in 1989 to 28,882 at over 40 treatment centers.470 This led to a faster pace of testing, which enabled BMS to speed the process.471 It received approval from the FDA to market Taxol for tr eating ovarian cancer in December 1992, and the drug began reaching patients the following month.472 NIH invested a considerable amount of resources in the development and testing of Taxol both during the CRADA and after it had expired.473 The total value of its investment before the CRADA's expiration is estimated at $183 million.474 In the five years after the CRADA expired in 1997, it spent an additional $301 million, placing the total NIH investment at $484 million. 475 BMS provided a partial offset by supplying NIH with supplies of the drug valued at $92 mil lion for use in the trials.476 BMS estimates that for its part, it spent about $1 billion in developing Taxol.477 The return on this investment was more than adequate.

In 1993, a single gram of Taxol cost $5,846.481 On its revenues, BMS owed NIH a royalty of 0.5% based on a license agreement that had been reached in 1996.482 The resulting payments totaled $35 million.483 While this was a tiny amount compared to BMS's overall returns on the drug, it was en ough to repay a sizeable share of the government's investment.484 BMS owed some of its return on Taxol to another government source.485 Public insurance in the form of Medica re covered the cost of the drug for most elderly patients.486 Reimbursement totaled $687 million from 1994 to 1999, the year that a generic version of Taxol was approved.487 And in 1999, Medicare payments represented over one-fifth of the drug's domestic sales.488 4. Public-Private Bargaining Over Finances BMS entered the negotiations that led to the CRADA in a strong bargaining position.

An Additional Lifesaving Use The success of the CRADA between NIH and BMS was only part of the story. Beyond the value of paclitaxel in treating cancer, the drug also found an important use in cardiac care.507 After the oncology benefits had been established, researchers discovered that it discourages the growth of scar tissue around the sites of metal stents th at are inserted into clogged arteries to prop them open.508 Scarring can lead to the re-deposit of clog-inducing plaque.509 This second use of paclitaxel was again the offshoot of a government effort, as the initial research was conducted by two scientists working at NIH.510 Based on the finding of value in protecting the sites of cardiac stents, the agency entered into a CRADA with a company called Angiotech to commercialize this use of the drug.511 Angiotech sublicensed its rights to Boston Scientific, which applied for FDA approval to market paclitaxel for coating cardiac stents under the name TAXUS. 512 The path to approval was eased by the drug's safety record in the previous clinical trials involving cancer treatment.513 The product was approved for the new use, and it went on to become a clinical and commercial success, with millions of paclitaxel- coated stents sold worldwide and generating sales of over $3 billion.514 6.

Through a series of laws that encouraged public-private collaboration and an initial government-funded research effort, a previously unknown substance emerged from the woods of the Pacific Northwest to become a life-sa ving product. The effort produced huge financial rewards for a drug company, a device company, and a university that played an instrumen tal role in its development. Most importantly, it has extended the lives of millions of patients around the world. C. The Next Era in Drug Development and the Promise of More Success Stories A new era in drug development dawned in the 1990s thanks to a new approach called combinatorial chemistry.515 It permits scientists to create libraries of thousands of compounds th at can be tested as candidates to perform specific functions, like inhibi ting HMG CoA reductase in the liver to block the synthesis of cholesterol.516 Within the time span of a few months, millions of such candidates can be test ed for efficacy, a level of efficiency that was not previously possible.517 The new approach has begun to revolutionize private drug development. It is now the principal method for finding new medications of every kind, and it yields results with dramatic new speed.518 By way of comparison, the old technology had enabl ed Merck to synthesize, purify and screen about 250,000 different chemicals in the 60 years between 1934 and 1994.519 In the four years between 1995 and 1999, using combinatorial chemistry techniques, it synthesized and tested 4.5 million.520 Like so many other technological advances that have bolstered the financial prospects of private pharma ceutical companies, combinatorial chemistry was devised by scientists who relied on NIH for financial support.521 Beyond the pharmaceutical manufacturers that use it, a burgeoning new industry now supports its application. A raft of companies provides instrumentation, chemical re-agents, and software.522 Through them, the government investment in advancing the process of drug development has sent ripples through a large swath of the private sector.523 515.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 2012] THE PRIVATE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY 65 VI. THE \"FREE-MARKET \" PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY AND THE GOVERNMENT A. What Would the Industry Look Like Without the Government? Let us turn to the fundamental question that underlies this article. How did the pharmaceutical industry, wh ich has remained among the most profitable for decades, get that wa y? Certainly, entrepreneurship and innovation played a tremendously important part in maintaining the robustness of drug companies over th e years. Market forces continuously prod private companies to devise ne w products and stay ahead of the competition. However, those companie s must have raw materials to work with in their intellectual arsenal. For pharmaceutical firms, that is basic knowledge of human biology. Over the past three-quarters of a century, the greatest producer of that knowledge by far has been the United States government. We can highlight the government's role in creating and maintaining the pharmaceutical industry by asking what the industry would look like without its government base. Without question, it would still exist. Pharmaceuticals date back almost as far as recorded history.524 Ancient Egyptian writings describe pharmaceutical preparations, as do the records of almost every early civilization.525 Private companies, as well as individuals, have been manufacturing drug products since colo nial times in America, long before there was an NIH to support research or an FDA to oversee quality.526 But what would that industry look like without the pillars of government support that emerged in the twentieth ce ntury? It would almost certainly be a shadow of its present self. Virtually every major drug that has supported private pharmaceutical profits over the past 50 years was developed with government support in one form or anot her. In no field of medicine would available treatments approach the range or effectiveness that they do today. Imagine cardiac care without statins, oncology care without paclitaxel, or care for AIDS without AZT. In fact, it is impossible to name any medical specialty that does not today depend fo r its pharmacological tools, in some cases almost entirely, on investment by the government and the innovation it spawned. 524.

SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW 66 SAINT LOUIS UNIVERSITY JOUR NAL OF HEALTH LAW & POLICY [Vol. 6:11 B. Could Private Industry Have Made It on Its Own? We know what the government has contri buted, but it would also be fair to ask whether the industry might have accomplished these or similar advances on its own. Without NIH, might private entrepreneurs have mustered the resources to meet the bas ic science challenges that created modern medicine? Perhaps the same market forces that promote applied research in bringing products to market could have supported the advances in biology that underlie it. To answer that question, we can look to the stories behind some of the most important fruits of government in tervention. Merck was ready to give up on statins before NIH and the FDA stepped in with a helping hand.527 Government scientists combed the forest s of the Pacific Northwest in search of anti-carcinogens, eventually discov ering paclitaxel, at a time when private companies showed little interest.528 And beyond these examples, the development of countless othe r drugs tells a similar tale.529 As we look to the future of medic ine, we can ask whether any private company could have devoted the resources to mapping the human genome, the essential first step in open ing the door to genetic medicine. The investment required was huge and the knowledge gained will require decades to commercialize. Moreover, it s findings are public information available to everyone, including comp eting companies, to take advantage of. 530 What private investors would have allowed their funds to be used in this way? C. Has the Government Acted Wisely? Government support for the pharmaceut ical industry has its share of critics. Many see the large amounts of money that are given as an undeserved subsidy for an industry th at could be amply profitable on its own. 531 They point in particular to companies that patent discoveries based on NIH-funded research, thereby stakin g an ownership claim in a publicly funded resource.532 They ask why private ventures should be allowed to reap 527.

In the case of Taxol, NIH received $35 million on behalf of taxpayers under a licensing agreement with BMS after spending almost $500 million to test the drug.534 By the time it first faced generic competition, BMS had earned over $11 billion.535 The company claimed that it invested $1 billion of its own money in applied research to bring Taxol to market, but even with this expense , its rate of return dwarfed that of NIH.536 Is it fair that a private entity should profit so handsomely from an invention that would not have been po ssible without substantial government investment? Tax subsidies for research and development often come in for especially harsh criticism.537 Do highly profitable companies really need a subsidy to invest in research, when they would ha ve to make the investment anyway to remain competitive? Perhaps the go vernment already gives the industry enough research support through NIH. FDA oversight of safety is also often questioned as too lax.538 Several drugs with dangerous side effects have slipped through the vetting process, sometimes after receiving accelerated review.539 The result has been recalls and additional warnings after reports of patient harm.540 Vioxx, for example, was approved on an expedited basis as a treatment for arthritic pain, and its 533.

The system of support could undoubtedly be improved in many wa ys. However, whatever the optimal level of support, government investment has over the years been, and remains today, crucial to the industry 's wellbeing. Whatever shortcomings the system may have, we have clearly gotten a robust and highly profitable set of companies and a cascade of new drugs in return for the government's involvement. The pharmaceutical industry would not exist in the form it takes today, with all of its accomplishments an d faults, but for a hundred years of government intervention. D. Conclusion: Public Investment and Private Industry Pharmaceuticals are developed, manu factured, sold, and distributed in the United States through the priv ate sector. Private investment and competition among firms drive the se ctor's economics. These dynamics characterize what is typically thought of as a \"free-market.\" However, the market does not exist because the go vernment stepped aside and let private enterprise operate without constraint. Quite to the contrary, it operates precisely because the government has in sinuated itself into almost every aspect of the business. 541. Vioxx (rofecoxib) Questions and Answers , U.S. FOOD & DRUG "}
