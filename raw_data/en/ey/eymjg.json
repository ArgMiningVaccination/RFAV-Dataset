Acupuncture is recognized by the National Institute of Health and the World Health Organization to be an effective treatment for many illnesses and conditions, doing so by stimulating the body to naturally correct imbalances in the flow of energy - Qi (Chee). This is done by inserting ultra-fine, sterile disposable acupuncture needles underneath the skin at specific points in the body. With the insertion of fine needles the energy can be moved or redirected to where it is needed most. These acupuncture points are related to energy pathways or meridians that run throughout the entire length of the body. When the flow of Qi is disrupted due to stress, trauma, poor diet, injury or other condition, pain, illness, and even psychological and emotional disorders can result.
