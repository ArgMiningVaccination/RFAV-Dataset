That means there's not as much oversight of the industry as a whole compared with, say, prescription drugs. (Although the FDA may regulate some probiotics as drugs if they are being marketed as a way to treat a disease or disorder, according to the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health](https://nccih.nih.gov/health/probiotics/introduction.htm).)

When shopping for a quality probiotic, here are some of the things to look for: Signs of a good probiotic brand Transparency in labeling is important. \"Probiotic brands should be labeled to include the genus, species, and strain\u2014and the quantities should be declared in colony-forming units (CFUs),\" says Sylvia Laman, managing toxicologist of dietary supplements at NSF International, a public health and safety organization in Ann Arbor, Michigan. For instance, if you look at the label of Bio-K Plus, one of the main probiotics listed is Lactobacillus acidophilus CL1285. Lactobacillus is the genus, acidophilus is the species, and CL1285 is the strain. \"In addition, consumers should consider purchasing probiotic-containing supplements from manufacturers committed to verifying the identity and safety of probiotic ingredients,\" advises Laman. \"Consumers can make informed decisions when choosing supplement brands by conducting their own research, contacting supplement manufacturers directly, or seeking products that are tested and verified by a third party.\" For immune health: Bio-K Plus \"There are hundreds of strains of edible bacteria known as probiotics found in food, as well as available in supplement form,\" says [Kristin Gustashaw](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/kristin-ar-gustashaw-ms-rd-ldn-csg), MS, RDN, an advanced clinical dietitian at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. \"L. acidophilus is known to support a healthy digestive system and sustain and boost your immune system.\" She says it can also protect against the damage bad bacteria like Salmonella or E. coli can have on your digestive system. \"If you are looking to supplement your diet with L. acidophilus, Bio-K Plus is a reputable brand.\" Check out some of the other [health benefits of probiotics](https://www.thehealthy.com/nutrition/probiotics/health-benefits-of-probiotics/).
