Seasonal movements, habitat selection, physiological health, and demography of Shiras moose ( Alces alces shirasi ) were studied in Jackson Valley of northwest Wyoming. Moose congregated on low-elevatio n ranges during winter and migrated to more dispersed, mid-elevation ranges during summer. Moose select ed winter habitat dominated by deciduous shrubs, whereas they selected summer habitat that was more variable. Blood parameters indicated that m oose were in moderate physical condition. Ultrasonic rump fat measurements were relatively high, but there were indications of nutritional deficiencies. Diseases and parasites appeared to have minimal population- level effects. Population m odeling suggested that the m oose population was more likely to be declining than stable or increasing a nd the population growth rate was influenced primarily by late-winter and early-spring adu lt female mortality. Pregnancy rates were high, but calf production was relatively low. Neonate and annual calf survival were relatively high. Habitat quali ty appeared to be the primary factor limiting population growth while the effects of predation appeared to be less important. HABITAT SELECTION, CONDITION, AND SURVIVAL OF SHIRAS MOOSE IN NORT HWEST WYOMING by Scott A. Becker A thesis submitted to the Department of Zoology and Physiology and the Graduate School of the University of Wyoming in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of MASTER OF SCIENCE in ZOOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY Laramie, Wyoming December 2008 DEDICATION Dedicated to the memory of: Stanley H. Anderson 1939 - 2005 ii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS A project of this ma gnitude could not have been accomplished alone and the support of many individuals from numerous agencies was vital to its success. I am forever grateful to my origin al graduate advisor, the late Stanley H. Anderson, for his belief in my abilities to accomplish this ta sk and for providing me the opportunity to study a fascinating critter, the moose. A lthough I was not a \"fish-head,\" I cannot thank Wayne Hubert enough for the guidance and support he provided as my committee co-chair during the later stages of this project. I also thank Matt Kauffman who arrived half- way through this project, but stepped in a nd admirably provided much needed guidance as my committee co-chair. I would also like to thank my three remaining committee members, Frederick Lindzey, Charles Ande rson, and Thomas Thurow, for stimulating discussions and the support they provided throughout. The assistance and guidance offered by Mandi Larson and Linda Ohler helped keep me in-line and prevented me from missing deadlines. This project would not have been possible without funding and support provided by the Teton County Conser vation District, Wyoming Animal Damage Management Board, Wyoming Department of Transportation, Wyoming Game and Fish Department, and the Wyoming Governor's Big Game License Coalition/Wildlife Heritage Foundation of Wyoming. There are many other individuals from a ll walks of life who have contributed a great deal of time and effort to this proj ect. I thank Doug Brimey er for recognizing the necessity of this research and securing mu ch needed funding. Without his determination, the Jackson moose project would never have materialized. Steve Kilpatrick and Sarah Dewey continually provided more than their shar e of field assistance. I am grateful to iii Terry Kreeger who hung out of the helicopter wh en it was -30\u00b0F to dart moose. I extend my sincerest gratitude to the pilots: Gary Lu st (retired) of Mountain Air Research, Dave (and Nora and Ashes) Savage of Savage Air Services, and Da ve Stinson of Sky Aviation. Without their skills and abilities in the air, I would not have been able to accomplish half of what I set out to do. Trent McDonald, Ryan Nielson, and Hall Sawyer of Western Ecosystems Technology provided a great deal of assistance with habitat selection techniques. Without their help, I would proba bly still be trying to figure out R-code. Cody Beers and Michael Patritch of the Wyoming Department of Transportation provided needed data, support, assistance, and we re always available to answer questions. The Triangle X Ranch and the many landow ners in the Buffalo Valley deserve special recognition. I thank Mark Gocke fo r all the great photos, Bill Long and Tim Fuchs for hopping in the helicopter during sp ring and summer surveys, Dave Moody and Dan Bjornlie for field assistance and additional funding, Judy and Larry Robinson for help with housing and captures, Hank Edwards and Todd Cornish for assistance with biological samples and for entertaining my physiology questions, Jeff Beck for assistance with survival analyses, Steve Prager and Eli Rodemaker for GIS assistance, Theo Schuff for ultrasound assistance, Tom Laurion and Kathy Firchow for bringing the mules and horses over the pass so we could chase some moose in the back-country, Harold and Loretta Lemons for the dinners and the long hours of conversation in the Blackrock lot, and Doug and Peggy Sobey for field assist ance. Although I cannot mention everyone individually, a huge thank you goes out to the many Wyoming Game and Fish Department, Grand Teton National Park, Bri dger-Teton National Forest, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Beringia South personne l who assisted with moose captures and iv many other aspects of this study. Frequent discussions with Chuck Schwartz, Tom Lohuis, Eric W ald, and moose biologists throughout North America were helpful and thought-provoking. A very special thank you goes out to Hank and Mary Ann Harlow for the many moose expeditions we partook in, for assistance with navigating the University of Wyoming library, and for th e many BBQs and beverages shared at the AMK Ranch. I also thank my fellow gradua te students for helping me remain sane throughout this endeavor. I extend a heartfelt thanks to my parents, Ken and Ann Becker, for their constant encouragement and support. It took a wh ile, but I have finally landed a job with \"benefits!!\" I thank my dog, Tuff, for being patient with me during the writing process - I promise I will take you for a run in the hills again! Finally, I would like to extend my sincerest gratitude to Andrea Barbknecht. When I thought I would never be able to get this completed, her constant encouragement helped me through. Andrea stuck by me through thick and thin and, for that, I will be forever grateful. v TABLE OF CONTENTS LIST OF TABLES ......................................................................................................... viii LIST OF FIGURES ......................................................................................................... ix LIST OF APPENDICES ................................................................................................ xii CHAPTER 1.

A final report submitted to the Wyoming Department of Transportation . ..............................................179 xii 1 CHAPTER 1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION It is generally believed the first modern moose ( Alces alces ) arrived in North America from Siberia via the Bering la nd bridge during the last ice age 10,000-14,000 years ago (Peterson 1955, Bubenik 1997, Bowyer et al. 2003, Hundertma rk et al. 2003). With the retreat of the continental glaciers , moose began to inhabit portions of North America once covered with ice, although the exact patterns of dispersal and speciation are debated (Peterson 1955, B ubenik 1997, Bowyer et al. 2003, Hundertmark et al. 2003). Nevertheless, 4 distinct subspecies of m oose evolved in North America, each strongly associated with the distribution of coniferous forests. The Eastern or Taiga moose ( A.a. Americana ) occur from Ontario, Canada Atlantic Ocean; the Northwestern moose ( A.a. andersoni ) inhabit the region from western Ontario, Canada and northern Michigan, USA to British Co lumbia and the Yukon Territory, Canada; Alaskan moose ( A.a. gigas ) primarily inhabit Alaska, USA, but also occur in western Yukon Territory, Canada; and Shiras moose ( A.a. shirasi ) inhabit the Intermountain West along the Rocky Mountains from Colorado, USA to southern Alberta and southeastern British Columbia, Canada (Bubenik 1997). Few, if any, moose existed in Wyo ming prior to 1850 (Houston 1968, Brimeyer and Thomas 2004). Between 1834 and 1843, Osborne Russell traveled extensively throughout western Wyoming and kept a detailed journal of his travels yet never mentioned observing a moose although descripti ons of other wildlife species were noted (Haines 1955). Sporadic obser vations of moose occurred in northwest Wyoming after 1850 (Houston 1968), but it is believed the popul ation did not begin to increase and expand until after the establishment of Yellowstone National Park (YNP) in 1872 (Peterson 1955, Denniston 1956). By the la te 1890s and early 1900s, observations of moose in the Jackson Valley were on the ri se (Peterson 1955). Houston (1968) believed that a self-sustaining moose population in th e Jackson Valley occurred shortly before 1912 via emigrations from YNP. Moose m anagement in Wyoming began shor tly after moose appeared in the state (Blair 1987). In 1882, the fi rst hunting seasons for moose were set from 1 August through 15 November in an attempt to protect the species fr om overexploitation. However, by 1899, moose numbers were in decl ine so the Wyoming legislature granted moose full protection from harvest for at least 10 years (Brimeyer and Thomas 2004). By 1912, there were an estimated 500 moose in Wyoming, predominately in the northwest region, and populations were deemed large e nough to sustain limited harvest (Brimeyer and Thomas 2004). From that time, moose popul ations have continued to increase in Wyoming and, through natural emigration or tr anslocation, currently occupy almost all available habitats in the state. Concurrent with moose population expans ion in northwest Wyoming was a large- scale predator reduction program to protect livestock and game animals (Blair 1987). During the late 1800s and early 1900s, stat e and federal predator removal programs greatly reduced large carnivore populations in the state. Gray wolves ( Canis lupus ) were extirpated by the 1930s (Weaver 1978, Wyomin g Game and Fish Department [WGFD] 2007 a) while reduced. By 1940, most grizzly bears were rest ricted to YNP (Blair 1987). Grizzly bears 2 were listed as \"threatened\" under the Endangered Species Act in 1975 (Fed. Reg. 40:145, 31734-31736) and since the early 1990s, have steadily expanded their range in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (Schwartz et al. 2006). Gray wolves were reintroduced into YNP in 1995 and 1996 (Bangs and Fritts 1996) and were first observed in the Jackson Valley during the winter of 1997-1998 (Sm ith et al. 1999). At present, cougar populations are suspected to be increasing statewide (WGFD 2006). Although historical data are lacking for black bears ( U. americanus ), harvest data sugge st a stable population trend (WGFD 2007 b). Early moose research in northwest Wyom ing occurred during the period when large predators were less common. Most st udies examined the winter food habits and social dynamics of moose in the Ja ckson Valley (Rudersdorf 1952, Denniston 1956, Harry 1957, Altmann 1959). Humans were pres umed to be the primary predator of moose (Denniston 1956) and, due to the lack of large predators, several studies reported overutilization of winter ranges and a n eed to reduce wintering moose numbers (Rudersdorf 1952, Harry 1957). H ouston (1968) provided extens ive data on the habitat relationships, life habits, a nd population dynamics of moose in the Jackson Valley during the mid-1960s. He suggested that moose populations fluctuated between 1950 and 1966 in response to the condition of willows on winter range and periodic die-offs that occurred during severe winters. He also i ndicated that disease a nd parasites had little influence on the dynamics of the Jackson moose herd. During the late 1970s, the nor th Jackson moose herd was in decline, possibly exacerbated by liberal harvest of antlerless m oose (Figure 1.1; WGFD 1982). Therefore, antlerless moose licenses were reduced and moose responded by slowly increasing in 3 numbers until the late 19 80s (WGFD 1990). A dditionally, there were concerns regarding a rise in the number of elk ( Cervus elaphus ) wintering in the Buffalo Valley that may have been competing with moose for winter browse. It was suspected that higher elk numbers were a result of conservative harvest during the 1980s, a series of mild winters, and public feeding programs (WGFD 1988). As a result, elk harvest was increased in 1989 (WGFD 1990) and elk winter range improveme nt projects were in itiated to reduce the potential effects of competition. There wa s also a need to improve moose winter ranges (WGFD 1991) and several improvement projects were implemented in the early 1990s. Nonetheless, moose trend counts and calf -cow ratios began to decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s and it was suspected that the 1988 wildfires might have been more detrimental to moose than originally belie ved (WGFD 1991). Since the early 1990s, the population has continued to fluctuate, however, as of 2007, population trend counts were near levels observed in the late 1970s and calf-cow ratios were the lowest observed during the previous 30 years (Figure 1.1). Because of this decline, research was in itiated to determine the factors impacting the north Jackson moose herd. It was suspected that habitat quality had declined due to high moose densities, resulting in pregnancy rates that were among the lowest reported in North America ( 75%; Berger et al. 1999, Berger et al. 2001 a). It was also suspected that because grizzly bears had recently expa nded into the study area, na\u00efve moose were more vulnerable to pred ation (Berger et al. 2001 b) and, as a result, parturient moose increased their use of areas closer to roads to avoid bear predation (Berger 2007). Although previous research provided much information regarding certain aspects of moose dynamics in northwest Wyoming, th ere was a need for research on specific 4 aspects of Shiras moose ecology. Th erefore, I utilized global positioning system (GPS) and very high frequency (VHF) radio collars to assess reproductive parameters, calf and adult survival, seasonal distri bution, and seasonal hab itat selection patterns. Furthermore, I examined the physiological h ealth of this herd via blood, hair, and ultrasonic rump fat measurements. Information provided from th is study can be used to assess potential mechanisms limiting the north Jackson moose herd and can provide a framework to direct future research to an swer more specific questions. Research Goals and Objectives The primary goal of this study was to pr ovide insight into the life-history characteristics of Shiras moose in northwest Wyoming and to use this information to examine potential factors contributing to the possible population declines recently observed in the north Jackson moose herd. The results can assist land and wildlife managers in identifying appropriate manage ment strategies that can benefit moose populations in northwest Wyoming. Th ere were three primary objectives: (1) Investigate the seasonal distribution and habitat selection patterns of adult female Shiras moose in northwest Wyoming (Chapter 2); (2) Evaluate the physical condition and nutritional status of adult female Shiras moose (Chapter 3); and (3) Estimate reproductive parameters, calf survival, adult female and male survival, and the finite rate of popula tion growth for the north Jackson moose herd and make preliminary inferences regarding potential limiting factors (Chapter 4). 5 In addition to the above objectives, I also investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics of moose highway crossings along a 9.7-km section of U.S. Highway 26/287 that bisects crucial m oose winter range in the Buffalo Fork Valley of northwest Wyoming (Appendix A). These results can assi st transportation and wildlife managers in identifying, evaluating, and implementing highw ay designs and mitigation that improve the safety of motorists by reducing the risk of moose-vehicle collisions while maintaining highway permeability for moose. Thesis Organization This thesis consists of five chapters, three of which ar e intended for publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Chapter 1 includes a general in troduction that provides background information and my research obj ectives, while Chapter 5 includes general conclusions from my research and provides recommendations for management and future research. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 are in the format required for submission to appropriate scientific journals. The spat ial and temporal characteristics of moose highway crossings is included as Appendix A and is in the format required for a final re port that has been submitted to the Wyoming Department of Transportation. 6 LITERATURE CITED Altmann, M. 1959.

Although researchers and wildlife managers recognize this need, st udies often focus on ha bitat selection during winter when resources are most limited and management actions are likely to benefit a large number of individuals (Hundertmark et al. 1990, Pearson et al. 1995, D'Eon and Serrouya 2005, Poole and Stuart-Smith 2006). However, several aspects of ungulate ecology act to link the dynamics of animals across seasonal ranges. For example, the overwinter survival of bighorn sheep lambs ( Ovis canadensis ) was influenced more by weather, and its potential effects on forage production, the previous spring than by the severity of winter conditions (Portier et al. 1998). Similarly, several studies have suggested that forage limita tions on summer range can redu ce maternal body condition resulting in decreased reproductive success the following year for elk ( Cervus elaphus ; Cook et al. 2004), ; Cameron 1994), and moose ( alces ; Testa and Adams 1998). These 11 interrelationships among seasonal moveme nts and the dynamics of populations challenge our understanding and management of many ungulate species (Gor don et al. 2004). Moose are typical of te mperate ungulates in whic h individuals within a population have distinct wint er and summer ranges linked by migrations of varied distances (Edwards and Ritcey 1956, LeResc he et al. 1974, DeMarchi 2003). Different migratory strategies have evolved to maxi mize individual fitness due to the seasonal availability of forage in temperate environm ents (Fryxell and Sinc lair 1988). Migratory ungulates typically benefit by increasing their access to high quality forage during summer, whereas nonmigratory (i.e., reside nt) ungulates may remain on lower quality summer range but reduce their risk of pred ation (Nicholson et al. 1997, Hebblewhite et al. 2006). The availability of forage can also influence the size of seasonal home ranges. Resources are often restricted during winter due to snow accumulations, so moose generally seek winter habitats that provide for a high quantity of forage in a relatively small area (Dussault et al. 2005 a). In contrast, summer home ranges are typically larger because the availability of forage is not limited by environmental conditions (Houston 1968, Cederlund and Okarma 1988, Kufeld and Bowden 1996). Thus, moose habitat selection patterns may be governed by the amount or quality of resources available on seasonal ranges (Peek 1997). In general, moose select for shrub-dominated, open habitats in winter, but may make use of cl osed-canopy areas as envi ronmental conditions warrant (Philips et al. 19 73, Matchet 1985, Hundertmark et al. 1990, Stephenson et al. 2006). As summer approaches, moose make use of a variety of open habitats then shift use to more closed-canopy areas during late summer possibly due to phenological changes in the quality of forage (Hjelford et al. 1990, Peek 1997). By understanding the 12 spatial distribution of moose across the landsca pe, managers ma y be able to gain insight into habitat alterations that imp act moose population performance. The understanding of Shiras moose ( A. a. shirasi ) seasonal distributions and habitat selection in the Inte rmountain West is limited. Early research was primarily observational in nature and used univari ate approaches on a limited number of individuals to assess movement and habitat selection patterns. Nonetheless, Shiras moose have been associated with low- elevation ranges duri ng winter followed by movements of short-to-moderate distances to reach higher elevation ranges during summer (Knowlton 1960, Ritchie 1978, Pierce and Peek 1984, Kufeld and Bowden 1996). Several studies have described the im portance of shrub-dominated habitats during winter (Knowlton 1960, Stevens 1970, Van Dyke et al. 1995, Kufeld and Bowden 1996) with a shift to closed-canopy coniferous forests during late winter (Houston 1968, Ritchie 1978, Matchet 1985, Tyers and Irby 1995). Where ri parian habitats were limited, the use of mature coniferous forests that provid e abundant cover and forage throughout winter were found to be most important (Peek 1974, Pierce 1984, Pierce and Peek 1984). Browse and forbs appeared to dominate summer diets of Shiras moose (Knowlton 1960, Houston 1968, Stevens 1970, Ritchie 1978), but matu re coniferous forests, particularly lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta ), that do not necessarily pr ovide an abundance of forage have been described as an important component of summer habitats (Ritchie 1978, Kufeld and Bowden 1996). This study was initiated because declini ng indices of population density and calf- cow ratios suggested a downward trend in Shiras moose numbers in northwest Wyoming. Moose declines have been most evident in the Buffalo Valley, approximately 50 km 13 north of the town of Jackson, Wyomi ng (B rimeyer and Thomas 2004). Therefore, the goal of this research was to describe s easonal movements, distribution, and habitat selection patterns of adult female Shiras moose captured in the Buffalo Valley. By examining and contrasting Shiras moose ha bitat use both within and across seasons, I intended to identify potential limiting factors. My specific objectives were to: (1) estimate the dates of winter and summer seas onal range use and the onset of spring and fall migration; (2) describe seasonal sp ace-use patterns including home range size, fidelity, and distances moved; and (3) determine habitat and landscape features that are important predictors of winter and summer habitat selection. Using these data, I mapped population-level predictions of seasonal habitat selection across the winter and summer study area to provide managers with info rmation on important seasonal ranges and to assist with future la nd-use decisions. STUDY AREA The study area encompassed approximately 6,400 km2 of predominately public land in northwest Wyoming. It was north of the town of Jackson, Wyoming and included portions of Grand Teton National Park (GTN P), Yellowstone National Park (YNP), and the Bridger-Teton National Forest (BTNF) where elevations ranged from 1,866 to 4,197 m. The study area included the upper Snake River and upper Yellowstone River watersheds. Primary moose winter ranges and major tributaries of the Snake River consisted of Pacific Creek, the Buffalo Fork River, and the Gros Ventre River (Houston 1968). 14 Vegetation types varied with elevation a nd aspect within the study area (Whitlock 1993, Knight 1994). Lower elevations, a nd ma ny south-facing slopes at higher elevations, were dominated by sagebrush ( Artemisia spp.). Mid-elevations were characterized by large stands of lodgepol e pine intermixed with Douglas fir Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and lodgepole ), and aspen dominated higher elevations. Al pine tundra occurred at the hi ghest elevations while open forest parks and subalpine mea dows occurred at all elevationa l gradients. Riparian located in large, relatively flat flooplain environments at lower elevations and along nearly all drainages within the study area (Wigglesworth and Wachob 2004). The climate was characterized by short, cool summers and long, cold winters. From 1975-2004, annual precipitation averaged 56 cm (range = 38-79 cm) of which approximately 65% fell as snow between November and May (http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/ cgi-bin/Timeseries/timeseries1.pl; accessed 16 October 2005). The Teton Mountains to the west and the northern highlands along the southern boundary of YNP typically receive the greatest amounts of precip itation (Houston 1968, Cole 1969, Boyce 1989). 15 METHODS Moose Captures and Data Management Adult ( 2 years) female moose were capture d using a helicopter on winter range in the Buffalo Valley of northwest Wyom ing during February 2005 and 2006. Moose were darted and immobilized with 10 -mg thiafentanil oxalate (A-3080, Wildlife Pharmaceuticals, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA: McJames et al. 1994, Arnemo et al. 2003, Kreeger et al. 2005) and, once handling wa s completed, thiafentanil was antagonized with 300-mg naltrexone (Trexoni l, Wildlife Pharmaceuticals, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA) administered intramuscularly at multiple sites. Captures were performed in accordance with approved University of Wyoming Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. Moose were fitted with TGW-3700 global pos itioning system (GPS) collars with store-on-board technology and mortality sensing options (Telonics, Inc., Mesa, Arizona, USA). Collars were preprogrammed to attempt a location fix every hour from 15 November to 15 June and every 5 hours from 16 June to 14 November. Location data were collected continuously until 1 March 2007 when the collars were preprogrammed to release from the moose. Location data we re examined and all unsuccessful fixes and obvious location errors were removed from datasets (D'Eon et al. 2002, D'Eon and Serrouya 2005). Data were not corrected for fi x-rate bias because of high fix-rate success during winter (99.1%) and summer (96.2%, A ppendix 2.1; D'Eon 2003, Friar et al. 2004, Hebblewhite et al. 2007). Three-dimensi onal fixes accounted for a high proportion of winter (83.0%) and summer (60.6%) locations (Appendix 2.2), therefore, data were not 16 differentially corrected because 3-dime nsiona l locations generally have < 20 m error (Di Orio et al. 2003). Seasonal Home Range Characteristics Due to variability among individuals in the onset of moveme nts between seasonal ranges, I visually examined the spatial and temporal distribution of location data for individual moose in ArcGIS 9.2 (Environmen tal Systems Research Institute, Redlands, California, USA) to identify dates and times of seasonal range us e (Nikula et al. 2004, D'Eon and Serrouya 2005). Moose were assume d to have left a seasonal range when the distance between sequen tial relocations increased and the direction of travel suggested movement away from a cluster of locations without returning. Similarly, when the distance between relocations decreased and locations began to cluster, moose were assumed to have arrived at a seasonal range. All locations that occurred outside of these parameters were classified as migration. Based on these assumptions, I identified seasons of use as winter and summer. If I was unable to estimate movement dates for an individual, I plotted the location data in ArcGIS and examined th e number of moose whose seasonal ranges overlapped the location data. I then calculated the mean dates of use for all moose that overlapped the location data and used this as the date of seas onal range use for the individual moose of interest. This was ba sed on the assumption that dates of seasonal range use were comparable among individual m oose that utilized similar seasonal ranges during the same year. For moose that arrived on summer range prior to 16 June and left after 14 November, every fifth location was re tained prior to and after these dates to maintain a constant fix schedule during summer. I used a Kruskal-Wallis one-way 17 ANOVA to test for among year differences ( = 0.05) in seasonal range arrival and departure dates. Due to the topographic relief of the st udy area and the number of locations obtained from the GPS collars, I used the fixed- k local convex hull (LoCoH) method to estimate home range size for each moose duri ng each season because it does not require statistically independent locat ion data (Getz and Wilmers 20 04, Ryan et al. 2006). This method creates hulls around each location and its k nearest neighbors then constructs isopleths by merging these polygons together , beginning with the smallest and ending with the largest (Get z and Wilmers 2004, Ryan et al . 2006). To begin, values of k at the 100% isopleth were run in increments of 5 that encompassed the square root of the number of locations for each moose and season. I plotted area estimates against k to locate the point at which home range size plateaued (Ryan et al. 2006). Values of k were then run in increments of 1 to determine the best k value, area estimates were plotted, and shapefiles were created to view the results . To obtain more accurate and unbiased estimates of home range size, 90% LoCoH isopl eths were calculated for selected values of k for moose during each season (B\u00f6rger et al. 2006, Elwen et al. 2006). I used a Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA to te st for among year differences ( = 0.05) in winter and summer home range sizes and if diffe rences were not observed, I pooled annual winter and summer home range sizes, respectively, to test for seasonal differences. If individual moose were monitored during multiple years, home range estimates were averaged to provide a single estimate for each individual prior to testing for seasonal differences. 18 To estimate the extent of fi delity to seas onal home ranges, I calculated the percent overlap between seasonal ranges for adult female moose that were monitored for 2 consecutive years. Seasonal 90% LoCoH home range polygons were mapped and the total area of overlap for each moose and seas on was calculated in ArcGIS. The total area of overlap was then divided by the total area encompassed by the 2 seasonal ranges (Scarpitti et al. 2005). To determine the mi gratory status of ra dio-collared moose, I estimated overlap between winter and summer ranges within the same year. If < 50% overlap occurred, the moose was considered migratory (MacCracken et al. 1997). For individuals that were considered migratory, I measured the straight-line distance between the mean centers of winter and summer ranges within years. I tested for annual differences ( = 0.05) in home range overlap within seasons and straight-line distance moved between seasonal ranges with a Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA. All 90% LoCoH summer home range polygons were mapped in ArcGIS and if they overlapped at any point, this area was classified as a moose summer range complex. Migration routes were delinea ted by mapping all transition locations for each moose in ArcGIS and tracing the routes taken from winter to summer range, and back, in both years. To examine the relationship between onset of spring and autumn migration and the elevation of moose summer ranges, I extr acted summer elevation data for each moose from a 26 x 26-m digital elevation model (DEM ; U.S. Geological Survey [USGS] 1999). I used Spearman rank correlation ( = 0.05) to determine if a relationship existed between the onset of spring and autumn migration and the elevation of summer ranges. 19 Seasonal Habitat Selection Modeling procedures to estimate resource selection probability functions (RSPF; Manly et al. 2002) followed those ou tlined by Sawyer et al. (2006) and consisted of 4 basic steps: (1) estimate the relative freque ncy of use for each G PS-collared moose from a large number of sampling units for each season and year, (2) use the relative frequency as a continuous response variable in a multiple regression analysis (i.e., generalized linear model) that was assumed to have a negativ e binomial distribution (White and Bennetts 1996) to model the probability of use for each moose as a function of a set of predictor variables, (3) develop a popul ation-level model by averaging the coefficient estimates from the individual moose models for each season, and (4) map the predictions of the population-level model for each season. Individual GPS-collared moose were treated as the experimental unit to avoid spatial and temporal autocorrel ation (Aebischer et al. 1993, Otis and White 1999, Millspaugh et al. 2006). I used the distribution of radio-collared moose from 2005 to 2007 to define winter and summer habitat availability (McClean et al. 1998) by creating a minimum convex polygon around all moose locations for each season using the HOME RANGE TOOLS extension for ArcGIS (Rodgers et al. 2007) . I buffered the winter and summer study areas by the average daily distance moved per season (winter = 1,450 m, summer = 1,680 m; Appendix 2.3) to include wh at could potentially be ava ilable to moose within one day's travel. I created a single vegetation layer from 2 existing layers (Homer 1998, Cogan et al. 2005) and reclassi fied vegetation data into 6 classes: (1) spruce/fir, (2) (3) mixed/other conifer, (4) as pen, (5) riparian/dec iduous shrub, or (6) burn/other. Since the vegetation layers did not contain canopy height or percent cover 20 information, I could not estimate canopy height for deciduous shrubs. Therefore, to assess hab itat types that coul d potentially provide thermal cover for moose, cover was defined strictly as conifers in winter and conifers and aspen habitats in summer. I used the SPATIAL ANALYST extension for ArcGIS to estimate distance to cover for each season and to calculate slope (i.e., degrees ) and aspect from a 26 x 26-m DEM (USGS 1999). I created circular sample units with 125-m radii that were systematically distributed with a random start across each study area to measure 11 variables that could potentially influence winter and summer ha bitat selection. These included the 6 vegetation classes listed above, elevation, slope, aspect, dist ance to cover, and habitat diversity. I chose 125-m radii circular samplin g units because this was approximately the average distance moved by moose in a 2-hour period during both wi nter and summer. This ensured that the area of the sample unit was small enough to detect changes in animal movement, but large enough to obtain multiple locations with in each unit (Sawyer et al. 2006). I extracted ve getation data from each sample unit and calculated the proportion of each vegetation type that occu rred within each unit. Elevation, slope, aspect, and distance to cover were obtained fr om the midpoint of each sample unit. It has been demonstrated that moose select for habitat diversity at a larger spatial scale (Hjelford et al. 1990, Nikula et al. 2004). Thus, I created 250-m-radii circular units centered on the midpoint of each sample unit, extracted vegetation data from each unit, and calculated a Shannon-Weiner diversity inde x (Krebs 1989) based on the 6 vegetation classes listed above. 21 To estimate the relative frequency of use for each moose, I counted the number of individual moose locations within each samp le unit across the seas onal study areas during each year. Prior to m odeling, and to ensure independence of the sample units (Thompson 1992:51), I took a random sample with replacement of approximately 6,000 sample units for winter and 20,000 sample units for summer . I used a forward stepwise modeling procedure to estimate population-level models for each season and used a t-statistic to determine variable entry ( 0.15) and exit ( 0.20; Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000). I considered quadratic terms for slope duri ng winter and elevation and slope during summer. If a quadratic term entered the mode l then the linear form of each variable was included. Aspect was considered as a categorical variable with the northeast aspect as the reference and if one of the aspect categories (i.e., northwest, south east, and southwest) was significant ( 0.15) all of the categories were included. The burn/other vegetation category was not fitted during the model building process for any season because inference as to selection or avoidance woul d be difficult to ascertain due to the many different vegetation types that were included in this class. This ensured independence of the vegetation classes and did not violate the unit-sum constr aint (Aebischer et al. 1993, Nikula A Pearson' s pairwise correlation anal ysis was conducted prior to modeling to identify multicolin earities and to identify any pr edictor variables that should be excluded from analysis ( r > 0.60). Population-level models were developed for each season and year. I used a Spearman's rank correlation analysis ( = 0.05) to determine if a significant relationship existed in predicted RSPF values between years for all sample units within each seasonal study area. If no differences were observed, all moose locations were pooled across years for each season and a single winter and summer 22 population-level model was developed using th e same techniques described above. All habitat m odeling procedures were conducted us ing the R statistical software package (R Core Development Team 2006). I mapped RSPF predictions of population- level models across 130 x 130-m pixels for winter and 250 x 250-m pixels for summer that covered each seasonal study area. The RSPF values were assigned values from 1 to 5 representing highest to lowest estimated use probabilities in 20% increments (i.e., highest predicted probability of use = 1 [highest 20%], lowest predicted probability of use = 5 [lowest 20%]; Sawyer et al. 2006, Sawyer et al. 2007). RESULTS Moose Captures and Data Management Twenty adult female moose were capt ured in February 2005 and 6 additional moose were captured in February 2006. Two GPS collars malfunctioned during this study. One collar partially failed in summer 2005 and averaged < 60% fix-rate success during the remaining seasons. The other par tially failed during winter 2006 and again in winter 2007. These collars were removed from all analyses for the seasons they failed except when estimating the dates of seasonal movements. Seasonal Movements and Home Range Characteristics Movements between seasonal ranges were identifiable for most moose in both years. I was, however, unable to identify tr ansition from winter to summer range for 3 23 moose and transition from summer to winter range for 1 moose, thus the m ean dates from moose whose summer ranges overlapped these in dividuals were used to estimate the end of one season and the beginning of the next (Appendix 2.4). Although spring migration began approximately 2 weeks earlier in 2005 ( x = 8 May \u00b1 4.6 days; n = 17) than in 2006 ( x = 20 May \u00b1 4.3 days; n = 20), no statistical diffe rence was observed between years ( P = 0.094). No significant diffe rence was observed between 2005 ( x = 18 November 3.7 days, n = 17) and 2006 ( \u00b1 x = 22 November \u00b1 3.9 days, n = 19) in the onset of fall migration ( P = 0.557). Winter home range sizes were estimate d for all moose (Appendix 2.5); however, only those moose that successfully left winter range in 2005 ( n = 17), had a full winter of data in 2006 ( n = 12), or successfully remained on wi nter range until collars dropped or were removed during capture efforts in 2007 ( n = 18) were used to examine annual differences. Mean winter home range size was 4.0 0.5 km\u00b12 in 2005, 5.5 0.9 km\u00b12 in 2006, and 2.9 0.5 km\u00b12 in 2007 (Figure 2.1). There were no differences in winter home range sizes between 2005 and 2006 ( P = 0.268), but differences were observed when 2007 was compared to 2005 ( P = 0.027) and 2006 ( P = 0.014). Therefore, only winter home range sizes from 2005 and 2006 were used for remaining winter home range comparisons. Total mean winter home range size was 4.5 0.5 km\u00b12 (n = 17, x relocations = 2,720, k = 62). Summer home range estimates were calculated for all moose that had functional collars while on summer range in 2005 ( n = 16) and 2006 ( n = 19). Mean summer home range size was 11.9 1.8 km\u00b12 in 2005 and 13.4 \u00b1 2.1 km2 in 2006 (Figure 2.1). No difference was observed between years ( P = 0.843). Total mean summer home range size 24 was 13.2 1.9 km\u00b12 (n = 22, x relocations = 814, k = 38). When years were pooled, mean summer home range size was significantly greater than mean winter home range size ( P < 0.001). There was a significant difference ( P < 0.001) between percent winter ( n = 12, x = 21.5 0.03%) and summer home range overlap ( n = 13, \u00b1 x = 44.5 \u00b1 0.03%). All adult female moose were considered migratory in 2005 ( n = 16) and 2006 ( n = 18). Only 2 moose had overlapping winter and summer ra nges (1 in both years) and the greatest percent overlap observed for an individual m oose within a year was 2.9%. There was no significant difference ( P = 0.352) in the distance traveled between seasonal ranges in 2005 ( x = 19.8 \u00b1 3.4 km, range = 3.1-38.3 km) and 2006 ( x = 23.1 \u00b1 3.1 km, range = 3.8-44.0 km). Seasonal movement patterns involved a general congregation on low elevation winter ranges followed by indi vidual migrations to more dispersed, high elevation summer ranges. All moose traveled along mi gration routes that paralleled primary drainages or crossed low elevation passes th roughout the study area and used the same general routes during spring and autumn (Fi gure 2.2). Moose that were monitored during migrations in 2005 and 2006 ( n = 12) used similar routes in both years. Most collared adult female moose occupied 1 of 4 summer range complexes while 3 individuals occupied an area where no other collared moose traveled (Figure 2.2). When the elevations of individual moos e summer ranges were regresse d against the onset of spring migration, a positive relationship existed, but th is correlation was only significant in 2006 (rs = 0.728, P < 0.001, Figure 2.3). In general, th e onset of fall migration and the 25 elevations of summer ranges were negatively correlated, however, no significant relationship was observe d in either year ( P > 0.05). Habitat Selection Winter Based on movements and distributions of GPS-collared adult female moose during the winters of 2005 to 2007, the winter study area encompassed approximately 1,100 km2 (Figure 2.4). Population-level habitat selection models were developed for each winter period using 36,485 relocations in 2005 ( n = 17 moose), 67,160 relocations in 2006 ( n = 21 moose), and 35,977 relocations in 2007 ( n = 18 moose). Moose selected winter habitats with a high proportion of riparian/d eciduous shrub vegetation, low elevation, high habitat diversit y, and near coniferous cover in all years (Appendix 2.6). Moose selected moderate slopes in 2006 a nd 2007 and avoided northerly aspects in 2005 and 2007. Mixed conifer was avoided in 2006 and 2007 and spruce/fir was avoided in 2007. In 2007, most moose avoided spruce/fir (1 0 of 18) and mixed conifer (16 of 18). However, individual model coefficients were < -700 for 4 moose a nd < -800 for 2 moose for the spruce/fir and mixed conifer vegetation classes, respectively, due to a lack of these vegetation types within indivi dual moose winter home ranges. When the coefficients were averaged for the population-level model, estimates for spruce/fir and mixed conifer were not indicative of population-level habi tat selection for the GPS-collared sample (spruce/fir = -169, mixed conifer = -101), thus they were removed from the final model (Appendix 2.6). The model was rerun for 2007 a nd no other variables en tered the model. Although each winter model contained differe nt combinations of covariates (Appendix 26 2.6), the predicted RSPF values for each sample unit were similar between 2005 and 2006 (r s = 0.839, P < 0.001), 2005 and 2007 (r s = 0.791, P < 0.001), and 2006 and 2007 (rs = 0.823, P < 0.001). Since differences were not observed in the predicted RSPF values among years, all winter relocations were pooled to create a single popul ation-level winter habitat selection model and predictive map of the probability of use. The final pooled model included riparian/deciduous shrub, aspen, and mixed conifer vegetation types, elevation, slope, habitat diversity, and di stance to coniferous cover (T able 2.1). Population-level model coefficients indicated that moose selected areas with a high proportion of riparian/deciduous shrub and aspen vegetati on, low elevation, high habitat diversity, moderate slopes, close to coniferous cover, and avoided mixed conifer forests (Table 2.1). Areas with the highest predicted proba bility of moose use we re 7% aspen, 6% spruce/fir, mixed conifer, had an average elevation of 2,114 m, slopes of 4\u00b0, and were approximately 151 m from coniferous cover. Predictive maps indicate that the highest probability of use occurred along relatively flat, low-eleva tion drainages dominated by riparian and deciduous shrub habitats interspersed with patches of conifer and aspen (Figure 2.5). Summer Based on movements and distributions of GPS-collared adult female moose during the summers of 2005 and 2006, the summer study area encompassed approximately 3,800 km2 (Figure 2.6). Popul ation-level habitat se lection models were developed for each summer using 13,781 relocations in 2005 ( n = 16 moose) and 14,915 27 relocations in 2006 ( n = 19 moose). Moose selected summer habitats composed of moderate elevations and slopes and avoided mi xed conifer forests and aspen in all years (Appendix 2.7). Spruce/fir was avoided in 2005 while lodgepole was avoided in 2006. In 2006, moose also selected summer habita ts that offered high habitat diversity, northerly aspects, and were relatively close to cover provided by aspen and conifers. Although the summer 2006 model contained 5 additional covariates (Appendix 2.7), the predicted RSPF values for each sample unit within the summer study area were similar between years (r s = 0.924, P < 0.001). Since differences were not observed in the predicted RSPF values among years, all summer relocations were pooled to cr eate a single population-level summer habitat selection model and predicted probability of use map. The final model included, in the order that they entered, elevat ion, slope, distance to cover, and lodgepole, mixed conifer, and aspen vegetation types (Table 2.1). P opulation-level model coefficients indicated that moose selected areas of moderate elev ation and slope, close to cover, and avoided lodgepole, mixed conifers, and aspen (Table 2.1). Areas with the highest predicted probability of moose use were composed of 24% shrub, 7% aspen, and mi xed conifer, had an average elevation of 2,438 m, slopes of 9\u00b0, and were approximately 49 m from cover. Predictive maps indicated that the highest probability of m oose use during summer occurred at mid- elevation habitats that were close to cover with relatively flat slopes (Figure 2.7). The low-elevation ranges classified as high or me dium-high probabilities of use during winter were classified as low or medium-low probabilities of use during summer. 28 DISCUSSION Population-level habitat selection models suggested that adult fem ale moose in the study area selected for lo w-elevation, riparian habitats dominated by extensive willow communities during winter. Throughout their distribution moose generally seek winter habitats that provide abunda nt forage (Peek 1997, M\u00e5nsson et al. 2007). The extensive use of shrub-dominated habitats during wint er has been well documented for moose in Alaska (Mould 1979, Hundertmark et al . 1990, MacCracken et al. 1997) and the Intermountain West (Knowlton 1960, Van Dyke et al. 1995, Kufeld and Bowden 1996). Furthermore, past diet and forage studie s conducted on Shiras moose in the Greater Yellowstone Area demonstrated the historical preference of willow as winter forage (Rudersdorf 1952, McMillan 1953, Harry, 1957, Houst on 1968). Where riparian habitats are less extensive, the use of mature conifer ous forests that contain a high diversity of forage species becomes important (Stevens 1970, Pierce and Peek 1984, Matchett 1985, Tyers 2003). Shrub-dominated, riparian habitats provide the greatest abundance of available forage within the study area during the most restrictiv e time of year. Therefore, these habitats likely reduce the energetic demands of travelin g through snow in search of forage and allow moose the opportunity to reduce the negative energy balance typically incurred during winter. Although moose selected areas dominated by riparian shrubs, they did not select homogenous stands of willows. Adult female moose selected areas with high habitat diversity which suggests that they require a variety of resour ces to meet their nutritional and energetic requirements during winter. Thes e findings are consistent with results from an experimental study that demonstrated moose selection for a diverse diet even when 29 preferred forage species were highly availabl e (Miquelle and Jordan 1979). On the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, Oldeme yer et al. (1977) suggested that succession from multi-species to single-species dominated winter range may have contributed to an increased incidence of mortalities associat ed with malnourishment. Browse quality is generally lower during winter than during summer (Regelin et al . 1987, MacCracken et al. 1997, Schwartz and Renecker 1997); therefore, a variety of resources can better meet the nutritional requirements of moose than a single, highl y abundant species (Oldemeyer et al. 1977, Ohlson and Staaland 2001). When browse dige stibility, fiber content, protein content, and mineral content were examined among fora ge species in Alaska, aspen ranked as the highest quality winter browse while willows we re intermediate (Oldemeyer et al. 1977). Although browse quality may va ry by region, selection by adu lt female moose for aspen habitats in the study area indi cated that moose not only pref erred areas with high browse biomass, but they also selected the highest quality browse availabl e during winter. Based on my results, there is little evidence to support a shift to habitats with greater canopy cover during late winter even though distance to c over entered the final population-level model. The model devel oped for winter 2005 could have been interpreted as late winter habitat selection sin ce monitoring was conducted from February 2005 until individual moose left the winter ra nge that year. Adult female moose did select habitats closer to coniferous cover in 2005 ( x = 95 m) than in 2006 ( x = 130 m) or 2007 ( x = 169 m). However, there were no di fferences in predicted RSPF values among winters suggesting that habitat use was similar for late winter (i.e., 2005), full winter (i.e., 2006), and ea rly winter (i.e., 2007). This indicated that forage availability was more important than cover during the en tire winter over the range of conditions 30 observed during this study. Similar resu lts have been described for moose in southeastern British Columbia, Canada (Poole and Stuart-Smith 2006) and in east-central Idaho (Ritchie 1978). This contrasts with other studies where shifts to closed-canopy coniferous forests were observed during late winter due to increased snow accumulations in Alaska (Hundertmark et al. 1990, Balla rd et al. 1991, MacCracken et al. 1997, Stephenson et al. 2006), Minnesota (Philip s et al. 1973, Peek et al. 1976), Montana (Stevens 1970, Matchett 1985), and Wyoming (Houston 1968). Winter range conditions may not have been severe enough during my study to necessitate selection for coniferous habitats (Poole and Stuart-Smith 2006). Additionally, moose may have utilized tracks of other individuals to reduce the energetic costs of locomotion rather than seeking areas of reduced snow depths under closed-canopy fore sts (LeSage et al. 2000, Ball et al. 2001). Although conifers appeared to be of minor importance to moose in the study area, the cover that these habitats provide may be impor tant for short periods during the winter. This could especially be true during late winter and early spring when rising ambient temperatures increase thermal stress (Ren ecker and Hudson 1986, Schwab and Pitt 1991). In winter, moose experience heat stress at -5\u00b0C (Renecker and Hudson 1986, Schwartz and Renecker 1997) and generally avoid area s where this threshold is exceeded for extended periods of time (Schwab and Pitt 1991). Thus, during late winter and early spring, moose in the study area may have utili zed coniferous habitats during the warmest parts of the day and returned to more ope n habitats as temperatures cooled. Summer habitat selection by adult female moose appeared to be associated with habitat and landscape features that may reduce the effects of thermal stress. All moose migrated to higher elevation summer ranges a nd selected for areas in close proximity to 31 cover provided by aspens and conifers. Areas classified as high-use during summer were > 300 m higher in elevation and were > 100 m closer to cover than high-use areas in winter. In northwest Wyoming, Dirks and Martner (1982) reported a cooling rate of 9.8\u00b0C per 1,000 m gain in elevation, thus hi gh-use summer areas were on average 3.2\u00b0C cooler than if moose had remained on lo w-elevation, high-use wi nter ranges during summer. During summer, moose experience heat stress at 14\u00b0C (Schwartz and Renecker 1997) and it has been suggested that regi ons with temperatures > 27\u00b0C for extended periods of time are unsuitable for moose unless there are refugia to provide relief (Kelsall and Telfer 1974). Maximum daily temperat ures recorded at the Two Ocean Plateau SnoTel station in the middle of the summer study area (elevation = 2,816 m; approximately 400 m higher than the mean el evation of predicted high-use summer areas) indicated that summer temperatures routinely exceeded the 14\u00b0C heat stress threshold, and were very near the upper threshold limit for extended periods of time during the summers of 2005 and 2006 (http://www. wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snotel/Wyoming/ wyoming.html). Therefore, selection for hab itats in close proximity to cover may have provided relief from high summer temperatures. This is similar to other research that documented the increased use of closed-canopy forests by moose as summer temperatures rose (Schwab and Pitt 1991, Du ssault et al. 2004, Muir 2006). It has also been reported that moose increased nocturna l activity (Dussault et al. 2004) and were more likely to be located in open shrub fi elds during crepuscular hours in response to increased temperatures (Muir 2006). In north-central Colorado, researchers suggested that lower growth forms of willow at higher el evations provided little cover, thus moose utilized coniferous cover in close proximity to preferred deciduous sh rub habitats (Kufeld 32 and Bowden 1996). Although my study cannot prove that mature coniferous forests are critical for moose survival during summ er (Balsom et al. 1996), it does lend support for the importance of these habitats in providing co ver that could reduce he at stress near the southern extent of their range. Summer habitats that are closer to co ver could provide females tending calves increased protection from predators. It has been documented that parturient female moose seek calving locations th at provide greater hiding co ver during the neonate phase (Langley and Pletscher 1994, Bowyer et al. 1999, Poole an d Stuart-Smith 2007), while only recently has it been reported that fema les tending calves select habitats that may reduce predation risk during the entire summer (Dussault et al. 2005 b). While this may have influenced habitat selection for some individuals in the study area, most adult female moose that were fitted with GPS collars were not observed with calves in 2005 or 2006 (Chapter 4). Thus, predation risk likely had little to no effect on the summer habitat selection patterns for the study animals and lends further support for the importance of cover in reducing thermal stress. The summer habitat selection patterns by m oose likely reflect a release from the environmental constraints of deep snow that restrict habitat se lection during winter (Dussault et al. 2005 a, Stephenson et al. 2006). Summer home range sizes were greater than winter and no specific vegetation types were selected for during summer. Habitat diversity did not enter the summer model wh ich suggested that moose were not limited by the availability of forage and could be more selective in their summer habitat use patterns. This is supported by research conducted in Quebec Province, Canada that reported a negative relationship between moose home range size and forage availability 33 in winter, but not during summer (Dussault et al. 2005 a). When resources are widely distributed and highly available, as they are during summer, moose may seek out patches of the highest quality forage within their home ranges and not necessarily use areas that contain the greatest abundance of forage. Due to differences in elevation, slope, and aspect, changes in plant phenology could have also influenced the choices of feeding sites and habitats used by moose (Hjelford et al. 1990, Mysterud et al. 2001). For example, several researchers have documented high use of forbs by Shiras moose, especially in late spring and early summer even though browse remained a staple of the diet (McMillan 1953, Harry 1957, Knowlton 1960, Houston 1968, St evens 1970, Ritchie 1978). It is possible that moose used habitat patches w ithin different vegetation classes to take advantage of changes in the quality of forage throughout the summer (Peek 1997). Additionally, summer provided moose with many forage choices resulting in a high level of individual variation in habitat selection pattern s across the summer range. Fidelity to seasonal home ranges may also be influenced by habitat diversity and the spatial distribution of pr eferred habitat patches. Adult female moose exhibited greater fidelity to larger summer home range s than to smaller winter home ranges. Higher fidelity to summer home ranges have also been observed in Alaska (MacCracken et al. 1997), New Hampshire (Scarpitti et al. 2005), and Sweden (Andersen 1991 a). Preferred riparian habitats occur throughout the Buffalo Valley winter range, thus specific knowledge of preferre d, high quality habitat patche s may not be needed because wherever moose move, they are likely to enc ounter sufficient forage of similar nutritional value. In contrast, summer range resour ces are highly availabl e, but the spatial distribution of heterogeneous patches of high quality forage may be more widely 34 dispersed. Over time, moose may have lear ned where specific patches of high quality resourc es were located within their summer home ranges resulting in greater fidelity as they frequently visited preferred patches (Forester et al. 2007). Spring and autumn migrations are in fluenced by a combination of snow conditions and the availability of fo rage (Edwards and Ritcey 1957, Coady 1974, LeResche 1974). If elevation was used as a surrogate for snow depth (Poole and Stuart- Smith 2006), moose with higher elevati on summer ranges generally began spring migration later, but this relationship was onl y significant in 2006. During the winter of 2006, snow accumulations were greater and persisted longer into the spring than in 2005 (http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/snotel/Wyoming/wyoming.html; accessed 16 November 2007). This suggested that after winters with high snow accumulations, spring migrations were highly influen ced by snow conditions and the effects this might have in delaying spring green-up, whereas after wint ers with relatively low snow accumulations, moose may use some other fact or to initiate movement. The lack of a relationship between the onset of autumn migration and el evation implies that a rapid accumulation of snow on summer range initiated the return to winter range for all moose regardless of where they summered (Ballard et al. 1991, DeMarchi 2003). While the timing of movements between seasonal ranges appeared to be influenced by snow, adult female moose exhi bited a high degree of individual variability in the onset of spring and autumn migrations. This is sim ilar to research conducted in Alaska (Ballard et al. 1991) and Minnesota (Philips et al . 1973). The variation in movements may be due to the energetic de mands of the animals following winters of differing severity. Mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) research in Colorado suggested that 35 improved physical condition following mild winters allowed for earlier mi gration to summer ranges (Garrott et al. 1987). Nonetheless, a more comprehensive understanding of the timing of seasonal movements and th e physical condition of moose prior to migration is needed. As with application of most modeling pro cedures to biological data, there were potential weaknesses in the methodology used. Since annual habita t selection models were combined into a single model for each season, some potential for pseudoreplication was introduced because some moose were used to build habitat selection models during all seasons. However, I concluded that the potential for introduc ing bias was minimal (Oksanen 2001) and that this was the best modeling procedure for the data available. A second area of potential weakness was that all of the available data was used in the modeling procedure in order to produce seas onal models with th e highest predictive power possible, thus I was unabl e to independently validate th e model. In the future, I would strongly suggest model validation using independent data in order to verify the predictions of moose habitat se lection in northwest Wyoming. MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS Summer and winter ranges may be e qually important components of moose habitat in northwest Wyoming. Managers ca nnot assume the relative importance of one seasonal range over the other be cause both are integrally lin ked into the dynamics of populations. Migration routes are also important components of year-round ranges because access to seasonal ranges would be li mited without these and it is unlikely that 36 current population levels could be maintained (Sawyer et al. 2005). Migrations between seasonal rang es generally follow traditional routes and this knowledge is passed from parent to offspring (Sweanor and Sandegren 1988, Andersen 1991 b), thus it may take several generations for moose to adapt to habitat alterations that impact seasonal movements and the quality of seasonal ranges. Shiras moose in the study area selected for winter habitats that provided the greatest abundance of, and potentially the highest quality, forage. However, the importance of habitat diversity that include s cover provided by coniferous forests cannot be underestimated, especially during spring when increasing ambient temperatures may limit the foraging activities of moose during th e day. Since moose are more concentrated on winter range, habitat improvements could benefit many more individuals, but these projects should not focus strictly on willow- dominated riparian co mmunities. This study suggested that managing for a variety of ha bitats within the wi nter range may allow moose to better meet their nutri tional and cover requirements. Shiras moose summer range appears to be highly influenced by habitat and landscape features that limit thermal stress while still securing adequate amounts of high quality forage. Moose are more disperse d on summer ranges and large-scale habitat improvement projects would be impractical. Additionally, most of the summer ranges are relatively protected from hu man disturbance because much of the area is managed as wilderness by the Bridger-Teton National Forest, Grand Teton National Park, or Yellowstone National Park. However, natu ral disturbances that can impact moose summer ranges have occurred in northwest Wy oming. Tyers (2003) suggested that the 1988 Yellowstone wildfires were detrimenta l to moose on the Northern Yellowstone 37 winter range because they removed a large port ion of m ature coniferous forests. Large- scale wildfires or insect infestations that reduce the amount of mature forests could reduce the physical condition of moose entering winter (Saether 1985, Solberg et al. 1999, Solberg et al. 2004) and may have a detr imental effect on moose populations in the future. A reduction in physic al condition could also make moose more susceptible to diseases and parasitic infections by reduci ng reproductive output and adult survival (Murray et al. 2006). My study was not designed to test how a reduction in the amount of mature coniferous forests may result in populat ion declines (Chapter 1), but indices of moose population density and calf-cow ratios for the north Jackson moose herd suggested the declines began shortly after the 1988 Ye llowstone fires. Therefore, due to the continued threat of wildfire and the increased threat of insect infestations that may alter the availability and quality of moose summer ranges through direct destruction of mature coniferous forests, increased monitoring of the availability of mature forests appears warranted. If large-scale habitat alterations occur, moose populations may be negatively impacted and harvest strategies and herd unit objectives may need to be adjusted accordingly. 38 LITERATURE CITED Aebischer, N.

This approach assumes that because an animal is a product of its environment, it will likely reflect the quality of its environment. Early work focused on the use of hematological and serum chemical parameters to assess differences in habitat quality among populations of pronghorn ( Antilocapra americana ; Seal and Hoskinson 1978), white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ; Seal et al. 1978), and elk ( Cervus elaphus ; Weber et al. 1984). Franzmann and LeRe sche (1978) expanded this concept by evaluating blood parameters in relation to indices of physical condition for Alaskan moose ( Alces alces gigas ). This provided a set of baseline data that could be used for comparative purposes to assess population c ondition and, thus, habitat quality and potential reproductive performance (Fra nzmann and Schwartz 1985, Stephenson 2003). Packed cell volume (PCV) was the single best predictor of body condition in moose, followed by hemoglobin (Hb), total serum pr (Ca), and phosphorous (P; Franzmann and LeResche 1978). These blood parameters identified populations on the extremes (i.e., very good or very poor condi tion), but were less effective when used to compare populations in moderate condition (F ranzm ann et al. 1987). More recently, the value of using TSP, Ca, and P has come in to question (Keech et al. 1998). Another technique has been developed to evalua te body condition and estimate total body fat using ultrasonography to measure rump fat de pth (Stephenson et al. 1993, Stephenson et al. 1998). The \"animal indicator concept\" has also b een applied to assessment of the nutrient quality of habitat because herbivores acquire minerals from the plants they consume (Franzmann 1985). Even if an animal appears to be in relatively good physical condition, nutritional deficiencies can create physiol ogical imbalances that may impact population performance (Combs 1987, Gogan et al. 1989). Free-ranging herbivores rarely acquire sufficient quantities of particular nutrients b ecause of high variability in forage mineral concentrations among sites and seasons (M cDowell 2003). The nutrient quality of browse used by moose is most limited duri ng winter (Kubota et al. 1970, Oldemeyer et al. 1977, Ohlson and Staaland 2001) and mineral concentrations in moose hair show similar temporal trends (Franzmann et al. 1974, Flynn et al. 1977, Stewart and Flynn 1978, Flynn and Franzmann 1987). Therefore, th e effects of nutritional deficiencies should be most apparent in wi nter. Mineral deficiencies can lead to reduced survival, especially among calves and yearlings, and re duced reproductive ou tput among domestic herbivores (WallisDeVries 1998). Clinical deficiencies have rarely been observed in moose populations because a redu ction in fitness often predisposes moose to other forms of mortality (O'Hara et al. 2001). Nonetheless, defici encies of trace elements, specifically Cu, have been suggested as a cau se of moose population declines in Alaska (Flynn et al. 1977, O'Hara et al. 2001), Sweden (Frank et al. 1994), and Minnesota 71(Custer et al. 2004). Furthermore, O'Hara et al. (2001) suggested that populations experiencing m arginal Cu deficiencies may not exhibit clinical symptoms unless additional stressful events occur. Indices of population density and calf-cow ratios sugge st a downward trend in Shiras moose ( A.a. shirasi ) numbers in northwest Wyoming. Potential factors contributing to the decline include a decrease in the quality of summer and winter habitat, increased predation by large carnivores, disease or parasites, or a combination of factors (Berger et al. 1999, Berger et al. 2001, Brimey er and Thomas 2004). Population declines have been most evident in the Buffalo Fork Valley, approximately 50 km north of the town of Jackson, Wyoming (Brimeyer and T homas 2004). To address the issues of habitat quality, disease, and para sites, I used the animal indi cator concept to investigate the physiological h ealth of adult ( 2 years) female Shiras moose in northwest Wyoming via a suite of physiological measurements that can be used to describe the nutritional status of the study population. Although Houston (1969) and Kreeger et al. (2005) have reported blood values for Shiras moose in Wyoming, few data were available from large samples collected over multiple years. Theref ore, this work provides baseline data that can be used to aid managers in future evaluation of the health of Shiras moose throughout the Intermountain West. My research objectiv es were to: (1) compare hematological and serum chemical parameters to baseline data from Alaskan moose, (2) measure maximum rump fat depth with ultrasonography to asse ss relative health compared to Alaskan moose, (3) examine macronutrient and micronut rient content of moose serum and hair and compare to reported deficiency values for domestic ruminants, (4) evaluate the presence of infectious diseases, and (5) a ssess endoparasite and ectoparasite loads. 72During this study, pregnant adult moose captured during winter experienced reduced parturition rates the following spring (Chapt er 4). Consequently, a sixth objective was established to exam ine the hypothesis that if moose are Cu deficient, a stressful event (i.e., capture) could induce perinatal mortality and in fluence reproductive success (O'Hara et al. 2001). STUDY AREA The study area encompassed approximately 6,400 km2 of predominately public land in northwest Wyoming. It included the upper Snake River and upper Yellowstone River watersheds and included portions of Grand Teton National Park (GTNP), Yellowstone National Park (YNP), and the Bridger-Teton National Forest (BTNF) where elevations ranged from 1,866 to 4,197 m. M oose wintered in low- elevation, riparian- dominated habitats along the Snake River and its primary tributarie s (i.e., Pacific Creek, Buffalo Fork River, Gros Ventre River; Chapter 2). During summer, migratory moose traveled to more dispersed, mid-elevation ranges (Chapter 2), whereas nonmigratory individuals remained on low-elev ation ranges (Houston 1968). Vegetation types varied with elevation and aspect (Whitlock 1993, Knight 1994). Lower elevations, and many south-facing slopes at higher elevations, were dominated by sagebrush ( Artemisia spp.). Mid-elevations slopes and more mesic sites. Engelmann 73spruce, subalpine fir, and l odgepole pine stands of whitebark dominated higher elevations. Alpine tundra o ccurred at the highest elevati ons while open forest parks and subalpine meadows occurred at all elevational gradients. Riparian areas were located in large, relatively flat floodplain environments at lower elevations and along nearly all drainages within the st udy area (Wigglesworth and Wachob 2004). The climate was characterized by short, cool summers and long, cold winters. From 1975-2004, annual precipitation averaged 56.2 cm (range = 37.9-79.1 cm) of which approximately 65% fell as snow between November and May (http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/ cgi-bin/Timeseries/ timeseries1.pl; accessed 16 October 2005). The Teton Mountains to the west and the northern highlands along the southern boundary of YNP typically received the greatest amounts of precip itation (Houston 1968, Cole 1969, Boyce 1989). METHODS Adult female moose were captured on wi nter range within the study area between January and March 2005, 2006, and 2007. Moos e were darted from the ground or a helicopter and immobilized with 10-mg thiafentan il oxalate (A-3080, Wildlife Pharmaceuticals Inc., Fort Collins, Colora do, USA; McJames et al. 1994, Arnemo et al. 2003, Kreeger et al. 2005) in 2005 and 2006 a nd 10-mg carfentanil (Wildnil, Wildlife Pharmaceuticals Inc., Fort Collins, Colorado, USA) in 2007. Immobilization drugs were delivered in a 1-ml dart (Pneu-dart, Willia msport, Pennsylvania, USA) fired from a CO 2- 74powered dart rifle (Dan-Inject North Ameri ca, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA) or a 0.22- caliber-b lank dart rifle (Model 193, Pneu-dar t, Williamsport, Pennsylvania, USA). Once handling was completed, thiafentanil and carfentanil were antagonized with an intramuscular injection of 300- mg naltrexone (Trexonil, Wild life Pharmaceuticals, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA; Kreeger et al. 2005) admi nistered at multiple sites. Techniques used to evaluate pregnancy and to determ ine the presence of a calf in spring were described in Chapter 4. Captures were performed in accordance with approved University of Wyoming Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. Once immobilized, moose were blindfolded and fitted with global positioning system (GPS; model TGW-3700, Telonics, Mesa , Arizona, USA) or very high frequency (VHF) radio transmitters (model M2710, Advanced Telemetry Systems, Isanti, Minnesota, USA). Numbered, aluminum ear tags were affixed to each ear. Body condition was subjectively evaluated and a score from 0 to 10 was assigned to each moose (Franzmann 1977). Depth of rump fa t was measured with an Omega I portable ultrasound unit (E.I. Medical, Loveland, Colorado, USA) in 2005 and a Bantam XLS portable ultrasound unit (E.I. Medical, Loveland, Colorado, USA) in 2006 and 2007 (Stephenson et al. 1993, Keech et al. 1998, Stephenson et al. 1998). Both ultrasound units used a 5-MHz 8-cm linear-array transd ucer and subcutaneous fat was measured with electronic calipers to the nearest 0.1 cm (Stephenson et al. 1998). Approximately 50-ml of blood was colle cted from each moose venipuncture for hematological analyses, serum chemical analyses, serum trace element screen, and bacterial and vira l serology. Hematological an alyses included whole blood concentrations of PCV, H b, mean corpuscular hemoglobi n content (MCHC), red blood 75cells (RBCs), total white blood cells (WBCs ), composition of white blood cells, and platelets. Serum chemical analyses included concentrations of album in (ALB), alkaline phosphate (ALP), aspartate and P. Levels of five micronutrients were analy zed with serum trace element screens and included Cu, iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), moly bdenum (Mb), and zinc (Zn). Blood was presence of antigens against Brucella abortus , Leptospira , arrhea virus, parainfl uenza-3 virus, and bovine respiratory syncytia l virus in 2005 while analys is was conducted for only B. abortus in 2006 and 2007. Fecal samples and ear sw abs were collected to evaluate endo- and ectoparasite loads. A 30-second tick count was performed along the dorsal midline posterior to the neck of each moose to assess the severity of winter tick ( Dermacantor albipictus ) infestations. Hair samples were collected from the dorsal midline between the shoulders and analyzed for concentrations of arsenic (As), barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co), Cu, Fe, lead (Pb), Mn, mercury (Hg), Mb, nickel (Ni), selenium (Se), thallium (Tl), vanadium (V), tin (Sn) and Zn. All diagnostic analyses were performed at the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory (Laramie, Wyoming, USA). Blood parameter (hematological and serum chemical) values and mineral concentrations (serum and hair macro- and micronutrients) were pooled within years and Table 3.1 was used to assess the nutritional status of the sampled populations based on published reference values. Mean values for PCV, Hb, TSP, Ca, and P were compared to 76baseline data from Alaskan moose that were co nsidered to be in average to above average condition (Franzm ann and LeResche 1978) a nd the proportion of the sampled population that were below these reported values was presented. Macro- and micronutrient requirements for moose have not been esta blished, so the propor tion of the sampled population that was deficient was calculated based on published deficiency thresholds for domestic ruminants (Puls 1994, McDowell 2003). The published reference values for Ca and Mg are not true deficiency thresholds and only represent the lower normal limit for domestic ruminants (Puls 1994, McDowell 2003). A one-way analysis of variance and a Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test were used to examine among year differences ( = 0.05) in rump fat depth, body condition scores (BCS), all blood parame ters, and minerals that were above the minimum detection limit (MDL) in order to quantify between year variations. A Spearman rank correlation analysis was c onducted to determine if a significant relationship existed between hematological and serum chemical parameters and depth of rump fat ( = 0.05). I used logist ic regression (Hosmer and Lemeshow 2000) to determine if there was a relationship between Cu levels and parturition rates for pregnant, captured moose and to estimate the level of Cu likely to induce peri natal mortality if a significant relationship was observe d. I also used a 2-sample t-test with equal variance to test for differences in serum a nd hair Cu concentrations and rump fat depths for pregnant cows observed with and without calves in the spring. All statistical analyses were performed with Statistix 8.0 software (Analy tical Software, Tallahassee, Florida, USA). 77RESULTS Moose Captures, Rump Fat, Disease, and Parasites Forty-eight adult female moose were captu red 61 times during the course of the study. Most captures occurred in February ( n = 54) from a helicopter ( n = 53). Nearly all ultrasonic rump fat measurements were recorded in February ( n = 41) with the exception of 5 that were measured in early to mid-March. There was no attempt to distinguish rump fat depth between cows with and without calves at their side because of inconsistencies in reporting the presence of a calf during capture efforts. Mean rump fat depth did not differ significantly among years (2005-2007; f(2,43) = 0.9, P = 0.399; Table 3.2). There were no differences between rump fat depth for pre gnant cows observed with ( n = 8) or without calves ( n = 31) in the spring ( P = 0.246, df =37). Differences were observed in BCS among years ( f(2,51) = 4.8, P = 0.012) and post hoc analyses indicated that BCS in 2005 were significantl y higher than in either 2006 or 2007 (Table 3.2). Sampled moose ( n = 59) were negative for antigens against B. abortus in all years and for Leptospira , infectious bovine rhinotracheitis vi rus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, parainfluenza-3 virus, and bovine re spiratory syncytial virus in 2005 ( n = 20). Tick loads were relatively low and 30-second counts av eraged 2.8 ticks/moose with 55 of 59 moose hosting < 10 ticks. No moose ( n = 56) had evidence of ear mites and fluke eggs were not observed in any sample ( n = 43). Fecal examinations ( n = 44) indicated a low infection ( 12 eggs/gm) of Nematodirus spp. Serum Chemical and Analyses There were significant di fferences among yea rs for Hb ( P = 0.053) or platelets (P = 0.104), but differences were evident for PCV ( f(2,48) = 9.5, P < P P = ( f(2,48) = 4.7, P = 0.013; Table 3.3). No consistent increasing or decreasing patterns were observed for PCV, MCHC, or RBCs, but WBCs exhibited a generally increasing trend with 2005 significantly lower than 2007. The percen t composition of WBCs did not differ significantly among years for lymphocytes ( P = 0.089), eosinophils monocytes ( P but significant differences were observed for neutrophils ( f(2,48) = 4.7, P = 0.014) and post hoc analyses indicated that 2007 was significantly lower than 2005 and 2006 (Table 3.3). For serum chemical analyses, there we re no significant differences among years for ALP ( P = 0.149) and GGT ( P = but significant differences were found for ALB ( f(2,54) = 19.0, P < 0.005), 10.3, P < 0.005), 4.7, P < P 23.6, P < 12.5, P < 0.005), f(2,54) = 48.3, P < 0.005; Table 3.4). No consistent increasing or decreasi ng patterns were observed for ALB, AST, BUN, globulins, glucose, LDH, and TSP. However, CK values exhibited a generally increasing pattern with 2007 means signifi cantly greater than 2005 (Table 3.4). Serum analyses showed significant di fferences among years for all three macronutrients (Ca: f(2,54) = 35.7, P < 0.005; P: f(2,54) = 4.93, P = 0.011; Table 3.4), but no consistent increas ing or decreasing patterns were observed. Serum Ca annual means exceeded the 8.0 mg/d l threshold (see Table 3.1) in 2006 and 792007, but were just below this level in 2005 (Table 3.4). When moose were compar ed individually, 18% (11 of 58) had Ca levels below the 8.0 mg/dl threshold. Fifty-seven percent (33 of 58) of sampled moose were below the 4.5 mg/dl threshold (see Table 3.1) for serum P and annual means were below this level in 2005 and 2007 (Table 3.4). Serum Mg annual means exceeded the 1.8 mg/d l threshold (see Table 3.1) during all years (Table 3.4) and only 12% (7 of 57) of individual moose were below this level. The proportions of moose with PCV, Hb, T SP, Ca, and P values lower than those reported for Alaskan moose considered to be in average to above average condition (see Table 3.1) varied (Table 3.5) . Most sampled moose fell below the average moose thresholds for Hb, Ca, and P. Approximate ly half of the moose sampled were below average for PCV while only one-third were be low for TSP. Mean Hb concentrations were lower in all years while PCV was lower in 2006 and 2007 (Table 3.3). Serum levels of Ca and P were lower in all years and TSP was lower in 2005, but higher than the average moose threshold in 2006 and 2007 (Table 3.4). Of the 13 serum chemical parameters analyzed, 2 exhibited a significant relationship with rump fat depth ( n = 43). Aspartate aminotransferase (r s = -0.339, P = 0.041; Figure 3.1) and LDH (r s = -0.327, P = 0.049; Figure 3.2) were both inversely correlated with depth of rump fat. The enzyme CK revealed a partia l correlation that was negatively related to rump fat (r s = -0.317, P = 0.057; Figure 3.3) when all moose were included. However, when one moose with a CK value >1000 U/l was removed from analyses, the direction of correlation reversed and the relationship became insignificant (r s = 0.237, P = 0.130). No significant relationshi p was observed between rump fat and any hematological parameters ( n = 38). 80Serum and Hair Trace Mineral Analyses Serum Cu, Fe, and Zn were detected in all m oose (Table 3.6), whereas Mn and Mb had levels below the MDL and were not detected in any sample. There was not a significant difference among years in Cu ( P = 0.329), but significant differences were observed for Fe ( f(2,47) = 3.79, P = 0.030) and Zn ( f(2,47) = 25.1, P < 0.005). No consistent increasing or decreasing patterns were observe d for the annual means of Fe and Zn. When compared to domestic ruminants (see Table 3.1), sampled moose were deficient in Cu during all years and deficient in Zn in 2005 and 2007 (Table 3.6). When examined individually, a high proportion of moose were deficient in Cu and Zn (Table 3.6) and all moose above the Zn deficiency threshold were sampled in 2006 ( n = 15). Serum Fe annual means exceeded the 1.1 ppm threshold (see Table 3.1) during all years and only 2% (1 of 50) of individual moose were below this level (Table 3.6). Hair concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Hg, Mb, Ni, Se, Tl, V, and Sn were consistently below MDL whereas all samples had detectable levels of Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn (Table 3.6). There were no significant differences among years in Cu ( P = 0.279), Mn ( P = ( P = 0.080), but significant diffe rences were evident for Ba (f(2,56) = 3.34, P = 0.043), Cr ( f(2,56) = 4.80, P = 0.012), Fe P = = 11.80, P < 0.005). No consistent increa sing or decreasing patterns were observed in concentrations of Ba, Cr, and Z n, but Fe concentrations showed a generally decreasing pattern with 2007 means significantly lower than 2005. Hair annual means for Cu, Fe, Zn, and Mn were below deficien cy thresholds for domestic ruminants (see Table 3.1) during all years (Table 3.6). When examined individually, all moose were 81deficient in Cu, Zn, and Mn while all but 3 moose were below the deficiency threshold for Fe (Table 3.6). In order to test the hypothe sis that a stressful event (i.e., captures) ma y increase the incidence of perinatal mortality, I examined the relationship between serum and hair Cu concentrations collected from adult female moose in winter and the presence of a calf in spring. All years were pooled and logistic regression failed to reveal a significant relationship between mean serum ( P = 0.275, df = 35; Figure hair ( P = 0.231, df = 44; Figure 3.5) Cu concentrations and the pr esence of a calf in the spring. The mean serum Cu concentration for pregnant cows observed with a calf was 0.52 ppm (SD = 0.08, n = 9) and for pregnant cows not observed with a calf was 0.47 ppm (SD = 0.11, n = 28). The mean hair Cu concentration for pregnant cows observed with a calf was 4.62 ppm (SD = 0.69, n = 11) and for pregnant cows not observed with a calf was 4.56 ppm (SD = 0.70, n = 35). There were no significant differences between mean serum ( t = -1.22, df = 35, P = 0.230) or hair ( t = -0.23, df = 44, P = 0.821) Cu concentrations and the presence of a calf in the spring. DISCUSSION Blood Parameters and Rump Fat Although PCV, Hb, TSP, Ca, and P have been used to evaluate habitat quality and the nutritional status of Alaskan moose (Franzmann and LeResche 1978), none of these parameters were correlated with rump fat dept h of Shiras moose in this study. My results suggest that the serum enzymes AST and L DH may be good predictors Shiras moose 82condition as indexed by ultras onic rump fat measurements. Similar to m y study, AST was found to be negatively correlated with rump fat of Alaskan moose (Keech et al. 1998). The authors suggested that decreased AST levels reduced moose susceptibility to disease since they were generally in better physical conditio n. Although this may be true, AST and LDH are indicators of muscle or organ damage generally associated with exertional myopathy (EM; Williams and Thorne 1996). Levels of AST for Shiras moose were not indicative of EM and were well below values reported for bighorn sheep ( Ovis canadensis ) that were stressed or subsequently developed EM (Kock et al. 1987). Additionally, levels of AST were well below values reported for normal moose (Haigh et al. 1977) which suggests that EM had little influence on these relationships. The inverse relationships that I observed between AST, LDH, and rump fat are consistent with increased utilization of body proteins from muscle and orga n tissues as lipid reserves decline in lean animals. Indeed, Cherel et al . (1992) observed a similar trend in that lean rats utilized greater amounts of muscle prot ein during phase II fa sting (i.e., protein sparing) than did obese rats. While I obs erved a significant relationship between two serum enzymes and rump fat depth, similar to research conducted on caribou ( Rangifer tarandus ; Messier et al. 1987), elk (Cook et al. 2001) and moose (Keech et al. 1998), I cannot conclude that a set of blood parameters has been identif ied that accurately reflects Shiras moose nutritional status as indexed by rump fat at this time. Maximum rump fat depth indicated that m oose in the study area were in relatively good physical condition. When compared to ru mp fat of moose captu red during early to mid-March in Alaska (Keech et al. 1998, Be rtram and Vivion 2002, Boertje et al. 2007), the study population displayed nearly two times more rump fat. Although I was unable to 83compare rump fat for moose with and without calves at side, several studies have reported that cow moose with greater amounts of r ump fat were not tending calves (Testa and Adams 1998, Keech et al. 2000). Therefore, it might be that fewer cows had calves at side which resulted in the higher rump fat depths observed in the study area. While rump fat may be a useful predictor of reproductive success within moose populations, it appears to be an insensitive index of fitness when compar ed across populations (Boertje et al. 2007). Heard et al. (1997) suggested that moose popul ations living in relatively harsh environments or in areas with low forage quality or quantity may have a higher fat-fertility threshold than moose populations li ving in milder climates with good quality forage. Thus, the higher rump fat depths observed for the stu dy population may be a result of a lack of quality forage and a need for moose to maintain a greater fat threshold so that reproductive potential was maximized. Nonetheless, a larger sample of rump fat measurements collected across multiple locations may provide a more accurate assessment of baseline rump fat levels a nd the subsequent impacts on reproductive performance for moose in Wyoming. Similar to evaluations of el k condition (Cook et al. 2001), the thickness of specific muscles measur ed via ultrasonogra phy could provide an additional index that may be used in association with rump fat depth to provide a more accurate assessment of the physical condition (i.e., protein versus fat catabolism) of Shiras moose populations. Moose in the study area appeared to be in moderate physical condition based on the five blood parameters (PCV, Hb, TSP, Ca, and P) considered to be good predictors of moose nutritional status (Fra nzmann and LeResche 1978). This indicated that habitat conditions may be slightly suboptimal, but it is not very good or very poor. When 84compared to Alaskan moose considered to be in good to excellen t condition (Franzmann and LeResche 1978), most adult female moose sampled were below reference values for PCV, Hb, Ca, and P and above the referen ce value for TSP. When these five blood parameters were further compared to an expanding, highly productive population and one that was in poor condition from Alaska (i.e ., populations on the extremes; Franzmann et al. 1987), moose from the study area were interm ediate. Due to the high variability in these blood parameters for populations that fall within the extremes and annual variation potentially caused by the severity of winter s (Ballard et al. 1996), ranking one population against another may be impractic al (Franzmann et al. 1987). Macro- and Micronutrients Adult female moose in the study area e xhibited annual variation in nearly all macro- and micronutrients. These results indicate that the nutriti onal quality of moose browse exhibits similar annual variation. Ind eed, researchers in Alaska and Sweden have reported high annual variation in the mineral content of moose browse even in the same plant (Oldemeyer et al. 1977, Ohlson and Staal and 2001). It has been suggested that a diversity of browse species can better meet the nutritional requirements of moose than a single, highly abundant species (Oldemey er et al. 1977, Miquelle and Jordan 1979, Ohlson and Staaland 2001). Moose in the st udy area utilized low- elevation, riparian habitats dominated by large communities of willow intermixed with small stands of conifers and aspen during winter (Chapter 2), thus it may be assumed that willow composed a high proportion of the winter diet as well. Therefore, if willows are deficient in certain nutrients, moose that consume high quantities of willow will also be deficient 85in these elements. Analysis of forage quality is a more precise indica tor of deficiency in most cases (McDowell 2003), thus future i nvestigations that e xplore potential links between diet diversity and nutritional deficiencies in Shiras moose will likely be informative. Since moose acquire nutrients directly fr om the plants they consume (McDowell 2003), low concentrations of some minerals in serum and hair i ndicated nutritional limitations associated with moose habitat in the study area. My results indicated that moose winter forage may have been limited in Cu, Zn, Mn, and P. Deficiencies in any nutrient are most likely to occur during winter when the availability and mineral content of forage is most limited (Kubota et al. 1970, Oldemeyer et al. 1977, Ohlson and Staaland 2001). Furthermore, increased intra- and interspecific competition for limited winter forage (O'Hara et al. 2001) may exacerbate existing nutritional deficiencies due to overutilization of resources (B arboza et al. 2003). Moose may be highly susceptible to nutritional deficiencies (Murray et al. 2006) and, although Cu, Zn, Mn, and P deficiencies are difficult to diagnose in wild populations, the physiological imbalances that they may create could have had a c onsiderable impact on the pe rformance of the population, particularly for the developing fetus and calf. While I cannot conclude that low or margin al Cu has contributed to recent moose declines, it remains a possibility. Copper c oncentrations in serum and hair indicated a potential deficiency among moose in the study ar ea. Most Cu is stored in the liver, but when levels fall below 20 g/g, serum and hair become sensitive indicators of Cu deficiency among domestic ruminants (C ombs 1987, Blakley et al. 1992, McDowell 2003). Copper is an essential nutrient for the developing fetus and fetal Cu demands 86greatly increase during the final trim ester of pregnancy (Puls 1994, McArdle 1995, Rombach et al. 2003), wh ich could increase the likelihood of reproductive failure if maternal Cu is deficient (Hidiroglou and Knipfel 1981, McDowell 2003). Serum Cu levels in moose from the study population were similar to levels observed by Gogan et al. (1989) in Cu deficient elk that experienced de creased adult survival and poor recruitment. Although direct comparisons cannot be made due to differences in dates of sample collection, faulty hoof keratinization and decr eased reproductive output have been linked to a Cu deficiency in moose from the Ke nai Peninsula, Alaska (Flynn et al. 1977). Several other studies have also suggested the possibility of reduced Cu intake as a cause of moose population declines in Sweden (Frank et al. 1994), Alaska (O'Hara et al. 2001), and Minnesota (Custer et al. 2004). There was no relationship between low or marginal serum and hair Cu levels and the reproductive output of pregnant moose cap tured during winter. This contrasts with the hypothesis proposed by O'Hara et al. (2001) who suggested that populations experiencing marginal Cu deficiencies may not exhibit clinical symptoms (i.e., decreased reproductive success) unless an additional stressful event occurred. Moose captured in southeast Wyoming with similar Cu con centrations did not experience decreased reproductive performance (E. Wald, University of Wyoming, unpublishe d data), but they were captured two months prior to moose in my study. It may be that the cumulative effects of stressors (i.e., low quality forage , moderate physical condition, environmental conditions) near the third trimester of pregnanc y combined with potential deficiencies in several other nutrients (i.e, Mn, Zn, P) cr eate physiological imbalances (Frank et al. 1994) that compromised repr oductive performance. 87 Concentrations of Mn in hair and Zn in serum and hair indicated a potential deficiency among m oose within the study area . All moose hair samples indicated a deficiency in these nutrients while approxima tely two-thirds of moose were serum above seru m Zn deficiency thresholds for domestic ruminants were sampled in 2006 and the higher levels observed were likely a result of sample contamination from incorrect collection procedures (Puls 1994). In domestic ruminants, clinical signs of Mn and Zn deficiencies include reduced reproductive performance and calf survival (Hid iroglou 1979, Hidiroglou and Knipfel 1981, McDowell 2003). To my knowledge, clinical signs of Zn deficiency have not been observed in wild moose populations. Although di rect comparisons cannot be made to the current study, Stewart and Flynn (1978) reported low Mn concen trations from moose hair in Saskatchewan, Canada even though clinical signs of deficiency were not observed. The reliability of using serum and hair to asse ss dietary intake of Mn and Zn is relatively low (Smart et al. 1981, Combs 1987, McDowell 2003), but the possibility remains that deficiencies may have impacted moose in the study area. The low serum P observed in the sa mple population from 2005 and 2007 may have been partially due to the effects of capture. Although Franzmann and LeResche (1978) did not observe changes in P con centrations during their study, Karns and Crichton (1978) did observe a decrease in P from the time of capture to release in caribou. The capture techniques used dur ing my study may have delayed sample collection in some moose cau sing a decrease in P concentrations. Nonetheless, McDowell (2003) noted that P had to be consis tently below the deficiency threshold to consider a population deficient. Since moose were not defici ent in all thre e years of the 88study, there is only an indication of a poten tial deficiency that warrants continued evaluation. Parasites and Disease Insignificant loads of endoparasites were detected in some fecal samples and tick counts indicated a relatively low infestation of winter ticks in th e study area. The low tick counts observed may have been partia lly due to inexperience in identifying the nymph stage which was common during captures in February. However, patterns of hair discoloration and loss in March and April (Lankester and Samuel 1997, Samuel 2004) also indicated relatively low tick loads on m oose from the northern part of my study area while moose that occupied ranges to the sout h appeared to carry higher tick loads. In Alberta, Canada, Drew and Samuel (1986) not ed that snow cover during April adversely affected tick survival, but warm, dry spring conditions may enhance tick reproductive success resulting in an increased abundance the following autumn (Delguidice et al. 1997, Samuel 2004). Field observations indicated that snow cover remained longer into spring on the northern ranges, but disappeared ra pidly to the south. Similar to what has been observed on Isle Royale (Delguidice et al. 1997) and in central Alberta (Samuel and Baker 1979), an increase in ambient temperatur es during spring could reduce snow cover which may result in an increased number of ticks and, potentially, an increased incidence of tick-induced mortalities the following spring (Lankester and Samuel 1997, Samuel 2004). Diseases did not appear to be impacting moose in the study area. Elk seroprevalence for brucellosis was 12.5% in the Buffalo Valley (Barbknecht 2008), thus 89there was potential for disease transmission on winter range. However, experime ntal studies of brucellosis in moos e indicated that they may be a dead-end host for the disease because infection leads to rapid mortality (For bes et al. 1996). Deaths associated with brucellosis infection have not been obse rved among moose in the GYE (Cook and Rhyan 2003), but clinical symptoms of infection may not be observed prior to death due to the rapid progression of the disease in moose. MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS Measures of physiological health of adu lt female Shiras moose in the study area indicated that they were in moderate physical condition and appeared to have deficiencies of several important nutrients. Conseque ntly, they may be more susceptible to environmental stressors that could result in increased mortality and decreased reproductive performance. These effects may be most evident during spring following a severe winter. Indeed, this population ha s experienced increased spring mortalities before and it was suspected that the combin ation of severe winters and habitat quality may have contributed to population fluctuations from 1950-1966 (Houston 1968). Therefore, habitat improvement projects coul d be initiated on primary moose winter ranges to improve habitat quality. This could be completed on a large-scale over multiple years so that high numbers of moose do not reduce the growth poten tial of preferred forage and the amount of available forage remains sufficient even during high snow years. In addition to twi nning rates and age of first re production, the percent utilization of current annual growth of pr eferred forage has been identif ied as an additional measure 90to assess the nutritional status of a populati on (Boertje et al. 2007) , thus managers could also expand current habitat monitoring progr ams to document browse removal rates of preferred winter forage as well as th e nutritional quality of the habitat. Because the combination of nutritional deficiencies and relatively high rump fat levels indicated a high fat-fe rtility threshold for this m oose population (Heard et al. 1997), the continued collection of rump fat measurements and reproductive performance data remains paramount. Only after sufficien t baseline data are available on rump fat depths can interpretation of th e fat-fertility threshold for the population be evaluated. Rump fat measurements could be collected fr om harvested moose at check stations which may provide managers with a general index of the nutritional condition within herd units statewide. Blood samples can also be coll ected to further examine the relationship between rump fat depth, AST, and LDH. If after further evaluation this relationship appears valid, managers may be able to asse ss the nutritional condition of moose without the need for an ultrasound. 91LITERATURE CITED Arnemo, J.

By understanding de mographic parameters, managers can make more informed decisions regarding management practices that may reduce the effects of factors limiting population growth. Limiting fact ors can be broadly defined as aspects of the environment or interactions among species that alter vital rates re sulting in a change in the observed population growth rate (Messier 1991, Messier 1994, Van Ballenberghe and Ballard 1994). While experimental determination of the relative forces that control population growth is difficult, insights into causal mechanisms may be inferred by detailed demographic studies . In comparison to analys es of population trend data, demographic studies (i.e., estimation of indi vidual vital rates) can reveal the proximal factors that may influence population growth such as re source limitation, predation, disease, competition, or seve ral factors working in combination. Although controversy remains in regards to population limitation or regulation of ungulates (Boutin 1992, Van Ballenberghe and Ballard 1994), the two factors most often identified as influencing the rate of population growth, either singly or in combination, are habitat and predation (Messier 1991, Testa 2004). 113Moose ( Alces alces ) are an important game species and play a vital role in complex ecosystems with multiple predator and prey assemblages. While much research has been devoted to the population dynamics of moose, including some of the seminal work in population ecology (Peterson 1977), there is considerable variation regarding the relative influence of habitat a nd predation as limiting factors. For example, in interior Alaska, one moose population appeared to be limited primarily by density-dependent factors (Keech et al. 2000), while an adj acent population appeared to be limited by predation on calves (Bow yer et al. 1998). Much of the research conducted in No rth America on the d ynamics of moose populations has involved ecosystems where m oose were the dominant prey for large predators (Bergerud et al. 1983, Gasaway et al. 1992, Bertram and Vivion 2002). However, where moose are not the dominant prey, the factors influencing population dynamics may vary considerably (Gasaway et al. 1983, Ballard and Larsen 1987, Van Ballenberghe 1987, Kunkel and Pletscher 1999). The complexity of systems with multiple prey and predator species makes in ferences about single species interactions more difficult. Nonetheless, through the exam ination of demographic rates, researchers can infer potential mechanisms that may limit population growth. For example, moose twinning rates and the age of first reproduction are two parameters used by managers as a measure of the nutritional status of moose populations (Franzmann and Schwartz 1985, Keech et al. 2000, Boertje et al. 2007). Furthe rmore, the selective behavior of certain predators during specific life stag es can be used to infer the potential effects of predation on a population. For example, pred ation by either bears bears ( for the majority of neonatal moose calf 114mortalities (Ballard et al. 1991, Osborne et al. 1991, Bertram and Vivion 2002, Swenson et al. 2007), whereas th e impact of wolf ( Canis lupus ) af ter the neonate phase (Larsen et al. 1989, Ross and Jalkotzy 1996). Relatively little research has been conducted on the demography and population dynamics of Shiras moose ( A. a. shirasi ) in Kufeld and Bowden (1996) estimated Shiras moose survival in no rthcentral Colorado where legal and illegal harvest accounted for 91% of all mortalities. Olterman and Kenvin (1998) described the reproduction and survival of Shiras moose tr ansplanted to southwestern Colorado where black bears and cougars occurr ed at relatively low dens ities. Kunkel and a multipredator ecosystem in and near Glacier National Park, Montana, USA. They reported that moose survival rates were higher where alternate prey was abundant. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) provides an opportunity to explore further the complex dynamics of a population of Shiras moose where alternate prey is abundant (Boyce 1989, Lubow and Smith 2004), grizzly bears continue to expand their range (Schwartz et al. 2006), and gray wolves were re cently reintroduced (Bangs and Fritts 1996). Indices of population density and calf-cow ratios since the late 1980s have suggested a declining trend in Shiras moose numbers in northwest Wyoming, USA (Chapter 1). This population was previously thought to be limite d by density-dependent factors (Berger et al. 1999, Berger et al. 2001 ), but the recent expansion of grizzly bears and gray wolves into the area has led to questions regarding the relative influence of 115predation (Brimeyer and Thomas 2004). Th erefore, m y goal was to estimate the reproductive parameters and demographic rates of the north Jackson moose herd and use these estimates to evaluate the relative influence of factors that may be limiting population growth. My objectives were to: (1 ) estimate reproductive parameters, neonate survival, and annual calf survival, (2) estimate adult ( 2 years) female and male annual survival rates, (3) use the estim ated vital rates to calculate th e finite rate of growth and conduct associated sensitivity analyses, and (4) make inferences as to the relative influence of limiting factors based on study results and information from previous research. My results may assist managers with decisions regarding the management of Shiras moose populations in multiple predator and prey ecosystems. STUDY AREA The study area encompassed approximately 6,400 km 2 of predominately public land in northwest Wyoming (Figure 4.1). It was north of the town of Jackson, Wyoming and included portions of Grand Teton Nationa l Park (GTNP), Yellowstone National Park (YNP), and the Bridger-Teton National Fore st (BTNF) where elevations ranged from 1,866 to 4,197 m. The study area included the upper Snake River and upper Yellowstone River watersheds. Moose wintered in low-el evation, riparian-domin ated habitats along the Snake River and its primary tributaries (i .e., Pacific Creek, Buffalo Fork River, Gros Ventre River; Houston 1968, Chapter 2). Du ring summer, migratory moose traveled to more dispersed, mid-elevation ranges (Chapter 2), whereas nonmigratory individuals remained on low-elevation ranges (Houston 1968). Dominant vegetation types varied 116with elevation and aspect (Whitlock 1993, Knight 1994) and were described in Chapter 2 of this thesis. The climate was characterized by short, cool summers and long, cold winters. From 1975 to 2004, annual precipitation averaged 56 cm (range 38-79 cm; http://www.cdc. noaa.gov/cgi-bin/Timeseri es/timeseries1.pl; accessed 16 October 2005), with most of the annual precipitation falling as snow between November and May. The Teton Mountains to the west and the norther n highlands along the southern boundary of YNP typically received th e greatest amounts of preci pitation (Houston 1968, Cole 1969, Boyce 1989). The study area contained several other populations of large ungulates. The Jackson elk herd consisted of 14,000-18,000 el k, of which approximately 70% were supplementally fed on the National Elk Refuge or state-run feedgrounds during winter. These elk migrated to more dispersed ranges during summer (Boyce 1989, Lubow and Smith 2004). Resident populations of inhabited the Jackson Valley a nd a migratory population of pronghorn (Antilocapra americana ) traveled to the area during summer (Sawyer et al. 2005). Grizzly bears occurred throughout the study ar ea and have steadily expanded their range in the GYE since the early 1990s (Schwartz et al. 2006). Gray wolves dispersed from YNP to the Jackson Valley during the winter of 1997-1998 (Smith et al. 1999) and as of 2007, seven packs ( n 82 wolves), consisting of at least six breeding pairs, inhabited portions of the study area (Jimenez et al. 2008). It was suspected that cougar populations also increased in recent years (Wyoming Ga me and Fish Department [WGFD] 2006, H. 117Quigley, Beringia South, pers onal communication) while harv est data indicated tha t black bear populations in the study ar ea remained relatively stable (WGFD 2007 a). The study area included the northern portion of the Jackson moose herd unit and encompassed WGFD hunt areas 7, 14, 15, 17, a nd 32 (Figure 4.1), as we ll as hunt area 8 in the Absaroka moose herd unit. Hunt ar eas 7, 14, and 32 in the Teton Wilderness were closed to all moose harvest during the 2005 and 2006 hunting seasons and in 2007, these areas were opened to limited quota, antlered only moose harvest (WGFD 2007 b). The remaining hunt areas in the study area allowed antlered only, limited quota harvest for the duration of the study. At the end of biological year 2006, the population estimate for Jackson moose herd unit was 1,785 moose a nd the population objectiv e for the entire herd unit was 3,600 moose (WGFD 2007 b). METHODS Moose Captures Adult moose were captured on winter range between January and March 2005- 2008. Moose were darted from the ground or a helicopter and immobilized with 10-mg thiafentanil (A-3080, Wildlife Pharmaceuticals, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA; McJames et al. 1994, Arnemo et al. 2003, Kreeger et al. 2005) in 2005 and 2006 and 10-mg carfentanil (Wildnil, Wildlife Pharmaceuticals, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA) in 2007. Immobilization drugs were delivered in a 1-ml dart (Pneu-dart, Williamsport, Pennsylvania, USA) fired from a CO 2-powered dart rifle (Dan-Inject North America, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA) or a 0.22-calib er-blank dart rifle (Model 193, Pneu-dart, 118Williamsport, Pennsylvania, USA). Once ha ndling was completed, thiaf entanil or carfentanil Wildlife Pharmaceuticals, Fort Coll ins, Colorado, USA; Kreeger et al. 2005) administered at multiple sites. In 2008, a dult female moose were captured via helicopter net-gunning. Age was estimated from inciso r tooth wear (Hindela ng and Peterson 1994) and numbered, aluminum ear tags were affixed to each ear. Approximately 50-ml of blood were collected from all moose via j ugular venipuncture and fecal samples were collected from adult females in 2007. Adu lt females were fitted with either global positioning system (GPS; model TGW-3700, Telonics, Mesa, Arizona, USA) or very high frequency (VHF) radio transmitters (model M2710, Advanced Telemetry Systems, Isanti, Minnesota, USA) and all adult males were fitted with VHF collars. All radio collars were equipped with mortality-sensing options and VHF collars were fitted with a cotton spacer that would rot away in 3-4 years which allowed for collar retrieval prior to termination of battery life. Captures we re performed in accordance with approved University of Wyoming Animal Ca re and Use Committee protocols. Adult Survival In addition to moose captured during this study, I monitored 18 adult female moose that had been fitted w ith VHF collars in previous ye ars (Berger et al. 1999, Berger et al. 2001). Radio-collared moose were monitored monthly from fixed-wing aircraft during May to December of each year. While moose were concentrated on winter range, ground surveys were conducted to monitor su rvival from January to May. Although cause of mortality was not a primary st udy objective, all mortality signals were 119investigated on foot and site investigations and field ne cropsies were performed to determ ine cause of death where possible. I assessed moose condition at time of death based on the color and consistency of femur bone marrow and scored the moose into 1 of 3 classes that generally represented per cent femur marrow fat (Peterson 1977:30). I examined all available bones for evidence of abnormalities (i.e., arthritis, healed breaks, jaw necrosis). If available, two incisors were collected and age was determined by cementum annuli (Sargeant and Pimlott 1959) at the WGFD Laboratory (Laramie, Wyoming, USA). I considered predation to be the cause of death when subcutaneous hemorrhaging and evidence of a chase or struggle were present (Kunkel et al. 1999, Atwood et al. 2007). I identifie d the predator species respon sible for the mortality using predator-specific characte ristics such as injury patterns, point of a ttack, method of killing, and carcass location (Atwood et al. 2007) and used a key adapted from Kunkel et al. (1999) to categorize predator-rel ated mortalities as being pos sible, probable, or positive predation by cougar, wolf, or bear (black or grizzly). If evidence of predation was not present, mortalities were charac terized as being of natural ca uses and were classified as malnutrition, disease, or other natural cause. Mortalities were classified as unknown if site evidence and carcass inspection were inconclu sive as to cause of death. If mortalities occurred within 30 days post-capture and no cause of death could be determined, the death was classified as a capture-related mort ality (Kreeger et al. 2005). If the date of death was unknown, it was estimated using the midpoint between the last time the signal was active and the first time a mortality sign al was heard (Modafferi and Becker 1997). Dates of death for moose fitted with GPS collars were estimated by downloading the 120collar and locating the first known location in a point cluster where the carcass was found. I attempted to maintain 2 0-25 radio-co llared females and males at the beginning of each biological year (BY; 1 June - 31 May) during the study (Garton et al. 2001). I used the staggered entry Kaplan-Meier proce dure to estimate annual survival rates of adult females and males on a monthly basis for each BY and used log-rank tests to compare sex-specific survival among BYs (Kap lan and Meier 1958, Pollock et al. 1989). Capture-related mortalities were censored from survival analyses and all moose censored due to radio failure were removed the month that radio contact was lost. Adult male survival rates were estimated with harvest censored and with all forms of mortality included to examine differences in survival with and without harv est. The number of moose at risk at the beginning of each m onth was pooled across BYs to estimate sex- specific survival rates for the duration of th e study even if annual differences were observed. The adult female survival rate es timate was used to evaluate the population growth rate during the entire study period (see below). I then used a log-rank test to compare female and male survival rates fo r the duration of the study (Pollock et al. 1989). Reproduction and Calf Survival Pregnancy status was determined by analys is of blood sera for concentrations of pregnancy-specific protein B (PSPB) by BioTracking (Moscow, Idaho, USA; Stephenson et al. 1995, Huang et al. 2000). Fecal sa mples were analyzed for progestagen concentration at the Smithsonian Institute C onservation Research Ce nter (Front Royal, 121Virginia, USA) following methods described by Monfort et al. (1993) and Schwartz et al. (1995). Due to differences among populations in fecal progestagen cu toff values for pregnant and nonpregnant moose (Muir 2006), I used a regression tree analysis (De'ath and Fabricius 2000) to estimate a fecal proge stagen cutoff value from fecal samples collected at capture in 2007. For this anal ysis, the dependent variable was the fecal progestagen value and the res ponse variable was pregnancy st atus based on PSPB. This gave an estimated fecal progestagen cutoff valu e and the probability that this value would accurately predict pregnant and non-pregnant st atus. To estimate the timing of potential fetal mortalities and the efficacy of proge stagen in determining pregnancy status, additional fecal samples were collected from handled and unhandled moose 1-2 months post-capture in 2006 and 2007. Fecal progestagen concentrations were compared to the pregnancy cutoff value to determine if losse s occurred prior to or after the date of collection. All radio-collared adult female moose were surveyed from the ground or air during late May to early June of each year (Van Ballenberghe and Ballard 1997, Boertje et al. 2007) to assess parturit ion rates because peak parturition typically occurs around 25 May across much of North America (Hauge and Kieth 1981, Schwartz and Hundertmark 1993, Bowyer et al. 1998, Te sta et al. 2000, Bertram a nd Vivion 2002). Helicopter surveys were conducted with the pilot and two observers between 31 May and 7 June 2005-2007. Radio-collared cows not observe d with a calf dur ing initial aerial observations were surveyed again from the ai r usually within 1 or 2 days. Prior to concluding that a cow was not accompanied by a calf, attempts were made to obtain the clearest view of the cow possible on the sec ond survey and the behavior of the cow (i.e., 122standing, running, or aggressivene ss) was noted. If I was unable to conclude from aerial observations that a cow was accompanied by a calf, a ground search was conducted on foot or horseback. To assess parturition ra tes for moose that were not captured during winter (i.e., unhandled), I fi rst estimated the number of pregnant unhandled moose by multiplying the known pregnancy rate of captured moose by the total number of unhandled moose surveyed in each year. Partur ition rates were calculated by dividing the total number of unhandled cows observed with calves by the total number surveyed that were assumed to be pregnant. Twinning ra tes were assessed by dividing the number of cows observed with twins by the total num ber of cows with calves. All radio-collared females were surveyed from the ground or air approximately 8 weeks after parturition surveys to estimate ne onate survival. Protocols for these surveys were the same as parturition surveys. I chose to survey all radio-collared females so that late births could be observed. Late births were included in es timates of parturition rates, but neonate survival was estimated only from those calves that were observed in June. Ground surveys of all radio- collared females observed with calves during neonate surveys were conducted during late Marc h and April 2006-2008 to assess annual calf survival. Since calves were not collared, the fa te of calves that were lost due to death or radio failure of the collared cow were unknow n, thus, these calves were censored from analyses. Surveys of females that lost ca lves between parturition and neonate surveys were also made to assess the efficacy of neonate surveys. I used the Kaplan-Meier procedure and the log-rank test (K aplan and Meier 1958, Pollock et al. 1989) to estimate neonate and a nnual calf survival rates and to test for differences among years. I also used the lo g-rank test (Pollock et al. 1989) to assess 123among-year variation in pregnancy rates. To determine if captu re had an effect on parturition rates, neonate survival, and annua l calf survival, I used the log-rank test (Pollock et al. 1989) to compare these pa ram eters between the handled and unhandled samples of moose within years. Population Modeling I used a simple post-birth, Lefkovich matrix model for females that assumed constant vital rates over time to characte rize moose population growth during the study period (Caswell 2001, Skalski et al. 2005). The matrix was parameterized into 3 stage classes (i.e., calf, yearling, adult). The top ro w of the matrix (i.e., productivity elements) was the product of survival, parturition, and fecundity rates for yearlings and adults. Because calves do not reach sexual matur ity by autumn (Edwards and Ritcey 1958, Schladweiler and Stevens 1973, Schwartz and Hundertmark 1993), they were not allowed to breed in the model. The adult fecundity rate was calculated by dividing the total number of calves produced by the total number of parturient, radio-collared females. In Alaska, calf sex ratios at birth did not differ (Schwartz and Hundertmark 1993), so I assumed a 50:50 sex ratio and divided fecund ity by 2 to estimate the number of female calves produced per parturient female. Sin ce yearlings were not monitored, I assumed yearling parturition and survival from the l iterature. Houston (1968) estimated a yearling pregnancy rate of 0.057 in the Jackson Va lley, Wyoming based on corpora lutea counts of 35 harvested 2.5-year-old moose. I used th is pregnancy rate for yearlings and assumed that yearling parturition rates were a sim ilar fraction of the adu lt parturition rate. Yearling fecundity was assumed to be 0.50 because yearlings rarely produce twins 124(Pimlott 1959, Schwartz 1997). Although severa l researchers have described lower yearling survival rates when compared to adults (Dodge et al. 2004, Testa 2004, Murray et al. 2004), researchers in Al aska indicated that yearling survival rates were sim ilar to adult survival rates (Ballard et al. 1991), thus, I assumed that yearling and adult survival rates were equal. From the parameterized matrix, I calculated a deterministic estimate of the finite rate of population growth ( ; Caswell 2001, Skalski et al . 2005). To examine the influence of each vital rate on , I calculated the elasticity of each matrix element using PopTools (G. M. Hood, 2004; PopTools version 3.0.2. http://www.cse.csiro.au/ poptools). I used a parametric bootstrap procedure to estimate 95% confidence intervals (CI) for . I assumed a binomial distribution of vital rates and generated 1,000 random replicates of each vital rate based on the mean and the total number of experimental units used to estimate each vital rate during the study. I then generated 1,000 simulated Lefkovich matrix replicates to estimate from random combinations of each vital rate. The mean estimate was calculated from the simulated data and 95% CI were estimated from the distribution of resulting values. RESULTS Moose Captures Eighty adult female moose were captured 93 times during the course of the study. From 2005 to 2007, 53 of 61 adult females were darted from a helicopter. Thirty-two females were captured with helicopter net-gunnin g in 2008. Most adult males were 125darted from a helicopter ( n = 21) and radio-collared in 2005 ( n = 27) and 2006 ( n = 4). Four suspected capture-related mortalities (2 female, 2 male) occurred during the study and these individuals were cen sored from survival analysis . One female moose died 9 days post-capture in 2005. Field necropsy was unable to reveal an apparent cause of death and no problems were recorded during handling. One male died at 3 weeks and another at 4 weeks post-capture in 2005 after being darted from the ground. The first male that died was relatively old (12 yrs) and field necropsy revealed severe malnutrition (i.e., no body or organ fat, depleted femur marrow). Necropsy revealed gross lesions on the lungs of the second male consistent with pneumonia that was possibly caused by aspirated rumen contents during handling. In 2006, a single female was euthanized 1 day post-capture. Although serum did not reveal ex ertional myopathy as the cause, it was suspected due to partial paralysis of the front limbs. Pregnancy and Reproduction Analyses of PSPB from moose captu red during winters 2005-2007 indicated a high annual pregnancy rate that was not different among years ( P > 0.05; Table 4.1). To assess parturition rates, all ra dio-collared adult female m oose were surveyed from the ground or air between 25 May and 19 June 2005-2007. Two sets of twins in 2006 and one set of twins in 2007 were observed, wh ile no twins were observed in 2005 (Table 4.1). When years were pooled, the average twinning ra te was 0.07 (SE = 0.04, n = 45). The fecundity rate was estimated as 1.07 calves per parturient female. There was a significant difference in part urition rates between moose that were captured (i.e., 126handled) in winter and those that were not captured (i.e., unhandled) in 2005 ( 2 = 5.01, 1 df, P = 0.025) and 2006 ( 2 = 5.53, 1 df, P = 0.019), but a signifi cant difference was not observed in 2007 ( 2 = 2.86, 1 df, P = 0.091), possibly due to high variance in the estimates (Table 4.1). When compared within groups (i.e., handled and unhandled) among years, parturition rates did not differ ( P > 0.05; Table 4.1). Therefore, within group estimates were pooled among years a nd a significant differe nce was observed in the estimated parturition rates between handled and unhandled females ( 2 = 13.43, 1 df, P < 0.001; Table 4.1). Because of differences in parturition rates between handled and unhandled females, a second parturition survey was c onducted from the helicopter two weeks after the initial survey in 2005, but no additional calves were observed. Furthermore, no additional calves were observed during neonate survival surveys in July 2005 or annual calf survival surveys in March and April 2006 i ndicating that survey protocols adequately detected calf presence. To test the e ffects of capture tec hniques using the same immobilization drug (i.e., thiafentanil), 7 adult females were darted from the ground and 13 were darted from a helicopter in 2006. Sample sizes were small, but no females captured from the ground were observed with a calf (0 of 5), whereas 36% (4 of 11) of adult female moose immobilized by helicopte r were observed with a calf. In 2007, all moose were captured via helicopter with a diffe rent immobilization drug (i.e., carfentanil) and a similar trend was observed (Table 4.1). Using pregnancy status as determined by PSPB and the fecal samples collected at capture in 2007 ( n = 19), the regression tree analysis indicated that the pregnancy cutoff value for fecal progestagen was 2.52 g/g (Figure 4.2). The probability that this value 127would accurately predict pregnancy at captu re from fecal progestagen was 100%, whereas the probability that it would pr edict non-pregnancy was 60% (Figure 4.2). During 2006 and 2007, fecal samples were coll ected from 21 handled and 12 unhandled females > 1 month post-capture. Of the 14 pregnant, handled moose that were not observed with calves the following spring, 79% (n = 11) were determined not to be pregnant when fecal samples were collected based on the fecal progestagen cutoff value (Figure 4.3). The fecal progestagen cutoff value accurately predicted whether an unhandled female would be observed with a ca lf the following spring 92% (11 of 12) of the time (Figure 4.3). One unhandled and 3 handl ed moose appeared to lose their fetus or calf at a later date because progestagen indicated that these females were pregnant at time of sample collection. One handled female observed with a calf in the spring was misclassified as not pregnant (Figure 4.3). For moose that were handled and lost a cal f in the year of capture, the probability that they would be observed with a calf th e following year after not being captured was 80% (8 of 10). For unhandled moose obser ved with a calf in any given year, the probability that they would be observed with a calf the following year was 33% (6 of 18). When all moose were pooled regardless of being handled or unhandl ed, the probability that they would be observed with a calf in consecutive years wa s 31% (13 of 42). Neonate and Annual Calf Survival Because of small sample sizes for handled moose observed with calves, no comparisons were made of neonate and a nnual calf survival between handled and unhandled moose, thus all calves produced each year were pooled to examine annual 128differences. All radio-collare d adult female moos e were surveyed from the ground or air between 17 and 24 July 2005-2007 to document neona te survival and la te births. There were 3 late births observed in 2006 and 1 in 2007. One calf was censored in 2006 due to loss of radio contact with the cow between parturition and neona te surveys. No significant differences were observed in neonate survival among years ( P > 0.05; Table 4.1). When years were pooled, 16 of 42 calves were lost between parturition and neonate surveys for an average survival rate of 0.62 (SE = 0.08; Table 4.1). In March and April 2006-2008, radio-collared cows observed with calves in June and July of the previous year were survey ed on winter range to estimate annual calf survival rates. No calves that were lost between parturition and neonate surveys were observed with the cow on winter range. Si x calves were censored from analysis due to radio failure (1 in 2006, 3 in 2007) or death of the radio-collared cow prior to surveys (2 in 2008). All late births observed were include d in analyses of calf survival and 2 of 3 successfully returned to winter range while 1 was lost due to radio collar failure of the cow. No significant differences were obser ved in annual calf survival among years ( P > 0.05; Table 4.1). When years were pooled, 19 of 41 calves successf ully returned to winter range yielding an averag e annual calf survival rate of 0.46 (SE = 0.08; Table 4.1). Of 28 adult female moose monitored for 2 years, 11% returned to winter range with a calf at side 2 years in a row. Adult Survival To estimate annual survival rates, adult female moose were monitored for four consecutive BYs (i.e., 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007). A nnual female survival rates ranged from 0.77 (SE = 0.07) in BY 2006 to 0.94 (SE = 0.04) in BY 2005 (Table 4.2). The 129survival rate estimate for BY 2005 was signi ficantly different from estimates for BY 2006 (2 = 4.34, 1 df, P = 0.037) and BY 2007 (2 = 3.92, 1 df, P = 0.048; Table 4.2). No significant differences were observed in a nnual survival rates am ong any other years ( P > 0.05; Table 4.2). Survival rates were estimated for adu lt male moose for all BYs (i.e., 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007), but comparisons and interpretati ons were limited to BY 2005 and BY 2006 because these years contained a full year of data and adequate sample sizes. There were no significant differences in survival rate estimates between BY 2005 and BY 2006 when harvest was included as a mortality factor ( 2 = 0.01, 1 df, P = 0.92) or when harvest was censored ( 2 = 0.00, 1 df, P > 0.99; Table 4.2). When survival rates were compared between harvest included and harvest censo red males within years, no significant differences were observed in estim ated survival rates for BY 2005 ( 2 = 0.82, 1 df, P = 0.365) or BY 2006 ( 2 = 0.50, 1 df, P = 0.48; Table 4.2). When years were pooled, the adult female survival rate estimate was 0.83 (SE = 0.03; Table 4.2). Pooled annual (i .e., all years) survival ra te estimates for males with harvest included was 0.82 (SE = 0.05) and with harvest censored it was 0.89 (SE = 0.04; Table 4.2). There was no signi ficant difference between annual survival rates of females and males when harvest was included ( 2 = 0.06, 1 df, P = 0.806) or when harvest was censored ( 2 = 2.18, 1 df, P = 0.140; Table 4.2). Adult female mortalities peaked during la te winter and early spring with 85% (22 of 26) of the observed mortalities occurring du ring the months of March, April, and May (Figure 4.4). Most female mortalities were classified as unknown due to high levels of scavenging or lack of site evidence. Pr edation accounted for 8 mortalities while 5 130females appeared to have died of natural caus es not related to pred ation (3 m alnutrition, 1 disease, 1 other natural causes; Figure 4.5) . One female moose killed by a cougar in March 2005 had evidence of jaw necrosis, but no evidence of any other bone abnormalities were found on the remaining individuals, whether female or male. There was no apparent temporal patter n to nonharvest-related adult male mortalities, but when harvest was included as a mortality factor, survival declined from September to November (Figure 4.6). Most male mortalitie s were classified as unknown primarily due to the remote locations of the mortality sites (Figure 4.5). The mean age of adult female and male mortalities was 7.1 years (SE = 0.84; n = 11) and 9.3 years (SE = 2.25; n = 2), respectively. The mean female bone marrow class was 1.8 ( n = 15) and male bone marrow class was 2.40 ( n = 5). Population Modeling Due to the differences observed in parturition rates between handled and unhandled moose, I used the unhandled moos e parturition rates to estimate calf production. Based on adult pregnancy and pa rturition rates, the expected yearling parturition rate was 0.05 and this was used to estimate yearling productivity. Using pooled vital rates estimated during the study, was calculated to be 0.973 (Figure 4.7). This indicated that the m oose population may be subject to a modest decline of approximately 2.7% annually. The mean estimate derived from 1,000 matrix replicates of randomly generated v ital rates was 0.972 (SE = 0.002) with 95% CI of 0.907-1.062 (Figure 4.9). This indicated that the moose population was sl ightly decreasing to stable during the study period, but there was some uncertainty in the estimate. Based on 131simulations, there was a 17% chance that the population had a positiv e growth rate and a 76% chance that it had a negative growth rate in any given year. Adult female survival had the highest elasticity (0.658), followed by calf survival (0.114), adult fecundity and yearling survival (0.113), and year ling fecundity (0.001; Figure 4.8). DISCUSSION Demographic data from this study indicat ed that the north Jackson moose herd may be limited by habitat quality or availa bility, and its effects on the survival and reproductive performance of adult females, more than predation by grizzly bears and wolves. However, my findings do not support the classic concept of density-dependence as a limiting factor for this population as proposed by Berger et al. (1999, 2001). Indices of moose density indicated that the north J ackson moose herd has been declining since the late 1980s (Chapter 1) a nd evidence from the current st udy suggested that continued population declines appear to be more likel y than a stable or increasing population ( = 0.972, 95% CI = 0.907-1.062). This indicated that the nutritional quality, rather than the availability, of habitat may be the most im portant determinant limiting population growth because a reduction in moose numbers, no matter the cause, should have resulted in increased physical condition and reproductiv e success if this population occupied productive habitat (Bowyer et al. 2005). Potential moose population declines may have occurred concurrently with a reduction in habitat quality, due to unidentified causes, which might explain the marginal nutritiona l condition (Chapter 3) and low reproductive output observed in the study population. Because my study was not designed to evaluate 132cause-specific m ortality, I could not rule out the potential additive effects of gray wolf or grizzly bear predation on adults and calves. But such effects, if present, appeared to be secondary to the influence of habitat quality possibly due to the abundance of alternate prey in the GYE. The pattern of adult female mortality in this study was indica tive of a population that is nutritionally limited. Consistent with other dem ographic studies of ungulates, adult female survival had the most significant influence on population growth, but contrary to these studies, there was high annual variation in survival rates (Gaillard et al. 2000) primarily due to variation in mortality during late winter and early spring (March- May). Increased spring mort ality was suggestive of hab itat limitations because the nutritional demands of female moose increase as winter progresses and peaks during late winter in association with pa rturition and lactation (Schwart z et al. 1984, Schwartz et al. 1987). Therefore, if the nutri tional demands of females were not met during this critical period or environmental factor s increase the energetic dema nds of locomotion and reduce the availability of forage, decreased survival may occur. Bender et al. (2007) observed increased spring mortality in a mule deer popul ation following a dry spring that reduced the availability of quality forage. Like wise, Modafferi and Becker (1997) observed decreased female moose survival in late wint er following years with heavy and persistent snow accumulation in Alaska. In the Jack son Valley, Houston (1968) suggested that moose populations fluctuated from 1950 to 1966 in response to willow conditions and periodic die-offs that occurred during severe winters. This indicated that moose in good physical condition were likely buffered against the effects of increased winter severity, whereas moose in poor physical condition were more susceptible (Bowyer et al. 2000). 133While this study was not designed to ev aluate cause-specifi c mortality, I did observe a relatively-high proporti on of deaths due to natural causes that were not related to predation (19%, see Figure 4.5) which was indicative of poor habi tat quality resulting in reduced physical condition. In other m oose populations where predation was found to be a significant mortality factor for adults, no deaths associat ed with natural causes were reported (Bergerud et al. 1983, Gasaway et al. 1992). Similar to other studies (Boertje et al. 1988, Larsen et al. 1989), I observed some spring grizzly bear predation on adult female moose, but a reduction in physical c ondition due to poor habitat quality may have predisposed moose to predator-re lated mortalities. Therefore, it is likely that if habitat quality were improved, the physical condition of moose would also improve which may result in increased survival rates. Although my modeling indicated that the Jackson moose population may be in a slow rate of decline ( = 0.973), consistent with trends since the late 1980s (Chapter 1), the low twinning rates observed during the study (see Table 4.1) indi cated that habitat quality had not improved as moose numbers declined. Moose twinning rates are used by managers as an indicator of the nutriti onal status of the population (Franzmann and Schwartz 1985, Boertje et al. 2007). Twinning rates have been reported to be as high as 70% for moose populations that occupy hi ghly productive habitat (Franzmann and Schwartz 1985) and as low as < 1% for moos e that occupy poor quality habitat (Albright and Keith 1987). When Shiras moose were expanding in the GYE during the early 20 th century, twins were more common than singl etons (Bailey 1930), but, in the Jackson Valley, twinning rates declined to approximately 15% by the 1940s (Denniston 1956) and were 4.5% in the 1960s (Houston 1968). High moose densities during the 1950s may 134have resulted in overutilizat ion of resources (Harry 1957) which may have reduced fem ale condition and, thus, twinning rates. The low twinning rates observed for this Shiras moose population may have been due to the relatively stable environments (i.e., lack of disturbances) that these moose inha bit (Peek 1974, Schwartz 1997). The lack of disturbance may result in high forage biomass, but that forage may be of low nutritional value. Additionally, twinning rates during this study were al so much lower than those observed for moose populations that appeared to be held at low densities by predation in Alaska (range 39-63%; Ballard et al. 1991, Osborne et al. 1991, Gasaway et al. 1992, Bertram and Vivion 2002) and Canada (54%; Bergerud et al. 1983) which again suggested nutritional constraints that limit reproductive output in this population. There appeared to be a low probability (0.33) that unhandled moose in the study population would be observed with a calf in co nsecutive years, which was indicative of nutritional limitations that may have result ed in reproductive pa uses. Successful reproduction in ungulates is highly depende nt on maternal condition and, in turn, maternal condition may be affected by habita t quality and past reproductive performance (Clutton-Brock et al. 1983, Testa and Adams 1998, Keech et al. 2000, Reynolds 2001). Thus, if habitat quality in th e study area was inadequate to support both lactation and fat accretion in consecutive years, successful reproduction may have been compromised (Clutton-Brock et al. 1983, Cook et al. 2004 a). Reproductive pauses (whether caused by an inability to conceive, lost pregnancy, or neonatal calf mortality) may benefit this moose population by allowing the female to accr ue sufficient body fat to produce a viable offspring that has a greater chance of surv ival the following year (Cameron et al. 1993, Testa 1998, Testa and Adams 1998, Keech et al . 2000). Similar to the current study, a 135low percentage (18%) of consecutive-year calf production was observed for a population of moose in Newfoundland, Canada affected by poor winter nutrition and severe winter weather. Addition ally, Reynolds (2001) observed an increased reproductive interval (from 1 to every 2-3 years) in musk-oxen ( Ovibos moschatus ) resulting from increased densities that likely affected forage. Although direct comparisons cannot be made, Cameron (1994) observed a 24% frequency of reproductive pauses in caribou and Clutton-Brock (1983) observed lower calf production in red deer the year following successful reproduction (68.9%) than in year s following failed reproduction (89.5%). The mechanisms responsible for the decr eased reproductive success of pregnant female moose captured during winter may ha ve been related to marginal physical condition more than capture and handling techniques. The observed difference in parturition rates between handl ed (24%) and unhandled female s (79%) as well as the high proportion of females known to be pregnant at ca pture that lost their fetuses at some point 1-2 months post-capture (79%) was so mewhat unique among documented moose captures. My findings contrast with t hose from an expanding moose population in southeast Wyoming where 9 pregnant adult fe male moose were captured 2 months prior to the current study using the same immobilization techniques, but 8 were observed with calves the following summer (E. Wald, University of Wyoming, personal communication). My results also contrasted with findings by Larsen and Gauthier (1989) who reported no decrease in parturition rate s when moose were captured during late pregnancy. Only one other study documented significantly lower parturition rates for mammals captured during winter and this occu rred in moose from Alaska (Ballard and Tobey 1981). The authors suggested that stre ss associated with immobilization without 136the use of a tranquilizer may have increased the incidence of fetal mortality. Although fe male moose handled during the first year of the study did not exhibit signs of capture- related stress (Kreeger et al. 2005), hand ling moose appeared to artificially induce a reproductive pause regardless of the immobilizin g agent or capture technique. Indeed, for moose that were captured and lost their calf, there was a high pr obability (0.80) that they would be observed with a calf the following year after not being handled. It has been posited that moose may be highly suscep tible to nutritional de ficiencies (Murray et al. 2006), thus, the combination of capture and marginal physical condition with deficiencies in several nutrients (Chapter 3) may have pushed moose over a physiological threshold that induced the reproductive pause po st-capture. The reduced reproductive success observed in the study population indicated that a reduction in the physical condition of adu lt females as winter progressed may have contributed to a concurrent reduction in reproduct ive output. Contrary to previous research (Berger et al. 1999), the obser ved pregnancy rate for moose (92%) was relatively high when compared to the North American average (84%; Boer et al. 1992) while the mean parturition rate (79% for unhandled moose) was on the lower end of the distribution (range = 75- 90%; Stenhouse et al. 1995, Keech et al. 2000, Testa 2004, Berger et al. 2007, Boertje et al. 2007). Although female moose with high body fat are more likely to become pregnant (Heard et al. 1997, Testa and Adams 1998, Keech et al. 2000) pregnancy rates appear to be relatively constant across a range of geographic areas, population densities, and environmental conditio ns (Edwards and Ritcey 1958, Boer et al. 1992). Therefore, high pregnancy rates may onl y indicate that moos e had sufficient body fat during the breeding season to become pregnant (Cook et al. 2004 a, Cook et al. 1372004 b). However, the nutritional deficiencies observed in the study population indicated that moose may have a higher fat-fertility th reshold than other populations (Heard et al. 1997, Chapter 3) and if the lower limit of this threshold was reached prior to parturition, there may be a greater potential for aborti on or resorption. Indeed, during spring 2008 (i.e., BY 2007), WGFD personnel responded to 2 separate instances of female moose aborting calves and a third cow that died while aborting a calf near the town of Jackson, Wyoming (S. Kilpatrick, WGFD, personal communication). The high neonate (62%) and annual calf su rvival (46%) rate s indicated that predation pressure on moose calves was rela tively low. This may be due to the abundance of alternate prey available in the GYE. Mattson (1997) reported that elk calves were used more than expected by griz zly bears in the GYE while both black bears and grizzly bears were significan t predators of neonatal elk calves before (Smith et al. 2006) and after (Barber-Meyer et al. 2008) wo lf restoration. Si nce elk calving grounds contain a relatively high abundance of animals, and the potential nutritional rewards are high, bears may prefer to forage near th ese areas during calving season (French and French 1990). In contrast, moose are solit ary by nature, thus th e potential nutritional reward may be less because of the greater search time that might be required by bears to locate moose calves. The high neonate surviv al and the abundance of alternate prey suggest that bear predation on neonatal moos e calves may be more opportunistic (Zager and Beecham 2006). Cougar (Ross and Jalkotzy 1996) and wolf predation (Larsen et al. 1989) on moose calves generally occurs after th e neonate life stage. The impact of these predators on calf survival appeared to be minimal based on the proportion of potential mortalities that occurred between neonate and annual calf su rvival surveys ( 0.16). 138Using comparable data where predation on ca lv es was a primary source of mortality, neonate survival ranged from 17-39% in Alas ka (Ballard et al. 1990, Ballard et al. 1991, Gasaway et al. 1992, Bowyer et al. 1998, Testa et al. 2000, Bertram and Vivion 2002) and Canada (Larsen et al. 1989). Not surprisi ngly, annual calf survival was also higher than observations from Alaska where rate s ranged from 13-33% (Ballard et al. 1991, Osborne et al. 1991, Gasaway et al. 1992, Testa et al. 2000, Bertram and Vivion 2002), but it was similar to a low-density moose population in Canada where some calf predation occurred (44%; Stenhouse et al. 1995) and a high-density population that was influenced primarily by density-dependent proces ses in Alaska (53%; Keech et al. 2000). Although wolves did account for some adult female moose mortalities, the effect of wolf predation on this populat ion appeared to be minimal. This may have been due to the abundance of alternate prey, specifically elk, in the study area. In a multipredator ecosystem in northwest Montana, adult fema le moose survival ra tes were higher where alternate ungulate prey were available (Kunkel and Pletscher 1999). Likewise, in Mantioba, Canada where elk and moose occu rred sympatrically, wolves preferred elk disproportionately more than moose (C arbyn 1983). In the Jackson Valley, elk represented > 90% of wolf kills (Jimenez et al. 2008), which indicated a similar trend. The apparent preference for elk by wolves in the GYE was likely due to the greater abundance of elk in the area. To reduce the potential effects of predation on moose and other large ungulates, wolves were selected for reintroduction from source populations where elk or deer were the primary prey (Bangs and Fritts 1996). When harvest was included in survival analyses, adult male survival appeared to decline in autumn, but survival exhibited no specific temporal patterns when harvest was 139censored. The lack of a temporal pattern of m ale mortality suggested that males were able to acquire sufficient forage prior to the onset of wint er to recoup losses incurred during autumn rut (Modafferi and Becker 1997). Non-harvest related survival rates were similar to those observed for males in Co lorado (Olterman and Kenvin 1998) and Alaska (Modafferi and Becker 1997). When all forms of mortality were included, male survival was slightly higher than a m oose population in Alaska wher e vulnerability to harvest increased with age (Ballard et al. 1991), but was much greater than a population in Newfoundland, Canada where harvest was heav ily biased towards males (Albright and Kieth 1987). Although evidence indicated that a d eclining moose population was more probable than a stable or in creasing population in the study area, caution should be used when interpreting the finite ra te of growth. All yearling i nput parameters were estimated from previous research and I assumed that parturition rates for unhandled moose were representative of the population. Boer (1992) reported that twinning rates were significantly correlated with the proportion of pregnant yearlings in a population. Yearling pregnancy rates were estimated for the study population based on work conducted in the Jackson Valley by Houston (1968). Twinning ra tes during my study were similar to those observed by Houston (1968), thus I assumed that yearling pregnancy was also similar and that the estim ated yearling fecundity rate may be fairly accurate. Even though it was assumed that yearling survival equaled adult survival, several studies have reported that yearling survival was lower than adults (Dodge et al. 2004, Testa 2004, Murray et al. 2006). Therefor e, my estimate of population growth may have been biased high. Furthermore, although parturition rate estimat es were consistent 140across years for the handled and unhandled gr oups of moose, neona tal calf losses that may have oc curred prior to parturition su rveys would have biased my parturition estimates low and my annual calf survival es timates high. Based on the accuracy of fecal progestagen in predicting whet her a female would be observed with a calf in the spring (see Figure 4.3), the introducti on of bias associated with unrecorded neonatal losses appeared to be minimal and likely had little e ffect on my estimates of annual calf survival and population growth. Additional moose research in northwest Wyoming could be used to further assess the nutritional status of the population. In addition to multi-year twinning rates that average < 10%, Boertje et al . (2007) suggested that the nutritional stat us of moose populations could be evaluated by obtaining short-yearling (i.e ., a moose that has almost completed its first year of life) mass, ag e of first reproduction, and annual browse biomass removal rates. Alt hough the value of using criteri a developed in Alaska to assess the nutritional conditi on of Shiras moose populations based on short-yearling mass may be limited due to differences in body size among species, radio-collaring short- yearling female moose would provide an accurate estimate of the age of first reproduction. It would also provide estimates of survival for the y earling age class and a measure of yearling reproductive success that coul d be used to more accurately assess the finite rate of growth. Efforts to assess th e condition of moose wint er ranges may assist managers in evaluating the quality of the habi tat. In addition to research that could provide more insight into the nutritional status of the populat ion, increased monitoring to estimate cause-specific mortality for adult fema le moose, especially in the spring, would 141be an important step to further evaluate th e extent of potential lim iting factors resulting from predation and other causes. MANAGEMENT IMPLICATIONS The low reproductive potential and decrea sed spring survival of adult female moose in this population indicated that habita t may be the primary limiting factor in the study area. Therefore, populati on and habitat management strategies designed to increase the quality of moose habitat could be evaluated relative to their impacts on reproductive output and survival of adult females (Bende r et al. 2007). Although this population may be in decline, increased reproductive output a nd female survival may not be realized until a disturbance (i.e., fire, mechanical treatment) acts to improve the quality of moose winter range. Habitat improvement projects could be completed on a large-scale over multiple years so that high numbers of moose do not reduce the growth potential of preferred forage and the amount of available forage remains sufficient even during high snow years. Improvements to moose summer ranges may be limited in scope because much of the area is managed as a naturally re gulated system by the U.S. Forest Service and the National Park Service. Mature conife rous forests are an important component of Shiras moose habitat selection in winter (Tyers 2003) and summer (Chapter 2), thus disturbances that reduce the amount of mature forests (i.e., wildfires, insect outbreaks) could negatively affect moose population performance. Therefore, large-scale disturbances and their pote ntial impacts on moose population dynamics could be closely monitored. 142Although most elk use feedgrounds (B oyce 1989, Lubow and Smith 2004), there are relatively high numbers of free-ranging elk in the Jackson Valley th at also utilize moose winter ranges and during periods of heavy and persistent snow accumulation, elk may compete with moose for browse (Mil ler 2002). Increasi ng elk harvest and improving elk winter ranges may reduce the comp etitive interactions of these species. However, caution should be used if elk harv est is increased to a lleviate some of the competitive pressure because a reduction in elk numbers on winter range may increase the impact of predators on moose (Gasaw ay et al. 1983, Ballard and Larsen 1987, Kunkel and Pletscher 1999) potentially creating a pred ator-pit scenario. Managing wildlife populations in ecosystems that contain multiple prey and predators is a highly-complex endeavor that requires active management and long-term research to make informed decisions. By closely examining long-term demographic data in relati on to interactions with other ungulates, predators, habitat, and environmental factors, managers and researchers can gain a better understanding of ecosystem dynamics. Nonetheless, this study provided a framework with which future research can now be directed to answer more cause-specific questions regarding the dyn amics of moose in northwest Wyoming. 143LITERATURE CITED Albright, C.

Shiras moose ( A.a. shirasi ) in northwest Wyoming appeared to follow a similar pattern and selected low-elevation, riparian habitats dominated by willow ( Salix spp.) communities. In Alaska, aspen ( Populus tremuloides ) ranked as the highest quality winter forage (Oldemeyer et al. 1977), thus selection for aspen indicated that moose not only preferred habitats with high forage biomass, but they also selected for the highest quality browse available during winter. Moose also selected for areas with high habitat diversity which indicated that they require a variety of resources to meet their nutritional and energetic requirements during winter. I observed little evidence to support a shift to more closed- canopy habitats as winter progr essed, but winter range cond itions may not have been severe enough to necessitate selection for coniferous habitats during late winter (Poole and Stuart-Smith 2006). Summer habitat selection by adult female moose in the study area appeared to be associated with habitat and landscape features that limited the effects of thermal stress. Areas classified as high-use during summer were > 300 m higher in elevation and > 100 m closer to cover than areas classified as hi gh-use in winter. Sel ection for habitats in close proximity to cover may have provided refugia from high summer temperatures that typically exceeded the heat stress threshold for moose. Although my data do not prove 168that mature coniferous forests are critical for moose survival during summ er (Balsom et al. 1996), they do lend support to the notion that these habitats are important in providing cover and reducing the potential effects of heat stress near the southern extent of their range. Moose exhibited a high degree of individual variability in the onset of spring and autumn migrations. In general, there wa s a relationship between the onset of spring migration and the elevation of summer ra nges in 2006 which i ndicated that snow conditions may be a factor in the timing of migration in some years. There was no relationship between autumn migration a nd the elevation of summer range which indicated that a rapid accumulation of snow initiated migration regardless of summer range elevation. Photoperiod may also affect the timing of migratory events in the study population (Garrott et al. 1987). Based on comparisons of blood parameters compiled for Alaskan moose ( A.a. gigas ; Franzmann and LeResche 1978), adult fema le moose in the study area appeared to be in moderate physical condi tion. Ultrasonic rump fat me asurements were relatively high, but there was evidence that moose winter forage was deficient in copper, zinc, manganese, and phosphorous. Because of nutri tional deficiencies, the study population may require greater fat depths than other moose populations to maximize reproductive potential (Heard 1997). Rump fat levels indicated that moose were able to obtain sufficient quantities of forage, but these resources were not of th e highest quality. I observed a significant negative relationship between rump fat levels and two blood parameters, aspartate aminotransferase a nd lactate dehydrogenase. Both of these parameters are indicators of muscle and organ damage generally associated with 169exertional myopathy (EM; William s and Thorne 1996), however, concentrations were not indicative of EM. The negative relationships that I observed were consistent with increased utilization of body prot eins as lipid reserv es decline in lean animals. Diseases and parasites appeared to have minimal populat ion-level effects. However, the impacts of the winter tick ( Dermacentor albipictus ) may increase in years following warm, dry springs. The north Jackson moose herd appears to have been declining since the late 1980s based on indices of moose density (Chapter 1) and modeling efforts from my study indicated that a dec lining population was more likely than a stable or increasing population. The population growth rate was influenced by late wint er and early spring adult female mortality. Although increased pr edation may have par tially contributed to the observed decline, its influence was likel y limited by the abundance of alternate prey, specifically elk ( Cervus elaphus ), in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Additionally, the study population exhibited low reproductive potential in the form of low twinning rates, reproductive pauses, and relatively low pa rturition rates. This indicated that the nutritional quality of available forage may be the most important determinant in limiting population growth because a reduction in moose numbers over a 20-year period, no matter the cause, should have resulted in increased physical condition and reproductive success (Bowyer et al. 2005). Moose populations may have slowly declined in response to gradually declini ng habitat quality over this time period. In addition to the 1988 Yellowstone fires and its effect on moose summer ranges, another explanation for the declining popul ation performance with reduced moose numbers could be drought and climate change (Murray et al. 2006). Although a loss of 170vigor and even death has been observed due to drought in a riparian tree species from eastern Montana, the plains cottonwood ( P. deltoides ; Knight 1994), to my knowledge, no work has been conducted to examine the effects of drought on the growth potential and nutritional quality of riparian vegetation in the Intermountain West. In northwest Wyoming, there has been a series of relativ ely mild winters and dry summers since the 1990s, and if the nutritional quality of ripari an vegetation preferred by moose was altered due to drought, this may have had a negativ e effect on the physical condition and overall population performance of the north Jacks on moose herd. While habitat quality and its effects on the physical condition, survival, and reproductive success of adult female moose a ppeared to be the primary factor limiting population growth, I cannot discount the potential effects of predation. Although evaluating cause-specific mortality was not a primary objective during this study, grizzly bears ( Ursus arctos ) and gray lupus ) were responsible for some mortalities. However, a relatively high proporti on of deaths were attributed to natural causes not related to predation which suggested that predation pressure was insufficient to account for the nutritional limitations of the habitat. Management Implications Shiras moose population declines in north west Wyoming began shortly after the 1988 Yellowstone fires (Chapter 1) and moose selection for ar eas in close proximity to coniferous cover indicated that a reduction in this habitat feature may have been detrimental to moose. Similar patterns were observed on the northern Yellowstone winter range after the 1988 w ildfires (Tyers 2003). A reduc tion in coniferous cover on 171summer range may have reduced the am ount of available forage and increased thermal stress that, ultimately, resulted in reduced physical condition and lower reproductive potential. The continued threat of disturbances (i.e., wildfires, insect outbreaks) that have the potential to greatly reduce the availability of coniferous forests may negatively affect moose populations near the southern extent of their range. Because much of the summer range used by moose in northwest Wyoming is managed for natural regulation, little can be done to improve these habitats. Therefore, continued monitoring of moose populations and the potential effects of reduced coniferous co ver appear warranted. Although winter range habitat improvement s occurred during the early 1990s in the Jackson Valley, these were relatively small in scale. Thus, improvements in fitness may only have been observed at the individu al rather than the population-level. To benefit moose at the population-level, la rge-scale improvement projects could be initiated. However, because of differences in management strategies among state and federal agencies in the Jackson Valley, this ma y be a difficult task. Nonetheless, through cooperation and planning, efforts to improve moose winter ranges on a large-scale could be implemented. Prescribed burns or mechani cal treatment of preferred riparian shrubs would improve growth as well as the nutr itive value of forage for moose and other ungulates. Aspen was also an important com ponent of moose winter range and projects that encourage growth and regeneration could benefit this population. Habitat improvements would likely lead to improved herd health and may result in increased adult female survival, reproductive success, and population growth. 172Future Research Given insights from this study, future rese arch can be directed to answer more specific questions in regards to the ec ology and dynamics of m oose populations in northwest Wyoming. Global pos itioning system collars could be used to further assess the importance of coniferous cover for moose on summer ranges by examining habitat selection patterns between da y and night. If thermal stress during summer influences habitat selection, one would expect to see mo re use of coniferous cover during the day when temperatures are high and less use duri ng night (Muir 2006). This could also be evaluated during late winter and early spring because moose may select habitats that reduce thermal stress as spring temperatures increase. Alth ough the predictive- probability-of-use map provided a framework to estimate where moose are most likely to be located during winter, it did not take into account environm ental factors such as snow depths or ambient temperatures. Some areas classified as high-use during winter may not support moose because of greater snow depths than what occurs in the Buffalo Valley. This would greatly reduce the av ailability of forage and incr ease the energetic cost of locomotion which would likely result in reduced physical condition. Areas in and around Pacific Creek in Grand Teton National Park may n eed to be reassessed due to this factor. Further evaluation of the physiologica l health of this population appears warranted. By evaluating blood parameters in relation to individual habitat selection patterns, researchers may have a clearer pict ure of habitat compone nts that could reduce moose fitness. Continued eval uation of blood parameters that are correlated with rump fat depth may provide managers with an easy assessment of physical condition without the need for an ultrasound. Rump fat depths or blood parameters can be used to assess 173the health of moose herds st atewide by collecting this inf ormation at check stations during the autumn. This would provide managers with a relative index of the nutritional status of moose populations entering winter. This information could also be used to assess fat catabolism as a function of winter se verity or reproductive status if moose were to be captured again during mid to late wint er. To gain a better understanding of the relationship and utilization ra tes between protein and fat re serves during winter, I would strongly recommend using ultr asonography to measure the th ickness of specific muscles from captured moose (Cook et al. 2001). Pref erably, this would be accomplished at the beginning and near the end of each winter season so that accurate assessments of utilization rates could be c onducted. Nutritional deficienci es are best examined through direct evaluation of the mineral content of forage (McDowell 2003). Therefore, future research could assess the mineral content of preferred moose forage, both during winter and summer. This could also provide informa tion that may be used to assess the potential effects of drought and climate change on moose browse in the Jackson Valley. Furthermore, estimating annual browse biomass removal rates could provide an additional assessment of the nut ritional status of this popul ation. Boertje et al. (2007) suggested that, in addition to multi-year twinning rates < 10%, annual browse biomass removal rates of > 35% may be indicative of low nutritional status of a moose population. Long-term studies of the dynamics of this moose population appear warranted. Because of the reduced parturition rates of moose captured during this study, capturing and radio-collaring a large sample of moose at once, then no t handling them again for the duration of the study, could provide estimates of survival and reproductive success over a very long time period. This could be used to further assess the re productive output (i.e., 174parturition rates, twinning rates, reproductive pauses) of this population on an annual basis by removing capture ef fects completely. Additionally, capturing a sample of short- yearlings over the course of 2-3 years coul d be used to estimate yearling survival and parturition rates as well as th e age of first reproduction. Ye arling survival and parturition rates could be used to estimate more accurate ly the growth rate of this population. The age of first reproduction could be used to ev aluate further the nutri tional status of the population (Boertje et al. 2007). More effort could be made to estimat e cause-specific mortality and further evaluate the potential effects of grizzly b ear and gray wolf predation as well as the impacts of condition in predisposing moose to predator-related mortality. Although I used a simple technique to evaluate condition at time of death, it did not appear to be very useful because it was too general. Colle cting marrow samples and evaluating percent marrow fat would be a better assessment of condition at time of death (Neiland 1970, Ballard 1995). Increasing the frequency of aerial relocations, esp ecially during spring, could expedite the ability of researchers to determine cause of deat h prior to significant scavenging. Bear sign was evident at mortal ity sites, but there was an insufficient amount of moose remains to determine cause-s pecific mortality. Thus, in many cases, I was unable to determine if the moose died due to some other factor pr ior to the arrival of the bear or if the bear was the proximate cause of death. 175LITERATURE CITED Ballard, W.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to provide the Wy oming Department of Transportation (WYDOT) and the Wyoming Game and Fish Department (WGFD) with information that could be used to assess the importance of habitat, landscape, and anthropogenic features that are essentia l determinants in evaluating moose crossing locations in northwest Wyoming. Approximately 30 moose were captured, tr anquilized, and collared using global positioni ng system (GPS) collars. The collars were programmed to provide a fix every hour from 15 November to 15 June, and every five hours from 16 June to 14 November. The results of this study demonstrated that models developed to assess adult female moose winter habitat selection could be use d at a finer spatial scale to accurately id entify areas where moose are most likely to cross U.S. Highway 26/287 in the Buffalo Valley. The moose crossing events were not randomly distributed, but occurred at predictable loca tions that could be estimated by examining winter habitat selection parameters that co ntained an abundance of forage provided by aspen and willow- dominated, riparian habitats, on either side of the road.

EXECUTIVE SUMM ARY To accommodate rises in traffic volume a nd to address highway safety concerns, transportation managers often need to expa nd existing travel corridors which may result in an increased risk of wildlife-vehicle coll isions. Wildlife-vehicle collisions are not random events and appear to be related to the daily and seasonal activity patterns of animals. By examining the spatial and tem poral patterns of wildlife crossings, managers can apply appropriate mitigation to reduce collision risk and maintain highway safety. The U.S. Highway 26/287 reconstruction projec t provided an opportunity to examine the influence of habitat, landscape, and man-ma de features that determine moose crossing locations in northwest Wyoming. A previous model developed to assess moose winter habitat selection was used at a smaller spat ial scale to determine if it could accurately identify moose crossing locations along a 9.7 km (6.0-mi) section of U.S. Highway 26/287 that bisects a high-density moose wint er range in the Buffalo Fork Valley. We used an independent sample of moose crossing locations to validate the predictive highway crossing map. We also examined te mporal patterns of moose crossings and the influence of fence types. The predictive map indicated that areas cl assified as high or medium-high predicted probabilities of use occurre d between mileposts 3.2-4.5, 6.1- 6.7, and 7.0-9.0. These areas were characterized by a high proportion of aspen and ripa rian/deciduous shrub habitat with little coniferous cover, low elevation, relatively flat slope, and moderate distance to cover. Of the 201 moose crossings recorded from the independent sample, 81% ( n = 162) occurred in high to medium-high probabi lity of use areas. Moose used high-use areas more than expected, medium-high and medium-low use areas as expected, and low- use areas less than expected. Although we we re unable to directly measure the use of the Buffalo Fork and Blackrock Creek bridges, m ileposts on either side of these structures were classified as high-use areas which s uggest a high likelihood that moose utilized these structures to cross U.S. Highway 26/287. Moose crossed the highway more than expected during afternoon to early evening and less than ex pected during mid-day. A high proportion of fencing occurred along private lands adjacent to the highway that were not preferred moose habitat, th erefore, moose crossed the highway more than expected in areas that contained no fencing and less than expected in area s that contained fencing. Fencing along the highway was not constr ucted to prevent moose movements and preferred habitat and landscape features appear ed to have more influence in determining crossing locations than th e presence of fencing. Because aggregations of moose crossings occurr ed at predictable locations and the risk of collisions were highest during periods of lim ited visibility, managers could reduce speed limits and erect temporary warning signs duri ng winter in areas cl assified as high and medium-high predicted probabilit ies of use to warn motorists of the increased risk of encountering a moose on the highway. Du e to the low number of moose-vehicle collisions during this study ( n = 1), major and costly mitigation may not be justified in the Buffalo Fork Valley unless collisions increase following highw ay reconstruction. Lengthening existing bridges over rivers and streams may facilitate animal movements 185 under these structures. Moose are not the on ly animals that inhabit the Buffalo Fork Valley, thus, m anagers could develop mitigation to benefit multiple species while continuing to maintain motorist safety. 186 TABLE OF CONTENTS CHAPTER 1.

This can lead to sharp increases in the number of wildlife-vehi cle collisions (McDonald 1991, Oosenbrug et al. Groot Bruinderink and Hazebroek 1996, Farrell a nd Tappe 2007). In the United States, Conover et al. (1995) estimated that approximately 726,000 deer ( Odocoileus spp.)- vehicle collisions occurred in 1991 resulting in an estimated 211 human fatalities. In 1991, deer-vehicle collisions cost an estimated $1,500 (U.S .) per accident and human injuries occurred in approximately 4% of collisions (Conover et al. 1995). Because not all accidents are reported, the actual number of deer-vehicle collisions may be much higher (Conover et al. 1995). When collisions occur with larger animals (i.e., moose [ Alces alces ]), the risk of human injury and increased property damage rises significantly (Joyce and Mahoney 2001). Methods to reduc e wildlife-vehicle collisions have had mixed results. Mitigation to reduce the number of collisions or prevent animals from entering the roadway (i.e., roadside clearing, fencing, overpasses and underpasses) appear to be the most effective, but maintenance and repair costs often limit their implementation (Bashore et al. 1985 , Feldhammer et al. 1986). Wildlife-vehicle collisions can rarely be asso ciated with a single factor, but the spatial and temporal patterns of accidents are not rando m events and appear to be related to daily and seasonal activity patterns of animals (Bashore et al. 1985, Belant 1995, Waller and Servheen 2005). In addition, traffic volume, speed limits, driver awareness, and weather conditions have been implicated as influe ncing the risk of collisions (Lavsund and Sandegren 1991, Modafferi 1991, Joyce a nd Mahoney 2001, Seiler 2005). Numerous studies have used modeling approaches to id entify habitat, landscap e, and anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) features that predict hi gh collision risk areas (Hubbard et al. 2000, Nielsen et al. 2003, Malo et al. 2004, Seiler 2005, Dussault et al. 2007). These models aid managers in determining where animal tr avel corridors occur and where appropriate mitigation can be applied so that collision risk is reduced and habitat linkages are maintained (Clevenger et al. 2002, Ng et al. 2004, Kindall and Van Manen 2007). Most studies of wildlife-vehicle collisions examined habitat and landscape characteristics once the frequency of accidents became soci ally unacceptable. Many roads in North America bisect important seasonal ranges of ungulates where few collisions have recently occurred, but the importance of identifying areas of potential increased collision risk can be valuable in addressing possible problem lo cations before they become chronic. By examining spatial and temporal patterns of animal movements associated with a roadway, proactive engineering can be implemented in to existing roadway design or incorporated into the design phase of proposed highway reconstruction projects to reduce the chances that wildlife-vehicle collisions will r each a socially unacceptable level (Groot Bruinderink and Hazebroek 1996, Finder et al. 1999). The U.S. Highway 26/287 reconstruction project from Moran Junction to Dubois, Wyoming (Young and Sawyer 2006) is an example where mitigation can be incorporated in to the design phase. A portion of this highway bisects a high-density moose winter range in the Buffalo Fork Valley (Houston 1968, Brimeyer and Thomas 2004) in northwest Wyoming. Core moose crossing areas have been identifi ed by snow-track surveys in the Buffalo Fork section of the U.S. Highway 26/287 reconstruction project (Young and Sawyer 2006). However, the influence of habitat, landscape, and anthr opogenic features in determining crossing locations has not been investigated. We used global positioning system (GPS) collars to collect fine scale movement data for adult ( 2 years) female moose that winter adjacent to U.S. Highway 26/287 in the Buffalo Fork Valley during winter 2005-2007. Using habita t and landscape vari ables that were deemed important predictors of winter habitat use, we devel oped a model to estimate habitat selection by adult female moose over the entire winter range (Chapter 2). We us ed this model at a smaller spatial scale to determine whether winter habitat selection patterns of moose could accurately identify crossing locations by moose along a 9.7-km (6.0-mi) section of U.S. Highway 26/287 that bisects winter range in the Buffalo Fork Valley. We also examined temporal patterns of moose crossing events and the influence of fence type in determining crossing locations. 191 CHAPTER 2 OBJECTIVES The purpose of this study was to provide the Wyoming Departm ent of Transportation (WYDOT) and the Wyoming Game and Fish De partment (WGFD) with information that could be used to assess the importance of ha bitat, landscape, and anthropogenic features that are essential determinants in evalua ting moose crossing locations in northwest Wyoming. The results will assist WYDOT in identifying, evaluating, and implementing highway designs and mitigation that improve safety to moose and motorists by reducing the risk of moose-vehicle collisions while maintaining highway permeability for moose. With an improved understanding of the spatia l and temporal charac teristics of moose crossings, a more efficient approach to m itigation can be applied to future highway redevelopment projects. The primary objective of this study was to ap ply a model developed to estimate winter habitat selection by adult female moose to a 9.7-km (6.0-mi) stretch of U.S. Highway 26/287 in the Buffalo Fork Valley to determine if the model could be used to accurately identify crossing locations for a migratory moose population that winters adjacent to the highway. We also quantified the influence of fence types associated with moose crossing events and estimated the frequency and tim ing of crossings that occurred along U.S. Highway 26/287 and U.S. Highway 26/89/187 du ring the study period. To formally address the above objectives, we tested the following hypotheses: (1) moose crossing events are randomly distributed and occur in equal proportions throughout the day, (2) the location of moose crossings occur in e qual proportion to the pr edicted probability of use (i.e., preferred habitat) within the highway study area, and (3) fence types are crossed in proportion to availability by moose. 192 This page is intentionally left blank. 193 CHAPTER 3 TASK DES CRIPTION Study Area The study area was located about 50 km (30 mi ) north of the town of Jackson, Wyoming and encompassed approximately 1,100 km 2 (425 mi2; Chapter 2) of predominately public land in northwest Wyoming (Figure 1). It wa s defined by the winter distribution of GPS- collared adult female moose (C hapter 2) and included porti ons of Grand Teton National Park (GTNP) and Bridger-Teton National Forest (BTNF). Primary moose winter ranges occurred along the Buffalo Fork River, the Snake River, and Pacific Creek. Major roads within the study area included U.S. Highway 26/287, U.S. Highway 26/89/187, and U.S. Highway 89/287 (Figure 1). All were two-lane highways with speed limits ranging from 88 km/h (55 mi/h) in GTNP to 105 km/h (65 mi/h) outside of Park boundaries. From January 2005 to December 2007, mean daily traf fic was estimated to be 952 vehicles/day along U.S. Highway 26/287 with a peak in tr affic volume occurring during the tourist season from June through Se ptember (WYDOT 2006, 2007, 2008). Figure 1 . Study area in northwest Wyoming defi ned by the winter distribution of GPS- collared adult female moose ( n = 22), 2005-2007. Vegetation types occur along an elevati onal gradient (Whitlock 1993, Knight 1994) within the study area. L ower elevations and many south-facing slopes at higher elevations are dominated by big sagebrush ( Artemisia tridentata ). Mid-elevations contorta ) found on north slopes and more mesic sites at lower elevations. Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, and lodgepole pine intermixed dominate higher elevations. Alpine tundra occu rs at the highest elevations while open forest parks and s ubalpine meadows dominated by grasses and forbs (i.e., flowering plants) occur at all el evations. Riparian areas are dominated by occur in large, flooplain environments at lo wer elevations and along nearly all streams within the study area (Wiggl esworth and Wachob 2004). The climate is characterized by short, cool summers and cold winters. From 1975-2004, annual precipitation averaged 56.2 cm (22.1 in; range 79.1 cm [31.1 in]; http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/Timeseries/timeseries1.pl; accessed 16 October 2005), but most of the annual precipitation fa lls as snow between November and May. The Teton Mountains to the west and th e northern highlands along the Yellowstone National Park (YNP) boundary typically rece ive the greatest amounts of precipitation (Houston 1968, Cole 1969, Boyce 1989). Moose Captures and Data Management Adult female moose were captured from a helicopter on winter range in the Buffalo Fork Valley of northwest Wyoming during Februa ry 2005 and 2006. Moose were darted and immobilized with 10-mg thiafentanil oxala te (A-3080, Wildlife Pharmaceuticals, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA; McJames et al. 1994, Ar nemo et al. 2003, Kreeger et al. 2005). Once handling was completed, thiafentanil was antagonized with an intramuscular injection of 300-mg naltrexone (Trexonil, Wildlife Pharmaceuticals, Fort Collins, Colorado, USA). All captured moose were fitted with TGW- 3700 GPS collars with store-on-board technology (Telonics, Mesa, Ar izona, USA) that were programmed to attempt a location fix every hour from 15 N ovember to 15 June and every 5 hours from 16 June to 14 November. Location data were collected until 1 March 2007 when the collars were programmed to release from the moose. Upon retrieval of GPS collars, location data were examined and all unsucce ssful fixes and obvious location errors were removed (D'Eon et al. 2002, D'Eon and Serrouy a 2005). Data were not corrected for fix- rate bias because of the high fix-rate succe ss observed (Chapter 2; D'Eon 2003, Friar et al. 2004, Hebblewhite et al. 2007). Three- dimensional fixes accounted for a high proportion of winter locations (Chapter 2), therefore, data were not differentially corrected because 3-dimensional locations ge nerally have < 20 m error (Di Orio et al. 2003). Captures were performed in accordan ce with approved Univ ersity of Wyoming Animal Care and Use Committee protocols. 195 Frequency and Timing of Highway Crossing Events To estimate the number of highway crossing ev ents during w inter within the study area, we mapped winter locations of moose from 2005 to 2007 in ArcMap 9.2 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, Ca lifornia, USA) and used the HOME RANGE TOOLS extension for ArcGIS (Rodgers et al. 2007) to create movement paths for each individual. We determined that a crossing occurred when the straight line between 2 consecutive locations crossed either U.S. Highway 26/287 or U.S. Highway 26/89/187. We did not investigate crossings that o ccurred along U.S. Highway 89/287 between Moran Junction and YNP because of limited traffic volume due to seasonal road closures within GTNP. Because winter locations were collected ever y hour, the timing of crossing events were estimated to have occurred within the time pe riod between 2 consecutive locations. The timing of moose crossings were grouped into 4 distinct time periods to reflect when moose-vehicle collisions were most likely to occur. These time periods were 0300 - 0859 hrs (early to mid-morning), 0900 - 1459 hrs (mid-day), 1500 - 2059 hrs (afternoon to early evening), and 2100 - 0259 hrs (night). A chi-square test ( P 0.05) was used to determine if crossing events occurred at random during each time period throughout the day. Predicting Moose Crossing Locations in the Buffalo Fork Valley To create the highway study area, we used a hand-held GPS unit to mark the location of mileposts 3 through 9 and plotted these in ArcGIS. We digitized a 9.7-km (6.0-mi) stretch of U.S. Highway 26/287 from a U. S. Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale digital orthophoto quarter quadrangle map and divi ded each 1.6-km (1.0-mi) section into 10 equal segments that represented secondary mile markers to the nearest 0.16-km (0.1-mi). The highway study area was defined as that area within a 1.5-km (0.9-mi) buffer around the highway, which represented the average da ily distance moved by ra dio-collared adult female moose during winter (Chapter 2). The final population-level model developed to estimate adult female moose winter habitat selection incl uded coefficients for the propor of riparian/deciduous shrub, mixed/other conifer, and aspen habitats, elevat ion, habitat diversity, slope, and distance to coniferous cover (Chapter 2). To measure th ese variables, we created circular sample units with 25-m (82-ft) radii that were systematically distribut ed across the highway study area. We extracted vegetation data from each sample unit with HAWTHs ANALYSIS TOOLS (Beyer 2004) and calculate d the proportion of each vegetation type that occurred within each unit. We used SPATIAL ANALYST to estimate slope from a 26 x 26-m digital elevation model (U.S. Geologi cal Survey 1999) and to create a distance to cover layer from the existing vegetation map. Cover was defined strictly as coniferous habitats that could potential ly provide thermal cover during winter. Estimates for elevation, slope, and distance to cover were ex tracted from the midpoint of each sample unit. We used 250-m (820-ft) radii circul ar units centered on the midpoint of each 196 sample unit to calculate a Shannon-Weiner habitat diversity index based on the proportion of spruce/fir, lodge pole pine, mixed/other conife r, aspen, riparian/deciduous shrub, and other habitat types that occurred within each circular sample unit. We used the R statistical software package (R Core Development Team 2006) to estimate resource selection probability functions (R SPF; Manly et al. 2002) for each sample unit using population-level coefficients developed to assess winter habitat selection by adult female moose (Table 1; Chapter 2). Th e RSPF predictions were mapped across 50 x 50- m pixels for the highway study ar ea. The RSPFs were assigned to 1 of 4 categories based on the quartiles of the distribu tion of predictions (Sawyer et al. 2006, Sawyer et al. 2007). Pixels were assigned values from 1 to 4 repr esenting the highest to lowest estimated use probabilities in 25% increments (i.e., highest use probability = 1 [highest 25%], lowest use probability = 4 [lowest 25%]). To determine the validity of the predictive map in delineating moose crossing locations in the highway study area, we used an independent sample of 201 cro ssing events collected during winter 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 that were recorded to the nearest 0.16-km (0.1-mi) marker (Young and Sawyer 2006). Since it was unknown exactly where the moose crossed the highway relative to the nearest mile marker, we created 80-m buffers around each 0.16-km (0.1-mi) marker and estimated an average RSPF class from all the predicted probability-of-use classes within each buffer. The 80-m buffer represented the mean probability-of-use for each mile marker given that a moose could have crossed anywhere within that buffer and still be classi fied as having crossed at the mile marker. Markers with mean RSPF classes from 1.00 to 1.50 were assigned to class 1 and were classified as high-use area s, markers with mean RSPF classes from 1.51 to 2.50 were assigned to class 2 and were classified as medium-high-use areas, markers with mean RSPF classes from 2.51 to 3.50 were assigned to class 3 and were classified as medium- low-use areas, and markers with classes fr om 3.51 to 4.00 were assigned to class 4 and were classified as low-use areas. We jo ined the RSPF class and the number of crossing events associated with each secondary mile marker from the independent sample and calculated the proportion of crossing events th at occurred within each RSPF class. We estimated a chi-square statistic ( P 0.05) for each RSPF class to determine if moose selected highway crossings associated with preferred habitat. Fence Types and Moose Crossings To determine if fence type influenced m oose movement across U.S. Highway 26/287 in the Buffalo Fork Valley, we created a GIS laye r that depicted three different fence types that occurred within the hi ghway study area: (1) bighorn fence, (2) four-strand, barbed wire fence, and (3) buck-and-rail fence. The bighorn fence was a two-pole, two-wire fence that stands approximately 1.1 m (43 in) in height (Figure 2). Sections of four- strand, barbed-wire fence were primarily located along stretches with permanent standing water. A small section of buck-and-rail fenc ing was located west of the GTNP boundary (Figure 3). No fencing occurred within GTNP, from the bridge over Blackrock Creek (milepost 8.45) to milepost 9 on the north side of the highway, and from mileposts 8 to 9 on the south side of the highway. 197 198 Because fence types differed on either side of the roadway in a number of locations, we examined the north and south side of the hi ghway separately then combined both sides for analysis. We assumed that the strai ght line used to depict moose movements accurately reflected the fence type that wa s crossed by moose. Only those crossing events that occurred between mileposts 3 and 9 were used to assess the possible effects of fence type. We used a chi-square test ( P 0.05) to estimate if moose crossed fences in proportion to what was expect ed throughout the study area. Table 1 .

A total of 257 crossing events were recorded with 19 moose crossing U.S. Hi ghway 26/287 or U.S. Highway 26/89/187 at some point during the study period. Only 8 moose crossed the highway 10 times and these moose accounted for 84% of all crossing events ( n = 217). Adult female moose crossed the highway more than expect ed during afternoon to early evening ( 2 = 10.32, df = 1, P = 0.001), less than expected during mid-day ( 2 = 18.26, df = 1, P < 0.001), and as expected during the night ( 2 = 0.52, df = 1, P = 0.473) and early to mid-morning (2 = 0.12, df = 1, P = 0.732; Table 2).

Private land encompassed approximately 11 km2 (4 mi2) with the remaining area managed by GTNP and BTNF. The predictive map indicated that areas classified as high or medium-high probabilities of use occurred between mileposts 3.2 and 4.5, 6.1 and 6.7, and 7.0 and 9.0 (Figure 5). These areas were characterized by a high proportion of aspen and riparian/deciduous shrub habitat with little coniferous cover, low elevation, relatively flat slope , and moderate distance to cover. Private land used for cattle and horse grazing occurred between mile markers 4.5 and 6.1, while private land held in conser vation easements occurred between mile markers 6.1 and 6.9. The predictive map indicated that moose were less likely to cross private land that was used for grazing, but we re more likely to cross on private land that was held in a conservation easement (Figure 5). Mileposts that occurre d on either side of the Buffalo Fork bridge and the Blackrock Cr eek bridge were each classified as high-use areas. This indicates a high lik elihood that moose may have u tilized bridges to cross U.S. Highway 26/287 because preferred hab itat occurred on either side. Figure 4 .

Relative predicted probabilities a nd associated categories (low = 0-25%, medium-low = 26-50%, medium-high = 51-75%, high = 76-100%) of habitat use for the highway study area developed from a model of winter habitat selection for adult female moose in northwest Wyoming during winter 2005-2007. Of the 201 moose crossings recorded from the independent sample, the highest proportion of crossing events occurred in areas classified as high or medium-high predicted probabilities of use (81%, n = 162), while fewer crossings occurred in areas classified as medium-low or low predicted probabilities of use (19%, n = 39; Table 3). Moose crossed the highway in areas categorized as high-use areas more than expected (2 = 6.92, df = 1, P = 0.009), as low-use areas less than expected ( 2 = 5.40, df = 1, P = 0.020), and in proportion to what wa s expected in medium-high-use ( 2 = 0.36, df = 1, P = 0.550) and medium-low-use ( 2 = 3.64, df = 1, P = 0.056) areas (Table 3). Although areas classified as medium-low were used approximately as exp ected, the actual number of crossings ( n = 22) were lower than the num ber of expected crossings ( n = 33). 202 Table 3.

Other studies portance of preferred habitat and landscape features in predicting ion risk for moose (Gundersen et al. 1998, Seiler 2005), elk Cervus elaphus ; Dodd et al. 2007), white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ; Carbaugh er et al . 1986, Finder et al. 1999, Hubbard et al. 2000), and black Ursus americanus ; Clevenger et al. 2002, Kindall and Van Manen 2007). Dussault the proportion of forage was greatest where moose crossed oose selected crossing locations that provided abundant snow accumulations during their study were e of the highest in the world (Dussault et al. 2007) a nd it has been well documented eases and the energetic cost of locomotion oose generally seek cover provided by mature undert mark et al. 1990, MacCracken et al. 1997, thern Sweden, snow depth infl uenced the availability of moose-vehicle collisions during winter and Alaska, a similar trend was observed ri 1991, Andreassen et al. 2005). In the ow accumulations may not have been severe enough to cause a opy coniferous fo rests. Additionally, the Buffalo Fork Valley and moose may have utilized tracks of other individuals o reduce the cost of locomotion in deep snow (Ball et al. 2001), thus crossing locations may be consistent am ong years even with varied degrees of winter se verity. Nonetheless, in years of deep snow, increased monitoring of moose crossing locations may be warranted to determine if there is a shift in preferred habitat and, consequently, highway crossing locations. Although moose crossings typically occurred in low elevation areas that contained a high proportion of aspen and riparian habitats, m oose selected for areas with high habitat diversity. This suggests that moose require a mix of riparian, aspen, and coniferous habitats to meet forage and cover requireme nts and that the distri bution of all habitat types across the landscape likely influenced th e probability that a cr ossing event occurred in a specific location. Priv ate lands used for grazing adjacent to the highway were composed primarily of herbaceous cover and cont ained little habitat di versity or preferred forage, thus very few moose crossings occurred in these areas. In contrast, private lands held in conservation easements were composed of a mix of riparian and coniferous habitats and, not surprisingly, moose use and crossing events associated with these areas were relatively high. Areas of high habitat diversity have also been implicated with the increased risk of vehicle collisions for white -tailed deer in Illinoi s (Finder et al. 1999), Iowa (Hubbard et al. 2000), and Minnesota (Nielsen et al. 2003) and roe deer ( Capriolus capriolus ), wild Cervus elaphus ) in Spain (Malo et al. 2004). However, in areas where preferred ha bitat is common and ha bitat diversity is relatively low, highway crossings, and thus wildlife-vehicle collisions, were more randomly distributed (Allen and McCullough 1976, Bashore et al. 1985, Feldhammer et al. 1986). Bridges over the Buffalo Fork River and Black rock Creek were both identified as having a high probability of use suggesting that m oose may utilize these structures to cross beneath the highway. Young and Sawyer (2006) documented and photographed several moose crossing the highway underneath these stru ctures. Bridges may facilitate wildlife crossings which could ultimately reduce the risk of wildlife-vehicle collisions along short sections of highway near these structures (Seiler 2004, Seiler 2005). However, Hubbard et al. (2000) indicated that br idges acted as \"major edge-cre ating landscape features\" that increased the risk of collisions with white-t ailed deer in Iowa. Furthermore, low to intermittent traffic volume caused a reduction in passage rates for elk using wildlife underpasses in Arizona that was possibly caused by the sudden a uditory and visual stimuli created by a vehicle crossing over the underpass during an otherwise quiet period (Gagnon et al. 2007 a). Even though moose relocations were obtained every hour during the winter period, this locati on frequency was insufficient to confirm whether or not a moose actually used bridges to cross the highway. A ll that could be determined is that habitat and landscape features on either side of the bridges were classified as high use areas and the probability that a moose used these habitats , and thus the bridges, was also high. Moose crossed the highway more frequently in areas that were not fenced when compared to areas that cont ained any of the three other fence types. Although fences within the Buffalo Fork Valley were not de signed to prevent m oose from crossing the highway, these results concur with those of Seiler (2005) who described the risk of 207 moose-vehicle collisions being greatest along sections of road that did not contain moose- proof fencing. Furthermore, in South Africa, the ratio of total accidents to animal-related acciden ts was significantly less along sections of highway that had a higher proportion of fencing (Eloff and Van Niekerk 2005). In c ontrast, fencing along an interstate highway in Pennsylvania reduced the number of deer obs erved in the right-of-wa y, but it did little to reduce the number of deer-v ehicle collisions (Feldhammer et al. 1986). We suggest that preferred habitat and la ndscape features had much more influence in determining moose crossing locations given that the fence-types present in the Buffalo Fork Valley were not high enough to prevent moose crossings . The predictive ma p indicated that the unfenced section of highway, located within GTNP, contained a high proportion of preferred habitat on either si de of the roadway. Likewi se, from mile marker 7 to approximately 8.5 (i.e., Blackrock Creek), pref erred habitat can be found on both sides of the highway even though the majority of this area primarily contains bighorn fence. Approximately 8.1 km (5.0 mi) of fence, nearly two-thirds of the total length of fencing along the highway, was along privat e land that was not preferre d moose winter habitat. Thus, the likelihood that a m oose would cross a fence in these areas was significantly reduced due to habitat features rather than fence presence. Lack of fence structures in areas of quality moose habitat may have inhi bited our assessment of the influence of fence type on moose movements a ssociated with U.S. Highway 26/287. Approximately 88% of all moose crossing even ts in the Buffalo Fork Valley occurred from afternoon to mid-morning (i.e., 1500 - 0859 hours), which coincided with peaks in daily moose activity patterns (Renecker 1986). Light conditions during these time periods are relatively poor or non-existent which can increas e the risk of moose-vehicle collisions. In Newfoundland, approximately 75% of all moose-vehicle collisions were observed between sunset and sunrise while seve re injuries or death to motorists were twice as likely to occur after dark (Joy ce and Mahoney 2001). Similarly, other studies have demonstrated that highway crossings and the potential of collisions increased significantly from dusk to dawn for ungulat es (Carbaugh et al. 1975, Belant 1995, Groot Hazebroek 1996) and grizzly bears (Waller and Servheen 2005, Graves et al. 2006). In contrast, caribou ( Rangifer tarandus ) were observed to cross roads more frequently during the day (Dyer et al. 2002) , which may minimize collision-risk due to increased motorist visibility. Concurrent with increased highway crossing s during evening and early morning hours is a reduction in traffic volume during these ti me periods. Grizzly bears have been observed to cross more frequently at night when traffic volume was low (Waller and Servheen 2005, Graves et al. 2006). Elk sh ifted use away from highways during the day when traffic volume was high and returned to areas near the highway at night when traffic volumes decreased (Gagnon et al. 2007 b). Furthermore, research along the Trans- Canada Highway in Banff National Park, Canada, has shown reduced permeability of the highway for all wildlife due to very high traffic volume (Alexander and Waters 2000, Alexander et al. 2005). Increa sed traffic volume has also been implicated in preventing bighorn sheep ( Ovis canadensis ) from reaching important mineral sites in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado (Keller and Bender 2007) and with an increased risk of deer-vehicle collisions in Arkansas (F arrell and Tappe 2007). Although traffic volume 208 was not analyzed within the context of moose crossing pr obabilities in our study, when compared to other studies, the relatively lo w number of vehicles on U.S. Highway 26/287 during winter does not appear to im pede moos e movements across the road at the present time. However, the risk of moose-vehicle coll isions is likely incr eased at night due to reduced motorist visibility and a concu rrent increase in moose crossing events. Recommendations Application of the winter ha bitat selection model developed for moose in northwest Wyoming should be used with caution if applied to other sections of highway in the state. The model worked well to identify areas along U.S. Highway 26/287 that have a high risk of moose-vehicle collisions, but the model may not work well if habitats available to moose differ from those found in the Buffalo Fork Valley. If the model is to be used in other areas, it should be tested using an i ndependent sample of crossing locations for validation prior to making assumptions concerning potential mitigation. Snow-track surveys, similar to those conducted by Western Ecosystems Technology, Inc. (Young and Sawyer 2006), would work well in determining the efficacy of the model for other locations. If this is done and model performa nce is not satisfactory, the results of the snow-track survey may be used because areas identified as core moose crossing locations in the Buffalo Fork Valley by Young and Sawyer (2006) were basically the same as those identified in the present study. However, if a more complete understanding of habitat, landscape, and anthropogenic f eatures used by moose to se lect highway crossings is needed, a new study utilizing GPS technology ma y be warranted if the risk of moose- vehicle collisions is high. Although numerous moose crossing events were observed in the Buffalo Fork Valley, only one moose-vehicle collision was record ed during the study. This occurred near milepost 7.4 which was classified as a high probability of use area. The collision occurred on 12 June 2005 and involved an uncolla red, adult female moose that died as a result of the accident. While some accidents may go unreported, moose-vehicle collisions are relatively rare events in th e Buffalo Fork Valley with only 5 collisions reported from 1995 to 2004 (Young and Sawyer 2006). All radio-co llared moose that wintered in the Buffalo Valle y were migratory and most su mmered at higher elevations to the north (Chapter 2). T hus, the greatest risk of collis ions occurred during winter when traffic volume was much lower than during summer. Within the Buffalo Fork Valley, speed limits co uld be reduced and seasonal use of large, temporary warning signs with fl ashing lights could be erected in areas classified as high or medium-high predicted probabilities of use during winter to warn motorists of the increased risk of encountering moose on th e highway (Groot Brui nderink and Hazebroek 1996, Gordon et al. 2004, Sullivan et al. 2004). Speed limits have been identified as an important determinant in the number and sever ity of moose-vehicle co llisions, especially during night when motorist visibility is reduced (Joyce and Mahoney 2001, Seiler 2004, Seiler 2005), but they have also been diffi cult to enforce (Lavsund and Sandegren 1991, Joyce and Mahoney 2001). Since lo cal residents primarily driv e the road during winter, a 209 public awareness program could be implement ed to educate people about the risk of moose-vehicle collisions (Joyce and Mahoney 2001) if traffic volum e increases and the number of moose-vehicle accid ents concurrently rise foll owing highway reconstruction. The message could be conveyed to the public by hosting informational workshops or conducting essay or poster contests at loca l schools (Del Frate and Spraker 1991). Bumper stickers and information packets desc ribing moose and their behavior could also be distributed to lo cal residents and offered to patr ons at gas stations and shops throughout the area. Many touris ts come to northwest Wyoming to observe moose, so the packets could also be used to show areas where they are most likely to see moose. Public service announcements could be broadcast over the radio to inform motorists of areas where the risk of collisions is highe st (Del Frate and Spraker 1991). Major and costly mitigation may not be justified in the Buffalo Fork Valley at the present time unless moose-vehicle collisions increase following highway reconstruction. Vegetation removal along the highway right-of-way to increase motorist visibility may be the most easily-applicable and socially-acceptabl e form of large-scale mitigation (Jaren et al. 1991, Gundersen et al. 1998, Rea 2003, Andreasse n et al. 2005). However, this type of mitigation must be maintained routinely because of moose preference for early seral vegetation (Loranger et al. 1991, Peek 1997). Moose-proof fencing has proven effective, but may only be justified in areas where tr affic volume is high due to the high costs associated with construction and maintena nce (Lavsund and Sandegren 1991, McDonald 1991, Groot Bruinderink and Hazebroek 1996). Caution must be used though because dependent upon where fences terminate, new hi gh-collision-risk areas may be created due to animal movements along fence lines. In extreme cases, electric fencing has proven effective in reducing moose-vehicle collisi ons (Leblond et al. 2007). When used in conjunction with fencing to funnel animals to areas where they are mo st likely to cross a highway (Ng et al. 2004), the use of overpa sses and underpasses that facilitate animal movements has also proven successful (McDonald 1991, Foster and Humphrey 1995, Clevenger and Waltho 2005, Gagnon et al. 2007 a). Crossing structures that greatly improved rates of passage for large anim als are high, wide, and short in length (Clevenger and Waltho 2005) and provide suitable habitat at th e crossing points (Ng et al. 2004). Similar to the expansion of the Bu ffalo Fork Bridge in 2007, lengthening of existing bridges over rivers and streams that act as natural travel corridors may be a cheaper way of facilitating animal movements across the highway rather than erecting costly underpasses and overpasses at importa nt crossing locations (Hubbard et al. 2000, Ng et al. 2004, Sawyer and Rudd 2005, Seiler 2005). Moose are not the only animals that inhab it the Buffalo Fork Valley or cross U.S. Highway 26/287. A suite of large and sma ll carnivores, ungulates, and small rodents have also been documented to cross th e highway (Young and Sawyer 2006). Hence, potential crossing aggregations should be id entified for all wildlife that may cross the highway and mitigation that benefits multiple species should be employed (Sawyer and Rudd 2005). For example, within the Buffalo Fork section of U.S. Highway 26/287, core elk crossing areas were similar to those identified for moose (Young and Sawyer 2006). Thus, mitigation to prevent moose-vehicle coll isions will also assist in preventing elk- vehicle collisions in the Buffalo Fork Valley. Mitigation for multiple species will 210 certainly increase the diff iculty in planning appropriate, and potentially expensive, mitigation, but it will ultimately benefit motorists by increasing highway safety and wildlife by maintaining habitat linkages (Ng et al. 2004). Numerous studies have demonstrated the eff ects of transportation corridors on wildlife, but some animals appear to have a higher tole rance of traffic than others. Alexander et al. (2005) noted that highway permeability was much lower for large carnivores than ungulates along the Trans-Canada Highway in Banff National Park, Canada. They indicated that 300-500 vehicles/d ay decreased highway permeab ility for large carnivores whereas ungulates demonstrated a higher tole rance to increased traffic volume. They also suggested that mitigation should be im plemented at the threshold for carnivores to maintain habitat linkages and reduce habitat fr agmentation for all w ildlife (Alexander et al. 2005). Carnivores may be impacted by current traffic volume along U.S. Highway 26/287 during all seasons while ungulates may be affected during the summer months. Coordination with state a nd federal land and wildlife management agencies should continue after highway reconstruction so th e impacts of the traffic corridor on wildlife can be determined and appropriate mitigation can be implemented to maintain motorist safety and highway permeab ility for wildlife. 211 REFERENCES Alexander, S.
