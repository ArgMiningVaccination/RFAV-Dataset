MERRILL, in his official capacity as Secretary of State of Alabama, and JIM MCCLENDON and CHRIS PRINGLE, in their official capacities as Co-Chairs of the Alabama Permanent Legislative Committee on Reapportionment, Defendants . COMPLAINT THREE-JUDGE PANEL REQUESTED 1. Plaintiffs Evan Milligan, Shalela Dowdy, Lete- tia Jackson, Khadidah Stone, Adia Winfrey, Greater Birmingham Ministries, and the Alabama State Con-ference of the NAACP bring this action to prohibit De- fendants Secretary of State John H. Merrill and the Co-Chairs of the Alabama Permanent Legislative Committee on Reapportionment, Jim McClendon and Chris Pringle, from conducting elections under House JA71 Bill 1 (2021 Second Special Session). H.B. 1, 2d Spec. Sess. (Ala. 2021). 2. House Bill 1 (\"HB 1\") is the latest example of a decades long pattern of the white-controlled Ala- bama Legislature enacting congressional and state legislative districts that discriminate against Black voters to maintain power. Ov er the last fifty years, fed- eral courts or the U.S. Department of Justice have re- peatedly found that the state's redistricting plans violate the rights of Black voters under the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (\"VRA\") and the Fourteenth and Fif- teenth Amendments to the Un ited States Constitution. 3. Plaintiffs allege that HB 1 is the Legislature's latest intentionally discriminatory scheme to pack and crack Black voters into Congressional districts in a manner that prevents the creation of a second major- ity-Black district. Plaintiffs further allege that this scheme is unconstitutional because race was the pre- dominant motive in the drawing of the only majority- Black Congressional District (\"CD\") 7 in a way that is not narrowly tailored to comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (\"VRA\"), 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301. 4. The consideration of race in drawing district lines may be permissible and necessary in many areas of Alabama to ensure compliance with Section 2 of the VRA. But Alabama's consideration of race in the draw- ing of H.B. 1 was not narrowly tailored to comply with the VRA. Rather, HB 1 reflects the Legislature's desire to use of race to maintain power by packing one-third JA72 of Black Alabamians into CD 7 and cracking the re- maining Black community. 5. Moreover, Alabamians were kept in the dark throughout the secretive map drawing process leading up to the introduction of HB 1. Only after the end of the public hearings and, at the eleventh hour, did the Legislature unveil congressional maps where race was the predominant factor in determining the district lines, not for any legitimate purpose, to prevent Black voters from having a fair opportunity to elect candi- dates of choice. The white-majority in the Legislature, including Rep. Pringle and Sen. McClendon, admitted that no racial-polarization analysis was conducted to determine whether the packing of CD 7 was necessary to satisfy the VRA. And the Legislature flatly rejected the requests from the Black community to conduct such an analysis or draw a se cond Black district. In- deed, the Legislature declin ed to share the map with Black legislators or the public before its introduction in the Legislative Committee on Reapportionment. 6. Because the Committee drew, and the Legisla- ture enacted CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7 in HB 1 using race as a predominant factor in a manner that was not narrowly tailored to comply with Section 2 of the VRA or any other compelling governmental interest, these districts violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and must be enjoined. 7. HB 1 denies Black Alabamians an equal op- portunity to participate in the political process by packing one-third of Black Alabamians into CD 7 in JA73 numbers unnecessary to assure them an equal oppor- tunity to elect their preferred candidates. HB 1 also cracks the remaining Black population across CDs 1, 2, and 3 in a way that prevents them from having an opportunity to elect a representative of choice in a sec- ond congressional district. 8. Among other deviations from traditional re- districting principles, the districts in HB 1 splits Mont- gomery County and places voters from the majority-Black counties in the Black Belt 1 into majority-white Congressional districts in low enough numbers that Black voters have no electoral influence. The Legisla-ture enacted this plan even though it could have more naturally drawn a second majority-Black Congres- sional District that complies with traditional redis- tricting principles, like maintaining whole counties, and respects the contiguity and communities of actual interest in the Black Belt counties. 9. The plan does so even though (1) voting-age Black Alabamians (\"BVAP\") 2 are sufficiently numerous 1 The Black Belt includes the core counties of Barbour, Bull- ock, Butler, Choctaw, Crenshaw, Dallas, Greene, Hale, Lowndes, Macon, Marengo, Montgomery, Perry, Pickens, Pike, Russell, Sumter, and Wilcox, as well as Clarke, Conecuh, Escambia, Mon-roe, and Washington counties. The Black Belt is named for the region's fertile black soil. The re gion has a substantial Black pop- ulation because of the many enslaved people brought there to work in the antebellum period. It has been a hotbed of racial dis- crimination and civil rights acti vism from the 1860s to today. 2 \"African American\" or \"Black\" includes Hispanic Black peo- ple and people who are \"Any Part Black,\" i.e., persons who iden-tify as Black or another race on the Census. The \"Black Voting Age Population\" includes all individuals who are 18 years of age JA74 and geographically compact to be a majority of the vot- ing-age population in two single member U.S. Congres- sional districts in Alabama; (2) the voting patterns of Black voters are politically cohesive; and (3) white vot-ers in Alabama vote sufficientl y as a bloc to typically defeat the candidates preferred by Black voters. Voting in Alabama has historically been and remains ex-tremely racially polarized across the state\u2014a fact of which numerous federal courts have taken notice. See, e.g., Ala. Legis. Black Caucus v. Alabama (\"ALBC I \"), 575 U.S. 254, 277 (2015). 10. Moreover, in the areas where a second major- ity-minority congressional district can and should be drawn, the white majority typically votes as a bloc to defeat Black voters' preferred candidates. In the twen-tieth century, Black Alabamians have never elected a congressional representative in any district other than the packed majority-Black CD 7. And CD 7 has only been a majority-Black district since 1992. As a result, Black Alabamians have the opportunity to elect a can- didate of choice in only 14% of the congressional dele-gation (1 of 7) despite making up over 27% of Alabama's voting age population. 11. Alabama's steadfast refusal to provide Black voters with adequate representation in Congress is a or older and who identify as Any Part Black. In Georgia v. Ash- croft, 539 U.S. 461, 473 n.1 (2003), the U.S. Supreme Court de- clared that, where, as here, \"the case involves an examination of only one minority group's effective exercise of the electoral fran-chise . . . it is proper to look at all individuals who identify them-selves as black.\" JA75 product of intentional discrimination and directly linked to the state's history and present conditions of discrimination against Black people. The state's inten- tional policy of disempowerment and discrimination has resulted in the denial of equal opportunity for Black people to participate in the political process in violation of the U.S. Constitution and the VRA. Under the totality of the circumstances, including, inter alia , Alabama's current practices and ongoing history of ra- cial discrimination in voting, the continuing effect of racial discrimination on Black people in areas like ed- ucation, employment, and health, continuing racial ap- peals by political candidates, and the Legislature's lack of responsiveness to the Black community, help to demonstrate that Black voters are being prevented from participating equally in the political process and electing candidates of choice. 12. Accordingly, HB 1 also violates Section 2 of the VRA and must be enjoined in favor of Plaintiffs' demonstrative plan (below in \u00b6 88) or another reme- dial plan that completely cures the illegal vote dilution in HB 1 by establishing two majority-Black congres- sional districts. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 13. This Court has jurisdiction to hear this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343, and 1357 because the matters in controversy arise under the Constitution and laws of the United States, as well as under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988. JA76 14. The Court has jurisdiction to grant declara- tory and injunctive relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202. 15. The Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, who are all citizens of Alabama. 16. A three-judge panel is requested pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2284(a), as this action challenges \"the con- stitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or the apportionment of any statewide legis- lative body.\" 17. Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(b) because a substantia l part of the events giv- ing rise to the claims occu rred in this district and be- cause at least one Defendant resides in this district and all Defendants are Alabama residents. PARTIES 18. Plaintiff Evan Milligan resides in Montgom- ery County, Alabama. He is a U.S. citizen and is a law- fully registered voter who resides in CD 7. As enacted in HB 1, the Legislature dre w CD 7 as a majority-Black district. The Legislature used race as the predominant factor motivating its decisions to place a significant number of voters, like Mr. Milligan, within or outside of the district. CD 7 is no t narrowly tailored to satisfy the VRA or any other compelling interest. HB 1 also packs Black voters like Mr. Milligan into CD 7 to pre- vent the creation of a second majority-Black congres- sional district and, thus, dilute s his vote in violation of JA77 the VRA. Under the demonstrative plan, Mr. Milligan would reside in the remedial second majority-Black district. 19. Plaintiff Shalela Dowdy resides in Mobile County, Alabama. She is a U.S. citizen and is a lawfully registered voter who resides in CD 1. As enacted in HB 1, the Legislature drew CD 1 as a majority-white dis- trict. The Legislature used race as the predominant factor motivating its decisions to place a significant number of voters, like Ms. Dowdy, within or outside of the district. CD 1 is not narrowly tailored to satisfy the VRA or any other compelling interest. HB 1 also frag-ments Black voters like Ms. Dowdy to prevent the cre- ation of a second majority-Black congressional district and, thus, dilutes her vote in violation of the VRA. Un-der the demonstrative plan, Ms. Dowdy would reside in the remedial second majority-Black district. 20. Plaintiff Letetia Jackson resides in the City of Dothan, Alabama. She is a U.S. citizen and is a law- fully registered voter who resides in CD 2. As enacted in HB 1, the Legislature drew CD 2 as a majority-white district. The Legislature used race as the predominant factor motivating its decisions to place a significant number of voters, like Ms. Jackson, within or outside of the district. CD 1 is no t narrowly tailored to satisfy the VRA or any other compelling interest. HB 1 also cracks Black voters like Ms. Jackson to prevent the cre- ation of a second majority-Black congressional district and, thus, dilutes her vote in violation of the VRA. JA78 21. Plaintiff Khadidah Stone resides in Mont- gomery County, Alabama. She is a U.S. citizen and is a lawfully registered voter in CD 2. As enacted in HB 1, the Legislature drew CD 7 as a majority-Black district. The Legislature used race as the predominant factor motivating its decisions to place a significant number of voters, like Mr. Milligan, within or outside of the dis- trict. CD 7 is not narrowly tailored to satisfy the VRA or any other compelling inte rest. HB 1 also packs Black voters like Mr. Milligan into CD 7 to prevent the creation of a second majori ty-Black congressional dis- trict and, thus, dilutes his vote in violation of the VRA. Under the demonstrative plan, Mr. Milligan would re-side in the remedial second majority-Black district. 22. Plaintiff Adia Winfrey resides in Talladega County, Alabama. She is a U.S. citizen and is a lawfully registered voter who resides in CD 3. As enacted in HB 1, the Legislature drew CD 3 as a majority-white dis-trict. The Legislature used race as the predominant factor motivating its decisions to place a significant number of voters, like Ms. Jackson, within or outside of the district. CD 3 is no t narrowly tailored to satisfy the VRA or any other compelling interest. HB 1 also cracks Black voters like Ms. Winfrey to prevent the cre-ation of a second majority-Black congressional district and, thus, dilutes her vote in violation of the VRA. 23. Greater Birmingham Ministries (\"GBM\") was founded in 1969 in response to the challenges posed by the mid-twentieth century Civil Rights move-ment and its transformative impact in Birmingham, Alabama, and across the United States. GBM seeks to JA79 address urgent human rights and social justice needs in the greater Birmingham area. GBM is a multi-faith, multiracial, non-profit membership organization that provides emergency services to people in need and en-gages people to build a strong, supportive, engaged community and a more just society for all people. 24. GBM is dedicated to advancing social justice through political participation across Alabama. GBM actively opposes state laws, policies, and practices that result in the exclusion of vulnerable groups or individ- uals from the democratic process. Toward that end, GBM regularly communicates with its members and works to register, educate, and increase voter turnout and efficacy, particularly among Black, Latinx, and low-income people and people with disabilities. 25. GBM has around 5,000 individual members located primarily throughout the greater Birmingham, Alabama area. GBM also has members in other areas of Alabama including Mobile, Tuscaloosa, Montgomery, and Madison Counties. Many GBM members are Black registered voters. GBM has members who are regis- tered voters who live and vote in CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7. These members have been and, if HB 1 is not enjoined, will continue to be harmed by HB 1's assignment of them to unconstitutionally racially gerrymandered districts. Members of GBM include Black voters whose votes are unlawfully diluted by the packing of Black voters into CD 2 and the cracking of Black voters re- siding in CDs 1, 2, and 3 in violation of the VRA. Mem-bers of GBM include Black vo ters who would reside in a remedial second majority-Black district. JA80 26. The Alabama State Conference of the N.A.A.C.P. (\"Alabama NAACP\") is the state conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Inc. The Alabama NAACP is the oldest and one of the most significant civil rights organiza- tions in Alabama, and it works to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of Black Americans and all other Americans. Two central goals of the Alabama NAACP are to eliminate racial discrim- ination in the democratic process, and to enforce fed-eral laws and constitutional provisions securing voting rights. Toward those ends, the Alabama NAACP has participated in lawsuits to protect the right to vote, regularly engages in efforts to register and educate voters and encourages Black people to engage in the political process by turning out to vote on Election Day. 27. The Alabama NAACP has thousands of members in Jefferson County, the Black Belt and other counties across the state. Mo st of the members of the Alabama NAACP are Black registered voters. The Al- abama NAACP's members include registered voters who reside and vote in CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7. These mem- bers have been and, if HB 1 is not enjoined, will con- tinue to be harmed by HB l' s assignment of them to unconstitutionally racially gerrymandered districts. The Alabama NAACP's members include Black regis- tered voters whose votes are unlawfully diluted by the packing of Black voters into CD 2 and the cracking of Black voters in CDs 1, 2, and 3 in violation of the VRA. Members of the Alabama NAACP include Black JA81 registered voters who would reside in a remedial sec- ond majority-Black district. 28. Defendant John H. Merrill is sued in his offi- cial capacity as Alabama Secre tary of State. As Secre- tary of State, Defendant Merrill is the chief elections official in the State of Alabama. He must provide uni-form guidance for election activities in the State and certify the elections of members to the Alabama Legis- lature and Congress. Ala. Co de \u00a7\u00a7 17-1-3, 17-12-21.

In that capacity, Defendants McClendon and Pringle prepared and developed redistricting plans for the State following the decennial census and presided over the meetings of the Committee. The Committee was tasked with making a \"conti nuous study of the reap- portionment problems in Alabama seeking solutions thereto\" and reporting its investigations, findings, and recommendations to the Legislature as necessary for the \"preparation and formulation\" of redistricting plans for the Senate, House, and congressional dis-tricts in the State of Alabama. Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a7 29-2-51, 29- 2-52. Defendants McClendon and Pringle led the JA82 drawing of CDs 1, 2, 3 and 7. Defendants McClendon and Pringle will lead the Legislature's efforts to re- draw and remedy the congressional districts' illegality if ordered to do so by this Court. STATEMENT OF FACTS The History of Majority-Black Congressional District 7 30. The establishment of CD 7 as a majority- Black district in the 1990s redistricting cycle was the first time in the twentiet h century that Black Alabam- ians had the opportunity to elect a candidate of choice to Congress. 31. In 1992, Black voters challenged the failure of the Legislature to redistrict after the release of the 1990 census and the lack of a majority-Black congres- sional district under Section 2 of the VRA. Upon the stipulation of the parties, a court ordered the creation of CD 7 as a majority-Black congressional district to comply with the VRA. See Wesch v. Hunt , 785 F. Supp. 1491, 1498 (S.D. Ala.), aff 'd sub nom. Camp v. Wesch , 504 U.S. 902 (1992). 32. Because the Legislature failed to enact and preclear its own map, the court's plan remained in ef- fect for the rest of the 1990s. After the 2000 and 2010 redistricting cycles, the Legislature continued to enact this version of CD 7 with changes only to address pop- ulation shifts. JA83 33. Even today, the core of CD 7 remains the same as it was drawn by the Wesch court. 34. In recent litigation, however, Alabama ad- mitted that CD 7 \"appears to be racially gerryman- dered, with a finger sticking up from the black belt for the sole purpose of grabbing the black population of Jefferson County. Defendant does not believe that the law would permit Alabama to draw that district today if the finger into Jefferson County was for the predom-inate purpose of drawing African American voters into the district.\" Secretary of St ate Merrill's Pretrial Brief, Chestnut v. Merrill, No. 2: 18-CV-00907 (N.D. Ala. Oct. 28, 2019), ECF No. 101 at 11. 35. Despite this admission, neither the State Legislature, nor Defendants took steps to remedy this racial gerrymander in the wake of the 2020 census. This racial gerrymandering was not narrowly tailored to comply with the VRA. Rather the Legislature simply continued to improperly use race to place Black voters into the existing supermajority Black CD 7, even though the Legislature knew it was possible to draw CD 7 as an effective majority-Black district without needlessly splitting political subdivisions, counties, and communities of actual shared interests. JA84 The Process Leading to the Enactment of H.B. 1 Joint Legislative Committee's Stated Redistricting Criteria 36. On May 5, 2021, the Permanent Legislative Committee on Reapportionment (the \"Committee\")\u2014 the Committee responsible for preparing and devel- oping redistricting plans fo r the State following each decennial census\u2014enacted guidelines for the 2021 redistricting cycle. The guidelines state that they are based on the requirements of the U.S. Constitution, Alabama Constitution, and policies that \"are embed- ded in the political values, traditions, customs, and usages of the State of Alabama.\" 37. The criteria for redistricting set by the Com- mittee begin with requirements under the U.S. Consti- tution and federal law, including compliance with the one-person, one-vote requirement. The Committee in-structed that Congressional districting maps \"shall have minimal population deviation\" and comply with Section 2 of the VRA, meaning that districts have \"nei-ther the purpose nor the effect of diluting minority vot- ing strength.\" The Committee further stated that districts cannot be drawn \"in a manner that subordi-nates race-neutral districting criteria to considera- tions of race, color, or membership in a language minority group, except that race, color, or membership in a language-minority group may predominate over race-neutral districting criteria to comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, provided there is a strong JA85 basis in evidence in support of such a race-based choice.\" 38. Each district must also be \"contiguous and reasonably compact,\" under the criteria. 39. The criteria next require compliance with the Alabama Constitution, including that: a. Districts are \"drawn to reflect the demo- cratic will of all the people concerning how their governments should be restructured\"; b. Districts are drawn based on total population except that voting-age population may be considered to comply with Section 2 of the VRA and other laws; c. The number of Senate districts is set at 35 and House districts at 105; d. All districts must be single-member districts; and e. All districts must be contiguous with each other. 40. The criteria further require compliance with redistricting policies that are \"embedded in the politi- cal values, traditions, custom s, and usages of the State of Alabama . . . to the extent that they do not violate or subordinate the foregoing policies prescribed by the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Alabama,\" including: a. Avoiding contests between incumbents where possible; JA86 b. Permitting contiguity by water but not point- to-point or long-lasso contiguity; c. Respect for \"communities of interest, neigh- borhoods, and political subdivisions to the ex- tent practicable,\" with a community of interest \"defined as an area with recognized similarities of interests, including but not lim- ited to ethnic, racial, economic, tribal, social, geographic, or historical identities.\" d. Minimization of the number of counties in each district; and e. Preservation of the cores of existing districts. 41. The Committee did not prioritize the criteria, except that \"equality of population among districts and compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965\" take priority when they conflict with other criteria. The 2021 Legislative Process for Redistricting 42. On August 12, 2021, the U.S. Census Bureau released the results of the 2020 Census. Alabama's population grew by 5.1% between 2010 and 2020. Ala- bama's current population identifies as 63.1% non-His-panic white, 26.9% as any pa rt Black, 5.3% as Hispanic or Latino, 2.3% as any part American Indian/Alaska Native, and 2% as any part Asian. Communities of color drove population growth in the 2020 census. The Black population grew by 3.5%, the Hispanic/Latino population by 42.3%, the Asian-American population increased by 43.4%, and the white population shrunk by 1%. The population identifying as solely Native JA87 American shrank as well, wh ile the proportion of Ala- bamians identifying as multi-racial tripled. 43. Once census data was released, the Commit- tee, under the leadership of Sen. McClendon and Rep. Pringle began to develop redistricting plans for con- gressional districts. See Ala. Code \u00a7 29-2-50(2). 44. The Committee consists of members of both the State House and Senate, with the Speaker of the House appointing one House member from each of the seven congressional districts and four additional House members and the Lieu tenant Governor appoint- ing one Senator from each of the seven congressional districts and four additional Senators. See Ala. Code \u00a7 29-2-51(c). The 2021 Reapportionment Committee includes 21 members-15 white Republicans and six Black Democrats. 3 45. All Committee meetings must be open to the public and the Committee must provide a \"[r]easona- ble opportunity\" for members of the public to give com-ments and input regarding redistricting. 3 Ala.

Between September 1 and 16, well before the Committee released any draft maps or proposals, the Legislative Reapportionment Office held 28 public hearings across the state. All but one hearing\u2014held at 6:00 pm at the Statehouse in Montgomery\u2014was held between the normal workday hours of 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, i.e., times when the ge neral public was least able to attend. 47. Although Committee Co-Chair Sen. Jim McClendon claimed the public hearings served \"to try to give the opportunity for any citizen to have input into the process,\" before the public hearings even began, he told the press that the new maps would not cause \"any surprises for the candidates or for the voters.\" Mike Cason, Alabama lawmakers begin task of drawing new political districts , Ala. Media Group, Aug. 31, 2021, https://www.a l.com/news/2021/08/alabama- lawmakers-begin-task-of-drawing-new-political-districts. html. 48. On October 19, 2021, Plaintiffs the Alabama NAACP and Greater Birming ham Ministries, and others sent a le tter to the Alabama Permanent Com- mittee on Reapportionment reminding them of their obligations under Section 2 of the VRA, highlighting the Committee's obligation to conduct a racial-polari- zation analysis to ensure that the redistricting com-plied with the VRA and that th e race was used only in a narrowly tailored manner to comply with a compel- ling state interest. Letter from LDF et al. to Ala. Leg- islative Reapportionment Office, Oct. 19, 2021, JA89 https://www.naacpldforg/wp-con tent/uploads/Letter-to- 49. Governor Kay Ivey called the Special Legis- lative Session on redistricting in Alabama to begin on October 28, 2021. 50. On October 26, 2021, the Committee held its first public meeting of this redistricting cycle. The pro- posed maps were not available to the public until the day before\u2014October 25. A member of the Committee, Rep. Chris England, a Black legislator, published the proposed maps on Twitter. @RepEngland70, Twitter (Oct. 25, 2021, 12:30 p.m.), https://twitter.com/Rep England70/status/1452674045804167169. The Commit- tee itself did not release th e maps to the public until the day of the Committee meeting, and many Commit- tee members did not see the full proposed maps beyond their own districts and those surrounding their own district until the day before their meeting. Beyond the Committee, the Committee Co-Chairs and their staff met with each incumbent legislator or their staff either in person or online; individual legislators only viewed and provided feedback on draft maps of their districts, not maps of the entire state. 51. The Co-Chairs asserted that the Committee's lawyer, Dorman Walker, reviewed the maps and deter-mined that they all complied with Section 2 of the VRA and the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitu- tion but did not explain w hat analysis had been under- taken. Mr. Walker has been the Committee's lawyer for 25 years, including when a federal court held that 12 JA90 districts were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. Sen. McClendon explained that Mr. Walker told him that racial-polarization analysis was only done for state legislative districts\u2014by an unnamed consultant in Georgia\u2014where \"it looked like there might possibly be a racial issue\" rather than analyzing every district. 52. No racial-polarization analysis was con- ducted for CD 7\u2014the single majority-minority Con- gressional district in the state. Rep. Pringle told the Committee that Mr. Walker said that a racial-polariza- tion analysis was unnecessary because the district has a BVAP of around 54%, but di d not explain the signifi- cance of that number, and when Rep. England asked Sen. McClendon to explain the relationship between a BVAP of 54% and the actual or potential results of a racial-polarization study, Sen. McClendon replied, \"I got no clue.\" 53. No racial-polarization analysis for any dis- tricts was provided to Committee members before or during the meeting. Committee members only received demographic and population data for each district and neither Mr. Walker nor the unnamed Georgia consult- ant attended the Committee meeting. 54. Rep. Laura Hall, a Black legislator, moved to postpone any vote on the proposed maps until the Committee members and the public had time to review the maps and accompanying racial-polarization analy- sis. That motion failed a long racial lines\u2014with all the Black committee members voting for it. JA91 55. Each of the maps passed along racial lines out of Committee\u2014with all the Black members of the Committee voting against the maps. 56. The Special Legislative Session for redis- tricting began a mere two days later, on October 28, 2021. Throughout the special session of the Legisla-ture, the co-chairs of the Reapportionment Committee represented that the congressional districts were drafted by incumbent members of Alabama's Congres-sional delegation to maintain their current districts with only those changes necessary to equalize popula- tions. 57. On October 29, 2021, the Alabama House State Government Committee met to discuss the Re-apportionment Committee's proposed districting plan for Alabama's U.S. House delegation. When asked what the process was for incorporating public comment into the proposed districting plans and whether a racial-po- larization analysis had been conducted, Representa- tive Chris Pringle said \"no\" and that \"we're working on it.\" 58. Multiple times throughout the Committee meeting, Rep. Pringle noted that he had not seen full plans from outside groups, including the Alabama NAACP and Greater Birmingham Ministries. Yet, without specifying when an analysis would be com- plete or on what maps, Rep. Pringle also stated that he was \"running analysis\" on maps from outside groups. 59. Rep. John Rogers, a Black legislator, asked Rep. Pringle whether the Reapportionment Committee JA92 considered questions from organizations such as the Alabama NAACP and Greater Birmingham Minis- tries, particularly as to Dis trict 7. Rep. Pringle replied that \"we're looking at everything.\" But Rep. Pringle couched his statement by noting \"it's this horrific time crunch that we're under,\" and that he wished he \"had more time to do this.\" 60. Rep. Pringle again clai med that plans from outside groups were still being analyzed. He further admitted not knowing why there had not been a racial- polarization analysis of CD 7. 61. Rep. Pringle stated that he would \"go back and look at the numbers\" but proceeded to call a vote on the map anyway. The Committee gave the congres-sional map a favorable report. 62. Later in the Committee, Plaintiff Evan Milli- gan asked Rep. Pringle whether the Reapportionment Committee conducted racial polarization studies on any of the maps. Rep. Pring le replied that such studies were conducted on \"some of the districts that we were concerned about,\" but that th ey \"were still working on it.\" Again, Rep. Pringle offered no detail or timeline. And Rep. Pringle did not answer whether the Commit- tee lacked the necessary data to determine whether the map violated federal law. 63. On. November 1, the full House considered the congressional map. Rep. England asked again why no racial-polarization study had been done for CD 7, and asked about the status of the racial-polarization JA93 study for CD 7 that he had requested in the Reappor- tionment Committee. 64. Rep. Pringle replied that a racial-polariza- tion study was done only for districts \"if we thought it was necessary.\" In his view, only districts with a BVAP of 51% or less required a racial-polarization study. He did not state the legal or factual basis for this 51% or less rule. 65. Rep. Pringle again admitted to Rep. England that \"they didn't do\" the racial-polarization study for CD 7, \"not yet.\" But Rep. Pringle assured him that \"somebody\" would do the anal ysis for that district. 66. Rep. England asked whether it was \"by coin- cidence\" that CD 7 happened to have a BVAP of around 55% when race was allegedly not taken into account during the initial drawing. 67. Rep. Pringle responded that they \"at- tempt[ed] to maintain the co re of the existing dis- tricts.\" He noted that CD 7 originally was drawn in the early 1990s, \"and we've maintained the core of that dis- trict ever since\" despite significant population and de-mographic changes. Rep. Prin gle specified that CD 7 was underpopulated by around 53,000 people. CD 7 had the most population to gain out of all the congres-sional districts. 68. Rep. England reiterated his concerns about keeping CD 7 largely the same throughout the dec- ades: \"The 7th congressional district manages to main- tain somehow almost the exact shape that it has had JA94 the last 20 years, but specifi cally the same sort of black voting age population\" as the early 1990s, even when it needed to gain 53,000 people. 69. The House passed the congressional map by a vote of 65-38. 70. On November 2, 2021, the Senate General Fund and Appropriations Committee considered the State House and congressional maps. 71. The Committee gave both maps a favorable report in under twenty minutes. Sen. Allen remarked that the Reapportionment Committee consulted mem- bers of Congress and attorneys about the congressional map but did not speak to any State Senator. Another Senator suggested that the Senate \"lean[s] too heavily\" towards the subjective advice of attorneys \"without re- ally getting involved and understanding the rationale as to why\" the maps were drawn as-is. 72. Regardless, the Committee gave the congres- sional map a favorable report. 73. The next day, November 3, the full Senate considered the congressional map. 74. Sen. Bobby Singleton, a Black legislator, asked Sen. McClendon whether anyone had considered maps that were proposed at public hearings months before\u2014well before the 10-day rule for maps proposed by outside groups. 75. Sen. McClendon indicated that he had seen the map proposed by the League of Women Voters but JA95 rejected it because of \"serious flaws.\" Specifically, he found the map flawed because it put two members of Congress within the same district. Sen. McClendon al- leged that pitting the incumbents around each other would violate Section 2 of the Reapportionment Com- mittee Guidelines, \"which says contests between in- cumbents will be avoided whenever possible.\" 76. Sen. McClendon also offered that the League of Women Voters map would violate Section 2 of the VRA by eliminating the sole majority-minority district in the state. 77. Sen. Singleton challen ged Sen. McClendon on whether CD 7 is a racially gerrymandered district. Sen. McClendon replied \"Gerrymandering is in the eye of the beholder.\" 78. Sen. Rodger Smitherman, a Black legislator, offered a substitute whole-co unties map, which he as- serted was aimed at eliminating racial gerrymander- ing. This map included tw o districts with BVAP over 40%, but no majority-BVAP districts. Sen. Smither- man claimed that a raci al-polarizati on analysis showed that these district s were Black \"opportunity\"- districts. 4 79. Sen. McClendon objected to the Smitherman plan because Sen. McClendon maintained that it vio- lated the VRA and because it placed two incumbent 4 In \"opportunity\" or \"crossover\" districts, the Black voters form a sizable enough minority to enable them, with help from some of the white majority in the district, to elect a candidate of choice. Cooper v. Harris , 137 S. Ct. same majority-Black CD 7. The Senate voted 23-7 along racial lines to reject the Smitherman plan\u2014with all Black Senators voting in favor of the Smitherman plan. 80. Sen. Singleton also o ffered two substitute maps that, according to him, included two Black-oppor- tunity congressional districts. These maps had only 2.6% and 0.7% deviation for District 7. He explained that, so long as a district provides voters with the op-portunity to elect candidates of their choice, it was un- necessary for a district to have over 50% BVAP to comply with Section 2 of the VRA. 81. The Senate tabled consideration of both maps. 82. Sen. Kirk Hatcher, a Black legislator, offered the demonstrative map prepared by Plaintiffs Greater Birmingham Ministries and the Alabama NAACP as a substitute map. He stated t hat this map sought to en- sure \"that all Black Alabamians have an opportunity to elect their preferred congressional representatives.\" Sen. Hatcher's substitute map failed an up-or-down vote\u2014with all Black legislators voting in favor of it. 83. Again, Sen. McClendon repeated that the congressional maps in HB 1 were drawn \"race blind\" even though the mapping software could display race. Sen. McClendon contended that the Supreme Court re- quired \"race blind\" drawing of the congressional map after the 2010 Census. \"The co urts told us what we had to do, keeping in mind the whole time, this is a racial issue. This is not about splitting counties. And this is JA97 not about splitting precincts. This is about drawing maps based on race. That's not good.\" He further al- leged that, at this point in the redistricting process, it would be impermissible to consider race when altering the map. 84. The Senate tabled several other substitute maps. 85. The Senate then passed the congressional map by a vote of 22-7\u2014along racial lines with all Black senators voting against the map. Plaintiffs Satisfy the Three Gingles Preconditions for Proving a Vote Dilution Claim under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act Gingles I : The Committee could have Drawn a Second Majority-Black Cong ressional District with a Reasonably Compact Blac k Population that is Linked as a Community by Common Interests 86. The Alabama's Black population is suffi- ciently large, geographically compact enough to consti- tute majorities of the voting age population in two congressional districts. 87. Per the demonstrative map in \u00b6 89 below, CD 7 can be redrawn to include most of the City of Bir-mingham and the surrounding Black communities in Jefferson and southern Tuscaloosa Counties, all the majority-Black counties of Hale, Greene, Sumter, Perry, Dallas, most of majority-Black Marengo County, and portions of Choctaw, Autauga, Bibb, and Pickens JA98 Counties with large Black populations. Demonstrative CD 7 would have a BVAP of 52.6%, which is sufficient for Black voters to elect a representative of choice de- spite the persistence of raci ally polarized voting in Alabama. This CD 7 is narrowly tailored to comply with the VRA. 88. Demonstrative CD 2 can be redrawn as a sec- ond majority-Black district to include all of majority- Black Montgomery County, rather than splitting it be-tween districts, all of the surrounding majority-Black counties of Lowndes, Wilcox, and Bullock, and part of majority-Black Macon and Marengo Counties, all of the over-40% Black counties of Pike, Butler, Barbour, Conecuh, and Clarke, as w ell as the majority-Black City of Mobile. Demonstrative CD 2 would have a BVAP of 50.1%, which is sufficient for Black voters to elect a representative of ch oice despite persistent ra- cially polarized voting. This CD 2 is narrowly tailored to comply with the VRA. 89. The map below shows demonstrative CDs 2 and 7 as reasonably compact areas of Black voters with majorities in two Alabama co ngressional districts. The majority-Black CD 7 is colored teal, and the majority-Black CD 2 is colored orange. The map has zero popu- lation deviation, keeps most counties whole, and satis- fies other redistricting criteria. Black voters in these districts are members of communities of interests with a shared history, political beliefs, cultural values, and economic interests. Their hi story includes a history of discrimination, and their shared beliefs include a JA99 desire for livable wages, quality healthcare, and a sec- ond majority-Black district. JA100 90. There are other ways to draw two majority- Black districts, however. For example, an alternative demonstrative CD 2 could be drawn as a second major- ity-Black district while adhering to all the state's re-districting criteria, like maintaining zero population deviation and whole counties. This CD 2 could include all of Montgomery County and the Black Belt counties in the western part of the state, while ceding Ala- bama's southernmost counties to CD 1. Gingles II : Voting Remains Racially Polarized in Alabama Across the State 91. Voting is racially polarized across the state. \"The surest indication of race-conscious politics is a pattern of racially polarized voting.\" 1567 (11th Cir. 1984). 92. Numerous federal courts in Alabama have found that the state's elections are racially polarized. See, e.g., Ala. State Conf. of NAACP v. Alabama , No. 2:16-CV-731-WKW, 2020 WL 583803, at *17 (M.D. Ala. Feb. 5, 2020) (accepting the undisputed statistical evi-dence proving the existence of racially polarized voting statewide); Jones v. Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Educ. , No. 2:19-cv-01821-MHH, 2019 WL 7500528, at *2 (N.D. Ala. Dec. 16, 2019) (concludin g that \"voting is racially polarized in the multimember district [of the Jeffer- son County school board] insofar as Black voters are politically cohesive and White people vote sufficiently as a bloc to enable them to defeat Black voters' JA101 preferred candidates.\"); United States v. 2d 1339, 1345-46 & n.3 (M.D. Ala. 2011) (find- ing that voting is racially polarized across Alabama); see also ALBC I , 575 U.S. at 277 (noting the existence of racially polarized voting in Alabama elections). \"In an environment characterized by racially polarized voting, politicians can predictably manipulate elec-tions\u2014either by drawing dist ricts or setting an issue for a referendum\u2014to minimize or cancel out minority voters' ability to elect their preferred candidates.\" McGregor , 824 F. Supp. 2d at 1346 (internal citation, quotation marks, and alterations omitted). 93. There is a causal relationship between racial bloc voting and the state's history of racial discrimina- tion. \"Racial bloc voting by whites is attributable in part to past discrimination, and the past history of seg- regation and discrimination affects the choices of vot- ers at the polls.\" Brown v. Bd. of School Comm'rs of Mobile City , 542 F. Ala. 1982), aff 'd 702 F.2d 1103 (11th Cir. 1983), aff 'd 464 U.S. 1005 (1983). 94. In 2013 and 2014, Burton LeFlore, a Black Democrat, sought election to the U.S. House from CD 1, but both times\u2014as the c andidate of choice for Black voters\u2014LeFlore was defeated by Bradley Byrne, a white Republican, in wide margins that reflect the sig-nificant racially polarized voting in Alabama. 95. In the 2008 U.S. Senate race, 90% of Black voters supported State Senator Vivian Figures, the Democratic candidate, while 89 % of white voters voted JA102 for Republican U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions. In that race, Senator Sessions won the support of a majority of white voters regardless of party affiliation: 58% of white Democrats, 88% of white Independents, and 96% of white Republicans. By contrast, Sen. Figures won the support of 84% of non -white voters of any party. 96. In 2018, Black candidates for Lieutenant Governor, State Auditor, and the Public Service Com- mission lost statewide general elections to white can-didates wherein the Black candidates received upwards of 95% of Black voter support, and white can- didates received upwards of 85% of white voter sup-port. 97. Voting in primary elections in Alabama is also racially polarized. That is, even when voters are choosing among candidates fr om the same party race still influences their vote. For example, in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary, Black people over- whelmingly voted for Barack Obama, whereas most white voters supported Hilla ry Clinton or other white candidates. Gingles III : White Block Voting Typically Defeats Black Candidates of Choice 98. In the areas where a second majority-minor- ity congressional district can and should be drawn, the white majority votes as a bloc typically resulting in the defeat of Black voters' cand idates of choice. In the twentieth century, Black Alabamians have never elected a congressional representative of choice JA103 outside of the majority-Black CD 7, and only since 1992. Thus, the lack of a seco nd Black dist rict restricts Black Alabamians influence to only approximately 14% of the congressional delegation, despite account-ing for 27% of the state's population. 99. In congressional races in the current major- ity-white CDs 1, 2, and 3, Black candidates and Black favored candidates have never won election to Con- gress. 100. For example, in 2020 in District 1, white and white-preferred candidate Rep. Bradley Byrne de-feated Black and Black-preferred candidate James Averhart by approximately 29 percentage points in a district that was approximately 25.7% BVAP. The same was true in 2018, with Rep. Byrne defeating Black and Black-preferred candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. by over 26 percentage points. 101. In 2020 in District 2, which is 30.6% BVAP, white and white-preferred c andidate Rep. Barry Moore defeated Black and Black-preferred candidate Phyllis Harvey-Hall by over 30 perce ntage points. In 2018 in District two, white and white-preferred candidate Rep. Martha Roby defeated Black-preferred candidate Tabi- tha Isner by 23 percentage points. 102. In 2020 in District 3, which 25.8% BVAP, white and white-preferred candidate Rep. Mike Rogers defeated Black and Black- preferred candidate Adia Winfrey by 35 percentage points. Similarly, in 2018, Rep. Rogers defeated Black-preferred candidate Mal- lory Hagan by over 27 percentage points. JA104 The Totality of the Circumstances, Including Senate Factors Demonstrate that HB 1 Violates Prevents Black Voters in Alabama from Participating in the Political Process on Equal T erms and Electing Representatives of Choice 103. The three Gingles requirements are neces- sary preconditions but, to establish liability, Plaintiffs must also demonstrate that \"the totality of the circum- stances results in an unequal opportunity for minority voters to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choosing as compared to other members of the electorate.\" Ga. State Conf of NAACP F.3d 1336, 1342 (11th Cir. 2015). 104. Although district courts must perform this totality-of-the-circumstances analysis, \"it will be only the very unusual case in which the plaintiffs can es- tablish the existence of the three Gingles factors but still have failed to establish a violation of \u00a7 2 under the totality of circumstances.\" Id. (citation omitted). 105. To undertake the totality-of-the-circum- stances determination, courts use the nine factors drawn from a report of the Senate Judiciary Commit-tee accompanying the 1982 amendments to the VRA, i.e., the \"Senate Factors.\" Id. But courts are not limited to solely considering these factors, nor is there a re-quirement that \"any particular number of factors be proved, or that a majority of them point one way or the JA105 other.\" Id. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Senate Factor 1: Alabama has an Extensive and Ongoing History of Voting Discrimination 106. In five of the six decennial redistricting cy- cles between 1960 to 2010, cou rts or the U.S. Depart- ment of Justice found that Alabama's congressional map or state legislative maps discriminated against Black voters in violation of the Constitution or the VRA. 107. Prior to 1960, the Legislature failed to reap- portion for 50 years\u2014diluting the votes of residents in rapidly expanding counties. As a result, Alabama's en- tire legislative apportionment scheme was struck down for violating the principle of one person, one vote. Reynolds v. Sims , 377 U.S. 533, 568 (1964). On remand, a three judge court found that, in devising remedial maps to correct the malapportionment, the \"Legisla-ture intentionally aggregated predominantly Negro counties with predominantly white counties for the sole purpose of preventing the election of Negroes to [State] House membership.\" Sims v. Baggett , 247 F. Supp. 96, 108-109 (M.D. Ala. 1965). 108. Following Reynolds and the 1970 Census, the Legislature again failed to redistrict and a three judge federal court was forced to draw new district lines. Sims v. Amos , 336 F. Supp. 924, 940 (M.D. Ala. 1972). The court rejected the Alabama Secretary of State's proposed map be cause of its racially JA106 \"discriminatory effect\" on Black voters. Id. at 936. In the 1980s, the United States Attorney General denied preclearance under the VRA to maps drawn by the Legislature to redistrict St ate House and Senate maps because of their discriminatory effect on Black voters in Jefferson County and the Black Belt. U.S. Dep't of Justice Ltr. to Ala. Attorney General Graddick, May 6, 1982, https://www.justice.g ov/sites/default/files/crt/ legacy/2014/05/30/AL-1520.pdf. Shortly thereafter, a three judge court rejected Alabama's proposed interim remedial state maps in pa rt because Alabama's maps \"had the effect of reducing the number of 'safe' black districts\" in and near Jefferson County. Burton v. Hob- bie, 543 F. Supp. 235, 238 (M.D. Ala. 1982). 109. After the 1990 census, the State entered a consent decree to resolve a VRA lawsuit filed on behalf of Black voters. See Brooks v. Hobbie , 631 So.2d 883, 884 (Ala. 1993). 110. Most recently, after the 2010 census, Black voters and legislators successfully challenged state legislative districts as unconstitutional racial gerry- manders. See Ala. Legis. Black Caucus v. Alabama (\"ALBC II \"), 231 F. Supp. 3d 1026, 1348-49 (M.D. Ala. 2017). 111. Alabama's history of discrimination dates to the state's admission to the union. Before the Civil War, Black people were barred from voting in the state. After the passage of the Reconstruction Acts and Amendments, Alabama was forced to allow Black men access to the franchise, and the 1867 Alabama JA107 Constitution granted every male person over the age of 21\u2014who satisfied the citizenship and residency re- quirements\u2014the right to vote. This meant that for the first time in Alabama's hist ory, Black people voted and held public office. 112. In response, white leaders reformed the Democratic party with the in tent of \"redeeming\" the State and re-establishing white supremacy. This was accomplished by using violence to deter Black people from political participation and, once the Redeemers returned to political office, to pass racially discrimina- tory laws to cement their control. 113. Between 1868 and 1872, the Ku Klux Klan maintained an active membership in Alabama's rural areas and suppressed the Black vote by beating and killing Republican leaders, burning their homes, lynch- ing Black Americans, and sending bands of armed white men on horseback to break up Republican polit- ical rallies and intimidate voters. 114. In 1874, Democratic candidates were elected to public office in la rge numbers, mainly due to the party's use of violence ag ainst and intimidation of Black voters. On election da y, in Eufaula, Alabama, members of a white paramilitary group known as the White League, killed several unarmed Black Republi-can voters and turned away thousands of voters from the polls. 115. The following year, in 1875, the Alabama legislature adopted a new state constitution and passed a series of local la ws and ordinances designed JA108 to strip Black Americans of the civil rights they en- joyed briefly during Reconstruction. 116. Violent intimidation of Black voters contin- ued throughout the 1880s and 1890s, and by the twen- tieth century white leaders in Alabama had declared Black disenfranchisement a policy goal. At the 1901 Constitutional Convention, 155 white male delegates gathered in Montgomery with the express intention \"to establish white supremacy in the State.\" 117. The Convention ratified changes to the con- stitution that required literacy tests as a prerequisite to register to vote and mandated payment of an annual $1.50 poll tax, which was intended to and had the ef- fect of disenfranchi sing Black voters. United States v. Alabama , 252 F. Supp. 95, 99 (M.D. Ala. 1966). 118. After the passage of the 1901 Constitution, the number of Black registered voters in Alabama dropped from 180,000 to 3,000. 119. Alabama's discriminatory voter registration system, combined with cont inued violent intimidation, successfully suppressed Black voting in the state for several more generations, with no significant federal intervention until the passage of the VRA in 1965. 120. In 1964 and 1965, Alabama's discrimination and brutality against Black voters was on full display in Selma, where Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark, Ala-bama state troopers, and vigilantes violently assaulted peaceful Black protesters attempting to gain access to the franchise. JA109 121. On March 7, 1965, in what became known as Bloody Sunday, state troopers viciously attacked and brutally beat unarmed peaceful civil rights activ- ists crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, where less than 5 percent of Black voters were regis- tered to vote. Bloody Sunday helped pave the way for the passage of the VRA in 1965 and Alabama was de-clared a \"covered\" state under Section 4(b) of the Act. 122. Between 1965 and 2013, at least 100 vot- ing changes proposed by Al abama state, county or city officials were either b locked or altered pursuant to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. U.S. Dep't of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Voting Section, Voting Determination Letters for Alabama , https://www.justice. govicrt/voting-determination-letters-alabama (last up-dated May 18, 2020). This includes at least 16 objec- tions between 1969 and 2008 in cases where a proposed state or local redistricting plan had the pur-pose or would have the effect of diminishing the ability of Black voters to elect th eir candidates of choice. Id.; see 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10304(b). 123. Beyond redistricting, Alabama has em- ployed voting practices that impair Black electoral suc-cess. In 1986, for instance, a court found that the state laws requiring numbered posts for nearly every at- large voting system in Alabama had been intentionally enacted to dilute Black voti ng strength, and that num- bered posts had the effect of diluting Black voting strength in at-large elections. Dillard v. Crenshaw Cty. , 640 F. Supp. 1347, 1357 (1986). The court also found that from the late 1800s to the 1980s, Alabama had JA110 purposefully manipulated the method of electing local governments as needed to prevent Black citizens from electing their preferred candidates. Id. 124. Ultimately, a defendant class of 17 county commissions, 28 county school boards, and 144 munic- ipalities were found to be employing at-large election systems designed and motivated by racial discrimina- tion. These cases resulted in settlement agreements with about 180 Alabama jurisdictions that were re-quired to adopt new election systems including single- member districts, limited voting, and cumulative vot- ing systems, in an attempt to purge the state's election systems of intentional discrimination. See James Blacksher, et. al., Voting Rights in Alabama: 1982- 2006 , 17 S. Cal. Rev. L. & Soc. Just. 249, 264 (2008). 125. Federal courts have continued to rule against municipal at-large voting systems created by the State Legislature. See, e.g., Jones , 2019 WL 7500528, at *4 (finding that the at-large multimember district used to elect board members violated Section 2 of the VRA); Ala. State Conf of the NAACP v. City of Pleasant Grove , No. 2:18-cv-02056, 2019 WL 5172371, at *1 (N.D. Ala. Oct. 11, 2019) (ordering changes to the city's at-large voting system to remedy an alleged vio- lation of the VRA). 126. Black voters have challenged other discrim- inatory Alabama voting laws under Section 2 of the VRA and the Constitution in federal court. See, e.g., People First of Alabama v. Merrill (\"People First \"), 491 F. Supp. 3d 1076, , 695 F. Supp. 517, 530 (M.D. Ala. 1988). For example, the Supreme Court struck down Alabama's discriminatory misdemeanant disfranchisement law, Hunter v. Underwood , 471 U.S. 222 (1985), and a state law permitting certain discriminatory annexations, Pleasant Grove v. United States , 479 U.S. 462, 466-67 (1987). 127. Even in the wake of Shelby County v. Holder , Alabama is the only state in the nation where federal courts have ordered more than one political subdivision to be re-subjected to preclearance review under Section 3(c) of the VRA. See Jones , 2019 WL 7500528, at *4-5; Allen 13- 0107, 2014 WL 12607819, at *2 (S.D. Ala. Jan. 13, 2014). Senate Factor 5: Black Alabamians Continue to Bear the Effects of Past Socioeconomic Discrimination which Hi nders their Ability to Participate Effectively in the Political Process 128. Alabama has a long and well documented history of official and private discrimination which predates the state's admission to the union and has been well documented by the federal courts since at least the 1960s. As one fede ral court explained, Ala- bama's \"unrelenting historical agenda, spanning from the late 1800s to [today], to keep its black citizens eco- nomically, socially, and politically downtrodden, from the cradle to the grave.\" Dillard , 640 F. Supp. at 1357. JA112 129. As a result of the history of official and pri- vate discrimination in Alabama, Black Alabamians have a lower socioeconomi c status and lag behind white residents in many crucial aspects of public life, including employment, income, educational attain- ment, and access to health ca re. Black Alabamians also disproportionately bear the brunt of the consequences of the state's criminal legal system. All of this discrim- ination and its vestiges hinder Black Alabamians' abil- ity to effectively participate in the political process. 130. Alabama's history of denying Black people equal access to education persisted long after the Su-preme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education . In 1956, after a federal court ordered the segregated University of Alabama to admit a Black woman named Autherine Lucy, white people gathered on campus, burned a cross, and marched through town chanting, \"Hey, hey, ho, ho, Autherine has got to go!\" Frye Gail-lard, Cradle of Freedom: Alabama and the Movement that Changed America , 40 (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2004). 131. Desegregation litigation continues in Ala- bama today. A December 2014 report found that 54 Al-abama school districts remain under desegregation orders today as they still have not satisfied their con- stitutional obligations to in tegrate public schools and eliminate the vestiges of racial discrimination. People First , 491 F. Supp. 3d at 1108. For example, in 2018, in a case challenging the atte mpt by the City of Garden- dale, which is 85% white, to form a school district sep- arate from Jefferson County's more racially diverse JA113 district, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a finding that \"race was a motivating factor\" in the city's effort. Stout v. Jefferson Cnty. Bd. of Ed. , 882 F.3d 988, 1007-1009 2018). 132. Alabama's constitution still contains lan- guage that mandates separa te schools for Black and white students after a majority of voters rejected re- peal attempts in 2004 and 2012. Although the provi- sion has not been enforceable for decades, its underlying prejudice continue s to shape ongoing edu- cational inequality. 133. Alabama was the first st ate ever to be sub- jected to a statewide injunction prohibiting the state from failing to disestablish its racially dual school sys-tem. Lee v. Macon Cty. Bd. of Ed. , 267 F. Supp. 458 (M.D. Ala.), aff 'd 389 U.S. 215 (1967). The order re- sulted from the court's findin g that the State Board of Education, through Governor George Wallace, had pre- viously wielded its powers to maintain segregation across the state. Id. For decades, state officials ignored their duties under the statewide desegregation order. See Lee v. Lee Cnty. Bd. of Educ. , 963 F. Supp. 1122, 1128-30 (M.D. Ala. 1997). The st ate did not satisfy its obligations to remedy the vest iges of segregation under this order until as late as 2007. Lee v. Lee County Bd. of Educ. , 476 F. Supp. 2d 1356 (M.D. Ala. 2007). 134. Alabama's institutions of higher education similarly remain plagued by the \"vestiges of segrega-tion,\" decades after Alabama colleges and universities were court-ordered to desegregate. Knight v. Alabama , JA114 787 F. Supp. 1030 (N.D. Ala. 1991). In 1991, a trial court in Knight v. Alabama found that Alabama re- mained obligated to eliminate the lingering and con- tinued effects of segregation and discrimination in the University of Alabama and Auburn University, as well as their proposed satellites, to try to recruit Black stu- dents to those schools and to recruit white students to the state's Historically Bl ack Colleges and Universi- ties (HBCUs). In 1995, the trial court issued a remedial decree analogous to the statewide injunction issued in Lee v. Macon , the implementation of which the court would oversee for over a decade. Knight v. State of Ala. , 900 F. Supp. 272 (N.D. Ala. 1995). And Alabama did not satisfy its obligations under the Knight order until as late as 2006. Knight v. Alabama , 469 F. Supp. 2d 1016 (N.D. Ala. 2006). 135. Today, after increasing for many years, Black student enrollment in the state's higher educa-tion institutions has drastica lly declined. For example, Black enrollment at Auburn University peaked 14 years ago with Black studen ts making up 8.7 percent of the student body. This ye ar, the number of Black stu- dents in the freshman class at Auburn was a mere 3.2%. Drake Pooley, Why Has Black Enrollment Fallen at an Elite Southern University , N.Y. Times (Sept. 17, 2021). 136. In 2016, all 76 of the schools labeled \"fail- ing\" by Alabama were majority-Black schools and Black students constitute d 91% of those Alabama stu- dents who were enrolled in \"failing\" public schools. JA115 137. More than 16% of Black adults in Alabama over the age of 25 have not completed high school, com- pared to 11.4% of white adults. For the same age group, only 17.3% of Black Alabamians hold a bachelor's de-gree or a higher qualification, compared to 28.3% of white adults. U.S. Census Bureau, Table S0201, 1-year 2018 American Community Survey 2018. 138. Alabama also has a persistent history of denying its Black residents equal access to employ-ment opportunities. More than one quarter (27.7%) of Black Alabamians live in poverty compared to only 11.3% of white Alabamians. Id. 139. The unemployment rate among Black peo- ple over the age of 16 in Alabama is more than double the rate among white residents of the same age. And of those adults who are emp loyed, Black Alabamians are more likely to work in lower paying jobs than white workers: 20.7% of Black empl oyees work in service oc- cupations compared to 14.8% of whites. Id. 140. In Alabama, Black households also have fewer economic resources. The median household in- come for Black families is $33,503 compared to $58,257 for white households. Id. 141. Black Alabamians are significantly more likely to rent their home and to lack a vehicle than white Alabamians. About one in eight Black house- holds (12.7%) lack access to a vehicle, while only 3.9% of white households lack a vehicle. Id. While 76.1% of white Alabamians are homeowners, only 49.9% of Black Alabamians own their homes. Id. JA116 142. About 19% of Black households lack a com- puter, smartphone, or tablet versus only about 11% of white households. Id. Black families are also less likely to have broadband internet access-29.6% compared to 17.2% of white households. Id. 143. Rampant and overt discrimination in edu- cation works in tandem in Alabama with discrimina- tion against Black people in employment. In 2019, there were 2,108 claims of employment discrimination submitted to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") from Alabama, of which 45.1% were racially based\u2014the highest percentage of any state in the United States. U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 2019 EEOC Charge Receipts for AL, https://www.eeoc.gov/statistics/enforcement/ charges-by-state/AL; United States Census Bureau, Quick Facts, http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/ PST045215/00,01. Alabama's race-based claims ac- counted for 2.9% of the raci ally based claims received by the EEOC in the entire country and Alabama's color-based claims represe nted 2.2% of the EEOC's color-based claims in the country, even though in 2010 Alabama accounted for only 1.7% of the national pop- ulation. 144. Income and education are independently important, but both also have a significant impact on political participation rate s, which remains persis- tently lower among Black than among white Alabami- ans. JA117 145. Racial discrimination also finds expression in the healthcare system. Alabama has one of the high- est maternal mortality rates in the country. In 2019, the infant mortality rate for Black infants was 12.0 deaths per 1,000 live births, which is more than twice the white infant mortality rate of 5.6 deaths. Ala. Public Health, Alabama Infant Mortality Rate Shows Slight Uptick in 2019 , Dec. 16, 2020, https://www. alabamapublichealth.gov/news/2020/12/16.html. As a gynecologic oncologist in Mobile recently stated, \"It is more lethal to be Black and pregnant in Alabama than in some poor countries.\" Eyal Press, A Preventable Can- cer Is on the Rise in Alabama , The New Yorker (Mar. 30, 2020), https://www.newyork er.com/magazine/2020/04/ 06/a-preventable-cancer-is-on-the-rise-in-alabama. 146. The life-expectancy of Black Alabamians (72.9 years) is significantly shorter than that of whites (76 years). In Alabama's Black Belt, researchers have found that Black women, compared to white women, are more than twice as likely to die from cervical can- cer. Id. 147. In Lowndes County, scientists at the Na- tional School of Tropical Me dicine at Baylor College of Medicine documented higher rates of hookworm infections among residents from exposure to raw sewage and inadequate wastewater management. A disease long thought to have been eradicated in the United States, hookworm infections cause anemia, iron deficiencies, cognitive delay, and stunted growth in children. The peer-reviewed study published in the American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene JA118 found that more than one in three Lowndes County residents tested positive for traces of hookworm. Equal Justice Initiative, Researchers Find Hookworm Infec- tion Linked to Extreme Poverty in Rural Alabama , https://eji.org/news/researchers-find-hookworm-infection- linked-extreme-poverty-rural-alabama/. 148. On November 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice announced an investigation into the wastewater disposal and infectious disease and out-breaks programs of the Alabama Department of Public Health and the Lowndes County Health Department. The investigation is examining whether the Alabama and Lowndes County Health Departments operate their onsite wastewater disposal program and infec- tious diseases and outbreaks program in a manner that discriminates against Black residents in violation of Title VI of the Civ il Rights Act of 1964. See U.S. Dep't of Justice Office of Public Affairs, Justice Depart- ment Announces Environmental Justice Investigation into Alabama Department of Public Health and Lowndes County Health Department (last updated Nov. 9, 2021), https://www.justice. gov/opa/pr/justice-department- announces-environmental-justice-investigation-alabama- department-public. 149. The COVID-19 public health crisis that be- gan in 2019 and the deaths associated with the novel and deadly respiratory virus have fallen most heavily on Black Alabamians as a result of centuries of dis- crimination against Black people in all manners of life in Alabama, including in health, income, and em- ployment. Kesha Moore, COVID-19 Vaccinations In JA119 Alabama: Protecting and Perpetuating a Racial Divide, NAACP Legal Defense Fund (Apr. 2, 2021), https:// www.naacpldf.org/naacp-publicationsildf-blog/covid-19- vaccinations-in-alabama-protecting-and-perpetuating- a-racial-divide/. The continued effects of discrimination in Alabama are further evidenced by the fact that de- spite Black Alabamians having the highest rates of COVID-19 cases and disproportionately accounting for COVID-19 deaths. The COVID Tracking Project Alabama: All Race & Ethnicity Data , The Atlantic, https://covidtracking.com/dataistate/alabama/race- ethnicity (last updated March 7, 2021). Senate Factor 6: Overt and Subtle Racial Appeal's Continue in Political Campaigns 150. In the last decade, both overt and subtle racial appeals have defined political campaigns in Alabama. In 2011, at a town hall meeting, Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks stated that \"[he] will do anything short of shooting them [undocumented immigrants]\" to remove them from the United States. 151. In the 2017 special electi on for the U.S. sen- ate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, then-candidate Roy Moore told a group of people in Jackson, Alabama that the VRA created new rights and \"today we've got a problem.\" When asked to speak about a time when America was great, Moore replied, \"I think it was great at the time when families were united\u2014even though we had slavery\u2014they cared for one another . . . Our families were strong, our country had direction.\" JA120 152. In the 2018 election for Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, at least two campaign ads run by Chief Justice Tom Parker were characterized by racial appeals. In one of his campaign ads, Chief Jus-tice Parker, a white Republic an, declared that he op- poses \"the leftist mob tr[ying] to destroy our society\" and featured a clip of Congresswoman Maxine Waters. Ala. State Conference of NAACP , 2020 WL 583803, at *56. A court recently found that this statement along- side images of Congresswoman Waters, i.e., a Black congresswoman from California who had no reason to appear in an ad for an Alabama judicial election, shows that \"one of the motives of the ad was to draw attention to race.\" Id. In another of Justice Parker's ads, he tar- geted immigrant communities: \"It's an invasion. What happens if they make it to Alabama?\" Id. The ad then showed what appeared to be people of color trying to cross the southern border and concluded with a decla- ration that Justice Parker \"stand[s] up for what we be-lieve\" and \"stand[s] with us.\" Id. Senate Factor 7: Black Alabamians Remain Woefully Underrepresented in Public Office 153. Black people in Alabama remain under- represented, as a proportion of the population, in pub- lic office. 154. Even though Black people comprise approx- imately 27% of Alabama's popu lation, only approximately 14% of Alabama's congressional rep- resentatives is Black. This number of majority-Black JA121 congressional districts has remained constant since 1992, before which there had never been a Black con- gressional representative from Alabama in the twenti- eth century. 155. None of the current statewide elected offi- cials are Black. Only two Bl ack people have ever been elected to statewide office. In both instances, the office was associate justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. In 1982 and 1988, the late Justice Oscar W. Adams, Jr. was elected to two consecut ive terms; and, in 1994, Jus- tice Ralph D. Cook won an unopposed statewide elec- tion. In 2000, both Justice Cook and the then-recently appointed Justice John England, a Black person, lost elections to white candidates. 156. As of 2015, there were 757 local Black elected officials in Alabama, making up only 16.7% of elected offices. 157. Alabama has never had a Black governor or Black senator representing the state in the U.S. Sen-ate. 158. There are currently no Black Republicans in either the state House of Representatives or the state Senate or in any statewide elective positions. Senate Factor 8: Elected Officials are Unresponsive to the Need s of Black Alabamians 159. Black Alabamians' lack of representation in public office has contributed to the failure of elected officials to respond to the particularized needs of the JA122 Black community. The Alabama Legislature rejected requests to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act despite the racial gap in insurance coverage. Expanding Medicaid would have insured an additional 220,000 Alabamians, particularly benefiting Black res- idents. This disparity in healthcare and insurance cov- erage contributed to the vulnerability of Black Alabamians when the novel coronavirus surfaced in early 2020. People First , 491 F. Supp. 3d at 1109. 160. Black residents in Alabama have the high- est rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the state. As the pandemic has progressed, racial disparities in COVID-19 vaccine access have also become clear. This is a result of both inefficien cies in vaccine distribution and deliberate choices by st ate and local administra- tors to overlook majority Black communities. Kesha Moore, COVID-19 Vaccinations In Alabama: Protecting And Perpetuating A Racial Divide , NAACP LEGAL DEF. & in-alabama-protectin g-and-perpetuating-a-racial-divide/. 161. In Birmingham, the Alabama Regional Medical Services (ARMS) reported geographic discrep-ancies in the government's distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. The state distributed doses of the vaccine to affluent white suburbs as early as January 2021, while the ARMS, a health clinic that primarily serves a lower-income Black community in Birmingham, did not receive its first doses of COVID-19 vaccines until March 8, 2021. JA123 162. Black Alabamians' lack of access to vaccina- tions was also observed in Mobile County, where 14 of the 18 state vaccination sites were located in neighbor- hoods with a larger white population. 163. Alabama's elected officials have also been unresponsive to the needs of Black Alabamians in other areas of government services. In 2014, following the Supreme Court's decision in Shelby County v. Holder , Alabama's photo identification law went into effect; and in 2015, the State announced that it was closing 31 of 75 driver license offices throughout Ala- bama. The planned closures overwhelmingly affected Black Alabamians, as the State specifically concen- trated closures in the Black Belt. This decision was ul- timately reversed as part of a settlement after the U.S. Department of Transportation determined that the closures had discriminated against Black people in vi- olation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. See Mem. Agreement Between the U.S. Department of Transpor- tation and the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency (Dec. 22, 2016), https://www .transportation.gov/sites/ dot.gov/files/docs/ALEAUSDOTSigned MOA_O.PDF. Congressional Districts 1, 2, 3, and 7 Are Racial Gerrymanders 164. Race was the predominant factor in draw- ing CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7, and the Legislature's use of race was not narrowly tailored to comply with the Section 2 of the VRA or any other compelling governmental interest. The Legislature subordinated traditional JA124 race-neutral districting principles, including compact- ness, contiguity, respect for maintaining whole coun- ties and communities of actual shared interest, to racial considerations. 165. In the HB 1 plan signed by the Governor, the BVAP in CD 1 is 25.6%, the BVAP in CD 2 is 30.1%, and the BVAP in CD 3 is 25%. In drawing these dis- tricts, the Committee cracked Black voters between CDs 1, 2, and 3, despite having sufficient numbers and being geographically compact enough to form an addi- tional majority-Black opportunity district. Race was the predominant factor in drawing these districts, as evident by how the boundaries cut through Black com- munities. 166. Under HB 1, for example, the City of Mont- gomery and Montgomery County, which has a Black population of 54.7%, are inexplicably split between CDs 2 and 7. 167. HB 1 bizarrely divide s Black communities of shared interests residi ng in Alabama's Black Belt region into multiple congressional districts. The Black Belt is made up of those majority-BVAP (or near ma-jority-BVAP) counties that run through central Ala- bama and have a centuries-long shared culture and history of slavery, agriculture, civil rights activism, and poverty. Yet, HB 1 neatly sp lits the Black population in the eastern Black Belt in tw o at the border of CDs 2 and 3 with Bullock and Barbour Counties in CD 2 and Macon and Russell Counties in CD 3. JA125 168. CD 3 contains Macon County, which has a Black population of 82.6% and is home to the educa- tional heart of the Black B elt: the historically Black college Tuskegee University. Clarke County in the Black Belt with its signific ant Black populations is in CD 7, whereas Conecuh County, another Black Belt County, is in CD 2. JA126 169. While CDs 1, 2, and 3 use race as a predom- inant factor in drawing th eir boundaries by cracking the Black population across the three districts, CD 7 does so by unnecessarily pack ing Black voters into that district. CD 7 has existed in roughly its current form since 1992, when a federal court drew it as a majority Black district to resolve allegations of malapportion- ment and that Alabama had violated the VRA. As a re- sult, for the first time since Reconstruction, Black voters in CD 7 were able to elect their candidate of choice-Earl F. Hilliard, a Black man\u2014to Congress. To- day, CD 7 is represented by Terri Sewell, a Black woman first elected there in 2010. 170. But the three judge court that drew CD 7 as a majority-Black district in 1992 expressly declined to conduct an analysis of racially polarized voting, the Gingles preconditions, or the totality of the circum- stances in drawing CD 7 as a 65% or more majority-Black district. Wesch , 785 F. Supp. at 1498-99. 171. Moreover, when the Legislature attempted to draw its own 1992 congressional plan and submitted that plan for preclearance review, the U.S. Attorney General objected under Section 5 of the VRA. See U.S. Dep't of Justice Ltr. to Ala. Att'y General Evans, Mar. 27, 1992, https://www.justice.g ov/sites/default/files/crt/ legacy/2014/05/30/AL-1880.pd f. Because Alabama failed to enact or preclear an alternative congressional plan, the Wesch court's plan remained in effect. 172. After the 2000 and 2010 censuses, the Leg- islature continued to draw CD 7 in a manner JA127 consistent with the 1992 plan adopted by the Wesch court. As a result, CD 7 in the state's 2011 redistricting plan was still unnecessarily packed, with a BVAP of 63.57%. Alabama never conducted the analyses re-quired by the VRA or the Constitution to determine whether maintaining the core of CD 7 or a Black pop- ulation of 63% therein was necessary to comply with the VRA, nor did Alabama consider Black legislators' proposals in 2011 to draw a second Black district. 173. Today, the core of CD 7 remains the same as it was drawn in 1992. CD 7 includes Choctaw, Dallas, Greene, Hale, Lowndes, Marengo, Pickens, Perry, Sum-ter, and Wilcox counties, as well as portions of Clarke, Jefferson, Montgomery, and Tuscaloosa counties. The BVAP in CD 7 is 55.3%. Th e BVAP decline from the previous decade comes from population loss in the Black Belt, rather than any legislative efforts to ad- dress racial gerrymandering in CD 7. 174. In recent litigation, Alabama admitted that CD 7\u2014which remains in similar form now as it did then\u2014\"appears to be racially gerrymandered, with a finger sticking up from the black belt for the sole pur- pose of grabbing the black population of Jefferson County. Defendant does not believe that the law would permit Alabama to draw that district today if the fin- ger into Jefferson County was for the predominate pur-pose of drawing African American voters into the district.\" Secretary of State Merrill's Pretrial Brief, Chestnut v. Merrill , No. 2:18-CV-00907-KOB (N.D. Ala. Oct. 28, 2019), ECF No. 101 at 11. JA128 175. Based on expert simula tions, which looked at factors like racial demographics, partisan voting patterns and analyzed various potential district com- binations along racial and partisan lines, it is clear that race was a primary driver and the most signifi- cant factor in creating district lines. Expert simula- tions also show that CD 7 is more of an extreme racial outlier than a partisan outlier. That is, the simulations show that race accounts for the drawing of the lines in CD 7 above and beyond partisan voting patterns. 176. No compelling governmental interest, in- cluding compliance with Section 2 of the VRA, justifies the use of race to pack Black voters into CD 7 and to crack Black voters across CDs 1, 2, and 3. Under HB 1, the BVAP in CD 7 is 55.3%, which is still higher than necessary for Black voters to elect candidates of choice and appears to have been drawn with the mistaken le- gal belief that the BVAP and district boundaries should be altered as little as possible. Rep. Pringle fur- ther admitted that no racial-polarization or effective- ness analysis had been conducted by the Legislature regarding CD 7 or with respect to the redrawing of any redistricting plans. Instead, CD 7 was drawn by chang- ing the previous version of the district, which Alabama admits was a racially gerrymander, as little as possible except to equalize populations. Thus, CD 7 is not nar- rowly tailored to comply with the VRA or any other compelling state interest. JA129 The Congressional Map s in HB 1 is the Product of Intentional Racial Discrimination 177. Prior to the 1990 census, Alabama never had a congressional district that allowed Black Ala- bamians any substantial influence and certainly not the ability to elect candidates of choice until litigation. As noted above in \u00b6 31, VRA litigation brought by Black voters in the 1990 cyc le resulted in the drawing of CD 7 as a majority-Black district. But the court that drew this majority-Black district did not conduct a Sec- tion 2 analysis. Wesch , 785 F. Supp. at 1498-99. Rather the court cited the parties' stipulation that it was pos- sible to draw a Black district, id., and, thereafter, adopted a legislative proposal for CD 7 drawn by State Sen. Larry Dixon. Id. at 1495. 178. The Legislature did en act a congressional redistricting plan with on e majority-Black in 1992 during the Wesch litigation. But the Wesch court re- solved to adopt its own pl an and create a majority- Black CD 7 out of a concern that the state's plan would not be able to obta in the necessary VRA pre- clearance in time for the then-upcoming election deadlines. Id. at 1500. 179. The court was correct to worry about this timing. The U.S. Attorney General did in fact object un- der Section 5 of the VRA to the Legislature's 1992 Con- gressional plan. The Attorney General found that the legislative plan was the product of intentional racial discrimination because it drew only one majority- Black district and \"fragmente d\" the rest of the Black JA130 population across the state to dilute the Black vote. U.S. Dep't of Justice Ltr. to Ala. Att'y General Evans, Mar. 1992, https://www.j ustice.gov/sites/default/ files/crt/legacy/2014/05/30/ AL-1880.pdf. In the objec- tion letter, the U.S. Attorney General noted a \"concern\" of the Black community t hat \"an underlying principle of the Congressional redistricting was a predisposition on the part of the state p olitical leadership to limit black voting potential to a single district.\" Id. Thus, be- cause the state did not enact or obtain preclearance for an alternate plan, the Wesch court's plan remained in effect. 180. Troublingly, however, the Wesch court's plan creating a majority-Black CD 7 was also potentially in- fected by the Legislature's discriminatory motive. This is because the court plan was based on a CD 7 map drawn by Sen. Dixon. Wesch , 785 F. Supp. at 1495. And Sen. Dixon had a contemporaneous history of hostility towards Black voters. See Greater Birmingham Minis- tries v. Sec 'y of State of Ala. , 992 F.3d 1299, 1306 (11th Cir. 2021) (quoting statements made by Sen. Dixon about Black voters in 1995, 2001, and 2010); People First , 491 F. Supp. 3d at 1106 (noting that, in the 1990s, Sen. Dixon had \"insisted that only Black voters engaged in voter fraud\"). 181. Following the Justice Department's objec- tion under Section 5 of the VRA to the discriminatory purpose embodied in the Legislature's 1992 congres- sional plan, neither Alabama, nor any federal court ever acted to correct this discrimination. See Wesch , 6 F. 3d at 1468-69. JA131 182. Rather, in the subsequent 2000 and 2010 re- districting cycles, the Legislature simply continued to reenact the same core district for CD 7 with only slight modifications to address population shifts. The Legis-lature did so with the same discriminatory motive of limiting Black electoral success to CD 7, while frag- menting the remainder of the BVAP in Alabama in a manner designed to protect white candidates. For in- stance, in the 2000 cycle, the Democratic-controlled Legislature packed CD 7, and cracked the remaining Black population into majority-white districts in a manner designed to bolste r and protect white Demo- cratic congressmen. In the 2010 cycle, the Republican Legislature continued to pa ck CD 7 while minimizing the number of Black voters residing in the other dis- tricts to favor white Republican candidates. Further, the 2010 congressional plan, which HB 1 is based on, was drawn by State Sen. Scott Beason who, like Sen. Dixon, has a history of discrimination. See McGregor , 824 F. Supp. 2d at 1344-48. Regardless of the party in power then, race\u2014not partisanship\u2014has driven Ala- bama's congressional redistricting decisions. 183. The Legislature made these decisions de- spite requests from Black legislators and voters in each redistricting cycle since 1990 to unpack CD 7 and draw two Black-majority districts. 184. In 2021 cycle, the congressional maps in HB 1 likewise disregarded public input which supported the creation of a second Black opportunity district. The maps were introduced a mere day before they were passed out of committee on a vote that fell along racial JA132 lines. In the State House, the majority party cut the floor debate on the congressional maps short and pre- vented the Legislative Bl ack Caucus members from formally introducing Plaintiffs' letter and demonstra-tive plan containing two majority-Black districts ( su- pra \u00b6 89) into the House record for a formal vote. Nonetheless, the Black Caucus members were able to submit Plaintiffs' plan and letter containing a racial- polarization analysis into the clerk's official legislative record for the day. 185. In the Senate, Sen. Smitherman, Sen. Sin- gleton, and Sen. map\u2014that com- plied with the state's redistricting criteria and in- cluded either two majority-Black districts or two \"opportunity\" districts with BVAPs over 40%. Racial- polarization analyses showed that these maps would give Black voters the opport unity to elect candidates of choice. But the Legislature rejected these maps along racial lines. 186. Indeed, despit e the submission of three maps proving otherwise, Sen. McClendon claimed that \"It's impossible to draw two congressional dis- tricts that are majority minority people. You can't do it, try how you may, and so that's the problem. If you go for two districts, the wa y folks are just distributed in Alabama, you put the one pretty certain district at risk.\" Mike Cason, Alabama lawmakers give final ap- proval to new congressional districts , Ala. Media Group, Nov. 3, 2021, http s://www.al.com/news/2021/11/ JA133 alabama-senate-rejects-plan- for-new-swing-congressional- district.html. \u00b6\u00b6 51-55, Sen. McClendon conducted no racial-polarization analysis, nor any other publicly relea sed analysis to determine whether creating two majority-Black or Black-oppor-tunity districts might \"put the one pretty certain [CD 7] at risk.\" 188. Even with the efforts of the Black Caucus, the congressional maps in HB 1 were passed out of the Legislature and then signed by the Governor a week afterwards with minimal debate, votes, or opportunity for public input on alternative maps containing two Black districts. 189. Despite its options, the Legislature simply continued to use race to ma intain the core of the 1992 redistricting plan for CD 7, even though that plan was drawn for the discriminatory purpose of limiting Black voter influence. HB 1 packs CD 7 in a manner not re-quired by the VRA and cracks the remaining Black community by placing majority-Black counties into multiple congressional districts in which Black voters are no more than 30% of the voting-age population. JA134 CLAIMS FOR RELIEF Count One: Section 2 of the VRA, Vote Dilution HB 1 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301 (Vote Dilution) 190. The relevant allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs are alleg ed as if fully set forth herein. 191. Voting in Alabama is racially polarized. Black voters in Alabama are politically cohesive and overwhelmingly support the same candidates in con- gressional and statewide elections. By contrast, the white majority usually votes as a bloc in congressional and statewide elections with the usual result of defeat- ing Black voters' candidates of choice. 192. In addition, Black voters in Alabama are sufficiently numerous and geographically compact enough to form two majority-BVAP Congressional dis-tricts. 193. Moreover, considering the totality of the cir- cumstances in Alabama, Plaintiffs, Black Alabamians and organizations of which th ey are a part, have less opportunity than other members of the Alabama elec-torate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice to Congress. 194. Among other factors, there is a long history and ongoing pattern of discrimination in voting, edu- cation, employment, health, and other areas in Ala-bama that effect Black voters ability to participate equally in the political process, Black voters are JA135 underrepresented in the state's congressional delega- tion, recent political congressional and other cam- paigns have been characte rized by overt and subtle racial appeals, the Legislature and white Congress-members have been unresponsive to the particular concerns of Black voters, and the state's justifications for decades of cracking Black voters across districts and packing of Black vote rs into CD7 are tenuous. 195. These facts, as well as the particular cir- cumstances surrounding the adoption of HB 1 by the Alabama legislature, demonstrate that the Legislature adopted the 2021 congressional redistricting plan with the intent and the result of diluting Black voter strength in violation of Section 2 of the VRA, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301. 196. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law other than the judicial relief sought in this case. The failure to temporarily and permanently enjoin the con- duct of elections under HB 1 and order the creation of two majority-minority congressional districts in CD 1, 2, 3, and 7, will irreparably harm Plaintiffs by subject- ing them to racial vote dilution. Count Two: Racial Gerrymandering HB 1 violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution U.S. Const. amend. MV; 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983 197. The relevant allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs are alleg ed as if fully set forth herein. JA136 198. The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides in r elevant part: \"No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the priv- ileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 2. 199. Race was the predominant factor in the Al- abama Legislature's drawing and enactment of HB 1, creating and enacting CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7. The Legisla- ture subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles, including compactness, contiguity, respect for maintaining whole counties and communities of ac- tual shared interest, to racial considerations. 200. The predominate consideration of race in the drawing of CD 1, 2, 3, 7 and the \"cracking\" and \"packing\" Black voters across those districts is not re- quired to comply with the VRA and indeed prevents fulfillment of the VRA's requirements. The predomi-nate racial motive in the drawing of CD 1, 2, 3, 7 is not justified by a compelling state interest. 201. As a result, CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7 each violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amend- ment to the United States Constitution. JA137 Count Three: Intentional Discrimination HB 1 violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution U.S. Const. amend. XIV; 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983; 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301 202. The relevant allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs are alleg ed as if fully set forth herein. 203. The equal protection clause of the Four- teenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution forbids states from enacting laws t hat for which a racially dis- criminatory intent or purpose is a motivating factor and which produce discriminatory results. This in-cludes laws that use race as a means to gain political or partisan advantage. 204. One of the motivating factors in the draw- ing and passage of HB 1 was a racially discriminatory purpose. Specifically, HB 1 was drafted and passed at least in part to minimize th e political power of Black Alabamians by limiting their ability to influence con- gressional elections to a sing le district out of seven. 205. HB 1 will also produce discriminatory re- sults for Black Alabamians\u2014a fact Defendants were well aware of when drafting, passing, and beginning to implement the new congressional maps. Indeed, alt- hough Black Alabamians make up over 27% of the State's voting-age population, this provides them polit- ical influence in only one out of seven congressional districts, or approximately 14% of the districts in the State. It will also limit their influence to the specific region of the State containi ng CD 7 despite substantial JA138 clusters of Black Alabamians living in concentrated ar- eas of the State outside of CD 7. Defendants were aware that Black Alabamians could elect candidates of choice in two congressional di stricts in the state in a manner that complies with th e U.S. Constitution and federal law, yet purposefully drew the congressional maps to prevent this. 206. Moreover, other circumstantial evidence supports discriminatory purpose as a motivating fac-tor behind HB 1, including the Senate Factors outline above. For instance, Alabama has a well-documented and recent history of discri minating against Black Al- abamians in districting, es pecially in congressional and state legislative redistricting. 207. Alabama never had a congressional district that allowed Black Alabamians any substantial influ- ence and certainly not the ab ility to elect candidates of choice until litigation after the 1990 cycle resulted in the drawing of CD 7. As noted above at \u00b6 180, that dis- trict was first drawn crafted by Sen. Dixon, who had a history of overt hostility towards Black voters in Ala- bama. 208. Moreover, even afte r the Justice Depart- ment objected to the 1990 co ngressional re districting as the product of intention al racial discrimination, neither Alabama, nor any fede ral court ever acted to correct this discrimination. Rather, the Alabama Leg- islature simply continued to reenact the same packed CD 7 map in the 2000, 2010, and 2020 plans with only JA139 slight modifications to address malapportionment, but the same racially discriminatory intent and results. 209. In 2021, the Legislature ignored the re- peated requests from Black legislators and voters to unpack CD 7 and draw two Black-majority or oppor- tunity districts. Accordingly, HB l's congressional plan disregarded public input from the Black community, which supported creation of a second Black district; in- stead the plan protects white incumbents from run-ning in a Black-majority or Black-opportunity district while limiting Black voters in fluence to CD 7; the plan was introduced a mere day before it was passed out of committee on a vote that fell along racial lines; and then was passed out of the Legislature and signed by the Governor the following week after minimal debate and opportunity for public input as to the alternative plans put forward by Blac k legislators and voters. 210. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law other than the judicial relief sought in this case. The failure to temporarily and permanently enjoin the con-duct of elections under HB 1 and ordering of a remedial map will irreparably harm Plaintiffs by subjecting them to racially discriminatory districts for the next decade. PRAYER FOR RELIEF 211. WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully re- quest that the Court: JA140 A. Declare the challenged congressional districts adopted in HB 1 to be unconstitutional as vi- olating the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution as racial gerry-manders and as passed with discriminatory intent as a motivating factor; B. Declare the congressional districting plan adopted in HB 1 a violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; C. Preliminarily and permanently enjoin the De- fendants and their agents from holding elec-tions in the congressional districts adopted in HB 1 and any adjoining districts necessary to remedy the constitutional violations includ-ing, if necessary, delaying the primary filing date until the Court adopts a remedial plan for 2022 elections and/or holding special elec-tions; D. Order expedited hearings and briefing, con- sider evidence, and take any other action nec- essary for the Court to order a VRA-compliant plan for new congressional districts in Ala-bama. E. Set an immediate and reasonable deadline for the State of Alabama to adopt and enact a congressional redistricting plan that (1) in- cludes two majority-min ority districts, (2) does not dilute, cancel out, or minimize the voting strength of Blac k Alabamian voters or subject them to intentionally discriminatory districts, and (3) does not violate the VRA, federal and state constitutions, and other ap- plicable laws; JA141 F. Award Plaintiffs' their costs, expenses, and disbursements, and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in bring this pursuant to in accord- ance with 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10310(e) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988; G.

Plaintiff GBM was founded in 1969 in re- sponse to the challenges posed by the mid-twentieth century Civil Rights movement and its transformative impact in Birmingham, Alab ama, and across the United States. GBM describes itself as a multi-faith, multi-racial, non-profit membership organization that provides emergency services to people in need and en- gages people to build a strong, supportive, engaged community and a more just society for all people. 17.

F. The Alabama State Conference of the N.A.A.C.P . (\"Alabama NAACP\") 19. Plaintiff Alabama NAACP is the state confer- ence of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Inc. The Alabama NAACP is the old- est and considers itself one of the most significant civil rights organizations in Alabama, and it states that it works to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic equality of Blac k Americans and all other Americans. 20. The Alabama NAACP states that two of its central goals are to eliminate racial discrimination in the democratic process, and to enforce federal laws and constitutional provisions securing voting rights. The Alabama NAACP claims that it advances its goals in part by participating in lawsuits, and that it regularly engages in efforts to register and educate voters and encourages Black people to en gage in the political pro- cess by turning out to vote on Election Day.

Pringle led the Committee t hat was responsible for the preparation and development of redistricting plans for the State following the decennial census and presided over the meetings of the Committee. The Committee was tasked with making a \"co ntinuous study of the re- apportionment problems in Alabama seeking solutions thereto\" and reporting its investigations, findings, and recommendations to the Legislature as necessary for the \"preparation and formulation\" of redistricting plans for the Senate, House, and congressional JA149 districts in the State of Alabama. Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a7 29-2-51, 29-2-52. III. Demographics of Alabama A. Citizenship and Age by Race/Ethnicity 25. Alabama's population shifts between every census. 26. Between the 2010 and 2020 census, Ala- bama's population increased from 4,779,736 to 5,024,279, a 5.1 percent increase. IV. Alabama's Congressional Districts 27. From 1965 through 2013, Alabama was a covered jurisdiction under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, and Alabama's congressional plans there- fore had to be precleared by the U.S. Department of Justice or a three judge federal court in Washington, D.C. 28. Since 1973, Alabama has had seven congres- sional seats. For each of th e six congressional plans Al- abama has had since the 1970 census, including the plan enacted in 2021, the plan has included all of Mo-bile, Baldwin, Washington, and Monroe Counties in CD 1. Likewise, in each plan, CD 2 has included all of Conecuh, Butler, Crenshaw, Covington, Pike, Bullock, Barbour, Coffee, Dale, Geneva, Henry, and Houston Counties; and CD 3 has incl uded all of Calhoun, Cleburne, Talladega, Clay, Randolph, Tallapoosa, Chambers, Macon, Lee, and Russell Counties. JA150 A. The History of the Majority-Black Con- gressional District 7 29. In 1992, Black voters and others challenged the failure of the State Legislature to redistrict con- gressional seats after the release of the 1990 census under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Consti- tution and the lack of a majority-Black congressional district under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 30. On March 9, 1992, upon the stipulation of the parties, the three judge court ordered the creation of CD 7 as a majority-Black congressional district to re- solve the litigation. See Wesch v. Hunt , 785 F. Supp. 1491, 1498 (S.D. Ala.), aff 'd sub nom. Camp v. Wesch , 504 U.S. 902 (1992). 31. Concerning the parties to the case, the court noted as follows: \"The Intervenor-Plaintiffs, Michael Figures and others, are African-American citizens of the United States and the St ate of Alabama. They have been allowed to intervene in this litigation both on their own behalf and on behalf of all African-American citizens of the State of Alabama.\" Id. at 1494. 32. Under the 1992 Plan established by the Wesch court, Black people were 67.69% of the total res- idents of CD 7 and 63.58% of CD 7's age popu- lation (\"VAP\"). 785 F. Supp. at 1496. 33. The Wesch court did not cond uct a Section 2 analysis. Id. at 1498-99. Rather, the court cited the parties' stipulation that it was possible to draw a JA151 majority-Black VAP district, id., and, thereafter, adopted a legislative proposal for CD 7. Id. at 1495. 34. Prior to the Wesch court establishing the 1992 Plan, however, the State Legislature did enact Act No. 92-65 (1992), a congre ssional redistricting plan with one majority-Black district. 35. The Wesch court adopted its own plan and created a majority-Black CD 7 due to a concern that Act No. 92-65 would not obtain the required preclear- ance under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act in time for the then-upcoming election deadlines. 785 F. Supp. at 1500. 36. One of the plans submitted to the court had two majority-black districts. The court found: \"The Hil- liard an African-American population of 59.33% and 61.98% respectively. Although this plan was sub- mitted by the intervenors, they took the position that the Hilliard Plan probably provided obstacles of suffi-cient nature to cast doubt on their opportunity to elect candidates of their choic e in these districts.\" Id. at 1496. 37. Only two of the plans submitted by the par- ties achieved population equality, the \"Pierce Plan\" and the \"Reed Plan,\" each of which had a district that was more than 65% black population. Id. at 1495-96. Ac- cording to the Wesch court, the Pierce Plan was a \"mod- ification of a plan called the 'Larry Dixon Plan' which was considered by the Reapportionment Committee. JA152 The Pierce Plan modified the Larry Dixon Plan to some extent, but the basic format is similar.\" Id. at 1495. 38. The court found that the Pierce Plan that was ultimately adopted was superior to the Reed Plan because \"District 1 under th e Reed Plan includes Mo- bile County to the south and Tuscaloosa County to the north. District 2 under the Pierce Plan is largely com- posed of counties in the southeast corner of the state, while the Reed Plan's District 2 stretches from Mobile County, in the extreme southwest corner of the State, to Lee County, in east central Alabama. The Pierce Plan is superior to the Reed Plan in terms of compact-ness.\" Id. at 1496. 39. The Court also found that the Reed Plan split more counties and precincts than the Pierce Plan and that the Pierce Plan did a better job of preserving the core of districts and communities of interest. Id. at 1496-97. 40. On March 27, 1992, the U.S. Attorney Gen- eral objected to Act No. 9265 under Section 5 of the Vot- ing Rights Act. The Attorney General found that Act No. 92-65 was the product of intentional racial discrim- ination because it drew only one majority-Black dis- trict and \"fragmented\" the re st of the Black population in the state to dilute the Black vote. In the objection letter, the U.S. Attorney General noted a \"concern\" of the Black community that \"a n underlying principle of the Congressional redistricting was a predisposition on the part of the state p olitical leadership to limit black voting potential to a single district.\" JA153 41. During this time, the Department of Justice was applying a \"max-black\" policy. 42. Because the state did not obtain preclear- ance for Act No. 92-65 nor enact another plan, the Wesch court's 1992 Plan remained in effect for the re- mainder of the 1990s. 43. In each redistricting cycle from at least the 1990 census through the 2020 census, some Black leg-islators and voters have lobbied for plans that include two Black-majority districts. 44. After the establishment of CD 7 as a major- ity-Black district in the 1992 Plan, Earl Hillard be- came the first Black Alabamian to be elected to Congress in the Twentieth Century. 45. After the 2000 redistricting cycle, the State Legislature enacted the 2002 Plan wherein Black peo- ple constituted 62.389% of the total population and 58.327% of the voting age population under the 2000 census. 46. The 2002 Plan received preclearance under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. 47. In the general congressional elections of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008, Artur Davis, a Black Dem- ocrat, was elected in CD 7 after winning a majority of Black voters. 48. In each of the general congressional elections of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008, Representative Davis won election with no less than 74.9% of the vote. JA154 49. In the November 2010 general congressional election, Terri Sewell, a Black Democrat, was elected in CD 7 after winning a majority of Black voters. 50. In the November 2010 general congressional election, Representative Sewell won election in CD 7 with 72% of the vote, beating her white opponent by 45 points. 51. In 2010, CD 7 under the 2002 Plan had a Black voting-age population (\"BVAP\") of 60.11%. 52. After the release of the 2010 census, the State Legislature enacted the 2011 Plan. The 2011 Plan increased the BVAP of CD 7 to 60.91% any-part Black and 60.55% single-race Black, according to 2010 Census data. 53. In September 2011, the Alabama Attorney General's office sent a letter and related materials to the U.S. Department of Justice, which submitted the 2011 Plan for preclearance rev iew under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act (hereinafter, the \"submission let- ter\"). 54. The submission letter stated that the 2011 Plan \"preserves the voting strength of the African- American community\" and that the \"percentage of to-tal black and black voting age population in the new [2011] plan increased from the benchmark [2002 Plan] figures. That increase plainly cannot be regarded as retrogressive.\" 55. The submission letter likened the CD 7 in the 2011 Plan to the CD 7 in the \"1992 Wesch court plan JA155 and the [2002] plan\" because \"the new [2011] plan has one African-American majority district, District 7, which is located in the west central part of the state.\" 56. The submission letter did not include a racial polarization analysis or otherwise attempt to demon- strate that maintaining the effectiveness of CD 7 re-quired increasing the total Black or BVAP population in that district. 57. The 2021 Plan enacted in HB 1 contains one majority-Black district with a BVAP of 55.3% any-part Black and 54.22% single-ra ce Black under the 2020 census and assigns 30.86% of all single-race Black Al- abamians to CD 7. 58. CD 7 remains the only majority-BVAP con- gressional district in Alabama. 59. In the 2021 Plan, the State Legislature sought to maintain the core s of each congressional dis- trict as they were drawn in the 2011 Plan. 60. The Black Belt is named for the region's fer- tile black soil. The region has a substantial Black pop- ulation because of the many enslaved people brought there to work in the antebellum period. All the coun- ties in the Black Belt are majority- or near majority-BVAP. 61. The Black Belt includes the core counties of Barbour, Bullock, Butler, Choctaw, Crenshaw, Dallas, Greene, Hale, Lowndes, Macon, Marengo, Montgomery, Perry, Pickens, Pike, Russell, Sumter, and Wilcox. Clarke, Conecuh, Escambia, Monroe, and Washington JA156 counties are sometimes included within the definition of the Black Belt. 62. In recent litigation, Secretary Merrill stated that CD 7 \"appears to be racially gerrymandered, with a finger sticking up from th e black belt for the sole pur- pose of grabbing the black population of Jefferson County. Defendant does not believe that the law would permit Alabama to draw that district today if the fin- ger into Jefferson County was for the predominate pur-pose of drawing African American voters into the district.\" Secretary of State Merrill's Pretrial Brief, Chestnut v. Merrill , No. 2:18-CV-00907 (N.D. Ala. Oct. 28, 2019), ECF No. 101 at 11. B. Congressional Districts 1, 2, and 3 63. In 2010, CDs 1, 2, and 3 under the 2001 Plan contained a combined AP Black population of 629,911, which was 92.3% of the ideal total population for a sin- gle congressional district, calculated by dividing the to-tal population by the number of congressional districts. In 2010, CDs 1, 2, and 3 under the 2001 Plan contained a combined SR Black population of 615,896, which was 90.1% of the ideal total population for a single congres- sional district. This count in cludes Black voters in Mo- bile and Black voters in Anniston. 64. According to 2010 Cens us data, CDs 1, 2, and 3 under the 2011 Plan contained a combined any- part Black population of 57 5,923, which is 84.3% of the total population of an ideal congressional district. Those districts contained a combined single-race Black JA157 population of 561,978, which is 82.3% of the total pop- ulation of an ideal congressio nal district. This count in- cludes Black voters in Mobile and Black voters in Anniston. 65. The 2001 Plan split Montgomery County among two districts: CDs 2 and 3. The 2011 Plan split Montgomery County between three congressional dis- tricts: CDs 2, 3, and 7. Under the 2021 Plan, Montgom- ery County is split between two districts: CDs 2 and 7. C. State Board of Ed ucation (\"SBOE\") Plan 66. The Alabama SBOE is a nine-member body that sets education policy for Alabama's K-12 schools. The Governor serves as the president of the SBOE, and the remaining eight members are elected to the Board from single-member districts. 67. In 2021, Alabama adopted an eight-district SBOE Plan (the \"2021 SBOE Plan\") with two majority-Black districts, Districts 4 and 5. 68. According to 2020 Census data, District 4 is 51% BVAP, and District 5 is 51% BVAP. 69. In each election since 2011, a Black Demo- crat won a majority of Black voters and the election in Districts 4 and 5 of the SBOE. District 5 of the SBOE Plan connects the City of Mobile to the Black Belt Counties. JA158 V. The Process Leadin g to the Enactment of H.B. 1 A. Joint Legislative Committee's Stated Redistricting Criteria 70. On May 5, 2021, the Permanent Legislative Committee on Reapportionment (the \"Committee\")\u2014 the Committee responsible for preparing and develop-ing redistricting plans for the State following each de- cennial census\u2014enacted guidelines for the 2021 redistricting cycle. 71. The guidelines state that they are based on the requirements of the U.S. Constitution, Alabama Constitution, and policies that \"are embedded in the political values, traditions, customs, and usages of the State of Alabama.\" 72. The criteria for redistricting set by the Com- mittee begin with requirements under the U.S. Consti-tution and federal law, including compliance with the one-person, one-vote requirement. The Committee in- structed that Congressional districting maps \"shall have minimal population deviation\" and comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, meaning that dis- tricts have \"neither the purpose nor the effect of dilut-ing minority voting strength.\" 73. The Committee stated that districts cannot be drawn \"in a manner that subordinates race-neutral districting criteria to considerations of race, color, or membership in a language minority group, except that race, color, or membership in a language-minority JA159 group may predominate over race-neutral districting criteria to comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, provided there is a strong basis in evidence in sup- port of such a race-based choice.\" 74. Each district must also be \"contiguous and reasonably compact,\" under the criteria. 75. The criteria next require compliance with the Alabama Constitution, including that: a. Districts are \"drawn to reflect the democratic will of all the people concerning how their gov-ernments should be restructured\"; b. Districts are drawn based on total population except that voting-age population may be con- sidered to comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and other laws; c. The number of Senate districts is set at 35 and House districts at 105; d. All districts must be single-member districts; and e. All districts must be contiguous with each other. 76. The criteria require compliance with redis- tricting policies that are \"embedded in the political val-ues, traditions, customs, and usages of the State of Alabama . . . to the extent that they do not violate or subordinate the foregoing policies prescribed by the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Alabama,\" including: JA160 a. Avoiding contests between incumbents where possible; b. Permitting contiguity by water but not point- to-point or long-lasso contiguity; c. Respect for \"communities of interest, neigh- borhoods, and political subdivisions to the ex- tent practicable,\" with a community of interest \"defined as an area with recognized similarities of interests, including but not lim- ited to ethnic, racial, economic, tribal, social, geographic, or historical identities.\" d. Minimization of the number of counties in each district; and e. Preservation of the cores of existing districts. 77. The Committee's Redistricting Guidelines stated that \"In establishing legislative districts, the Reapportionment Committee shall give due considera-tion to all the criteria herein. However, priority is to be given to the compelling State interests requiring equality of population among districts and compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, as amended, should the requirements of those criteria conflict with any other criteria.\" B. The 2021 Legislative Process for Redis- tricting 78. On August 12, 2021, the U.S. Census Bureau released the results of the 2020 Census. JA161 79. Alabama's population grew by 5.1% between 2010 and 2020. 80. Using population estimates from the Census Bureau, the Committee, under the leadership of Sen. McClendon and Rep. Pringle, began to develop redis- tricting plans for congressional districts in May of 2021. See Ala. Code \u00a7 29-250(2). On ce census data was released in August, that work continued. 81. The Committee consists of members of both the State House and Senate, with the Speaker of the House appointing one House member from each of the seven congressional districts and four additional House members and the Lieu tenant Governor appoint- ing one Senator from each of the seven congressional districts and four additional Senators. See Ala. Code \u00a7 29-2-51(c). 82. The 2021 Reapportionment Committee in- cludes 21 members-15 white Republican members and six Black Democratic members. 83. All Committee meetings must be open to the public. The Committee Guidelines provide that \"All in- terested persons are encouraged to appear before the Reapportionment Committee and to give their com- ments and input regarding legislative redistricting. Reasonable opportunity will be given to such persons, consistent with the criteria herein established, to pre- sent plans or amendments redistricting plans to the Reapportionment Committee, if desired, unless such plans or amendments fail to meet the minimal criteria herein established.\" JA162 84. Between September 1 and 16, before the Committee released draft maps or proposals, the Leg- islative Reapportionment Office held 28 public hear- ings across the state. 85. Every hearing, except one that was held at 6:00 pm at the Statehouse in Montgomery, was held between the hours of 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. 86. On October 19, 2021, Plaintiffs the Alabama NAACP and Greater Birmingham Ministries and oth- ers sent a letter to the Alabama Permanent Committee on Reapportionment. 87. The letter sought to remind the Committee of obligations under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and highlighted what the Plaintiffs believed to be the Committee's obligation to conduct a racial-polarization analysis to ensure that the redistricting complied with the Voting Rights Act and that the race was used only in a narrowly tailored manne r to comply with a com- pelling state interest. 88. Governor Kay Ivey called the Special Legis- lative Session on redistricting in Alabama to begin on October 28, 2021. 89. On October 26, 2021, the Committee held its second public meeting of this redistricting cycle. The first public meeting was h eld in May 2021, when the Committee adopted redistricting guidelines. 90. A member of the Committee, Rep. Chris Eng- land, a Black legislator, published the proposed maps on Twitter on October 25, 2021. JA163 91. The Committee released the maps to the public on the day of the Committee meeting. 92. Many Committee members did not see the full proposed maps beyond their own districts and those surrounding their own district until the day be- fore their meeting. 93. Beyond the Committee, the Committee Co- Chairs and their staff met with each incumbent legis-lator or their staff either in person or online unless the legislator declined to meet. 94. Individual legislators only viewed and pro- vided feedback on draft maps of their districts and ad- joining districts, not maps of the entire state. 95. Mr. Dorman Walker has been the Commit- tee's lawyer for the 2011 and 2021 redistricting cycles. 96. Sen. McClendon explained that Mr. Walker told him that racial-polarization analysis was only done by Dr. M.V. \"Trey\" Hood III for state legislative districts where \"it looked like there might possibly be a racial issue.\" 97. No racial-polarization analysis was con- ducted for CD 7. 98. No racial-polarization analysis for any dis- tricts was provided to Committee members before or during the meeting. 99. Committee members only received demo- graphic and population data for each district. JA164 100. Neither Mr. Walker nor Dr. Hood, who con- ducted racial-polarization analysis for the state legis- lative districts, attended the Committee meeting. 101. Rep. Laura Hall, a Black legislator, moved to postpone any vote on the proposed maps until the Committee members and the public had more time to review the maps and accompanying racial-polarization analysis. 102. All the Black Democratic committee mem- bers voted in favor of Rep. Hall's motion, which failed because nearly all white Republican committee mem-bers voted against it. 103. Each of the maps passed out of Committee. 104. All the Black Democra tic members of the Committee voted against each of the maps. 105. The Special Legislativ e Session for redis- tricting began two days later, on October 28, 2021. 106. On October 29, 2021, the Alabama House State Government Committee met to discuss the Re-apportionment Committee's proposed districting plan for Alabama's U.S. House delegation. 107. The Committee gave the congressional map a favorable report. All the Black Democratic members of the Committee voted against the maps. 108. On. November 1, the full House considered the congressional map. JA165 109. The House passed the congressional map by a vote of 65-38. 110. On November 2, 2021, the Senate General Fund and Appropriations Committee considered the State House and congressional maps. 111. The Committee gave both maps a favorable report. All the Black members of the Committee, each of whom is a Democrat, voted against the maps. 112. The next day, November 3, 2021, the full Senate considered the congressional map. 113. Sen. Kirk Hatcher, a Black legislator, of- fered the demonstrative map prepared by Plaintiffs Greater Birmingham Ministries and the Alabama NAACP as a substitute map. He stated that this map sought to ensure \"that all Black Alabamians have an opportunity to elect their preferred congressional rep- resentatives.\" 114. Sen. Hatcher's substitute map failed an up- or-down vote. All Black Senators voted in favor of it. 115. The Senate tabled several other substitute maps. 116. The Senate passed the congressional map by a vote of 22-7. 117. All Black senators, each of whom is a Dem- ocrat, voted against the map. JA166 VI. Other Stipulated Facts 118. Numerous federal courts in Alabama have found that the state's elections were racially polarized at the time and locations at issue in their respective cases. See, e.g., Ala. State Conf. of NAACP v. Alabama , No. 2:16-CV-731-WKW, 2020 WL 583803, at *17 (M.D. Ala. Feb. 5, 2020) (accepting the undisputed statistical evidence proving the existence of racially polarized voting statewide); Jones v. Jefferson Cty. Bd. of Educ. , No. 2:19-cv-01821-MHH, 2019 WL 7500528, at *2 (N.D. Ala. Dec. 16, 2019) (finding t hat voting is racially po- larized in Jefferson County elections); United States v. McGregor , 824 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1345-46 & n.3 (M.D. Ala. 2011) (finding that voti ng is racially polarized across Alabama). 119. In 2008, Bobby Bright, a white Democrat, was elected to the U.S. House from CD 2. 120. From 1973 until 2008, white Democrats were elected to the U.S. House from CD 5. 121. In the November 2008 election, Democrats won three of Alabama's seven Congressional districts. White Democrats won in Districts 2 and 5. In the same election, John McCain, a white Republican candidate for President, won a majori ty of the votes statewide and won the most votes in six of the seven Congres- sional districts, including Districts 2 and 5. Barack Obama, a Black Democrat, received a majority of votes only in District 7. JA167 122. In 2013 and 2014, Burton LeFlore, a Black Democrat, ran for election to the U.S. House from CD 1, but both times LeFlore was defeated by Bradley Byrne, a white Republican, by wide margins. 123. In 2017, Doug Jones, a white Democrat, was elected to the U.S. Senate in Alabama. 124. In 2018, Black candidates for Lieutenant Governor, State Auditor, and the Public Service Com-mission lost statewide general elections to white can- didates. 125. In the Twentieth century, Black Alabami- ans have never elected a Blac k person to Congress out- side of the majority-Black CD 7, and only since 1992. 126. In congressional races in the current major- ity-white CDs 1, 2, and 3, Black candidates have never won election to Congress. 127. For example, in 2020 in District 1, white Re- publican candidate Rep. Bradley Byrne defeated Black Democratic candidate James Averhart by approxi- mately 29 percentage points in a district that was ap-proximately 25.7% BVAP. The same was true in 2018, with Rep. Byrne defeating Black and Black-preferred candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. by over 26 percentage points. 128. In 2020 in District 2, which is 30.6% BVAP, white Republican candidate Rep. Barry Moore de- feated Black Democratic candidate Phyllis Harvey- Hall by over 30 percentage points. In 2018 in District two, white Republican cand idate Rep. Martha Roby JA168 defeated Democratic candid ate Tabitha Isner by 23 percentage points. 129. In 2020 in District 3, which is 25.8% BVAP, white Republican candidate Rep. Mike Rogers de- feated Black Democratic c andidate Adia Winfrey by 35 percentage points. Similarly, in 2018, Rep. Rogers de- feated Democratic candidat e Mallory Hagan by over 27 percentage points. 130. Prior to 1960, the Legislature failed to reap- portion for 50 years. As a result, Alabama's entire leg- islative apportionment sche me was struck down for violating the principle of one person, one vote. Reyn- olds v. Sims , 377 U.S. 533, 568 (1964). On remand, a three judge court found that, in devising remedial maps to correct the malapportionment, the \"Legisla- ture intentionally aggregated predominantly Negro counties with predominantly white counties for the sole purpose of preventing the election of Negroes to [State] House membership.\" Sims v. Baggett , 247 F. Supp. 96, 108-109 (M.D. Ala. 1965). 131. Following Reynolds and the 1970 Census, the Legislature again failed to redistrict and a three judge federal court was forced to draw new district lines. Sims v. Amos , 336 F. Supp. 924, 940 (M.D. Ala. 1972). The court rejected the Alabama Secretary of State's proposed map because of its racially \"discrimi- natory effect\" on Black voters. Id. at 936. 132. In the 1980s, the United States Attorney General denied preclearance under the Voting Rights Act to maps drawn by the Legislature to redistrict JA169 State House and Senate maps because of their dis- criminatory effect on Black voters in Jefferson County and the Black Belt. U.S. Dep't of Justice Ltr. to Ala. Attorney General Graddick, May 6, 1982, https:// www.justice.gov/sites/defaul t/files/crt/legacy/2014/05/ 30/AL-1520.pdf. Shortly thereafter, a three judge court rejected Alabama's proposed interim remedial state maps in part because Alabam a's maps \"had the effect of reducing the number of 'safe' black districts\" in and near Jefferson County. Burton v. Hobbie , 543 F. Supp. 235, 238 (M.D. Ala. 1982). 133. After the 1990 census, the State entered a consent decree to resolve a Voting Rights Act lawsuit filed on behalf of Black voters. See Brooks v. Hobbie , 631 So.2d 883, 884 (Ala. 1993). 134. Most recently, after the 2010 census, Black voters and legislators successfully challenged 12 state legislative districts as unconstitutional racial gerry- manders. See Ala. Legis. Black Caucus v. Alabama , 231 F. Supp. 3d 1026, 1348-49 (M.D. Ala. 2017). 135. Today, Alabama has a majority-vote re- quirement in all primary elections. 136. Before the Civil War, Black people were barred from voting in the state. After the passage of the Reconstruction Acts and Amendments, Alabama was forced to allow Black men access to the franchise, and the 1867 Alabama Constitution granted every male person over the age of 21\u2014who satisfied the citi- zenship and residency requirements\u2014the right to vote. JA170 This meant that for the first time in Alabama's history, Black people voted and held public office. 137. In response, white leaders reformed the Democratic party with the in tent of \"redeeming\" the State and re-establishing white supremacy. This was accomplished by using violence to deter Black people from political participation and, once the Redeemers returned to political office, to pass racially discrimina- tory laws to cement their control. 138. In 1874, Democratic candidates were elected to public office in large numbers. On election day, in Eufaula, Alabama, members of a white paramil- itary group known as the White League, killed several unarmed Black Republican voters and turned away thousands of voters from the polls. 139. The following year, in 1875, the Alabama legislature adopted a new state constitution and passed a series of local la ws and ordinances designed to strip Black Americans of the civil rights they en-joyed briefly during Reconstruction. 140. At the 1901 Constitutional Convention, 155 white male delegates gathered in Montgomery with the express intention \"to establish white supremacy in the State.\" 141. The Convention ratified changes to the con- stitution that required literacy tests as a prerequisite to register to vote and mandated payment of an annual $1.50 poll tax, which was intend ed to and had the effect JA171 of disenfranchising Black voters. United States v. Ala- bama , 252 F. Supp. 95, 99 (M.D. Ala. 1966). 142. After the United States Supreme Court in- validated white-only primaries in 1944, Alabama passed the \"Boswell Amendment\" to its Constitution in 1946, adding an \"understanding requirement\" meant to give registrars broad discretion to deny African Americans the ability to register to vote. 143. After a federal court invalidated the Bos- well Amendment in 1949, Alabama replaced its under- standing requirement with a literacy test, again with the purpose of preventing African Americans from reg- istering to vote. 144. After the Supreme Court outlawed the white primary in 1944, many Alabama counties shifted to at-large elections, the intent of which was to prevent African Americans from electi ng their candidates of choice. 145. In 1951, Alabama enacted a law prohibiting single-shot voting in municipal elections, the intent of which was to prevent African Americans from electing their candidates of choice. 146. In 1957, Alabama transformed the bounda- ries of the city of Tuskeg ee into a twenty-eight-sided figure designed to fence ou t African Americans from the city limits and ensure that only white residents could elect city officials. Gomillion v. Lightfoot , 364 U.S. 339 (1960). JA172 147. In 1964 and 1965, Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark, Alabama state troop ers, and vigilantes vio- lently assaulted peaceful Black protesters attempting to gain access to the franchise. 148. On March 7, 1965, in what became known as Bloody Sunday, state troopers viciously attacked and brutally beat unarmed peaceful civil rights activ- ists crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, where less than 5 percent of Black voters were regis-tered to vote. Bloody Sunday helped pave the way for the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 and Ala- bama was declared a \"covered\" state under Section 4(b) of the Act. 149. Between 1965 and 2013, at least 100 voting changes proposed by Alabama state, county or city of- ficials were either blocked or altered pursuant to Sec- tion 5 of the Voting Rights Act. No objection was raised after 2008. The objections include at least 16 objections between 1969 and 2008 in cases where a proposed state or local redistricting plan had the purpose or would have the effect of diminishing the ability of Black voters to elect their cand idates of choice. The last sustained objection to an Alabama state law occurred in 1994. 150. In 1986, a court found that the state laws requiring numbered posts for nearly every at-large voting system in Alabama had been intentionally en- acted to dilute Black voting strength, and that num-bered posts had the effect of diluting Black voting strength in at-large elections. Dillard v. Crenshaw Cty. , JA173 640 F. Supp. 1347, 1357 (1986). The court also found that from the late 1800s to the 1980s, Alabama had purposefully manipulated the method of electing local governments as needed to prevent Black citizens from electing their preferred candidates. Id. 151. Ultimately, a defendant class of 17 county commissions, 28 county school boards, and 144 munic- ipalities were found to be employing at-large election systems designed and motivated by racial discrimina-tion. These cases resulted in settlement agreements with about 180 Alabama jurisdictions that were re- quired to adopt new election systems including single-member districts, limited voting, and cumulative vot- ing systems, in an attempt to purge the state's election systems of intentional discrimination. 152. Between 1965 and 2021, subdivisions in Al- abama continued to use at-large elections with num-bered posts. 153. Federal courts recently ruled against or al- tered local at-large voting systems with numbered post created by the State Legislature to address their al- leged racially discriminatory purpose or effect. See, e.g., Jones , 2019 WL 7500528, at *4; Ala. State Conf. of the NAACP v. City of Pleasant Grove , No. 2:18-cv-02056, 2019 WL 5172371, at *1 (N.D. Ala. Oct. 11, 2019). 154. Black voters have challenged other Ala- bama voting laws under the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution in federal court. See, e.g., People First of Alabama v. Merrill , 491 F. Supp. 3d 1076, 1106-1107 695 F. Supp. 517, JA174 530 (M.D. Ala. 1988). For example, the Supreme Court struck down Alabama's discriminatory misdemeanant disfranchisement law, Hunter v. Underwood , 471 U.S. 222 (1985), and a state law permitting certain discrim-inatory annexations, Pleasant Grove v. United States , 479 U.S. 462, 466-67 (1987). 155. In 2020, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama held as follows in a case where plaintiffs argued that Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act requires Alabama to elect state appellate judges by districts: Alabama today is a vastly different place than it was even a half-century ago. Overt discrim- inatory election devices have long been elimi-nated. Voter registration and turnout rates among African-Americans and whites have reached parity. . . . In 2017, Doug Jones be-came the first Democrat to win a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama in a quarter century, in an election in which African-American votes were decisive. Plaintiffs simply have not shown that, in present-day Alabama, there are any barriers keeping African Americans from participating in th e political process as voters. The level of black participation in the electoral process is not depressed. 156. Alabama State Conf. of Nat'l Ass'n for Ad- vancement of Colored No. 2:16-CV- 731-WKW, 2020 WL 583803, at *41 (M.D. Ala. Feb. 5, 2020) (citations omitted). JA175 157. Since the Shelby County v. Holder decision in 2013, federal courts have ordered more than one po- litical subdivision in Alabama to be re-subjected to pre- clearance review under Secti on 3(c) of the Voting Rights Act. See Jones , 2019 WL 7500528, at *4-5; Allen v. City of , No. 13-0107, 2014 WL 12607819, at *2 (S.D. Ala. Jan. 13, 2014). 158. Individuals with lower household incomes are less likely to vote. 159. Alabama's policy of denying Black people equal access to education persisted after the Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education . In 1956, after a federal court ordered the segregated Uni- versity of Alabama to admit a Black woman named Au-therine Lucy, white people gathered on campus, burned a cross, and marched through town chanting, \"Hey, hey, ho, ho, Autherine has got to go!\" 160. In 2018, in a case challenging the attempt by the City of Gardendale, wh ich is 85% white, to form a school district separate from Jefferson County's more racially diverse district, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a finding that \"race was a motivating factor\" in the city's effort. Stout v. Jefferson Cnty. Bd. of Ed. , 882 F.3d 988, 1007-1009 2018). 161. Alabama's constitution still contains lan- guage that mandates separa te schools for Black and white students after a majority of voters rejected re-peal attempts in 2004 and 2012, although the provi- sion has not been enforceable for decades. JA176 162. Alabama was the first st ate ever to be sub- jected to a statewide injunction prohibiting the state from failing to disestablish its racially dual school sys- tem. Lee v. Macon Cty. Bd. of Ed. , 267 F. Supp. 458 (M.D. Ala.), aff 'd 389 U.S. 215 (1967). The order re- sulted from the court's findin g that the State Board of Education, through Governor George Wallace, had pre-viously wielded its powers to maintain segregation across the state. Id. 163. A trial court found that for decades, state of- ficials ignored their duties under the statewide deseg- regation order. See Lee v. Lee , 963 F. Supp. 1122, 1128-30 (M.D. Ala. 1997). A court also found that the state did no t satisfy its obligations to remedy the vestiges of segregation under this order until as late as 2007. Lee v. Lee County Bd. of Educ. , 476 F. Supp. 2d 1356 (M.D. Ala. 2007). 164. In 1991, a trial court in Knight v. Alabama , 787 F. Supp. 1030 (N.D. Ala. 1991), found that Alabama had failed to eliminate the lingering and continued ef-fects of segregation and discrimination in the Univer- sity of Alabama and Auburn University, and at the state's public Historically Black Colleges and Univer-sities (HBCUs). 165. In 1995, the trial court issued a remedial de- cree analogous to the statewide injunction issued in Lee v. Macon , and the court oversaw implementation of that order for over a decade. Knight v. State of Ala. , 900 F. Supp. 272 (N.D. Ala. 1995). Alabama did not satisfy JA177 its obligations under that order until 2006. Knight v. Alabama , 469 F. Supp. 2d 1016 (N.D. Ala. 2006). 166. Alabama has never had more than one Afri- can-American congressional representative, and no Af- rican American has been elected to the U.S. House of Representatives outside of CD 7. 167. There are currently no African-American statewide officials in Alabama. 168. Only two African Americans have been elected to statewide office in Alabama, and both ran as incumbents after first being appointed. No Black per- son has won statewide office in Alabama since 1996. 169. The overwhelming majority of African- American representatives in the Alabama Legislature come from majority-minority districts. 170. None of the current statewide elected offi- cials are Black. Only two Bl ack people have ever been elected to statewide office. In both instances, the office was associate justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. In 1982 and 1988, the late Justice Oscar W. Adams, Jr. was elected to two consecut ive terms; and, in 1994, Jus- tice Ralph D. Cook won an unopposed statewide elec- tion. In 2000, both Justice Cook and the then-recently appointed Justice John England, both Black Demo- crats, lost elections to white Republican candidates. 171. Kenneth Paschal is a Black Republican who currently represents District 73 in the Alabama House of Representatives. District 73 includes Shelby County. JA178 There are currently no Black Republicans in the state Senate or in any statewide elective positions. 172. In 2014, following the Supreme Court's de- cision in Shelby County v. Holder , Alabama's photo identification law went into effect. 173. The United States Bureau of the Census re- leases data to the states af ter each census for use in redistricting. This data includes population and demo-graphic information for each census block. 174. Following the 2020 Census, the Census Bu- reau was statutorily required to release this redistrict- ing data no later than April 1, 2021. 13 U.S.C. \u00a7 141. However, in February 2021, the Census Bureau issued a press release stating that it would not release the re- districting data until September 30, 2021. On March 10, 2021, the State of Alabam a sued the Census Bu- reau to require it to comply with the statutory dead- line. See Alabama v. United States Dep't of Com. , No. 3:21-CV-211-RAH-ECM-KCN, (M.D. Ala.) (three judge-court). On March 15, 2021, the Census Bureau issued a further press release stating it could provide redis- tricting data in a legacy format by mid-to-late August 2021. The Census Bureau provided initial redistricting data to Alabama on August 12, 2021. 175. On May 5, 2021, the Reapportionment Com- mittee of the Alabama Legislature passed the Redis- tricting Guidelines to be used by the Committee during the redistricting process. Those Guidelines passed on a 16-1 vote, with both Republicans and Democrats as JA179 well as Black and White legislators supporting the Guidelines. 176. The Reapportionment Committee held 28 public hearings at location s around the state between September 1 and September 16. The public could at- tend these hearings in person or via videoconference. 177. On October 25, 2021, Alabama Governor Kay Ivey officially called for the Legislature to convene in a special session to address redistricting. 178. On October 26, 2021, the Reapportionment Committee met and considered a draft congressional plan. 179. On October 28, 2021, the special session be- gan and the Congressional Plan (then H.B. 1) was as- signed to the House Committee on State Government. On October 29, the Congressional Plan (in addition to three other redistricting pl ans) was voted out of com- mittee. All Black Representatives on the Committee voted against the map. 180. On November 1, the House of Representa- tives considered the Congressional Plan. The same day, the House passed the Congressional Plan 6538; in ad- dition to every Democratic Representative, several Re-publicans voted against the plan. One Black Representative, Rep. Keith Paschal who is the sole Black Republican legislator, voted in favor of the Con-gressional Plan. 181. On November 2, the Senate General Fund and Appropriations Committee considered the JA180 Congressional Plan. The Plan was voted out of Com- mittee that same day. All Black Senators on the Com- mittee voted against the map. 182. On November 3, the full Senate approved the Congressional Plan 22-7 and forwarded the Plan to Alabama Governor Kay Ivey. All six Black Senators present and Billy Beasley, the sole White Democratic Senator, voted against the map. On November 4, Gov- ernor Ivey signed the Congressional Plan into law. 183. Alabama's primary elections\u2014including elections for U.S. Congress\u2014are scheduled for May 24, 2022. Candidates seeking their party's nomination must file a declaration of candidacy with the state party chairman by January 28, 2022. See Ala. Code \u00a7 17-13-5(a). 184. On Tuesday, July 23, a special election was held to fill a vacancy in District 73 of the Alabama House of Representatives. The winner was Kenneth Paschal, the Republican cand idate, who received 2,743 votes. Representative Paschal is African American. His white Democratic opponent received 920 votes. District 73 is located in Shelby County, Alabama. Based on 2010 census data, the voting-age population of District 73 was 84.12% white and 9.75% black. Representative Paschal defeated a white Republican candidate in the primary election by 64 votes. Representative Paschal received 1,476 votes, while his white opponent received 1,412 votes.

MERRILL Case No.: 2:21-cv-012921 DECLARATION OF JOSEPH BAGLEY PHD (Filed Dec. 14, 2021) I. CREDENTIALS, PURPOSE I am an Assistant Professor of History at Perime- ter College, Georgia State University. My specific area of study is United States constitutional and legal his-tory, politics, and race relations, with a focus on Ala- bama and Georgia. I earn ed a Ph.D. in 2013 from Georgia State and an M.A. ( 2007) and B.A. (2004) from Auburn University. My first book, The Politics of White Rights: Race, Justice, and Integrating Alabama's Schools , was published in November 2018 by the Uni- versity of Georgia Press in the Politics and Culture of the Twentieth Century South series. There, I assert that Alabama lawmakers used lessons from the fight against school desegregation to perfect the process of \"colormasking\" legislation, or in creating racially dis- criminatory laws - such as those that maintain the po-litical and electoral status quo when it comes to Black voting and political representation - that can with- stand legal tests. My current projects include a book manuscript examining the struggle for voting rights in Alabama and a grant proposal for a National Endow- ment for the Humanities \"P ublic Humanities Discus- sions\" series focused on citizenship rights and obligations in Georgia. I have been certified as an expert by this Court in previous voting rights litigation. I submitted a report, JA186 testified in a deposition and at trial, and was cited in the Court's opinion in People First of Alabama v. Mer- rill in 2020.1 My academic work has been cited in the Case Western Law Review , the Journal of Urban His- tory, Rural Sociology , the Alabama Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Law Review , and in the New York Times Magazine (NYTM ). My doctoral thesis, \"School Deseg- regation, Law and Order, and Litigating Social Justice in Alabama,\" which formed th e basis of my book man- uscript, was quoted multiple times by Pulitzer Prize winner Nikole Hannah-Jones in her September 6, 2017 piece in \"Resegregation in Jefferson County,\" Hannah-Jones examin es the city of Garden- dale's attempt to secede from the county school system - an issue litigated in the Stout v. Jefferson County Board of Education school desegregation case that re- mains before this Court. 2 1 People First of Alabama v.

JA187 I include here a C.V. listing conference presenta- tions, invited talks, essays, and solicited book and man- uscript reviews that I have written for the University Press of Kansas, the Alabama Review , and journals such as Urban History and History of Education Quar- terly. I am compensated at the rate of $150 per hour for my work in preparing this report. This compensa-tion is not dependent upon my findings, and my opin- ions stated in this report do not necessarily represent the sum total of my opinions in this matter, which are subject to change upon further research or revelations. I have been asked by plaintiffs' counsel in this case to examine any relevant historical and contemporary evidence and to determine if, in my opinion, Alabama House Bill 1 (\"H.B. 1\"), es tablishing the map redrawing the state's congressional di stricts following the release of the 2020 Census data, will result in an impairment of Black voters' ability to pa rticipate fully and equita- bly in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice. My analysis adheres to the common standards of historiography , meaning that I have ob- jectively examined different types of sources - the leg- islative and judicial record, newspaper coverage, campaign literature, and public statements, for exam-ple, along with the existing scholarship and the estab- lished historical background - and weighed all of that material collectively in forming my opinions. In my evaluation of this evidence and in my effort to deter- mine whether, in my opin ion, H.B. 1 will deny Black citizens of Alabama an equitable right to elect candi-dates of their choice, I am also guided by the \"totality JA188 of the circumstances\" test, as applied using the factors set forth by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee dur- ing the amendment of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in 1982 and subsequently referenced by the Su-preme Court in Thornburg v. Gingles (478 U.S. 30, 1986, \" Gingles I \") (the \"Senate Factors\"). 3 There are seven core Senate Factors and two typical \"additional\" factors that might be consider ed to the extent that they are appropriate. These include: The \"extent of any hist ory of official discrimi- nation in the state or political subdivision that touched the right of the members of the minority group to register, to vote, or other-wise to participate in the democratic process\" [Factor 1] The \"extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political s ubdivision is racially polarized\" [Factor 2] 3 In 1980, the Supreme Court held in City of Mobile v. Bolden (446 U.S. 55) that discriminatory results alone did not warrant relief in voting rights litigation and that plaintiffs needed to es-tablish discriminatory intent, prompting Congress to amend Sec-tion 2. The committee derived the relevant factors from pre-Bolden jurisprudence, especially Whitcomb v. Chavis (403 U.S. 124, 1971), White v. Regester (412 U.S. 755, 1973) and Zimmer v. McKeithen (485 F.2d 1297, 5th CCA, 1973). Report of the Com-mittee on the Judiciary on S. 1992 (Voting Rights Act Extension), United States Senate, 97th Congress, 2nd Session, Report No. 97-417 [Senate Factors Report], p. 28, n. 113; Peyton McCrary, \"His- tory in the Courts: The Significance of City of Mobile v. Bolden,\" in Chandler Davidson (Ed.), Minority Vote Dilution (Washington, D.C.: Howard University Press, 1984), pp. 47-65. JA189 The \"extent to which the state or political sub- division has used unusually large election dis- tricts, majority vote requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group\" [Factor 3] If \"there is a candidate slating process, whether the members of the minority group have been denied access to that group\" [Factor 4] The \"extent to which members of the minority group in the state or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education, employment and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process\" [Factor 5] Whether \"political campaigns have been or subtle racial appeals\" [Factor 6] The \"extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction\" [Factor 7] Whether \"there is a significant lack of respon- siveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group\" [Factor 8, Additional Factor] And \"Whether the policy underlying the state or political subdivision's use of such voting qualification, prerequisite to voting, or stand- ard, practice or procedure is tenuous\" [Factor 9, Additional Factor]. JA190 These factors allow scholars and courts to undertake a \"practical evaluation of the pa st and present realities\" and to determine \"whether the political process is equally open to minority voters\" ( Gingles I at 478). As the Court stated in Gingles , other additional factors may be considered, and ther e is no requirement that all factors be considered or that any particular weight be assigned to any one factor.4 Given the nature of this case and my own exper- tise, my report focuses on Factors 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8. I will not systematically address here Factors 2, 3, or 4. While Factor 2 carries great weight in voting rights lit-igation, racially polarized voting (\"RPV\") analysis is generally the purview of specially trained political sci- entists. Plaintiffs may or may not employ such scholars to conduct RPV analysis, but I do not draw any conclu- sions based on RPV except to acknowledge that federal courts have repeatedly determined that voting in Ala-bama, including in congressio nal contests, has been ra- cially polarized. 5 I discuss the kind of enhancing devices and schemes covered in Factor 3 in my treat-ment of Factor 1, and I contend that the discriminatory 4 Senate Factors Report, pp. 28-9. 5 Greater Birmingham Ministries v.

JA191 redistricting plans discussed therein are as much ex- emplary of the devices highlighted by this factor as the at-large election schemes and numbered place laws of the (somewhat) more distant past. My summary findings as to the relevant Senate Factors with respect to th is report are as follows: Factor 1: the state of Alabama has an undisputed history of discrimination against Black citizens, espe- cially when it comes to registering to vote, voting, and enjoying an equitable chance to participate in the po- litical process, and this has been recognized by numer-ous courts. In particular, white legislators of both major political parties have, in the last 50 years, ma- nipulated the redistricting process to prevent Black citizens from electing members of Congress or, in the last 30 years, to limit Black voters' ability to elect members of Congress from more than one district. Factor 5: the effects of past and ongoing discrimi- nation in education, employment, health, and criminal justice are profound and have had a significant impact on Black voters' ability to participate fully in the polit- ical process. Factor 6: despite a decades-long tradition of color- masking racial appeals, campaigns and politicians' public statements have recently trended back towards more overt racial appeals, and these have been plenti- ful in Alabama and attributable to its current mem-bers of Congress and cand idates for those offices. JA192 Factor 7: the ability of Black Alabamians to elect candidates from among their own to statewide offices has been almost nonexistent, while Black candidates have had some success at the local level, thanks to lit-igation and federal government intervention. Factor 8 (Additional Factor 1): white lawmakers have been generally unresponsive to the needs and de- mands of Black citizens, as suggested by the fight for Medicaid expansion, by the actions of the state legisla-ture since Shelby County v. Holder , and by lawmakers' failure to address much of what I discuss under Factor 5. The Court should also consider the votes of the mem-bers of the state's congre ssional delegation on other bills that the Black community in the state would tend to support, especially a redistricting plan that would provide for a second majority-minority congressional district. Given these conclusions, in my opinion H.B. 1 will deny Black Alabamians an equitable right to elect can- didates of their choice. II. FACTOR 1: HISTORY OF DISCRIMINATION As this Court found in 2020, \"Black Alabamians have consistently overcome barriers to exercising their fundamental right to vote, only to later have that right curtailed,\" and the state's history of official discrimina-tion is replete with facts that the Court described as \"largely undisputed\" ( People First of Alabama v. Mer- rill, 467 F.Supp.3d 1179, \u00b6 32, ND). Similarly, the court in Alabama NAACP v. Alabama , also in 2020, found JA193 that, \"Alabama's history of discrimination against Af- rican Americans in all areas of life is long, well-docu- mented, and undisputed\" (CA 2:16-cv-00731-WKW- SMD, Feb. 5, 2020, MD, pp. 153-54). I will briefly sum-marize the history that is the basis for these findings for the Court, beginning with Reconstruction. As refer- enced, as recently as last year, federal courts in Ala-bama have ruled in favor of plaintiffs targeting vote dilution schemes that persist, having fallen through the cracks of administrative and judicial oversight. 6 I conclude by examining the efforts of white Dem- ocrats and white Republicans in the state legislature, during the last 30 years, to manipulate the redistrict- ing process to the detriment of Black voters. Of pri- mary importance in this case, I trace the general characteristics of the state' s 7th Congressional District from the redistricting litigat ion of the 1990s to the pre- sent. a. From Reconstruction to the Constitution of 1901 Alabama's effort to restrict the rights of its Black citizens began when the enslaved became citizens. A pattern of advancement and backlash was thus estab- lished at the very beginning of the story of Black citi-zenship. After the Civil War, Alabama was among the first former Confederate states to enact \"Black Codes\" 6 Jones v. Jefferson County, No. 2:19-cv-01821-MHH (ND, 2019); Alabama State Conf. of the NAACP v. City of Pleasant Grove, No. 2:18-cv-02056 (ND, 2019). JA194 limiting the citizenship rights of former slaves.7 The 14th Amendment invalidated such laws on equal pro- tection grounds, and the 15th Amendment guaranteed formerly enslaved men the right to vote. While the Un-ion Army was empowered to combat the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups, Alabama was forced to accede to some measure of Black voting and to the election of a few Black candidates to office though, even then, most offices were won by white Re- publicans. When the Union Army was removed from the state and priorities in Washington began to shift, white Democrats unleashed a campaign of violence aimed at \"redemption,\" or gaining back control of the state government. At the heart of that effort was the disenfranchisement of Black citizens. The party adopted the slogan \"White Supremacy for the Right\" (a slogan it did not abandon unt il 1966) and replaced the state's Congressional Reconstruction constitution with one that protected white people in majority-Black ar-eas by severely restricting home rule and giving 7 Alabama's Black Code was enacted on January 15, 1866. It subjected anyone convicted of va grancy, including \"stubborn serv- ant[s],\" runaway apprentices, and habitually ne-glect[ed] his employment,\" to a $50 fine which, if unpaid, would compel convicted to work for his employer, usually the former master, for free until it was paid off.

JA195 control over local governments to the governor and the state legislature.8 The \"redeemer\" Democrats used a variety of measures to consolidate that control: where white peo- ple constituted a local majority, legislators switched from district to at-large elections; where they did not, legislators eliminated elections in favor of gubernato- rial appointment; they set higher bonds for office-hold- ing, abolished courts, closed polling places, and eventually resorted to outright election fraud in the form of ballot-box stuffing. The legislature ultimately passed the Sayre Law, establishing what District Judge Myron Thompson would later describe as \"a more respectable and cunning way of controlling or disenfranchising black voters\" ( Harris v. Siegelman , 695 F. Supp. 517, 522, MD, 1988). The Sayre Law re- placed the \"party ballot\" with the \"secret ballot,\" which came with written instructions that could only be ex-plained by a gubernatorially appointed poll official. Not only did this allow those officials to swindle Black voters, it discouraged many Black people from even bothering to go to the polls; the Sayre Law resulted in an immediate 22 percent drop in Black turnout. 9 8 Rogers and Ward, \"From 1865 labama,\" in Chandler Davidson et al., Eds, Quiet Revolution in the South: The Impact of the Voting Rights Act, 1965-1990 (Princeton: Princeton University of Alabama , Nov. 6, 2009; Burton, , 133-35; McCrary, al, \"Alabama,\" p. 42-43; Rodgers and Ward, \"From JA196 Emboldened by federal indifference, in 1901 Dem- ocrats held a constitutional convention for the ex- pressed purpose of \"avoid[ing] Negro domination\" and \"establish[ing] white supremacy.\" The delegates' was to \"disfranchise every Negro in the state.\" The constitution they adopted, which is still op- erative, featured provisions for an accumulating poll tax; property ownership and employment require- ments for registering to vote; disenfranchisement of anyone convicted of vagrancy or \"crimes of moral tur-pitude,\" a deliberately chosen class of crimes for which Black people were more frequently convicted; and a lit- eracy test to be administered by local (white) regis-trars, which is to say, one that could be discriminatorily administered and used to bar Blacks, but not poor whites, from registering to vote. 10 1865 through 1920,\" The Pivotal Case of Dillard v.

The constitution was upheld by the Supreme Court in Giles v. Harris (189 U.S. 475, 1903). The following year, the Alabama Democratic Party adopted the \"white primary,\" whereby member-ship was limited, as in a club, to white people, thus bar- ring Black people from participating in what had become the only election that mattered. White suprem-acy was the order of the day in Alabama from that point until the Second World War. The constitution also institutionalized what had already been written into the state's penal code and had escaped Radical Republican censure - the new document included an anti- miscegenation clause that read, \"The legislature shall never pass any law to au- thorize or legalize any marriage between any white person and a negro, or desc endant of a negro.\" A \"Ne- gro\" was anyone with \"one drop\" of Black \"blood.\" The anti-miscegenation statute was revised in 1940 to read, \"If any white person and any negro, or the de- scendant of any negro intermarry, or live in adultery or fornication with each other, each of them shall, on con-viction, be imprisoned in the penitentiary for not less than two nor more than seven years.\" Such laws were United States v.

From World War II to the Civil Rights Move- ment The \"white primary\" wa s overturned when the Supreme Court handed down Smith v. Allwright in 1944 (321 U.S. 649). True to the pattern of advance- and-restrict, however, Alabama's white Democratic lawmakers responded by enacting the Boswell Amend- ment to the 1901 constitution - a facially race-neutral provision that required applicants for voter registra- tion to \"understand and explain\" an article of the U.S. Constitution. One of the bill's framers admitted that this would enable boards of registrars to \"prevent from registering those elements in our community which have not yet fitted themselves for self-government,\" meaning Black people. 12 Birmingham's Arthur Shores 11 Loving v.

Schnell , 81 F. Supp. 872, 880, SD, quoting Yick Wo v. Hopkins , 118 U.S. 356, 366, 1886). The state legislature responded by presenting the almost exclusively white electorate with a Voter Qual- ification Amendment, which it ratified in 1951. The amendment replaced the \"understand and explain\" language with a deliberately byzantine application process devised by the state Supreme Court. Prospec-tive voters had to navigate a lengthy questionnaire (21 questions),, perform a reading of the U.S. Constitution at the direction of a white registrar, and present a \"sup-porting witness,\" an existing voter who would testify to the applicant's residence and good standing, as well as the witness's own occupation and employer. 13 \"Mobile and the Boswell Amendment,\" Alabama Review , 65 (July 2012), pp. 205-19; Donald S.

When Black citizens began agitating for citizenship rights during and after World War II, many local governments, via state legislative delega-tions, switched to at-large electoral systems, as some had done during the \"redemption,\" to avoid the election of Black officials in distri cts or wards that were pre- dominantly Black. Black voters, though, realized that they could increase the numer ical value of their vote by throwing all of their support behind one candidate. The anti-single-shot law, the brainchild of Sam Engel- hardt, a pioneer of the white supremacist Citizens' Council in the state and the author of the infamous Tuskegee gerrymander, invalidated any ballot in an at- large election that did not include a full slate of choices. That law and the new voter registration questionnaire, along with tactics like simply closing a registration of- fice when Black people came to register, served to limit Black access to the franchise at a time when the state's handful of Black attorneys, in cluding Shores, had little help in assailing the legislative wall that the state had built over the preceding half century. 14 In 1957, Congress passed the first Civil Rights Act since Reconstruction, with no southern support.

Wil- son, 123 F. Supp. 917 (MD, 1954). JA201 years later, it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1960. These acts created the Civil Rights Division (\"CRD\") within the Justice Department, tasked it with enforc- ing the 15th Amendment in the South, gave it the tools to bring suit on behalf of the United States against states that were discriminating in voter registration, and empowered it to seek the appointment of federal voting referees. The division subsequently sued the state of Alabama and registrars in numerous counties in the Alabama Black Belt - the old, black-soiled plan-tation belt where Black m ajorities threatened white supremacy in the most critical way. The CRD targeted the discriminatory use of the state's voter registration questionnaire. 15 In one of the CRD's Blac k Belt suits, Judge Frank Johnson determined that \"A s to Negro applicants, the defendants used the [voter registration] question- naire to obtain substantive information regarding the applicants' qualifications for registering and also as a tricky examination or test. If a Negro applicant failed to meet the standard require d of him, he was denied registration regardless of whether the error or omis- sion on the form was formal, technical, or inconsequen- tial.\" Judge Johnson explained, \"For white applicants, the questionnaire was not used as an examination or 15 Landsberg, Free at Last to Vote , pp. 7, 26-27; 17 Southern Cali- fornia Review of Law and Social Justice 2, pp. 249- 281, Supp. 193, 198, 1962).16 Not all of the CRD Black Belt suits were filed Johnson's Middle District. Wilcox County lies in the Southern District, where sat Judge Daniel Thomas, known to delay and frustrate civil rights actions on his docket.17 The CRD alleged that in Wilcox, from Janu- ary 1, 1959, through October 17, 1963, 29 Black resi- dents tried to register and were denied, whereas 376/386 white applicants were able to register in the same period. Despite the fa ct that 70 percent of the county's voting age population was Black, zero Black people were registered to vote at the time the suit was filed. Judge Thomas declined to enjoin the county offi- cials but was reversed by the 5th Circuit, which found that there was \"substantial uncontradicted evidence in the record that the regi stration officials applied the supporting witness requirement in a discrimina-tory fashion\" ( United States v. Logue , 344 F.2d 290, 291-92, 1965). By the time of that decision, various 16 The form used needlessly verbose language; for example, it prompted prospective voters to answer the \"interrogatories pro-pounded\" by the board. It asked applicants to read selected por-tions of the Constitution in front of the registrars. Applicants had to produce a supporting witness in person who would vouch for their residency and good characte r. And the form eventually in- cluded an \"Insert\" section that al lowed for rotating civics ques- tions, so that voting rights organizations could not coach applicants on the answers.

JA203 aspects of the questionnaire had been enjoined, from Wilcox to Montgomery and from Sumter to Macon and Bullock.18 Beyond the questionnaire, local officials engaged in various other tactics to frustrate Black citizens from voting. Defendants in the Montgomery CRD case at-tempted to distort registration numbers by race by denying a few applications from white would-be voters; the court found this to be \"nothing more than a sham and an attempt on the part of the [Montgomery] Board [of Registrars] to disguise their past discriminatory practices.\" Judge Johnson observed that this \"ap-proached the ridiculous when the Board rejected the law partner of one of the defense attorneys, a retired general and graduate of West Point, and the college graduate son of one of the State's attorneys general\" (Penton , at 198). Officials in Elmore County denied ap- plications from Black people on minor technical grounds, while not doing the same for white people; rendered assistance to wh ite applicants and not to Black applicants; failed to notify Black applicants of the need to sign an oath, then disqualified them for not signing; failed to notify Black applicants when their registration was denied; and required that Black 18 United States v.

JA204 applicants wait three months before attempting again to register.19 Lawmakers then replaced the anti-single-shot law with a numbered post law in conjunction with a major- ity vote requirement and staggered terms. Judge My- ron Thompson would later describe how the numbered place law \"intentional[ly] . . . reshaped for discrimination\" and became the \"the discriminatory centerpiece\" of a vote dilution scheme ( Crenshaw County , 640 F. Supp, 1347, 1357, MD, 1986). Candidates had to run for specific, enumerated posts or places on a given body, be it a school board or county commission or city coun- cil. And with terms staggered, each contest would be head-to-head and at-large, which is to say county or city-wide. White majorities in registered voters could then use the majority vote requirement to win, poten- tially, each and every seat, each and every time. 20 Democratic Party leader Frank Mizell laid bare the intent behind this arr angement in a meeting of the State Democratic Executive Committee, a transcript of which was later discovered by a historian working in the Dillard v. Crenshaw case. \"If you have people who want to vote as a bloc,\" Mizell explained, using a eu- phemism for the Black vote, \"it would be very easy un- der the single shot voting for all of them to come in, to put a scallowag or a Negro in there.\" There was, he said, a \"situation in Alabama that we are becoming 19 United States v. Cartwright, 230 F. Supp. 873 (MD, 1964). 20 McCrary et al., \"Alabama,\" p. 46. JA205 more painfully aware of every passing day,\" as there was now \"a concerted desire and a campaign to register Negroes en masse, regardless of the fact that many of them ordinarily cannot qualify because of their crimi-nal records, or criminal attitudes, because of the fact that they are illiterate and cannot understand or pass literacy tests.\" According to Mizell, it had \"occurred to a great many people, including the legislature of Ala- bama, that to protect the white people of Alabama, that there should be numbered place laws.\" 21 c. Reapportionment, Redistricting, and the Voting Rights Act Another tool used to deny Black citizens equitable access to the franchise has been the racial gerryman- der. In 1960 Alabama state Senator Sam Engelhardt orchestrated the state's first modern attempt to use the racial gerrymander to disenfranchise Black citi- zens. Engelhardt was a large landowner from Macon County who lamented the possibility of Black electoral success by asking rhetorically, \"If you had a nigger tax assessor, what would he do to you?\" He purported to enter politics for the sole pu rpose of keeping Black ten- ant farmers from \"stealing his property.\" 22 Engelhardt 21 Quoted in Dillard v. Crenshaw County, 640 F. Supp, 1347, 1357, MD, 1986. 22 Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U. S. 339 (1960); Engelhardt also argued that \"Desegregating the schools will lead to rape!\" He added, \"Damn niggers stink. They 're unwashed. They have no morals; they're just animals. The nigger is depraved! Give him the opportunity to be near a white woman, and he goes berserk!\" The conclusion: \"The nigger isn't just a dark-skinned white man. JA206 sponsored a bill that passed the state legislature that redrew the boundaries of the city of Tuskegee, home to the prestigious Tuskegee Institute and a seedbed of Black activism, to exclude nearly every single Black voter, and no white voters, from the city limits. Black plaintiffs brought suit and lost at trial, but the decision was reversed by the Fifth Circuit and the Supreme Court, which found that the gerrymander served no le- gitimate purpose beyond its being \"used as an instru- ment for circumventing a federally protected right\" (Gomillion v. Lightfoot , 364 U.S. 339, 347, 1960). The 1960 Census was the first in American history in which respondents could select their own race; it had been determined by census-takers prior to that time. When the 1960 data was published, Alabama was revealed to have lost a seat in its Congressional dele- gation. The state faced the necessity of redistricting for the U.S. House under the shadow of Gomillion . And yet the state legislature failed to pass a such a plan. Nor did the state pass any plan to redraw its state legisla- tive districts. Indeed, despite a directive in the state constitution, Alabama had not once since 1901 reap- portioned its legislature to account for population growth and shifts. With the urbanization that had taken place since the constitution was adopted, and es- pecially since the end of World War II, this meant that white legislators from majority-Black rural areas, namely in the Black Belt, held a disproportionate share of seats in the stat e legislature. When the U.S. He's a separate individual altogether.\" Bagley, Politics of White Rights , pp. 19, 213 JA207 Supreme Court handed down Baker v. Carr in 1962, declaring reapportionment a justiciable issue, white Democrats from urban areas in Alabama filed Sims v. Frink . In the first of several rulings under the Sims mantle, a three-judge court decided to give the Ala- bama legislature a chance to rectify that situation on its own without further action on the court's part.23 The state submitted two state legislative plans that summer. Of these the court wrote, \"We find that each . . . when considered as a whole, is so obviously discriminatory, arbitrary, and irrational that it be- comes unnecessary to pursue a detailed development of each of the relevant facto rs of the [invidiousness] test\" ( Sims v.

This came amid a rising Republican chal-lenge. White Democrats in the South had begun, at a minimum, to support Republican candidates for Presi- dent and, increasingly, switch parties altogether as part of a backlash against the Kennedy administra- tion's actions - namely, sending federal troops to sup- port the desegregation of the University of Mississippi and other fledgling measures in support of a growing civil rights movement. They nonetheless carried all 8 seats in the Alabama congressional election that year. The odd man left out of the Democratic slate was vet-eran lawmaker Frank Boykin of Mobile, representing the old 1st District wherein there were a \"substantial number\" of voters of the \"so-called minority bloc,\" meaning Black voters. 25 When the Supreme Court decided the appeal in the Sims case in 1964, it handed down its landmark one-person/one-vote ruling, styled Reynolds v. Sims .

JA209 malapportioned state legislative scheme. A three-judge court the following year found the plan for the state Senate permissible but held that the plan for the state House contained numerous districts with wide popula-tion variances with no rational basis but \"preventing the election of a Negro House member\" ( Sims v. Bag- gett, 247 F.Supp. 96, 109, M D, 1965). The court afforded great weight to the historical context, writing, \"The House plan adopted by the all-white Alabama Legisla- ture was not conceived in a vacuum. If this court ig-nores the long history of racial discrimination in Alabama, it will prove that justice is both blind and deaf \" ( Sims v. Baggett , Id.). Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act into law that same year, accelerating white flight to the Re-publican Party at a time when Alabama's public schools were being desegreg ated by way of litigation for just the second school year. Also that year, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Wesberry v. Sanders , wherein it held Georgia's 5th Congre ssional District to be mal- apportioned, applying the principles in Baker and Reynolds to congressional redistricting. Alabama fi- nally passed a congressional redistricting plan in a special session that year. Some had pushed for main-taining the at-large election of the delegation, but with numbered posts; this was the impetus for the Mizell plea in the Executive Committee meeting - warning that voters could \"put a scallowag [Republican] or Negro in there\" - that became central to the Dillard litigation years later. White flight to the Republican Party had accelerated in response to the Johnson JA210 administration's actions, and Republicans took 5 of the 8 seats under the newly enacted district plan.26 The following year, 1965, in the aftermath of \"Bloody Sunday\" in Selma, the Voting Rights Act (\"VRA\") became law. At that time, 19 percent of Ala- bama's Black voting-age population was registered to vote, compared to 69 percent of the white voting-age population. That seemed destined to change with the VRA's prohibition on literacy tests, poll taxes, and other devices that would deny or abridge minority groups' access to the franchise. The CRD immediately sought a judgement striking down Alabama's poll tax, which Circuit Judge Richard Rives described as \"one of the last great pillars of racial discrimination\" ( United States v. State of Alabama , 252 F. Supp. 95, 96, MD, 1966). Section 5 of the VRA covered Alabama, meaning that, in order to make any changes to election law, in- cluding redistricting, the state needed to seek \"pre- clearance\" from the Attorn ey General (effectively the CRD and Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights). The Attorney General soon registered objections when Alabama localities tried to require voters to sign poll lists in order to access voting machines. And the CRD sought to block, by way of litigation, Alabama officials' efforts to \"freeze\" in office those \"who were elected when Negroes were being illegally deprived of the right to vote,\" while also \"freez[ing] Negroes out of the 26 Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533; Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U.S. 1. JA211 electorate\" ( Sellers v. Trussell , 253 F. Supp. 915, MD, 1966). Within a year of the VRA's passage, 107,000 Black voters registered in the state, pushing Black voter registration to nearly 60 percent by the end of the decade, even as white registration increased apace, reaching nearly 90 percent by the same time. Black leaders sought to capitalize and to organize. In 1968, Huntsville dentist John Cashin formed the National Democratic Party of Alabama (NDPA) which, that fall, ran several candidates in races across the Black Belt. But the names of the NDPA candidates were left off of the ballot or they were disqualified, ei-ther by way of new statutes designed for that purpose or by way of discriminatory use of existing statutes, both of which actions were subsequently enjoined by federal courts. NDPA candidates then won local elec- tions in four Black Belt counties, and Fred Gray and Thomas Reed of Tuskegee, running as Democrats, be-came the first Black member s of the state legislature since Reconstruction. Across the state, 23 Black candi- dates were elected to local bodies. 27 27 Hadnott v.

The court found the plans the state submitted to be \"unacceptable since, in conjunction with their discriminatory e ffect, they fall considerably short of guaranteeing to each citizen of Alabama that his vote 'is approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen in the State' \" ( Sims v. Amos , 336 F. Supp. 924, 936, MD, 1972). 28 The court ordered the implementation of the plaintiffs' plan, but it first gave the legislature another chance to produce a viable plan of its own. It submitted on e in the spring of 1973, but the court rejected that plan as well. The court noted that a legislative floor leade r for Governor George Wal- lace had instructed the reapportionment committee to take advantage of maximum-allowable deviations to change date, time of primaries to stifle use of conventions to nominate). 28 The CRD that year blocked two state laws that would have limited assistance to illiterate voters in municipal elections and another that would have increased the number of signatures necessary for candidates to qualif y to run as independents, in a plain effort to limit the ability of groups like NDPA to get candi-dates on the ballot.

When the court ordered the implementation of plaintiffs' plan, Wallace himself called it \"a most onerous and burdensome albatross around the necks of the people of Alabama.\" The fol-lowing fall, Black voters were able to elect 13 preferred candidates to the state legislature. 29 While 1973 marked the culmination of the Sims litigation, it marked only the beginning of redistricting battles. After the 1980 census, the legislature submit-ted its state House and Senate plan for preclearance, and the CRD concluded that if precleared and imple- mented, the plan would lead to \"a retrogression in the position of black voters\" through \"unnecessary recon- figuration\" in Jefferson County and in the Black Belt. 30 Black leaders in the state, meanwhile, filed suit seek-ing a preliminary injunction in advance of the Septem- ber primaries. The court allowed the legislature to attempt to pass a constitutional plan via special ses-sion, but the CRD found the plan it produced to be ob- jectionable due to the unnecessary cracking of Black communities in Jefferson County.

JA214 v. Hobbie ordered the implementation of modifications for Jefferson County submitted by plaintiffs on an in- terim basis for that fall.31 The Attorney General's Section 5 objection ren- dered the plan as set out by the legislature legally un- enforceable, so the court had not ruled on the merits of the plaintiffs' original claims. It had given the legisla- ture yet one more chance to enact a plan that could pass muster, under the specter of Senate hearings on amending Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to include the discriminatory results standard in response to the Supreme Court's decision in City of Mobile v. Bolden . In 1983 Act No. 83-154 passed the Alabama legis- lature and was precleared.

The Court soon thereafter handed down Gin- gles I , adopting the Senate Factors I use for guidance in this report. By that time, the CRD had sent federal observers to Alabama 107 times and had registered 59 objections to proposed changes in state or local election law. 33 That same year, 1986, Judge Thompson issued the court's ruling in Dillard (649 F Supp. 289, MD). The principle target of the lawsuit was the numbered place law, which in conjunction with at-large elections, stag- gered terms, and majority vote requirements, served to deny Black citizens across the state an equitable chance to elect candidates of their choice. Judge Thompson cited, among other evidence, the comments of Frank Mizell, who insi sted that numbered place laws were needed to \"protect the white people of Ala- bama,\" as proof of discriminatory intent. The Court recognized that at-large systems themselves were 32 Burton v.

JA216 relics of the redemption pe riod and that, in the 1950s and 1960s, these new elements like numbered post re- quirements were added to strengthen those systems and to deny victories to Bl ack candidates. Inspired by a statewide structural injunct ion that had been issued in the Lee v. Macon school desegregation litigation (dis- cussed infra ), plaintiffs in Dillard sought similar relief. Dillard would eventually compel 183 local govern- ments (17 county commission s, 28 county school boards, and 144 cities) to di scard at-large systems for single-member district plans, though some at-large electoral schemes have only recently been discarded by federal courts (see Jones v.

City of Pleasant Grove , No. 2:18-cv- 02056, ND, 2019).34 Throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, the CRD continued to register Section 5 objections to nu-merous proposed changes in state and local election law in Alabama. The types of changes that failed to re- ceive preclearance included a court-packing scheme, changes in candidate qual ification and nomination procedures, changes in vote r registration procedures, voter roll purges, changes in voter identification re- quirements, the addition of at-large seats on top of district schemes, racially motivated municipal 34 Anniston Star , Aug. 27, 1986; Selma Times-Journal , June 25, 1989; Consent Order, Taylor v.

The CRD had deter-mined that the legislators were cracking Black popu- lation centers due to \"a predisposition on the part of state political leadership to limit black voting potential to a single district,\" while hi ding behind the idea that the state was prioritizing a lack of retrogression by cre- ating the one majority-Black district and packing it with Black voters. Assistant Attorney General John R. Dunne wrote, \"The proposed plan provides for one such district based on black population concentrations in Jefferson County, Montgomery County and interven- ing areas. The remainder of the state's concentrated black population, however, is fragmented under the submitted plan among a number of districts none of which has a black population of as much as 30 per- cent.\" 37 A white realtor in Mobile brought suit against the plan under a one-person/o ne-vote claim, and Black voters joined the suit as plaintiff-intervenors with a Section 2 claim, citing spec ifically the lack of a sec- ond majority-Black congressional district.

After the 2000 Census, the first in which Ameri- cans could choose more than one race to identify themselves, the legislature, then still under white Democratic control, failed in regular and special ses- sions to pass a viable Congressional redistricting plan. 40 Three separate actions challenging the failure were filed and consolidated, and the state was forced to acknowledge that it was malapportioned. A three- judge court invited the submission of plans from all parties, heard expert witness testimony, and even ap-pointed two experts of its own, when the parties could not agree on any, to assist the court in what it admitted was extremely complex litig ation. While that trial was 40 The 2020 Census, for the first time, allows respondents to clarify their heritage by not just choosing white or black, but by adding information about their origin. This is important as the state of Alabama, and white society in general, have by law and custom long considered anyone wi th African heritage to be \"Ne- gro\" or Black. See, e.g., Ala.Const. Art. IV, \u00a7 102 (\"The legislature shall never pass any law to author ize or legalize any marriage between any white person and a negr o, or descendant of a negro.\") repealed by Amend. 667. Historically, and today, people with Af-rican ancestry self-identify and are categorized by society as \"Black,\" not white, despite the reality that, since slavery, most Black Americans are mixed race. JA221 ongoing, the legislature passed a plan for Congres- sional redistricting and subm itted it for preclearance. The court hearing the consolidated cases deferred to the Justice Department and the state and, rather than enter an injunction or rule on the merits of the state's plan, awaited a preclearance ruling, which came in March of 2002. The legislature passed redistricting plans for state house and senate districts and state board of education districts that were precleared along with the Congressional plan. Despite calls from Black legislators to create a second majority-Black congres- sional district, the plan adopted by the legislature maintained only one such district. 41 The Republican Party had begun siphoning local white Democrats and isolating Black elected officials and voters in the Democratic Party in the 1990s. White flight from the Democrats in presidential elections dated back at least to the Dixiecrats of 1948 if not the New Deal, but white voters remained loyal to the Dem- ocratic Party, in large part because George Wallace re- mained a dominant political force into the 1980s and never switched parties. Wallace retied in 1987, how- ever, and was succeeded by Republican Guy Hunt. George Bush carried the state against Bill Clinton in 1992. In 1996, the GOP swept statewide elections. U.S. Senator Richard Shelby switched parties in 1998. Be- tween the redistricting batt les of the early 2000s and the end of the decade, Republican leaders began 41 Douglas v.

White lawmakers had no need or incen- tive to bargain with Black Democrats. And if they could win at the ballot box, they would inherit, wholesale, the limited Congressional representation plan that pro- vided for only one majority-minority district. After the 2010 elections, most white politicians in Alabama were Republican, and very nearly every Black politician a Democrat. 43 42 Wayne Flynt, Alabama in the Twentieth Century (Tusca- loosa: University of Alabama Pr ess, 2004), pp. 102-4; Merle Black and Earl Black, The Rise of Southern Republicans (New York: Belknap Press of Harvard, 2002), pp. 314-15; Montgomery Adver- tiser, March 14, Nov. 6, 2008, Aug. 23, Oct. 8, Nov. 14, 2010; Anniston Star , Aug. 1, 2008; Alabama Journal , Nov. 5, 1962. 43 Montgomery Advertiser , Nov. 3, 2010, May 1, 2011; al.com and Mobile Press-Regist er Staff, \"Republicans claim majority in Alabama House and Senate for 1st time in 136 years,\" Al.com Nov. 3, 2010, https://www.al.c om/live/2010/11/republicans_ historic_alabama_majority.html; Camille reflects on GOP Crimson White , Oct. 23, 2012, https://cw.ua.edu/13191/news/hubbard-reflects-on-gop-takeover/.

Scott Beason, a white Republican and an-other lawmaker recorded on tape making racist re- marks, introduced an augmented version of the committee plan, with adjustments he had made to his own district. 49 When Democrats protested this irregu- larity - introducing a bill after debate had been termi- nated - then-Lieutenant Governor Kay Ivey allowed for three minutes of debate.

Senator Roger Bedford, a Black Democrat, called it a \"back-room deal.\" Sen. Quinton Ross, also a Black Democrat, said, \"Not hing about their plan was transparent.\"50 The House then approved a plan introduced by Representative Micky Hammon, a white Republican, that essentially restored the committee plan, leaving out the Beason adjustments. Black members of the House, including James Busky, made the same protes-tations as their colleagues in the senate - the plan packed Black voters into the 7th and cracked them eve- rywhere else. Busky argued, \"That's stacking blacks in a congressional district [and] there's no need to do it.\" Busky introduced a plan that would have placed some Black voters from the 7th in to the 2nd District, but it failed along party lines. The bill that was finally ap- proved, out of a six-member conference committee, es- sentially adopted the Hammon Plan, and therefore produced a map preserving the basic characteristics of the Larry Dixon Plan, as modified by Walker and Hina- man. It was signed by Go vernor Robert Bentley on June 8, 2011. 51 The legislative Black Caucus and the state Demo- cratic Conference challenge d the state's plan as dis- criminatory, and a federal court took up the issue.

A suit had been brought by officials in Shelby County, Alabama, seeking the end of Section 5 pre- clearance. The leader of the Alabama Democratic Con- ference, Joe Reed, argued that the state, in going to the court, was trying to fast-t rack preclearance in order make it harder for people to register opposition, partic- ularly to the fact that a map could have been drawn that included either two majority-Black districts or at least 1 majority-Black district and one \"opportunity\" district. Two months later, and one day before the trail court upheld Section 5 in Shelby County v. Holder , the Attorney General precleared the state's congressional plan. This severed that issue from the Alabama Legis- lative Black Caucus case, which moved forward in a contentious battle over the state's legislative districts, the maps for which were drawn by Hinaman. Twelve of those districts were determined by the court to be unconstitutionally gerrymandered. The trial court ul- timately approved the state's plans in 2017. 52 52 State of Alabama v.

FACTOR 5: EFFECTS OF PAST DI SCRIMINA- TION Education, income, health, and legal vulnerability adversely affect political participation. Black Alabam- ians still suffer under the socioeconomic weight of that past and from continuing racism, even at the highest levels of government. 53 As the court acknowledged in Alabama State Conference of the NAACP v. Alabama in 2020, \"Though things have changed, the effects of . . . discrimination persist to some degree\" (CA 2:16- cv-00731-WKW-SMD, Feb. 5, 2020, MD, pp. 153-54). Black citizens in Alabama lag behind their white counterparts in nearly every statistical socioeco- nomic category, due largely to a history of discrimi- nation, only elements of which are sketched above. When Congress amended Section II of the VRA, amid the apportionment fight that immediately preceded the adoption of the Dixon Plan, the 11th Circuit recog-nized the impact that a century of discrimination had on Black Alabamians. In doing so, the court quoted the Senate Report from which the Gingles Senate Factors were derived: The courts have recognized that dispropor- tionate educational, employment, income level, and living conditions arising from past discrimination tend to depress minority polit-ical participation. . . . Where these conditions 53 In 2011, the court in United States v. McGregor acknowl- edged that \"racist sentiments . . . remain regrettably entrenched in the high echelons [Alabama] state government\" (824 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1344-1348, MD). JA230 are shown, and where the level of black par- ticipation is depressed, plaintiffs need not prove any further causal nexus between their disparate socio-economic status and the de-pressed level of political participation. 54 Today, white Alabamians with more education and therefore higher income can afford a car, internet ser- vice, a personal computer, or a smart phone; they can take time off from work; th ey can afford to contribute to political campaigns; they can afford to run for office; they have access to better healthcare. Education has repeatedly been found to correlate with income inde-pendently affects citizens' ability to engage politically. Black people in Alabama are demonstrably poorer, less educated, less healthy, and far more likely to be incar-cerated than white people as a consequence of past and continuing racism and discrimination. According to the most recent available data from the U.S. Census Bu-reau's American Community Survey, Black Alabami- ans are less likely to have completed high school, more likely to live below the pove rty line, more likely to be unemployed, more likely to wo rk in a service industry job, more likely to rent rather than own their home, more likely to lack access to a vehicle, and more likely to have a significantly lower median household income than white households.

Merrill in 2020, \"people who are Black, Latinx, or Native Ameri- can are more likely to hold jobs that do not provide paid leave, cannot be performed remotely, and require more exposure to the public and, therefore, to COVID-19.\" The parties to that action stipulated to the fact that \"the discrimination and systemic racism that con- tribute to elevated COVID-19 risk for Black people and other minorities nationally are evident in Ala-bama,\" wherein COVID-19 has also had a dispropor- tionate impact on Black p eople in Alabama in terms of rate of infection and rate of death due to, in the words of the court, \"pre-existing and evolving inequi- ties in structural systems and social conditions. 56 The 55 U.S. Bureau of Census, American Community Survey Data Profiles, Alabama, 2018, http s://www.census.gov/acs/www/data/ data-tables-and-tools/data-profiles/2018/. 56 Findings of Fact and Conclusions 2:20-cv- 00619-AKK (MD), Times pub- lished the results of a study, backed by input from healthcare experts, that found socioeconomic factors with historical roots - such as access to healthy food options, access to decent healthcare, inability to work from home, etc. - were causal factors in COVID-19's more deadly effect s on Black persons. Infectious disease experts at the Centers for Disease Control (\"CDC\") also determined that \"Long-standing sy stemic health and social ineq- uities have put some members of racial and ethnic minority groups at increased risk of getting COVID-19 or experiencing se-vere illness, regardless of age.\" According to the CDC, at the JA232 court in People First also acknowledged that \"due to patterns resulting from a history of housing discrim- ination, Black and Latinx individuals are more likely to live in areas impacte d by environm ental pollu- tants, or in densely populated areas.\"57 This includes areas in Alabama that have been designated as \"Su- perfund\" cleanup sites by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), which I discuss in more detail below.58 The COVID-19 pandemic has also had a disparate impact on Black school chil dren. When school systems were forced to go online, Black children in the Black Belt in Alabama and in the state's urban areas were more likely to lack internet access or a computer, tab- let, or smart phone, rendering them incapable of con-tinuing in school. As a princ ipal at a school in Perry height of the summer surge in COVID last year, \"age-adjusted hospitalization rates [were] highest among non-Hispanic Ameri-can Indian or Alaska Native and non-Hispanic black persons, fol-lowed by Hispanic or Latino persons.\" CDC figures indicated that the age-adjusted hospitalization ra te for Black people was at that time \"approximately 5 times that of non-Hispanic white persons.\" Richard A.

Most either stabi- lized or saw increases in enrollment from 2020-2021 to fall 2021-2022. All but one school system in the state that saw a 5 percent or greater continued loss of en- rollment in that span are in the Black Belt; the other is Chickasaw City, which is an overwhelmingly Black system in greater Mobile. 60 Black people in the state also continue to face workforce discrimination, including on the part of the state. Of the 1,539 claims of discrimination brought be- fore the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2020 from Alabama, 45 percent were racially based claims, the highest percentage of any state in America. Alabama's racially based clai ms accounted for 3.1 per- cent of national racial claims, although Alabama's pop- ulation accounts, as of the last Census, for only 1.5 percent of the national population. 61 Litigation in the 59 Nellie Peyton, \" 'Who is standing up for us?' - Black, rural students left behind as U.S. schools go online,\" Reuters , Aug.

In both the Justice Department report and in a recent New York Times piece featuring letters from multiple inmate s, a picture emerges of a system in Alabama in which correctional of ficers are so outnumbered and conditions are so systemically vi-olent that officers and staff often simply hide behind barricades and allow the prison population to police it- self. Rape, stabbings, attacks on both officers and other inmates, drug use, and corruption all appear to be com- monplace. 66 The representation of Black people among the incarcerated in Alabama is grossly disproportionate. As of a January 2020 report issued by the Alabama Department of Corrections (\"ADOC\"), Black inmates accounted for the majority of the inmate population, despite Black people only co nstituting 27 percent of the state's population. Alabama's prisons are also catastrophically overcrowded; the state was recently criticized for trying to address overcrowding by pledging funds intended for COVID-19 relief to the 66 \"Investigation of Alabama's State Prisons for Men,\" United States Department of Justice, Civi l Rights Division, April 2, 2019, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pres s-release/file/1150276/download; New York Times Staff, \" 'No One Feels Safe Here': Life in Ala-bama's Prisons,\" New York Times , April 29, 2019, https://www. nytimes.com/2019/04/29/us/alabama-prison-inmates.html; Mike Cason, \"New Department of Justice complaint says Alabama has not improved prison condit ions since building of new prisons, thereby taking funds away from one crisis that disproportionately affects Black people to address another one.67 Even when released, especially in Alabama, former Black inmates find it harder to exercise their righ t to vote.

After visiting a Black man's Butler County home, where sewage was bubbling up out of the ground due to a failed septic tank, Alston assessed the situation, say- ing, \"There is a human right for people to live decently, and that means the government has an obligation to provide people with the essent ials of life, which include power, water and sewage service.\" He added, \"But if the government says, 'oh no, we're not going to do it,' and leaves you to install very expensive septic tanks, that's not how it should work.\" Under H.B. 1, the state's cur- rent congressional plan, Butler County lies in the 2nd Congressional District. 71 Black residents of Uniontown, in Perry County, fought a decision by the stat e to allow 4 million tons of potentially toxic coal ash to be transferred from the site of a coal-fired electrical plant accident in Tennes- see to a landfill in the town.

Board , a 3-judge federal trial court found that state officials had, \"through their control and influence over\" local school boards, \"flouted every effort to make the Fourteenth Amendment a meaningful reality to Negro school children in Ala- bama\" ( Lee v. Macon County Board of Education , 267 F.Supp. 458, MD, affirmed 389 U.S. 215). The court en- joined state officials and, by proxy, 99 school systems across the state, along with the state's junior colleges and trade schools, and event ually its teachers' associa- tions and athletic associations. The state's actions be- fore, during, and after the trial of that case on the merits demonstrate the vigo r with which it resisted granting basic rights to Black citizens. When Brown was decided in 1954, the NAACP in Alabama petitioned local school boards for a commit- ment to adhere to the ruling. White men who rejected the violent efforts of the Ku Klux Klan, especially the aforementioned state legislator Sam Engelhardt, re- sponded by organizing Citizens' Councils, which used economic reprisal to puni sh Black people who pressed for school desegregation. Black plaintiffs nonetheless began to file suit in the late 1950s, seeking redress in federal courts, but not unt il 1963 did trial courts in four cases order the desegr egation of a handful of all- white schools. Klansmen then bombed a Black church in Birmingham in response, killing four children, and the governor and state legislature reinvigorated an JA244 already decades-long running campaign to keep public schools in the state entirely white.74 After the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (\"HEW\") pressed local school systems to desegregate. Governor George Wallace intimidated local school boards, threatening to remove state funding or to hold \"mass meetings\" in any county or town whose school board agreed to abide by HEW provisions or federal court orders. When the court added the United States as a party in Lee v. Macon , it brought the Justice De- partment into the case. Attorneys from the CRD and for the private litigants recognized that, not only had Wallace demonstrated that he had control over local school boards, but Alabama la w gave the state Board of Education control over loc al boards, even in day-to- day affairs, a reality traceable to the state's first \"re- deemer\" constitution. Plaintiffs asked the court to com-pel the state to use that power to desegregate, rather than to prevent desegregation, and to issue a statewide desegregation order, wh ich it did in March 1967. 75 74 Bagley, The Politics of White Rights , pp. 14-76; Armstrong v.

JA246 desegregation plan that fall. Private plaintiffs and the CRD would monitor progress and submit motions for further relief, as necessary. Gradually, each local school system would become a defendant party in the suit. The court, with plaintiffs' counsel, determined when the systems had reached a point at which a consent decree could be entered and the individual system's case could be transferred to a single judge in their dis- trict. Plaintiffs and the court would continue to moni- tor progress until \"unitary status,\" as articulated in Green v. County School Board of New Kent County (391 U.S. 430, 1968), had been achieved. As a direct result of recalcitrance from officials at the state and local level, the \"freedom of choice\" plans adopted under the initial model plan had not, by the 1970s, resulted in actual integration, only token deseg- regation. And as Circuit Judge John Minor Wisdom ex- plained, the goal of school desegregation litigation had always been to move beyond a scenario in which there were still \"white schools or Negro schools\" to one in where there were \"just schools,\" or in other words, to have a \" bona fide unitary system\" ( U.S. v. Jefferson County Board of Education , 372 F.2d 836, para. 172, 5th CCA, 1965). Courts began to grant relief when plaintiffs moved for the adoption of compulsory assign- ment plans. Compulsory assignment led to a renewed white revolt against desegr egation - violent, litigious, political, and otherwise - and many whites fled for JA247 exclusively or overwhelmingly white suburbs or pri- vate schools.77 Desegregation litigation continues today, and in some areas, segregation has gotten worse. As of 2020 nearly 50 school systems remain under desegregation orders. The Huntsville schools case remains active be- fore this Court, for example, as several more factors, including student discipline, have not been adequately addressed. In the 2019-2020 school year, for example, 52 percent of Black students at Huntsville High re- ceived a disciplinary referral, compared to just 12 per- cent of white students. 78 Segregation in the state's metropolitan areas is al- most as profound, with white families having left cities like Birmingham and Montgo mery for suburbs with majority white, independent school systems or for pri- vate schools. In the Stout v. Jefferson County case, this Court recently granted, in part, the motion of the City of Gardendale, to separate from the Jefferson County 77 Bagley, The Politics of White Rights , pp. 146-79. 78 Yue Qiu and Nikole Hannah-Jones, A National Survey of School Desegregation Orders, Dec. 5:63-CV-00109-MHH, 2015, WL 13398941 (ND); No Author, \"Huntsville partial unitary status in desegregation system, even Court found that \"race was a motivating factor\" and that such motivation was \"de- plorable\" ( Stout v.

In February of 2018, the order was reversed by the 11th Circuit, which affirmed the finding of discriminatory intent and blocked the City of Gardendale's attempt to separate.79 Recent litigation has addressed ongoing inequities and discrimination in schools across the state. The mother of a former student at Franklin County's Phil Campbell High School filed suit in January after her son was subjected to numerous incidents of racist har- assment by white students. White administrators not only failed to address the harassment, but punished the Black student on more than one occasion. The Leeds Board of Education, after being sued by the par- ents of Black children in an ongoing desegregation case, agreed to restart its school lunch program. The board had shut the program down, citing Governor Kay Ivey's COVID stay-at-home order. Plaintiffs suc-cessfully argued that school lunch programs were ex- empt from the order and that suspending the program disproportionately affected Black children enrolled in the school system, some 80 percent of whom are eco- nomically disadvantaged. 80 79 Stout and U.S. v.

City of Leeds Board 2:17-MC- As recently as November 2021, white students in Alabama schools have made patently racist remarks and posted them online. White students at Cullman High School circulated a video, which was received by Black students, of a white student chanting \"white power\" and \"kill all the n ----rs.\" The student was the child of a member of the local board of education. A year prior to that, white students at Mountain Brook High School circulated a video showing students laughing and doing the Nazi salute as another student paraded around with swastikas on his back. The school board formed a diversity committee, which recom- mended anti-bias training, which the school system never implemented. A year before that incident, stu- dents at Hoover High Sch ool were filmed having the following exchange: Student 1, \"F--- n------'s , f--- Jews;\" Student 2, \"Jews are they're white. We just need the n----'s gone.\" 81 was harassed, sues Franklin County school for raci al discrimina- action al.com , April 17, 2020, https://www.al.com/news/2020/04/stopping- school-meals-violates-federal-desegregation-order-group-says.html. 81 Trisha Powell Crane, \"Alabama high school students \"Jew ish concerned about video of Mountain Brook children drawing swastika,\" May 13, wrestle with impact of racist video,\" al.com, JA250 The Alabama Accountability Act, enacted in 2013, labels the bottom 6 percent of the state's schools, by proficiency in reading and math, as \"failing,\" borrow- ing from the No Child Left Behind extension of the El-ementary and Secondary Education Act. For 2020- 2021, as in previous years, all 75 schools on the list of failing schools were majority Black, most overwhelm- ingly so. Most of the schools are in majority-Black school systems in or ar ound Birmingham, Montgom- ery, and Mobile, or in the Black Belt. 82 Courts have also found that Alabama's institu- tions of higher learning have been plagued by \"vestiges of segregation,\" decades after the initiation of court-or- 1352, ND, 1991). The University of Alabama and Auburn University were desegregated in the 1960, but in 1991, a trial court in Knight v. Alabama found that the state was still obligated to eliminate the lingering effects of segregation and discrimination in those in- stitutions, and their proposed satellites, and to make an effort to recruit Black stud ents to those schools and to recruit white students to the state's Historically Black Colleges and Univer sities (HBCUs). After a partial reversal, the court in 1995 issued a remedial decree similar to that issued in Lee v. Macon , with the court overseeing implementation over the next https://www.al.com/news/2021/11/i-cant-say-anything-alabama- students-parents-wrestle-with- impact-of-racist-video.html. 82 Trisha Powell Crane, \"Here's of 'failing' schools failing-schools-in-alabama_html. JA251 decade.83 Prior to that window closing, the Knight plaintiffs argued that the state had been \"shielding the property of whites from being taxed to support the ed- ucation of blacks,\" thereby \"denying black citizens equal access to attend and to complete higher educa- tion.\" They cited two amendments to the state's 1901 constitution known as the \"Lid Bills.\" 84 c. The Lid Bills The original Lid Bill was conceived by state sena- tor Walter Givhan, a Citizens' Council pioneer and ar- guably the most prolific segregationist lawmaker in Alabama history, in 1972. Four converging factors mo-tivated Sen. Givhan: government-enabled white flight turning Black Belt public school systems all-Black; Black candidates beginning to get elected in those same districts thanks to en forcement of the VRA; the state legislature being forced to adopt an equitable re- apportionment; and a federal trial court ruling in Weissinger v. Boswell insisting that the state overhaul its tax assessment system. 85 Givhan proposed consti- tutionalizing a scheme in which residential, farm, and timber land would be assessed at a lower percentage (15 percent) than commercial property (25 percent) or utilities property (30 percent). To this was added a 1.5 83 Bagley, The Politics of White Rights , pp. 5-6, 223-24. , pp. 5-6, 223-24; Knight v. Alabama, affirmed in part, 14 F.3d 1534 (11th CCA, 1994), 900 F.Supp 272 (ND, 1995) (Knight II). 85 Bagley, The Politics of White Rights , pp. 210-15; Weissin- ger v. Boswell, 330 F.Supp 615 (MD, AL 1971). JA252 percent \"lid\" or cap on the total ad valorem tax revenue that could be collected from any piece of property. Un- derlying this effort was the fact that almost all of the land in the Alabama Black Belt was owned by white people or corporations controlled by them. The bill passed and was ratified by voters. 86 By the end of the decade, white lawmakers and property owners had begun to worry that Black elected officials might exercise a \"loc al option\" in the original Lid Bill that allowed county or municipal governments to raise millage rates, provided such measures passed through the state legislature . With Black political rep- resentation increasing not just in the Black Belt but also in cities like Birmingham and Mobile, the fear was that an alliance of urban representatives, Black and white, and rural Black officials might allow the latter to raise tax millage rates. The Mobile Press-Register explained that white lawmakers were \"fearful that the black political leaders, who also enjoy voting majori- ties, will exercise local options and set property taxes at the highest rates possible in order to raise addi-tional funds for their governmental operations,\" with such taxes being paid by \"white owners of large farms and corporate interests with large timberland hold-ings.\" As state Republican Party Chairman John Grenier would later acknowledge, \"The problem with the property tax, like everything, goes back to race in Alabama. I think probably whit es feel like they own the property, and the property tax goes up, and 86 Bagley, The Politics of White Rights , pp. 210-15. JA253 proceeds will go to blacks.\"87 George Wallace lent his support to a new bill that removed the local option, lowered the assessment rate for farm and timber land, and lowered the overall lid to one percent. It also al-lowed for \"current use\" asse ssment of land, as opposed to fair market value, whic h considered potential devel- opment, among other factors. State voters ratified the new amendment in 1978. 88 The plaintiffs in Knight called historians to testify, who linked the Lid Bills to the redeemer constitutions of 1875 and 1901 and to a histor ical rejection of white tax dollars for Black education. The experts argued that the lingering effects of the amendments prevented Black students from enjoying equal access to higher education in the state. The court in 2004 agreed that the Lid Bills were a part of Alabama's long and abys- mal history of race discrimination but denied the plaintiffs' claim on the ground that the action was an improper venue for a claim seeking their invalidation or injunction. A new case, targeting only the Lid Bills, was filed in 2008. 89 In a 2011 decision in Lynch v. Alabama , the court insisted that it was limite d by the Supreme Court's de- cision in San Antonio v. Rodriguez - in which the Court denied that there is a fundamental constitutional right 87 Grenier quoted in Allen Tullos, Alabama Getaway: The Po- litical Imaginary and the Heart of Dixie (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2011), p. 188; Mobile Press-Register quoted in Bag- ley, The Politics of White Rights , pp. 210-15. 88 Bagley, The Politics of White Rights , pp. 210-15. 89 The Politics of White Rights , pp. 224-26. JA254 to equal educational opportunity - and that the de- fendants were arguably moti vated by a history of an- tipathy to taxation that was independent of race discrimination. However, the court acknowledged, in a very lengthy opinion, the di scriminatory effects of Ala- bama's property taxation scheme and cited the plain- tiffs' expert witness historians, who fleshed out the testimony in Knight , linking the Lid Bills to the state's white supremacist constitutions. The court agreed that the property tax scheme enshrined by the amend-ments was \"crippling\" Black education in the state. 90 At the time Lynch was decided, Alabama had not only the lowest property tax revenues in the United States, but they were also twice as low as the state coming in at number 49 and three times lower than the national average. A mere five percent of the state's tax revenue came from property taxes. Most of it came from regressive sales and incomes taxes that dispro-portionately affect poor people, of which Black people are disproportionately represented in Alabama. The 11th Circuit appellate court acknowledged this and in-sisted that it was \"cognizant of Alabama's deep and troubled history of racial discrimination,\" which had been \"illustrated vividly by th e plaintiffs at trial.\" But it could find no legal fault in the trial court's ruling, since the plaintiffs were held to the standard of prov- ing discriminatory intent. The Senate Factors, 90 Lynch v. Alabama, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 155012 (ND, AL, 2011), 798-800, Lexis-Nexis Academic . JA255 however, allow plaintiffs to consider the effects of past discrimination, which seem here to be relevant.91 IV. FACTOR 6: POLITIC AL CAMPAIGNS CHAR- ACTERIZED BY RACIAL APPEALS White lawmakers in Alabama learned long ago to colormask their public stat ements, just as they have learned to colormask the legislation intended to pro-tect their racial prerogatives. Not since the high-tide of brazen white supremacy, when George Wallace pro- claimed, \"segregation forever, \" have public figures been so bold. Skilled politicians have since mastered the art of deploying coded racial appeals, and historians have been able to home in on certain messages that lawmak-ers know will resonate with white voters. Yet even to- day, in campaign ads and in other public speech, including on social media, white Alabama politicians reveal that direct invocations of race still appeal to white voters. This is not to say that this or that white elected official is \"racist,\" but to acknowledge that ra-cial appeals are present in campaigns. 92 91 Lynch v.

JA256 Former United States Senate candidate Roy Moore, who was twice remove d from the state Supreme Court for failure to obey federal court orders, won the Republican Party nomination in 2017 for the seat va-cated by candidate Jeff Sessions when he became At- torney General. During the campaign, Moore insisted that the United States would be better off without any of the Amendments to the Constitution that follow the 10th. Moore argued, \"That would eliminate many prob- lems. You know, people don't understand how some of these amendments have completely tried to wreck the form of government that our forefathers intended.\" This would of course include the 13th Amendment, which ended slavery, and the 15th Amendment, which established voting rights for Freedmen. Moore singled out the 14th Amendment, which was enacted to protect the rights of former enslaved people, insisting that it \"allow[s] the federal government to do something which the first 10 amendments prevented them from doing.\" Moore has also described the antebellum period in the South as follows: \"I think it was great at the time when families were united - even though we had slav-ery. They cared for one another. People were strong in the families. Our families we re strong. Our country had a direction.\" 93 93 Philip Bump, \"Roy Moore: America was great in era of slavery, is now 'focus of evil in the world,' \" Washington -in-era-of-slavery-is-now-focus- of-evil-in-the-world/; German Lopez, \"Roy Moore was once again caught making that can be interpreted as okay with slavery: maybe he believes what he keeps saying,\" Vox, Dec. 11, 2017, JA257 Another Alabama jurist, state Supreme Court Chief Justice Tom Parker, in 2018 ran a campaign ad that a federal trial court found to be based upon a ra- cial appeal. Justice Parker targeted the Southern Pov-erty Law Center, an advocacy group for minorities, and made clear that he opposed \"the leftist mob tr[ying] to destroy our society\" showing at that moment images of U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, a Black member of Congress from California. The trial court concluded that, \"when juxtaposed with images of an African- American Democratic congresswoman from California who had no other reason to appear in an ad for an Al- abama judicial race . . . one of the motives of the ad was to draw attention to race\" ( Alabama State Conf. of the NAACP v. Alabama , CASE NO. 2:16-CV-731-WKW, @ p. 153). Mo Brooks, Republican U.S. Congressman for Ala- bama's 5th District, has repeatedly claimed that Dem-ocrats are waging a \"war on whites\" by \"claiming that whites hate everybody else.\" In 2016, Brooks ex- plained, \"They are trying to motivate the African American vote to vote-blo c for Democrats by using every Republican as a racist tool that they can envi- sion.\" Brooks has also char acterized people who re- ceive assistance through th e Supplemental Nutrition Assistance, or SNAP, program as undeserving.

JA258 applauding cuts to the program, the beneficiaries of which in Alabama would includ e tens of thousands of Black people, Brooks said, \"It is wrong to let slackers take roughly $70 billion per year from hard-working taxpayers who need that money for their own needs.\" Such colormasked appeals are a product of half a cen- tury of connecting federal welfare and public health programs with racial animosity and deploying coded attacks on the former with appeals to the latter. 94 Representative Bradley Byrne of the state's 1st Congressional District, when he was vying for a Senate seat, aired a campaign ad in which he condemned 94 Massie, \"Rep.

He shifts to lamenting the course the country is taking, as the faces of Black and Brown people appear in the fire. Former National Football League quarterback Colin Kaepernick appears in the fire, as Byrne calls him an \"entitled athlete dishonor- ing\" the American flag. Members of the Congressional caucus known as \"The Squad,\" including Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, appear in the fire and are accused of \"attacking America\" and \"cheapening 9/11.\" No white people appear in the fire. 95 U.S. Representative Barry Moore has repeatedly downplayed the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol insurrec-tion and has Tweeted about the shooting of Capitol-in- filtrator Ashli Babbitt by U.S. Capitol Police, \"I understand it was a black police officer that shot the white female veteran.

FACTOR VII: THE EXTENT TO WHICH MINOR- ITIES HAVE BEEN ELECTED TO OFFICE Since Reconstruction, three Black candidates have won election to the U.S. House of Representatives from majority-Black districts, with never more than one serving at any given time. Despite constituting almost 27 percent of the state's voting-age population, Black voters only form an effective voting majority, or any- thing approaching that, in on e out of the state's seven congressional districts (14 percent). 98 Faces Backlash after Posting an d Deleting Meme on Kenosha Shooting Suspect,\" Newsweek , Aug. 30, newsweek.com/alabama-gop-congressional-candidate-faces-back lash-after-posting-deleting-me me-kenosha-shooting-1528614. 97 Brent Wilson, \"Chris Pringle: Southern Christian Conservatives Under Attack,\" Feb. 18, 2020, https://www.bamapolitics.co m/47024/chris-pr ingle-white- straight-southern-christian- conservatives-under-attack/. 98 U.S. Census Quick Fact s, Alabama, https://www. census.gov/quickfacts/AL. JA261 Black citizens hold no statewide offices in Ala- bama. Only three Black individuals have ever held any statewide office, despite Bl ack candidates having run for Governor, Lieutenant Governor, U.S. Senate, Secre-tary of State, and state Auditor. Civil rights attorney Oscar Adams was appointed to a justiceship on the state Supreme Court in 1980 and won reelection in 1982 and 1988. Adams was replaced by Ralph Cook upon his retirement in 1993, and Justice Cook was able to win reelection in 1994. Justice John England was appointed to the court in 1999, but both he and Cook lost their reelection bids in 2000. Cook and Adams are the only African American ca ndidates to ever run for and win statewide office. There are currently no Black judges on the state's Supreme Court or the Courts of Appeals. 99 Only through enforcement of the VRA, through CRD administrative action, and through litigation, in-cluding Gingles and Dillard , were Black voters able to register to vote and to elec t candidates of their choice to the Alabama state legislature. The vast majority of Black representatives in the legislature today repre- sent majority-Black district s that were created with judicial oversight, federal a dministrative oversight, or under the specter of litigation. 99 OF RESPONSIVENESS The state's lack of resp onsiveness to the needs of Black Alabamians is exemplified by Black lawmak- ers failed efforts to advoca te for a second majority- minority Congressional dis trict, something that has been repeatedly rejected by white lawmakers. State representative Prince Chestnut, named-plaintiff in a redistricting lawsuit that pending when the 2020 Census was published, ar gued that a second Con- gressional majority-minorit y district would not only more accurately reflect, in the ability of Black voters to elect candidates of their choice to Congress, the percentage of the Black vo ting age population, it would also, \"have the effect of more people in Ala-bama having representation that is congruent with their beliefs and ideals.\" 100 Representative Merika Coleman, Senate Minority Leader Bobby Singleton, and Senator Rodger Smither- man introduced Congressional redistricting plans in 2021 that provided for a either a second majority-mi- nority district or a Black \"opportunity\" district, but these were brushed aside by the Senator McClendon and Representative Pringle, the co-chairs of the Redis- tricting Committee. Senator McClendon has said of the possibility of drawing a second majority-minority dis-trict, \"There is probably a way to maneuver around [and create two majority-minority districts], but it Nov. Adver- tiser, May 2, Nov. 3, 2021. JA263 would be gerrymandering at its best [and] doesn't make sense at all.\"101 Lack of responsiveness is also evident in the state's response to the COVID-19 crisis. Black citizens have experienced higher rates of infection and death, and they have suffered from inequitable distribution of vaccines. White neighborhoods and suburbs in Bir- mingham and Mobile, for example, received vaccine doses months before, and in higher proportions, than poorer Black communities in those cities did. 102 As of June 23, 2020, there had b een 30.4 deaths per 100,000 people in the state among Black people and 12.5 deaths per 100,000 among white people. State Health Officer Scott Harris explained that this was not a bio- logical phenomenon independent of sociohistorical fac-tors. Harris said, \"This is a disease that has worse outcomes in people that already have other social de- terminants like chronic health problems or issues just related to education and in come.\" As of March 2021, 101 Montgomery Advertiser , Nov. 3, 5, 2021. 102 Margaret Newkirk, \"A Blac k Neighborhood in Alabama Has Yet to Get a Single Vaccine, In a nearby wealthy White suburb, the doses flow,\" Bloomberg, Feb. 25, 2021, The South, COVID-19 Va ccine Sites Missing From Black And Hispanic Neighborhoods,\" NPR Morning Addition , Feb. 5, 2021, Abby Goodnough Hoffma n, Wealthy Are Getting More Vaccinations, Even in Poorer Neighborhoods,\" The New York Times , Feb. 2, 2021, https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/ 02/health/white-people-covid- vaccines-minorities.html; JA264 data by race still bore out that Black people were con- tracting the disease and dying from it at higher rates than white people.103 Much of what I discuss above under Factor 5 ap- plies here as well. Black ci tizens who live in impover- ished areas with lack of basic services and suffer the accompanying health issues, whose children attend \"failing\" schools and who lack transportation, or who otherwise do not have the means to attend some other school; whose children are disciplined more frequently in school or are subject to unequal treatment in the criminal justice system; whos e school systems are crip- pled by underfunding thanks to the state's property tax scheme; who suffer di scrimination in the work- place; who supported Birmingham's effort to raise the minimum wage only to see the state legislature block that effort: these are all people whose needs are not being met with a positive legislative response, either in the state legislature or in Congress.

Black cit-izens in Alabama are disproportionately harmed by the existence of the gap and the state's refusal to close it, despite insistence from the governor's own task force that doing so would actually have long-term fiscal and economic benefits for the state. According to a June 2020 report released by the Urban Institute in conjunction with the Robert Wood Johnson Founda-tion, Alabama would see the largest decrease in its un-insured rate, 43 percent, in the nation if it were to adopt expansion. According to a 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation report, some 224,000 Alabamians would become Medicaid eligible under expansion, 34 percent of them Black. 106 106 Cason, \"Gov. Robert Bentle y's task force recommends Medicaid expansion\"; Rachel Garfield et al., \"The Coverage Gap: Uninsured Poor Adults in States that Do Not Expand Medicaid,\" Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), Jan. 14, 2020, https://www_ kff.org/report-section/the-cover Fact Sheets,\" Jan 23, 2020, http://files. kff.org/attachment/fact-sheet- medicaid-expansion-AL; Michael Si mpson, \"The Implications of Medicaid Expansion in the Remaining States: 2020 Update,\" Urban Institute/ Robert Wood cospon- sored a bill that would allow the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to bypass state governments and work directly with local government entities and expand Medicaid coverage. Sew ell has said of the bill, \"Because of the State of Alabama's refusal to expand Medicaid, more than 200,000 low-income Alabamians who would otherwise qualify for health insurance cov- erage are being forced to go without care, putting their health and their lives at risk. If the State of Alabama won't expand access to health care for our underserved communities, local govern ments should have the power to do it themselves.\" 107 Representative Sewell is the only member of Ala- bama's Congressional delegation who voted Yes to the infrastructure bill that recently passed Congress with bipartisan support. All other representatives voted No, including one who subsequently touted a project that can now move forward with the funding that the state will be awarded under the bill. 108 107 Press Release from Office of Congresswoman Sewell, July 17, 2021, \"Rep.

JA268 VII: CONCLUSION Given Alabama's history of discrimination against Black citizens, the ongoing effects of that discrimina- tion, the inability of Black voters to elect candidates of their choice to statewide office, the relative lack of rep-resentation of Black citizens in the state's Congres- sional delegations, and lawmaker's consistent lack of responsiveness to the needs of Black voters, the total-ity of the circumstances demonstrate that Black Ala- bamians lack an equal o pportunity to right to participate in the political process and elect candidates of their choice.

Do you recognize this? A. I do. JA270 Q. Does this appear to be a true and correct of the 2021 congressional map? A. It does. Q. We were talking about Montgomery County here not wanting to be split. A. Three ways, yes. (Plaintiff 's Exhibit 6 was marked for identification.) Q. I'm also going to hand you what's being marked as Plaintiff 's Exhibit 6 for your reference. This is a copy of the 2011 congressional map. So looking at Montgomery County, it looks like in - well, first off, Plaintiff 's Exhibit 6, does that appear to be a true and correct copy of the 2011 congressional map, to your knowledge? A. It does. Q. We were - and you used this 2011 congres- sional map as the starting point in drafting the 2021 congressional map, correct? A. I used the cores of the existing [94] districts as a starting point, yes. Q. Is that different from using this map as the starting point? A. I don't know. I don't think so. Q. When you began drawing the 2021 congres- sional map, you didn't start from scratch, right? JA271 A. No. Correct. Q. You started using the 2011 congressional map? A. Correct. Q. Looking at Montgomery County, so that was split into three districts in 2011; is that right? A. That's correct. Q. Do you know why that was split into three dis- tricts at the time? A. Not specifically, other than, obviously, it had been - Congressman Mike Rogers in the 3rd District had had an office in Montgomery, that part of Mont- gomery County, and had represented it for a while and probably didn't - didn't want to lose that base of sup- port and financial support and so forth. Q. In the 2011 congressional map, District [95] 7 reaches into a portion in the middle of Montgomery County. Do you know why it does that? A. To gain population for that district. Q. Was District 7 reaching into a portion of Montgomery County in the prior 2001 congressional map? A. I don't know. Q. Do you remember if Montgomery County - do you remember if District 7 reached into a portion of JA272 Montgomery County in the 1992 congressional map that you drew? A. I do not remember, no. I'm sure somebody has a map and could tell me. But I don't know. Q. So it looks like from the 2011 congressional map to the 2021 congressional map, you were able to take District 3 out of Montgomery so that it's not split three ways anymore and is on ly split two ways; is that correct? A. That's correct. Q. Is there a reason why it still needed to be split into two different districts? A. Yeah. I mean, obviously, the 7th District was underpopulated. So if you took it all the way out of Montgomery, then you would have to [96] add a num- ber of different counties to make up that population. Q. Well, it looks like District 7 also includes only a portion of Tuscaloosa County and Jefferson County, correct? A. That's correct. Q. So could you not have taken more of either Tuscaloosa County or Jeffers on County and then been able to leave Montgomery County as being solely in one district? A. Well, yeah, it would have been possible cer- tainly in Jefferson. I don't know about Tuscaloosa. I don't think actually - I think there are many more JA273 people in the 7th District po rtion of Montgomery than there are in the 4th District portion of Tuscaloosa. But yes, certainly in Jefferson that would have been possi- ble. But as you know, they - these all have to fit back together at the end. So what might have been a perfect map for somebody in Montgomery may not have cre- ated a perfect situation for whatever member repre- sented Jefferson or wherever. Q. Did you consider moving - did you consider making Montgomery County solely District 2? A. I did not. [97] Q. Why not? A. Because, again, I didn't think it - while that may look like geographically not a very large area, it has a considerable number of voters in it. And it would have been hard to take that out of 7 and make up the population somewhere else. About the only place, as yo u pointed out, to do that might have been Jefferson. But, again, we have two representatives in Jefferson County right now. And it would have been hard to eliminate one from that pro-cess. Q. Is there anything in part icular about this spe- cific portion of Montgomery County that's in District 7 that makes it a community of interest or something that ties it into District 7 versus District 2? JA274 A. Not necessarily. I mean, obviously, geograph- ically it's next to - it's adjacent to Lowndes County. Q. Did you look at racial data in including that portion of Montgomery County in District 7? A. I didn't. When we started doing - I didn't ini- tially. When we started filling in this - all these discus- sions we've had up until now have all been based on total pop. I didn't look at race [98] at all on the com-puter when we were adding folks to these districts or subtracting folks from these districts. So at this point, I've bas ically just been looking at total pop and where do you get the total pop to get the districts back to ideal population. So at that point, there was no discussion of ra ce. It was all a discussion of total pop. Q. You say \"at this point.\" Where are we talking in the timeline? A. Up until - up until we finished the map. Q. Finishing the map being the week before the special session? A. Correct. Q. So is it your testimony that you did not look at race at all in 2021 before submitting the maps to the special session? A. No, I did not look at it up until the week be- fore we submitted the maps, when at that point we JA275 did turn on race and look at the racial breakdowns in the various maps. Q. Why did you look at the racial breakdown that week before the special session? [99] A. Well, to - obviously, we wanted to see what the, you know, outcomes of our changes were. Q. What do you mean? A. We wanted to see what - the changes we had made to get the population balanced among all these districts, if it changed any of the, you know, racial makeup of the districts. Q. Why did you want to know that? A. Well, one of our guidelines is to comply with the Voting Rights Act. Q. And you say \"we wanted.\" Who is \"we\"? A. The two co-chairs, myself, and legal counsel. Q. \"Legal counsel\" being Mr. Dorman - A. Yes. Q. - Walker? A. Yes. Q. And prior to that week before the special ses- sion, it's your testimony that you did not look at any of the racial data at all for any of the districts in drawing the 2021 congressional map? JA276 A. That's correct. Q. What data did you look at? A. Just - just total pop and geography. [100] Q. Anything else? A. That's it. Q. Other than modifying the existing district lines to account for population changes, did you make any other changes from the 2011 congressional map? A. I'm not sure I follow that. Q. You made changes to the 2011 congressional map for the 2021 map based on changes in population, correct? A. Correct. Q. Did you make any changes based on any other factors? A. Are we talking - we're talking the 2021 map? Q. Correct. So in drawing the 2021 map, you made certain changes from the prior map based on changes in population, correct? A. Correct. Q. Did you make any changes based on any other factors? A. No. I didn't make any changes. Obviously, where members lived was a consideration. I certainly JA277 would be mindful - when I was moving a precinct in Jefferson County, for example, I * * * [153] Q. What is your definition of a community of interest? A. My definition of community of interest, it can be geographic, it can be economic, where people work, it can be racial, it could be geography, it could be people on the bay, for example, for Mobile and Baldwin coun- ties. A host of - a host of communities of interest. Q. What do you consider to be communities of in- terest in Alabama? A. All those things I just listed. Q. Is there any sort of particular communities of interest that are well established or a list of any of these? Or is this just some thing that is subjectively known but doesn't really exist in writing anywhere? A. I don't know of a definitive list of all the com- munities of interest in Alabama. Q. Are there any specific communities of interest that come to mind for you right now? A. No, other than the ones I listed. I mean, pre- cincts can be - counties are, I guess, communities of interest sometimes. I mean, it's -there are a whole host of things. Q. It sounds like communit ies of interest [154] can be somewhat fluid. Is that fair to say? JA278 A. It is fair to say. Q. One area, say, where we're sitting right now in Montgomery, could be part of three, four, five, six dif-ferent communities of interest depending on what fac- tors you're looking at? A. Yeah, whether they're economic or racial or social or everybody roots for the same football team, I suppose. Q. Do they? A. No. Q. I see. I see. That would be a community of in- terest perhaps. Are you familiar with the black belt? You men- tioned that earlier. A. I am. Q. What is the black belt? A. It's a group of mostly rural counties that have a - for the most part have a majority black population. Q. Do you know what count ies are in the black belt? A. I'm not sure I can list every one. But yeah, in general, I do. Q. What counties would you say are in the [155] black belt? JA279 A. I would say Sumpter, Greene, Choctaw, Ma- rengo, Hale, Perry, Dallas, Wilcox, Lowndes, I guess Macon and Bullock. Some would say Montgomery. Q. Do you consider the black belt to be a commu- nity of interest? A. I do. Q. So in drawing your map, what did you do to make sure that your plan complies with this policy, that it respected communities of interest? A. Again, I mean, because there are so many dif- ferent communities of interest, they're not - I mean, no plan is going to respect all of them. So there are trade-offs. There are also - you know, the entire black belt I imagine if you made into a congressional district would accomplish - would hit up against other one person, one vote issues and other issues in here, as well. So they are sometimes in conflict. So you can't - you can't satisfy all communities of interest. Q. Did you have to make any specific modifica- tions to your map to make sure that you were respect- ing communities of interest? A. No. Although, again, I tried to keep, [156] for example, the Muscle Shoals area together in the - in the 4th District when we split Lauderdale. Not that it was at issue, but the people in Mobile and Baldwin very much wanted to be together because they share JA280 the bay. But that didn't require a change. It just is a . . . Q. Other than the modification for the Muscle Shoals community, are there any other specific modifi- cations that you felt like you made in drawing the 2021 map? A. No, not specifically. Q. Does your map split any communities of inter- est? A. Oh, I'm sure it does. I mean, all maps split some communities of interest. Q. And part of that is because of what we just discussed, that communities of interest can mean lots of different things? A. To different people, I'm sure. Q. Looking at the bottom of Section II j(iii,) that third policy, it gives a definition. It says, \"The term communities of interest\" -excuse me. It says, \"A community of interest is defined as an area with recognized similarities of [157] interests, in-cluding but not limited to ethnic, racial, economic, tribal, social, geographic, or historical identities. The term communities of interest may in certain circum-stances include political subdivisions such as counties, voting precincts, municipalities, tribal lands and reser- vations, or sc hool districts.\" JA281 Did you review any ethnic, racial, tribal, or other similar data to identify communities of interest? A. I did not. Q. Moving to the next policy, the fourth policy, Section II j(iv.) It states, \"T he legislature shall try to minimize the number of counties in each district.\" I think that's pretty sel f-explanatory. But what is your understanding of what that policy requires? A. Yeah, that's sort of a compactness thing. I was trying to keep the fewest number of counties necessary to - and it's not always -there are other - the next one down says \"preserving cores of existing districts.\" I mean, some of these things come into conflict. But to where possible, I tried to deal in * * * JA282 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA SOUTHERN DIVISION EVAN MILLIGAN, et al., Plaintiffs , vs. JOHN H. MERRILL, et al., Defendants . No. 2:21-cv-01530- AMM DECLARATION OF BENARD SIMELTON (Filed Dec. 15, 2021) I, Benard Simelton, declare as follows based on my per- sonal knowledge: 1. My name is Benard Simelton and I am the President of the Alabama St ate Conference of the NAACP (\"Alabama NAACP\"). The Alabama NAACP is a Plaintiff in this matter. 2. The Alabama NAACP is a non-profit and non- partisan organization and a state conference of the Na- tional Association for the Advancement of Colored Peo- ple. The Alabama NAACP was founded in 1913 and is the oldest civil rights organizations in the State. The Alabama NAACP works to ensure the political, educa-tional, social, and economic equality of African Ameri- cans, other minorities, and all residents of Alabama. We are committed to the removal of all discriminatory barriers to the democratic process, and the full enforce- ment of federal laws securing the right to vote. JA283 3. The Alabama NAACP fulfills its mission by seeking to increase voter re gistration and voter turn- out, engaging in voter registration and \"get-out-the- vote\" drives, and publicly advocating to address the ad-verse effects of racial discrimination in voting and to seek its elimination. 4. I have served as the President of the Alabama NAACP since October 2009. During my time as Presi- dent, I have overseen the Alabama NAACP's voter reg-istration, voter education and voter mobilization efforts. 5. As a non-profit organization, the Alabama NAACP raises money from private donors and mem- bership fees. The Alabama NAACP has two paid staff member but relies primarily on the assistance of vol- unteers, such as myself, to meet its goals. As a result, the Alabama NAACP's monetary, personnel and time resources are very limited. 6. The Alabama NAACP has thousands of mem- bers in Jefferson County, the Black Belt and other counties across the state. Mo st of the members of the Alabama NAACP are Black registered voters. The Al-abama NAACP's members include registered voters who reside and vote in CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7. Robert Clop- ton is a Black registered voter and President of the Mo-bile County NAACP Branch, currently located in CD 1. Bobby Mays is a Black registered voter and President of the NAACP Elmore County Branch #5026, currently located in CD 2. Alozo Bullie is a Black registered voter and President of the Macon County Branch NAACP, JA284 currently located in CD 3. Lisa Young is a Black regis- tered voter and President of the Tuscaloosa County NAACP Branch, currently located in CD7. 7. Members of the Alabama NAACP include Black registered voters who I understand would reside in the illustrative second m ajority-Black district pre- sented by Plaintiffs in this case. 8. The Alabama NAACP proposed a map in Oc- tober that would provide for two majority-minority dis- tricts prior to the state legis lature's special session to take up the redistricting issue. 9. The state's redistricting process was rushed and did not allow for adequate input from the Black community. Members of the NAACP attended reappor- tionment hearings and reported that Black state rep- resentatives did not have much time to present their support for the NAACP's map. It was as if the Commit- tee members minds were made up before public discus- sion took place. The plan proposing a second Black congressional district was rejected without much de- bate or attempt to understand the justification for it. It seemed as though acknowledging the NAACP's plan and listening to the opposition against HB-1 was a for- mality, but not seriously considered. 10. In the state's proposed maps, Black voters are packed into CD 7 where they are overrepresented. With two districts, economic and political interests would be better represented. Black voters need to have more than one representative from the state of Ala- bama to represent their interests in our US Congress. JA285 11. The Black Belt is a community of interest that should be kept together as much as possible in re- districting. The Black Belt is a collection of majority- Black counties that runs through the middle of Ala-bama. The Black voters in th e Black Belt share a rural geography, concentrated poverty, unequal access to government services, and lack of adequate healthcare. 12. Medicaid expansion is an economic interest that connects Black voters in the Black Belt and else- where in Alabama. It is estimated that there are over 300,000 total population in Alabama who do not have health care because Medicaid has not been expanded. Those who do not have affordable healthcare, are dis- proportionately African-American. Currently, Terri Sewell is the only Congressional representative advo-cating for Medicaid expansion. 13. Criminal justice reform is another issue that ties Black voters together. African-Americans are in- carcerated more than any othe r race, based on percent- age, and receive harsher sentences. With additional representation in Congress, Black voters in Alabama could exert more political pressure on the federal and state governments to develop a fairer criminal justice system. Currently, Representative Sewell is the only representative from the state that understands there is a problem. 14. Currently, Representative Sewell is the only one representative from the state giving voice to the issue that the Black Belt and the other Black JA286 communities in Alabama need more economic oppor- tunity and funding. 15. Moreover, Black Alabamians continue to face higher rates of infection and death from COVID-19 due to disparities in access to healthcare and other forms of structural inequality. 16. None of the representatives, besides Repre- sentative Sewell, voted fo r the John Lewis Advance- ment Act of 2021 that would improve voting opportunities for African-Am ericans and other minori- ties. I declare under penalty of perjury that the forego- ing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, in-formation, and belief.

I am a resident of Mobile, Alabama and I am registered voter in the City of Mobile, Alabama. I thus reside and vote in elections for U.S. Congressional Dis- trict 1. 2. I identify as Black or African-American. 3. I was born and raised in Mobile, Alabama which has allowed me to have a vested interest in the city and the state that I call home. 4. I earned my Bachelor's Degree from the United States Military at We st Point. Following that, I served on active duty for 6 years. While attending col-lege and serving on active duty, I lived in 5 different states and was deployed to the Middle East. I always remained a resident of Alabama and continued to vote JA288 in Alabama. Upon returning to Alabama, I immedi- ately noticed the lack of representation in many areas of leadership and elected position in particularly at the Congressional Level. 5. For several years, I have been actively in en- gaged in Voter Outreach where I have focused on edu-cating voters in my local community about the importance of participating in every election, helping with registering Alabamians to vote, and assisting with the mobilizing voters by providing those without transportation with the means to access the polls to vote on election day. 6. For the past 6 months, I have participated in the CROWD (Community Redistricting Organizations Working for Democracy) Fellow ship sponsored by the Southern Coalition of Social Justice, where I am as- signed to Lower Alabama whic h consists of counties in Congressional District 1. The redistricting work that I do is centered around educating the community on the process, how it impacts them , and why they should be actively involved in the process. 7. I, along with other Black people in both the City of Mobile and Mobile County, can trace our family roots back to the Black Belt areas of Alabama such as Montgomery County, Dallas County, Lowndes County, Wilcox County and other counties in the area. 8. With many Black people in the Mobile area having family ties to the Black Belt, it is a clear indi- cation that both areas are a community of interest and should be kept whole in one district. Black people in JA289 Mobile and Black people in the Black Belt share his- tory and similar struggles when it comes to combating adversity and fighting inequality in the state of Ala- bama. 9. The issues of education, healthcare, and the equitably distribution of infrastructure have been dev-astating to the Black communities residing in the Black Belt and Mobile. All of this, in addition to not being able to elect someone who will fight for the things that Black people in the Black Belt and Mobile find im- portant, results in the demographic that I belong to be- ing helpless and disempowered. 10. I spoke at the public hearing that the State Reapportionment Committee held in Mobile in Sep-tember 2021. My comments were about the packing and diluting of the Black vote in the Congressional District 7 and the need for an effort to be made for a second majoring minority Congressional District. 11. I virtually attended about twenty other pub- lic hearings that were held around the state and heard the same concerns mentioned by numerous other Black Alabamians. We made our issues known to the Committee leaders to no avail. Having a second Con- gressional District where a Black candidate of choice could be elected would allow for proper representation of what the demographics of Alabama truly look like. It will give a voice and hope to a group of people who have always had to fight for their voice to be heard.

I am a resident of Montgomery, Alabama and I am registered voter in the City of Montgomery. I thus reside and vote in elections for U.S. Congressional Dis- trict 7. 2. I identify as Black or African-American. 3. I grew up in Birmingham and Montgomery, Alabama. While in Birmingham, I lived in the College Hills neighborhood, which is located across the street from Birmingham-Southern College. While in Mont-gomery, I primarily lived in predominately African- American communities located in the downtown and southwestern areas of the city, particularly Centennial Hill, Rosa Parks Combined Communities, Haardt Es- tates, and South Hull. Over my lifetime, these areas JA292 have been associated with Congressional Districts 2 and 7. 4. I am the Executive Director of Alabama For- ward. Alabama Forward is a state-based 501(c)(3) civic engagement coordinating table committed to advanc- ing movement towards greater freedom and progres-sive, solution-oriented policy among a diverse coalition of Alabama-based partner orga nizations, so that every Alabamian can engage in the democratic process. In pursuit of this mission Alabama Forward prioritizes race and gender equity to engage every Alabamian in all aspects of our democracy. 5. The vision of the Alabama Forward 501(c)3 Network is to boost civic and political participation through collaborative voter engagement and election reform efforts while building th e capacity of participat- ing organizations to more effectively communicate about and engage in their work. Alabama Forward also prioritizes supporting compelling emerging leaders and organizations who have not historically received more traditional forms of support. 6. The Black community di spersed throughout Montgomery is a community of interest. While segre- gation and redlining policies initially concentrated the bulk of Montgomery's Black communities downtown, and immediately north, west, and south of there, as economic and residential opportunities have become more accessible, Black residents have settled in every zip code associated with Montgomery. Today, in addi- tion to West and North Montgomery neighborhoods JA293 that have been predominately Black for all their exist- ence, there are large pools of Black residents dispersed throughout the city in non-contiguous locations. 7. Black Montgomerians are often deeply con- nected to many of the military, government, educa- tional, civic, and cultural institutions located in inner-city Montgomery, particularly in the downtown area. Black families gather at the downtown Crampton Bowl for Friday Night football, assorted sports champion-ships, and multi-generational tailgating prior to big games. This community of interest educates their chil- dren at Valiant Cross Academy, a private Christian boy's academy located directl y across the street from the Alabama Supreme Court and state appellate courts. Black Montgomerians have multigenerational and diverse ties to Alabama State University (\"ASU\") an HBCU, where they work, attend school, send their children to the Headstart and prekindergarten pro-grams at Zeilia Stephens Early Childhood Center, en- joy football classics, and utilize the Dunn-Oliver Acadome and other campus venues for assorted cul-tural events including concerts, fraternity/sorority ga- las, high-school graduations, theater, and hosting notable public speakers. Social service providers and community development agencies pivotal to many Black Montgomery families are located in the down- town area, including the Community Action Agency that coordinates the Headstart programs located throughout the city; the Montgomery Public School Board offices; municipal government offices. Down-town Montgomery and the immediately adjacent areas JA294 also feature some of Montgo mery's oldest and most vi- brant Black faith communities, including Pilgrim Rest Baptist, First Avenue Baptist Church, Freewill Baptist Church, Dexter Avenue Baptist, St. John's AME Church, and Resurrection Catholic Church. Immedi- ately west and east of downtown are Gunter and Max- well Air Force Base where kids like me chose to serve their country in service of a brighter future for their country and themselves. These military installations provide considerable employment, educational, and recreational opportunities to Montgomery's Black ser- vicemembers and civilians. 8. In addition, downtown Montgomery also fea- tures numerous civil rights museums and institutions, including the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Legacy Center and Parsonage, the Rosa Parks Museum and Library, the EJI Legacy Museum, and the National Memorial for Peace and Justice. These sites provide historical information that is important to the identi- ties of Black Montgomerians and many family reun- ions organized by Black re sidents routinely feature trips to these sites. These sites recognize the profound consequences for both Blac k and white people of chat- tel slavery, racial terror lynchings, and racial segrega-tion. Irrespective of what part of town people are sleeping in Montgomery, these are the places where the majority of Black residents are educating their children, worshiping, working, recreating, and seeking cultural enrichment. 9. When I was a child, Representative Earl Hil- lard became the first Black congressperson to JA295 represent an Alabama district since Reconstruction and I recognized his importance in the creation of Dis- trict 7. The subsequent election of Representative Ar- tur Davis was also impactful due to his unique staff of diverse, passionate, and inspiring younger people. 10. I've experienced an intimate bond between Black communities in Montgomery and those based throughout the Black Belt. My first exposure to this connection was my own family. Our family routinely returned to our family cemetery in Lowndes County as a way of maintaining our connection to our origins. My wife and I chose to get married in the Lowndes County Courthouse due to our sense of cultural connection to this area. Our relationship with Lowndes County is not unique. Most Black families in Montgomery who are originally from this area have similar stories. 11. There are also civil rights and advocacy con- nections between Montgomery and the rural Black Belt communities. There are generations of connec- tions between communities in Dallas, Wilcox, Hale, Greene, Choctaw, Lowndes, Marengo, and Perry coun- ties; and institutions in Montgomery. For example, the Federation of Childcare Centers of Alabama was head-quartered in Montgomery, but founded by childcare center program leaders based throughout the Black Belt; and the connections between civil rights advo-cates in Dallas, Wilcox, and Hale counties and Black churches based in Montgomery. 12. Montgomery's demographics are also shaped by the same legacy of plant ation slavery that shapes JA296 the rural Black Belt. Black communities in the Black Belt have all experienced uniquely high rates of pov- erty, and poor health outcomes. These communities have relied on similar cultural and religious institu-tions for inspiration and resiliency. For many, Alabama State University has served as a multigenerational transition space for people em erging from Black fami- lies in the Black Belt who are interested in gaining skills and overcoming historic barriers. 13. In August and September of 2021, I partici- pated in several media forums with the League of Women Voters to discuss redistricting. 14. As Executive Director of Alabama Forward, I participated in bi-weekly briefing on the redistricting process beginning on April 30, 2021 to discuss public outreach and education around redistricting. 15. Between September 1 and 16, long before the Committee released any draft maps or proposals, the Legislative Reapportionment Office held 28 public hearings across the state. All but one hearing - held at 6:00 pm at the Statehouse in Montgomery - was held between the normal workday hours of 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, i.e., times when the ge neral public was least able to attend. 16. Khadidah Stone and I submitted email testi- mony to the Reapportionment committee on Thursday, September 16, 2021, the last Thursday of the hearings. 17. After submitting a reque st for a public hear- ing to the Senate Finance and Taxation General Fund JA297 Committee, I arrived to testify before that committee when it met on Tuesday, November 2, but they were not taking public testimony. 18. On October 29, 2021, the Alabama House State Government Committee met to discuss the Re- apportionment Committee's proposed districting plan for Alabama's U.S. House delegation. 19. During the hearing on the bill, I asked Rep- resentative Chris Pringle whether the Reapportion- ment Committee conducted racial polarization studies on any of the maps. Representative Chris Pringle said \"some of the districts that we were concerned about,\" but that they \"were still working on it.\" 20. In November, I testified in person at the House hearing on how the Committee assessed and utilized the feedback from the public listening ses-sions. I asked if the Committee considered community maps and when the public co uld receive the results of the RPV research. 21. When I asked whether the Committee lacked sufficient data to determine whether the map they in- troduced would violate federal law, Representative Pringle did not answer. 22. Alabama's 2021 special redistricting legisla- tive session began on October 28, 2021. By November 3, 2021, bills redistricting the Alabama U.S. Congres-sional map, Alabama Senate map and Alabama House of Representatives map were passed by both houses of JA298 the Alabama legislature and sent to Governor Kay Ivey's office for approval and signing. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge, infor- mation, and belief.

MERRILL Case No.: 2:21-cv-012921 SUPPLEMENTARY DECLARATION OF JOSEPH BAGLEY, PHD REBUTTAL OF REPORT OF THOMAS M. BRYAN (Filed Dec. 21, 2021) Thomas M. Bryan asserts in his report for the de- fendants that Mobile and Baldwin Counties consti- tute an inseparable community of interest (\"COI\") and that splitt ing these counties, as in the Milligan plaintiffs' proposed plan , would \"cause the most harm\" among county splits in said plan. Mr. Bryan also alludes to the Black Be lt region of the state but does not explain the historic al, demographic, or socio- economic characteri stics of the region. In my opinion, the Bryan report fails to describe the Black commu- nity and the Black Belt and its close relationship to the Black people of Mobile. The Black Belt is a region that stretches across America's Deep South, from South Carolina to Texas. It is named for its rich blac k soil. Though the majority of the American Black Belt's inhabitants are also Black people, the descendants of the enslaved who were forced to work that land before and during the Civil War. The Alabama Black Belt extends, roughly, from Russell and Barbour Counties in East Alabama, through Montgomery County, to an expanding area JA300 covering Pickens County to Washington County on the Mississippi line. As Native Americans were gradually and forcibly removed from the lands west of the Ocmulgee River in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, white settlers realized that the Black B elt's soil, and the Deep South's climate, were perf ect for growing long-staple cotton. At the same time, the invention of the cotton gin and the beginnings of industrialization increased demand for that crop, and a decline in the tobacco mar- ket created a \"surplus\" of enslaved Black people in the older plantation areas of the Tidewater of Virginia and North Carolina. White settlers began to flood into the state of Ala- bama when most of the remaining Creek Indians were forced out via the Indian Removal Act of 1830. By then, the United States government had banned the impor-tation of slaves from abroad, so many settlers brought enslaved Black people with them from the older plan- tation areas of the Upper South. Others purchased them from slave markets in Montgomery, Mobile, Jack- son, and other cities. Am erican chattel slavery ex- panded dramatically between that time and the Civil War, giving rise to the \"Cotton Kingdom\" of the ante- bellum era when cotton was America's most valuable export and enslaved Black people were its most valua-ble commodity. The Black Belt of Alabama became home to not only the wealthiest white plantation own- ers in the state, but to some of the wealthiest individ- uals in the young nation, some of whom held hundreds of people in bondage. JA301 When the 13th Amendment brought an end to chattel slavery, land was never systematically redis- tributed from white landowners and given to newly freed Black people. Formerly enslaved Black people be-came landless tenant farmers, beholden to their former masters. And when Alabama replaced its constitution in 1875 and again in 1901, it was the \"Bourbon redeem-ers\" of the Black Belt region, hyper-wealthy white landowners, who pushed hardest for a document that would protect white supremacy. Black people were the overwhelming majority in most areas. The Black Belt's white landowners feared that allowing Black people to vote freely would lead to land reform and their political and financial ruin. Thus, they lobbied for protections against white property tax d ollars for Black education and for the total disenfranchi sement of Black citizens. When the nonviolent movement for civil rights reached its peak in the mi d-1950s, it was the Black Belt where Black activists faced the most formidable reprisals - violent and economic. The Black Belt was also the seedbed of both th e Ku Klux Klan and the Cit- izens' Council in the state. The Citizens' Councils en- sured that any Black people engaged in civil rights activism received \"the pressure,\" meaning they would be fired by white employers, evicted by white landown- ers, denied credit by white bankers, etc. 1 \"Bloody Sun- day\" occurred in the Black Belt city of Selma, and the related murder of Viola Liuzzo occurred in nearby 1 Joseph Bagley, The Politics of White Rights: Race, Justice, and Integrating Alabama's Schools (Athens: University of Geor- gia Press, 2018). JA302 Lowndes County, dubbed \"Bloody Lowndes\" for the vi- olence meted out against voting rights protestors.2 White people fled public schools in the Black Belt ra- ther than integrate and even fled some cities entirely rather than share local governmental power. 3 The Black Belt was also the site of Black citizens' efforts to organize and to seek access to the franchise and to equal educational opportunity. When the Na- tional Association for the Advancement of Colored Peo- ple encouraged local branches to petition school boards to address the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Ed- ucation decision in 1955, Blac k people in Butler, Rus- sell, Bullock, and Dallas Co unties were among those to answer the call (Black activists in Mobile did the same). The Lowndes County Freedom Association was founded in 1965 and the National Democratic Party of Alabama was formed soon thereafter with both inde- pendent focused on running Black candidates in elec- tions in the Black Belt. 4 White backlash to Black ac tivism took the form of violence and economic reprisa ls, which contributed to Black Alabamians' migration from the Black Belt to Mobile and elsewhere as early as the end of the Civil 2 Hasan Kwame Jeffries, Bloody Lowndes: Civil Rights and Black Power in Alabama's Black Belt (New York: New York Uni- versity Press, 2010); James P.

JA303 War. This migration of Bl ack people from the Black Belt to Mobile continued through the end of the Nine- teenth Century and into the Twentieth Century. The historian Wayne Flynt has described a \"mas- sive hemorrhaging of people,\" mostly Black people, from the Black Belt, in th e early Twentieth Century. As Flynt explains, \"These internal migrants generally headed for cities.\" This wo uld include Black people who left the Black Belt for Mobile in significant numbers during the Great Depression , when white landowners refused to pass down federal aid to their sharecropping tenant farmers. In the second half of the Twentieth Century, consolidation of land, mechanization, and the rise of the Sunbelt generated, in Flynt's words, \"a hem- orrhaging of people [from th e Black Belt] even more severe\" than the previous one. Again, Black people left the Black Belt for Mobile. By the end of the century, more Black people in Alabama lived in cities than in rural areas. Many Black families in Mobile are Black Belt migrants or the descendants thereof. 5 As the political scientist Richard Pride writes of Mobile, \"Its roots followed the rivers north into the heart of the black belt . . . where cotton and timber grew abundantly, and planters, rednecks, and blacks marked all the society that people acknowledged.\" Pride continues, \"The city had its face turned toward 5 Wayne Flynt, Alabama in the Twentieth Century (Tusca- loosa: University of Alabama Press, 2004), pp. 115, 143, 177. JA304 the world, but it nevertheless grew out of the Old South.\"6 White flight accelerated significantly in Mobile when the city's long-running school desegregation case finally yielded positive results for Black plaintiffs in the early 1970s, at the same time that Black Belt pub-lic school systems were expe riencing similar backlash and flight. 7 As in the Black Belt , white flight has left most public schools east of 1-65 in Mobile overwhelm- ingly Black. The Black communities of Mobile and the Black Belt share significant historic, demographic, and socioeconomic interests. I am aware that the State Board of Education (\"SBOE\") elects eight-membe rs from single-member districts, including two majority Black districts. I am also aware that the parties in this case have agreed that, \"[i]n each election si nce 2011, a Black Democrat won a majority of Black voters and the election in Dis- tricts 4 and 5 of the SBOE\" and that \"District 5 of the SBOE Plan connects the City of Mobile to the Black Belt Counties.\" 8 The fact that most Black voters in SBOE District 5 vote for the same candidates and the 6 Richard Pride, The Political Use of Racial Narratives: School Desegregation in Mobile, Alabama, 1954-1997 (Cham- paign: Illinois Pr ess, 2002); Kirkland, \"Pink Sheets and Black Ballots: Po litics and Civil Rights in Mo- bile, Alabama, 1945-1985,\" M.A. Thesis (University of South Ala-bama, 2009). 7 Davis v.

Merrill, Dec. 7, 2021. JA305 State Legislature's decision to place the Black commu- nities in the City of Mobile and the Black Belt in the same SBOE district are co nsistent with my conclu- sions here. In his analysis of Mobile and Baldwin Counties, Mr. Bryan relies exclusively upon the previous testi-mony of U.S. Congressional Representative Bradley Byrne and former Representative Jo Bonner, two white men elected from the overwhelmingly white 1st Dis-trict who have asserted that Mobile and Baldwin form a sensible COI. But the population of the Mobile County east of Interstate 65 is overwhelming Black and shares little today with the rest of the metropoli- tan area, which is predominat ely white. And to the ex- tent that western Baldwin County shares economic interest with the city, it is because safely white com- munities like Fairhope, Spanish Fort, and Daphne be- came white flight destination s when courts called for compulsory school desegreg ation and white residents fled from the possibility of their kids attending major- ity Black Williamson High and Vigor High or a sub-stantially Black Murphy High. 9 The remaining areas of Baldwin County are either sparsely populated or are Gulf Coast beach tourist destinations that have little 9 Bagley, The Politics of White Rights ; Brian Duke, \"The Strange Career of Birdie Mae Davis: A History of a School Deseg-regation Lawsuit in Mobile, Alabama, 1963-1997,\" M.A. Thesis, Auburn University (2009).

JA307 Response to Report of Thomas Bryan Moon Duchin Professor of Mathematics, Tufts University Collaborating Faculty in Race, Colonialism, and Diaspora Studies Senior Fellow, Tisch College of Civic Life December 20, 2021 1 Background and assignment I am a Professor of Math ematics and a Senior Fellow in the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University. I have previously submitted an expert re- port in the current case and have been asked by coun- sel to provide additional material providing my opinion on the report of Thomas Bryan, particularly focused on his discussion of compactness metrics and of racial cat- egories on the Census. 2 Compactness metrics Part 4(D) of the Thomas Br yan report (pages 29-30) co- vers the topic of compactness metrics. In that Part, four compactness metrics are presented: Polsby-Popper, Schwartzberg, Reock, and Convex Hull. 2.1 Erroneous calculation The Schwartzberg scores are calculated incorrectly in Mr. Bryan's report. Quoting the original 1966 paper where the score was proposed by Joseph Schwartzberg, 1 1 Joseph E. Schwartzberg, Reap portionment, Gerrymanders, and the Notion of Compactness, 50 Minn. L. Rev. 443, 452 (1966). JA308 For any given two dimensional area the most compact shape is a circle. No other geometric figure has as low a ratio between its perimeter and area. The relative compactness of any other figure may be determined by finding the ratio of its perimeter to the perimeter of a cir- cle of equal area. The ratio serves as an index of compactness. The index number of a circle is taken to be one. All other indices are higher and represent varying degrees of departure from perfect compactness. Thus, the index number of a perfect square is 1.13, of an equi- lateral triangle 1.29, and of a perfect five point star 1.95. As this makes clear, th e Schwartzberg score takes a minimum value of 1 (realized only for perfect circles); all other shapes have values above that. In the Thomas Bryan report, all districts are reported to have Schwartzberg scores less than one. Mr. Bryan supports his calculation by citing the website (fisherzachary. github.io/public/r-output.html) of an undergraduate student project, and includ ing screenshots from that project in his report. 2.2 Questionable combination In addition to reporting scores incorrectly, Mr. Bryan also performs an operation that violates best practices in statistics and mathematical modeling: he adds scores that are in different units to create a \"Total.\" Polsby-Popper scores are in dimensionless units that can be interpreted as a proportion of a certain circle's area; Reock scores are in proportion of a different cir- cle's area; Convex Hull scores are in percentage of a JA309 certain polygon's area. It is unclear how one might in- terpret their sum, as the standard practice in quanti- tative analysis would be to only compute sums and averages of scores in like units. The practice of summarizing multiple compact- ness scores of numerous districts in a single number is not just abstractly discouraged, but has a concrete im- pact: it serves to hide the fact that different compact- ness scores reward or penalize different kinds of features. This can mislead re aders into thinking that two plans are directly comparable when in fact one is stronger in some ways while the other is stronger in other ways. In a case like this, the appropriate conclu- sion would be that the compactness comparison is marked by tradeoffs. 3 Racial population categories Part 3 of the Thomas Bryan report (pages 9-13) dis- cusses Census Race Definitions, tallying population with categories that he calls \"Black Alone\" and \"All Black.\" Mr. Bryan writes on p.10 that \"the \"alone\" definition has been most defensible from a political science / Gingles 2 voting behavior perspective\"\u2014here, it is unclear what referenc es support his claim, from political science or any other scholarly or practitioner literature. As Mr. Bryan acknowledges, the ability to use mul- tiple categories to self-identify race in the Census is relatively recent. I note the Decennial Census treats Black as a checkbox, i.e., a yes/no question (see Figure 1). Thus, the Any-Part-Black definition (AKA \"All JA310 Black\") can be very simply described: it contains all residents who, when presented with the Yes-or-No ques- tion about whether they are Black, answered Yes . Figure 1: The race question on the Decennial Census form in 2010. I further note that Plan A, the first alternative plan presented in my report of December 10, has two majority-Black districts by any definition of Black that is plausibly used for VRA purposes: Any-Part-Black VAP, Black-Alone VAP, or Black Citizen VAP.2 2 As explained in the supplemental material to my initial re- port, the BCVAP is estimated by using a special tabulation of the American Community Survey to ca lculate the citizenship rate for Black residents in the tract to which each block belongs, then ap-plying that rate to the BVAP, in CD2 and CD7 in Plan A Future inquiry via voter registration There is another source that could be useful to support the question of Black self-identification in Alabama: the voter registration file, in which citizens are asked to identify their race with a single choice. Counsel is currently attempting to secure a geocoded voter regis- tration file. If I am provided with that resource in the near future, I hope to provide a supplemental report with the corresponding analysis. I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.

JOHN H. MERRILL, in his official capacity as Alabama Secretary of State, Defendant. Case No. 2:21-cv-751-WKW-JTA COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (Filed Nov. 4, 2021) Plaintiffs Marcus Caster, LaKeisha Chestnut, Bobby Lee DuBose, Benjamin Jones, Rodney Allen Love, Manasseh Powell, Ronald Smith, and Wendell Thomas file this Complaint for Declaratory and In- junctive Relief against Defe ndant John H. Merrill in his official capacity as the Alabama Secretary of State, and allege as follows: 1. Plaintiffs bring this voting rights action to challenge HB 1 (2021 Second Special Session), which establishes new congressional districts for Alabama JA313 based on the 2020 Census, on the grounds that it vio- lates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301, because it strategically cracks and packs Alabama's Black communities, diluting Black voting strength and confining Black voting power to one ma- jority-Black district. 2. Between 2010 and 2020, Alabama's Black pop- ulation grew 6.5 percent. Du ring the same period, the state's white population f ell by 1.7 percent, meaning majority-Black Alabamians dr ove all of Alabama's pop- ulation growth over the last decade. And yet the state's newly enacted congressional redistricting plan further entrenches the state's white majority by creating only a single majority-Black district in the state, despite Al- abama's Black population b eing sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to support two majority- Black congressional districts. Indeed, while Black Ala- bamians now compose more than 27 percent of the state's population and nearly 26 percent of the state's voting age population, they have the opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice in just one out of seven districts. 3. HB 1 is just the most recent enactment in Al- abama's long history of discriminatory voting laws. Black Alabamians have long suffered from voting dis- crimination and vote dilution and as a result have en-dured systemic neglect of the issues and needs that deeply affect their community. 4. The state's newly enacted congressional redis- tricting plan deepens these issues creating majority-Black distri ct. HB 1 \"cracks\" Black between First, Second, and Third Congres- sional Districts, and \"packs\" Black voters into the Seventh Congressional Dis trict (\"CD 7\") despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014the fact that the Black population in these districts is su fficiently numerous and geo- graphically compact to form a majority of the voting age population in a second district. Additionally, there is widespread racially polarized voting in Alabama, and when considered against the totality of the circum-stances, the enacted plan's failure to create two major- ity-Black districts dilutes the Black vote in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 5. Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek an order (1) de- claring that HB 1 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act; (2) enjoining Defendant from conducting future elections under HB 1; (3) ordering a congres- sional redistricting plan that includes two majority-Black congressional district s; and (4) providing any such additional relief as is appropriate. JURISDICTION AND VENUE 6. Plaintiffs bring this action under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301. 7. This Court has original jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343 because the matters in controversy arise under the laws of the United States and involve the assertion of deprivation, un der color of state law, of rights under federal law.

Plaintiffs are citizens of the United States and are registered to vote in Alabama. 12. Plaintiff Marcus Caster is a Black Citizen of the United States and of the state of Alabama, a regis- tered voter, and a resident of Washington County in the First Congressional District (\"CD 1\"). CD 1 is a major- ity-white district in which Bl ack voters like Mr. Caster do not have an opportunity to elect their preferred can-didates. An additional majority-Black district could be drawn incorporating all or some of Washington County, including Mr. Caster's residence. 13. Plaintiff LaKeisha Chestnut is a Black citi- zen of the United States and of the state of Alabama, a registered voter, and a resident of Mobile County in CD 1 in the enacted plan. CD 1 is a majority-white district in which Black voters like Ms. Chestnut do not have an opportunity to elect their preferred candidates. An JA316 additional majority-Black district could be drawn in- corporating all or some of Mobile County, including Ms. Chestnut's residence. 14. Plaintiff Bobby DuBose is a Black citizen of the United States and of the state of Alabama, a regis- tered voter, and a resident of Jefferson County in CD 7 in the enacted plan, in which Black voters like Mr. DuBose are packed, preventing the creation of an ad- ditional majority-Black district as required by the Vot-ing Rights Act. 15. Plaintiff Benjamin Jones is a Black Citizen of the United States and of the state of Alabama, a regis- tered voter, and a resident of Montgomery County in the Second Congressional District (\"CD 2\"). CD 2 is a majority-white district in wh ich Black voters like Mr. Jones do not have an opportunity to elect their pre- ferred candidates. An additional majority-Black dis-trict could be drawn incorp orating all or some of Montgomery County, including Mr. Jones's residence. 16. Plaintiff Rodney Love is a Black citizen of the United States and of the st ate of Alabama, a registered voter, and a resident of Jeffe rson County in CD 7 in the enacted plan, in which Black voters like Mr. Love are packed, preventing the creat ion of an additional major- ity-Black district as required by the Voting Rights Act. 17. Plaintiff Manasseh Powell is a Black citizen of the United States and of the state of Alabama, a reg- istered voter, and a resident of Montgomery County in CD 2. CD 2 is a majority-wh ite district in which Black voters like Mr. Powell do not have an opportunity to JA317 elect their preferred candidates. An additional major- ity-Black district could be drawn incorporating all or some of Montgomery. County, including Mr. Powell's residence. 18. Plaintiff Ronald Smith is a Black citizen of the United States and of the state of Alabama, a regis-tered voter, and a resident of Bullock County in CD 2. CD 2 is a majority-white dis trict in which Black voters like Mr. Smith do not have an opportunity to elect their preferred candidates. An addi tional majority-Black dis- trict could be drawn incorporating all or some of Bull- ock County, including Mr. Smith's residence. 19. Plaintiff Wendell Thomas is a Black citizen of the United States and of the state of Alabama, a regis-tered voter, and a resident of Montgomery County in CD 2 in the enacted plan. CD 2 is a majority-white dis- trict in which Black voters like Mr. Thomas do not have an opportunity to elect their preferred candidates. An additional majority-Black district could be drawn in- corporating all or some of Montgomery County, includ-ing Mr. Thomas's residence. 20. Defendant John H. Merrill is sued in his offi- cial capacity as the Secretary of State of Alabama. The Secretary of State is Alabama's chief election officer. Ala. Code \u00a7 17-1-3(a). In that capacity, he is responsible for providing uniform guidance for election activities and implementing the state's election laws and regu- lations, including HB 1. Id. JA318 LEGAL BACKGROUND 21. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301(a), prohibits any \"stand ard, practice, or proce- dure\" that \"results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on ac- count of race or color[.]\" Thus, in addition to prohibit-ing practices that deny outright the exercise of the right to vote, Section 2 prohibits vote dilution. A viola- tion of Section 2 is establis hed if it is shown that \"the political processes leading to nomination or election\" in the jurisdiction \"are not equally open to participation by [majority-Black voters] in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the politic al process and to elect rep- resentatives of their choice.\" 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301(b). 22. The dilution of voting strength \"may be caused by the dispersal of [members of a racial or eth-nic group] into districts in which they constitute an in- effective minority of voters or from the concentration of [members of that group] into districts where they constitute an excessive majority.\" Thornburg v. Gin- gles, 478 U.S. 30, 46 n.11 (1986). 23. In Thornburg v. Gingles , the United States Supreme Court identified three necessary precondi- tions (the \" Gingles preconditions\") for a claim of vote dilution under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act: (1) the minority group must be \"sufficiently large and ge- ographically compact to constitute a majority in a sin-gle-member district\"; (2) th e minority group must be \"politically cohesive\"; and (3) the majority must vote JA319 \"sufficiently as a bloc to enab le it . . . usually to defeat the minority's preferred c andidate.\" 478 U.S. at 50-51. 24. Once all three preconditions are established, the statute directs courts to consider whether, under the totality of the circumstances, members of a racial group have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301(b). The Senate Report on the 1982 amend-ments to the Voting Rights Act identifies several non- exclusive factors that courts should consider when de- termining if, under the totality of the circumstances in a jurisdiction, the operation of the electoral device be- ing challenged results in a violation of Section 2. 25. These Senate factors include: (1) the history of official voting-related dis crimination in the state or political subdivision; (2) the extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is ra- cially polarized; (3) the ex tent to which the state or political subdivision has used voting practices or pro-cedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group, such as un- usually large election districts, majority-vote require-ments, and prohibitions against bullet-voting; (4) the exclusion of members of the minority group from can- didate slating processes; (5) the extent to which minor- ity group members 'bear the effects of discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process; (6) the us e of overt or subtle racial appeals in political campaigns; and (7) the extent to JA320 which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction. 26. The Senate Report itself and the cases inter- preting it have made clear that \"there is no require- ment that any particular number of factors be proved, or that a majority of them point one way or the other.\" United ting S. Rep. No. 97417, at 29 (1982)); see also id. at 1566 (\"The statute explic- itly calls for a 'totality-of-the circumstances' approach and the Senate Report indicates that no particular fac- tor is an indispensable element of a dilution claim.\"). FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS A. Alabama's 2021 Re districting Process 27. The enacted plan is the product of a muddled and harried process, which left legislators little time to meaningfully consider alternative proposals and nec-essary redistricting criteria. 28. On October 26, 2021, two days before the Legislature took up redistricting in a special session, the Alabama Legislative Committee on Reapportion- ment held a hearing to approve plan proposals to be presented to the full Legislature. Committee members, however, were not sent the proposed plans until the night before the hearing, forcing them to vote and de-bate maps they had almost no time to consider. 29. It quickly became apparent that no commit- tee member understood why the maps were drawn the JA321 way they were. The chair of the committee explained that the proposed maps were drawn not by, or in coor- dination with, committee members but rather were the product of committee staff and the committee's attor-ney. It was also revealed that the proposed maps were not subjected to functional or racial polarization anal- yses, tests critical to determining whether a plan com-plies with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 30. Many committee members found these sub- stantive and procedural flaws fatal to the committee's work and implored the chair to postpone approval of the maps until members could meaningfully consider the proposals and to allow time to determine whether the maps complied with the Constitution and the Vot- ing Rights Act. Members were emphatic that to do oth-erwise would make a mockery of the committee's work and leave them unable to intelligently explain the ad- vantages or disadvantages of the ultimately approved proposals to the full legislature. 31. These objections were overruled or voted down along party lines by the Republican-led commit- tee. In the end, each proposal, including the congres- sional plan that formed the basis of the enacted map, were approved only by Republican committee mem- bers who had fewer than 24 hours to consider the pro- posals for which they voted. 32. The Legislature's special session was no less perfunctory. The Legislature began formally consider-ing map proposals on October 28, 2021. By November 1, 2021, the congressional map had passed the House. JA322 And by, November 3, 2021, it was approved by the sen- ate. Throughout the session, Democratic legislators criticized the law's passage as irreparably flawed, leav- ing legislators little time to consider the map and in the dark as to the data and process that led to the map's drawing. Moreover, many legislators lamented the enacted map's failure to create a second majority-Black district and emphasized the state's continued practice of stymying Black representation within the state. 33. Governor Kay Ivey signed HB 1 into law on November 4, 2021. B. The 2021 Congressional Redistricting Plan 34. The enacted congressional plan contains only a single majority-Black district\u2014CD 7\u2014despite Black Alabamians composing over 27 percent of the state's population. CD 7 is heavily Black and includes nearly 30% of Alabama's Black population. 1 35. Enacted CD 7 includes Jefferson, Tuscaloosa, Pickens, Greene, Sumter, Hale, Perry, Dallas, Montgom- ery, Lowndes, Wilcox, Marengo, Choctaw, and Clarke Counties. 1 For purposes of this Compla int, \"Black\" represents any person who selected \"Black or African Am.\" on the Census form, regardless of whether th ey also selected anot her race, and regard- less of whether they indicated they were of \"Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin.\" JA323 36. HB 1 \"cracks\" Black voters in surrounding districts CDs 1, 2, and 3 and \"packs\" Black voters into CD 7, preventing the emergence of a second congres- sional district in which Blac k voters would have an op- portunity to elect their candidates of choice. 37. This is all despite the state's rising Black population. Between 2010 and 2020, Alabama's popu- lation increased from 4,779,736 to 5,024,279, a 5.1 per- cent increase. Thirty-four percent of that population increase is attributable to Black residents. 38. By combining cracked Black populations in CDs 1, 2, and 3 and unpacking CD 7, the Alabama mapdrawers could have drawn two majority-Black dis- tricts, as required by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 39. Each of the three districts among which the Black population is significantly cracked\u2014CDs 1, 2, and 3\u2014includes at least one significant Black popula- tion center in an otherwise overwhelmingly white dis- trict. For example, CD 3 contains Macon County, which is home to the historically Black college Tuskegee Uni- versity and has a Black population of 80.4 percent. Similarly, CD 1 includes Mobile County, which has a Black population of 36.2 percent, and Monroe County, which has a Black population of 41.0 percent. Mont- gomery County, which has a Black population of 59.3 percent is split between CD s 2 and 7. The Black popu- lation in the eastern portion of Alabama is split in two by the border between CDs 2 and 3. 40. HB 1's cracking of the state's Black popula- tion is exemplified by th e splitting of the state's JA324 historical Black Belt. Located in the south-central re- gion' of Alabama, the Black Belt was originally named for its rich black soil, but ov er time came to be associ- ated with the slave labor that soil attracted. Today the Black Belt region refers to the state's counties with the largest Black populations. As Booker T. Washington ex- plained in 1901, the Black Belt was \"the part of the South where the slaves were most profitable, and con- sequently they were taken there in the largest num- bers.\" 41. According to the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Alabama, the \"traditional counties\" of the Alabama Black Belt in- clude Sumter, Choctaw, Greene, Hale, Marengo, Perry, Dallas, Wilcox, Lowndes, Butler, Crenshaw, Montgom-ery, Macon, Bullock, Pike, Barbour, and Russell Coun- ties. The counties that surround the Black Belt, such as Washington, Mobile, Clarke, Escambia, and Monroe Counties, are also known for their large Black popula- tions. 42. In HB 1, the Black Belt and its surrounding counties are split among four congressional districts\u2014 CDs, 1, 2, 3, and 7. 43. Rather than crack and pa ck Black voters in these districts, a second majority-Black district could have been drawn in CD 2 in any number of configura- tions. As just one example, CD 2 could be drawn to in- clude all of Montgomery County and to encompass Black Belt counties in the western part of the state, ceding the state's southernmost counties to CD 1. This JA325 configuration would have resulted in two majority- Black districts, CDs 2 and 7, while adhering to each of the state's redistricting criteria. 44. Indeed, the Legislature could have reached this result by any number of variations on a similar configuration, suggesting t hat rather than embrace a natural second majority-Black district, the Legislature worked to avoid one. C. Racial Polarization in Alabama 45. Voting in Alabama is racially polarized. Black voters in Alabama are politically cohesive and overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates. The white majority in Alabama is also politically cohesive, overwhelmingly supports Republican candidates, and historically votes as a bloc to defeat Black voters' can-didates of choice. 46. The last time voters in CD 1 elected a Black candidate to represent them in Congress, for example, was during Reconstruction. Indeed, while about a quarter of the voting age population in CD 1 is Black, white Republicans have been continuously elected to represent CD 1 since 1965. 47. In 2020, exit polling showed that 89 percent of Black voters in Alabama supported President Biden in the presidential election while 77 percent of white Alabamians voted for former President Trump. 48. Federal courts have consistently found that voting in Alabama is and remains severely racially JA326 polarized. In Buskey v. Oliver , for example, the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Alabama con- cluded that the City of Montgomery, which is the county seat of Montgomery County in the Black Belt, is \"a city still polarized by race, with only white council members being elected from predominantly white council districts and with only black council members being elected from predominantly black council dis- tricts.\" 565 F. Supp. 1473, 1482 (M.D. Ala. 1983). Dallas County Commis- sion, 739 F.2d 1529, 1536 (11th Cir. 1984), the Eleventh Circuit found that racially polarized voting existed in Dallas County elections for the period from 1966 through 1978. On remand, th e U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama determined that vot-ing patterns in Dallas County remained polarized along racial lines between 1978 and 1986. United States v. Dallas Cty. Comm'n , 636 F. Supp. 704, 710 (S.D. Ala. 1986). 50. And in 2011, the Middle District of Alabama recognized \"[i]n an era when the degree of racially po- larized voting in the South is increasing, not decreas- ing, Alabama remains vulnerable to politicians setting an agenda that exploits racial differences.\" United States v. McGregor , 824 F. Supp. 2d 1339, 1347 (M.D. Ala. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Dillard v. Baldwin Cnty. Comm'n , (\"[B ]lack win County still suffer from . . . racially polarized voting and from historically depressed conditions, JA327 economically and socially.\") aff 'd , 376 F.3d 1260 (11th Cir. 2004). 51. The cause of the state's racial polarization can be found in its long hist ory of racial discrimination: \"Racial bloc voting by whites is attributable in part to past discrimination, and the past history of segrega-tion and discrimination affects the choices of voters at the polls.\" Brown v. Bd. of Sch. Comm'rs 542 , 706 F.2d 1103 (11th Cir. 1983), aff 'd 464 U.S. 1005 (1983). D. Alabama's History of Racial Discrimina- tion 52. In a region infamous for its racial discrimi- nation, Alabama stands out. After nearly a century of formal disenfranchisement, Reconstruction granted Black Alabamians the right to vote. Almost immedi-ately afterward, however, Alabama embarked on what would become a centuries-long program to ensure Black citizens could never exercise that right. At first manifesting in literacy test s and poll taxes, Alabama's effort to discriminate against Black voters morphed over time into white primar ies, and eventually into the vote dilution reflected in the map at issue in this liti- gation. 53. Consider first Alabama's 1901 constitutional convention. The state ratified voter restrictions such as literacy tests, employment and property requirements, JA328 and a cumulative poll tax, which formed a legal block- ade against the Black vote. 54. The state's intentions were obvious. The President of the constitutional convention, John B. Knox, explained that the purpose of the convention was \"to establish white supremacy in this State,\" as-serting that within the white man [is] an inherited capacity for government, which is wholly wanting in the Negro. Before the art of reading and writing was known, the ancestors of the Anglo-Saxon had established an orderly system of govern- ment . . . the Negro on the other hand, is de- scended from a race lowest in intelligence and moral perceptions of the races of men. 55. Delegates to the convention both understood and desired that these laws would restrict the Black vote. It was the judgment of one delegate that \"th[e] poll tax qualification is the most important provision\" in the proposed constitution because \"in the Black Belt and . . . in many counties in the state, there is a large percentage of those young Negroes who are coming of age that will be able to read and write, [and] therefore will be qualified under the provisions of this article\" to vote. \"The only safety valve,\" he continued, \"that is con-tained in this article, after 1903 for a large proportion of the Negroes in this Stat e is this Poll tax of $1.50.\" United States v. Alabama , 252 F. Supp. 95, 99 (M.D. Ala. 1966). Alabama \"want[ed] that poll tax to pile up so high that [Black voters] will never be able to vote JA329 again.\" Id. The State's poll tax would exist until 1966, when a federal court finally struck it down. Id. 56. At the same time that Alabama actively worked to disenfranchise Blac k voters, it strove to pro- tect the enfranchisement of white voters. For example, to avoid unintentionally suppressing white voters, the 1901 constitution provided \"g randfather clauses\" that exempted voters from the constitution's voter suppres- sion provisions if they could show, for example, a vague level of \"understanding\" of the U.S. Constitution or that they were veterans or descendants of veterans, re- quirements very few Black Alabamians at the time could meet. 57. The effect of the 1901 constitution on the Black vote was staggering. In 1900 there were approx- imately 181,000 registered Black male voters in Ala- bama. By 1903, there were 3,000. 58. For Alabama, even 3,000 Black voters were still too many. The state's voter suppression laws brought about one-party rule in Alabama, shifting the importance of the general elec tion to the primary. Re- alizing that excluding Blac k voters from primary con- tests would effectively eliminate the chance for Black voters to influence the outcome of any election, Ala- bama legislators seized the opportunity by inventing the all-white primary system. Alabama expressly ex- cluded Black voters from participating in primary elec- tions, cutting off Black Alabamians from any hope of political power. JA330 59. Alabama fiercely defended its right to disen- franchise its Black citizens in the face of federal inter- ference. Fearing that the United States Senate would pass a law eliminating the state's poll tax, the Alabama Legislature in 1942 congratulated its U.S. Senators on \"their magnificent fight against the measure now pending in Congress which is calculated to destroy our Poll Tax Law.\" Id. at 102. 60. Legal upsets, however, only emboldened Ala- bama. After the Supreme Court found the use of white- only primaries unconstitutional in Smith v. Allwright , 321 U.S. 649 (1944), Alabama ratified a new constitu-tional amendment that would require new voting reg- istrants to \"understand and explain,\" and read and write, an article of the U.S. Constitution. Like its pre-decessors, this voting measure was motivated by racial discrimination. One drafter of the amendment ex- plained that the \"understanding\" clause would give \"discretion to the Board of Registrars and enable them to prevent from registerin g those elements in our com- munity which have not yet fitted themselves for self-government.\" 61. A court ultimately concluded that the \"un- derstanding\" clause was unlawful, but Alabama quickly replaced it with a questionnaire that took ad- vantage of the state's racial disparity in education to bar Black voters from the polls. One academic ex- plained that even an \"honestly designed educational test\" would \"bar the ballot to the great mass of unedu-cated Negroes.\" JA331 62. The state's effort to disenfranchise Black voters extended to its electoral devices. For example, Alabama embraced at-large elections whenever it per- ceived a threat of meaningful Black voter participation to dilute the Black vote. Alabama also passed a bill eliminating \"single-shot\" voting, which had previously enabled \"a minority group to win some at-large seats if it concentrates its vote behind a limited number of can- didates and if the vote of the majority is divided among a number of candidates.\" City of Rome v. United States , 446 U.S. 156, 184 n.19 (1980), abrogated by Shelby Cnty. v. Holder , 570 U.S. 529 (2013). 63. Further, in a primitive form of gerrymander- ing that would portend the more sophisticated line drawing to come, the city of Tuskegee redrew its city limits in 1957 to oust Black residents and eliminate their ability to influence city council elections. This fla- grantly discriminatory gerrymander would be declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court three years later in Gomillion v. Lightfoot , 364 U.S. 339 (1960). 64. This period in the state's centuries-long ef- fort to disenfranchise Black voters culminated in 1965 on \"Bloody Sunday.\" On Ma rch 7, 1965, nonviolent ac- tivists began a march from Selma to Montgomery to protest Alabama's voter suppression laws and prac- tices. As the marchers crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge, Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark directed state troopers to attack the unarmed activists with billy clubs and tear gas. The country and world watched in horror. JA332 65. Bloody Sunday and the public outcry it pro- duced motivated Congress to pass the landmark Vot- ing Rights Act in August 1965. Because of the state's history of adopting and enforcing unconstitutional de-vices designed to disenfr anchise Black voters, Alabama was deemed a \"covered\" state undef the Voting Rights Act, requiring Alabama to submit changes to its elec-toral practices or procedures to the U.S. Department of Justice or to a Federal District Court for approval. 66. The Voting Rights Act was not the cure-all the country had hoped for: Alabama has remained in- corrigibly committed to voter suppression. 67. From the Act's passage in 1965 to 1982, when the Voting Rights Act was reauthorized, the Depart-ment of Justice was forced to send election observers to Alabama a staggering 107 times to prevent Alabama from restricting Black voters from accessing the polls. Between 1982 and 2006, the Department sent observ- ers to the state another 91 ti mes. In 1992, for example, the Department sent officials to Greensboro, Alabama after white election officials\u2014incensed by the election of the first Black officials to local office\u2014sought to pre- vent Black voters from entering polling places. All told, between 1965 and 2013 the Department blocked at least 100 of Alabama's proposed voting changes under the Voting Rights Act's preclearance process. See U.S. Dep't of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Voting Section, Voting Determinat ion Letters for Al abama, http://www. justice.gov/crt/records/vot/obiletters/stateletters.php? state=a1 (last updated May 18, 2020) (listing all JA333 objections imposed against Alabama under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act) 68. Over the nearly six decades since the Voting Rights Act was passed, Alabama has been sued dozens of times over its racially discriminatory voting practices. See, e.g., People First of Ala. v. Merrill , 467 F. Supp. 3d 1179 (N.D. Ala. 2020) (witness requirement for absentee ballots); Greater Birmingham Ministries v. Alabama , 161 F. Supp. 3d 1104 (N.D. Ala. 2016) (photo identification law); Ala. Legis. Black Caucus v. Alabama , 575 U.S. 254 (2015) (racial gerrymandering); S. Christian Leadership Conf of Ala. v. Sessions , 56 F.3d 1281 (11th Cir. 1995) (at-large system for electing trial judges); City of Pleasant Grove v. United States , 479 U.S. 462 (1987) (selective annexations); Hunter v. Un- derwood , 471 U.S. 222 (1985) (f elon disenfranchise- v. Graddick (Harris I) , 593 F. Supp. 128 (M.D. Ala. 1984) (appointment of disproportionately few Black poll officials); United States v. Alabama , 252 F. Supp. 95 (M.D. Ala. 1966) (discriminatory admin- istration of the poll tax); United States v. Logue , 344 F.2d 290 (5th Cir. 1965) (racial discrimination in voter registration); Sims v. Baggett , 247 F. Supp. 96 (M.D. Ala. 1965) (racial gerrymandering); United States v. Atkins , 323 F.2d 733 (5th Cir. 1963) (racial discrimina- tion in voter registration). 69. The Supreme Court's invalidation of Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder , 570 U.S. 529 (2013), left the state unchecked to con- tinue its legacy of racially discriminatory practices. The day after Shelby County was decided, Alabama JA334 announced that it would purs ue a strict voter ID law. Alabama then proceeded to close 31 offices providing driver's license services to make it more difficult for voters to obtain the necessary photo ID to satisfy the state's new law. An investigation by the Federal De- partment of Transportation concluded that \"African Americans residing in the Black Belt region of Ala-bama were disproportionately underserved by [the state's] driver licensing se rvices, causing a disparate and adverse impact on the basis of race.\" 70. What is briefly described here as Alabama's history of voter discriminat ion cannot possibly capture the state's centuries-long effo rts to maintain white su- premacy within its borders. Nevertheless, several fed- eral courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have acknowledged the state's history in official opinions which provide additional context. See, e.g., McGregor , 824 F. Supp. 2d at 1346 (\"The intersection of political strategy and purposeful racial prejudice is nothing new. Alabama has a lengthy and infamous history of racial discrimination in voting.\"); Hunter , 471 U.S. at 229 (\"[T]he Alabama Constitutional Convention of 1901 was part of a moveme nt that swept the post- Reconstruction South to disenfranchise blacks. . . . The delegates to the all-whit e convention were not se- cretive about their purpose.\"); Dillard v. Crenshaw Cnty. , 640 F. Supp. 1347, 1360 (M.D. Ala. 1986) (\"As the late Judge Richard T. Rives stated, 'from the Constitu- tional Convention of 1901 to the present, the State of Alabama has consistently devoted its official resources to maintaining white supremacy and a segregated JA335 society.' \") (quoting United. States v. Alabama , 252 F. Supp. at 101). E. Alabama's History of Unlawful Redistrict- ing 71. Alabama's practice of voter suppression has extended to its modern redistricting efforts. During the 1980 redistricting cycle, the Department of Justice rejected Alabama's proposed legislative redistricting plan because it reduced the number of majority-Black districts within the state. And it objected again to Ala- bama's revised map because it intentionally \"cracked\" Black voters in Black Belt counties. 72. The Department also intervened in Ala- bama's 1992 redistri cting plan for appe to \"crack\" majority-Black voting populations to dilute Black voting power. 73. During the 2010 redistricting cycle, Alabama packed the state's existing majority-Black legislative districts with many more Black voters. Of the 15,785 individuals added to Senate District 26, for example, only 36 were white. Ala. Legis. Black Caucus , 575 U.S. at 260. 74. The state's \"packing\" of Black Alabamians in House and Senate districts drew a lawsuit from the Al-abama Legislative Black Caucus and the Alabama Democratic Conference, who argued that Alabama's state legislative redistricting plans were racial gerry-manders that diluted the Black vote. After being JA336 reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama agreed with the plaintiffs, concluding that several state House and Senate districts were unconstitution-ally drawn on the basis of race. Ala. Legis. Black Cau- cus v. Alabama , 231 F. Supp. 3d 1026 (M.D. Ala. 2017). F. Ongoing Effects of Alabama's History of Discrimination 75. Black Alabamians lag behind their white counterparts on nearly every measure, including in ar- eas such as education, employment, income, and access to health care. For example, according to the most re-cent five-year American Community Survey, between 2015 and 2019, 27 percent of Black Alabamians were living below the poverty line, more than twice the num-ber of impoverished white Alabamians during the same period. And according to one report, white Ala- bamians lead their Black counterparts in bachelor's degrees by double-digits. Indeed, education outcomes for Black Alabamians are particularly dire. As of 2014, 43 school districts in Alabama were under some form of federal oversight as a re sult of continued segrega- tion, despite the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision 60 years ago. 76. Black Alabamians also lag behind economi- cally. Black incomes are substantially lower than those paid to their white counterparts, and Black Alabami- ans are unemployed within the state at much higher JA337 rates, too. Similar disparities exist in the areas of hous- ing, home ownership, and access to a vehicle. 77. Low-income voters face a number of hurdles to voter participation including working multiple jobs, working during polling place ho urs, lack of access to childcare, lack of access to transportation, and higher rates of illness and disability. All of these hurdles make it more difficult for poor and low-income voters to par- ticipate effectively in the political process. G. History of Racial Appeals in Political Campaigns 78. Political campaigns in Alabama have long re- lied on explicit and implicit racial appeals to stir vot- ers. 79. At the height of Jim Crow, Governor George Wallace famously ran on a platform of \"segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\" Sadly, such sentiments were not confined to that era. 80. In 2010, some Alabama state senators were recorded strategizing about suppressing Black voter turnout by keeping an issue important to Black Ala-bamians\u2014whether to legalize electronic bingo\u2014off the ballot. In these conversations, then-state Senator Scott Beason, then-state Representative Benjamin Lewis (now an appointed county judge), and other influen- tial members of the Alabama legislature are heard tar- geting Black voters for \"mockery and racist abuse.\" McGregor , 824 F. Supp. 2d at 1346. They referred to JA338 Blacks as \"Aborigines\" and \"Indians\" and predicted that if the ballot measure appeared on the ballot \"every black in this state will be bused to the polls . . . [e]very black, every illiterate woul d be bused on HUD financed buses.\" Id. at 1345 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A federal district court found that the state senators' efforts to depress Black voter turnout constituted an intentionally discriminatory \"scheme\" to \"maintain and strengthen white control of the polit- ical system,\" and that \"political exclusion through rac-ism remains a real and enduring problem in this State.\" Id. at 1347. 81. Still more, at a November 2015 rally for then- candidate Donald Trump in Birmingham, a peaceful Black Lives Matter protester was punched and kicked by a group of men yelling, \"Go home nigger,\" after the protester interrupted Trump's speech by shouting \"Black Lives Matter!\" The next day, referring to the beaten Black Lives Matter protester, then-candidate Trump stated, \"Maybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.\" 82. More recently, Roy Moore, who ran for U.S. Senate in 2017, stated at a revival in Jackson, Ala- bama, \"They started [to] create new rights in 1965, and today we've got a problem,\" an apparent reference to the Voting Rights Act. When asked to speak about the last time America was great, Moore stated, \"I think it was great at the time when families were united\u2014even though we had slavery\u2014they cared for one another. . . . Our families were strong, our country had a direction.\" JA339 H. Extent to Which Black Alabamians Have Been Elected to Public Office 83. As a consequence of Alabama's past history of voter suppression and racial discrimination, Black Alabamians have struggled to be elected to public of-fice in the state. 84. From Reconstruction until 1992, Alabama failed to elect a single Black representative to Con- gress. Although today 27.2 percent of Alabama's popu- lation is Black, not one statewide elected office is currently held by a Black Alabamian. And Alabama has never had a Black governor or U.S. senator. 85. It took the creation of the state's first major- ity-Black district through litigation\u2014CD 7\u2014before a Black Alabamian could win election to federal office. The citizens of CD 7 have elected a Black representa- tive in every election since 1992, and today CD 7 is rep- resented by Congresswoman Terri Sewell, who first won the seat in 2010. 86. But Black voters in Alabama have been lim- ited to a single Black member of Congress for thirty years. And because of the state's racially polarized vot- ing, it is unlikely to elect another Black candidate to Congress absent the creation of a second majority- Black district. 87. Black Alabamians have fared no better in statewide elections. Not a sing le statewide office in the state is held by a Black official\u2014indeed, a Black official has not held a statewide office in the past 21 years. And JA340 no Black Alabamian has held a non-judicial statewide office. Even the only two Blac k candidates ever to have won a statewide judicial election have done so only af- ter first being appointed by the Governor. 88. Finally, although the state's Legislature has several Black members, the lion's share of these legis- lators won their seats only after court-ordered redis- tricting plans created new majority-Black districts. Without majority-Black districts, Black candidates are highly unlikely to retain these seats, let alone win new ones, due to the white majority's voting as a bloc to pre- vent Black voters from electing candidates of their choice. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF COUNT I Violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act Vote Dilution 89. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by refer- ence all prior paragraphs of this Complaint and the paragraphs in the count below as though fully set forth herein. 90. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act prohibits the enforcement of any voting qualification or prereq- uisite to voting or any standard, practice, or procedure that results in the denial or abridgement of the right of any U.S. citizen to vote on account of race, color, or membership in a language majority-Black group. 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301(a). JA341 91. The district boundaries created by 1 com- bine to \"crack\" and \"pack\" Black Alabamians, resulting in the dilution of their electo ral strength in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 92. Black Alabamians are sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to constitute a majority of eligible voters in two congressional districts. 93. Black voters in CDs 1, 2, 3, and 7 are politi- cally cohesive, and elections in the state reveal a clear pattern of racially polarized voting that allows blocs of white voters usually to de feat Black-preferred candi- dates. 94. The totality of the circumstances establishes that the enacted congressional plan has the effect of denying Black voters an equal opportunity to partici- pate in the political process and to elect candidates of their choice, in violation of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 10301. 95. In enforcing the district boundaries in HB 1, Defendant has acted and, absen t relief from this Court, will act to deny Plaintiffs' rights guaranteed to them by Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

The Black Belt includes the core counties of Barbour, Bullock, Butler, Choctaw, Crenshaw, Dallas, Greene, Hale, Lowndes, Macon, Marengo, Montgomery, Perry, Pickens, Pike, Russell, Sumter, and Wilcox. Clarke, Conecuh, Escambia, Monroe, and Washington counties are sometimes included within the definition of the Black Belt. Pre-2011 Congressional District Plans 35. In early 1992, Alabama consented in litiga- tion to create its first majority-Black congressional dis- trict, Wesch v. Hunt , 785 F. Supp. 1491 (S.D. Ala. 1992). 36. Following the 2000 Census, Alabama enacted a new seven-district congressional plan (the \"2001 Plan\") in which CD 7 remain ed the only majority-mi- nority district. 37. After the establishment of CD 7 as a major- ity-Black district in the 1992 Plan, Earl Hillard be- came the first Black Alabamian to be elected to Congress in the Twentieth Century. 38. In the general congressional elections of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008, Artur Davis, a Black Dem- ocrat, was elected in CD 7 after winning a majority of Black voters. JA346 39. In each of the general congressional elections of 2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008, Representative Davis won election with no less than 74.9% of the vote. 40. In the November 2010 general congressional election, Terri Sewell, a Black Democrat, was elected in CD 7 after winning a majority of Black voters. 41. In the November 2010 general congressional election, Representative Sewell won election in CD 7 with 72% of the vote, beating her white opponent by 45 points. 42. In the Twentieth century, Black Alabamians have never elected a Black person to Congress outside of the majority-Black CD 7, and only since 1992. 43. In congressional races in the current major- ity-white CDs 1, 2, and 3, Black candidates have never won election to Congress. 44. In 2010, CD 7 under the 2001 Plan had a Black voting-age population (\"BVAP\") of 60.11%. 2011 Congressional District Plan (\"the 2011 Plan\") 45. In 2011, Alabama enacted a seven-district congressional plan with one majority-minority district, CD 7. 46. The 2011 Plan increased the BVAP of CD 7 from 60.11% to 60.91% AP Black and 60.55% SR Black, according to 2010 Census data. JA347 47. In the 2012 general congressional election\u2014 the first held under the 2011 Plan\u2014Representative Sewell won 75% of the vote in a contested race, beating her opponent by 51 points. 48. In each election since 2012, Representative Sewell has run unopposed in the general election. * * * The 2021 Plan 92. The enacted congressional plan contains only one majority-minority district\u2014CD 7. 93. According to 2020 Census data, CD 7 in the 2021 Plan has a BVAP of 55.26% AP Black and 54.22% SR Black. 94. Under the 2021 Plan, CDs 1, 2, 4, and 6 bor- der CD 7. State Board of Education (\"SBOE\") Plans i. The 2011 SBOE Plan 95. The Alabama SBOE is a nine-member body that sets education policy for Alabama's K-12 schools. The Governor serves as the president of the SBOE, and the remaining eight members are elected to the Board from single-member districts. 96. In 2011, Alabama adopted an eight-district SBOE Plan (the \"2011 SBOE Plan\") with two majority- minority districts, Districts 4 and 5, in central and southern Alabama. JA348 97. According to 2010 Census data, District 4 was 51.4% AP BVAP, and District 5 was 57.5% AP BVAP. 98. District 5 of the SBOE Plan includes the City of Mobile and many of the Black Belt Counties. 99. Based upon the 2020 Census data, Districts 4 and 5 under the 2011 SBOE Plan remain majority AP BVAP. 2011 SBOE District 4 is 51.5% and 2011 SBOE District 5 is 57.7%. 100. In each election since 2011, a Black Demo- crat won a majority of Black voters and the election in Districts 4 and 5 of the SBOE. District 5 of the SBOE Plan connects the City of Mobile to the Black Belt Counties. ii. The 2021 SBOE Plan 101. The 2021 SBOE Plan adopted by the Ala- bama legislature and signed by Gov. Ivey on Nov. 4, 2021, includes two majority Black BOE districts in central and southern Alabama, Districts 4 and 5. 102. District 4 is 51.21% SR BVAP and District 5 is 51.27% SR BVAP. 103. According to the 2020 Census data, the com- bined SR Black population in the two majority Black districts represent more than half of the statewide Black population. JA349 III. Gingles Preconditions 104 In the 2019 Chestnut v. Merrill , Case No. 2:18-cv-00907-KOB, litigation, Plaintiffs' mapping ex- pert Mr. Bill Cooper prepared multiple illustrative con- gressional plans that contained two majority-minority districts in central and southern Alabama. 105. In drawing the Illustrative Plans, Mr. Cooper used the 2011 Plan as his starting point and used the 2011 SBOE Plan as a guide for where in the State a second majority-Black congressional district could be drawn. 106. According to 2010 Census data, each of the 2019 illustrative plans featured CDs 2 and 7 that had voting-age populations that were more than 50% AP Black. 107. According to the 2010 Census data, multiple of the 2019 illustrative plans featured CDs 2 and 7 that had voting-age populations that were more than 50% SR Black. 108. Each of the 2019 illustrative plans split Mo- bile County between two congressional districts. 109. In 2017, a Democrat was elected to the U.S. Senate (Doug Jones). 110. All but one of the Black representatives in the Alabama Legislature are elected from majority-mi-nority districts. JA350 IV. Totality of the Circumstances 111. After Reconstruction, Alabama lawmakers held a constitutional convention in 1901 with the pur-pose of enacting a political structure that would main- tain white supremacy and prevent Black participation. 112. The 1901 Convention adopted election structures meant to disenfranchise Black Alabamians, including a literacy test, employment requirements, property qualifications, a cu mulative poll tax, and dis- enfranchisement of those convicted of minor crimes. 113. The 1901 Convention created exemptions from their discriminatory devices that sought to limit those devices' disenfranchisement of white voters. 114. A new amendment in 1951 required all voter registration applicants to be able to read and write any article of the U.S. Constitution, among other arbitrary and discretionary things. And in some coun- ties, the board of registrars implemented a \"white voucher\" rule, which require d Black applicants to have a white person vouch for their qualifications to register to vote. And some counties, like Bullock County be-tween 1946 to 1955, wholly refused the voter registra- tion applications of Black Alabamians. 115. In 1964 and 1965, Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark, Alabama state troop ers, and vigilantes vio- lently assaulted peaceful Black protesters attempting to gain access to the franchise. 116. On March 7, 1965, in what became known as Bloody Sunday, state troopers viciously attacked JA351 and brutally beat unarmed peaceful civil rights activ- ists crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, where less than 5 percent of Black voters were regis- tered to vote. Bloody Sunday helped pave the way for the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965 and Ala- bama was declared a \"covered\" state under Section 4(b) of the Act. 117. Between 1965 and 1982, the Justice Depart- ment (\"DOJ\") objected 58 ti mes to propose d changes to election practices or procedures in Alabama and sent observers to the State 107 times. Ten of the objections were to preclearance submi ssions by the State, and 48 were to preclearance subm issions by local jurisdic- tions. 118. Between 1982 and 2006, DOJ objected to preclearance submissions from Alabama 46 times\u2014 seven from the State and 39 from local jurisdictions\u2014 and sent federal observers to the State 91 times. The most recent objection to a preclearance submission from the State was in 1994. 119. In 1982, DOJ objected to Alabama's legisla- tive redistricting plans, stat ing that it was because the plans reduced the number of majority-minority dis- tricts and fragmented minority voting strength in a portion of the Black Belt. 120. There is no slating process involved in Ala- bama's congressional elections. 121. Alabama has never had more than one African-American congressional representative, and JA352 no African American has been elected to the U.S. House of Representatives outside of CD 7. 122. There are currently no African-American statewide officials in Alabama. 123. Only two African Americans have been elected to statewide office in Alabama, and both ran as incumbents after first being appointed. No Black per- son has won statewide office in Alabama since 1996. 124. None of the current statewide elected offi- cials are Black. Only two Bl ack people have ever been elected to statewide office. In both instances, the office was associate justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. In 1982 and 1988, the late Justice Oscar W. Adams, Jr. was elected to two consecut ive terms; and, in 1994, Jus- tice Ralph D. Cook won an unopposed statewide elec- tion. In 2000, both Justice Cook and the then-recently appointed Justice John England, both Black Demo- crats, lost elections to white Republican candidates. 125. On Tuesday, July 23, a special election was held to fill a vacancy in District 73 of the Alabama House of Representatives. The winner was Kenneth Paschal, the Republican cand idate, who received 2,743 votes. Representative Paschal is African American. His white Democratic opponent received 920 votes. District 73 is located in Shelby County, Alabama. Based on 2010 census data, the voting-age population of District 73 was 84.12% white and 9.75% black. (See ALBC doc. 338-1). Representative Paschal defeated a white Re- publican candidate in the primary election by 64 votes. JA353 Representative Paschal received 1,476 votes, while his white opponent received 1,412 votes. 126. In 2014, following the Supreme Court's de- cision in Shelby County v. Holder , Alabama's photo identification law went into effect. JA354 UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA SOUTHERN DIVISION MARCUS CASTER, et al., Plaintiffs, v. JOHN H.

BRIDGETT KING (Filed Dec. 14, 2021) Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, I, Bridgett King, make the following declaration: 1. My name is Bridgett King, and I reside in Opelika, Alabama. I have been asked by attorneys for the plain- tiffs in this litigation to examine the history of race dis- crimination in voting in Alabama, and the impact that racial discrimination has on the ability of Black voters in Alabama to participate equally in the political pro- cess and elect candidates of their choice. The analysis that follows is based on my expertise as a political and social scientist. JA355 2. I have employed the standard methodology used in my field of expertise in this declaration.1 My hourly rate of compensation in this case is $300.00. Qualifications 3. I am faculty in the department of Political Science at Auburn University. I have been on the faculty since the 2014/2015 academic year and currently hold the rank of Associate Professor with tenure. I additionally serve as the Director of the Master of Public Admin- istration Program. As a member of the Auburn Univer-sity faculty, I teach under graduate courses in state policy and governance and gr aduate courses in policy analysis, public administration and service, and diver-sity in public administration. 4. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Psychology from Hampton University in 2003; a Master's Degree in Jus- tice Studies from Kent State University in 2006 and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Political Science in 2012 from Kent State University. 5. My doctoral dissertation en titled, \"The Effect of State Policy On The Individual Vote Decisions Of Afri- can Americans In Presidential And Midterm Elections, 1 In performing this type of analysis, political and social sci- entists examine sources such as re levant scholarly studies, news- paper articles on historical events, reports of state or federal governments, and relevant court de cisions. We also use secondary data and data sets collected by governments and other reputable research entities to understand political behavior. We use appro-priate quantitative methodologic al approaches to analyze such data, adhering to standard conventi ons of statistical significance. JA356 1996 To 2008\" evaluates the effect of seven state voting policies (registration closin g date, photo identification requirements, statewide computer registration data- base, in person early voting, Election Day registration, no excuse absentee voting, and felony disenfranchise- ment) on Black turnout in Presidential and midterm elections from 1996 to 2008. I used individual-level data from the US Census Bureau Current Population Survey (\"CPS\") that was me rged with detailed state level voting policy, demographic, social and economic indicators. Using a series of multilevel models, I ana- lyzed the effect of policy variations on the Black popu- lation. 6. Following the completion of my doctorate, I was a voting rights researcher at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York Universi ty School of Law. In my role as a voting rights researcher, I was responsible for original research\u2014including empirical research, inter-views of public officials and private individuals, collec- tion and analysis of pub lic data, news searches and the supervision of research. Working with other voter rights advocates I developed and coordinated a 2012 Presidential election voter survey that was adminis- tered in six states. I also conducted a county level analysis of the quality of vo ter registration databases across the United States and a preliminary analysis of Election Day voter challenges. 7. My current research fo cuses on election admin- istration, public policy, citi zen voting experiences, and race and ethnicity. Overarching themes in my writ- ings include the administrative structure of felony JA357 disenfranchisement policies and their effect on par- ticipation and representation, citizen confidence in electoral outcomes, and the consequences of adminis- trative discretion on voter experiences and democratic representation. I also work on interdisciplinary pro- jects that apply systems and architectural engineering approaches to the field of election administration to ad-dress challenges associated with administrative deci- sion-making and voter experiences. 8. I have received external support for my research in election administration from the National Science Foundation, Rockefeller Family Fund, Democracy Fund, and others. I also hold posi tions in several election ad- ministration and research focused projects and initia- tives. I am currently on the Electoral Integrity Project International Academic Advisory Board, a track leader with the Election and Voting Information Center (EVIC), and a research partner with the University of Rhode Island Voter Operations and Election Systems (URIVOTES). 9. I am also regularly asked to speak on domestic and international academic and practitioner panels on is- sues related to election administration and participate in domestic and international election observation ef- forts. 10. In addition to teaching at Auburn University, I am an instructor in the National Association of Elec- tion Officials (Election Center) Certified Elections/ Registration Administrator (\"CERA\") Program. In the CERA Program I teach course s that have a substantive JA358 focus on communication, voter participation, state con- stitutions and court cases fr om early America to 1965, the history of elections from 1781 to the present, and federal interventions in elections and voter registra-tion from the 1960s to the present. 11. I have published 10 journal articles, edited 4 books, and authored 8 book chapters and 3 applied re- ports. Much of this scholarship focuses on the admin- istration of elections. 12. My research has appeared in the Election Law Journal, Journal of Black Studies, Social Science Quar-terly, Government Information Quarterly, Policy Stud- ies, and the Journal of Information Technology and Politics. I have contributed to and edited multiple book manuscripts, including, Voting Rights in America: Pri- mary Documents in Context, The Future of Election Ad- ministration, The Future of Election Administration: Cases and Conversations , and Why Don't Americans Vote? Causes and Consequences. Brief Summary of Conclusions 13. This report reviews Alabama's well-documented, pervasive, and sordid history of racial discrimination in the context of voting and political participation. The combination of the continuing effects of this discrimi- nation (as reflected in racial disparities in social and economic indicators such as rates of unemployment, poverty, education, and healthcare), the persistence of severe and ongoing racially polarized voting, and the state's racialized politics significantly and adversely JA359 impact the ability of Black Alabamians to participate equally in the state's political process. The district map challenged in this lawsuit shou ld be viewed in this con- text. SENATE FACTORS 14. This report examines the factors established by the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in 1982 to guide courts in assessing the totality of circumstances rele- vant to a Section 2 claim that a challenged law impedes the ability of a minority group to participate equally in the political process. 2 15. The Senate Factors are: Factor 1: The extent of any history of official discrimination in the state or political subdi-vision that touched the right of members of the minority group to register, vote, or other- wise to participate in the democratic process; Factor 2: The extent to which voting in the elections of the state or political subdivision is racially polarized; 3 Factor 3: The extent to which the state or po- litical subdivision has used unusually large 2 See Thornburg v. Gingles , 478 U.S. 30, 45 (1986); United States Department of the Justice, Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, (Sept. 14, 2018), https://www.ju stice.gov/crt/sec tion-2-voting rights-act. 3 My report does not analyze the extent to which voting in Alabama is racially polarized, as I understand another expert re- tained by Plaintiffs will provide such analysis. JA360 election districts, majority vote requirements, anti-single shot provisions, or other voting practices or procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the mi-nority group; Factor 4: If there is a candidate slating pro- cess, whether the members of the minority group have been denied access to that pro- cess; 4 Factor 5: The extent to which members of the minority group in the state or political subdivision bear the effects of discrimination in such areas as education, employment and health, which hinder th eir ability to partici- pate effectively in the political process; Factor 6: Whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals; and Factor 7: The extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction. The Judiciary Committee also noted that the court could consider additional factors such as: Factor 8: Whether there is a significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected offi- cials to the particularized needs of the mem- bers of the minority group; and 4 My report does not address this factor as recent Alabama elections have not utilized slating processes. JA361 Factor 9: Whether the policy underlying the state or political subdivision's use of such voting qualification, prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure is tenuous.5 Senate Factor 1: History of official discrimination in Alabama affecting Black Alabamians' poli tical participation. 16. Limiting Black Americans ' ability to fully partic- ipate in civic life by enacting discriminatory measures has been an integral part of Alabama politics and cul- ture. A. Foundational Discrimination Against Black Alabamians 17. Following the Civil War, during the Reconstruc- tion Era, the state actively passed polici es with the explicit goal of limiting the ability of newly enfran- chised Black Americans to exercise their newfound political rights secured by the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. 18. After the passage of the 13th Amendment by the United States Congress in January 1865, Alabama amended its constitution in September 1865. Article I, Sections 5 and 8 of Alabama' s newly amended consti- tution explicitly stated that only white males could be senators or representatives, and Article VIII, Section 1 stated that only white males were qualified to vote. 5 S. Rep. No. 97-417, at 28-29 (1982). JA362 19. After the passage of the 14th Amendment, Ala- bama again amended its constitution. The 1868 consti- tution, or \"Second Reconstruction Constitution,\" which was required for Alabama to be admitted back to the union, removed its race qualification for senators and representatives and the race qualifications for voting. 6 20. Soon thereafter, however, Democratic party lead- ers began a program of raci al discrimination and voter suppression. When white leaders in Alabama gathered for the state's 1901 Constitutional Convention, they stated on the record that th eir express goal was to es- tablish \"white supremacy in the State.\" 7 The state's now infamous voting restrictions were thus born. The 1901 Constitution codified literacy tests and mandated the payment of a $1.50 cumulative poll tax, both of which were intended to keep Black Alabamians from the polls. As one supporter of these measures stated, Alabama \"want[ed] that poll tax to stack up so high that he will never be able to vote again.\" 8 The state's poll tax survived until 1966.9 6 Martin, D.

Voters were also required to demonstrate the ability to read and write a section of the U.S. Constitu- tion, a requirement that gave broad discretion to elec- tion officials to apply the test more strictly against Black applicants. 10 Black applicants were often rejected for \"formal, technical, and inconsequential\" errors. As an example, Black voters had their registration forms rejected because they did not sign an oath, despite of- ten not being told that they had to sign an oath. By contrast, white applicants we re often provided assis- tance in passing the test. 11 22. The 1901 constitution also imposed employment and property requirements on voters, again intended to exclude Black Alabamians from the electorate. Ap- plicants were required to demonstrate one year of em-ployment and the possession of 40 acres of land or property valued at $300.00 or more. To ensure white voters weren't accidentally disenfranchised by these provisions, Section 180 of the 1901 constitution in- cluded a grandfather clause allowing the registration of any qualifying adult male who was a veteran of a nineteenth century American war or a descendant of a veteran, even if they were unable to meet the other 10 Cianci Salvatore, S., Foley N., Iverson, P. & Lawson, S.

The constitution also disqualified voters if they committed minor crimes such as vagrancy and larceny, or vague crimes of moral failing and mental deficiency. This broad, and often standardless, definition of dis-qualifying crimes provided white officials an addi- tional and highly effective tool to disenfranchise Black voters. Specifically, Article VIII, Section 182 states, The following persons shall be disqualified both from registering and from voting, namely: All idiots and insane persons; those who shall by reason of conviction of crime be disqualified from voting at the time of the rat-ification of this Constitution; those who shall be convicted of treason, murder, arson, embez- zlement, malfeasance in office, larceny, receiv-ing stolen property, obtaining property or money under false preten ses, perjury, subor- nation of perjury, robbery, assault with intent to rob, burglary, forgery, bribery, assault and battery on the wife, bigamy, living in adultery, sodomy, incest, rape, miscegenation, crime against nature, or any crime punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, or of any in- famous crime or crime involving moral turpi-tude; also, any person who shall be convicted as a vagrant or tramp, or of selling or offering to sell his vote or the vote of another, or of making or offering to make false return in any election by the people or in any primary elec- tion to procure the nomination or election of any person to any office, or of suborning any JA365 witness or registrar to secure the registration of any person as an elector.12 24. The adoption of the literacy test and poll tax require- ments all but eliminated the Black voting population in Alabama. In 1900, there were 180,000 registered Black voters in Alabama. By 1903 there were fewer than 3,000.13 In 1906, five years after the adoption of the 1901 Constitution, only two percent of the Black voting age population remained on the voter registra-tion rolls in Alabama. 14 25. The state's program of disenfranchisement was not limited to voting laws. The state also actively worked to reduce the ability of Black Americans to par- ticipate in elections and public life. For example, the state adopted the secret ba llot, which replaced the use of voice voting and party printed ballots for elections. The secret ballots also served as a de facto literacy test because they prohibited voters from receiving assis- tance to read and cast the ballot. The Sayre Act (1893) empowered the Alabama Governor to appoint election officials and make changes to the election system, a process that is widely underst ood to have been designed 12 The Constitution of Alabama, (1901), available at https:// constitutii.files.wordpre ss.com/2013/02/alabama.pdf. 13 McCrary, P., Gray, J.A., Stil l, E., Perry, H.L (1994).

Further still, in 1902 the Democratic Party adopted the all-white primary for statewide elections. After the white primary was ruled unconstitutional in Smith v. Allwright , 321 U.S. 649 (1944), the state adopted the Boswell Amendment (1946), which re- quired that an applicant for voter registration not only be able to read and write a section of the US Constitu- tion, but also \"understand and explain\" it. 17 In 1949, the Southern District of Alabama in Davis v. Schnell , concluded that the \"underst and and explain\" text vio- lated the 14th and 15th amendments. 81 F.Supp. 872, 878-80 (S.D. Ala. 1949), aff 'd , 336 U.S. 933 (1949).

And yet the state pressed on with new policies that prevented Black Alabamians from participating in the political process. In 1951 a new constitutional amendment required that voter registration appli-cants be able to read and wr ite any article of the fed- eral constitution, be of go od character, and embrace the duties and obligations of citizenship under the fed-eral and state constitutions. \"In order to aid the local board of registrars in determining whether an appli- cant satisfied these requirements, the applicant was required to answer in writing and without assistance a questionnaire, or application form, prescribed by the Alabama Supreme Court.\" 19 From January 1952 to February 1964, the state used a four-page application and form.20 In January 1964 the Alabama Supreme Court modified the form and questionnaire and in-cluded questions testing the applicant's knowledge of government, including the names of government offi- cials, four excerpts from th e federal constitution, and a space in which the applicant was to write from dicta- tion several words from the federal constitution. Again, these changes were intended to prevent Black Alabam- ians from voting. 21 18 H. B. E, & K., Jr., supra n. 11 at 1092. 19 Id. 20 Id. at 1123. 21 Id. at 1093. JA368 28. The voter registration application also allowed lo- cal registrars to demand an affirmation under oath by a supporting witness, who must also be a registered voter, who could attest to knowing the applicant and possessing personal knowledge of the applicant's resi- dence and length of residence in the county and state. 22 This affirmation was not required by law and its appli-cation was at the sole dis cretion of the registrars. While some counties did not require a supporting wit- ness, in other counties the witness affirmation require-ment was applied only to Black voters. 23 29. In some counties, the Board of Registrars adopted a \"white voucher rule\" which required voter registra- tion applicants to have a white person vouch for their qualifications, which was me ant to prevent Blacks from registering. Where this was in effect, white voter registration applicants were often provided a voucher by the registrars.24 30. Other counties developed novel measures to slow down the process of voter registration among Black cit-izens. In some counties Black Alabamians were made to wait in excessively long voter registration lines, were instructed to register at a specific time, were not 22 Id. at 1097. 23 \"A federal dist rict court in United States v. Hines found that in Sumpter County while the requirement has been strictly applied to Nego applicants, its use has been a mere formality for whites, who have been given assistance in finding the necessary witness.\" Id. at 1097 (citing United States v. Hines , 9 Race Rel. L. Rep. 1332 (N. D. Ala. 1964) (Sumter County)). 24 Id. at 1099. JA369 informed when the voter registration office would be open, were not permitted to apply for registration after a prior rejection, and had their ballots rejected without notice of rejection or reason for their rejection. The lack of notice of rejection or re ason for rejection failed to provide Black applicants with sufficient time or infor- mation to effectively appeal their rejection during the 30-day appeal window. In some countries, the regis- trars would simply close the office. 25 Elsewhere, regis- trars would simply not a llow Blacks to register.26 For example, in Bullock County, the Board of Registrars re- fused applications from Black Alabamians from 1946 until 1955. 31. Even in communities where Black Alabamians had enhanced opportunities for education and employ-ment, elected officials' effort s to reduce and eliminate Black political participation was effective. In Tuskegee (Macon County) home of Tuskegee University, 27 where after World War II Blacks held a majority of the white- collar jobs and there was an educated Black middle class, unequal application of the literacy test created an environment where Black college graduates were no more likely to pass the literacy test than those who possessed slightly more than a grade school educa-tion. The Board of Registrars would also require Black but not white voters to provide the name of three 25 Id. 26 Id. at 1091. 27 Founded in 1881 by Booker T. Washington, the Tuskegee Institute remained an \"institute\" until 1985 when it obtained \"university\" status. JA370 registered voters who could vouch for them. Because there were so few Blacks on the voter rolls, the number of registered Black Alabamians remained low. By 1958, Blacks were 84 percent of Macon County's population, but white voters outnumbered Black voters by two and a half times. 28 32. In a 1956 study, a political scientist at the Uni- versity of Alabama concluded that this registration process \"was designed to be discriminatory\" and conse-quently served to bar Blac k Alabamians from voting. 29 The scientist concluded that even an \"honestly de- signed educational test\" would \"bar the ballot to the great mass of uneducated Negroes.\" 30 33. United States v. Penton , 212 F.Supp. 193 (1962), highlighted the devastating effect of not only the liter- acy test but also its application. The case centered on the Montgomery County Board of Registrars and their use of their discretion when reviewing the Alabama voter application form, which included a literacy test. In that specific case, the Court found that: Approximately 8,868 applications were filed by white persons, 4,522 by Black persons. 28 Salvatore, et al., supra n.10. 29 Strong, D. S (1956). Registration of voters in Alabama. University of Alabama: Universi ty of Alabama Bureau of Public Administration: Tuscaloosa, AL. 30 Id. at 120. JA371 Under 4 percent of the white applicants were rejected, over 75 percent of the Black appli- cants were rejected. 710 of the rejected Black applicants had 12 grades of formal education or more, six of whom had master's degrees, 152 had four years of college training, and 222 had some college education. Question 5 was filled out completely by the Board of Registrars for white persons but not for Black persons. On other specific questions, whites were assisted and Black persons were required to fill them out without assistance. In general, the application form used as a \"tricky\" examination for Black persons and purely to obtain substantive information from white persons; almost all Black applicants were rejected for a single error while almost 1,070 of the accepted white applications con-tained technical errors. 31 34. As the federal government slowly began to adopt remedies for voting rights violations in the south, and civil rights activists worked to demonstrate the need to dismantle disenfranchisement more directly, Black Alabamians remained largel y excluded from voting; in 1965, only 23 percent of Blacks in the state could vote. 32 31 See Penton , 212 F. Supp. at 196-98. 32 Salvatore, et al., supra n.10. JA372 35. After the all-white primary was struck down in 1944, many counties in Alabama responded by adopt- ing at-large elections, with the intent of preventing majority-minority communities from electing candi-dates of their choice. The state sought to achieve the same end in 1951 when it prohibited single-shot voting in municipal elections. 36. In 1951, a restriction on single shot voting or a full slate law was applied to all Alabama counties. 33 Prior to that provision, the at-large voting systems in some counties made it possible for Black Alabamians to elect a member of the city council if multiple seats were being filled in the same election: if they were po- litically cohesive, Black voters could secure the election of a Black candidate by cast ing only votes for that can- didate and otherwise failing to cast the full number of votes suggested. The 1951 provi sion made single shot voting impossible by disqualifying ballots that did not make selections equal to the full slate of seats. 34 A pro- ponent of the law justified its need by stating, \"there are some who fear that the colored voters might be well able to elect one of their own race to the city council by single shot voting.\" 35 37. The single shot provision was replaced by num- bered places in 1961. Numbered-place laws, also used in at-large elections with multiple candidates, desig-nate each position by a separate number, require that 33 McCrary, supra , n.13. 34 Id. 35 Id. at 46. JA373 each candidate qualify and run for a specific number, and allow each voter to only vote for one candidate in each number.36 \"Such laws are also potential means for perfecting majority control; the same jurisdiction-wide majority can control each and every seat when can- didates must compete directly for specific seats.\"37 Steadily, Alabama jurisdictions adopted a voting sys-tem requiring at-large elections, numbered places, and a majority vote, making it virtually impossible for Blacks to elect candidates of their choice without sub-stantial crossover voting by whites. 38 38. By enacting these various measures, the State sought to prevent its Black population from organizing their votes around one candidate. 39. So desperate were counties in Alabama to elimi- nate the Black vote that in 1957, Alabama redrew the boundaries of the city of Tu skegee to exclude Black res- idents to ensure that city elections could be controlled by white residents, an act the U.S. Supreme Court held was intentionally discriminatory.

R. 26(3) , 523-584, https://scholarship.law. vanderbilt.edu/v 1r/vo126/iss3/9/. 37 Pildes, R. H. & Donoghue, K. A. (1995). Cumulative voting in the United States. University of Chicago Legal Forum,1995 (1), 241-313, Modern Discrimination Against Black Ala- bamians 40. Following the passage of the Voting Rights Act (\"VRA\") in 1965, the state relied on other administra- tive mechanisms to limit the political power of Black Alabamians, many of which were invalidated by fed- eral courts. In Sims v. Baggett , 247 F.Supp. 96 (M.D. Ala. 1965), the court invalidated a reapportionment plan that combined majority white and majority Black counties; stating the clear pu rpose was to discriminate against Black voters. 39 In Sims v. Amos , 336 F.Supp. 924 (M.D. Ala. 1972), the court ruled that the use of multi-member districts tends to discriminate against Black people.40 41. In Dillard v. Crenshaw Cty. , 640 F.Supp. 128 (M.D. Ala. 1986), the court found that counties' use of at-large elections were the result of intentional discrimination. This litigation was subsequently ex- panded to include nearly 200 defendants, most of whom settled and agreed to eliminate their at-large systems. 42. Other court cases point to the use of administra- tive rules and procedures to limit the ability of Black Alabamians to fully participa te in elections and other democratic processes. See, e.g., Buskey v. Oliver , 574 F.Supp. 41 (1983) (finding that city districting plan adopted for racially di scriminatory purpose); Bolden v. City of Mobile , Id. JA375 (at-large voting for city commissioners adopted with racially discriminatory purpose); Sims v. Baggett , 247 F.Supp. 96 (M.D. Ala. 1965) (finding that state house districts were drawn to discriminate against Black vot-ers). 43. Due to the history described above, Alabama and its local jurisdictions beca me subject to the VRA's pre- clearance process, which required them to obtain pre- clearance before implem enting any new policies affecting voting and registration. The preclearance re- quirement limited Alabama's ability to legislatively or administratively adopt rules that adversely affected the political power of Black Alabamians. 44. All told, between 1965 and 2013, at least 100 voting changes proposed by Alabama state, county, or city officials were eithe r blocked or altered under the VRA. 41 These objections included a wide range of potential changes and included districting and redis- tricting plans, the annexation and de-annexation of ge- ographic areas, changes from single member districts to at-large elections, increasing the size of representa- tive bodies, voter purges, and voter re-identification. In just one example of these incidents, after Hale County had been sent federal observers under the VRA, the county changed its electoral sy stem from district to at- large elections. A federal district court concluded that \"the change to at-large voting . . . had the purpose and . . . the effect of abridging the right to vote on the basis 41 Blacksher, supra n.15. JA376 of race.\" Hale , 496 F.Supp. 1206, 1207 (D.D.C. 1980). 45. The U.S. Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, which provided the formula determining which juris- dictions were subject to preclearance. After Shelby County removed Alabama from covered status, the state rapidly made changes to voting and registration policies and procedures. 46. One of the first changes Alabama made to its vot- ing laws was to institute one of the most rigorous voter identification requirements in the nation. 42 This law was originally adopted in 2011. At the time, Alabama was subject to preclearance under the VRA. Alabama never even submitted the law for federal review. 43 47. Shortly after the Shelby County decision was is- sued, Alabama began enforcing its voter identification law. The law requires all voters to present one of 11 approved forms of identification or be positively iden-tified by two election officials. If the voter does not have the approved identification and cannot be positively identified by two election offic ials, the voter may cast a provisional ballot. For the provisional ballot to be counted, the voter must present a proper form of photo 42 Alabama Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (2020).

Brennan Center for Justice. JA377 identification to the Board of Registrars by 5:00 p.m. the Friday following Election Day.44 48. Despite the various types of identification ac- cepted, during testimony before the Alabama Advisory Committee to U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Secre- tary of State John Merrill explained that \"the most common forms of voter identification are state issued identification cards\u2014such as a driver's license, a non- driver identification, or an Alabama Photo Voter ID card.\" 45 The driver's license and nondriver identifica- tion cards can be acquired from the Motor Vehicles Di- vision offices. The Alabama Photo Voter ID Card can be obtained from the Office of the Secretary of State, the 67 County Board of Registrar Offices, or the Secretary of State's mobile identification unit.46 49. However, in 2015, in response to a budget dispute, then-Governor Robert Bentley closed 31 Motor Vehicle Division offices in Alabama. In 2016, the U.S. Depart- ment of Transportation inve stigated the closures and concluded that they adversely affected counties with majority Black and rural populations. Statistics from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency and census data for the state show that 8 of the 11 counties in Al-abama that have a majority or near majority black 44 See Ala. Code \u00a7 17-9-30 et seq Advisory Committee, supra n.42. 46 Alabama Secretary of State (n.d.).

JA378 population, i.e., approximately 72.7 percent suffered closure of MVD offices in their counties, compared to 23 of the 56 majority white counties in the state, about 41.1 percent. 50. In response to the Department of Transporta- tion's findings, the state re-opened offices in some of the affected counties with limited hours. Two such counties were Wilcox and Bullock. Both are poor, pre- dominantly Black, rural counties. For one year, the Al-abama Advisory Committee unsuccessfully tried to ascertain the days and hours of operation for the Motor Vehicles Division Office in Wilcox County. \"When the chair of the Committee called the number that was listed for the office, no one answered the phone regard- less of when she called. There was no recorded message to offer hours of operation. A call made by the Chair of the Committee to the Wilcox County clerk's office pro- duced a suggestion that she travel to another county to obtain a driver's license.\" 47 Similar challenges were re- ported by those trying to determine the hours of oper- ation for the Bullock County Motor Vehicles Division Office. This situation was reminiscent of counties' his- torical failure to provide Black residents with voting information, as discussed above. 51. One of the many observations made by the Ala- bama Advisory Committee was that Bullock County had no website and the information about Motor Vehi- cle Offices that was posted on the Alabama Law En- forcement Agency website was either incorrect or the 47 Alabama Advisory Committee, supra n.42. JA379 hours posted were not consistently kept. The Commit- tee concluded that either possibility creates a hurdle for a voter seeking an identification from the offices in question. 52. The lack of accessible online information in the state is not limited to Moto r Vehicle Offices. After con- ducting an extensive review of Alabama counties, re- searchers found that 47 of 67 counties have county websites. Of those counties, 43 had websites specifi- cally for voting and elections.48 53. A study analyzing the post-Shelby County closure of polling locations found that there were at least 66 fewer polling locations in Alabama than there were prior. The analysis also found that the reduction was the result of decisions made in 12 counties. Although the study included a relatively small sample of 18 Ala- bama counties and did not identify any definitive ra-cial pattern, the authors noted concern over such a small number of counties eliminating that many poll- ing locations. 49 For example, Daphne County, Alabama eliminated 3 of 5 polling loc ations; two of the three 48 King, B.A., & Youngblood, N.E.

In addition to navigating a complex system of ad- ministrative policies and procedures and cultural rules that have limited, and continue to limit, the ability of Black Alabamians to participate in the political pro- cess, they have also been intimidated against partici-pating in social, political, and economic life by physical force and violence. Indeed, \"[v]iolence was central to suppressing the Black vote in the South.\" 51 After Re- construction, Democrats used violence as a tactic to defeat Republicans. In 1874, \"two Sumter County Re- publican leaders, one black and one white were killed on Election Day and a mob murdered seven Black Americans and wounded nearly 70 others.\" 52 55. Although there are various interpretations about the use of lynching to intimidate potential Black vot- ers, many understand lynching to be a tool central to 50 Sharp, J. (2016, August 4).

JA381 the suppression of Black voting rights.53 \"Since 1874 there have been more than 400 documented lynchings or attempted lynchings of Black men, women and children in Alabama.\"54 \"Nearly 200 Reconstruction- era victims of Alabama racial violence, including those lynched, assaulted, raped, or killed throughout the state [have been identified]. Perpetrators and support-ers of this violence were never prosecuted. Some went on to hold elected office, including Governor George Houston, for whom Houston County is named, and Governor Braxton Bragg Comer.\" 55 Examples of this vi- olence include: In Mobile County in 1865, white mobs killed an estimated 138 Black p eople over several months. In Eutaw, Alabama in November 1870, white mobs attack a political meeting of Black resi-dents and white allies, killing four Black peo- ple. In November 1874 in Eufaula, Alabama, armed white men attack Black voters at the polls on election day and killed at least six Black people. 53 Wells, I. B. (1900). Lynch law in America.

Four Black girls were killed and more than 20 were injured inside the church. The bomb was planted by mem- bers of the Ku Klux Klan. On March 7, 1965, state and local police at- tacked hundreds of civil rights activists begin- ning a march from Selma to Montgomery. The activists were protesting the denial of voting rights for Black Americans and the murder of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a civil rights activist who had been shot by police during a peaceful protest. The protestors were attacked with billy clubs, whips, and gas masks, while cross-ing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma; a day that would come to be known as \"Bloody Sun- day.\" 56 56. Black Alabamians have also been subject to in- timidation at the polls. In Harris v. Graddick , 593 F.Supp. 128, 133 (M.D. Ala. 1984), the court found that state and local officials had \"intentionally created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation to keep black per-sons from voting\" and that \"[t]he present reality in Al- abama is that many black ci tizens, particularly the elderly and uneducated, still be ar the scars of this past, and are still afraid to enga ge in the simple act of reg- istering to vote and voting.\" 57. Cross burnings, which have \"historically been used by the Ku Klux Klan and other racist organizations to 56 Id. JA383 rally supporters and terrorize black people in the South and elsewhere,\" also continue to be a tool used to intimidate Blacks in the South.57 58. In June 2020 a burning cross was placed on a bridge that crosses Interstate 85 in Macon County, Al- abama.58 Macon County is the home of Tuskegee Uni- versity, a Historically Bl ack University. Macon County has a resident population that is 80 percent Black.59 The cross burning was ruled a hate crime by the Fed-eral Bureau of Investigation. 60 D. Redistricting-Related Discrimination Against Black Alabamians 59. Focusing explicitly on the drawing of electoral boundaries, there is an extensive history in Alabama of racial discrimination. 60. Prior to 1960, the Legislat ure failed to reapportion for 50 years. As a result, Alabama's entire legislative apportionment scheme was st ruck down for violating the principle of one person, one vote. Reynolds v. Sims , 57 Associated Press. (2020).

On remand, a court found that, in devising remedial maps to correct the malap- portionment, the \"Legislature intentionally aggregated predominantly Negro counties with predominantly white counties for the sole purpose of preventing the election of Negroes to [State] House membership.\" Sims v. Baggett , 247 F.Supp. 96, 108-109 (M.D. Ala. 1965). 61. Following Reynolds and the 1970 Census, the Legislature again failed to redistrict, forcing a three judge federal court to draw new district lines. Sims v. Amos , 336 F.Supp. 924, 940 (M.D. Ala. 1972). In doing so, the court rejected the Al abama Secretary of State's proposed map because of its racially \"discriminatory effect\" on Black voters. Id. at 936. 62. During the 1980 reapportionment process, the U.S. Department of Justice objected to maps drawn by the Legislature for the State House and Senate be- cause of their discriminatory effect on Black voters in Jefferson County and the Black Belt. The State House plan reduced the number of majority-minority districts within the state. After the state redrew the map, the DOJ objected again, this time because the plan appeared to intentiona lly \"crack\" minority vot- ers in the state's Black Belt counties. 61 A court re- jected Alabama's proposed interim remedial state maps in part because Alabam a's maps \"had the effect 61 Letter from William Bradford Reynolds, Assistant At- torney Gen., Civil Rights Div., Dep't of Justice, to Charles A.

Hobbie , 543 F.Supp. 235, 238 (M.D. Ala. 1982). 63. Following the 1990 Census, the U.S. Department of Justice again objected to Alabama's new proposed congressional plan, which in cluded just one majority- Black district and \"fragmente d\" the rest of the Black population in the state to dilute the Black vote. In its objection letter, the DOJ noted a concern of the Black community that \"an underlying principle of the Con- gressional redistricting was a predisposition on the part of the state political lea dership to limit black vot- ing potential to a single district.\" 62 64. In 2017, a federal court found that race predom- inated in the drawing of 14 state legislative districts, and that 12 of them were unconstitutional due to their inability to satisfy the strict scrutiny standard under the Equal Protection Clause.

As noted above, this report does not analyze the level of racially polarized occurring in Alabama; that analysis will be performe d by a different expert 62 U.S. Dep't of Justice Ltr. to Ala.

Below, however, I discuss how racial attitudes and racialized politics drive the histor- ical and ongoing polarization among Black and white Alabamians. 66. Over many decades during the Twentieth Cen- tury and into the Twenty-First Century, an important political realignment occurred that still frames politics across the United States today. A primary cause of this realignment was a shift in th e stances taken by the two major American political parties on issues relating to race. 67. Following the Emancipation Proclamation and through the Reconstruction Era, many Black Ameri- cans aligned with and supported the Republican Party. At the time, the Republican Party\u2014the party of Abra- ham Lincoln\u2014was viewed as being supportive of Black American social, economic, and political interests. 68. During the Great Depression, however, the Dem- ocratic Party's New Deal offered significant assistance to Black Americans. Although President Roosevelt did not have a civil rights ag enda and Black Americans experienced discrimination when trying to access New Deal Programs, Black Americans were able to participate in programs alongside whites. 63 While Black Americans were ofte n formally excluded from the Democratic Party at the time, their participation in New Deal programs permitted them to participate politically. As an example, Black and white farmers 63 Salvatore, et al., supra n.10. JA387 voted each year to determine the level of cotton pro- duction. 69. The partial relief provided by the New Deal sparked a partisan realignment among Black voters that still drives voting patterns today. In the 1936 elec- tion, for example, the majority of Black voters in the north left the Republican Party and supported the Democratic Party. 64 70. While the New Deal opened the door to this rea- lignment, it was the parties' evolving stances on racial issues that served as the ultimate catalyst. Indeed, scholarship attributes party realignment to race as be- ing the primary factor that \"permanently rearranged the American Party system.\" 65 71. This partisan realignmen t gained its most sig- nificant momentum during the \"Civil Rights Era\" of the mid-Twentieth Century, most notably when Presi- dent Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law. This era \"polarized and solidified the parties' stands on issues affecting African Americans, black support for the 64 Weiss, N. J. (1983).

The Democratic Party's advocacy for racial equal- ity and justice not only attracted the support of Black Americans; it also repelled white voters to the Repub- lican Party. \"As the national Democratic party moved away from its century-long commitment to avoid chal- lenging the Jim Crow system , the civil rights legisla- tion proposed by Northern Democrats immediately attracted massive resistance from Southern Demo- crats in Congress, and support for the Democratic party began to erode among Southern whites.\" 67 73. To hasten the shift of white voters to its side, the Republican Party actively adopted reactionary racial politics. Political Science scholarship substantiates that since the 1960s, the Re publican Party has consist- ently and successfully recruited white voters by adopt-ing racially and culturally conservative positions. 68 66 Hutchings, V. and Nicholas V.

The realignment discussed above has resulted in a political system where Black Americans currently overwhelmingly identify with the Democratic Party. A 2020 analysis found that more than 60% of Black Americans identify as Democrats.70 By contrast, white voters, especially across the South, overwhelmingly identify with the Republican Party.71 75. This historical party realignment, caused by ra- cial politics and coupled wi th the continued prevalence of racial issues and the domi nance of race as a political issue in the south, indicates that racial attitudes con- tinue to structure partisan divisions in Alabama today. 2004. \"The Centrality of Race in American Politics.\" Annual Re- view of Political Science 7:383-408. 69 Valentino, Nicholas A., and David O.

Aside from the significant effect that issues relat- ing to race have had on partisanship, race can be a de- ciding factor in candidate preference more generally. First, literature suggests t hat both black and white voters prefer to vote for candidates of their own race when a contest includes a black and white candidate.72 Second, there is no clear r elationship between the ide- ology of black voters and th eir candidate preferences. For example, while 90% of Black voters supported Barack Obama in 2008, only 47% of Blacks identify as liberal while 45% identify as conservative.73 77. Exit polls from the 2008 election demonstrate this point. They indicate that in the general election, Barack Obama, a Black man, won votes from 98% of Black Alabamians regardles s of party, and John McCain, a white man, received votes from 88% of white Alabamians regardless of party. Obama won only 47% of white Democrats in Alabama, whereas McCain won 51% of white Democrats, 82% of white independents, and 98% of white Republicans. 74 78. This pattern appears within party primaries as well. During the 2008 Democratic Party Primary, Hil- ary Clinton, a white woman, ran in a tight two-person 72 Hutchings and Valentino, supra n.66. 73 Hutchings, V., Jefferson, H., & Brown, K. (2014).

JA391 race against Barack Obama. Exit polls indicate that among those who voted in the Democratic primary in Alabama, 84% of Black voters supported Obama, whereas 72% of white voters supported Clinton.75 79. The same pattern appeared in Alabama's 2008 U.S. Senate election. Exit polls indicate that 90% of Black voters regardless of party supported Vivian Fig- ures, a Black candidate, while 89% of white voters voted for Jeff Sessions, a wh ite candidate, regardless of party. 58% of white Democrats, 88% of white Independ- ents, and 96% of white Republicans voted for Sessions, whereas Figures won the support of 84% of non-white voters, regardless of party. 76 Senate Factor 3: Voting practices and procedures that may enhance the opportunity for discrimination aga inst Black Alabamians. 80. Alabama has a long history of employing voting procedures that increase the opportunity for discrimi- nation. 81. In 1875, the state passed a voter fraud measure that made multiple voting a felony. Democrats in the state legislature argued that Blacks, but not whites, were often guilty of voting \"e arly and often\" and that it 75 ABC News 2008 Democratic Primary Exit Poll Results, available at https://abcnews.go.com/im ages/PollingUnit/O8Dem PrimaryKeyGroups.pdf. 76 CNN Exit Polls: 2008 Alabama General Elec- tion, available at https://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/ pollsVALSOlpl. JA392 was an established fact that a white man cannot easily vote more than once at one election because whites \"do not all look alike.\"77 In 1876, the Alabama Legislature eliminated elections in eight Black Belt counties and authorized the Governor to appoint county commis- sioners. 82. As discussed, in 1957, the Alabama Legislature redrew the city boundaries of Tuskegee from a square shape to a 28-sided figure. The purpose of the new fig-ure was to carve out or excl ude the Black residents of Tuskegee, who threatened to increase their political participation after passage of the 1957 Civil Right Act and increasing Black registration. 83. The changing or creation of new jurisdiction boundaries in Tuskegee represents one of many in- stances in which geographic boundaries have been used to dilute the voting power or exclude Black Ala-bamians from public spaces . As another example, in 1980, the City of Valley was incorporated in Chambers County. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, \"the incorporation was especially motivated by the de- sire to create a separate city school system. That in- corporation defined an irregularly shaped city which included six schools intend ed for the Valley School Sys- tem, but which excluded sign ificant areas of Black pop- ulation concentration.\" 78 77 Montgomery Advertiser and Mail (March 3, 1875). 78 Blacksher, supra n.15 at 5. JA393 84. The shift from ward elections to at-large elections in counties represents another attempt on the part of whites in Alabama to limit the political power of Black Alabamians. When Barbour County changed from sin-gle-member districts to at large districts, Senator James S. Clark was quoted as saying that a reason for the change was to \"lessen the impact\" of a \"block vote,\" a term often used at the time in reference to the Black vote. 79 Following this, the Barbour County Democratic Party Executive Committee changed from ward-based to at-large districts for the party primary, despite the ruling in Smith v. Paris that the at-large districts vio- lated the Fifteenth Amendment. During the trial, the party acknowledged that the at-large elections had a discriminatory impact. 80 In the Dillard litigation over at-large elections in Alabama, the court explained: \"From the late 1800s throug h the present, the state has consistently erected barriers to keep Black persons from full and equal participation in the social, eco-nomic, and political life of the state.\" 640 F.Supp. 1347, 1360 (M.D. Ala. 1986). Because of this the court ex- panded the suit to include 17 county commissions, 28 county school boards, and 144 municipalities which were using racially motivated at-large voting rules. 81 After the initial Dillard decision many of the local ju- risdictions who were defendants in the class action suit changed from at-large to single member districts, some jurisdictions refused to enter consent decrees, 79 McCrary, supra , n.13 at 39 80 Id. 81 Blacksher, supra n.15 at 9. JA394 and others required extended trial proceedings and court ruling before the all-white governing bodies would agree to a consent decree.82 85. Although the Dillard decisions may have resulted in increased opportunities for representation for Black Americans in local governments, highly racialized vot-ing patterns persisted. An expert analysis of the 2004 general elec- tion for the seven members of the Chilton County, Alabama Commission, who, pursuant to a 1987 consent decree, are elected at-large using cumulative voting rules, provides dra- matic evidence of how white voters in Ala- bama remain unwilling to vote for Black candidates. Commissioner Bobby Agee, who is Black, has served cont inuously on the com- mission since 1988 and has earned the respect of his fellow commissioners. But even the power of incumbency and familiarity has earned him no support from the white elec- torate. 83 According to testimony, Mr. Agee, a longtime incumbent on the county commission, is the overwhelming choice of the African American voters. His support among African American voters in the county ranges, across the analyses, from an estimated 5.2 votes per voter to 5.6. He is the first choice of African American voters to represent them on 82 Id. at 15. 83 Id. at 277. JA395 the commission in every analysis. In contrast, his support among the non-African American voters is minimal.84 86. Until 2021, municipalities in Alabama continued to use at-large elections with numbered posts. In re- cent years, federal courts have struck down or altered these voting systems. See, e.g., Jones , 2019 WL 7500528, at *4; Ala. State Conf of the NA ACP v. City of Pleasant Grove , No. 2:18-cv-02056, 2019 WL 5172371, at *1 (N.D. Ala. Oct. 11, 2019). 87. In addition to at-large elections, the single shot provision applied in 1951 and the numbered place laws adopted in 1961, both discussed above, made it nearly impossible for Black voters to elect a Black candidate of their choice without substantial crossover voting by whites. 85 Senate Factor 5: Effects of Al abama's history of discrimination on Black Alabamians today. 88. There are many areas in Alabama where Black Americans disproportionately bear the negative effects of discrimination. These include education, economics, housing, criminal justice, and health. Disparities across these areas hinder Black Alabamians' ability to partic- ipate effectively in the political process. 84 Id. 85 McCrary, supra n.13 at 47. JA396 A. Education 89. Current racial educational discrepancies in Ala- bama are the result of the state's historical, intentional discrimination against Black Alabamians. During the 1901 constitutional convention, some convention dele- gates intentionally \"sought to deny [education] rights because they envisioned a futu re race war, in which ed- ucation would better equip Blacks to wage.\" This, cou- pled with the knowledge that Blacks within Alabama \"had the most to gain from p ublic services [such as] . . . public schools,\" the drafters of the 1901 Constitution set out to ensure that \"there was neither the will nor the money to provide such se rvices\" as they would \"dis- proportionately favor\" Blacks. 90. As such, the 1901 Constitution included a cap placed on the taxes that could be collected to fund state services such as public education. 86 The property tax cap, coupled with the fact that individual local govern- ments do not have the authority to increase their tax rates, has resulted in a system where poorer, less afflu-ent local governments perpetually have less to spend per pupil. 91. In Weissinger v. Boswell , 330 F.Supp. 615 (M.D. Ala. 1971), the court found that the assessment ratios were being applied unequall y across county lines, in vi- olation of the Equal Protecti on Clause of the Fourteenth 86 Harvey, T. I. (n.d.). Public sc hool finance programs of the Unites States and Canada:1998-99: Alabama. National Center for Educational Statistics. https://nces.ed.gov/ edfin/pdf/StFinance/ Alabama.pdf. JA397 Amendment. In response th e state adopted the Lid Bill which caps property tax rates. However, the cities of Mountain Brook, Vestavia Hills, Homewood, and Huntsville\u2014all of which are predominantly white\u2014are all exempt from the limits of the Lid Bill. 87 These school districts are also incidentally among the top- ranked school districts in student performance.88 92. A report by the Public Affairs Research Council of Alabama (\"PARCA\") finds that Alabama ranks 39th among the 50 states when it comes to per-pupil spend- ing on K-12 education. Further, according to data from the Alabama Department of Ed ucation, there is a wide disparity between spending in Alabama school sys- tems, ranging from over $12,000 per student in Moun- tain Brook to $7,615 per pupil in Autauga County. 89 Differences in local property values enable wealthier districts to spend more on education and potentially create unequal opportunities to learn.90 87 Mountain Brook is 97% white, Vestavia Hills is 88% white, Homewood is 78% white, and Huntsville is 61% white.

As discussed in greater detail below, Black Ala- bamians are more likely to live in poverty than their white counterparts. Thus, Black children in Alabama are more likely to live in poverty than their white peers and are more likely to find themselves in school sys- tems with significantly inadequate funding.91 94. Throughout the discipline of political science and public administration it is understood that interaction with public institutions c an produce \"spillover\" effects that can influence the likelihood of an individual par- ticipating politically. There is considerable scholarship that suggests that interactions with the education sys-tem and educational attainment affect political partic- ipation. 95. The transcendent power of education has been studied extensively; Black people who are more ed- ucated are more likely to participate in politics. 92 Considerable subsequent scholarship supports these initial findings.93 Voter+Priorities&utm_campaign=PARCA+2018&utm_medium= email. 91 Alabama Possible.

(1993) Mobilization, participation, and democracy in America. New York: Macmillan; Verba, S., Lehman Schlozman, JA399 96. According to political sc ientist Dr. Barry C. Bur- den, the connection between education and political participation can be divided into three categories. \"First, education provides people with the skills to make sense of the political world. Second, it makes it easier to navigate voter registration requirements and other impediments to voting. Third, classroom instruc-tion and social networks in which higher educated peo- ple are situated socialize a sense of civic duty and expose them to elite recruitment efforts.\" 94 97. Scholar Meghan Condon also suggests that the verbal skills that individuals acquire in school affect political participation in adulthood. 95 Namely, when young people learn to use their voices, they are more likely to speak up as participatory adults.96 98. There are other racial disparities in the education system, such as the degree of discipline exacted upon Black students compared to their white peers and ex- posure to educational enhancements.

JA400 disciplinary measures than white students for simi- lar offenses. Further, PARCA finds that while Black students comprise 33 percent of students in Alabama's public schools, they account for 60 percent of all re- ported disciplinary incidents. \"The proportion of Black students receiving out-of-school suspensions is mark- edly higher than for white students, who are more likely to receive the less seve re in-school suspensions.\" 97 Black students in Alabama ar e also more likely to re- ceive an out of school suspension than white students for the same infraction. 98 Being suspended or expelled increases the odds of dropping out of high school.99 99. Black children are also more likely than their white peers to be referred to law enforcement in 32 Al- abama school districts, a referral that can trigger a se-ries of events that can lead to a criminal record with lifelong consequences. 100 100.

JA401 3.7 times as likely to be suspended as white students.101 There are also racial disparities between Black and white students and their ability to access educational enhancement opportunities while in school. White students are 1.7 times more likely to be enrolled in advanced placement (AP) courses than their Black peers. 102 Black students are also less likely to be in- volved in gifted and talented programs when compared to their white peers.103 The study also finds that Black students who have been suspended or expelled are more likely to engage in criminal behavior than white students.104 This study concludes that, for Black stu- dents, the effect of being labeled \"a troublemaker\" in adolescence may have a strong influence on outcomes in adulthood. 105 101. Another scholar finds that the stigma associated with the label \"felon\" was s tronger for Blacks than whites.106 Black job applicants with a criminal record were the least likely to receive a call back for an 101 Groeger, L.V., Waldman, A.

Thus, when Black students are dispro- portionately removed from the classroom because of suspension and expulsion, ex isting health disparities are exacerbated.107 B. Economic Disparities 103. In addition to disparities in educational experi- ences between Black and white Alabamians, there are also economic disparities between racial groups in the state. In terms of employment, the unemployment rate for African American workers (4.6 percent) is twice that of White workers (2.5 percent). 108 Black Alabami- ans are almost twice as lik ely to be unemployed when compared to their white count erparts. This disparity in unemployment persists across all education levels.109 As an example, the unemployment rate for Black resi-dents with a Bachelors degree or higher is 5 percent, compared to 3 percent for comparable white residents. 107 Gonzalez, T., Etow, W., & De La Vega, C.

JA403 The unemployment rate for Blacks with less than a high school diploma is 24%, compared to 15% for com- parable whites. Similar disparities exist between Blacks and whites with a high school diploma, some college, and an Associate's degree. 104. In terms of earning power, according to the Na- tional Women's Law Center, Black women in Alabama typically make $0.59 for every dollar earned by their white male counterparts.110 105. Black Alabamians also experience poverty at more than twice the rate of whites. Indeed, the child poverty rate for Black Alabamians is 34.1%, while the same rate for white children is 13.2%. 111 As such a quarter of Black households in Alabama rely on food stamps, compared to only 8.2% of white households.) 112 106. The median household income of Black Alabam- ians is $35,900, nearly half the white median house- hold income of $59,966.113 107. Economic disparities, similar to disparities in ed- ucation, can affect the likelihood of an individual exer- cising their right to vote. Political science scholarship has demonstrated that voting is strongly correlated 110 Temple, B., & Tucker, J., National Women's Law Center, Equal Pay for Black Women , July 2017, available at https://nwlc. org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Equal-Pay-for-BlackWomen.pdf. 111 U.S. Census Bureau; Americ an Community Survey, 2019 American Community Survey 1-Ye ar Estimates, Table S0201. 112 Id. 113 Id. JA404 with income.114 This is particularly true in the United States.115 Galbraith and Hale find that individuals who live in states with high levels of income inequality are less likely to vote.116 108. Similar findings are reported by Macdonald, who finds that income inequality can demobilize voters but that the relationship is not consistent across elec- tions. 117 The effect of income inequality in lower partic- ipation is more evident in midterm election years when compared to presidential election years. 114 Verba, S., Lehman Schlozman, K., & Brady, H.

Felony disenfranchisement is \"the practice of re- moving the right to vote upon conviction for a felony level offense.\"118 These laws \"can be viewed as part of a larger movement to maintain control over access to the ballot following the gradual establishment of white male suffrage.\"119 Only four states had disenfranchise- ment laws prior to 1840, but between 1840 and the be- ginning of the Civil War, fourteen states adopted such laws.120 In the years that followed the Civil War, 11 more states passed such laws for the first time or broadened an existing law. The adoption or expansion of felony disenfranchisement laws across the southern states occurred alongside literacy tests and poll taxes. The expansion of disenfranchi sement laws included se- rious crimes like treason, but also minor crimes like vagrancy, petty larceny, miscegenation, bigamy and the receiving of stolen goods. These were crimes of which Black Americans were more likely to be accused, charged, and convicted. 121 Using the criminal code to 118 Manza, J. and Uggen, C. (2008).

Alabama originally adopted disenfranchisement for those convicted of \"vague acts of moral turpitude\" alongside the other voting restrictions in the 1901 Con- stitution discussed above. Du ring that convention, one proponent estimated that \"the crime of wife-beating alone would disqualify sixty percent of Negroes.\" 123 111. Historically, felony disenfranchisement has been an effective means of reducing the voting power of Black voters because of racially disparate incarcera- tion rates.124 In a review of state disenfranchisement laws from 1850-2002, scholars find that states with Felon disenfranchisement : Law, history, policy, and politics, 32 Fordham Urban Law Journal, 32, 101-148. 122 Reiman, Jeffrey (1995).

JA407 larger proportions of non-whites in prisons are more likely to pass restrictive felony disenfranchisement laws.125 To this point, two percent of Alabama's prison population was nonwhite in 1850 compared to 74 per-cent in 1870. 112. Because Alabama has significantly disparate in- carceration rates, the law has a largely disproportion- ate impact on Black voters. According to the September 2021 Alabama Department of Corrections Statistical Report, Black Alabamians make up more than half (53.3%) of the prison popula tion in the state; even though Black Americans are a little more than a quar-ter (26.8%) of the state population. White Alabamians, in spite being 69% of the po pulation, are only 45.9% of the prison population. 126 The incarceration rate in Ala- bama is 1,132 Black residents in prison per 100,000 Black residents in the state and 421 white residents in prison per 100,000 white residents in the state.127 113. These disparities make Alabama an outlier among other states. At the time of the 2020 presiden-tial election, 5.2 million or 2.27 percent of voting age individuals in the United States were unable to vote due to felony conviction.

JA408 Black Americans are disenf ranchised due to felony convictions, compared to just 8.94 percent of all voting- age Alabamians.128 The law disenfranchises more than one in seven Black Alabamians, twice the national av-erage. 129 114. Contemporary felony disenfranchisement laws in the United States can be divided into five catego- ries: no disenfranchisement; disenfranchisement in prison; disenfranchisement in prison and parole, dis-enfranchisement in prison, parole, and probation, disenfranchisement in pris on, parole, probation, and post-sentence for some or all offenses. Alabama falls into the latter category of disenfranchisement while under supervision and post-sentence for some crimes. 115. Prior to 2017, Alabama had no prescribed list of crimes that constituted \"moral turpitude\" and there- fore were disenfranchising. The result of this was a system where county registra rs would use their discre- tion on a case-by-case basis and make decisions about which crimes were moral turpitude and covered by sec-tion 182 of the 1901 Constitution. Although section 182 was struck down in Hunter v. Underwood , 471 U.S. 222 (1985), Amendment 579 was added to the Alabama Constitution in 1996. Unlike Section 182, Amendment 579 did not list the felonies an individual could be 128 Uggen, C. Larson, R., Shannon, S., & Pulido-Nava, A. (2020).

JA409 disenfranchised for but barred \"any person convicted of a crime of moral turpitude .\" This resulted in a sys- tem where a crime could be moral turpitude in one county and not moral turpitude in the another. This law was inconsistently applied and disproportionately disenfranchised African Americans. 130 116. In 2017 the Alabama State legislature passed the Moral Turpitude Act, which clarified the 47 felo- nies considered to be crimes of moral turpitude.131 A 2016 study that compared a list of all Alabamians whose voter registration had been cancelled or rejected because of a felony convict ion to the Alabama Criminal Records Database found t hat between 29,000 and 36,000 individuals who had been removed from voter rolls or denied registration were in fact eligible to vote under the Moral Turpitude Act because they had not been convicted of disqualifying offenses.132 117. Despite passage of the 2017 law clarifying which crimes are disenfranchising, there has been no effort on the part of the state to inform the thousands of Al-abamians who, prior to 2017 may have been told that they were ineligible due to their felony conviction(s), 130 Harvard Law Review.

Although the state has a process to acquire a Certificate of Eligibility to Register to Vote (\"CERV\") which restores the voting ri ghts for those with felony convictions, research sugge sts that the completion of the CERV for the restoration of voting rights is rare. In Alabama there have been approximately 3,493 vot- ing rights restorations from 2016 to 2020.134 In addi- tion to the loss of the right to vote, Alabama also denies those with felony convictions the ability to participate politically by holding office, even among those who have had their voting rights restored. 135 119. Who is drawn or welcomed into political life along with a citizen's goals, beliefs, and identity can all be affected by the policies and institutions that govern them. Felony disenfranchisement policies, especially those that disenfranchise citizens post-sentence for some or all felonies, limit or eliminate the ability of re- turning citizens to experience the full rights of citizen-ship, relegating them to a se cond-tier or second-class citizenship in which they have limited social, political, 133 Harvard Law Review, supra n.130. 134 Id. 135 Alabama Code \u00a736-2-1; Sylacauga News.

The Census Bureau counts incarcerated people as residents of the towns where they are confined. Alt- hough some states adjust the Census counts to place incarcerated individuals in th eir home districts for re- districting, Alabama is one of the many states that does not. This practice of counting incarcerated indi-viduals where they are inca rcerated as opposed to their last known home address is known as \"prison ger- rymandering.\" Once convicted and sentenced to prison, individuals are, on average, incarcerated more than 100 miles away from their homes. Only about 36 per- cent of incarcerated persons reside in pri sons less than 100 miles from their previous address. 137 Thus, the pro- cess of prison gerrymandering moves political power from one region of the state to another. 136 Mettler, S., & Soss, J.

JA412 121. Although some Alabama counties adjust the Census counts, many do not.138 Given this, there are several counties in Alabama wi th large prison popula- tions relative to the actual population. In these coun-ties there are districts whose populations are inflated with non-resident inmates. 139 As an example, \"in Bibb County the prison population from Bibb Correctional Facility was included as part of a commission district population. As a result, 21% of the 5th district is incar- cerated. In terms of voting power, every 79 residents in District 5 have as much political power as 100 resi- dents in other non-prison districts. Other counties, in- cluding Talladega County and Coosa County, use the prison population to pad their districts, as well.\" 140 122. In the 2010 Census, more than 34,000 Alabama residents were counted in the wrong place because the Census Bureau treats prisons as if they are residential homes.141 138 Escambia County, for example, removes the incarcerated population before county commissioner lines are drawn.

Health Insurance and Health Outcome Dis- parities 123. Black Alabamians also ex perience inequity in access to healthcare and health outcomes. 19 percent of African Americans are uninsured compared to 12.9 percent of their white counterparts. 142 Further, because African Americans tend to live in poorer communities in Alabama, they have less access to healthcare ser-vices, and have higher in stances of chronic disease. 143 The infant mortality rate is more than two times higher among African American infants (13.4%) than Caucasian (6.5%). 144 124. Black women in Alabama have significantly higher rates of breast cancer incidence than white women in Alabama. This is unique because in the whole United States, white women have significantly higher breast cancer incidence rates than Black women. White males in Alabama have approximately the same incidence and mortality rates for prostate cancer as the average American white male, while Black males in Alabama have both higher incidence 142 Alabama Public Health (n.d.).

In Alabama, Black residents are significantly more likely to have and die from diabetes and stroke than white residents.146 126. Quality of health and access to healthcare can also influence voting and reduce electoral participa- tion. For example, poor health reduces the likelihood that low-income citizens will vote while high-income citizens continue to turnout to vote regardless of their underlying health conditions. 147 127. Evaluating the effect of Medicaid expansion on voter turnout for low-income citizens, Haselswerdt finds that the increases in Medicaid enrollment that occur as a consequence of Medicaid expansion are related to higher voter turnout in those states. Hasel-werdt suggests that these increases, in part, are a re- sult of increases in participation among new Medicaid 145 Alabama Public Health. ( 2019).

Specifically, Haselw erdt evaluates the rela- tionship between Medicaid expansion in the states and voter turnout in 2012 and 2014 United State House of Representatives races. Haselwerdt finds that relative to the 2012 election, voter turnout in 2014 increased in those states that implemented Medicaid expan- sion through the ACA. 148 This finding is particularly noteworthy because increases in Medicaid enrollment are generally associated with decreased voter turn- out.149 Alabama is one of the 12 states that has not ex- panded Medicaid. Senate Factor 6: Overt and subtle racial appeals in Alabama campaigns. 128. Overt and subtle racist appeals have been used throughout the state's history to persuade or dissuade Alabama voters from voting for certain candidates for political office and ballot measures. Similar language has been used by elected officials to persuade or dis-suade their peers in supporting or opposing legislation. 129.

Knox's opening address, stated In my judgment, the people of Alabama have been called upon to face no more important situation than now confronts us, unless it be when they, in 1861, stirred by the momentous issues of impending conflict between the North and the South, were forced to decide whether they would remain in or withdraw from the Union. Then, as now, the negro was the prominent factor in the issue. 150 He then goes on to say, \"And what is it that we want to do? Why, it is, within the lim its imposed by the Federal Constitution, to establish white supremacy in this State.\" 151 130. In the Twentieth Century, Alabama was a pri- mary target of the Southern Strategy. Initially adopted by Barry Goldwater, the Southern Strategy \"dictated a posture of benign neglect toward the aspirations of Black America.\" 152 During the Civil Rights Movement, the Southern Strategy relied on appeals to racism 150 Alabama Constitutional Convention (1901).

JA417 against African Americans, to gain the support of white voters in the south, particularly those that had traditionally supported the Democratic Party. The Southern Strategy appealed to the racial grievances of white Southerners to gain their political support in electoral contests. The Southern Strategy was also used by Democrats in the so uth to separate their polit- ical ideals from Democrats in the North. 153 131. Governor George Wallace, a Southern Democrat and staunch segregationist who was elected during the Civil Rights Era, during his inauguration speech for Governor in January 1963 stated, Today I have stood, where once Jefferson Da- vis stood, and took an oath to my people. It is very appropriate then that from this Cradle of the Confederacy, this ve ry Heart of the Great Anglo-Saxon Southland, that today we sound the drum for freedom as have our generations of forebears before us done, time and time again through history.

Martin Luther King described Wallace as, \"per- haps the most dangerous racist in America today.\" In a 1965 interview King also stated, \"I am not sure that he believes all the poison that he preaches, but he is artful enough to convince others that he does.\"154 Whether he believed the rhetoric or not, for Wallace, the strategy was successful not only in Alabama but also across the county when he ran for president in 1968 as an inde- pendent as he was able to demonstrate that there were millions of angry whites who were willing to vote for a \"vulgar racist whose policy proposals were scarcely more than slogans.\" 155 133. Although it has evolved, the use of racist rheto- ric and imagery has remained a tool that is used by political candidates in Alabama to this day. The use of more subtle imagery and co ded language in contempo- rary political campaigns is what Maxwell might refer to as a part of \"the Long Southern Strategy,\" a strategy that modifies racial language and imagery in a way that fits the political and social moment. 156 154 Wallace, George Corely, Jr. (n .d.)

JA422 Senate Factor 7: Underrepresentation of Black Alabamians in electoral office. 141. During Reconstruction and prior to the adoption of the 1901 constitution, Black Alabamians experi- enced some representation in the State Legislature. In 1868, there was one Black man elected to the Alabama senate and 30 in the Alabama House of Representa- tives. While the number of Black members of the Ala-bama House of Representatives remained stable until 1876, there were increases in the Alabama Senate. In 1874, there were six Blac k members in the Alabama Senate. 142. These electoral and representative victories, however, were short-lived . By 1876, there were no Black members of the Alabama Senate and the num- ber of Black members of the Alabama House of Repre-sentatives decreased to ten in 1876, and then to two in 1878. 166 143. In addition to the disenf ranchising e ffect of the policies enacted after Reconstruction discussed at length above, the decline and lack of Black representa-tion in the Alabama Legislature during this period can also be understood by considering that no redistricting was conducted in the state between the adoption of the 1901 constitution until the 1960s. While the disen- franchising 1901 Alabama Constitution called for the 166 Alabama Archives. (1997).

JA423 Legislature to redistrict after every decennial census, this mandate was ignored. As a result, the original 1901 House and Senate boundaries were still in place even after publication of the 1960 Census. 144. It was not until 1970 when, following federal in- tervention, two Black candidates were finally elected to the Alabama Legislature, the first since Reconstruc- tion. In the first election following the 1980 Census, seventeen Blacks were elected to the House and three to the Senate. 167 The election of Black Americans to seats in the Alabama Legislature during this time was the direct result of the cre ation of majority-minority districts. In both chambe rs, the change to single mem- ber districts created new opportunities for Black Ala- bamians to elect Black candidates. Following the passage of the VRA in 1965, the Alabama Senate grew from zero Black state se nators to five by 1985. While the House of Representatives had no Black members in 1965, by 1985 it had 19. 168 These Black candidates were elected by majority-minority districts; none came from predominantly white districts.169 145. Due to white bloc voting against Black candi- dates, only two Black candidates have been elected to statewide office in the entire history of Alabama (Oscar Adams and Ralph Cook), both to the Alabama Supreme 167 Blacksher, supra n.15. 168 Grofman, B., & Handley, L.

But for one Black representative, all of th ese Black legislators are elected in majority-Black districts. 147.

There are various areas where Alabama has had the opportunity, but failed, to act in a way that would have substantially benefitted the lives of Black Ala- bamians. Two examples are (1) the expansion of Med- icaid and (2) felony disenfranchisement.
