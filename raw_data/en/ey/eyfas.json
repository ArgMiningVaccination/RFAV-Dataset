Research shows that acupuncture is beneficial in treating a variety of health conditions. Traditional Chinese Medicine theorizes that there are more than 2,000 acupuncture points on the human body, and that these connect with pathways called meridians, conducting energy (qi) throughout the body.\" Source: [National Center for Complementary & Alternative Medicine](http://nccam.nih.gov/), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) About acupuncture In acupuncture, fine disposable needles are inserted at critical points in the body that connect nerves, muscles and organs.
