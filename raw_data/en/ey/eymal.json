First, I would like to congratulate the authors for their extensive and thorough work on this update for the safety of vaccines used for routine immunization in the United States. The update has addressed many important evidence gaps. From the statistical perspective, here are a few comments [see rows below] Thank you Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 3 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response Peer Reviewer #1 General 1) While Hartung -Knapp -Sidik - Jonkman approach and its modification for random -effects meta - analysis is becoming advocated for general use for a meta- analysis (with few studies), there is a range of potential concerns (see Jackson et al.1). When the outcome is binar y, the Hartung- Knapp- Sidik -Jonkman approach is a two- step approach. For example, when the effect measure of interests is RR, it first computes log(RR) and its standard error for each study; when there is zero cells, some continuity correction is implemented. Then it applies that the Hartung- Knapp- Sidik -Jonkman approach to combine log(RR) from all studies. Given that for many adverse events only a small number of studies was available, many studies reported zero events as many adverse events are rare, this approach is not optimal as it does not directly use binomial likelihood and need some ad hoc continuity corrections for zero cells. There is a wide range of literature available on meta- analysis with zero events, and none of them seems to be cited in the re ference list. We have specifically selected our approach to address the small number of studies. We also agree that the H artung- Knapp- Sidik - Jonkman (H K) approach needs a modification to address the issues raised by Jackson et al. and have used a modificati on recently implemented in the metafor package in R. We have added a citation specific to zero events to address this comment and have added more details how we have addressed zero events.

We believe that our approach is more suitable to the 400+ meta- analyses undertaken for this report. We do not believe that a different model will come to different conclusion, in particular given the rare nature of events and the often inadequate samples. Peer Reviewer #1 General 3) For the outcomes with sufficient number of studies to perform meta- analysis, the authors might consider using forest and other plots to visually present the data and results Thank you. We considered including forest plots, however because of the number of analyses (400+) and th e length of this report (1200 pages) we have decided not to include them as we believe they are of limited value . Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 5 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response Peer Reviewer #1 General 4) In addition to RR, the authors may consider presenting the absolute risks (and risk differences) of adverse events for vaccinated versus not vaccinated. It may be more useful for decision making and for the general audience to understand the risks of adverse events. While we generally agree, none of the new risk estimates in this report are statistically significant . Therefore, addition of absolute risks would provide information of limited value. In addition, for some risk estimates , the data is not reported in such a way that permits us to calculate the absolute risk. However, we do provide all rates of key adverse events in the Summary of Findings tables. We also provide the rates of key adverse events in the main text whenever the confidence intervals around the risk estimate were wide, as well as contextual information to help interpret t he rates (e.g., were the events attributed to the vaccine or not). Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 6 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response Peer Reviewer #2 General This overview presents an enormous amount of information and reflects considerable work by the authors who should be recognized for their efforts. Two major comments: First, the paper discusses adverse events which is appropriate given the title. However, suggest more discussion of the enormous benefit of vaccines. Note that no vaccine is 100% safe. But the overwhelming benefit of vaccines far exceeds any risk. Risk is present with anything we do, from eating to crossing the road. The issue is relative risk. We agree that the effectiveness of vaccines is an important counterpoint to the risk of vaccines, and that all decisions about vaccines must be made in the cont ext of both the safety and effectiveness. However, the effectiveness of vaccines is beyond the scope of this review. In order to address and acknowledge this important point, we have added some text to the discussion, noting that the risks of rare adverse events should be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide. Peer Reviewer #2 General Second, individual vaccines are discussed in separate sections throughout the text. It is difficult to address the issue of reported adverse events for an individual vaccine. Would an index be possible? We have updated the Table of Contents to include sub- headings for each vaccine. In addition, the summary tables are also already organized by vaccine and provide an easy means of accessing findings by vaccine . Finally, we have reorganized some sub- sections to merge information about vaccines so that it is easier for the reader. Peer Reviewer #2 General This reference by Meissner, Plotkin addresses the issue \"The facts about vaccine safety\" Clin Inf Dis 2020 10.1093/cid/ciaa697. Other possible sites are Discussion on page 27. We have added this reference to the portion of text where we highlight that effectiveness of vaccines must be weighed against risk in decision making.

Thank you for this extensive and detailed work on such an important topic. In general, the report is carefully done, well -organized, and well -written. I have several general comments, followed by several more specific or detailed ones. Thank you Peer Reviewer #3 General 2. It is not always clear when the referenced data comes from pre- licensure vs. post -licensure data. Often the terms \"RCT\" or \"trial\" are used, and I suspect these were mainly pre-licensure. And a related but arguably more impor tant point: whenever possible, please try to include what the comparator was for the RCTs whenever possible (seems present in most but not all references to RCT results). We have reviewed the report to ensure that we use only the terms \"RCT\" or \"trial\" to be consistent. Most RCTs were conducted pre- licensure. We note the comparator in each study in the evidence tables in Appendix D. We have also ensured that we note the comparator in the main body of the report when it was an active comparator (e.g., a comparator vaccine). Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 8 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response Peer Reviewer #3 General 3. Each Key Question asked about the short -term and long- term safety. Yet almost all that followed (text and summary tables) did not make any reference or distinction regarding whether the adverse event under study was monitored over a shorter or longer interval. Organizationally, where would this best fit? One could consider adding a section (\"short term vs. long term safety\") to each major text section. Or adding a column to most evidence tables? We col lected all adverse events based on the longest follow -up available to ensure we captured as complete safety data as possible. The exact follow -up for each study is stated in the evidence tables in Appendix D. We now also note the proportion of the studies that provided short -term follow -up (42 days or less) in the beginning of the Results section. Finally, we have added a sentence to the Discussion acknowledging that the timing of events was not always optimally reported. Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 9 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response Peer Reviewer #3 General 4. Related to above, some adverse events (anaphylaxis) are much more important to study in the short term, others in the long term (multiple sclerosis), whereas others may be important in both time frames (myocardial infarctions?) We agree that the ti ming of each adverse event relates to the vaccine and particular adverse event. We collected all adverse events based on the longest follow -up available to ensure we captured as complete safety data as possible. The adverse events were selected with the help of content experts, and were not distinguished by the timeframe in which they would be expected to occur. Had any of the associations been significant, we would have provided more detail in terms of the timing of the events, etc. However, such detail at a study level or even vaccine/adverse event level would make the report even more lengthy. Peer Reviewer #3 General 5. Why is there a distinction made between \"collected in\" and \"reported in\" outcomes? \"Collected in\" refers to which adverse events w ere planned to be collected, or were reported as having been collected by the authors. \"Reported in\" means that there was documentation of the presence or absence of the event. We have clarified this in the Methods section of the report (under Key Question s).

I certainly appreciate the challenges in conveying the state of knowledge clearly and concisely. But I found phrases such as \"low SoE for no evidence of increased risk\" a bit problematic. It represents something of a t riple negative. An alternative risk - first phrasing could be something like \"no increase in risk detected (low strength of evidence)\" We appreciate this comment and acknowledge that this is a complex phrasing. However, we feel strongly that we should continue to use the accurate, conservative phrasing currently in the report. We have, however, clarified the usage of this phrasing in the report to ensure that the rationale for its use is clear (see the Note for each Table in the Executive Summary ). Peer Reviewer #3 General 7. Is it true that findings from an individual study would always be regarded as \"insufficient evidence\" of an adverse event, if no other studies were available or an individual study could not be combined with others into a meta- analysis (such as for MMRV vaccines and febrile seizure risk)? We applied the outlined criteria to downgrade the strength of evidence also for single studies. Single studies were not considered insufficient evidence per se. Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 11 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response Peer Reviewer #3 General 8. The authors combined studies where comparators differed. While the approach may be justified, could the authors expand on their discussion of the limitations and strengths of this approach? We have expanded on the limitations and strengths of this approach in the Discussion section. Specifically, we note that a comparison between a vaccine and an active comparator may underestimate rate of adverse effects relative to a comparison between that same vaccine and placebo. Given this, we clearly note when an active vaccine comparator was used throughout the text of this report . While our inclusive approach added to the complexity of the review, this approach has the benefit of capturing the fullest evidence base possible for the range of vaccines and potential harms. Peer Reviewer #3 General 9. There is an important discussion of the limitations of self -controlled case series analys es (Page 132). Does the fact that results from self - controlled case series analyses cannot be combined with results from other study designs (RCT, cohort) lessen their contribution to the body of safety literature? We do not believe that the inability to combine these results with other study designs lessens their contribution to the body of safety literature. Although we could not combine such events numerically, we still took all studies available into account when determining the strength of evidence of a finding. Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 12 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response Peer Reviewer #3 General 10. There is no discussion (pages 125-135) of the important distinction between short -term and long- term safety data. Understandably, more is known about short -term safety. However, vaccine- hesitant parents and adults are often more concerned about long- term safety, including risk of chronic disease. We collected all adverse events based on the longest follow -up available to ensure we captured safety data as completely as possible, and in part to address concerns about long- term safety. In fact, the majority of studies had long- term follow -up (>42 days) for serious adverse events , with some following patients for years . The exact follow - up duration is stated in the evidence tables in Appendix D. We now also note t he proportion of the studies that provided long- term (>42 versus short - term follow -up in the beginning of the Results section. Peer Reviewer #4 General Yes, this report is clinically meaningful. The target populations and audience are explicitly defined, and the key questions are appropriate and explicitly stated. Thank you Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 13 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response Peer Reviewer #5 General The report is very thorough, providing useful information in multiple formats to relate to different audiences. Summaries are provided regularly and then foll owed by source data for those who want all of the details. The Evidence Summary provides a valuable overview of new information since the last report in 2014. At first, I was a bit overwhelmed by the size of the report and the level of detail included for the studies that were taken into consideration. If I were reading this for informational purposes, I think I would probably tackle it by vaccine and really dig in on the results. The organizational structure (by pathogen/vaccine) is particularly helpful for those looking for details on vaccines for a particular infectious disease. Thank you Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 14 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response Peer Reviewer #6 General This report is significantly clinically meaningful and comprehensive. The target populations and audiences are defined and presented per each vaccine. However, since adolescents are explicitly mentioned it may be helpful to explicitly mention the age range of this designation. To adolescent health professionals adolescent healthcare includes young adults and generally extends from age 11 to age 24 or 26. Given my experience in vaccine schedules I understand that ACIP adult vaccination schedules are generally from age 19 and older while children and adolescents schedules are 18 years old and younger. I suspect some of the studies reviewed considered adults to be individuals 18 years of age and older. There could be some clarity around the distinctions betw een the consideration of adolescents and adults in this report and in the studies reviewed. We agree that there is some variation in how \"adults\" are defined. As noted, ACIP considers adults to be those 19 and older, and children (including adolescents) to be 18 and younger. However, functionally in almost all reviewed studies, adults are considered those who are 18 and older. We have revised the methods to simplify the terminology and now make clear that the term \"children\" throughout the report includes adolescents as well. Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 15 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response Peer Reviewer #6 General The key questions are explicitly stated and are appropriate. Answers are specifically given for each key question under the designated subsection. This review is not only important for its intended audience, but it can also be easily translated for a lay audience. This should be considered in dissem ination strategies as there are growing concerns about vaccine safety among anti -vaxers and others concerned about COVID vaccination. Thank you TEP #1 General This a nice review of the available evidence regarding vaccine safety. It is a clinically meanin gful report that will be valuable to clinicians, researchers and healthcare organizations interested in vaccine safety. The key questions were appropriate and explicitly stated. Thank you Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 16 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response TEP #2 General This is a comprehensive document providing updates t o the safety of the range of vaccines for children, adults and pregnant woman. It serves as a critical reference document where information can easily be accessed in the summary tables providing the strength of the evidence each potential key adverse event . Its availability should be widely publicized with targeted communication to public health vaccination programs as well as clinicians. Thank you TEP #3 General This is a comprehensive report that exhaustively and systematically reviews the evidence for possible associations between specific vaccines and specific adverse events. It will be of value to scientists, clinicians and policy makers who deal with vaccines in general and vaccine safety in particular. I have some specific comments in t he attached pdf file. Thank you TEP #4 General Excellent review that is clinically meaningful, thorough, thoughtful. KQ easily identified, appropriate, and explicitly stated. Target populations clearly identified. Thank you Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 17 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response TEP #5 General Throughout the report, the term \"no evidence of increased risk\" is used. The report indicates that this phrase means that the \"reviewed studies did not constitute evidence of an increased risk of the adverse event.\" This term could be misleading, as it could be interpret ed in multiple ways. It is preferable to use a term or terms that better articulate that the weight of the evidence, based on the specific analyses that were conducted, did not definitively support an increased risk following vaccination. Thank you for not ing this. We carefully considered the most conservative and correct wording to express certainty in risk of an adverse event. The EPC Program's strength of assessment also uses this phrasing. As this phrasing is used throughout the EPC Program, we use it here for consistency'. However, to make the findings clearer to the reader, we have also added color - coded symbols to the tables summarizing findings to more easily identify where there were signals for increased risk versus no increased risk (or insufficient evidence to draw conclusions). TEP #5 General A clear and upfront explanation of the difference between insufficient evidence and the different grades of SoE is recommended, as it is not readily apparent from the descriptions of events assigned to either of these categories in the report. It is import ant that the terms used to inform results and conclusions accurately capture the nature of the analyses performed. Thank you - we have added an explanation of the different grades of SoE to the Executive Summary. Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 18 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response TEP #5 General This report leans heavily on the use of confidence intervals (CI) in the assessment of the study data. The report states that: \"there remains insufficient evidence for some rare potential adverse events for which very large samples would be needed to estimate the risk or to definit ively exclude a risk of such adverse events.\" It would be helpful to clearly describe the limitations of the use of the CI to assess rare events in studies that are inadequately powered or designed to detect statistically significant differences and to des cribe how the analysis of \"increased risk\" may not be as useful for such events. The statistical significance of risk comparisons of rare events may be less relevant than an examination of the specific cases for causality. We agree with this comment. We have added more context as appropriate for risk estimates with wide confidence intervals by including absolute rates of the rare adverse events in the studies in the main text and additional information to help interpret these rates (e.g., whether the event was attributed to the vaccine or not). Finally, we have also added some text to the Discussion around the use of CI and rare events. TEP #5 General Additionally, the methods used to combine studies and statistically analyze the results (such as the CI) are not clearly explicated in the report, and likely pose some methodologic limitations that should be clearly discussed, as this may impact the interpretation of this data in the context of the categories used. The full methods can be found in Appendix A. We have also added some text to the discussion around the interpretation of CI for rare events. Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 19 Commentator & Affiliation Section Comment Response TEP #6 General Would suggest adding information on SARS- CoV2 as this will likely be relevant to many readers. Recognize that the data is limited, but would acknowledge the vaccines and potentially share available information. Thank you for this comment. The SARS- CoV2 vaccines in development and under consideration do not meet inclusion criteria as they are not currently routinely recommended. This has been clarified throughout the report (including in the Executive Summary).

The statistical methods seem to be appropriate although this is not my area of expertise. Thank you TEP #3 Methods All of the above criteria are met. The methods lean heavily on clinical trials, which is justifiable, but nonetheless leads to prioritizing studies of rather limited sample size for many of the rare adverse events evaluated. Thank you. We included all studies that met inclusion criteria, which also included non- trial studies (e.g., self - controlled designs). TEP #4 Methods The key questions are clearly identified and are clinically relevant. The create an appropriate framework for the report. Target populations clearly identified. Thank you TEP #4 Methods Inclusion and exclusion criteria are appropriate. I feel it would add clarity if the Table A.1 (eligibility criteria) was included in the document rather than as an appendix. It is a quick and easy to read summation of the eligibility criteria . This is often the first thing I look at with systematic reviews to determine if I would keep reading further. We carefully considered this thoughtful comment within our team, but given the straightforward inclusion criteria and the existence of the tabl e of included vaccines in the introduction, we did not add this table on top of the brief summary of inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Including the evidence tables was extremely valuable, though I could not easily find the bias assessments for the included studies. Thank you for noting this. A summary of the bias assessment is in Figure 6. Because we did an extensive risk of bias assessment, we also include documentation of each source of bias for each study in a separate table in Appendix C (Table C.5). TEP #3 Methods [Comment in pdf file on \"KQ1a. What adverse events are collected in clinical studies (Phases I -IV) and in observational studies containing a control/comparison group?\", p.6]: Comment: May miss important studies that employ a self -control design. We included studies that employ a self-control design, and have clarified this in the Methods. TEP #6 Methods Key Question 2, p 7. Would clarify why we chose 42 rather than 30 days. Because this report is an update of the prior AHRQ 2014 report, the key questions remained the same. In the prior report, 42 days was the cut -off between short - and long -term. Peer Reviewer #2 Methods [Comment on \"We included trial records, even in the absence of a corresponding publication, from which we abstracted severe and serious adverse events, as well as deaths.\" P. 9] Comment: Page 36, line 42, how could you include vaccine trials that were not published? How did you identify them? Doesn't seem appropriate. We included data from entries on clinicaltrials.gov, which contains data often prior to publication or that were not published in a journal (if published, we ensured that such results were only included once).

TEP #4 Methods Page 32, Line 9: This sentence discusses evaluating risk fac tors for adverse events and includes race/ethnicity. As we work to move away from race based medicine, a brief recognition that race is not a risk factor (because it is not a biologically distinct entity) but rather racism and social determinants of healt h equity are a risk factor that may manifest as differences in outcomes based on race is warranted. We have added some text to the Methods (under Analytic Framework) to acknowledge this very important point in the report, in part using the wording suggested.

The investigators did a comprehensive search to include additional studies from the first review. The information presented at times seems repetitive. One suggestion for consideration is to perhaps organize all of the information for each vaccine in its own section with subheadings for the adverse events that were collected, those that were reported, and those associated by number and severity , statistical significance, and risk factors. Rather than listing information for each of the vaccines under each of these sections. So that all of the information about a single vaccine I presented in one place. We appreciate this suggestion and discussed it. Ultimately, we have opted to retain the structure so that it follows the Key Questions.

Are these results reported in peer reviewed journals, or from the vaccine package inserts, or another source? Thank you for this observa tion. In general, we include all results if published, including if they are published online as part of clinicaltrials.gov. Wherever possible, we cite the paper that is published from the trial. In some cases, no paper is published, as happened with reference 74, which is of one of the trials of HEPLISAV- B. The effectiveness results were published, as were safety results in a subset of adults with diabetes aged 60- 70 years. However, the full safety results are available only in the clinical trial record, and this is what we used for data abstraction. Reference 88 is also a clinical trial record for HEPLISAV -B that was not published as a paper. Again, to present a complete picture of the safety of the vaccine we abstracted data directly from clinicaltrials. gov. References 212 and 213 are the trial records for other papers and are cited in the literature flow and are considered \"multiple publications\" (meaning they are reviewed, but when citing results relevant to the trial, we always cite the main paper if one was published).

Page 66: With respect to reference 111 (and this comment also applies to other safety studies cited in this review), my understanding is that risk interval designs produce results that have a strength of evidence and internal validity similar to that of other observational designs (such as case- control or cohort). The safety findings from reference 111 are described, but then excluded because \"they were not assessed with a comparator.\" But my understanding is that a comparator is present, a different observation interval within the same individual. In the instance of this particular study, there was no elevated risk detected but without any sort of comparator, including to an exposure window. Because of this, the authors did not further analyze these outcomes in the self -controlled risk interval design and there was no comparator. However, in general, studies of self -controlled design are included in our report, and the comparator is the different observation interval within the same individual. We cannot combine results from such designs into our RR analyses unless the study provides both a numerator of the subjects who experienced the adverse event and a denominator of subjects in each arm. In such studies, typically the denominator was person- days, which made it impossible to combine numerically. However, we still include these studies in our strength of evidence assessment.

Page 91: It appears that the strengt h of evidence regarding MMR vaccine and febrile seizures was downgraded due to one study reporting no evidence of increased risk. Was that a study of febrile seizures 0- 1 day following vaccination? If so, that doesn't refute a finding that MMR vaccine can cause febrile seizures 7- 10 days following vaccination (because of timing of replication of a live virus vaccine). We re -reviewed all evidence around MMR and febrile seizures. We considered this study to be insufficient evidence. This, along with insufficient evidence for increased risk of seizures based on studies added from our search update (presumed largely to be primarily febrile seizures), means that we no longer downgrade the finding from the prior 2014 report. The finding across both reports for the risk of MMR and febrile seizures is high SoE for increased risk.

The risk of febrile seizures following influenza and 13- valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Vaccine 2020. 38:2166- 2171). The other studies already identifi ed in the current report do not suggest an increased risk of febrile seizures. We have expanded our discussion of PCV13 and febrile seizures in the text. In addition, we re- reviewed all evidence and downgraded the strength of evidence from moderate to low SoE of increased risk (rather than moderate SoE of no increased risk). Thus, across the prior report and this update, there is low SoE of increased risk of febrile seizures following PCV13. Peer Reviewer #5 Results p. 99, line 48.

Bradycardia in a premature infant is fundamentally different from other types of cardiovascular events (in fact, it is more a neurologic than a cardiovascular event in pathophysiology, I believe). Thank you for this comment - for now we will keep it with cardiovascular events, but we have now added text to interpret it for the reader both directly in the table, as well as in the main Results text . This is text is intended to ensure that it is clear there is heterogeneity in the events reported, and that the effect estimate is driven by the study.

Optimally timed Tdap was associated with significantly lower risk of preeclampsia/eclampsia (aHR 0.96: 0.94, 0.99), but early Tdap was not (aHR 1.05; CI 0.99, 1.12). Overall , early administration of Tdap was safe except for the slightly increased risk of premature rupture of membranes. However, it is possible that the study failed to adjust for all residual confounding, and that receipt of the Tdap vaccine prior to the recomm ended timing might have been a proxy for atypical care or anticipated premature birth. The study provides an aHR which is slightly different than what is in the paper. It's unclear why this finding, which is a very small difference, results in a statement of \"safe except for.\" Is there something particular about this finding that is concerning? The biologically plausible mechanism whereby temporal distance is more associated with a mechanical rupture of membranes than temporal proximity is unclear. We have revised the text to avoid the use of the wording \"safe except for\", and also expanded the discussion in this portion of the report to note that the biological plausibility of this mechanism (and particularly the temporal aspect) is unclear.

This was a limitation of the studies in the review. There were some inferences made by race and ethnicity. It may be helpful to add a sentence or two about race as a social construct that may more related to social determinants of health. Another limitation that could have been discussed in more detail is that all immunizations may not have been captured particularly if they occurred outside of the medical home and/or if the state doesn't have a vaccine registry. Of note statewide registries for adults are much less common than they are for children. Adults are also more likely to get their vaccines at alternate places such as at their workplace or at pharmacies.

It does not appear that any important literature has been overlooked. There is no section describing as how these finding could be translated into new research. It is suggested that this type of review be extended to safety considerations in the 65 and older population where adverse events are more likely to affect the performance of activities of daily living.

For example, in many examples in the documents it is stated: No evidence of risk but is also associated with low SoE. The level of certainty is not there to support strength of association based on SoE for the patient/HCP to make a decision.

I applaud this systematic review, BUT .... I fear that this well - done systematic review paper will be a mere academic exercise with no practical impact. These messages about low rates of adverse events and a significant benefit of routine immunizations are simply NOT getting through to a large segment of the general public. About 25% of my patients' families (children with chronic illness) in the past month refused influenza vaccine because they think that the risk/benefit ratio is not worthwhile. They cite the opinions of neighbors, relatives, TV talk shows, social media, etc. about the horrible side effects and lack of efficacy of influenza vaccines and only get the ones that we say are required for school or required for their chronic disease. Please invest in packaging this scientific paper for a publicity campaign of dissemination in lay language and infographics and memorable stories, to use social media, popular media like talk shows, prime -time commercials, and trusted community leaders in minority groups.

Overall, I found the review very reassuring. I strongly recommend that you add a handout for practicing clinicians that hits the high points to share with patients. In this era of anti - vaxers, it is critical that we provide support for those at the point of care. The handout should have sections specific to pregnancy, to low weight infants and highlight any warnings and advisements. For example, for low weight babies, although there are some risks to the rotatvirus vaccination, these are babies most at risk from failure to be immunized.

AIRA is a national membership organization that promotes the development and implementation of immunization information systems (IIS) as an important tool in preventing and controlling vaccine- preventable diseases. IIS, also known as immunization registries, are confidential, population-based, computerized databases that record all immunization dos es administered by participating providers to persons residing within a given geopolitical area. At the point of clinical care, an IIS can provide consolidated immunization records and a forecast for immunizations due for use by a vaccination provider in determining appropriate client vaccinations.

In addition to serving as a reliable source for timely, accurate, and complete data for assessing vaccination coverage, IIS are an important data source for studies evaluating vaccine safety. Multiple evaluations of adverse events have relied on IIS vaccine administration data to assess the potential association of vaccine exposure with various outcomes of interest for safety investigations. For example, the Post - Licensure Rapid Immunization Safety Moni toring (PRISM) program and Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) have both linked to IIS for more complete immunization data as part of studies assessing the safety of H1N1 vaccine.1 IIS also house important details on the vaccine products administered, such as manufacturer and lot number facilitating timely response in the case of safety scares related to the vaccine product that need to be acted on. AIRA commends this effort to carry out such an extensive review of the safety of vaccines across the lifespan. As the US prepares to introduce numerous novel vaccines utilizing new Source: https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/products/safety -vaccines/research Published Online: May 25, 2021 95 vaccine technologies to respond to the COVID- 19 pandemic, proving these vaccines are safe is imperative to the success of the mass vaccination campaign and maintaining confidence in all va ccines. Given the variability in strategies used to assess safety as demonstrated in your review, we would like to take this opportunity to call attention to a potential need to evaluate the methods in which vaccine safety is being monitored across the US and to consider opportunities to standardize and modernize these efforts. It may be possible that IIS data can be leveraged on a larger scale to support rapid, population- level studies. For example, IIS could be used to verify what type of COVID vaccine a person received should there be an adverse event. It can also be used to review a person's comprehensive vaccination record. There might be a need to evaluate safety and/or efficacy with co-administered vaccines (COVID + flu) or vaccines administered within a certain timeframe of a COVID vaccine. IIS enhancements and development of standards to support linking data across systems should be prioritized to ensure readiness of our systems to track safety.
