MDs at One Medical typically specialize in family medicine, internal medicine, geriatrics or pediatrics. I aim to promote how to live a healthy and balanced lifestyle. My approach is to use a whole-body perspective to understand and ultimately optimize well-being of body and mind. I strive to provide clinical advice and guidance that is evidence-based and integrative across various disciplines to help patients reach their health goals, with an emphasis on natural healing and a thorough understanding of the benefits and risks of treatments and therapies. I am particularly passionate about fitness, nutrition, sports/physical medicine, and integrative medicine. Originally from LA, I have had the pleasure of working at some of the finest medical institutions across our country, namely UCLA, Westchester Medical Center, NYU, UCSF, Kaiser Permanente, and now One Medical. I currently call the Long Beach/OC area home with my beautiful wife and daughter. How I stay healthy and happy I believe a healthy lifestyle begins with prioritizing one's self with an appropriate balance of work and play. In particular, I have personal interests in yoga and meditation, eating and occasionally cooking delicious foods, traveling to explore new cultures and experiences, and creating lasting memories with family and friends.
