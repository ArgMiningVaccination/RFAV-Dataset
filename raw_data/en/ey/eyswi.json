(Details are annexed at Annexure-IV) Table - 77: Prevalent Diseases under SCSP S. No. Name of The Child Health Care Programme (RCH) under Schedule Caste Sub Plan (SCSP) Background: The women and children are important constituents of any society. In India, from the ancient time, they are considered as a very important segment of society. They also constitute a large population group. From Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) view, this group is vulnerable and at more risk. Despite commendable work done in the field by the Government and NGOs, the health of the mother and child still form one of the most serious problems affecting the community. This situation is graver in the women and children of SC/ST community. UN report says that the average Dalit woman in India dies 14.6 years younger than women from higher castes. A woman's caste in Annual Report 2019-20 Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences 179India increases her exposure to mortality because of poor sanitation and inadequate healthcare. The condition of Sc women in India needs more attention. Ayurveda the ancient tradition of Indian Systems of Medicine has sustained the population for centu- ries, with effective cures and remedies for numerous conditions, including those relating to women and children, with minimal side effects. As an apex body of research in Ayurveda, under the pro- gramme Schedule Caste sub-plan CCRAS has provided health care services and carried out aware - ness activities for maintenance and promotion of health of SC communities by Ayuvedic approaches through its different Institutes across the country. Considering the strength of Ayurveda in the man- agement of health related problems of women and children, the Council has also decided extend its activities specially for women and children though RCH under SCSP programme at 19 Institutes in 18 States across the country. The programme was carried out from January 2019 to February 2020 with following aim and objectives- AiMS To provide mother and child health care awareness and medical services in the Schedule Caste (SC) dominant community. To provide health care services and to create awareness about health hygiene and diet among woman and children of Schedule Caste (SC) dominant Community. ObJECTivES 1. To study the Socio-Economic status, living conditions, Educational status, dietetic habits, life styles and health care seeking behaviour of SC Women and Children 2. To generate awareness on Ayurvedic concepts i.e. Swasthavrita, Pathyapathya, Sadvitta, etc. for promotion and maintenance of health and improvement OF the quality of life 3. To provide primary health care services at their door steps through Ayurveda especially to women and children of SC community to reduce the mortality & morbidity. 4. To Collect the data regarding Traditional Practices during Pre-conception, Antenatal, Postnatal period and Children. Methodology: Each Institute had selected 5-10 villages considering the predominance of SC population with the target of 5000 women and children. The approval of Institutional Ethics Committee was obtained at each participating Institute before initiation of the work. The data was collected in the specially designed data collection forms both in hard and soft copy (e-format). Following activities were carried out in the programme: 1. Demographic house hold survey of SC women and children 2. Health care services to pregnant women 3. Management of various gynecological problems of women of reproductive age 4. Health care services to children up to 12 years of age.Annual Report 2019-20 Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences 1805. Awareness activities for prevention of diseases and promotion of health through Ayurveda, home remedies for common ailments, importance of diet and nutrition, significance of ante natal, peri natal and post natal care. Work carried out during the reporting year Under this programme, total 101 villages were selected based on SC dominated population through 19 Institutes. Total 137558 target population (women & children) surveyed for their health and socio-economic status through 4382 Tours in 18 States.

No.Name of the InstitutePrevalent Diseases 1. in Ayurvedic Sciences 1826.4 Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda) with National Programme for Prevention and control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) kills almost 41 million people each year, equivalent to 71% of deaths globally. Every year, 15 million people die from a NCD between the ages of 30 and 69 years; over 85% of these \"premature\" deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Cardiovascular diseases account for most NCD deaths, followed by Cancers (9 million), respiratory diseases (3.9million), and Diabetes (1.6 million).These 4 groups of diseases account for over 80% of all premature NCD deaths. It is projected that globally NCDs will account for nearly 44 million deaths in 2020 (Global status report on non-communicable diseases 2010). Keeping in view of the mortality rate due to NCDs, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India had launched the National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) in 2008, to prevent the projected increase in the burden of Non-Communicable Diseases on pilot basis and thereafter it was launched in 21 states during the year 2010-12 with the aim of health promotion; prevention and control of NCDs through early screening. The leading cause of NCDs is faulty diet and sedentary lifestyle. Ayurveda, the age old indigenous system of health care, primarily focuses on prevention of diseases through life style modifications. Therefore it was felt that AYUSH (Ayurveda) interventions (based on the fundamental concepts) can play a pivotal role in prevention, control and treatment of NCDs. With this view, several meetings were held under the chairmanship of Secretary, AYUSH, Ministry of AYUSH and officials of Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health & Family Welfare and arrived at a conclusion to initiate the programme \"Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda) with NPCDCS programme\" through CCRAS Bhilwara (Rajasthan), Surendranagar (Gujarat), Gaya (Bihar) to prevent and control the projected increase in the burden of NCDs through early screening. Therefore, in view of the above, Integration of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani & Homoeopathy) for promotion of health and prevention of diseases has been made one of the mandates of NPCDCS programme. The main objectives of this programme are as under: Integration of Ayurveda to the existing healthcare system for promotion, prevention and control of non-communicable diseases through NPCDCS program. Early diagnosis of NCDs for management through food & life style changes through principles of Ayurveda.
