The purpose of an aromatherapy massage is not so much to physically work out all the kinks and sore spots in your body, but to use the restorative properties of essential oils to relax and heal your body and mind. Essential oils are 100 percent natural, highly concentrated plant essences. There are more than 3,000 essential oils out there, each with its own therapeutic qualities. Oils can have purifying, calming, aphrodisiac, antibacterial, soothing and even euphoric effects. You might assume that the oils work their magic through contact with your skin during the massage, and that's definitely part of it -- but most of the benefits occur when you inhale their aromas and absorb them through the soft tissues in your nose and mouth. In aromatherapy massages, the focus is on the healing benefits of the oils. The desired effect is pure relaxation.
