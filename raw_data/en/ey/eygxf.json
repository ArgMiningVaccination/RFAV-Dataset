Check out these easy exercises you can do anywhere! Finding the time to work out during the holiday season can be challenging, especially if you are traveling. Check out these easy ways you can stay fit when you're already on the move - all you need is a pair of tennis shoes! Walking is an easy way to get in a quick workout. While it might not be the full body workout you were looking for, walking can still help you maintain a healthy body weight. Walking can also help lower your risk of heart disease, stroke, and high blood pressure. Even a short stroll around the block is good for you! Just like walking, hiking is a great way to stay active and get out in the fresh air. Look up hiking trails near your destination ahead of time. Strengthen your core and lower body while taking in some scenic views. No trails nearby? Even hiking across flat land can still rack up the burned calories! Some gyms offer \"drop-in\" classes if you are a member. If your gym has other locations, look into attending a class wherever you are traveling! Most of the time you can even schedule your new class attendance the same day for even more convenience. Running at least 10 minutes a day can help lower your chance of cardiovascular disease. Running can also boost your energy levels and metabolism. Be sure to look at a map and plan out your route if you are in an unfamiliar place, though! Yoga is a great way to work out in limited space, and does not require a ton of equipment. In addition to strengthening your muscles and promoting flexibility, yoga can help reduce inflammation in the body. Traveling can be stressful, but yoga can also help you better connect to yourself and improve mindfulness and mental health! Online resources such as apps or streaming services are great for workouts. There are plenty of \"15 Minute Ab Workouts\" or \"15 Minute Burn Fitness\" videos available online that are free to access. Even a short video can help you stay active while traveling! When you're in a pinch, don't forget about exercising the old-fashioned way! Pushups, sit ups, crunches, and lunges are all still great ways to work your muscles. Combined with some cardio, it's the perfect on-the-go workout you can do anywhere! We are here when you need us! Patient First is able to evaluate and treat a wide range of illnesses and injuries.
