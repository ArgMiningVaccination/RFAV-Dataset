Whether you're facing complex and chronic health concerns or simply looking to support your overall well-being, we look forward to providing quality care that makes a difference in your life. [Schedule Today](/contact/#schedule-today) Our psychiatry PAs prescribe and manage mental health medications for adults. While medications can play an important role for many, medications are often only a part of a treatment plan that may also include recommendations for therapy and lifestyle changes to help with your overall wellness. We take an evidence-based approach to prescribing medications, and believe in conservative prescribing practices by focusing on the least number and lowest effective doses of medications, while typically avoiding the use of controlled Group Although all yoga is potentially therapeutic and healing, yoga therapy is the specific application of yogic tools to support an individual's physical, mental, and emotional needs. By understanding how particular practices affect the body and mind, a program of practices can be developed to address a client's specific goals while considering any limitations they might be experiencing. Yoga therapy tools can include breathwork, meditation, guided relaxation, physical postures, philosophy, and more. Yoga therapy can benefit experienced yogis as well as people who have no yoga experience at all, including those with mobility limitations. Indeed, one of the most beautiful aspects of yoga is that it can be adapted to meet any person where that person is. Provider: [Susan Bernhardt, CAP, C-IAYT, RMT, LMT](/our-team/bio-susan-bernhardt/) Acupuncture is one modality of Traditional Chinese Medicine offered at our clinic. Through careful observation, acupuncturists study each individual's health concerns, tailoring each treatment based on the unique needs of each person. This helps enhance the body's innate ability to heal and recover. Provider: [Kim Reece, Dipl. OM., L.Ac.](/our-team/bio-kim-reece/) For thousands of years and in many cultures around the world, Chinese medicine has been used as a primary health care system. Treatment can consist of the use of needles (acupuncture), medicinal herbs, massage, and other therapies. Nutritional and lifestyle changes are also a critical aspect of TCM treatments. Provider: [Kim Reece, Dipl. OM., L.Ac.](/our-team/bio-kim-reece/) How you think about what you are eating is often as important as what you are eating. Our Integrative and Functional nutrition specialist helps you achieve vitality through a holistic, personalized approach to health and healing, exploring root causes of your issues in a safe and non-judgmental space. Once health goals are developed, a variety of individualized nutrition therapies are integrated, (whole foods/traditional foods, therapeutic diets, prescriptive eating, tailored supplements, mind-body work) and focus is placed on letting your body be the guide through the healing process. Testing may be utilized to help us know what interventions will be most helpful for you. Provider: [Erin Barnes, Registered Dietitian](/our-team/bio-erin-barnes/) Thai Massage is an ancient form of bodywork with deep roots in Ayurveda and yoga. It addresses the whole person through therapeutic massage techniques for muscles and connective tissues, stretching, energy work, acupressure, reflexology, and other methods, resulting in deep relaxation and healing. Sessions can target specific areas of pain or discomfort, or they can focus on overall relaxation. Like western forms of massage, Thai massage aids relaxation, decreases stress, increases circulation, and releases tight muscles. Also as in western massage, the depth of work can vary as desired, with techniques for deep tissue massage and myofascial release, as well as for gentler pressure. Thai massage differs from western massage in several significant ways: Unlike many other forms of massage, the recipient wears comfortable clothing, making oils and lotions unnecessary. Being fully clothed helps increase a sense of safety for those who have experienced various forms of trauma, and our practitioner also utilizes consent-focused language to make sure the client feels comfortable with the experience - every step of the way. The client typically lies on a futon-like mat on the floor instead of a massage table. Thai massage is designed to work with the flows of energy in the body. Finally, a hallmark of Thai massage is passive stretching. The massage therapist may place the receiver in various positions that recall yoga poses. The receiver need not be flexible or have any yoga experience. Indeed, those who lack flexibility can benefit greatly from Thai massage precisely because of its unique use of stretching combined with other techniques. Provider: [Susan Bernhardt, CAP, C-IAYT, RMT, LMT](/our-team/bio-susan-bernhardt/) When you are experiencing challenges with mental, physical, or emotional health, your ability to function in your daily life is often compromised. Occupational Therapy is a profession that is \"function forward\" and utilizes a variety of modalities and approaches to assist you in your healing journey. We take a holistic approach in helping you identify barriers to meaningful participation in your day-to-day. Then we work to develop strategies to build knowledge, skills, and confidence that will allow for increased access to the activities you want and need to do to align your daily actions with your values and goals. We will work together to establish sustainable habits, rituals, and routines to increase a sense of autonomy over your wellness. Providers: [Tracy Garber, OTR/L](/our-team/bio-tracy-garber/) [Tamara Nascene, OTR/L](/our-team/bio-tamara-nascene/) Ayurveda is the traditional, holistic healing science of India and one of the oldest continuously practiced forms of medicine in the world. Ayurveda includes formal branches of medicine as well as home practices around lifestyle and diet. Ayurveda applies across the spectrum of health of body and mind, whether the goal is to preserve good health or to address specific health concerns. Through individualized plans, Ayurveda aims to address root causes, alleviate symptoms, and restore and maintain balance of the body, mind, and consciousness. Ayurveda's tools include daily routines, diet and food as medicine, herbal remedies, cleansing practices, and more, and can incorporate yoga practices such as breathwork and meditation. Our practitioner, Susan Bernhardt, holds an Advanced Ayurveda Practitioner certification from Ayurved Sadhana Vidyalaya. She is Board-Certified as an Ayurvedic Practitioner by the National Ayurvedic Medicine Association (\"NAMA\"), with a scope of practice that includes pathology and disease management as well as preventive healthcare and health promotion using diet and lifestyle, and she holds NAMA's highest level of professional membership and its Ayurvedic Yoga Therapist designation. Provider: [Susan Bernhardt, CAP, C-IAYT, RMT, LMT](/our-team/bio-susan-bernhardt/) Tibetan Cranial\u00ae is an ancient healing tradition from the Himalayan highlands. During a session, the recipient lies fully clothed on their back while the practitioner works on the head and neck, using sophisticated pulse readings to deliver the most appropriate treatment and to help the body achieve optimal balance. The practitioner listens to what the recipient's body is saying through the pulses and provides support for the recipient's body to shift toward balance, health, and equanimity. The fundamental beauty of this work is its ability to support the body in its ongoing efforts to heal itself. People often ask if TC is similar to Cranial Sacral Therapy, massage, or energy work. It is truly different from other healing modalities. The system of pulse reading is unique, as is the method of applying touch to the bones of the skull in response to the pulses. TC can be beneficial for anyone, and many people with various symptoms involving the neck, head, jaw, ears, face, or nervous system particularly enjoy TC. Provider: [Susan Bernhardt, CAP, C-IAYT, RMT, LMT](/our-team/bio-susan-bernhardt/) Reiki Energy Healing is a gentle practice that supports relaxation and helps bring balance to the body, mind, emotions, and spirit. During a session, the practitioner places their hands on or near the fully-clothed recipient. After a session, many recipients report a great sense of calmness and balance. This relaxation response has powerful effects of its own. Studies have shown that Reiki can benefit people who are tense, stressed, anxious, or fatigued. Studies also have shown that Reiki can help people manage chronic or acute pain. Reiki supports the well-being of persons undergoing other medical procedures, including treatment for cancer. Our provider, Susan Bernhardt, is a Licensed Massage Therapist, Tibetan Cranial Practitioner and Teacher, and Reiki Master Teacher.

Because of things like trauma, stress, injury, and illness, our brains rewire and change and get stuck in maladaptive patterns that contribute to the symptoms that hinder our ability to function more productively and live more joyfully. Through the use of electrodes strategically placed on the head and neck, MCNF monitors the brain waves and produces a measurable change in the brainwaves without conscious effort from the individual receiving the feedback. This temporary change allows the brain to reorganize itself, disrupting the negative thought patterns that stop us from being the best version of ourselves. IASIS does not train the brain, instead it \"disentrains\" the brain by allowing it to reorganize itself and abandon the faulty patterns that contribute to debilitating symptoms. This is analogous to \"rebooting\" a frozen computer. IASIS MCNF is a powerful, pain free, non-invasive, and drug-free solution that taps into our brains ability to create new neural pathways\u2014a scientifically proven ability called Neuroplasticity. It is safe and effective for all ages and has been found to be beneficial for optimal performance and a number of conditions such as complex trauma/ PTSD, ADHD/ADD, addiction/ recovery, stress disorders, anxiety/ panic, OCD, depression, brain fog, concussions/ head injuries, chronic pain, developmental delays, ASD, memory problems, headaches/ migraines, sleep problems, stroke, tinnitus, and more. IASIS Micro Current Neurofeedback is the first technology of its kind that has image-based evidence of its efficacy and produces fast results in a limited number of sessions. The result is a changed brainwave state and a much greater ability for the brain and nervous system to regulate itself.
