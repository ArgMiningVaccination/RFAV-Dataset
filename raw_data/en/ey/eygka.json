These general methods tend to involve various well-known and highly-regarded remedies such as acupuncture, ayurvedic medicine, body/mind medicine spirituality, Chinese medicine, naturopathy, yoga, etc. A look at interuniversalism However, it's been only in recent years, that these \"new age\" medicines have been discovered and used. One such medicine or \"philosophy\" is Interuniversalism - a practice that [Mohammad Ali Taheri](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/11793342/Iran-accused-of-sentencing-dead-man-to-death-to-cover-up-torture.html) founded before his death in January 2015 due to a hunger strike. Interuniversalism has two complementary medicines to it \u2014 Psymetnology and Faradarmani \u2014 and they are the kind of healing that looks at the human being in a holistic manner. It's a spiritual-based medicine that extends beyond the mortal coil and into its existence. Based on the idea, humans have hundreds of bodies, not just a physical form. These bodies include the mental body, psychological body, astral body, etc. Faradarmani medicine According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are five categories of C.A.M. - [Faradarmani](http://www.interuniversalism.org/faradarmani) is listed under the fourth category - Mind/Body Intervention and its sub-category Mental Healing.

The research was conducted to learn what the extent of the [Faradarmani effect has on anxiety](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042811023202?via%3Dihub). The Beck Anxiety Inventory had a pre- and post-experiment method and control used on two groups of people. The groups were chosen at random, and the experiments took place at the same time so that their scores could be statistically compared. After six weeks of therapy, it was discovered that the experimental group's Beck scores dropped significantly. Interuniversalism uses 21st century technology to teach holistic medicine Since Faradarmani can help with various aspects of the human body, it's no big surprise that its practices are spreading far and wide. There are hundreds of instructors teaching the interuniversalism idea and the various practices. Workshops have also been set up, usually in community service centers and home basements.
