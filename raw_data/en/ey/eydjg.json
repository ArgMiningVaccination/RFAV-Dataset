Fu) ABSTRACT Rabies is a fatal encephalitis caused by rabies virus. It causes more than 5 9,000 human death s worldwide annually . Rabies vaccination can prevent the development of rabies in humans and animals. In dogs, booster vaccination is administered annually or triennially , as per local law or the vaccine s used. To evaluate the long -term efficacy of current rabies vaccines, beagles vaccinated 6 and 8 years ago, were challenged with a virulent rabies virus . Blood and lymph node aspirates were collected for the analysis of immune responses. It was found that 80% of the six-year vaccinated dogs survived with the induction of high level s of virus -neutralizing antibodies (VNA) , whereas 80% of the eight -year vaccinated dogs and all of the non-vaccinated dogs succumbed to rabies. Also, six-year vaccinated dogs induced better cellular immune responses than other dogs. These results indicate that a single shot of rabies vacci ne can protect dogs for up to six years.

There are many recording s about rabies in myth. Acteon, a famous hunter in one tale, was torn up to death by his own hounds, which are thought to be rabid dogs (George M. Baer, 1991) . He used the term \"raging dog \" or hydrophobia to describe rabies . The first description of the disease is recorded around 500 years B.C. by Democritus (George M. Baer, 1991) . In the 1st century, Cornelius Celsus, a Greek physician focused on rabies, published that rabies can be transmitted by dog bites (George M. Baer, 1991) . He was the first one to use the term rabies (Rupprecht, Hanlon, & Hemachudha, 2002) . During the same period , in Roman, Sribonius Largus insisted that there was no chance for a rabid patient to recover (Alan C. Jackson, 2013) . At the same time, Eumedes, a physician, observed the obvious sign of hydrophobia, with even several drops of tears en ough to excite the convulsion of the pharynx (Fleming, 1872) . Then, in about the 2nd century, Magnus of Ephesus started to study the disease in the stomach and diaphragm (Fleming, 1872) . About three hundred years later, during the fifth century, Caelius Aurelianus, an ancient authority , concluded from the history and studied the disease careful ly and summarized the symptoms of rabies diseases. Preceded by extreme irritability, awkward sitting, wakefulness, nausea, hydrophobia, and fear of sound s, rabies - 2 infected human s will succumb to death in the end (Fleming, 1872) . Even though many physicians and researchers had devoted tremendous efforts to the study of rabies, including pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment, there were still many incorrect perspectives of this disease until the early 20th century. With the development of human medical sciences, rabies has become better described in human s. In 1584, Firolamo Fracastoro, an Italian scholar, first recorded the nature of rabies, and the inevit able death following the occurrence of clinical symptoms (Fu, 1997) . Until now, there have only been several exceptions (Alvarez, Fajardo, Lopez, Pedroza, Hemachudha, Kamolvarin, Cortes, & Ba er, Prevention, 2012; In the hundreds of years since , many scientists and researchers have been devoted t o rabies prevention, Zinke, Francois Magendie and Gilbert Breschet showed that rabies can be transmitted by saliva from dog s to rabbits and from dogs to human s (Fu, 1997) . With more and more components of rabies elucidated , finally in 1885, based on predecessors' work, Louis Pasteur made the first rabies vaccine (Garg, 2014) . Even though the first rabies vaccine was developed more than one hundred years ago and much progress has been made in this area , rabies remains endemic in most part s of the world . With more than 99% of rabies deaths in human s occur ring in the developing countries , rabies has outspread to almost all parts of the world (WHO, 2005a) . Nowadays, Western Europe, Canada, the United States of America (USA), Japan, Malaysia, and some 3 Latin American countries have been regarded as canine rabies -free area s (World Health, 2013) . However, rabies sti ll exist s in wild animals , such as skunks, raccoons, foxes, raccoon dogs , and bats in these countries . Wh ile traveling in those areas, there are chances for humans to get bitten by wild animal virus carriers (World Health, 2013) . Rabies epidemiology Every year, there are about 5 9,000 people reported as dying from rabies and more than 7 million have been expose d to rabies (Rupprecht, Willoughby, & Slate, 2006) . However, the actual number may be even higher due to underreporting. Most human rabies cases happen in the developing countries of Africa and Asia , where domestic d ogs are the major reser voir (Pounder, 2005) . Worldwide, about 95 % of human rabies is transmitted by dogs (Meslin, 2005) , while in the developed countries, bats, foxes, coyotes, raccoons, and skunks are the major reservoirs for rabies (Rupprecht, Willoughby, & Slate, 2006) . In Asia, rabies is a severe public health problem. Approximately 39,000 people die from rabies each year, together wit h substantial animal welfare, economic , and human health problems (Tenzin & Ward, 2012) . The human deaths in Asia account for about 56% of the total human rabies deaths world wide . India is a typical country with serious rabies problem s. It ha s been reported that rabies exists in almost all regions of the country In comparison to other countries, India has the highest rate of human rabies , with an estimated annual 20,000 human deaths from the disease (2.86/10 0,000 population) 2007) . The majority of human rabies in India are ca used by dog bites , with the remaining 3% from cats and wildlife Gangaboraiah, 2006) . However, it is unfortunate that the Indian government has not regarded rabies as an important infectious disease, despite the high rabies mortality (Sudarshan, Madhusudana, Mahendra, Gangaboraiah, 2007) . In Pakistan, rabies is also endemic. It causes around 4 ,000 human deaths every year (Jamali, 2001) . Pet animals in Pakista n are mostly vaccinated under the care of veterinarians. H owever , there are lots of stray dogs that remain unvaccinated. In China, rabies cases are also reported in almost all provinces (Hu, Tang, Tang, & Fooks, 2009) . Most human rabie s cases are reported in rural areas (Hu, Tang, Tang, & Fooks, 2009; Song, Tang, Wang, Mo, Guo, Li, Tao, Rupprecht, Feng, & Liang, 2009) . Rural street dogs are responsible for more than 95% of the human rabies cases. The two ma jor reasons that rabies is endemic in developing countries are the substantial economic burden associated with rabies control and the lacking understanding of the true public health impact of rabies (Cleaveland, Kaare, Knobel, & Laurenson, 2006) . In addition , other reasons, include poor control of the stray dogs in rural areas, and the high price of vaccines for animals. Well -organized rabies control programs, particularly rabies vaccin ation , are extremely needed in these developing countries. In the developed countries , such as the US, wild animals account for more than 90% of reported rabid animal cases. In Western and Southern Europe, canine rabies gradually disappeared from most countries during the first half of the 20th century, and 5 foxes contributed to 83% rabid animals before the use of wildlife vaccination (Finnegan, Brookes, Johnson, Smith, Mansfield, Keene, McElhinney, & Fooks, 2002) . In 2011, wild animals resulted in 91.8% of the 6,031 rabid animals reported in the USA, while domestic animals only contributed 8.2% of rabies cases. Rabies has been well controlled for more than 55 years. For the last three decades , most human rabies cases have been associated with rabies viruses carried by wildlife , part icularly bats (Anderson, Nicholson, Tauxe, & Winkler, 1984; Messenger, Smith, & Rupprecht, 2002) . However, there are also some other important animal reservoirs contributing to rabies maintenance, such as raccoons, foxes, skunks, and mongooses. During the past three decades after intensive implementation of oral rabies vaccination programs, fox -mediated rabies from vast areas of Western and Central Europe have been eliminated (Freuling, Hampson, Selhorst, Schroder, Meslin, Mettenleiter, & Muller, 2013) . Rabies virus (RABV) is an enveloped, bullet -shaped , negative -stranded RNA virus, belonging to the genus Lyssavirus , family Rhabdoviridae . The genome of rabies virus is about 12kb in length, encoding for five proteins : nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), glycoprotein (G), and polymer ase (L ). The family Rhabdoviridae consists of 6 genera and more than 100 viruses with a wide range of hosts, in both plants and animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish (Kumin, Novella, Dietzgen, morphology is the common shape of the v iruses in this family (Kumi diseases in plants, 6 Novirhabdovirus can cause diseases in fish and other aquatic animals, and Vesiculovirus and Ephemerovirus can result in diseases in livestock s (Kumin, Novella, Dietzgen, Padhi, & Rupprecht, 2009) . Infection with these viruses can have a great impact on the economi es (Kuzmin, Hughes, & Rupprecht, 2006) . Howev er, Lyssavirus , the most important genus in the family of Rhabdoviridae , includes the deadly rabies virus, which causes human death s and huge economic loss es. There are fourteen Lyssaviruses , divid ed into two large phylogroups according to genetic diversity, pathogenicity , and immunogenicity (Alan C. Jackson, 2013) . The two phylogroups are divided into seven genotypes. Phylogroup I includes the classic (prototype) rabies 1 ), 1 and 2 (EBL1, EBL2 , Perrin, & The viruses in the family of Rhabdoviridae , which means rod in Greek, all have similar shape s. They are all rod- or bullet -shaped with length s varying from 130 to 380nm and width s varying from 60 to 95nm (Brown, Bishop, Crick, Francki, Holland, Hull, Johnson, Martelli, Murphy, Obijeski, Peters, Pringle, Reichmann, Schneider, Shope, Simpson, Summe rs, & Wagner, 1979) . The rabies virus particle is about 180 by 75 nm, having a knoblike structure at one end and a smooth , flat opposite end (Hummeler, Koprowski, & Wiktor, 1967) . There are two membranes, with many protrusions on the surface, of different densities surrounding the virus and one inner filamentous material core (Hummeler, Koprowski, & Wiktor, 1967) . Inside t he inner core, ribonucleoprotein (RNP), 7 is comprised of three protein s, N, P, and L. The outer membrane consist s of membrane proteins, G and M (Alan C. Jackson, 2013) . N protein The rabies virus N protein consists of 450 amino acids (Alan C. Jackson, 2013) . It is the most conserved protein in all of the lyssaviruses . However , it also has a relatively high degree of genetic diversity between genotypes (Marston, McElhinney, Johnson, Muller, Conzelmann, Tordo, & Fooks, 2007) . N protein is a phosphorylated protein an d plays an important role in virus transcription and replication. It is phosphorylated by cellular casein kinase II (X. Wu, Lei, & Fu, 2003) . It regulate s transcription and replication of the virus by modulation of leader RNA encapsulation (J. Yang, Koprowski, Dietzschold, & Fu, 1999) . If the nucleoprotein is not phosphorylated, the level of both viral transcription and replication will be reduced , and viral production will decrease by as much as 10,000 -fold (X. F. Wu, Go ng, Foley, Schnell, & Fu, 2002) . N is an important antigenic protein in lyssavirus , and it is very crucial for the immune response s. There are several linear epitopes and conformational epitopes on the N protein . The linear epitopes are suitable for rabies virus diagnosis, while the conformational epitopes can be used for probing the structure of N protein (Jiang, Luo, Michel, Hogan, He, & Fu, 2010) . Capable of inducing helper T cells, the N protein is a major antigen of rabies virus. There are three antigenic sites o n nucleoprotein (Lafon & Wiktor, 1985) . There are also some epitopes of the rabies virus nucleoprotein that induc e B cells and T cells (da Cruz, McBride, Conceicao, Dale, McFadden, & Dellagostin, 2001) . Since the rabies virus N is highly antigenic to activate B cells to produce antibodies and T helper 8 cells, it was used as a vaccine component against rabies virus and also as a vector for other disease s (Koser, McGettigan, Tan, Smith, Koprowski, Dietzschold, & Schnell, 2004) . When expressed in insect cells, purified N protein is still antigenically and immunogenically comparable to the rabies virus ribonucleoprotein Schumache r, Wunner, Ertl, & Koprowski, 1991) . Rabies virus N helps to evade activation of the RIG-I-mediated antiviral response s of the host (Masatani, Ito, Shimizu, Ito, Nakagawa, Sawaki, Koyama, & Sugiyama, 2010) . In this function, amino acids at positions 273 and 394 play a very important role, which make s the evasion more efficient (Masatani, Ito, Shimizu, Ito, Nakagawa, Abe, Yamaoka, & Sugiyama, 2011) . P protein The rabies virus P protein consists of 297 or 303 amino acids, accounting for 6% of the total amount of proteins in the virions and it is the most non -conserved protein (Alan C. Jackson, 2013) .This monomer consists of two -helices , which the counterpart in vesicular stomatitis virus , the P protein in rabies virus can form dimer s. As an essential cofactor of the virus RNA -dependent RNA polymerase , the P protein plays an important role in virus transcription and replication (Chenik, Chebli, Gaudin, & Blondel, 1994; Li, Dong, Shi, Deng, Chen, Wan, Zhou, Zhao, Fu, & Peng, 2016) . P protein i nteract s with other protein s for more efficient transcription (Tan, Preuss, Williams, & Schnell, 2007) . The P protein also interacts with STAT1 and interferon, . The P protein interferes with the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 and inhibits its nuclear accumulation to prevent interferon re sponse s 9 2007) . In the infected cells, rabies virus P protein can interact with mitochondrial proteins, generating more reactive oxygen species (Kammouni, Wood, Saleh, Appolinario, Fernyhough, & Jackson, 2015) . G protein Rabies virus G protein consist s of 524 amino acids and accounts for 42 per cent of the whole virus protein s. The oligomerization state of G is a trimeric structure with a \"head\" and a Tuffereau, Knossow, 1992) . Low pH can result in conformational change of the G protein, which plays an important role in membrane fusion (Y. Gaudin, R. W. Ruigrok, M. Knossow, & A. Flamand, 1993) . Rabies virus G is involved in interacting with receptors , contributing to its neuroinvasiveness many antigenic sites on the G protein , which induce s the generation of virus neutralizing antibod ies (VNA) , providing protection to the host (Cox, Dietzschold, & Schneider, 1977) . There are tw o antigenic sites, site s IIa, and III, which are domina nt for the . M protein The matrix (M) protein forms the outside layer of the RNP coil , maintaining it in the condensed form (Mebatsion, Weiland, & Conzelmann, 1999a) . Acting as a replication - stimulatory factor , the M protein helps to keep the balance between viral replication and transcription (Finke, Mueller -Waldeck, & Conzelmann, 2003) . The M protein also plays an important role in virus assembly and budding by getting involved in the cellular 10 translation machinery and interacting with cellular prot eins (Komarova, Real, B orman, M protein , interacts with WW domains of cellular proteins and promote s virus budding (Harty, Paragas, Sudol, & Schnell, . The M protein is also associated with cytopathogenicity. The amino acid at position 95 determines the cytopathogenicity of the virus (Mita, Shimizu, Ito, Yamada, Ito, Sugiyama, & Minamoto, 2008) . L protein In rabies virus, the L and P protein s form the RNA polymerase complex, which plays a crucial role in viral replication and transcription. The dynein light chain 1 (DLC1) binding motif in the L can mediate microtubule (MT ) binding through dy nein motors, making the L protein accumulate at the acetylated and reorganized MT s (Bauer, Nolden, Nemitz, Perlson, & Finke, 2015) . It has been shown that the function of the L protein is related to the mRNA capping, methyltran sferase , and poly erg, Bougueleret, & Tordo, 1990) . Rabies virus life cycle Like most viruses, the life cycle of rabies virus can be divided into three phases. The first phase consists of virus binding and enter ing into permissive cells by endocytosis, releasing the viral genome into the cytosol after fusion of the viral and endosom al membrane s. The second phase is the process of producing virion component s, including transcription, replication , and protein synthesis. The third phase is viral component 11 assembly and ex ocytosis of the virions. The mature virion will find a new host cell and start a new infection and life cycle. The very first step of the rabies virus life cycle is virus attachment to cells. Rabies virus G protein binds to cells by interacting with cell surface receptors. There are several receptors that can bind to rabies virus G. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is one of the receptors that bind to rabies virus , and the -subunit peptide of the receptor is the binding site for the rabies virus (Lentz, 1990) . Other than the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor s, the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), CD56, on the cell surface has also been proposed as a rabies virus receptor (Thoulouze, Lafage, Schachner, Hartmann, Cremer, & Lafon, 1998) . rabies virus receptors is the in this neurotrop hin receptor is cysteine -rich domain stud ies showed that P75NTR is essential for rabies virus infection in primary neurons (Tuffereau, Schmidt, Langevin, Lafay, Dec hant, & Koltzenburg, 2007) . In addition, sialylated gangliosides, as components of receptor structure, facilitate the binding of rabies virus to infected cells (Superti, Hauttecoeur, Morelec, Goldoni, Bizzini, & Tsiang, 1986) . After binding to the host cell, the virus enter s the cells by the endocytic pathway (Le Blanc, Outside of the host cells, the rabies virus particle can be detected both in clathrin -coated pits and in uncoated vesicles (Superti, Derer, & Tsiang, 12 1984) . The G protein will then g o through three conformational changes to allow the viral genome to enter the host cell cytoplasm. Then, the rabies virus is transported from the endosome into the cytosol. The pH changes in the endosome will induce changes in the G protein structure and release of the viral capsid. When the pH lowers to 6.4, there will be viral aggregation at the binding site and the G become s sensitive to proteases. When the pH value decreas es to 6.1, the endosom al membrane starts to fuse with viral G (Y. Gaudin, R. W. H. Ruigrok, viruses , this conformational change is reversible according to the equilibrium of the pH (Gaudin, Tuffereau, Segretain, Knossow, & Flamand, 1991) . So both in the binding and membrane fusion processes, the G protein plays an important role. The second phase of the viral cycle is the transcription and replication of the viral genome. Once the RNP is released into the cytosol, th e viral RNA switches from the condensed and helical pattern to a relaxed form, which is synthetically active (Schnell, McGettigan, Wirblich, & Papaneri, 2010) . The -sense RNA, which is released in the cytoplasm , is used to produce the template for transcription, which is catalyzed by the RNA polymerase, the L -P polymerase complex (Albe rtini, Ruigrok, & Blondel, 2011) . However, the mechanism of the polymerase complex gaining access to the vRNA is not well-understood. The transcription process starts at the 3' -end of the genomic RNA. The polymerase complex can recognize a specific prom otor at the 3' -end and slide to the 5'-end by a mechanism called stop -start, in which transcription is terminated when the polymerase complex encounters a conserved signal sequence Then , six consecutive transcripts are 13 produc ed, a short uncapped and unpolyadenylated , leader five, successive , 5' end-capped and polyadenylated mRNAs coding for the N, P, M, G , proteins During transcription, the polymerase complex identifies differ ence signals, such as initiation, termination , and polyadenylation, which the cistrons (Albertini, Ruigrok, & Blondel, 2011) . Whe n the complex recognizes the stop signal, it then dissociates from the template and is ready to restart poorly at the next start signal (Albertini, Ruigrok, & Blondel, 2011) . The complex continues to transcribe the genome until it reaches the end of the L gene . There is a concentration gradient of the quantity of each mRNA according to their order in the genome, N > P > M > G > L (Albertini, Ruigrok, & Blondel, 2011) . When enough N proteins are produced , the replication is then activated (Liu, Yang, Wu, & Fu, 2004) . The r eplication process requires two parts that interact with each other. First, the ongoing protein synthesis is needed to produce enough soluble N protein, encapsulati ng the nascent RNA; second, the polymerase complex switches to replication, producing a complementary , full-length 2011) . In order to make the N protein bind cellular RNA and not aggregate , the positive -stranded RNAs are encapsulated by N protein and bond to the L -P complex (Peluso & Moyer, 1988) . The decorated positive -stranded RNAs are then used as a template to produce the negative -stranded genomic RNA . After transcription and replication, the viral life cycle enter s into t he third phase , virus assembly and release . In this phase, the M protein plays an important role in all negative -stranded RNA virus es, even though the structure s of the M protein s in different 14 viruses have only minor similarit ies (Schmitt & Lamb, 2004) . The M protein is beneath the lipid envelope, which ha s the benefit of connect ing the inner component RNP cores and the outer layer envelope G protien . This process starts when the vRNA is encapsidated and RNP is formed , which needs accumulation of viral protein s N, P, and L (Alan C. Jackson, 2013) . The M protein maintains the balance between viral transcription and replication by associating with transcriptionally active RNP (Finke & Conzelmann, 2003) . After the formation of the RNP, the M protein makes contact with the RNP complex and help s with viral assembly and ex ocytosis. After glycosylat ion, the trimeric G protein is aggregated at the cellular membrane , where the RNP . M plac e by localizing the RNP coil and interact s with the G protein (Mebatsion, Weiland, & Conzelmann, 1999b) . Then, the RNP is condensed by the M protein into a 'skeleton -like' form, tightly coiled, suspend the polymerase ac tivity (Alan C. Jackson, 2013) . The M protein, probably in the state of a dimer , gets enveloped by the cellular membrane, which is the start of the budding process. The budding process can also be regarded as the final stage of the assembly process. The lipid bilayer envelope is acquired when the assembled components, RNP , and M, bud through the cellular membrane. But this is not the only way for the virion to obtain the lipid bilayer membrane. Some virions mature intracellularly and obtain their outer layer membrane from the Golgi apparatus or cytoplasmic ER (Finke, Granzow, Hurst, Pollin, & Mettenleiter, 2010) . When the virion buds from the host cells, it needs to have the G protein anchored in the membrane and in the form of trimeric spike -like structures, which are helpful for efficient budding (Whitt, 15 Buonocore, Prehaud, & Rose, 1991) . The stability of the G protein trimer is enforce d by G-M interaction. Rabies pathogenesis and pathology Rabies virus is a deadly virus that causes severe neurotropic disease s. The virus travels from the peripheral nerves to the central nervous system (CNS), causing an acute infection. From the entry site of the virus to the CNS , there are several steps, including viral replication in peripheral tissues, traveling through peripheral nerves and the spinal cord to the bra in, viral spread within the CNS and back to peripheral organs, especially the salivary glands (Alan C. Jackson, 2013) . Change s in cell morphology and damage can be observed in different sites, as the rabies virus spreads through the nervou s system. For most cases of rabies virus infection, the viruses are introduced into the body by the bites of rabid dogs, even though there are very few cases showing that the virus can be spread via the airborne route (Winkler, 1968) . Clinical signs The incubation period of rabies ranges from weeks to months, and even to several years in rare occasions (George M. Baer, 1991; Charlton, Casey, & Campbell, 1987; Hanna, Carney, Smith, Tannenberg, Deverill, Botha, Serafin, Harrower, Fitzpatrick, & Searle, 2000) . Many factors contribute to the long and variable incubation period of rabies, including the virus strain, the site of exposure , and the dose . Depending on the strain and dose used, experimentally -infected dogs have incubation periods from 7 to 125 days (Fekadu, 1988) . Interestingly, the length of the incubation period has negative correlation with the virus dose (Fekadu, 1988) . Since the incubation period is mainly dose dependent, 16 it means that the incubation periods can be manually decreased by injecti ng a large amount of the virus. The classical development of canine rabies can be divided into three p hases: prodromal, excitative, and paralytic. There are two types of clinical rabies , furious rabies and dumb rabies. In the first form, the excitative phase is predominant while in the second , the disease progress es from the prodromal to the paralytic phase , because the excitative phase is too short or absent (Fekadu, 1993) . The prodromal phase usually lasts for 1 to 3 days. There may be some behavioral changes. Active and high -strung dogs may become more easy going than usual , while ordinarily friendly dogs may become shy and hide from humans or become irritable and snappy. Some other signs include slightly increased temperature, dilation of the pupils and drowsy eye contact. Importantly, profound salivation may occur. The excitative phase may last for 1 to 7 days, and the signs of this phase are most easily recogniz able. At the early point of this phase, the dog may shun people and hide in the dark. Then, the dog become restless and agitated. It may like to move and roam a lot. This is the most dangerous phase , because the dog becomes violent and will bite anything it encounters , whether human, animal , or inanimate object . In most cases, there is a typical change in the bark, an altered phonation, caused by paralysis of laryngeal muscles. In addition , spasms or even paralysis of the pharyngeal muscles make s it difficult to swallow and lead s to drooling. Sometimes, frothing of the drooling salivation occurs due to heavy and rapid respiration. After survival from the characteristic convulsive seizures, the dog enters into the paralytic phase. 17 The last phase is the paralytic stage. Sometimes , the excitative phase is extremely short or absent , and sick dogs progress d irectly to the paralytic phase (dumb rabies). In this phase, the disease usually causes muscular incoordination, paralysis, coma , and death. The most characteristic sign is the so-called \"dropped jaw \", result ing from paralysis of the masseter muscles , making it impossible to eat or drink . Usually, the dog will make choking sounds , as if bone s were stuck in the throat, leading people to attempt to remove the \"bone s\". This often results in owners scratching their hands on the dog 's teeth and expos e to the virus. The immune responses to infection During infection, the rabies virus faces host defenses in different ways. Firstly, when rabies virus is delivered to the skin or muscle, it is recognized rapidly by the early line of defense, the innate immune response. This results in not only local elimination of microbes but also the induction of specific immune response s, by B and T cells, in the periphery. After entry into the nerves, the rabies virus needs to counter the innate immune response s induc ed by the infect ion. As soon as the infection reaches the neurons, they are protected from elimination by infiltrating T cells and by limiting the inflammation of neuronal tissue . In addition , immunological homeostasis might also facilitate the propagation of the virus in the nervous system (Alan C. Jackson, 2013) . Preservation of the integrity of the neuronal network up to the brain stem gives the opportunity for the virus to reach the salivary glands and be transmitted (Alan C. Jackson, 2013) . The innate immune respo nse is the frontline of defense against infectious agents. In the spot where rabies virus is inoculated by bites or scratches , the innate immune 18 response is triggered in the first few hours after entry of the viruse s. This response is not pathogen specific . In the infected neurons, the antiviral, chemoattractive , and inflammatory response s play critical role s. Many components contribute to the innate immune response, including inflammatory cytokines , IFN/, TNF -,IL-1, and IL-6, - 10, MIP -1, and RANTES, which can be detected in experimental ly-infected animals and help to fight against the viruses (Akira, Yamamoto, & Takeda, 2003; A. C. Wang, Li, Dhingra, Tseggai, Jiang, & Fu, 200 5). The activation of the adaptive immune response occurs in the lymphoid organs. The CD4+ T cells recognize rabies virus that has been processed by the MHC II pathway by activated dendritic cells ( DC). With the help of CD4+ T cells, B cells are activated, which is an important part of the adaptive immune response (Garenne & Lafon, 1998) . After activation, CD4+ T cells can produce cytokines, such as IL -4, to trigger VNA production. However, it is not clear how VNA mediate virus clearance. There are two main hypotheses regarding how VNA act on rabies virus . One hypothesis is called \"steric hindrance \". In this theory, VNA can restrain virus attachment to host cells by blocking all G protein spikes on the surface of the virions (Irie & Kawai, 2002) . Another hypothesis states that the virion's ability to attach to host cells is restrained , but in a different way, through conformation al changes of the G protein spikes induced by VNA (Irie & Kawai, 2002) . In terms of CD8+ T cells, they show no measurable effect on protecting the host against RABV (Perry & Lodmell, 1991) . 19 Rabies vaccines Rabies virus causes lethal disease in human and animals, therefore prompt vaccination is very useful in prevent ing the disease prior to or post exposure . There are several vaccines that are commercially available for animals . Inactivated vaccines are most widely used in domestic animals, while live -attenuated vaccines or live recombinant vaccines have been developed and produced as oral vaccines for wild animals. Live recombinant canarypox vaccine expres sing RABV G protein In addition to the inactivated vaccine s, there is a live recombinant canarypox vaccine expressing rabies G protein for cats (Cadoz, Strady, Meignier, Taylor, Tartaglia, Paoletti, & Plotkin, 1992) . can not only be used as a mono valent vaccine for cats, but it can also be used as a multivalent vaccine that includes rabies, feline vector of the vaccine, canarypox virus vector or ALVA C, can only infect and cause diseases in avian species. Even though there is interrupted replication in non -avian cells, the canarypox virus vector is able to express foreign antigens during the early phase of vector replication and effectively sti mulates immune responses . Many animal species have been tested in clinical trials with this vaccine, showing a high level of safety and efficacy (Tartaglia, Jarrett, Neil, Desmettre, & Paoletti, 1993) . The use of adjuvant in inactivated vaccines to induce a strong immune response is related with feline fibrosarcom as. However , the live recombinant canarypox vaccine can stimulate protective immune responses with out the help of adjuvants, which is a huge advantage (Barber, Sorenmo, Cronin, & Shofer, 2000) . 20 Oral rabies vaccines for wild animals Since the 1970s , rabies in dogs has been wel l controlled in the US. However, rabies in wild animals continues to present a public health threat . More than 90% of rabies cases are reported in wild animals, which was a real threat to human s and domestic animals (Anderson, Nicholson, Tauxe, & Winkler, 1984; Messenger, Smith, & Rupprecht, 2002) . The first oral rabies vaccine l icensed in the USA is RABORAL\u00ae V -RG. This oral rabies vaccine was developed in 1984 when a recombinant vaccinia virus (V-RG) expressing rabies viru s G protein virus was constructed from the Copenhagen strain of vaccinia virus, and the thy midine kinase gene was deleted , and replaced by the cDNA of the rabies virus protein advanta ge of oral administration , the V-RG vaccines are mostly distributed by aircraft, helicopter , or even by drones, in different seasons in the wild (Selhorst, Muller, & Batza, 2006) . However, in some urban and suburban areas, manual distribution of vaccine baits is also preferably used as a complementary measure (Masson, Bruyere -Masson, Vuillaume, Lemoyne, & Aubert, 1999) . Distribut ion in the wild requires the V-RG vaccine to have great stability. The vaccine stays stable above 56 \u00b0C, while the bait -casing melt ing point can be as high as 1989) . The vaccine has also been tested in over 10 avian and 35 mammalian species, including the majority of rabies reservoir hosts , with the result s showing that it is safe for all of these animals. (Brochier, Blancou, V-RG 21 vaccine has been used to control rabies in the coyote population along the US-Mexico border, which was a great success in eliminating coyote rabies from the US A in the 1990s (Fearneyhough, Wilson, Clark, Smith, Johnston, Hicks, & Moore, 1998; Sidwa, Wilson, Moore, Oertli, Hicks, Rohde, & Johnston, 2005) . The second one is ONRAB\u00ae , licensed in Canada . This oral vaccine for wild animals is based on human adenovirus type 5 (HAd5) . The live recombinant virus was constructed by replacing the E3 region of the adenovirus genome with rabies G protein, in order to decrease the expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I antigens and free the virus -infected cells from T cells attack (Wold & Gooding, 1991; Y. P. Yang, Ertl, & Wilson, 1994) . Genetically and phenotypically, the vaccine has been prove n to be stable for up to 10 pa ssages both in vivo and in vitro . The vaccine has a large range of animal hosts , including mice, dogs, foxes, and skunks, either by parenteral or oral route. In all of these animals, the vaccine induces protective VNA against rabies virus infection (Charlton, Artois, Prevec, Campbell, Casey, Wandeler, & Armstrong, 1992; Prevec, Campbell, Christie, Belbeck, & Graham, 1990) . In terms of the efficacy of ONRAB\u00ae and V-RG in striped skunks and raccoons , there is no signi ficant difference in the rate of seroconversion (Fehlner -Gardiner, Rudd, Donovan, Slate, Kempf, & Badcock, 2012) . This vaccine also has a high level of safety for many wild animals, including targeted or non - targeted species, such as eastern cottontail rabbits, wood rats, eastern wild turkeys, Virginia opossums, and fox squirrels (Fry, . The third kind of oral rabies vaccine is the SAG family of vaccines. It contain s two vaccines, SAG -1 and SAG -2, which are licensed in Europe , where m ore than 80% of rabies 22 cases are reported in red foxes. Having failed in controlling the number of foxes by some conventional methods like culling or trapping to control the spread of rabies, oral vaccination was then introduced to control rabies in the wild (G. M. Baer, Abelseth, & Debbie, 1971) . Proven to be effective in 1969, the vaccine has been widely used since 1977 in Europe. SAG -1 and SAG -2 are selected from the SAD Berne strain with some mutations of the G protein SAG -2, the mutations make the strain genetic ally stable and apathogenic for adult mice, cats, dogs and foxes (Leblois, the immune efficiency and safety of the SAG -2 vaccine have been tested extensively in many animal species , including dogs, foxes, raccoons , and even Sanderlin, 1996) . DNA vaccines The DNA vaccine is a radically novel approach to vaccination. It directly introduces a plasmid containing the antigen -encoding DNA sequence to appropriate tissues to produce target antigens, which will induce immune response s. The DNA vaccine has many advantag es over conventional vaccines. With improved stability, it not only induces both B- and T -cell responses, but it also be lack the infectious agent. T he first DNA vaccine for rabies was developed in 1994 (Xiang, Spitalnik, Tran, Wunner, Cheng, & Ertl, 1994) . When animals were immunized with one dose of DNA expressing rabies virus G protein, only slow and modest VNA was induced , which is much lower than one -dose of the conventional rabies vaccine (Perrin, Yacob, & Tordo, 2000) . However , after repeated 23 immunization, the VNA responses could be improved (Perrin, Yacob, & Tordo, 2000) . In animal experiments in cats and dogs, with a moderate dose, the DNA vaccine can protect the animals from rabies virus challenge (Lodmell, . Due to the slow immune response to DNA vaccine s, it has been excluded from post -exposure use. One of the barriers that prevents the DNA vaccines from efficient antigen production in vivo is a lack of DNA uptake by cells at the inoculation site. Live RABV vaccine s The development of reverse genetics has resulted in generating more potent and safer modified -live rabies vaccines , by modifying viral elements responsible for pathogenicity and immunogenicity. Now, there are two types of live rabies vaccines, live - attenuated rabies v accine s expressing multiple copies of the G protein and live recombinant rabies vaccine s expressing cytokines or chemokines. Live -attenuated rabies vaccine s expressing multiple G proteins are generated by introducing multiple copies of the G protein into the rabies virus genome , which makes the virus less pathogenic and other hand, the cytokine or chemokine expressing vaccine s enhance immune responses by activating and recruiting mature B cells and dendritic cells (DC) into the peripheral blood and draining lymph nodes (Zhao, To riumi, Wang, Kuang, Guo, Morimoto, & Fu, 2010) . Replication -deficient R ABV-based vaccines Replication -deficient vaccine s have been developed for rabies based on safety concern s. The replication -deficient rabies vaccine s are constructed by deleting viral gene s 24 that are responsible for viral replication or assembly. There are M-deleted (M) and P- deleted ( P) single -cycle rabies virus vaccines . When cells are infected by P rabies virus , genome replication will not be observed (Shoji, Sakai, & Morimoto, 2004) . The M-deleted rabies virus loses the bullet shape of rabies virus (Mebatsion, Weiland, & Conzelmann, 1999b) . All of the replication -deficient rabies vaccines have been tested in mice and showed very good efficacy and safety. Inactivated v accine s Inactivated vaccine is the most widely -used rabies vaccine licensed and sold in the USA for domestic animals (National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians, 2011) . There are thirteen monovalent rabies vaccines for dogs and cats, two for ferrets, and some other vaccines for other species . For multivalent vaccines, there are three for dogs, cats, and horses, respectively. All of the licensed vaccines can be used interchange ably as either primary or booster vaccine s. Like all other vaccines, rabies vaccines have some adverse reactions, including injection site swelling, fever, shivering, fatigue, vomiting , and hypersensitivity (Frana, Clough, Gatewood, & Rupprecht, 2008) . The inactivated rabies vaccine from international companies, such as Intervet and Merial , are mostly used , which are all pr oducts from the developed countries. For the developing countries in Asia and Africa, the inactivated vaccines need to be imported and are thus too expensive. Rabies reservoirs From all over the world, the most important reservoir of rabies is still the dog. But the situation is different between the developed countries and the developing countries. In the developed countries , wild animals are the main reservoir for rabies . In the United State s, 25 since the 1950s, raccoons have been an important reservoir f or the spread of rabies in the southeastern r egion (Finnegan, Brookes, Johnson, Smith, Mansfield, Keene, McElhinney, & Fooks, 2002) . In other part s of the US, the skunk is an important reservoir of three strains of rabies virus (Finnegan, Brookes, Johnson, Smith, Mansfield, Keene, McElhinney, & Fooks, 2002) . In 2006, about 92% of rabies cases were from wild animals, such as raccoons, bats, foxes , and skunks (Blanton, Hanlon, & Rupprech t, 2007) . In Europe , the main reservoir s for classic RABV remains raccoon dog s and red fox es. In addition, the bat is also a principal reservoir (Chautan, Pontier, & Artois, 2000) . In general, the control of rabies has been very successful. However, in the developing or undeveloped countries, rabies cases mostly come from domestic dogs. In China, there are about 100 million dogs. It is reported that about 4.13% -17.82% of asymptomatic dogs in Sichuan and Hebei provinces are positive for rabies virus (Hu, Tang, Tang, & Fooks, 2009) . In rural areas, the high cost of vaccination and poor awareness of rabies contribute to the low vaccination coverage of dogs for rabies . It was show n that only few dogs were vaccinated in 2 of 16 villages in Shandong Province (Hu, Tang, Tang, & Fooks, 2009) . In rural areas, m ost dogs are not leashed and always roam ing in these regions, thus increasing the risk of rabies exposure (Hu, Tang, Tang, & Fooks, 2009) . Cats, domestic livestock , and wild animals are also important reservoirs . A similar situation also exists in India. There are approximately 25 million dogs , and about 80% are stray, unowned, and unprotected (Menezes, 2008) . Since the st ray dogs move around and are unrestricted, it is very difficult to catch them for vaccinatio n. 26 Difficulties and problems in rabies vaccination According to the Compendium of Animal Rabies Prevention and Control, a booster vaccin e need s to be given one year after the initial vaccination, regardless of the age of the animal. After that, booster vaccinations should be given annually or triennially as per local law ( http://www.rabiesaware.org/ ). In the developed count ries, domestic dogs and cats are immunized routinely, but require multiple vaccinations in their life. Usually , dogs are immunized initially at 3 months of age and then one year later. Subsequent booster immunization is carried out every one or three years depending on the vaccine used. Multiple vaccinations in animals not only add cost to the owners, but may also induce adverse reactions (for example, feline sarcoma). However, in the developing countries, routine vaccination of dogs is not carried out due to limited resources and a large population of stray dogs (self -sustaining reservoir). Multiple vaccination s of stray dogs are almost impossible due to problems of identification and capture. Concerns about possible adverse effects from annual vaccination have prompted debate across various pet communities and experts to reanalyze the vaccine protocols and to extend the revaccination intervals. Commercial vaccine producing companies perform studies on the duration of immunity (DOI) to ensure the minimum DOI (minDOI) for their products to guarantee that their products convey immunity for a minimum period of time . However, the maximum DOI (maxDOI) is not often carried out due to the cost associated with long-term studies. There are no experiment al or epidemiological data to support that the annual or biennial administration of 3 -year vaccines is better (National Association of State Public Health, Compendium of Animal Rabies, Control, Brown, Slavinski, Ettestad, Sidwa, & Sorhage, 2016) . 27 It is well kn own that rabies vaccination is the best way to control rabies. However, when we use the vaccine, there are also some adverse effects that may do harm to animals. In a report conducted by the Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB), nearly 10,000 cases of an adverse event have been reported for rabies vaccines during a three -year period (Frana, Clough, Gatewood, & Rupprecht, 2008) . Among these cases, about 65% are related to dogs (Frana, Clough, Gatewood, & Rupprecht, 2008) . When the vaccine is administered to dogs, in rare cases, it can lead to a deadly reaction known as anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can lead to symptoms as severe as a shock , cardiac failure , and respiratory failure. However, n ot all adverse reactions occur immediately. It can take as long as a few months for the dog to have a reaction to the vaccination. Reactions can be mild, such as skin disease or an allergic reaction near the injection site, but they can be serious. In addition to the adverse effects that are caused by the vaccine reagent itself, t here is also the possibility that the vaccines can be contaminated with other viral agents, which can result in significant untoward effects (Tizard, 1990) . From 1940 to 1946, a contaminated rabies vaccine caused 40 cases of human encephalomyelitis in California (Pait & Pearson, 1949) . Goals and objectives The main objective of this study is to evaluate the protective efficacy of rabies vaccines in dogs that are vaccinated six and eight years previously . Immunological correlates have also been investigated by evaluat ing the immune responses , particularly the production of VNA and induction of mem ory B and T cells, and activation of DCs after 28 challenge . Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for extending the current 3 year rabies booster vaccination to 6 or 8 years. 29 CHAPTER 2 METHODS Materials Personal protective equipment (PPE) was needed for dog observation , including N95 respirator (3M), 4, 0.24 g KH 2PO 4, brought to a final volume of 1 L in deionized water. TAE buffer (50 \u00d7) was made by dissolving 242g of Tris base in water, 57.1 mL glacial acetic acids, 100 mL of 500mM EDTA (pH 8.0) solution and bri nging the final volume to 1 L . Viruses and animals A canine New York (NYC) strain RABV, a challenge virus originally isolated from a rabid dog and adapted in foxes, was obtained from USDA. The l ethal dose of NYC was used in our study to challenge the dogs. The NYC virus was stored at -80\u00b0C. The dogs were all female beagles, which had been raised at Ridglan Farms. INC., Blue Mounds, WI. A group of five dogs , which had been vaccinated in the year 2007 using Merial rabies vaccine , and another group of five dogs , which had been vaccinated in the year 2009 using the Intervet rabies vaccine was included in the study. Five , unvaccinated , age-matched dogs were used as control s. 30 DNA The primer for confirmation of rabies virus was generated from the N gene , and it is 127bp. The sequence of the forward primer, Primer F, is ATCTCACCGCAAGGGAAGC , 5'-3'. The sequence of the reverse primer, , is AGT GAA CGG AAG TGG ATG AAA T , 5'-3'. Dog infection and observation Dogs were infected I .M. with New York (NYC) street rabies (1000 LD50) by direct inoculation into the left hemisphere of the temporalis muscle. Challenged dogs were observed at least once a day prior to challenge and three times a day for 90 days after challenge. The h umane endpoint of the study was considered the appearance of hind limb paralysis of one or both limbs , and the experimental endpoin t of the study was determined on the basis of observed clinical signs. Blood collection and lymph node aspiration Blood samples were collected at 0, 4, 12 and 26 dayspost-challenge for the quantification of VNA and immune responses. For blood collection, dogs were pretreated with Acepromazine (2 mg/kg). When the dogs calm ed down, they were injected with Telazol (100 mg/ mL) at 4 mg/kg using a pole-syringe . Once unconscious , the dogs were transported to the procedure room . Ten mL of blood was collected from the jugular vein . At the indicated time points, whole blood was collected from the dogs, allowed to clot overnight at 4\u00b0C, and spun down at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. Subsequently, serum was isolated for analysis. 31 Lymph node samples were collected at 4 , and 12, days post-challenge for analysis of immune responses. Under anesthesia, the left mandibular lymph node was aspirated with a 3 mL syringe with a 20G needle punctured into the lymph node and loaded in to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL of 1 \u00d7 PBS solution. Brain extraction Once the rabid dogs reached human end point s or the surviving dogs reached the 90-day study period, dogs were humanely euthanized with 5 mL euthanasia solution (Beuthanasia -D special) . Brains were ex tracted for the detection of RAB V antigen. Briefly, as soon as the dogs reached the end -point , the dogs were euthanized with euthanasia solution at 0.5 mL/kg. After the cessation of heartbeat , the dog was beheaded , and the skull was opened using a skull breaker. Then , the brain was carefully extracted using forceps. Then , extracted brain was washed thrice with sterile PBS and cut into two halves, one half was fixed in 10% formalin , and the other half was frozen in -80\u00b0C for virus isolation. Rabies virus genome confir mation by PCR Extraction of RNA In order to detect the presence of RABV genome in the brain by PCR, 50mg brain stem was collected from each sample. Then, 1 mL TRIzol\u00ae Reagent was added to the sample, grou nd with a pestle and incubated for 5 min at room temperature for complete dissociation of the protein complex. This homogenate was added to0.2 mL of chloroform. Then, the mixture was vortexed for 15 s and incubated for 3 min at room temperature. After centrifuging at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0 C, the sample was separated into three phases, 32 collecting the aqueous phase of the sample by pipetting the solution out . The aqueous phase was then added to 0.6 mL of 100% isopropanol, incubated at room temperature for 10 min , and c entrifuge d at 12,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0 C for 10 min. The RNA pellet was left at the bottom of the tube after r emov al of the supernatant. 75% ethanol was used to wash the pellet , which was then briefly vortexed and centrifuge d at 7500 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0 C. The RNA pellet was air -dried for 5 min. Then, 30L RNase -free water was added to r esuspend the RNA . The RNA sample was i ncubate d in a heat block at 55\u00b0 C for 10 min and then stored at - 80\u00b0 C. cDNA synthesis In order to synthesize cDNA of the RNA , RT-PCR was performed in two steps in a 25L volume. In the first step, 500ng of isolated RNA was added to the cDNA mixture containing 1L oligo dT 40 (10\u00b5 M), and 1L 10mM dNTP and brought upto13L using sterile distilled water. The mixture was incubated at 65\u00b0 C for 5min, and on ice for 2 min. Then, 4L of 5 \u00d7 1L Superscript II (Invitrogen) were added to the mixture. The sample was incubat ed at 55\u00b0 C for 60 min and 70\u00b0 C for 15 min . After th e completion of incubation , the cDNA products were used for PCR confirmation using RABV specific primers. PCR Distilled water was add ed to the mixture of 0.5L Ex Taq (Invitrogen) and brought up to 40L .The PCR reaction was run on a n Express Gene gradient cycler (Deville Scientific Inc. ). The PCR program used was as follows: 94\u00b0 C 5 min 35 cycles of: 33 94\u00b0 C 30s, denaturation 50\u00b0 C 30s, annealing 72\u00b0 C 30s, extension Final extension: 72\u00b0 C 5 min Detection of nucleic acids Loading buffer was added to the PCR products and run on a 1% agarose gel. 0. 5 \u00b5 g of a 1kb DNA ladder (Invitrogen) was run as a standard. Flow cytometry The blood and lymph node aspirates were collected prior to challenge and at 4 and 12 dpc. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell s (PBMC ) were isolated from 10 mL of blood using Ficoll Histopaque solution (Sigma -Aldrich). The isolation was performed according to the protocol . Briefly, 5mLof whole blood anticoagulant was gently mixed with 5 mL of 1\u00d7 PBS (pH=7.4). The 10mL diluted blood solution was overlayed on top of 5mL Ficoll - paque Plus in a 15mL centrifuge tube at room temperature and centrifuge d at 400 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 20 \u00b0C.After the centrifugation , the granulocytes, platelets , and RBCs were pellet ed to the bottom of the tube and the PBMC float ed over the Ficoll -Paque PLUS. The PBMC s were carefully aspirated from the Ficoll -plaque interface and put into a new 15 mL centrifuge tube. Five mL of 1 \u00d7 PBS were added to the tube containing PBMC s, mixed gently , and c entrifuge d at 200 \u00d7g for 10min at 20 \u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded , and 1 \u00d7 PBS was added to 15 mL to resuspend the cells , and the tube mixed gently. The tube was centrifuge d at 200 \u00d7g for 10min at 20 \u00b0C. The supernatant was discarded , and the cells were resuspend ed using the remaining 1 \u00d7 PBS solution . 34 Then, cells For surface staining, 100Lof diluted antibodies were added to each well and i ncubate d for 30min in the dark at room temperature. The plate was c entrifuge d at 400 \u00d7g for 5min, and the supernatant discarded . Then the cells were washed twice with washing buffer. One hundred L 2% formaldehyde (diluted with P BS) was added and the cells incubated for 30min at 4 \u00b0C.The cells were washed twice using the washin g buffer and r esuspend ed with 300 L staining buffer, then transferred into 5 mL flow cytometry tube s. Data collection and analysis were performed using a BD LSR CA). RFFIT (Rapid Fluorescent Focus Inhibition Test) Blood samples were collected for the measurement of VNA by the RFFIT . Briefly , 50 L of serum in serial three -fold dilutions, were added to a 96-well plate (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY). Fifty FFD50 (50%Focus Forming Dose) of CVS -11 was added to every well and incubated at 37\u00b0 C fo r 90 min. NA cells (105 cells) were added to each well and incubated in a CO 2-controlled incubator at 37\u00b0 C for 20 hours, fixed with 80% ice-cold acetone , and stained with FITC -conjugated anti -RABV N antibodies (Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc.) at 37\u00b0 C for 1 hour. In all wells, twenty fields were observed under a fluorescent microscope with a 10\u00d7 objective, and the 50% endpoint titers were calculated based on t he Reed -Muench formula. The values were compared with reference 35 serum (supplied by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Herts, UK) and normalized to international units (IU/ mL). The lower limit of detection was0.1 IU/ mL. Ethics sta tement This study was approved by the University of Georgia's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The University Research Animal Resources unit of The University of Georgia is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International (AAALAC -I). Statistical analysis Statistical significance of the differences between groups was tested with student's T-test, with * indicating a p value < 0.05, ** indicating a p value < 0.001, and *** indicating a p value < 0.0001 using GraphPad prism software. 36 CHAPTER 3 RESULTS Clinical observations Clinical signs were observed for evaluation of the process of rabies infection. Among the 15 dogs challenged with NYC street rabies virus, 5 unvaccinated dogs showed characteristic signs of rabies. In these 5 dogs, all were euthanized, 2 dogs reached the humane endpoint at 13 and 15 days post-challenge (dpc), and the remainin g 3 dogs reached the endpoint by 18 dpc. Early signs included subtle changes in behavior, such as quietness, drowsy eye contact, dilation of pupils , and loss of appetite. Later signs consisted of restless, agitation, profound salivation, and difficulty in swallowin g or drinking , poor coordination, trembling, and retching. For the dogs vaccinated 8 years ago , 4 out of 5 showed characteristic signs of rabies and reached the humane endpoint at16, 17, 19 , and 25 dpc, respective ly. For the dogs vaccinated 6 years ago , only 1 out of the 5 showed characteristic signs of rabies, at 17 dpc. All of the surviving dogs in the vaccinated groups did not show any clinical signs of rabies during the 90-day observation period. All of the surviving dogs were euthanized after the 90-day observation period. Blood samples were collected and brains extracted for analysis. VNA responses in the serum VNA titer was measured to evaluate the immune responses induced in all dogs. All of the serum samples were collected at four time points during the observation, prior to 37 challenge and at 4, 12 , and 26 dpc or at the time of euthanasia for surviving dogs. RFFIT analysis was performed on all samples to quantify the VNA. As summariz ed in Table 1, none of the dogs from any of the groups had a VNA titer equal to or higher than 0.5 IU/ mL prior to challenge, except one of the dogs that had been vaccinated 8 years ago, which had serum VNA titer of 0.5 IU/ mL. The unvaccinated dogs had an average serum VNA of 0.03, 0.056, 0.2, and 0.43 IU/ mL at 0, 4, 12 dpc and endpoints , respectively. Whereas, the dogs that had been vaccinated 8 years ago had average serum VNA of 0.13, 0.29 , and 1.77 IU/mL at 0, 4 , and 12 dpc, respectively. Four dogs that died from rabies had an average end-point serum VNA of 3.13 IU/ mL. However, the one dog that survived the lethal challenge had serum VNA of 0.5, 1.14, 7.79, 23.38 and 3.8 at 0, 4, 12, 26 dpc and at the endpoint , respectively. Six year -vaccinated dogs had an average serum VNA of 0.06, 0.13, 7.36, 10.42 , and 3.32 IU/ mL at 0, 4, 12, and 26 dpc and at the endpoint , respectively (Fig.1). In addition, one of the 6 year -vaccinated dogs that succumbed to lethal rabies challenge had an endpoint VNA of 5.9 IU/ mL. Analysis of immune responses in dogs that survived the lethal challenge showed significantly higher levels of serum VNA at all time points, except the end points. Dogs that survived the lethal challenge had an average VNA of 0.16, 0.34, 8.52, 13.01 and 2.9 0 at 0, 4, 12, and 26 dpc and at the endpoint , respectively vs. the dogs that had succumbed to rabies that had an average VNA of 0.03, 0.06, 0.4, and 2.1 IU/ mL (Fig.2). Cellular immune responses to lethal rabies infection in dogs that had been vaccinated Further, to evaluate the cellular immune responses in all dogs, the number of CD4+ Th cells , CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, memory T cells, B cells and activated DCs are measured 38 by flow cytometry. All of the blood and lymph node samples collected prior to chall enge and at 4, 12 , and 26 dpc or at the time of euthanasia for surviving dogs were analyzed by flow cytometry for the quantification of the number of CD4+ Th cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, memory T cells, B cells and activated DCs. At 4 dpc, a significant number of memory B cells were detected in dogs that were vaccinated (6 and 8 years ago) than the unvaccinated dogs, but only in lymph nodes and not in blood (Fig. 3G). No significant difference s were observed in other cell types between vaccina ted and unvaccinated controls in blood or in the lymph nodes at 4 dpc. However, in the blood at 12 dpc, significant differences in the number of memory T cells and activated DCs were detected only in dogs that had been vaccinated 6 years ago than the unvaccinated or dogs that had been vaccinated 8 years ago. Whereas, in the lymph node, significant ly more activated DCs were detected in 6 year -vaccinated dogs than the unvaccinated or dogs that had been vaccinated 8 years a go (Fig.4). Thus, cellular immune responses at 12 dpc has the best correlate s with protection against lethal rabies infection. Protection against lethal rabies challenge Survival rates were calculated to evaluate the protection efficacy. The three groups of dogs were observed for 90 days post rabies virus challenge. As expected, all of the unvaccinated dogs died from rabies. However, in accordance with the immune response data, 80% of dogs that had been vaccinated 6 years ago were protecte d, and only 20% of the dogs that were vaccinated 8 years ago survived the lethal challenge, until the end of 90 days observation period without any clinical signs of rabies infection (Fig.5). 39 Rabies virus genome con firmation by PCR in the brain In order to confirm that the dogs had all succumbed to rabies infection and there was no virus present in surviving dogs, PCR was performed on the brain samples of all dogs. Brain samples, collected when the dogs are euthanized, were analyzed for the presence of the rabies viral genome (N -gene) by RT -PCR. As presented in figure 6, all of the dogs that died from rabies showed positive results for the presence rabies N gene (127bp) in the respective brain samples and all the survival dogs showed negative results. Rabies virus B2c was used as a positive control (Fig.6). 40 CHAPTER 4 DISCUSSION Rabies is an ancient disease but still causes more than 59, 000 human fatalities each year in the world , mostly in Africa and Asia (WHO, 2013) . Although the disease is preventable through timely pre -and post -exposure vaccination , death is inevitable once clinical signs appear (Alan C. Jackson, 2013) . Rabies is transmitted to humans through animal bites, most com monly by dogs. Thus , controlling or eliminating dog rabies is always the priority. Mass vaccination of dogs has resulted in the control or elimination of canine rabies in many countries in the America s and Europe (Cliquet & Aubert, 2004; Lontai, 1997) . As a consequence, human rabies has declined dramatically during the past 50 years (Hampson, Coudeville, & Par, 2015) . In countries where cani ne rabies vaccination is not practiced routinely, rabies is still endemic, causing human fa talities. According to the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA ) Canine Vaccine Task Force guidelines, the first dose of rabies vaccine should be given to dogs between 12 to 16 weeks of age. A booster dose is given one year late r. Subsequent vaccination should be given every one or three year(s) depending on the vaccines given or as per local law (http://www.rabiesaware.org/ ). In the USA and many other countries, this regime of rabies vaccination is mandated by laws and regulations (WHO, 2 005b, 2013) . Concerns about 41 possible adverse effects from annual booster vaccination have prompted debate across various pet communities and experts to reanalyze the vaccine protocols and to extend the revaccination intervals (Frana, Clough, Gatewood, & Rupprecht, 2008) . Multiple vaccination schedules also present problems in the developing countries , where rabies is still endemic and causes huge human and financial loss es. Firstly, the cost of the vaccine is a huge burden for those countries , since most rabies vaccines used in the developing countries are imported from the developed count ries; the price is sometimes unaffordable. Secondly, there are a large number of stray dogs , and it is difficult to catch these dogs for primary and subsequent booster vaccinations rabies vaccines capabl e of inducing long -term protective immunity will not only reduce the cost and side effects associated with vaccines, but also reduce the burden for immunizing stray dogs. In the present study, the duration of immunity after a single shot was evaluated in dogs , and it was found that dogs that had received a single shot of rabies vaccine at three months of age could be protected for up to six years. Our results show that the single shot of rabies vaccine can protect dogs for up to six years. Previous studies by Aubert have shown that the DOI against rabies is five years by challenge and seven years by serological studies (Aubert, 1992) . In their study, none of the dogs had detectable antibodies before challenge ; however, more than 90% of the dogs survived (Aubert, 1992) . Likewise , most of our dogs did not have detectable VNA prior to challenge in the group immuni zed 6 years ago, yet 80% of the dogs survived. E valuation of long -term protective immune responses in our study indicates that the dogs that had been vaccinated 6 and 8 years ago are capable of inducing memory B cell responses and a high 42 level of VNA production. However, only 20% of the 8 years vaccinated dogs were protected against lethal challenge, indicating the maximum dura tion of protection could only be up to 6 years. Further, this is the first report on memory B and T cells i n rabies-challenged dogs. Evaluation of cellular immune responses shows that the dogs that had been vaccinated six and eight years ago are capable of inducing the early generation of memory B cells than the unvaccinated dogs. This clearly indicates that the memo ry recall immune responses are not greatly affected by the duration of vaccination per se . However, the early induction of memory B cells was maintained only in the dogs immunized 6 years ago, along with memory T cells and activated DCs. Further, the maintenance of memory B cells contributed to the significant production of VNA and thereby better protection against lethal challenge. Whereas, in the 8-year vaccinated dogs , early activation of memory B cells quickly wane d off at 12 dpc, thus, they were unable to mount protective immune responses a gainst lethal challenge. I t is possible that t he insufficient and un sustainable immune responses observed in the eight year -vaccinated dogs could be due to age-related immune exhaustion, rather than due to the lo nger duration of immunization. Various studies have shown aging associated changes in cellular and humoral immunity in humans, as well as in dogs (J. Wu, Li, Liu, Zhang, Peng, Feng, Li, Wang, Liu, Li, & Liu, 2012) . Decrease d activity of Th cells, CTL s, and NK cells, and tumo ricidal activities have been reported in aged dogs (J. Wu, Li, Liu, Zhang, Peng, Feng, Li, Wang, Liu, Li, & Liu, 2012) . Further st udies are warranted to rule out the age-related immune responses. However, the lethal challenge in six and eight -year rabies -vaccinated dogs indica te that the duration of protective immunit y can be up to six years. 43 The long DOI for rabies protection could greatly benefit societies in terms of controlling canine and human rabies all over the word. For developed countries, the six - year-long protective period helps to reduce the frequency of booster vaccination s. Along with the reduction of revaccination, time and money will be saved and adverse reactions reduced. Our studies will help regulatory agencies to consider whether to extend the boos ter vaccination from three years to six years. For developing countries, the large number of stray dogs is a tough problem (Menezes, 2008) . Due to animal welfare and religious concerns, the population o f stray dogs is not easy to control (Menezes, 2008) . Thus, vaccination needs to be performed to control rabies among the stray dogs. Because of the long DOI of the current vaccines , vaccinati on of stray dogs can become easier without the need for subsequent booster vaccinations. When the ratio of vaccinated stray dogs reaches 70%, the herd immunity is formed (Thulke & Eisinger, 2008) . Thus, the six- year-long protect ive period provides a means to c ontrol rabies in the stray dog population . The control of rabies in stray dogs will defi nitely decrease the cases of human rabies since most of the human cases are caused by dog bite s in developing countries (Ichhpujani, Bhardwaj, Chhabra, & Datta, 2001) . The current data have demonstrated that protective immunity can last up to 6 years after a single shot of rabies vaccine . Developed countries will benefit in the cost of ra ising pets and animal welfare , while developing countries can have a better control of rabies by vaccinating stray dogs ; thus, human rabies cases will decrease. 44 REFERE NCES Akira, S., Yamamoto, M., & Takeda, K.
