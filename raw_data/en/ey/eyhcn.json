Prevalence and Incidence of HIV Bulletin September 9, 2013. An HIV/AIDS vaccine candidate being developed by researchers at Oregon Health and Science University appears to have the ability to completely clear an AIDS-causing virus from the body. \"To date, HIV infection has only been cured in a very small number of highly publicized but unusual clinical cases in which HIV-infected individuals were treated with antiviral medicines very early after the onset of infection or [were given] a stem cell transplant to combat cancer. This latest research suggests that certain immune responses elicited by a new vaccine may also have the ability to completely remove HIV from the body,\" according to Louis Picker, associate director of the Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute at OHSU. (See Module 8.)For the y ear 2011 the United Nations estimated 34 million people worldwide were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and about 2.5 million became newly infected. Progress against the disease o ver the past ten y ears has been unev en. Twenty- five countries ha ve seen more than a 50% drop in infections since 2001, and there w as a 42% drop in the Caribbean, which is the second most affected region in the world. Unfortunately , Howev er, in the Middle East and North Africa the number of new infections increased by more than 35%, and Eastern Europe and Centr al Asia ha ve also seen increases (UNAIDS , 2012). Worldwide, deaths related to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), the final stage of HIV -infection, ha ve decreased b y 24% since 2005, and in 2011 were appro ximately 1.7 million. Howev er, increases in those deaths occurred in the same regions that experienced an increase in new HIV infections: the Middle East, North Africa, Eastern Europe, and Centr al Asia (UNAIDS , 2012). Data are incomplete as of 2013, but the United Nations estimated that in 2013 in the United States there would be appro ximately 1.3 million people living with HIV \u2014about 1 million men and 300,000 women. The United Nations also estimated that 20,000 Americans would die from AIDS in 2013 (UNAIDS , 2013). Through the end of 2010, Florida r anked third in the nation with 121,161 AIDS cases reported. In 2011 Florida w as second among the states in numbers of new cases of HIV infection diagnosed, and third in the number of AIDS cases. Florida has fiv e large metropolitan areas that ha ve more AIDS cases individually than man y states do as a whole. In 2012, 5,388 cases of HIV infection and 2,775 AIDS cases were reported among adults; both numbers reflected a small drop o ver those from 2011. Women accounted for 22% of the 2012 HIV cases and 29% of the AIDS diagnoses, and the percentage of cases among females has been decreasing o ver the past ten y ears. The new AIDS cases reported were 54% black, 24% white, and 21% Hispanic, and these proportions ha ve changed little o ver the past ten y ears (FDOH, 2012). Hispanics, who mak e up 22% of Florida' s adult population, comprise 23% of the HIV cases and 21% of the AIDS cases (proportional to the Hispanic population). Blacks represent only 14% of Florida' s adult population, howev er they account for 44% of the adult HIV -infection cases and 53% of the adult AIDS cases reported in 2012. Black men\u2014 and especially black women\u2014 are significantly o ver-represented in these statistics, with the HIV case r ate among black women 15 times that among white women (FDOH, 2012).HIV Virus The physical structure of HIV is characterized by a protein shell encapsulating the genetic information and enzymes of the virus; a lipid membrane that circles the protein capsule; and glycoproteins that dot the surface of the virus, which aid in processes such as entry into macrophages and T-helper cells of the host. Illustration provided by 3DScience.com.Since the peak y ear of 1995 there has been a 79% decline in deaths of Florida residents due to HIV disease. The number has continued to decline since 2007, and in 2012 there were 923 HIV -related deaths. Howev er, HIV is still the sixth leading cause of death for 25- to 44- year-olds. F or blacks it is the fourth leading cause of death, ha ving fallen from first in 2010 for the first time since 1988 (FDOH, 2012.) HIV Infection and Transmission Cause of HIV The human immunodeficiency virus kills or impairs the cells of the immune system and progressiv ely destro ys the body' s ability to protect itself . Over time, a person with a deficient immune system ( immunodeficiency ) may become vulner able to infections b y disease-causing organisms such as bacteria or viruses. These infections can become life-threatening. The term AIDS stands for \"acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, \" and it refers only to the most adv anced stage of HIV infection. Medical treatment can dela y the onset of AIDS , but HIV infection ev entually results in a syndrome (combination) of symptoms, diseases, and infections. The diagnosis of AIDS requires evidence of HIV infection and the appear ance of some specific additional conditions or diseases. Only a licensed medical pro vider can mak e an AIDS diagnosis. Surveillance Case Definitions (rev. 2008) In December 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC) published Revised Surveillance Case Definitions for HIV Infection Among Adults, Adolescents, and Children Aged <18 Months and for HIV Infection and AIDS Among Children Aged 18 Months to <13 Years . For adults and adolescents (people 13 y ears or older), the surv eillance case definitions for HIV infection and AIDS were revised into a single case definition that includes AIDS and incorpor ates a system for staging HIV -infection. In addition, the HIV case definition for children o ver 13 y ears old and the AIDS definition for children aged 18 months to 13 y ears were revised.No changes were made to the HIV classification system, the 24 AIDS-defining conditions for children older than 13 y ears, or the AIDS definition for children o ver 18 months of age (CDC 2013, CDC 2008). A confirmed case meets the labor atory criteria for diagnosis of HIV infection and one of the four HIV infection stages (stage 1, stage 2, stage 3, or stage unknown). HIV infection, stage 1: No AIDS-defining condition and either CD4+ T -lymphocyte count of 500 cells/\u00b5L or CD4+ T -lymphocyte percentage of total lymphocytes of 29. HIV infection, stage 2: No AIDS-defining condition and either CD4+ T -lymphocyte count of 200-499 cells/\u00b5L or CD4+ T -lymphocyte percentage of total lymphocytes 14-28. HIV infection, stage 3 (AIDS): count <200 percentage of total lymphocytes of <14, or documentation of an AIDS- defining condition. Documentation of an AIDS-defining condition supersedes the laboratory definitions here. HIV infection, stage unknown: No information a vailable on CD4+ T -lymphocyte count or percentage and no information a vailable on AIDS-defining conditions (CDC 2013, CDC 2008) AIDS-Defining Conditions Bacterial infections, multiple or recurrent* Candidiasis of bronchi, tr achea, or Cytomegalo virus disease (other than liv er, spleen, or nodes), onset at age >1 month Cytomegalo virus retinitis (with loss of vision) Encephalopath y, HIV related Herpes simplex: chronic ulcers (>1 month' s duration) or or esophagitis >1 Mycobacterium complex or My cobacterium kansasii, disseminated or extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis of an y site, pulmonary , disseminated, or extrapulmonary Mycobacterium, other species or unidentified species, disseminated or extrapulmonary vecii pneumonia Pneumonia, recurrent oencephalopath y Salmonella septicemia, recurrent Toxoplasmosis of br ain, onset at age >1 month Wasting syndrome attributed to HIV \u00a7 \u00a7 \u00a7 *Only among children aged <13 years.

HIV enters the bloodstream and seeks out T-helper lymphocytes, white blood cells essential to the functioning of the immune system. One of the functions of these cells is to regulate the immune response in the event of attack from disease-causing organisms such as bacteria or viruses. When the virus infects the T-helper lymphocyte, the cell sends signals to other cells, which produce antibodies. This T-helper lymphocyte cell is also called the T4 or the CD4 cell. HIV Entry into T CellThe top panel shows the HIV virion finding and attaching to a T cell. The second and third panels show HIV viruses (dotted with red glycoproteins) attaching to the T cell and depositing the HIV virus particle into it.

A person with untreated HIV infection experiences sev eral stages of infection: Viral transmission Primary HIV infection \u2014lasting 1 to 2 weeks as the virus establishes itself in the body. Seroconversion \u2014the point when antibodies to the HIV virus produced b y the immune system are able to be identified b y labor atory test. Asymptomatic HIV infection \u2014a person is infectious but looks and feels health y. The virus is activ e and continuing to damage the immune system.Symptomatic HIV infection\u2014 symptoms such as skin r ash, night sweats, mouth ulcers, weight loss, and fungal infections appear . AIDS \u2014the CDC defines AIDS as an HIV -positiv e person who has a CD4+ T - lymphocyte count of <200 cells/\u00b5L or CD4+ T -lymphocyte percentage of total lymphocytes of <14, or documentation of an \" AIDS-defining condition. \" These stages are sometimes called the \"natur al history\" of disease progression. The natur al history of HIV infection has been altered dr amatically in dev eloped countries because of new medications. In countries where there is no access to these expensiv e medications, or in cases where people do not become a ware of their HIV infection until v ery late, the disease progresses as described abo ve (WSDOH, 2007). HIV is a relativ ely fragile virus, which is not spread b y casual contact. HIV is not easy to \"catch\"\u2014it must be acquired. In order for HIV to be tr ansmitted, there must be: An HIV source . A sufficient dose of virus . Access to the bloodstream of another person . One of the predictors of the infectious lev el of an HIV -positiv e person is vir al load\u2014how much HIV is present in the bloodstream. Studies show a clear connection between higher viral load in the blood and increased tr ansmissibilit y of HIV . HIV is tr ansmitted through: Unprotected anal, v aginal, and or al intercourse Sharing needles or other injection equipment A mother passing the virus to her bab y either before or during birth An infected woman breastfeeding her infant Accidental needlestick injuries, or infected body fluid coming into contact with the broken skin or mucous membr anes of another person (as with healthcare work ers) A transfusion prior to 1986 of HIV -infected blood or blood products In extremely r are cases, HIV can be tr ansmitted b y sharing r azors or toothbrushes, if infected blood from one person w as deposited on the toothbrush or r azor and the blood entered the bloodstream of another person.In settings such as hospital oper ating rooms, other fluids\u2014cerebrospinal fluid, syno vial fluid, pleur al fluid, pericardial fluid, amniotic fluid\u2014ma y be considered infectious if the source is HIV -positiv e. These fluids are gener ally not found outside the hospital setting. Therefore, the most common body fluids considered potentially infectious for HIV are blood, semen, v aginal secretions, and breast milk. HIV tr ansmission ma y occur during pr actices such as tattooing, blood-sharing activities such as \"blood brother \" rituals or an y other t ype of ritualistic ceremonies where blood is exchanged, or when unsteriliz ed equipment contaminated with blood is shared. HIV transmission ma y also occur in occupational settings. People Unaware of Their Positive Status People who are infected with HIV come from all r aces, countries, sexual orientations, genders, and income lev els. Globally , most of the people who are infected with HIV ha ve not been tested and are una ware that they are living with the virus. The CDC estimates that, in 2009, 18% of those in the United States who had HIV were una ware that they were living with the virus. This is a decline from the 25% measured in 2003 and is a positiv e sign because research shows that most individuals who know they are infected with HIV will reduce beha viors that could tr ansmit the virus (CDCNPIN, 2012). It is important to note that the great majorit y of people with HIV infection do not tr ansmit HIV to others. The CDC estimates that in 2006 there were 5 tr ansmissions per 100 persons living with HIV infection. This means that at least 95% of those living with HIV infection did not tr ansmit the virus to others that y ear. This represents an 89% decline in the estimated rate of tr ansmission since the peak lev el of new infections in the mid-1980s. It is believ ed that the decline is due to effectiv e prev ention efforts and the a vailabilit y of impro ved testing and treatments for HIV (CDCNPIN, 2012). Pregnant Women An HIV -infected woman ma y transmit the virus to her bab y during pregnancy , during the birth process, or following pregnancy b y breastfeeding. One of the predictors of how infectious the woman will be to her bab y is her vir al load (how much HIV is present in her bloodstream). W omen with new or recent infections or people in later stages of AIDS tend to have higher vir al loads and ma y be more infectious.HIV is tr ansmitted from an HIV -infected woman to her bab y in about 25% of pregnancies if interv ention with antiretro viral medications does not occur . The perinatal tr ansmission r ate has dropped dr amatically in the United States due to the widespread use of AZT b y HIV - infected pregnant women. When a woman' s health is monitored closely and she receiv es a combination of antiretro viral ther apies during pregnancy , the risk of HIV tr ansmission to the newborn drops below 2%. In some pregnancies, cesarean section (C -section) ma y be recommended to reduce the risk of tr ansmission from woman to bab y. Advice about medications and C -section should be giv en on an individual basis b y a medical pro vider with experience in treating HIV - positiv e pregnant women. Most states, including Florida, require pregnant women to be counseled regarding risks around HIV and offered v oluntary HIV testing. HIV Testing The first HIV antibody test became a vailable in 1985. Since then, new HIV antibody tests have been dev eloped and appro ved by the F ood and Drug Administr ation (FDA). Currently , these antibody tests in volve a two-step process utilizing a screening test and, when the screening test is reactiv e (positiv e), a confirmatory test . Those who ha ve put themselv es at risk through anal, v aginal, or or al sex, or shared needles, and an yone who has had an occupational exposure ma y benefit from HIV testing. People ma y have partners with risk factors, and these people (along with their partners) should consider testing. F or occupational exposure, refer to y our emplo yer protocol or to Module 5 of this course. New drug ther apies for HIV infection can sustain an infected person' s health for long periods of time. Early detection allows people with HIV the option to receiv e medical treatment sooner , take better care of their immune system, and sta y healthier longer . Additionally , early detection of HIV allows people to tak e precautions not to infect others. The Window Period It is important to remember that HIV antibody testing has a window period. The window period is the time between infection with the virus and when the HIV -infected person develops enough antibodies to be detected b y the antibody test. Until the infected person' s immune system mak es enough antibodies to be detected, the test will be negativ e even though the person is infected with HIV .Unfortunately , there is no w ay to know how long each infected person will tak e to dev elop antibodies. Some infected people are able to produce antibodies as early as 2 weeks after infection and almost ev eryone will dev elop enough antibodies to be detected b y 12 weeks (3 months) after infection. Therefore, to be sure, people should test 3 months after the last potential HIV exposure. Because people who are newly infected ha ve so few antibodies to fight HIV , the virus can grow and multiply uncheck ed. During this time, they can ha ve a large amount of virus in their blood, making them highly infectious for HIV . During the window period it is possible for an infected person to test negativ e (before they dev elop antibodies) but still be able to infect another person. Confidential and Anonymous Testing HIV testing can only be done with the person' s consent. Consent ma y be contained within a comprehensiv e consent for medical treatment. It can be v erbal or written, but must be specific to HIV and must be documented. There are some r are ex ceptions where a person can be tested without their consent. With confidential HIV testing, the clients giv e their real name and the information about the testing is maintained in their medical records. The results are confidential. R esults and testing information are not released to others ex cept when medically necessary or under special circumstances including when a release is signed for the results to be giv en to another person or agency . HIV is a reportable condition in most states\u2014including Florida\u2014 so confidential HIV results are reported to local public health officials. Anonymous HIV antibody testing\u2014 where clients do not giv e their name and the person who orders or performs the test maintains no record of the name of the person being tested\u2014is also a vailable in Florida. As part of the informed consent process, a test subject must also be giv en information on the a vailabilit y and location of anon ymous test sites. Each count y health department maintains a list of a vailable anon ymous test sites to be disseminated to all people and progr ams offering HIV testing within their service area (FDOH, 2010). HIV Antibody Tests The first HIV antibody test became a vailable in 1985. Since then, new HIV antibody tests have been dev eloped and appro ved by the F ood and Drug Administr ation (FDA). Currently , these antibody tests in volve a two-step process utilizing a screening test and, when the screening test is reactiv e (positiv e), a confirmatory test.Step 1: Screening Test The first test done on a specimen is a screening test called an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test (ELISA, or EIA ). This t ype of test screens for the presence of antibodies to HIV in blood, urine, or or al fluid. Screening tests are inexpensiv e and highly accur ate. Most HIV antibody screening tests are con ventional, in that the specimen is collected from the client and sent to a labor atory for testing. If a screening test is negativ e (no antibodies detected), the results can be released to the client. If the screening test is reactiv e (positiv e) at the labor atory, a confirmatory Western Blot test is conducted on the same sample. Rapid tests are also screening tests, but they are conducted at the test site, often with the client present, and negativ e results are a vailable in under an hour . Reactiv e (antibodies detected) results from a r apid test must be confirmed. This is done because there is a small chance that an HIV screening test ma y detect proteins related to other autoimmune diseases and react to those proteins with a positiv e result.HIV Rapid Test Kit Contents of the CAPI LLUS HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Test Kit that tests whole blood, serum, or plasma. Source: CD C.Step 2: Confirmatory Testing If a rapid test is reactiv e, an additional specimen must be dr awn from the client and sent to the lab for confirmatory W estern Blot testing. The HIV W estern Blot detects antibodies to the individual proteins that mak e up HIV . This test is much more specific, and more costly , than the ELIS A screening test. Rapid HIV Test The rapid test is an immunoassa y used for screening and it produces quick results, in 20 minutes or less. R apid tests use blood or or al fluid to look for antibodies to HIV . If an immunoassa y (lab test or r apid test) is conducted during the window period (ie, the period after exposure but before the test can find antibodies), the test ma y not find antibodies and ma y give a false negativ e result. All immunoassa ys that are positiv e need a followup test to confirm the result (CDC, 2013b). Information about FDA - appro ved tests and their use in v arious settings is available through the CDC website. Home HIV Test Currently there are only two home HIV tests: Or aQuick In-home HIV test and the Home Access HIV -1 Test System. If y ou buy y our HIV home test online mak e sure it is FDA - appro ved (CDC, 2013b). The Or aQuick In-Home HIV T est pro vides r apid results in the home. The testing procedure involves sw abbing y our mouth for an or al fluid sample and using a kit to test it. R esults are available in 20 minutes. If y ou test positiv e, you will need a followup test. The manufacturer pro vides confidential counseling and referr al to followup testing sites. Because the lev el of antibody in or al fluid is lower than it is in blood, blood tests find infection earlier than or al fluid tests. Up to 1 in 12 people ma y test false negativ e with or al fluid tests (CDC, 2013b). The Home HIV Access HIV -1 Test System is a home collection kit that in volves pricking your finger to collect a blood sample, sending the sample to a licensed labor atory, then calling in for results a few da ys later . If the blood tests positiv e, a followup test is performed right a way. This test is anon ymous. The manufacturer pro vides confidential counseling and referr al to treatment. The tests conducted on the sample collected at home find infection later than most lab-based tests offered b y providers (CDC, 2013b).A positiv e test result means y ou are HIV positiv e and can infect others who come in contact with y our blood, semen, or v aginal fluids. A negativ e result means there are no antibodies to HIV in y our blood at the time of the test. A negativ e test does not mean y ou are HIV negativ e\u2014you ma y be infected but be in the \"window period\"\u2014 a period lasting up to 6 months in which an infected person has no detectable antibodies in their blood. Counseling In most states, HIV test counseling is offered to clients who are at risk for HIV or who request counseling. The goal of HIV counseling is help individuals assess risk, understand test results, and dev elop a personaliz ed prev ention plan. Florida la w requires those who perform HIV tests in count y health departments and other registered testing sites obtain the informed consent of the test subject, confirm positiv e preliminary results with a supplemental test before informing the test subject of the result (except as pro vided for b y statute), and mak e a reasonable attempt to notif y the test subject of the test result. Although Florida la w no longer requires pre-test counseling\u2014 except in the case of a pro vider who attends a pregnant woman for conditions related to her pregnancy \u2014the Department of Health recommends that HIV testing be preceded b y a pre-test counseling session that includes test purpose and procedures, information about infection and tr ansmission, r amifications of a positiv e test, reducing risky beha vior, available support services, and information on how to obtain test results (FDOH, 2010, 2010b) Florida la w also no longer requires face-to-face post -test counseling; howev er, it does require that when test results are pro vided the following be included: For positiv es, information on prev enting tr ansmission of HIV , on the a vailabilit y of appropriate medical and support services, and on the importance of notif ying sex and/or needle-sharing partners who ma y have been exposed. Pro viders must mak e a good faith effort to ensure that spouses and former spouses (from the past 10 y ears) of HIV -infected people are notified that they ma y have been exposed to HIV infection. For negativ es, information on prev enting the tr ansmission of HIV , if appropriate. The Department of Health still recommends that face-to-face post -test counseling be provided and that it include: information about the meaning of the test results, potential consequences of a positiv e result, need for retesting and risk reev aluation, support services, elimination of virus tr ansmission, tuberculosis, and all appropriate referr als.When a pregnant woman tests positiv e for HIV , in addition to medical and support services, she should also be referred to the Health y Start Care Coordination S ystem. F or more information on the a vailabilit y of services, contact the F amily Health Line at 800 451-BABY or the Florida AIDS Hotline at 800 FLA -AIDS (FDOH, 2010, 2010b). HIV Infection Control in Healthcare Facilities Preventing HIV infection is a univ ersal goal, and within healthcare facilities prev ention is an important component of an y infection control progr am. En vironmental control factors, engineering and work pr actice controls, as well as tr aining and education of healthcare workers are all part of a comprehensiv e infection prev ention progr am. Universal Precautions w as a system designed to prev ent tr ansmission of bloodborne pathogens in healthcare and other settings. Under Univ ersal Precautions, blood/OPIM of all patients would alw ays be considered potentially infectious for HIV and other pathogens. Standard Precautions is the preferred, newer system because it considers all body fluids except sweat to be potentially infectious. Standard Precautions (and Univ ersal Precautions) in volve the use of protectiv e barriers\u2014 defined in the following section\u2014to reduce the risk of exposure of the emplo yee's skin or mucous membr anes to OPIM. It is also recommended that all healthcare work ers tak e precautions to prev ent injuries caused b y needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments or devices. Both Standard and Univ ersal Precautions apply to blood and OPIM. Hand Hygiene Hand h ygiene is the single most important procedure for prev enting the spread of infections, and strict adherence protects both patients and work ers. Despite its simplicit y and effectiv eness in prev enting the spread of infectious disease, hand h ygiene adherence remains unacceptably low throughout the world. Adherence v aries among professional categories of healthcare work ers and between hospital departments but is usually estimated as less than 50% (Pittet, 2001). Hand h ygiene should be done when y ou first come on dut y, before y ou touch an y clean equipment, and before and after ev ery patient contact, including after touching intact skin. Hand h ygiene should be performed after contact with body fluids, including y our own\u2014for example, after coughing, sneezing, or blowing y our nose. In addition, perform hand hygiene: Before an y clean or in vasive procedure.Before contact with an y portal of entry , your patient 's or y our own. Before putting on sterile glo ves. Before and after eating. Each time y ou remo ve your glo ves. When lea ving an isolation room. When going from a dirtier to a cleaner part of the patient 's body . When y our hands feel or look dirt y. After contact with contaminated things or en vironments, such as charts. After handling used equipment or linen. After using the bathroom. If you can see dirt on y our hands\u2014 whether from blood, body fluid, or something else\u2014 wash y our hands with soap and w ater. Washing with soap and w ater ph ysically remo ves the dirt from y our hands but does not kill germs. Alcohol products kill most germs\u2014including viruses\u2014but they do not remo ve dirt and debris from y our hands. If y ou use alcohol choose a product that contains alcohol as part of its o verall formulary \u2014plain alcohol should not be used because it ev aporates too quickly to pro vide enough contact time to kill germs. It is also advisable to k eep fingernails short and to wear a minimum of jewelry (CDC, 2002). Personal Protective Equipment The Occupational Safet y and Health Administr ation (OSHA) defines personal protectiv e equipment (PPE) as \"specializ ed clothing or equipment worn b y an emplo yee for protection against infectious materials. \" Gloves, masks, protectiv e eyewear , and chin-length plastic face shields are examples of personal protectiv e equipment (PPE). PPE shall be pro vided and worn b y emplo yees in all instances where they ma y come into contact with blood or OPIM. This includes but is not limited to dentistry , phlebotom y, or processing of an y bodily fluid specimen, as well as postmortem (after death) procedures. Traditionally , latex glo ves ha ve been advised for use when dealing with blood or OPIM. Howev er, some people are allergic to latex. In most circumstances, nitrile, vin yl, and other glove alternativ es meet the definition of \"appropriate\" glo ves and ma y be used in place of latex glo ves. Emplo yers are required to pro vide non-latex alternativ es to emplo yees with latex and other sensitivities. R eusable PPE must be cleaned and decontaminated, or laundered, b y the emplo yer.Biohazard LabelLab coats and scrubs are gener ally considered to be worn as uniforms or personal clothing. When contamination is reasonably lik ely, protectiv e gowns should be worn. If lab coats or scrubs are worn as PPE, they must be remo ved as soon as pr actical and laundered b y the emplo yer. Percutaneous Exposures Percutaneous exposure incidents (needlestick, sharp injuries, as well as splashes leading to exposure of the skin or mucosa to blood) are a potential mode of exposure to\u2014 and transmission of \u2014bloodborne infectious diseases among healthcare work ers. According to the CDC, appro ximately 600,000 healthcare work ers in the United States experience exposures to blood each y ear. These can occur in an y department and ma y be related to faulty needle insertion techniques, needle recapping, or incautious disposal of contaminated needles and sharps. Needlestick and sharp injuries ma y be combined with failure to use appropriate barrier garments (for example, hand glo ves of proper siz e) (Falagas et al. , 2007). Because injuries from needles and other sharps ha ve been associated with tr ansmission of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and HIV , the prev ention of sharps injuries is an essential goal of Standard (and Univ ersal) Precautions. Needles and other sharp devices should be handled in a manner that will prev ent injury to the user and to others who ma y encounter the device during or after routine patient care. F or additional information about these exposures, their prev ention, and treatment consult the CDC' s Bloodborne Infectious Diseases website here. Needles are not to be recapped, purposely bent or brok en, remo ved, or otherwise manipulated b y hand. After they are used, disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items are to be immediately placed in puncture-resistant, labeled containers for disposal. Phlebotom y needles must not be remo ved from holders unless required b y a medical procedure. The intact phlebotom y needle/holder must be placed directly into an appropriate sharps container . Tags and LabelsTags or labels must be used to protect emplo yees from exposure to potentially hazardous biologic agents. T ags must contain a signal word (BIOHAZARD) or the biohazard symbol and a major message. The major message must indicate the specific hazardous condition or the instruction to the emplo yee. The signal word must be readable at a minimum of fiv e feet or such greater distance as w arranted b y the hazard. The tag' s major message must be presented in either pictogr aphs, written text, or both. The signal word and the major message must be understandable to all emplo yees who may be exposed to the identified hazard. All emplo yees will be informed as to the meaning of the v arious tags used throughout the workplace and what special precautions are necessary . Personal Activities Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm, and handling contact lenses are prohibited in work areas that carry occupational exposure. F ood and drink must not be stored in refriger ators, freez ers, or cabinets where blood or OPIM are stored, or in other areas. Managing Occupational Exposures to HIV Risk of Bloodborne Infection The need to protect healthcare work ers from bloodborne exposures resulted in the publication of the Bloodborne P athogens Standard b y the Occupational Safet y and Health Administr ation (OSHA) in 1991. The Standard requires emplo yers whose emplo yees ha ve exposure to blood to pro vide safe work pr actices, education, and barriers to exposure. The Standard w as later amended to add requirements for the safe use of sharps devices. Part of the OSHA Bloodborne P athogens Standard is the requirement that ev ery healthcare worker who ma y have contact with body fluids on the job must receiv e specific annual education. This education includes: Instruction in the basics of infection control and prev ention Bloodborne pathogens tr aining Instruction in modes of tr ansmission, needlestick precautions, and contact precautionsAn occupational exposure to a bloodborne pathogen is defined as a percutaneous injury (eg, a needlestick or cut with a sharp object) or contact of mucous membr ane or non- intact skin (eg, exposed skin that is chapped, abr aded, or afflicted with dermatitis) with blood, tissue, or OPIM. According to the CDC, the risk of infection v aries case b y case. F actors influencing the risk of infection include: whether the exposure w as from a hollow -bore needle or other sharp instrument; to non-intact skin or mucus membr ane (such as the ey es, nose, and/or mouth); the amount of blood that w as involved, and the amount of virus present in the source' s blood. Risk of HIV Transmission The risk of HIV infection to a healthcare work er through a needlestick is less than 1%. Appro ximately 1 in 300 exposures through a needle or sharp instrument result in infection. The risks of HIV infection though splashes of blood to the ey es, nose, or mouth is ev en smaller \u2014appro ximately 1 in 1,000. There ha ve been no reports of HIV tr ansmission from blood contact with intact skin. There is a theoretical risk of blood contact to an area of skin that is damaged, or from a large area of skin co vered in blood for a long period of time. Through December 2001, the CDC reported 57 documented cases of occupational HIV transmission to healthcare work ers in the United States, and no confirmed cases since 1999 (CDC, 2011a). Risk of Hep atitis B a nd C Transmission The risk of getting hepatitis B (HBV) from a needlestick is 22% to 31% if the source person tests positiv e for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). If the source person is HBsAg-positiv e and HBeAg-negativ e there is a 1% to 6% risk of getting HBV unless the person exposed has been v accinated. The risk of getting hepatitis C (HCV) from a needlestick is 1.8%. The risk of getting HBV or HCV from a blood splash to the ey es, nose, or mouth is possible but believ ed to be v ery small. As of 1999 about 800 healthcare work ers a y ear are reported to be infected with HBV following occupational exposure. There are no exact estimates on how man y healthcare work ers contr act HCV from an occupational exposure, but the risk is considered low. Treatment After a Potential ExposureFollow the protocol of y our emplo yer. As soon as safely possible, w ash the affected area(s) with soap and w ater. Application of antiseptics should not be a substitute for w ashing. It is recommended that an y potentially contaminated clothing be remo ved as soon as possible. It is also recommended that y ou familiariz e yourself with existing protocols and the location of emergency ey ewash or showers and other stations within y our facilit y. Mucous Membrane Exposure If there is exposure to the ey es, nose, or mouth, flush thoroughly with w ater, saline, or sterile irrigants. The risk of contr acting HIV through this t ype of exposure is estimated to be 0.09%. Sharps Injuries Wash the exposed area with soap and w ater. Do not \"milk\" or squeez e the wound. There is no evidence that shows using antiseptics (lik e hydrogen pero xide) will reduce the risk of transmission for an y bloodborne pathogens; howev er, the use of antiseptics is not contraindicated. In the ev ent that the wound needs suturing, emergency treatment should be obtained. The risk of contr acting HIV from this t ype of exposure is estimated to be 0.3%. Bite or Scratch Wounds Exposure to saliv a is not considered substantial unless there is visible contamination with blood or the saliv a emanates from a dental procedure. W ash the area with soap and w ater, and co ver with a sterile dressing as appropriate. All bites should be ev aluated b y a healthcare professional. Did you know . . . For human bites, the clinical ev aluation must include the possibilit y that both the person bitten and the person who inflicted the bite were exposed to bloodborne pathogens. Exposure to Urine, Vomitus, or Feces Exposure to urine, feces, v omitus, or sputum is not considered a potential bloodborne pathogens exposure unless the fluid is visibly contaminated with blood. F ollow y our emplo yer's procedures for cleaning these fluids. Reporting the ExposureFollow the protocol of y our emplo yer. After cleaning the exposed area as recommended above, report the exposure to the department (or individual) at y our workplace that is responsible for managing exposure. Obtain medical ev aluation as soon as possible. Discuss with a healthcare professional the extent of the exposure, treatment, followup care, personal prev ention measures, and the need for a tetanus shot or other care. Your emplo yer is required to pro vide an appropriate post exposure management referr al at no cost to y ou. In addition, y our emplo yer must pro vide the following information to the evaluating healthcare professional: A description of the job duties the exposed emplo yee was performing when exposed Documentation of the routes of exposure and circumstances under which exposure occurred Results of the source person' s blood testing, if a vailable All medical records that y ou are responsible to maintain, including v accination status, relevant to the appropriate treatment of the emplo yee Remember that HIV and hepatitis infection are notifiable conditions. Post Exposure Prophylaxis Post exposure proph ylaxis (PEP) pro vides anti-HIV medications to someone who has had a substantial exposure, usually to blood. PEP has been the standard of care for occupationally exposed healthcare work ers with substantial exposures since 1996. Animal models suggest that cellular HIV infection happens within 2 da ys of exposure to HIV and the virus in blood is detectable within 5 da ys. Therefore, PEP should be started as soon as possible, within hours not da ys, after exposure and continued for 28 da ys. Howev er, PEP for HIV does not pro vide prev ention of other bloodborne diseases lik e HBV or HCV . Hepatitis B PEP for susceptible people would include administr ation of hepatitis B immune globulin and HBV v accine. This should occur as soon as possible and no later than 7 da ys post exposure. The benefit of the use of antivir al agents to prev ent HCV infection is unknown and antivir als are not currently FDA -appro ved for proph ylaxis. Because of the frequent advances in treatment, doses and medications are not listed here. P ost exposure proph ylaxis can only be obtained from a licensed healthcare pro vider. Your facilit y may have recommendations and a chain of command in place for y ou to obtain PEP .After ev aluation of the exposure route and other risk factors, certain anti-HIV medications may be prescribed. The national bloodborne pathogen hotline pro vides 24-hour consultation for clinicians who ha ve been exposed on the job . Call 888 448-4911 for the latest information on proph ylaxis for HIV , hepatitis, and other pathogens. PEP is not as simple as sw allowing one pill. The medications must be started as soon as possible and continued for 28 da ys. Man y people experience significant medication side effects. It is v ery important to report occupational exposure to the department at y our workplace that is responsible for managing exposure. If post exposure treatment is recommended, it should be started as soon as possible. In rur al areas, police, firefighters, and other at -risk emergency pro viders should identif y a 24-hour source for PEP . Clinica l Management of HIV When their immune system is suppressed, people ha ve weak er defenses against the wide variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other pathogens that are present almost everywhere. The opportunistic diseases and infections associated with HIV infection comprise an y of the infections that are part of the AIDS-defining classification and the AIDS indicator conditions discussed earlier . The original case definition of HIV infection w as based on the clinical symptoms seen in men. In 1993 the CDC revised the classification system for HIV infection and expanded the case definition for AIDS to include in vasive cervical cancer , obviously a condition found only in women. Since 1993 scientists ha ve reported further differences in the w ay that HIV affects men, women, and children. Initial Evaluation Each HIV -infected patient initially entering into care should ha ve a complete medical history , physical examination, labor atory ev aluation, and counseling. The purpose is to confirm the presence of HIV infection, obtain appropriate baseline historical and labor atory data, ensure patient understanding about HIV infection and its tr ansmission, and initiate care. The initial ev aluation also should include introductory discussion on the benefits of antiretro viral ther apy (AR T) for the patient 's health and to prev ent HIV tr ansmission. Baseline information then is used to define management goals and plans (DHHS , 2013). The CD4+ T -cell count (or CD4 count) serv es as the major clinical indicator of immune function in patients who ha ve HIV infection. It is one of the k ey factors in determining the urgency of antiretro viral ther apy (AR T) initiation and the need for opportunistic infection proph ylaxis. it is also the strongest predictor of subsequent disease progression and surviv al according to clinical trials and cohort studies (DHHS , 2013). TreatmentBefore 1996 there were three medications a vailable to treat HIV . These drugs were used singly and were of limited benefit. R esearchers in 1996 disco vered that taking combinations of these and newer medications dr amatically reduced the amount of HIV (viral load) in the bloodstream of a person infected with HIV . Two or three different medications are used in combination. Each one targets a separ ate part of the virus and its replication. The reduction of deaths from AIDS in the United States has been primarily attributed to this combination ther apy, called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). HAAR T is made up of sev eral different kinds of medications: Nucleoside rev erse inhibitors (NNR TIs) Protease inhibitors Fusion inhibitors Integr ase inhibitors Entry inhibitors Combination drugs The addition of new drugs to combination ther apy has contributed to a decline in morbidit y and mortalit y in those infected with HIV and AIDS; it has also added to the cost of HAAR T. A Canadian study , which analyz ed healthcare costs in HIV -infected patients during 1995 to 2002, noted a substantial increase in healthcare expenditures per patient per month since the adv ent of HAAR T (Sendi and Gafni, 2003). Howev er, when other factors are tak en into consider ation\u2014such as increased productivit y due to a longer lifespan\u2014the increased cost of HAAR T appears to be offset b y other societal gains. In 2003 the lack of access to HIV/AIDS treatment w as declared a global health emergency and world leaders set a goal of univ ersal access to HAAR T by 2010. The W orld Health Organization (WHO) estimates that, globally , 2 million AIDS patients in dev eloping countries were receiving HAAR T in December of 2006, a more than fiv efold increase since 2001. Howev er, this number is only about 26% of the estimated 7.1 million people needing HAAR T. Even the lowest price\u2014US $142 per person per y ear for the first -line HAAR T regimen\u2014remains out of reach for man y patients in resource-limited settings. Because large-scale treatment began only recently in man y dev eloping countries, little is known about the long-term costs of drugs for AIDS treatment (Nunn et al. , 2007).As patients receiv e HAAR T for longer periods, AIDS case management has become more complex. Ov er time new antiretro virals ha ve emerged, offering ther apeutic impro vements with fewer pills. Although the prices of some new second-line antiretro virals (ARVs) ha ve also declined in some countries, second-line treatment is nearly alw ays more expensiv e than first -line treatment because of the high costs associated with dev eloping new technologies and the monopoly prices inno vator companies enjo y during patent terms. As treatment scales up globally , man y AIDS patients now receiving first -line ther apies will need ther apeutic alternativ es. The cost of second- and third-line AIDS treatment and access to the latest ARV ther apies is therefore a problem of global public health concern (Nunn et al. , 2007). Many studies ha ve demonstr ated that better outcomes are achiev ed in HIV -infected outpatients cared for b y a clinician with HIV expertise. Appropriate tr aining and experience, as well as ongoing continuing education, are important components for optimal care. Primary care pro viders without HIV experience, such as those who pro vide service in rur al or underserv ed areas, should identif y experts in the region who will pro vide consultation when needed (DHHS , 2013). HIV and Viral Hepatitis Co-Infection People infected with HIV are often at risk for vir al hepatitis; about one-third are co-infected with either HBV or HCV , which can cause long-term illness and death. More people living with HIV ha ve HCV than HBV . Viral hepatitis progresses faster and causes more liv er- related health problems among people with HIV than among those who do not ha ve HIV . Although drug ther apy has extended the life expectancy of people with HIV , liver disease\u2014 much of which is related to HCV and HBV \u2014has become the leading cause of non- AIDS- related deaths in this population (CDC, 2013d). To prev ent co-infection for those who are not already infected with HBV , the Advisory Committee on Immunization Pr actices recommends univ ersal HBV v accination of high-risk patients (including those who ha ve multiple sex partners; ga y, bisexual, and other men who ha ve sex with men [MSM]; injection drug users; and those who are exposed to blood at their jobs) with HIV infection or AIDS (CDC, 2013d). Co-infection with vir al hepatitis ma y also complicate the treatment and management of HIV infection. Because vir al hepatitis infection is often serious in people with HIV infection and ma y lead to liv er damage more quickly , CDC recommends that all people with HIV infection be tested for HBV and HCV . The CDC also recommends that ev eryone born during the period 1945-1965 should be tested at least once for HCV , no matter what their HCV risk (CDC, 2013d)HIV/HBV and HIV/HCV co-infections can be effectiv ely treated in man y people, but treatment is complex and people with co-infection should look for healthcare pro viders with expertise in the management of both HIV infection and vir al hepatitis (CDC, 2013d). Special Populations Vulnerable to HIV Although HIV infection affects people from all ethnic groups, genders, ages, and income levels, some groups ha ve been significantly affected b y the AIDS epidemic. These groups include men who ha ve sex with men, injecting drug users, people with hemophilia, infants and children, women, and people of color . Men Who Have Sex with Men American societ y has issues with homosexualit y. Grief ma y not be v alidated when relationships are viewed through prejudice and considered unacceptable. An example of this ma y be the reaction of churches to those who are living with, or ha ve families living with, AIDS . Man y congregants report that they do not get the support they need from their church families because of the stigma attached to HIV , AIDS , and homosexualit y. Self- esteem issues and psy chological issues including depression, anxiet y, diagnosed mental illness, and risk -taking beha viors ma y also complicate the liv es of these men. Injecting Drug Users People who continue to use injecting drugs, despite w arnings and information about risks, may be viewed b y some as \"deserving\" their infection. Harm reduction measures such as needle ex change progr ams ha ve been pro ven to reduce the tr ansmission of bloodborne pathogens such as HIV In addition, po verty, self-esteem issues, and psychological issues (including depression, anxiet y, diagnosed mental illness, and risk - taking beha viors) ma y also complicate the liv es of injection drug users. People with Hemophilia Many hemophiliacs were infected with HIV prior to the adv ent of blood testing. During the 1980s, 90% of sev ere hemophiliacs contr acted HIV or HCV through use of contaminated blood products. There is anger within this communit y because evidence shows that the companies manufacturing the concentr ates knew their products might be contaminated but continued to distribute them an yway.Some people considered hemophiliacs to be innocent victims of HIV , but there has been significant discrimination against them. The R yan White Care Act, funding HIV services, and the Ricky R ay Act, which pro vides compensation to hemophiliacs infected with HIV , were both named after HIV -positiv e hemophiliacs who suffered significant discrimination (arson, refusal of admittance to gr ade school) in their hometowns. Infants and Children At the end of 2010, Florida r anked second, behind New Y ork, in the number of cumulativ e pediatric AIDS cases reported (FDOH, 2010a). Ninet y-five percent of pediatric AIDS cases were acquired perinatally \u2014the remaining 5% were acquired through blood tr ansfusion, hemophilia, or another risk. Prev ention of perinatal HIV is a high priorit y in Florida and several initiativ es are focused on that goal. There has been significant progress in combating perinatally acquired AIDS\u2014its incidence has declined from a peak of 194 HIV - infected babies born in Florida in 1992 to 7 cases in 2012, although that is up from 3 cases in 2011 (FDOH, 2012). Children show significant differences in their HIV disease progression and their virologic and immunologic responses when compared to adults. Without drug treatment, children may have dev elopmental dela y, P. carinii pneumonia, failure to thriv e, recurrent bacterial infections, and other conditions related to HIV . The ARV treatments that are a vailable for HIV infection ma y not be a vailable in pediatric formulations. The medications ma y have different side effects in children than they do in adults. It is vital that women know their HIV status before and during pregnancy . Antiretro viral treatment significantly reduces the chance that their child will become infected with HIV . Prior to the dev elopment of antiretro viral ther apies, most HIV -infected children were v ery sick b y 7 years of age. In 1994 scientists disco vered that a short treatment course of the medication AZT for pregnant women dr amatically reduced the number , and r ate, of children who became infected perinatally . Cesarean sections for deliv ery ma y be w arranted in certain cases to reduce HIV tr ansmission. As a result, perinatal HIV infections ha ve substantially declined in the dev eloped world. Early diagnosis of HIV infection in newborns is now possible. Antiretro viral ther apy for infants is now the standard of care, and should be started as soon as the child is determined b y testing to be HIV -infected. Apparently uninfected children born to HIV - positiv e mothers are currently treated with antiretro viral medicines for 6 weeks to reduce any possibilit y of HIV tr ansmission. WomenWomen in the United States, and worldwide, are becoming infected with HIV at higher rates than an y other group of people. This is particularly true of women of color . Certain strains of HIV ma y infect women more easily . The str ain of HIV present in Thailand seems to transmit more easily to women through sexual intercourse. Scientists believ e that women and receptiv e partners are more easily infected with HIV than insertiv e partners. Receptiv e partners are at greater risk for tr ansmission of an y sexually tr ansmitted disease, including HIV . Women infected with HIV are at increased risk for a number of gynecologic problems, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), abscesses of the fallopian tubes and o varies, and recurrent y east infections. Some studies ha ve found that HIV -infected women ha ve a higher prev alence of infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Cervical dysplasia is a precancerous condition of the cervix caused b y certain str ains of HPV . Cervical dysplasia in HIV -infected women often becomes more aggressiv e as the woman' s immune system declines. This ma y lead to in vasive cervical carcinoma, which is an AIDS-indicator condition. It is important for women with HIV to ha ve more frequent P ap tests. Women ma y become infected with HIV from a partner who either used injecting drugs or had other sexual partners. Man y of these women assumed that the relationship w as monogamous, or that they \"knew\" their partner 's history . Man y others are unable to discuss or implement safer sex pr actices because they lack the skills or because domestic violence is present in their relationship . Women who are infected with HIV , or who ha ve family members who ha ve HIV , face some unique challenges. W omen ma y postpone taking medication, or going to medical appointments, in order to care for their children or other family members. Man y women have problems with lack of tr ansportation, lack of health insur ance, limited education, and low income. They ma y have childcare problems that prev ent them from going to medical appointments. Sev eral studies ha ve shown that women in the United States who ha ve HIV receiv e fewer healthcare services and HIV medications than men. This ma y be because women aren' t diagnosed or tested as frequently . Women (and also men) ma y fear disclosing their HIV status to others, fearing loss of their jobs, housing, or other forms of discrimination. Single parents with HIV ma y feel particularly fearful because of their lack of support. Many women who are infected with HIV do not consider this to be their worst problem. Their symptoms ma y be mild and manageable for man y years. Mean while, they ma y have more pressing concerns, such as their lack of income, housing, access to medical care, possible abusiv e relationships, and concerns about their children (WSDOH, 2007).People of Color African Americans and Hispanics ha ve disproportionately higher r ates of AIDS in the United States, despite the fact that there are no biologic reasons for the disparities. African American and Hispanic women mak e up less than 25% of the total U .S. population, but account for 77% of all reported AIDS cases in women. African Americans mak e up about 12% of the population, but account for 37% of all AIDS cases in the United States. Hispanics mak e up about 13% of the population, but account for 20% of the AIDS cases in the United States. In some areas, disparities also exist in the number of AIDS cases in Native Americans. There is no single reason that stands out as to wh y the disparities exist. One factor is health disparities, which are link ed to socioeconomic conditions. Another factor is distrust of the healthcare system. Both legacies of the past and current issues of r ace mean that many people of color do not trust \"the system\" for a v ariety of reasons. Thus, ev en when income is not a barrier , access to early interv ention and treatment ma y be limited. And HIV may be only one of a list of problems that also includes adequate housing, food, and emplo yment. Another factor ma y be the div ersities within these populations. Div ersity is evident in immigr ant status, religion, languages, and geogr aphic locations, as well as socioeconomic conditions. Pro viding targeted information to these div erse populations is challenging. A significant amount of denial about HIV risk continues to exist in these communities. As with other groups, there ma y also be fear and stigmatization of those who ha ve HIV . Prevention messages must be tailored and presented in a cultur ally and linguistically appropriate manner . The messages must be carried through channels that are appropriate for the individual communit y. These channels ma y include religious institutions or respected elders in the communit y. Ironically , it ma y be these institutions or elders who , in the past, ha ve contributed to the misinformation and stigma associated with HIV . Many HIV prev ention progr ams are recognizing the importance of working with div erse communities. Input from these communities must be included in planning, deliv ering, and evaluating HIV prev ention activities. HIV Prevention Many are seeking to address the HIV epidemic through prev ention progr ams. These efforts include national, international, and local progr ams. A bright spot on the horiz on is the possibilit y of a v accine.Potential Vaccine in the Pipeline As noted in the bulletin at the top of the course, there is growing confidence that in the future a v accine for HIV ma y be able to \"remo ve the HIV virus from the body .\" For a video issued in September 2013 b y Louis Pick er, associate director of the Oregon Health and Science Univ ersity's Vaccine and Gene Ther apy Institute, click here. National Strategy and High-Impact Prevention A conserv ative estimate for the period 1991 to 2006 finds that in the United States prevention has already a verted more than 350,000 HIV infections. The nation' s HIV prevention efforts are guided b y a single, ambitious str ategy for combating the epidemic: the National HIV/AIDS Str ategy (NHA S). Recent scientific breakthroughs and growing leadership and momentum among some of the hardest hit communities bode well for change (CDC, 2013e). Many challenges remain and b y CDC' s latest estimates, appro ximately 50,000 Americans become infected with HIV annually , and 16,000 people with AIDS died in 2008. As a result, the number of people living with HIV in the United States, now at nearly 1.2 million, continues to grow b y tens of thousands each y ear, creating more opportunities for HIV transmission. And a r ange of social, economic, and demogr aphic factors affect some Americans' risk for HIV , such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geogr aphic region (CDC, 2013e). To address the continuing challenges, CDC and its partners are pursuing a High- Impact Prevention approach to reducing new HIV infections. High- Impact Prev ention refers to use of combinations of scientifically pro ven, cost -effectiv e, and scalable interv entions targeted to the right populations in the right geogr aphic areas, and is intended to increase the impact of HIV prev ention efforts\u2014 an essential step in achieving the goals of NHA S (CDC, 2013e). This approach is designed to maximiz e the impact of prev ention efforts for all Americans at risk for HIV infection, including ga y and bisexual men, communities of color , women, injection drug users, tr ansgender women and men and y outh (CDC, 2013e). Syringe Exchange ProgramsSyringe exchange programs (SEPs) provide free sterile syringes in ex change for used syringes to reduce tr ansmission of bloodborne pathogens among injection-drug users. SEPs in the United States began as a w ay to prev ent the spread of HIV and other bloodborne infections such as HBV and HBC. The National Institute on Drug Abuse recommends that people who continue to inject drugs use a new , sterile syringe for each injection. As of November 2007, a total of 185 SEPs were oper ating in 36 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (CDC, 2007). A ban on the use of feder al money for these progr ams w as reinstated in 2012, and SEPs are banned in the state of Florida. Howev er, efforts were mounted in the state legislature 2013 to establish a fiv e-year pilot progr am to legaliz e SEPs (Adams, 2010; Burch, 2013; CDC, 2010/2012). Behavior Change and HIV Prevention In instances where national epidemics ha ve been rev ersed, a number of evidence-based studies ha ve shown that broad-based beha vioral changes were centr al to success. Hundreds of r andomiz ed controlled trials ha ve demonstr ated that individual, group , Group , 2008). Studies in low - and middle-income countries among y oung people, sex work ers, and other populations ha ve demonstr ated that prev ention progr ams ha ve to change sexual and drug-use beha viors in resource-limited settings to prev ent HIV tr ansmission. The prevention progr ams ha ve used the following approaches to prev ent HIV infection: Progr ams are targeted to individual beha vior. Emphasis is on broad-based efforts to alter social norms and address the underlying drivers of the epidemic. In addition, there is effectiv e use of a vailable tools such as: Treatment of sexually tr ansmitted infections Medical male circumcision Substitution ther apy for chemical dependence Progr ams that pro vide access to clean injecting equipmentUsing these and other interv aimed at beha vioral sev Australia, Uganda, Thailand, and Senegal, among others\u2014ha ve had dr amatic successes in curbing the spread of HIV within their borders. T ogether , these examples suggest that countries in a wide v ariety of settings ha ve contributed to changes in HIV risk beha viors and, in doing so , have saved countless liv es by averting HIV tr ansmission. Based on the totalit y of epidemiologic evidence, it appears that national implementation of evidence- informed combination HIV prev ention efforts in the 1990s w as associated with a 50% to 90% decline in HIV incidence and prev alence in k ey populations (W orking Group , 2008). Brazil In Brazil public health campaigns ha ve encour aged discussion of HIV , including fr ank public campaigns, condom promotion, focused vioral interv entions, needle ex change, school-based HIV education, prev ention services in prisons, and voluntary HIV counseling and testing. Br azil has been particularly successful in rev ersing a serious epidemic among injection drug users. Condom use increased b y almost 50% among sexually activ e adults between 1998 and 2005, and focused beha vior change prevention progr ams helped maintain HIV prev alence at low lev els among sex work ers. Although the W orld Bank had predicted in 1990 that 1.2 million Br azilians would be infected b y 2000, fewer than 600,000 were living with HIV in 2002 (W orking Group , 2008). Australia In Australia, public a wareness campaigns ha ve focused on beha vioral interv entions among gay men, syringe ex change progr ams, and v oluntary counseling and testing for HIV . As a result of A ustralia's early , comprehensiv e response, focused largely on beha vior change, annual HIV incidence peak ed in 1985 and declined through the end of the 1990s. Between 1990 and 2000, the annual number of new HIV diagnoses fell b y half (W orking Group , 2008). Uganda In what is perhaps the world' s best -documented national prev ention success, Uganda began in the mid-1980s to address the r apid spread of HIV . It implemented public - awareness campaigns that encour aged y oung people to dela y initiation of sex and urged sexually activ e adults to reduce the number of sex partners. In the 1990s, the country supplemented these early measures with condom promotion and in vestment in v oluntary counseling and testing. From the earliest y ears, communit y-gener ated progr ams pla yed a major role in the country' s AIDS response.The results of these efforts were remarkable. The percentage of y oung people who were sexually activ e fell b y more than half between 1989 and 1995, and Ugandans were significantly less lik ely to ha ve multiple sex partners than people living in neighboring countries. Increases in condom use in the 1990s helped preserv e and acceler ate early prevention gains. By the late 1990s, infection lev els in capital cit y Kampala had fallen b y two-thirds, and national HIV prev alence had been cut in half (W orking Group , 2008). Thailand In Thailand the annual incidence of HIV has declined from 143,000 in 1991 to 19,000 in 2003 through the country' s inno vative 100% condom progr am, which promoted the use of condoms in brothels. The go vernment also promoted public education about HIV and fair treatment of those infected with the virus. Had Thailand not brought comprehensiv e HIV prevention to scale, it would now ha ve 7.7 million HIV infections, r ather than the estimated 580,000 residents currently living with HIV (W orking Group , 2008). Senegal In Senegal, early in vestment in a wareness-r aising, condom promotion, intensiv e prevention services for populations at greatest risk, and engagement of communit y leaders and faith-based organizations, combined with high r ates of medical male circumcision, succeeded in k eeping national HIV prev alence below 1% when neighboring countries experienced significant increases in infections (W orking Group , 2008). Psychosocial Issues w ith HIV Infection Most states, including Florida, ha ve systems to link people with HIV infection and AIDS to care and support services. Case managers in the HIV/AIDS progr ams are the primary contact people for services. They can usually be found b y contacting the local health department or health district. HIV -infected or - affected people can be link ed with medical care, insur ance progr ams, v olunteer groups, hospice, and other t ypes of care and support services that ma y be needed during the course of a person, or family' s, time of living with HIV. Difficult Realities People with HIV and their families and friends face a multitude of difficult realities: Even with the adv ent of antiretro viral (ARV) drugs, people with AIDS still die prematurely . Men who ha ve sex with men and injecting drug users\u2014 who ma y already be stigmatiz ed and subjected to social and job-related discrimination\u2014ma y encountereven more societal pressure and stress with a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS . Ninet y percent of all adults with AIDS are in the prime of life and ma y not be prepared to deal with death and dying. The infections and malignancies that accompan y AIDS\u2014 along with certain medications\u2014can diminish and disfigure the body . People who are living with HIV face the need to pr actice \"safer sex\" and tak e medications for the remainder of their liv es. One thing that char acteriz es the grief around AIDS is the repetition of deaths among peers that one person ma y experience. Man y people working with or living with AIDS for y ears have gone to countless funer als and ha ve seen a succession of their friends pass a way. This is sometimes termed chronic grief . Chronic grief intensifies when an individual realiz es that before the grieving process for one death is complete man y more people ma y have died. The idea of cumulativ e multiple loss or grief satur ation is not new . The emotions felt b y long-term surviv ors of HIV and their HIV -negativ e friends and families are similar to the emotions of the surviv ors of the Holocaust, surviv ors of natur al disasters (earthquak es, tornados), and to the battle fatigue (PT SD) described b y soldiers. Psychological Suffering Infection with HIV causes distress for those who ha ve HIV and for their caregiv ers, family , lovers, and friends. Grief can manifest itself in ph ysical symptoms, including clinical depression, h ypochondria, anxiet y, insomnia, and the inabilit y to get pleasure from normal daily activities. Dealing with these issues ma y lead to self -destructiv e beha viors such as alcohol or drug abuse. Disbelief , numbness, and inabilit y to face facts occur for some. The fear of the unknown, the onset of infections, swollen lymph nodes, loss of weight (or unusual weight gain) can be accompanied b y fear of dev eloping AIDS , or of getting sick er. People infected with HIV/AIDS are often rejected b y family , friends, or co- workers. In some cases, guilt develops about the disease, about past beha viors, or about the possibilit y of ha ving unwittingly infected someone else. People living with HIV ma y feel as though their \"normal\" liv es ha ve completely ended as they plan detailed medication schedules and medical appointments. The cost of the medications for HIV ma y result in financial hardship , even if the person has medical coverage.Sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, withdr awal, and isolation are often present. Anger is common: at the virus, at the effects of the medications or the failure of some of the medications, at the prospect of illness or death, and at the discrimination that often encountered. Some people with HIV consider suicide or attempt suicide, and some ma y actually kill themselv es. Call the crisis hotline listed in y our phone book, or call the national suicide hotline at 800 784-2433 or 800 273-8255. Caregivers Often feelings experienced b y the caregiv er will mirror those of the patient, such as a sense of vulner ability and helplessness. Caregiv ers ma y experience the same isolation as the person with HIV infection. Finding a support system, including a qualified counselor , can be just as important for the caregiv er as for the person who has HIV disease. Support from co- workers can be especially important. Caregiv ers ma y find it necessary to acknowledge their own experiences and feelings when dealing with all aspects of this disease. Good self -care for the caregiv er is important and in volves addressing issues specific to caregiving. HIV and AIDS in Florida In 1988 Florida became one of the first states with high r ates of HIV infection to enact comprehensiv e legislation to address the AIDS epidemic. The Florida Omnibus AIDS Act stipulates that all licensed healthcare pro viders must tak e a course on HIV/AIDS and licensed healthcare facilities must educate their entire workforce on HIV infection. It also sets standards for testing, confidentialit y, informed consent, reporting requirements, and discrimination (FDOH, 2013). F or more information, click here. Testing, Informed Consent, and Confirmation The Florida Omnibus AIDS Act stipulates that HIV testing must be \"informed, v oluntary , and confidential\" and \"shall be preceded b y an explanation of the right to confidential treatment of information identif ying the subject of the test and the results of the test to the extent pro vided b y law\" (Florida Senate, 2010). Consent does not ha ve to be in writing but an explanation of the test and an indication that consent w as obtained must be recorded in the medical chart. In addition, the person tested must be informed that a positiv e test will be reported to the count y health department with sufficient information to identif y the test subject. \" All reasonable efforts\" must be made to inform the subject of a positiv e test result. In addition, healthcare pro viders are required to confirm positiv e test results through corrobor ating tests before informing the test subject of the result (FDOH, 2013).There are some ex ceptions in Florida la w to the requirement to obtain informed consent prior to conducting a test for HIV (Florida Senate, 2013): When testing for sexually tr ansmissible diseases is required b y state or feder al law, or by rule including the following situations: When a person is con victed of prostitution or procuring another to commit prostitution When an inmate is released from prison When deemed necessary b y a medical examiner When a woman is pregnant (see Pregnancy below) Exceptions pro vided for blood, plasma, organs, skin, semen, or other human tissue During bona fide medical emergencies when needed to pro vide appropriate care When obtaining informed consent would be detrimental to the patient When performed as part of an autopsy for which consent w as obtained When done at a victim' s request in a prosecution for an y type of sexual battery where a blood sample is tak en from the defendant v oluntarily When mandated b y a court order For epidemiologic research When human tissue is collected la wfully without the consent of the donor for corneal removal or enucleation of the ey es When a healthcare work er has had significant exposure to a patient 's blood, and a blood sample is already a vailable that w as giv en voluntarily for other purposes When a hospitaliz ed infant is determined to be abandoned When done on a person already determined to be HIV positiv e and for repeat testing The Florida Omnibus AIDS Act also directs the Florida Department of Health to conduct epidemiologic studies and pro vide testing and patient care services throughout the state. In 2010 there were 405,757 HIV tests performed in Florida b y count y public health departments, with 1.1% of the tests being positiv e (FDOH, 2010a). ConfidentialityIn Florida, all patient medical records are confidential, but to encour age v oluntary testing the Omnibus AIDS Act mak es HIV test results superconfidential. The superconfidentialit y applies only to the results of labor atory reports and does not extend to clinical observ ations regarding symptoms associated with AIDS . Breach of confidentialit y of sexually tr ansmitted disease information is a third-degree felon y. Pregnancy Florida la w requires that during pregnancy ev ery person\u2014including ph ysicians and midwiv es\u2014attending a pregnant woman for conditions relating to pregnancy during the period of gestation and deliv ery must offer the woman tests for sexually tr ansmissible diseases, including HIV . In 2005 the la w was amended to mandate \"opt -out\" testing for pregnant women. Pregnant women are advised that they will be tested for HIV but they have the right to refuse. An y refusal must be obtained in writing and placed in the woman' s medical record (FDOH, 2013). Minors Minors under the age of 18 do not need parental consent for HIV and STD testing. Florida law specifically forbids informing the parents of the minor 's HIV test, results, or treatment, even indirectly (FDOH, 2013). Discrimination The Florida Omnibus AIDS Act prohibits discrimination against those who are HIV -positiv e in emplo yment, housing, public services, health and life insur ance, and public accommodations. Notifiable Disease HIV and AIDS are notifiable diseases in Florida. In 1996 Florida began requiring ph ysicians and labor atories to report HIV -positiv e test results to local health authorities with patient identifiers. F ailure to do so can result in a $500 fine and disciplinary action b y their licensing board. Under Department of Health (DOH) rules, pr actitioners must report HIV - positiv e diagnoses of all people to their local count y health department within 2 weeks, and infants born to HIV -positiv e women must be reported the next da y. In 2006 the DOH expanded its reporting requirements to include CD4 and vir al load data (FDOH, 2013). Conclusio nThere ha ve been man y well-documented and successful str ategies emplo yed in the United States and throughout the world to curb the dev astating expansion of the AIDS epidemic. Nevertheless, the cost in liv es and lost productivit y remains a staggering problem. In the United States there were 42,011 new HIV infections reported in 2009 and worldwide there are about 2.5 million new infections annually . HIV/AIDS affects people of all ages and ethnic backgrounds in Florida and is the third leading cause of death among women between the ages of 25 and 44, although it is the sixth leading cause of death in men in that age group . In 2010 it w as the fourth leading cause of death among black men and second among black women. As healthcare work ers, we ha ve the abilit y to encour age pr actices that are known to reduce the spread of AIDS including beha vioral change, prompt treatment of sexually tr ansmitted disease, encour aging use of clean injection drug equipment, routine HIV testing, patient education and counseling, and consistent condom use. The goal is to eliminate new HIV infections entirely in Florida and throughout the United States and the world. W e all pla y a vital role in accomplishing this goal.
