Thank you so much for your 5-star review and especially the love!! We truly appreciate your continued support and we look forward to seeing you again soon!! The workers despite it being Saturday night were fun and personable (and helpful). The food is always good - and it was nice sitting outside with a friend! Thank you so much for your 5-star review Pemcorgi! We're so glad you enjoyed your dining experience with us and we truly appreciate your continued support! Come visit us again soon! I like healthy food...but this stuff is not for me. I had a tasteless broth with some greens in it. It was like eating hay with warm water. Thank god there was a burger place next door! They removed the steamer which was very important with the broth style meals. They are very inconsistent with how your meal is prepared, and the last time i ate there the bread was stale, the steak was over cooked. This place used to serve a...consistent great meal. I like healthy style food. I also have a problem cooking raw chicken near the cooked steak. They appeared to keep things separate, but it leaves the opportunity for error. This review is a combination of my last 4 visits. I will once again give it a break.More I have dined at Core Life in Henrietta, as well as other locations since it opened. It was my go to dining place for lunch. This has drastically changed. #1) They no longer steam the vegis, they just pour hot juice over them. If you...ask, they say the steamer is not turned on in the back. #2) constant training of new help gives you sometimes an inferior bowl more than not! #3) The guy that cooks the chicken should wear a beard cover. I dont like beard hairs in my food. #4) They cook the chicken next to the steak. They are usually behind and the raw chichen is inches from the cooked meats. They are violating numerous health laws, as I have a Manager food service license. The help is plesant but unorganized. I am happy i have not gotten sick from the way they are running this place. It is evident as there is no long line there anymore. What a shame. I will give it a rest for a few months and try again, if it doesnt go under. I really liked this place at one time.More My wife and I are transitioning to a Whole Food Plant Based Diet after attending some seminars held by local health gurus from both Traditional Medicine and Homeopathic Health. We were really not expecting that we would be able to find delicious food at a...restaurant like CoreLife after having been conditioned to indulge in the Standard American Diet for most of our lives. Wow their healthy meal bowls, sides and entrees are so healthy and good for you without giving up the flavor and delicious satisfaction that comes with a good lunch or dinner. Don't take our word for it, go and try the wide variety of vegetarian, vegan and superfood options available on their menu. Their salads with hummus, falafel and sesame tahini dressing are wonderful.More We had finished a weekend of helping our RIT daughter move back into her apartment and stopped here for lunch before catching our flight home. It is very convenient in a center right off the south side of Jefferson, with plenty of parking all around....There were several open tables inside, but it was nice out so we sat at an outside table out front. Pictures of the outside sign, the ordering line area, and the extensive lemonade/ tea self serve areas are attached. Since it was a Monday, it looked like a lot of working pople come here for lunch or take it to go. The program is you figure out what combination of components you want in your bowl, or pick a pre designated combination, then walk along the counter and watch them make it. For the three of us we had: - A poke Fire bowl, with tuna chunks on top, that my daughter seemed to like (picture attached); - A tuna poke bowl also with many tuna chunks on top, that my wife seemed to like (picture attached); - I had the SrirachaTofu with Quinoa bowl and a cup of Chicken curry soup, that I liked very much (picture attached); We all had mixture of interesting lemonade / teas from the self serve lemonade area (picture attached). I liked mixing the beet lemonade with the honey lemonade. Overall a nice casual convenient spot.More Stopped by with my daughter for a quick lunch after an RIT visit. My daughter is a vegetarian so it is often hard to find good options beyond plain pizza and Mac-n-cheese. CoreLife fit the bill - lots of healthy options that don't break the...bank. Watch out - the bimimbop is super spicy, but goood.More Im not the one that is familiar with \"clean eating\" but my sister in law brought me here for brunch and I was NOT disappointed! The portions are huge and wont make you feel guilty for indulging all of it! I had the BBQ Ranch...Chicken bowl. The assembly line to put it together reminds me of Moe's but HEALTHY! I now LOVE this over any fast food place. Chicken, steak, Ahi Tuna.. you name it! Just plain YUM!More My 1st year RIT daughter and I only had a short window betweel RIT Brick City Homecoming / Family weekend activities to grab lunch, and she likes this place. For the vegan / vegetarians among you , this place would fit right in. I had...a Shitake Mushroom & Tofu \"soup\" bowl, that also had a bunch of veggies in it, not sure what all though. But it was good. My daughter had a Tuna Poke FIre bowl, with good looking pieces of tuna in it. We both had lemonade, mine was mixed with beet juice - interesting and OK. To get your order you walk through a buffet type line, tell them what you want, watch them grab all the ingredents, and mix it together. Then pay and go find a table. This place was perfect for what we needed and the time we had last Saturday.More We were on a road trip, staying in the area for the night and were looking for a healthy option for a quick, casual dinner. This was perfect! We each had one of the warm rice bowls. The food was fresh and tastey. Had spicy tai chicken rice noodle salad, Mediterranean salad, Southwest grilled chicken and purple rice salads and one order coconut curry chicken noodle soup. The total came to 41$ for 3 a bit pricey for a late lunch. Salads were fine but the chicken soup...had no curry or coconut milk in it and when we complained they said \"well that's the way we make it here and both ingredients are in there\" (trust me they weren't). Surprised at their push back to my sister in law. Oh well. Guess they don't want the businessMore Stopped in for lunch with my daughter and 2 granddaughters. e were at the height of the lunch hour and the line was almost to the door. Surprisingly the line moved quickly and we were sered in a short time. The girls liked the kids...menu, I had Siracha tofu with quinoa. Everything was fresh and tasty, definitely coming back.More I stopped in because I wanted vegetables. I had a salad of romaine and kale, with tomatoes, cukes, pickled peppers and feta cheese, plus humus and 2 falafel! Dressing was the recommended one. It was delicious. If I lived here, I would go back. I had heard about Core Life Eatery but had not been there until this week. We arrived about 11:45 am and a steady line of customers came in, some for take-out, others to eat in. Core Life offers noodle /grain bowls, broth bowls in a...wide variety of meat and/or veggie toppings. Everything was very fresh, assembled quickly, and was well-seasoned. Clearly, they have done their research on the items they offer. I especially recommend the Thai Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl and the Cucumber "}
