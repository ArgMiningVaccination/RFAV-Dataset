But that's really just part of a larger question: Do we have a shared philosophy, and what is it? Whether we think of it that way, na- tions ask themselves this question rou- tinely. Should our nation be guided by a religious philosophy, or not? Should we elect our leader as a group, or should a person ascend to leadership through inheritance? If the times require us to alter our viewpoint, do we decide as a group, or does someone decide for us, and if so, who? Sometimes the answer is explosive: Whoever we are, it's not working, and we need to change now. That's the kind of answer that can lead to revolutions. In the US, we've mostly dealt with the question of our national ethic more quietly, starting with the first national conversation, which lay out a basic philosophy in the form of a constitution. Nevertheless, there have been many difficult conver- sations we've failed to have as a nation. To whom do we accord full citizenship, for example? Not even the Founding Fa- thers could agree on this one, thereby establishing the alternative to a national conversation: the local conversation. Instead of making a national decision about which people could own land, vote, or intermarry, those questions were left to local governments. In these cases, challenging and sometimes overturning local philoso- phies (and sometimes overturning them again) has been, not through legislation, but through the courts, through litigation. That's how we've handled teaching evolution in schools, gay marriage, and abortion\u2014locally and through litigation. Some conversations, it seems, are just too difficult to have nationwide. I expected the conversation about stem- cell therapies to be one of those too- difficult conversations as well, one that would also be handled case by case and concession by concession\u2014through litigation rather than legislation. So it came as a surprise to learn that in mid-May, US Representatives Brian Bilbray (R-CA) and Diana DeGett (D-CO) introduced the Regenerative Medicine Act of 2011 (H.R. 1862). The Act notes that, \"Regenerative medi- cine products have already successfully treated numerous health conditions, and have the potential to provide cures, treatments, and diagnostics for a range of diseases and disabilities including di- abetes, spinal cord injury, heart disease, stroke, and various forms of cancer.\" The proposed legislation goes on to say, \"A United States national strategy on regenerative medicine is critical to ensure that this technology fulfills its potential to cure and treat diseases and disabilities, reduce overall health spending, and promote economic growth.\" Not once does the Act mention stem cells, embryonic or otherwise, which are among the therapeutic agents used in regenerative medicine. It is the po- tential use of embryonic stem cells that makes a national conversation diffi- cult, because, like the still-unresolved abortion debate, it pits technology against notions of personhood. In- deed, the stem-cell debate has already been the object of some well-publicized litigation. And it seemed likely that the entire debate would continue that way. Whatever the fate of the Regenera- tive Medicine Act of 2011, I hope it sets a precedent for the way we discuss novel, but potentially ethically thorny issues of technology in the future. After living together as a nation for 235 years, shouldn't we at least know how to broach difficult conversations? PT Read more on the topic of regen- erative medicine on page 134.Legislation v.

When it comes to busi- ness strategy, it also includes social and corporate governance, according to a definition from consulting firm Brand- logic and investment analytics firm CRD Analytics. The companies recently released a survey about the real and perceived sustainability efforts of the top 100 com- panies around the world. The goal of the Sustainability Leadership Report: Measur- ing Perception vs. Reality is for industry to use the identified gaps between real and perceived sustainability efforts to improve corporate performance. The good news is that the pharmaceutical/ healthcare industry, one of nine sectors included in the survey, is leading the way in corporate sustainability. Other sectors included consumer, energy, financials, industrials and transportation, informa- tion technology, materials and mining, and telecommunications and Internet. The study authors used data from survey participants to establish a sustainability IQ matrix which groups companies into one of four areas: laggards (low perception, low reality), promoters (high perception, low reality), challengers (low perception, high reality), and leaders (high perception, high reality). Groups are based on real and perceived scores, both of which incorpo- rate key performance indicators such as the company's environmental emissions, social diversity, and corporate vision. Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Novo Nordisk, and Pfizer all ranked in the \"leader\" cat- egory. Roche fell into the \"challenger\" category; BASF fell into the \"promoter\" category; and no one from pharma ended up in the \"laggard\" field. The industry's activities in environmen- tal, social, and corporate governance come as no surprise. The most nascent goal of the drug-manufacturing world is to improve health, and ultimately, to improve lives. More and more, industry is realizing that social, environmental, and governance sustainability initiatives\u2014and not just its products\u2014can help it achieve this goal.

They worked perfectly. But the manufacturing setup mechanics must have set up the la- beling equipment incorrectly. There was so much breakage. It is an expensive product, and the breakage meant lost income and delays. The investigation started with a call to our European colleagues who use the same syringe. In fact, the validation quantities had come from their stocks. We were unaware that new syringes had been manufactured by a North American fac- tory, rather than by the European syringe factory,\" moaned our Agent. \"The North American syringes were actually banana- shaped, with a bit of a curve. When they were rolled along the labeling machine, pressure caused the breakage. Our vali- dation had used the 'best-case scenario' syringes.\" Objective inspection \"At the end of the year, we filled out our self-evaluation forms based on year-long objectives,\" our GMP Agent-In-Place sighed. \"Among other things, I was re- sponsible for hosting inspections, but that duty never shows up on the objectives list because it is essentially a job-description requirement. I was upset because I could only demonstrate that 20% of my objec- tives had been reached. When I added up the inspection days I spent with FDA, the US Drug Enforcement Agency, the US Bu- reau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (we used 1 million gallons of denatured alcohol per year, and they want accounting for it), the US Department of Agriculture, and health authorities from Germany and the United Kingdom, however, I realized that I had been involved in 202 inspection days.\" On the bubble \"One thing I like to check when auditing is whether the balances or scales are level,\" began our GMP Agent-In-Place. \"Most of them have a bubble indicator, and the bubble should appear inside the circle for proper operation. You'd be surprised how often I find the scales off level. After mov- ing a scale, good practice involves perform- ing at least a two-point check with certified weights on the scales and balances. A best practice is a full recalibration.\" Helping out \"Sometimes we get involved in activities outside our department, even if it is just answering a question,\" our GMP Agent- In-Place explained. \"We had a new em- ployee who was responsible for the safety program. A woman from the research and development division hurt her back while lifting a product container. We use metric measurement for everything, and the safety manager was used to American- standard measures. He didn't realize how much 60 L of product would weigh when we told the woman she could move it\u2014it actually weighed about 140 pounds (given the density of the material). The container was a large bulky item for anyone to be lift- ing and repositioning.\" Budgeted compliance \"Site projects were often prioritized by the site manager,\" noted our GMP Agent-In- Place. \"The goal was to move projects for- ward based upon compliance and quality at each site, so after a year of politicking, we had a $200,000 budget for use in un- planned quality projects at the discretion of the worldwide vice-president for qual- ity. One site head read the budget in full, and as soon as the new budget year began, he requested funding from our stash. He wanted to paint hallways and the guard- house, claiming that the result would be improved morale which would ultimately improve quality. The request was rejected.\" Substandard substrate \"Ouch,\" winced our GMP Agent-In-Place. \"Our contract manufacturer owns the product license and decided that we had to recall several batches of product. The product was sold based on the potency in the vial; more potency means higher prices. The potency is labeled on the vial and dif- fers from batch to batch. On the recalled batches, the potency was too high. When we asked why the labeled potency was so high, the manufacturer explained that they had changed the assay substrate, and it was resulting in a higher potency than desired. Simply put, we had failed to properly vali- date the method change.\" PTGetting an answer is easy\u2014asking the right question is apparently more difficult.All the Wrong Questions Pharmaceutical Technology's month- ly \"Agent-in-Place\" column distills true-life cautionary tales from the files of Control, a senior compli- ance officer.

The EU legislative body, which consists of the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, represents the governments of the union's 27 mem- ber states. The legislature has decided to delegate the task of fin- ishing the job to the European Commission, the EU's executive body. After that task is complete, any additional details will still have to be approved by the two legislative arms before finalization and implementation can occur. \"We're pleased with what we have got but we've got reserva- tions about the details because there are a lot of unanswered ques- tions about how the legislation will be implemented,\" says Tony Scott, adviser to the European Fine Chemicals Group (EFCG), which represents European-based API producers. During the next 18 months and before the FMD's implemen- tation, EU states will have to incorporate the directive into their national statutes. Some experts believe that the Commission could take much longer than this allotted timeframe to fill in the gaps, particularly with regard to the new rules regarding APIs and packaging. Most APIs used in Europe are imported, mainly from India and China. The European fine-chemical manufacturers failed to persuade the legislators to agree to a mandatory system of of- ficial inspections to ensure that API plants comply with GMPs. European API producers have long complained about unfair competition from substandard Asian imports. Instead, the legislation makes auditing of API plants by drug manufacturers obligatory. It also requires countries exporting APIs into Europe to have plant-inspection systems and GMP standards equivalent to those in the EU. The Commission will have to decide what is \"equivalent\" and establish a process for verification of equivalence. The legislation appears to be flexible on this matter. It does not lay down, for example, that GMP standards for active ingredients will be the same as those in existing EU regulations. \"The Commission will certainly need to consider a transition period for implementation of this provision (on equivalence in standards of API exporting countries),\" says Julie Marechal-Jamil, senior manager for quality and regulatory affairs at the European Generic Medicines Association (EGA). FMD also makes GMP for excipients obligatory. But it has left to the Commission the decision about what GMP standards must be applied. Excipient producers seem confident that the existing GMPs for food production will be permitted. With regard to packaging, the legislation stipulates that pack- aging should enable verification of authenticity, identification of individual packs, and capacity to show tampering evidence. These features would be backed by a pan-European information- technology network that is linked to a central database. The exact nature of the safety features and the verification system, including any data-matrix characteristics and the size of the centralized databank, still needs to be finalized. The details are likely to be a controversial because they could trigger costly changes in packaging processes and equipment. Already, the generic-drug sector is demanding exemptions from the scheme on the grounds that generic drugs are the least likely to be counterfeited and that producers of high-priced drugs should bear most of the costs of the changes. \"Manufacturers that have medicines considered at high risk of being falsified should pay (for the costs of the system) by the value of the medicine and not by the volume in the market,\" says Hugo Carradinha, EGA's senior manager for health economics affairs. Tighter supply-chain controls for finished medicines as well as for raw materials will offer new openings to chemical distributors, particularly those adhering to good distribution practice, which is also a requirement of the new legislation. \"This legislation is a positive development for us,\" says Mi- chael Cooke, who is responsible for the pharmaceutical sector at Univar, a leading chemicals distributor in Europe. \"Trace- ability will become of even greater importance with pharma customers needing to be assured that suitable GMP standards are applied to all materials. We've invested in creating robust traceability systems.\" Drug manufacturers will be seeking help from suppliers and distributors to reduce the extra costs of the legislation. \"Fund- ing of the FMD is a key concern,\" says Marechal-Jamil. Already, the enforcement of the new regulations faces delays because of a limited budget. Scarcity of funds could be major factor holding up the implementation of FMD as well.

Restek Cat.# GNOT139522 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 PharmTech.comIN THE FIELD Global Healthcare on the Ground GSK Works in Developing Nations to Improve Everything from Research to Roads Angie Drakulich GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has been leading several industry efforts during the past decade to improve healthcare among developing-country popula- tions. In 2001, the company dedicated a research and development (R&D) facility in Tres Cantos, Spain, to de- veloping new treatments to combat diseases in the developing world. GSK now operates an open laboratory at the facility, which offers researchers from around the world a place to collabo- rate on new medicines for neglected diseases. Pricing and partnerships GSK also offers preferential pricing as well as not-for-profit pricing of its antiretrovirals (ARVs) to developing nations which helps to improve access to the needed drugs. The program reaches 69 of the world's poorest coun- tries. In addition, approximately 75% of the company's manufactured vac- cines are sold to developing countries on a tiered-pricing plan. GSK has established community in- vestment activities and partnerships that foster healthcare practices in places such as sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and South America, and has launched several part- nerships aimed at finding solutions for global healthcare problems. \"Developing countries face mul- tiple issues on a systemic basis that negatively affect health outcomes for their citizens,\" says Jon Pender, vice- president for intellectual property and access at GSK, about the company's global healthcare efforts. \"Fundamen- tally, poverty both makes people sicker and makes it harder to tackle health-care challenges. Many people living in poverty do not have enough food or clean water. In this context, a health- care system may exist only in name or only in isolated pockets within a coun- try. For example, Africa suffers 24% of the global disease burden yet has only 3% of the world's health workers and 1% of the world's health budget with which to tackle it. There is no way you can get those numbers to add up to ad- equate healthcare provision. Together, the public and private sectors and civil society have helped to galvanize more resources for global health and reduce the barriers to access to medicines. GSK sees itself as a part of this move- ment and is specifically addressing is- sues where our talents and resources can be deployed to maximum benefit.\" A major challenge with regard to de- veloping and delivering needed medi- cines to developing countries and ne- glected populations has to do with the long-standing reality of the economics behind R&D, adds Pender. He points out that developing a new medicine or vaccine typically takes 10 to 12 years and costs around $1 billion, including the costs of failures. Traditionally, the lack of a viable commercial return on this investment for diseases that are not prevalent in industrialized mar- kets meant that little research was conducted on these diseases. Today, however, more attention is being paid to previously neglected diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB) and malaria, and new approaches that share the risks and costs of R&D are being pursued, he says. Through product-develop- ment partnerships with organizations, such as the PATH Malaria Vaccine Ini- tiative (MVI) and the TB Alliance, the pharmaceutical industry is developing new tools to combat theses diseases. The past two years have been particu- larly important for GSK in this regard. In addition to establishing the open re- search laboratory in Spain, in 2010, GSK made available to the public more than 13,000 potential malaria targets to help scientists globally focus on finding a malaria treatment. The company is also working with PATH-MVI and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a vaccine against malaria. The vaccine is in Phase III clinical trials at 11 sites across seven countries in Africa. The company also established an R&D unit focused on developing late-stage products and formulations for diseases that affect populations in the emerging markets. Other pharma companies are involved, including Amgen, which is working with GSK to make its osteopo- rosis medicine, denosumab, available in developing countries. Gilead is partner- ing with GSK to make its drug for hepati- tis B, tenofivir, available in China. India's Dr. Reddy's and GSK worked together to move two new cardiovascular branded generic drugs for developing-country populations into development. The R&D unit, meanwhile, has four ongoing late- stage projects in respiratory disease, urol- ogy, dermatology, and cardiovascular disease. These projects involve working with regions and countries to understand fully the local needs and to tailor clinical trials to those needs. Access The registration of new medicines in many of these targeted countries, how- ever, can be costly, complex, and time- consuming, says Pender. \"Too often, reg- ulatory authorities do not have sufficient capacity to deal effectively with numer- ous and complex product registrations. A possible solution would be the creation of a harmonized registration system that several countries with the same disease priorities can adhere to.\" contin. on page 24API Delivery Enhancement Super Refined\u00ae Excipients Croda's Super Rening process removes polar impurities from excipients without altering their fundamental structure in any way.

One of the unit's goals is to increase patient access to key medicines and vaccines. The recently created Advance Mar- ket Commitment (AMC), pioneered by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), offers another financing mechanism to ensure more sustainability in vaccine manufactur- ing and supply for the developing world. Recently, GSK agreed to supply up to 300 million doses of its pneumococcal vac- cine for a period of 10 years to countries that are part of GAVI as part of the first global AMC for the pharmaceutical in- dustry. Pfizer has made a similar com- mitment for its vaccine. Infrastructure Another challenge faced by the health- care industry globally is the infrastruc- ture that exists in many developing countries, including poor distribution networks and a lack hospitals, clinics, and healthcare professionals. Political issues often compound these barriers, meaning that even when there is fund- ing, there is little action, says Pender. \"In middle-income countries, the health sys- tem may be more developed, but wide ranges in income mean that many poor people at the lower rungs of the income ladder are not able to access healthcare,\" he adds. The needs to strengthen health systems and reduce inequities are be- coming more visible, and much more can be done to increase access to life- saving services, says Pender. In the least developed countries (LDCs), the challenge of improving healthcare and access to medicines is even more difficult. Earlier this year, therefore, GSK formed a partnership with AMREF, CARE International UK, and Save the Children to help reinvest 20% of the company's profits made in LDCs back into projects that strengthen the healthcare infrastructure in those countries. The money will go toward programs that improve health outcomes by supporting frontline health workers who operate in these countries. Since 2009, GSK also has committed to significantly reducing its prices for patented medicines in the LDCs. The company's goal is to reduce prices to no more than 25% of their price in the United Kingdom. Future plans Going forward, GSK plans to continue and add to these global healthcare ef- forts. \"All these initiatives commit us to continuing to work closely with the global community and to ensuring the necessary resources and political will are in place to make partnerships work,\" says Pender. \"Partnerships that combine the resources and expertise of companies, governments, international agencies, aca- demic institutions, NGOs and communi- ties, are a central component to our global health approach. From GSK's perspective as a global company, we believe this is not only the right thing to do but makes good business sense. By working with others to find logical and sustainable solutions for the long-term, we can achieve more for patients than we can alone,\" he adds.Zone in on: Regulation FDA Reviews First Year of Bad Ad Program Erik Greb After looking back at the first year of its Bad Ad outreach program, FDA judged that the initiative has successfully raised awareness about misleading promotion, according to an FDA press release. The program, which was intended to educate healthcare providers about misleading drug promo- tions, debuted on May 11, 2010. Since that time, the agency has received 328 reports of potentially untruthful promotion. In contrast, FDA received an average of 104 reports per year before the initiative was launched. Healthcare professionals submitted 188 of the 328 reports, and 87 of them were identified for comprehensive review. The latter number demonstrates that the medical community has a rela- tively strong level of knowledge about what constitutes misleading promotion, according to the press release. The agency hopes that doctors' heightened sense of awareness about misleading promotion will deter drug promoters who might otherwise violate regulations. Consumers submitted 116 reports to the program, and 24 of them were received a comprehen- sive review. In addition, representatives of regulated industry submitted 24 reports, 14 of which were flagged for a comprehensive review. FDA considers the number and diversity of reports sub- mitted to be indications of the program's success, according to the press release. FDA Commissioner Hamburg started the Bad Ad Program last year by sending a letter to more than 33,000 physicians. In her letter, Hamburg described FDA's efforts to \"collaborate with health- care professionals to address misleading promotion, wherever it occurs. \" The Division of Drug Marketing Advertising and Communications (DDMAC) in the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research later created a video and brochure to provide examples of untruth- ful or misleading promotion. Ads that omit information about a product's risk, promote unap- proved product uses, or overstate a product's effectiveness can be considered bad ads, according to DDMAC literature. During the past year, representatives of DDMAC set up exhibits at 15 medical conferences and spoke to doctors about the program. DDMAC also conducted presentations at two US teaching hospitals. FDA has issued several Warning Letters as a result of the program. The first one was sent in December 2010 to Hill Dermaceuticals about a website promoting the company's Derma- Smoothe/FS (fluocinolone acetonide) for use on infants. FDA will expand the Bad Ad program by developing a web-based continuing-education pro- gram. To continue its outreach to healthcare professionals, FDA will focus additional efforts on stu- dents and doctors in the beginning of their practices. FDA also plans to collaborate with medical, pharmacy, and nursing schools to enhance student education. In addition, DDMAC representatives will continue to attend medical trade shows across the country.Developing new paths to broaden your formulation horizons WE PROVIDE EXCIPIENT SOLUTIONS FOR YOUR DRUG DELIVERY APPLICATIONS.

The unit provides automated vibration and includes an electronically controlled vibra- tion sensor to ensure results' repeatability. The PT-X instrument's feeder was specially designed to maintain reliable sample feeding. By reducing the amount of operator intervention required, the device helps en- sure analytical accuracy and repeatability. Analysis is performed quickly through the machine's user-friendly software, which has multilanguage functionality. Users can per- form measurements by recording each test sieve's serial number. Press produces various tablet formats The FE55 tablet press from Fette Compacting can be configured for traditional monolayer use, monolayer use for direct com- pression, and double-layer use. When configured for double- layer tablets, the device uses its optional third compression sta- tion as a tamping station for the first tablet layer. The machine's design enables it to produce approximately 90% of the most common tablet formats, accord- ing to the company. When configured for bilayer manufacturing, the device's pneumatically-actuated lower roll assembly instantaneously raises the first lower compression roll by as much as 2 mm. This action temporarily increases the hardness of the first tablet layer so that it can withstand the trip through the sampling chute and be weighed. The press reverts to normal operation without requir- ing operator input. In addition, the machine's feeder assembly uses a single paddle with an inverted-cone shape to enable unrestricted product flow.FE55 tablet Micron Powder Systems www.hmicronpowder.comPharmaceutical companies have ample experience making tablets, which remain the most common dosage form. But despite the industry's accumulated knowledge, prob- lems in the tablet-production process, such as capping and lamination, sometimes occur. Firms can try to avoid these problems with improved tableters and with instruments that help them understand their ingredients' properties. This month's products are intended to aid the manufacture of tablets. A new tablet press from Fette can produce multilayer tablets. Elizabeth-Hata's new machine enables the precise alignment of cores in core tablets. An instrument from Hosokowa provides accurate information about power char- acteristics, such as flowability. Tablet press enables precision core placement The new version of the Hata CVX Core Press machine from Elizabeth-Hata enables precision core alignment in core- tableting applications. The CVX series is appropriate for multilayer and custom core-tableting. The press has man- ual washdown capability to facilitate product changeover. The new unit allows users to insert an item into a pre- determined location in a specific die. The geometry of the transfer cog maintains the item's placement within the die, and the position cannot be changed once it has been set. The device holds cores in position and slowly embeds them into the tablet over 32 /uni2218 of rotation, thus enabling consistent, accurate, and repeatable placement. In addition, the press includes technol- ogy for core-coating and time-release solid dosage tablets. The Hata CVX press includes a portable control kiosk that helps save space. The touch-screen control provides a Windows-based software interface that includes context-sensitive help text to simplify press operation.

There are a host of thorny issues t o resolve related to reference products , interchangeability, labeling, and ex - clusivity. One area of agreement is tha t producing biosimilars is vastly mor e complex and costly than manufactur - ing conventional generic drugs, an d that FDA will require broader testin g to license a product as biosimilar o r interchangeable. Developing a follow-o n biotech therapy will require consider - able investment in time, resources, an d expertise, running up a tab of som e $75-$250 million and typically takin g seven to eight years, according to Amee t Mallik, global head of Novartis's Sando z biopharmaceutical division, during a n investor call in May 2011 . Even so, the prospect of biopharma - ceuticals capturing a greater share of th e global drug market is drawing interes t from many pharmaceutical and biotec h companies. The worldwide market fo r biosimilars is projected to grow to $3. 7 billion by 2015, up from about $250 mil - lion last year, according to Datamonitor . As more biotechnology product patent s expire and regulatory authorities clarif y requirements, biosimilar development i s projected to soar. Leading pharmaceutica l companies, such as Novartis and Merck , aim to be major players in the field, an d even innovator biotech companies lik e Amgen are eyeing the follow-on market . Setting a pathway FDA officials are under pressur e from Congress, government agencies , and payers to develop an abbreviate d regulatory pathway for approving bi - osimilars, as authorized by the Biolog - ics Price Competition and Innovatio n Act (BPCI), which was approved a s part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA ) of 2010. The legislation aims to reduc e spending on prescription drugs b y permitting \"highly similar\" version s of biotech therapies to come to mar - ket based on less-extensive nonclinica l and clinical data than was required t o approve the original reference drug . Manufacturers talk of marketing bi - osimilars at discounts of 25-30% of f branded products, but reimbursemen t experts say that prices that are just 10 % lower will be able to gain market share , particularly for therapies that hav e high price tags to start . BPCI gives FDA the task of estab - lishing a process that will encourag e development of biosimilars that mee t all standards for product safety, purity , and potency. No \"clinically meaningfu l differences\" should exist between th e new biologic and the reference product . Both should use the same mechanis m of action and have the same route of ad - ministration, dosage form, and strengt h (see sidebar, \"Ensuring comparabili y and similarity\"). A biosimilar also ha s to be manufactured, processed, pack - aged, and stored in facilities that mee t GMP standards .

User fees. FDA also is moving forward with a user-fee schedule for biosimilars. The agency proposes to set fees similar to those for innovator drugs and biolog- ics, but will take a new approach to help finance FDA's extensive involvement in steering sponsors through the develop- ment process. The plan is for manufac- turers to pay a product development fee of $150,000 with submission of an investigational new drug application and annually thereafter; those upfront payments would be subtracted from the eventual application fee. Performance goals for approving applications would apply to applications submitted within two years of the expiration of exclusiv- ity for the reference product, but not to applications for products that have years to wait before they can enter the market. The application process . Even with- out final guidance, FDA officials say they're ready to evaluate biosimilar ap- plications on an individual basis. \"We were open for business a year ago,\" said Steven Kozlowski, director of CDER's Office of Biotechnology Products, at the \"Future of Biosimilars\" conference in May 2011, jointly sponsored by the Drug Information Association (DIA) and the Food and Drug Law Institute (FDLI). So far, no manufacturers have attempted the 351(k) approval route for biosimilars authorized by BPCI and are instead continuing to use established drug-approval procedures for some follow-on versions of proteins. If FDA testing requirements and other poli- cies make the biosimilars pathway too arduous, manufacturers say they may use the traditional biologic license ap- plication (BLA) and sidestep the 351(k) route altogether. In devising guidance, FDA has to tackle some basic issues, such as which products fall under the new regulatory program. BPCI extends the definition of biologics to most proteins beginning in March 2020. That definition raises questions about how the change will affect manufacturers of human growth hormones and other proteins, and how they should proceed during the nine- year transition period. Reference products. A thorny subject is whether FDA can approve a biosimi- lar based on a reference product that is approved overseas, but not in the United States. BPCI says that reference products have to be licensed by FDA, but biosimilars manufacturers want flexibility to permit comparison with a biologic licensed by a foreign regula- tory body under certain circumstances. This approach is important for global biosimilar-development programs, pointed out John Pakulski, head of US biopharmaceutical regulatory affairs at Sandoz, at the DIA/FDLI conference. If every country or region requires local trials using locally sourced products, he observed, that could undermine efforts to establish a less-costly abbreviated de- velopment program. Pakulski and others propose a science- based approach that permits the use of foreign reference products when they are made by a US manufacturer or in a facil- ity inspected by FDA; licensed in highly regulated markets, such as Europe or Japan; and have a sufficient postmarket- ing history to confirm safety, purity. and potency. Additional scientific data could be required on a case-by-case basis to es- tablish comparability between a US and foreign-sourced reference product. Another contentious question is whether biosimilar manufacturers can extrapolate data from a clinical study to other indications of the reference product. European regulatory authori- ties permit this if the added indication involves the same mechanism of action and same receptor, and if extrapola- tion of immunogenicity data applies to a lower-risk population or route of administration. Biosimilar-drug spon- sors indicate that extrapolation may be appropriate if supported by open-label safety studies for each indication. Interchangeability issues A key challenge for FDA is to define in- terchangeability testing requirements and whether clinical switching studies will be required. Manufacturers want products to qualify as interchangeable because the first follow-on biologic so deemed by FDA enjoys a year of market exclusivity, during which FDA may not approve another similar interchange- able product. The designation also is important for acceptance by patients and healthcare professionals, and for possible substitution by pharmacists and prescribers. Gordon Johnson, vice-president of the Generic Pharmaceutical Associa- tion, noted at the DIA/FDLI meeting that switching studies are not required for innovator manufacturers to docu- ment comparability following postap- proval changes. Gillian Woollett, chief scientist at the law firm Engel & Novitt, added during the conference that docu- menting comparability to the innova- tor inherently supports a finding on interchangeability. Innovator biologics experience batch-to-batch variability over the product's life time, Woollett observed, and that kind of variability should be accepted in biosimilars. Yet, innovators maintain that clini- cal studies in multiple populations with different risk-benefit profiles are necessary to document that there are no greater risks of safety problems or efficacy differences with product switching. Amgen Vice-President Anthony Mire-Sluis maintained that head-to-head studies are needed to compare immunogenicity between reference and follow-on biotechnol- ogy products, and that different assays can yield different rates of immuno- genicity. He also wants product labels to state explicitly the approved indica- tions of a therapy and whether a bi- osimilar is interchangeable for that use. The potential for product naming and coding to drive coverage and reim- bursement generates heated debate on those topics. Innovator firms maintain that biosimilars should have unique names to distinguish them from ref- erence products, an issue that BPCI failed to address. Different names can ensure traceability of adverse events, reduce confusion about interchange- ability, and prevent dispensing errors. SINGLE-USE TECHNOLOGY New STR.

Some physicians propose unique names only for noninterchangeable biosimilars. European Union guidance calls for bi- osimilars to have different names, but most relate to innovator products. FDA officials may seek to promote safety with names that differentiate similar versions of a drug. Product coding raises related issues. Innovators want biosimilars to have their own reimbursement codes, while biosimilars makers want the same code for all drugs in the same class. A dozen human growth hormone products have the same Medicare reimbursement code and thus receive the same rate of reimbursement, explained attorney Laura Loeb of King & Spalding. But even without interchangeability status and common codes, Loeb predicts that it will be difficult for more expensive reference products to maintain mar-ket share. Formulary committees and state Medicaid programs, she points out, can drive prescribing through formulary placement, higher copays, prior authorization, and requiring- step therapy procedures for reference products. \"The burden will be on the reference product to prove superiority to the biosimilar,\" Loeb observed, \"not the other way around.\" Exclusivity Even though BPCI provides 12 years' exclusivity for innovator biologics, a period when FDA cannot approve a product based on innovator data, the subject is far from settled. Innovators also gain a four-year delay follow- ing reference-product licensure dur- ing which time biosimilars sponsors cannot submit a 351(k) application. Biotech companies consider these protections crucial for encouraging investment in research and develop- ment. Critics, however, claim that 12 years exclusivity is too long, and the Obama administration recently pro- posed reducing exclusivity to 7 years.The challenge for biosimilars developers is to demonstrate that product quality attributes, molecular structures, and biological and immunochemical functions are similar to those of the reference product, even though they are produced from a different cell line and based on unique processes. Full analytical characterization of biosimilar products is essential to understand the chemical structure, physical properties, impurity profile, and degradation pathways, and to determine the effect of process change on the drug substance. Complex compound structures and manufacturing processes add to the difficulty in replicating biological products, and different starting materials can yield different impurity profiles, explained Paraxel Vice-President Cecil Nick at the Drug Information Association/Food and Drug Law Institute biosimilars conference in May 2011. To be a biosimilar, a product should have an identical amino-acid sequence, indistinguishable folding, and a similar glycoprofile, and any differences must be justified. While fluctuations in temperature, pH, solvents, and surface interactions can affect protein folding, improved methods can better evaluate compound structure and measure heterogeneity. One tricky issue for FDA officials and manufacturers is that \"drift\" in quality attributes of a reference product may cloud the comparability picture. A steady shift in reference-product attributes over time, which can result from changes in materials and modifications in procedures, equipment, or facilities, could affect prior findings of safety and efficacy between the innovator and biosimilar and thereby, raise questions about ongoing interchangeability. Beyond documenting biosimilarity based on molecular structure and in vitro assays, a demonstration of equivalence will involve nonclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies, as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic testing in humans. Additional clinical studies will be needed to document equivalent efficacy in at least one approved indication. Yet, even innovator firms acknowledge that an appropriate biosimilar pathway would involve less extensive animal toxicity testing and reductions in dose finding and Phase II clinical trials. Equivalence and noninferiority trials would use active controls (not placebos) for ethical as well as practical reasons.Ensuring comparability and similarity Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 33Washington Report The shorter protection period also aims to minimize exclusivity \"ever- greening,\" which refers to the practice of manufacturers seeking an additional period of protection for products that are modified enough to qualify as new. FDA has to define what changes would sufficiently affect a product's safety, purity, or potency to warrant extended exclusivity. The change has to be sig- nificant, says Kozlowski of CDER. \"I don't think that 'slightly better purity' is enough to extend exclusivity,\" he observed at the DIA/FDLI conference. As with conventional generic drugs, patent and exclusivity issues involving biosimilars are likely to generate ex- tensive regulatory maneuvering and lengthy court battles. Manufacturers on both sides of the market are ex- pected to file citizens' petitions chal- lenging FDA's interpretation of BPCI, particularly regarding how it defines \"biosimilar\" and what constitutes \"in- terchangeability.\" The legislation establishes an even more complex system for dealing with patent and regulatory disputes than applies to conventional generic drugs. Unlike the Hatch-Waxman Act, BPCI doesn't directly involve FDA in list- ing patents. Instead, the law requires biosimilars developers to provide reference-product makers with a full dossier on its process and product so that the innovator can identify those patents it feels may be infringed. This \"hokey-pokey process,\" explained Sid- ley Austin Attorney Jeffrey Kushan, was designed to promote early agree- ment on those patents worth fighting about. But Kushan fears it will create a more complicated litigation process involving multiple deadlines and re- quirements that will please no one. Biosimilars makers complain that too many parties will see their confidential regulatory filings, while BLA-holders stand to lose protection if they fail to follow all the rules. If the 351(k) pro- cess becomes too contentious and costly as a result, biosimilars sponsors may opt to follow the traditional BLA route to market, which offers the re- ward of 12 years' exclusivity. PT 34 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 PharmTech.comBio Forum image: STOCKBYTe/geTTY imageS PharmTech.com/bio The first-quarter 2011 MoneyTree Re- port by PwC US and the National Venture Capital Association, which tracks venture-capital financing, pres- ents a case for cautious optimism. The report, based on data from Thomson Reuters, showed modest growth of 5% in terms of dollars invested in the US bio- technology industry on a year-over-year basis. Funding rose to $784 million in the first quarter of 2011, compared with $746 million in the first quarter of 2010. The increase followed a disappointing second half of 2010, when the biotechnol- ogy industry slipped into second place behind the software industry in share of venture dollars captured. The increase for the first quarter, although promising, lagged the 13.7% year-over-year growth rate of all sectors combined. Deal volume presented a some- what bleaker picture. Compared with the first quarter of 2010, the number of venture-capital deals declined 21% from 107 to 85. The 2011 first-quarter deal vol- ume marked the fewest number of bio- technology deals in a single quarter since the second quarter of 2003. Deal volume for all sectors combined also declined, but the number for biotechnology fell further. The average biotechnology deal size, however, was a bright spot, up 32% year- over-year to $9.2 million, which outper- formed the $8-million average for all industries. On the down side, the bio- technology industry captured only one of the top 10 venture-capital deals in the first quarter\u2014$72 million in early-stage financing for a provider of biotechnology research services.Early-stage funding for biotechnology companies declined by 4% year-over-year to $442 million in the first quarter of 2011, but late-stage funding increased by 19% to $342 million. First-time funding dropped dramatically by 44%, but follow-on fund- ing grew 18%. A total of $697 million went into 62 follow-on deals; $88 million went into 23 first-time deals. Fewer deals and smaller deal size are the norm for fledgling companies. Early- stage biotechnology companies may be a decade away from generating revenue. Lengthy and costly research and develop- ment and uncertainty in the regulatory approval process continue to drive more investors toward follow-on and later-stage deals with companies that are closer to suc- cessful product launches or the exit market. Overall, the biotechnology industry dropped to third place behind the soft- ware and industrial/energy sectors in the dollar amount invested in the first quarter of 2011, but the combined performance of biotechnology and medical devices, the other life-sciences sector, showed contin- ued strength. The mass exodus from bio- technology that some analysts had feared did not happen. Considering the level of capital and time required for drug dis- covery and development, investors must sharpen their pencils when looking at the potential return of biotechnology invest- ment. Despite the challenges of long lead times to revenue generation and the unpre- dictability of regulatory approval, investors recognize that demographic trends point to growth potential. The global population is aging, which is expected to lead to higher consumption of pharmaceuticals. Chronic conditions, such as diabetes and heart dis- ease, already epidemic in the US, are rap- idly extending into developing countries. Competition for biotechnology invest- ment dollars remained heated in early 2011. The San Francisco Bay area, New York Metro, Boston, San Diego Metro, and the North Carolina Research Triangle area received the most biotechnology venture- capital dollars during the first quarter of 2011. The San Francisco Bay area captured the highest amount at $248 million, but New York Metro, at $130 million, showed the largest percentage increase. Exit activity in the biotechnology in- dustry has picked up since the doldrums of 2008 and 2009. Four of the 14 venture- backed initial public offerings (IPOs) dur- ing the first quarter of 2011 were from biotechnology companies. Some analysts noted weakening biotechnology demand because most of those companies that went public with venture-backed IPOs this year have seen offering prices below what they had expected. Still, the acceleration in over- all IPO activity bodes well. The biotechnology industry captured only six of the 109 venture-backed mergers and acquisitions (M&A) for the first quar- ter of 2011 . M&A biotechnology deal activ- ity is expected to pick up as the year pro- gresses, and Big Pharma and Big Biotech continue to ferret out deals to infuse their pipelines. Overall, for companies that can develop the right products, especially bio- logics, to meet the high demand for treat- ments for cancer and rare diseases, investor interest is expected to remain high.

Injectable products that offer controlled drug re- lease can reduce the frequency of injec- tions, which makes it easier for patients to remain compliant. Sustained-release injectables also can offer therapeutic advantages and enhance the quality of patients' lives. Demand for these medicines is increasing, and the desire to extend the patents of branded bio- logics likely will lead to innovations in controlled-release applications. Polymeric microspheres One controlled-release technique suit- able for biopharmaceuticals is based on polymeric microspheres. In this method, manufacturers use polymers to construct a biodegradable matrix within which a drug can be encapsu- lated. By choosing polymers with the proper characteristics, and by modi- fying the matrix properties, manufac- turers can establish the desired release profile for the drug. Biodegradable mi- crosphere systems can deliver peptides, proteins, nucleic-acid-based drugs, and even small molecules, says Ramin Dar- vari, senior principal scientist for novel delivery technologies at Pfizer. Drugmakers can form the micro- spheres by creating oil-water emul- sions. The process uses an immiscible aqueous-organic solvent system that formulators can design to accommo- date various presentations of the drug compound, including aqueous solu- tions and dry particles. \"Although tra- ditional emulsion-based processes rely on exerting high shear on the system to generate the desired particle-size dis- tribution, recent advances in emulsion- based particle-engineering processes have made it possible to achieve more precise control of the particle-size dis- tribution\" without the high shear that could denature a therapeutic protein, says Darvari. Manufacturers must extract solvents such as methylene chloride and ethyl acetate from the emulsion to form the particles and remove the residual solvent through freeze-drying or spray-drying. An alternative approach to avoid solvents is to use hot-melt encapsulation to create microspheres for heat-tolerant molecules. Manufacturers can choose among various synthetic and natural biodegrad- able polymers to create injectable micro- spheres. Most often, opt synthetic as polyesters, poly(orthoesters), family of poly- ester copolymers is used extensively in drug delivery. PLGA might have some undesirable attributes, however. The compound exhibits bulk degradation, rather than surface degradation, which fosters the formation of the polymer's acidic degradation byproducts, lactic acid and glycolic acid. These byproducts, in turn, reduce the pH of the microenvi- ronment within the matrix. This effect might cause drug degradation within the matrix, as well as irritation and discom- fort at the site of injection, says Darvari. This problem can be mitigated by add- ing buffering or neutralizing agents to the formulation, thus allowing PLGA to be used safely and successfully in controlled-release injectables. The polymeric matrix controls drug release by acting as a diffusion barrier that determines the rate at which the drug payload dissolves. The barrier also controls the rate at which the dissolved payload diffuses from the matrix. For- mulators could modify the polymeric matrix to create release mechanisms that range from diffusion-based to degradation-based systems. The release rate from a microsphere partly depends on the composition of the polymer. For example, the release rate from a PLGA microsphere is af- fected by the ratio of lactide to gly- colide, says Darvari. Molecular weight is an important factor, too. Polymers with high molecular weights generally release their payloads at a slower rate, says Mathew Cherian, director of global research and development for Hospira. The polymers' hydrophilicity, hydro- phobicity, particle morphology, and surface charge also can affect the drug's release profile. Polymeric microsphere systems allow for a broad range of release pro- files, including sustained release with zero-order and first-order kinetics, delayed release, and pulsatile release. The polymer composition also can be modified to provide an initial release of drug substance before the delivery rate stabilizes at a lower rate. \"The degree of polymerization, and consequently the molecular weight, modulates the release rate,\" says Cherian. \"By using two or more molecular-weight ranges in sepa- rate steps, during formulation, multiple release rates can be obtained.\" The most common goal, especially for treating chronic diseases, is a con- Calling the Shots Innovation in Controlled-Release Injectables Erik Greb and Rich Whitworth High demand could lead to novel formulations.

Polymeric microspheres can provide sustained drug release for one week, or for as long as a month. Some companies are developing products with release profiles of three months or more. Life- science company Peptron has a three- month formulation of leuprolide in clinical trials. Eligard (leuprolide) from Atrix Laboratories has a three-month profile. Debiopharm has a triptorelin- embonate formulation capable of deliv-ering for as long as six months. In addition to the wide range of re- lease profiles that they enable, poly- meric microspheres have other advan- tages. The synthetic polymers can be readily synthesized in a narrow range of properties (e.g., molecular weight, viscosity, and comonomer ratio). Then the classification and adherence to standards could be reliably achieved by common methods of analysis. PLGA polymers also are nonim-munogenic. Because they eventually degrade to their original monomeric components, the microsphere can act as an injectable depot system without the need for removing the matrix once the depot is depleted. Microspheres also can enhance the safety of potent drugs by preventing an initial dosage spike upon adminis- tration. By encapsulating the drug and controlling its release, microspheres avoid the spike in blood levels seen after the injection of unencapsulated drugs. The PRINT technique The pharmaceutical industry has fre- quently benefited from technologies de- veloped in other industries. The method called Particle Replication in Nonwetting Templates (PRINT), which is based on technologies used to make transistors for the computer industry, potentially could be applied to making controlled- release injectable drugs. A team led by Joseph DeSimone, a chemistry profes- sor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, developed PRINT, which gives companies increased control of the size and shape of drug particles. In this technique, scientists pour a drug solution into a template that forms particles with the desired dimen- sions and form. The solution is some- times formulated with surfactants or lipids, and the resulting particles are colloids that are either stabilized steri- cally (e.g., through the incorporation of polyethylene glycol) or electrostatically (i.e., though a charge), says DeSimone. Formulators disperse these particles in phosphate buffer. When an emulsion is used to create PLGA microspheres, a fraction of the Cover Story: Controlled Release Particle replication in nonwetting templates is based on technologies used to make transistors. 3800 CAMP CREEK PARKWAY BLDG. 2600 SUITE 120 ATLANTA, GA 30331 PHONE: 678-553-3400 FAX: www.gemu.comExperience MORE Combi Pilot/Switch Tank ValveSteam Valve Unique Automation Concepts Solution Driven Innovative Product Development Customized Multiport Solutions Pro-active Project ManagementCompact Multiport T Bonnet with lockout New Jersey 07004 mgamerica.com 866-962-3090 973-808-8185FOR A WORLD OF Just because you have multiple needs doesn't mean you need to call on multiple equipment companies.

The amount of drug loaded into PLGA microspheres is con- sequently limited because it is difficult to control partition coefficients. In contrast, the PRINT technique enables manufac- turers to make PLGA particles that con- tain 40% drug. \"That's three or four times higher than anyone in the literature has been able to achieve,\" says DeSimone. One way that scientists can control drug release from a PRINT particle is by using degradable polymers, such as PLGA, as the particle matrix. The poly- mer's properties can be exploited or modi- fied to achieve the desired release profile. The electrostatic interactions and the solubility characteristics between the par- ticle matrix and the drug cargo that it con- tains can be adjusted. The more similar the polymer's characteristics are to those of the drug, the higher solubility the drug will have in the polymer. Another method would be to incorporate prodrugs into the PRINT particles. Formulators choose pro- drug linkers with the appropriate rates of degradation to ensure that the drug is re- leased from the carriers at the desired rate. Particle size and shape also can affect a drug's release rate because different sizes and shapes have different surface-area- to-volume ratios. \"Generally, if one has a set volume of particle, decreasing particle size will increase the available surface area for water contact, and thus increase the release rate,\" says DeSimone. Shapes, such as spheres, which minimize surface area to volume, have decreased drug-release rates, he adds. Through the PRINT tech- nique, surface-area-to-volume ratios can be adjusted to achieve the required release rate for the product. PRINT also can help extend a drug carrier's elimination half life, thus keep- ing it in the body longer (1). The more de- formable a drug particle is, the more eas- ily it can bypass biological barriers such as the lung and spleen, and the longer its elimination half-life. Rigid particles tend to get stuck in small capillaries. DeSimone's team made particles that were 1.5 m thick and 6 m in diameter to mimic the properties of red blood cells. \"We systematically varied the degree of de- formability. When we matched the degree of deformability of a red blood cell, we had a 30-fold increase in elimination half life. We had a four-day elimination half-life for a 6-m diameter particle, which is really unheard of,\" says DeSimone. Because the PRINT technique offers enhanced control over particle properties, including size, shape, chemistry, and sur- face area, it could enable a wider range of release rates for injectable drugs compared with manufacturing techniques, such as emulsions, says DeSimone. The method also allows manufacturers to load particles with more types of drugs than other tech-niques do, including hydrophilic, hydro- phobic, and biomacromolecules. He adds that PRINT can modify the particle matrix easily, thus establishing the desired release profile. \"The precise control over numer- ous particle parameters is what makes PRINT so versatile,\" says DeSimone. Solid-dose injection Several options for controlled-release in- jectable dosage forms, though effective, require somewhat complicated formula- tions that present unique manufacturing challenges. Injectable controlled-release drugs are traditionally in liquid form be- cause of the constraints of the standard needle-and-syringe delivery method, which limits formulation options. The ability to retain a solid formula- tion offers several advantages, not least in terms of stability. The injection of solid doses is not a new concept; drug implants have been around for some time. Astra- Zeneca's Zoladex (goserelin), for example, was introduced more than 20 years ago. Used to treat prostate cancer, the 10.8-mg implant must be injected by a healthcare professional through a 14-gauge needle with an aseptic technique. \"Not particu- larly pleasant,\" says Charles Potter, chief technical officer at specialty pharmaceu- tical company Glide Pharma. However, the formulation does offer sustained re- lease over a 12-week period and makes such injections relatively infrequent. Particle replication in nonwetting templates can produce shapes that mimic (left) red blood cells and (right) metastatic cancer cells. images are courtesy of joseph desimone and timothy merkel of the university of north carolinaPharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 41Taking the idea of an implant one step further, Potter asked, \"Why not use the drug as the needle? If the for- mulation can be made solid enough, it can be formed into a sharp point.\" That premise is the basis of Glide Pharma's Solid Dose Injector (SDI) technology, which uses a solid, homogenous mix- ture of drug and excipient. In controlled-release formulations, the excipients used are biodegradable polymeric compounds, such as PLGA or polyethylene glycol, that are compat- ible with the Glide implant manufactur- ing process. By blending various grades of polymer, changing the ratio of drug to polymer, and manipulating process conditions, varied release profiles can be created with Glide formulations. On the other hand, if immediate release is required, the formulation would require quick-dissolving excipients, such as a single sugar or a blend of sugars that provide the physical strength required, but dissolve within seconds in the tis- sue. And although other excipients may be required to increase stability, such as for thermally labile biological macromolecules, formulations remain relatively simple. The manufacturing process for the solid dosage form is also simple: the ac- tive ingredient and a blend of selected ex- cipients are mixed together and passed through a standard twin-screw extruder, usually at room temperature to ensure that the active ingredient is not damaged. The spaghetti-like extrudate is then cut into individual doses that are pointed at one end and flat at the other. The drug implant is loaded into a sterile cassette and pushed directly into the tissue using a simple, reusable spring-driven actuator. The rate of degradation of the polymeric matrix within the tissue controls the re- lease of the drug. Potent drugs are good candidates for the company's solid-dose injection tech- nology because they are administered in small doses that can be delivered easily as small implants. Beyond dosage size, Glide's technology does not seem limited by drug type. \"We've got some very excit- ing vaccine data where we've shown the potential for better efficacy than a needle and syringe, and we've worked with sev- eral peptides and proteins,\" says Potter. Looking to the future, Potter sees a po- tential market in the treatment of Type II diabetes because of Glide SDI's suitability to self-administered drugs. \"Type II dia- betics need a basal layer of insulin across the day. We can address Type II diabetes with our system, but different people need different levels, so we would need several dose levels for our formulations.\"Conclusion Scientists are refining current tech- nologies and developing new means of controlling the release of injectable drugs. Patients seem likely to benefit from further innovations. Reference 1. T.J. Merkel et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108 (2), 586-591 (2011).

The characteristics of a pharmaceutical's composite particles can affect the product in many ways, includ- ing by influencing drug efficacy and sta- bility, as well as how the product behaves during processing. When considering the importance of particle characteriza- tion, the International Conference on Harmonization's (ICH) Q6A guideline on specifications (1) is a useful starting point because it identifies potentially important particle variables, including polymorphic form, enantiomeric purity, and particle size and distribution. The guideline also provides a decision tree to help determine when related testing is required. Historically, industry has paid greater attention to control of particle size and distribution, which, according to ICH Q6A, can significantly affect the dissolu- tion rates, bioavailability, and stability of drug substances in both solid and suspen- sion products. Today, particle character- istics are attracting even greater focus as industry strives to increase manufactur- ing efficiencies. This drive has been largely influenced by the growing emphasis on quality by design (QbD), which encour- ages pharmaceutical companies to use an information- and risk-based approach to optimize product development and manu- facture. Using particle characterization to understand how a product behaves during processing supports this initiative.This article takes a brief look at what factors have driven innovations in particle- characterization techniques and how technology may advance in this area in the coming years. Innovations in particle characterization Two of the earliest particle-sizing tech- niques were manual microscopy and siev- ing. These methods are still used today, but both have drawbacks. For instance, microscopy is slow and manually intensive, while sieving is unsuitable for fine or cohe- sive materials. As such, industry has sought more advanced particle-sizing techniques. One such approach that is gaining pop- ularity is laser diffraction. \"Although laser diffraction methods have been used for the last 30 years, continuous development has resulted in much more accurate and repro- ducible measurements between manufac- turers,\" explains Graham Rideal, founder of and a senior scientist at Whitehouse Scientific, which specializes in particle- sizing methods. Paul Kippax, product group manager at Malvern Instruments, a producer of analytical equipment, agrees that laser dif- fraction is an important technology, par- ticularly because its measurement range (0.1 to 3000 \u00b5) covers the vast majority of particle-sizing applications used by indus- try. In addition, laser diffraction is capable of high-speed size distribution sampling (typically less than 20 s, according to Kip- pax), is nondestructive, and is suitable for automation. \"Today's laboratory laser dif-fraction analyzers have been automated to the point of push-button operation, with sample loading being the only remaining routine manual task,\" says Kippax. Imaging and microscopy are not being left behind, however. Some recent advances have been made with these analytical tech- niques. \"The continuous and concomitant development of imaging technology and high-speed computers has transformed the humble microscope from a predominantly qualitative instrument into one of the most potent quantitative tools available today,\" explains Rideal. \"This development has extended the definition of a particle from that of a simple equivalent spherical diam- eter into a comprehensive shape analysis where length, width, and perimeter can be measured at tremendous speeds.\" Indeed, during the past few years, in- dustry has placed a growing emphasis on particle characteristics other than size, such as shape, surface charge, and rough- ness. \"Particle sizing is just one element of particle characterization,\" says Rideal. \"Other disciplines in this sector include particle shape, flow properties, both in the dry state and as suspensions (rheology), morphology\u2014including crystal struc- ture, and porosity. Particle sizing alone is therefore not always the sole answer to ef- ficacy.... A combination of physical prop- erties is invariably investigated in arriving at the final solution.\" According to Kippax, particle shape, in particular, has become an important parameter for both processing and final product quality. \"In direct compression tableting, for example, shape is known to have an impact on blend uniformity, the consistency of powder flow through the press, compressibility, and the mechanical strength of the finished tablet,\" he says. \"On the imaging front, many are also already looking beyond shape to composition.\" Process development Understanding particle characteristics can benefit process development in sev- eral ways. The latest technologies, such as the on-line laser-diffraction systems noted above, enable processes to be monitored in real time during development work, which provides better control and facilitates scale up. \"The sector's interest in on-line, real- time measurement has risen sharply as it S/p.sc/e.sc/c.sc/i.sc/a.sc/l.sc R/e.sc/p.sc/o.sc/r.sc/t.sc: /p.sc/a.sc/r.sc/t.sc/i.sc/c.sc/l.sc/e.sc /c.sc/h.sc/a.sc/r.sc/a.sc/c.sc/t.sc/e.sc/r.sc/i.sc/z.sc/a.sc/t.sc/i.sc/o.sc/n.sc How pharma's drive for manufacturing efficiency has bolstered interest in and technologies for particle characterization.

Tim Freeman, director of opera- tions at Freeman Technology, which spe- cializes in powder characterization, adds, \"I would perhaps highlight particle shape analysis\u2014automated imaging\u2014as a prime example of a technique with proven appli- cability, that would be a desirable addition to the real-time selection for pharma, but has yet to make this transition.\" Another way that particle characteriza- tion can benefit process development is through simulation, which involves using characterization data to construct math- ematical models that predict process per- formance. These models, if robust, can be used to conduct virtual experiments. \"The big attraction of process simula- tion is that it allows virtual experimenta-tion, which is cheaper and quicker than the laboratory or pilot scale equivalent,\" explains Kippax. \"The drawback is the effort required to develop a reliable model.\" Despite this, however, Kippax added that he expects process simulation to become more widely used within in the industry in the coming years because of the potential it has for aiding scale up and troubleshooting. Future advances Particle characterization has come a long way from its early days, but there is al- ways room for more progress. \"The next major development in particle sizing is likely to be in measuring in three dimen- sions,\" says Rideal. \"Computer technol- ogy will be a driving force where the cur- rent impressive computer graphics from the film industry will be incorporated into particle sizing. There is also a move to borrow technology from the medical world, so expect to see X-ray CAT scans and MRI instruments appearing in the particle-metrology laboratory.\" Meanwhile, Kippax is hopeful that there will be more advances in laser diffraction. \"One goal is to make the performance gains already made more universally ac- cessible. Greater embedded support during method development and throughout the measurement process, for example, would ensure that even inexperienced users could fully exploit the technology.\" With such improvements on the hori- zon, industry's main challenge may not stem from technology, but rather from the skill of the operator using it. \"Just because an instrument costs in excess of $100000 does not mean that the results are any bet- ter than using a sieve costing \u00a3100,\" says old adage of been so relevant.\" Reference 1.

API manufacturers are tasked with screen- ing, detecting, and characterizing various physical forms, such as polymorphs, sol- vates, amorphous materials, and partially disordered materials. Applying solid- state chemistry, however, can be a time- consuming and difficult job, and several recent developments point to ways to facili- tate the search for the optimal solid form. The task at hand \"It is important to apply the most appropri- ate means of characterizing or identifying all physical forms,\" says Seenu Srinivasan, PhD, global vice-president and chief scien-tific officer of CMC pharmaceutical devel- opment services at Covance. \"On choosing the preferred physical form, a robust crys- tallization or preparation process needs to be developed, preferably using solvents that are safe, available in large quantities, and are environmentally friendly. Generally, the thermodynamically most stable form is preferred for development. However, in some cases, it may be necessary to prog- ress metastable crystalline forms, solvates, hydrates, or even amorphous materials.\" He adds that co-crystals, where more than one molecular entity is incorporated into the crystalline unit cell, can be consid- ered as well. \"The latter approach is useful for pharmaceutically engineering the prop- erties of a drug substance when no ioniz- able moieties are present in the parent mol- ecule,\" he says. Even when the product is not administered as a solid dose, the physi- cal form of the drug substance should be characterized as fully as possible to ensure that there is no interbatch variability, which may in turn affect, for example, reconstitu- tion time or chemical stability. \"We have seen many examples where very subtle variations in physical properties of differ- IMAGE: JASON REED / GETTY IMAGESThe solid form of an API plays a crucial role in drug quality, and advancing methods for screening, detection, and characterization is key.

Decisions to be made The optimal physical form is based on several factors, which may be influenced by the target product profile, including bioavailability, physical and chemical stability, desired dissolution properties, the impurity profile of the API, drug- substance hygroscopicity, morphology, size distribution, compaction properties, and ability to formulate. \"The higher ranking of these criteria for a particular API is used in the decision to choose a free molecule, salt form, or co-crystal,\" explains Laurent Lafferrere, PhD, head of CMC development services in Porchev- ille, France, at Covance. Identifying polymorphs, where a drug substance exists in two or more crystalline phases, is crucial. Polymorph stability is evaluated experimentally by monitoring the phase transition of the different poly- morphs in different crystallization media and at different temperatures by using in-situ monitoring probes and analyti- cal solid-state methods, explains Laffer- rere. These data are used to manufacture the desired polymorph and to control it through the various manufacturing steps. Polymorphs can undergo phase transitions when exposed to a range of manufacturing processes, such as drying, milling, micronization, wet granulation, spray drying, and compaction. Exposure to environmental conditions, such as hu- midity and temperature, also can induce polymorph transition. The extent of tran- sition depends on the relative stability of the polymorphs, kinetic barriers to phase transition, and applied stress. The physical stability of polymorphs may be monotropic or enantiotropic, where the relative thermodynamic stabil- ity between the two forms can be inverted with temperature. Additional consider- ations are made when the physical form of the drug-substance may be modified in the formulation process, such as in hot-melt, lyophilization, solubilization, or suspension in a semisolid matrix, says Lafferrere. Also, drug substance-excipient interactions are considered when stabilizing particular physical and other process parameters that may affect the performance or quality of the final product.

The transformation of meta- stable states and extended solvent-based studies conducted under a range of crystal- lization conditions, such different concen-trations, temperatures, cooling rates, and stirring rates, are examined. The effect of different impurity profiles and seeding ex- periments are further considered. \"Of course, one should never forget that one of the principal criteria for recrystal- lization may be to obtain a desired target purity, with control over both the impurity profile and residual solvents, in addition to obtaining a defined physical quality. Under some circumstances, we apply controlled stress to the API in a variety of carefully chosen matrices to afford physical forms not normally readily obtained by other means,\" says Byard. As development progresses to Phases II and III, there is an increased emphasis on the most appropriate crystal morphology, crystal quality, and crystal-size distribution for the commercial formulation and also definition of specifications for the physical quality of API, explains Byard. Verification Formulation development forum: controlled agglomeration for poorly soluble drugs Improving the solubility of poorly soluble drugs is an ongoing challenge. Dispersing a poorly soluble compound in a polymeric matrix to improve solubility and therefore bioavailability is one strategy. To produce the solid solutions or solid dispersions, various methods can be used, such as hot-melt extrusion, spray-drying, melt congelation, and nanocrystal technology (1). LifeCycle Pharma, a technology spinoff from the Danish pharmaceutical company H. Lundbeck, uses a proprietary process, MeltDose, based on controlled agglomeration, to address the problem of poorly soluble drugs. \"Several technologies have been launched to deal with poorly soluble drugs,\" explains Peter Nielsen, executive vice-president of pharmaceutical development and CMC at LifeCycle Pharma. \"Some technologies manipulate the particle size of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and others influence dissolution rate. We see MeltDose as a technology that achieves all these improvements within the same technology.\" Nielsen explains the company's approach. A low water-soluble drug substance is dissolved in a vehicle system that is optimized for each drug substance. The drug substance is spray-dried on an inert particulate carrier using fluid-bed equipment and solidified when disposed on the carrier. The carrier captures the active drug in a nanocrystalline or microcrystalline state or as an amorphous solid dispersion. This step is followed by agglomeration that is controlled by optimizing temperature and feed rate to produce the granules, which are directly compressed into tablets. Once in tablet form, the dissolution profile and particle size remain stable. The selection of the vehicle to match the physiochemical properties of the API is an important consideration in the process. \"In some formulations, the API will be present as an amorphous solid dispersion, such as in hot-melt extrusion and spray drying, but in other formulations, the API will be present as crystals in nanometer or micrometer size, resembling nanoproducts more,\" says Nielsen. MeltDose, the proprietary process that LifeCycle Pharma has developed, centers on the controlled agglomeration process. \"The controlled agglomeration process has some similarities to fluid-bed granulation,\" says Nielsen. Controlled agglomeration involves placing solid carrier particles in a conventional fluid bed, unto which a liquefied vehicle containing the API is sprayed. When the liquid vehicle is cooled down on the carrier, it agglomerates and forms granules. The controlled agglomeration process is water-free, and in contrast to conventional fluid-bed granulation, uses liquefied (i.e., melted) polymers as the polymeric vehicle. The polymeric vehicle is melted in a specially designed heated melt unit that controls temperature and pressure of the melted vehicle, which passes from the melt unit to a specially designed spray nozzle in the fluid bed, say Nielsen. The produced granules are compressed to tablets using conventional tablet presses.The polymer vehicles used in the MeltDose process can include a range of hydrophilic and lipophilic materials and are selected for their solubility- enhancing properties and compatibility with subsequent processing steps. Examples of vehicle systems are solid or semisolid polymers with a melting point between 40 and 80 \u00b0C, such as polyethylene glycol 6000, poloxamers, and various types of gelucires. The resulting granule size varies with the choice of excipients and lies typically in the range of 200 to 500 /uni03BCm, says Nielsen. The vehicle temperature, the spray rate, the atomizing air volume, and product temperature all are important process parameters to consider during the controlled agglomeration step. Also, the addition of different surfactants can result in different sizes of API crystals in the granule (2). Fenofibrate, a lipid-regulating agent to control cholesterol and marketed as Fenoglide in the United States by Shore Therapeutics, was the first product approved in the US using the MeltDose technology. Fenofibrate was initially approved by FDA in 1993 and later developed by LifeCycle Pharma using the MeltDose process in the formulation. LifeCycle Pharma received FDA approval for Fenoglide to treat hyperlipidemia mixed dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia in 2007 . Sciele Pharma commercialized the product in the US and was subsequently acquired by Shionogi in 2008. In 2010, Shionogi Pharma terminated its Fenoglide North American commercialization agreement with LifeCycle Pharma , transferring commercial rights to Shore Therapeutics. LifeCycle Pharma is working on other formulations that use the MeltDose process. The company has developed a once-daily modified-release formulation of tacrolimus, a poorly soluble compound with a water solubility of 4-12 /uni03BCg/m, and the same API as in Astellas's Prograf, an immunosuppression drug used in kidney and liver transplants. LifeCycle Pharma has developed an amorphous solid-dispersion formulation of tacrolimus. The API was dissolved in a melted vehicle at elevated temperature. The solution was sprayed onto an inert carrier in a fluid bed. The resulting granulate was blended with a disintegrant and lubricant and compressed into tablets. The modified-release tablet formulation using the MeltDose technology was developed and tested in humans and is currently in late Phase III testing for the prevention of organ rejection with kidney transplants. LifeCycle Pharma expects to file for regulatory approval for the product, LCP-Tacro, in the US and European Union in the first quarter of 2013. Sources 1. P. Van Arnum, Pharm.

The critical manufacturing process vari- ables and their ranges are determined and controlled to produce a robust API process that meets established quality attributes. Screening for physical forms takes into account properties of the molecular struc- ture and explores the effects of solvents, temperature, concentration and vari- ous other parameters that can influence crystallization, explains Byard. Many solid forms are generated by the different crystallization approaches, based on the effect of the interfacial energy between the nucleus and the crystallization media, supersaturation (a driving force of crystal- lization), and temperature. The crystalliza- tion methods can be broadly classified into four groups: crystallization by sublimation, melt crystallization, crystallization by spray drying, and crystallization from solution, which is the most commonly used method because it provides data for the crystalliza- tion process development. High-through- put screening methods can be used to cover a wide range of conditions to help ensure that all different forms are recognized. Many complementary techniques exist for characterizing solid forms, such as sin- gle crystal X-ray diffraction, X-ray powder diffraction, solid-state spectroscopy, hot-stage optical microscopy, and thermal analyses. These methods are routinely used and provide the platforms for incremental improvements. Recent advances SSNMR probes samples directly at the mo- lecular level to provide information about structure and mobility. Consequently, the physical form of constituents in either physical or chemical mixtures can be ex- amined with relative ease. \"This makes SSNMR a technique of choice for studying drug products, where the physical form of the active can be determined in a com- plex matrix, even if multiple components are amorphous,\" says Srinivasan. For ex- ample, the presence of physical impurities can be determined when lattice modifica- tions are not altered significantly and, by implication, not readily detected by X-ray powder diffraction (1). In another example, researchers at GlaxoSmithKline reported on SSNMR experiments based on dipolar correlation, spin diffusion, and relaxation measurements to characterize the struc- ture of amorphous solid dispersions (2). rates density functional theory calcula- tions, is used to provide molecular-level information about structure and dynam- ics of drug substances, including solvate characteristics (3, 4). Recently, X-ray pho- toelectron spectroscopy (XPS), in conjunc- tion with SSNMR and density functional theory prediction, was used to determine co-crystal formation (5, 6). \"This too is a promising approach to understanding ex- actly what is happening at the molecular level and, by implication, enabling a sound basis for making decisions about formula- tion processes,\" says Srinivasan. Surface properties and the related methods for characterization also are important considerations. Researchers at the University of Manchester and Sanofi recently reported on using a surface- sensitive technique, XPS, in detecting the free-base surface enrichment of a pharma- ceutical fumarate salt . They reported that a yellow discoloration was observed at the surface of normally white crystals of the fumarate salt, which was preliminary at- tributed to the presence of trace amounts of free base. The samples with yellow surfaces could not be successfully milled, which was an important part of the production pro- cess for providing material of the required physical quality for product formulation. Because no conventional bulk analytical technique could readily provide an expla- nation for the yellow color, the researchers used XPS to characterize the salt. The iden- tification of residual free base at the surface of the crystalline material by XPS was sig- nificant for optimizing the crystallization process to yield material of required quality for milling at the plant scale (7). Crystal-structure prediction is an active area of research. \"Ab initio crystal structure prediction is another promising area as is elucidating hydrogen bonding potential to provide information about the possibility of discovering additional polymorphic forms of a drug substance,\" says Srinivasan. Other approaches Researchers at the University of Missouri recently reported on a new method for con- verting drugs from one crystalline form to another by applying gas-induced transfor- mations of the antibiotic clarithromycin and lansoprazole, in the gastroin- testinal drug Prevacid. For clarithromycin, the researchers converted the kinetic solvent and guest- free crystal forms to the commercially thermodynamically stable polymorph with a reduction in energy costs relative to other commonly used methods. Typical methods involve desolvation of the initial form to a second form, which is heated for 18 h at 110 \u00b0C to finally produce the desired polymorph. In the gas-induced process, the clarithromycin crystals were pressurized with carbon dioxide at 350 psi for direct conversion of the initial form to the final thermodynamically stable form in 4 h. For lansoprazole, the researchers also used car- bon dioxide to convert the ethanol hydrate of lansoprazole to the solvent-free form that is used commercially. This process im- proved the approach used in synthesizing lansoprazole, which involves a solvate that readily decomposes and is stirred in water, filtered, and dried intensively (8, 9). References 1.

Concomitant alcoholic beverage ingestion may modify the release characteristics of ER formulations, causing dose dumping, which may threaten patient safety. FDA recommends that ER medicinal products should be tested during development to ensure dosage form robustness in hydro-alcoholic media. The authors investigate the influence of hydro-alcoholic media on hydration and drug release from PEO ER matrices using two model active pharmaceutical ingredients with different solubilities in water. No matrix failure was recorded for either formulation when exposed to ethanol-water solutions. In addition, pure PEO compacts made of three viscosity grades of polymer showed consistent swelling upon exposure to hydro- alcoholic media.

Accepted: Apr. 5, 2011.Drug Release Hydrophilic matrices are a popular and extensively used strategy for oral extended-release (ER) drug delivery. Hypromellose (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, HPMC) is the polymer of choice as the rate-controlling carrier (1). In addition to HPMC, polyethylene oxide (PEO) has been used as a matrix-forming polymer (2, 3). These excipients are nontoxic and have pH- independent hydration and swelling, good compressibility and lubricity, and versatility due to a wide range of molecular weights. PEO polymers have global regulatory acceptance and can be utilized for modulating the release of drugs at various solubilities and doses (1-13). PEO polymers are white, free-flowing hydrophilic powders commercially available as Polyox (Dow Chemical Company), water soluble resins (WSRs), with molecular weight ranging from 100,000 Da to 7,000,000 Da (14). A list of Polyox grades suitable for ER hydrophilic matrix applications is shown in Table I. When in contact with water, PEO hydrates rapidly, swells to a large extent and forms a gelatinous barrier layer around the tablet (15). Drug release from the PEO matrices is generally controlled by diffusion of the drug through the swollen gel at the surface of the tablet and/or gel erosion (9, 16). The rates of wetting, swelling and erosion are controlled by polymer molecular weight and other ingredients within the matrix (17). Rapid polymer hydration and uniform gel formation are critical to the performance of hydrophilic matrix systems (18). It is also crucial to take into account the type of dissolution media the tablets are exposed to, because it may affect polymer hydration and gel formation.The Influence of Hydro-Alcoholic Media on Drug Release From Polyethylene Oxide Extended-Release Matrix Tablets Dasha Palmer, Marina Levina, Thomas P. Farrell, and Ali R. Rajabi-SiahboomiPharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 51Alcoholic beverages have been consumed for thousands of years, and a United Kingdom National Health Service survey indicated that 73% of men and 57% of women (aged 16 and over) had alcoholic drinks on at least one day per week (19). In another report, US statistical data showed that around 50% of the American population routinely consumed alcoholic beverages (20). The potential effect of alcoholic drinks in significantly accelerating drug release from ER oral formulations has been of some concern (21). It is known that alcohol has an influence on the absorption, metabolism and excretion of drugs, which can potentially lead to adverse side effects (22). Toxicity is most often associated with acute intake rather than longer-term consumption of alcohol, but both patterns can impact the toxico-kinetics of concomitantly administered medicines (23). ER formulations, which are intended for once or twice daily administration, are designed with a higher unit dose of the drug than conventional formulations. Therefore, it is imperative that retardation properties are tightly controlled to ensure that a rapid release of the drug, or dose dumping, cannot occur. In July 2005, FDA published an alert for healthcare professionals regarding the negative effect of alcoholic drinks on drug release from Palladone (hydromorphone). Alcohol breaks down the ER formulation, and, as a result, increases peak plasma concentration causing potentially lethal dose dumping (24). Several publications have outlined the influence of hydro- alcoholic media on the performance of solid oral ER systems in the years since the FDA alert. According to Fadda et al., vulnerable formulations are likely to cause adverse pharmacokinetic and therapeutic outcomes in patients on exposure to alcoholic solutions. The extent of the adverse reaction depends on the drug, polymer, and excipients in the formulation (25, 26). Some oral ER dosage forms contain drugs and excipients that exhibit a higher solubility in aqueous solutions containing ethanol. Accordingly, such products may be expected to exhibit more rapid drug dissolution and release in the presence of ingested ethanol (27). Koziara et al. reported an increased permeability, elasticity, and swelling of cellulose acetate semipermeable Table I: Polyox WSR NF polymers for ER matrix applications.

Although drug release from the analyzed osmotic-controlled release oral deilvery systems increased slightly, it was fully controlled, and no morphological changes to the dosage form occurred. The system maintained its functionality, and no potential for dose dumping was reported. Roberts et al. studied the influence of alcohol on the release of aspirin from HPMC matrix tablets (29). They found that ethanol retarded hydration of the polymer and produced a more rapid initial drug dissolution but overall did not result in dose-dumping. The influence of ethanol on the in vitro release of opioid drugs from various ER formulations (e.g., tablets, capsules, and suspensions) was examined by Walden et al. An extrapolation of the findings to the likely outcome in vivo indicated no risk of dose dumping (27). Traynor et al. studied the potential for dose dumping in hydro-alcoholic media from three commercially available opioid analgesic (tramadol) formulations. The formulations provided 24-h dissolution using release-controlling coatings (30). The authors found that for two products (Ultram ER tablets and T-long capsules), the release of tramadol significantly increased in the presence of alcohol. Conversely, a decrease in the rate of drug release in hydro- alcoholic media was recorded for Tridural ER tablets. Skalsky et al. analyzed the effect of alcoholic beverage concentrations up to 40% (v/v) on model highly water-soluble drugs, succinate, using copolymers and HPMC in matrix formulations (22). Drug- release behavior was unchanged in all media. However, the authors suggested a significant difficulty in correlating in vitro data to potential in vivo results due to the unpredictable effect of alcohol on absorption, metabolism, and excretion from the human body. Levina et al. investigated the effect of hydro-alcoholic solutions on hydration, gel formation, and drug release from HPMC ER tablets and reported that hydro-alcoholic media containing up to 40% ethanol did not affect the performance of the matrices (18). Investigation of the effect of hydro-alcoholic solutions on textural and rheological properties of various controlled-release grades of hypromellose was also described by Missaghi et al. (31). According to Ager et al., the effect of ethanol on pseudoephedrine HCl from HPMC ER matrix systems depended on the qualitative and quantitative composition of the tablets (32). The authors claimed that the drug release may be affected when using a filler with decreased solubility in ethanol (e.g., lactose or starch) and formulations containing fillers that have both poor aqueous and ethanol solubility (e.g., microcrystalline cellulose) might have no effect on drug release. The influence of hydro-alcoholic media on PEO ER matrices has not yet been investigated. This research studies the influence of hydro-alcoholic media on the hydration and swelling properties of pure PEO compacts manufactured using different viscosity grade of Polyox, and drug release from ER matrices using two model drugs with different aqueous solubilities.

Absorbance was measured with a dual-beam UV-vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer) using 5 mm quartz cells at a wavelength of 228 nm and 0.1 mm cells at 233 nm for gliclazide and metformin HCl, respectively. Tablets were analyzed in triplicates using an automated sampling device, and mean with standard deviation values were reported. The drug release profiles in hydro-alcoholic media were compared to those in purified water using the f2 factor. An f2 value between 50 and 100 indicates that the two dissolution profiles are similar (7, 38). To investigate the mechanism of drug release in various media, the release data between 5 and 60% were fitted to the following equation (16, 39-40): Q = ktn (Eq. 1) where Q is the percentage drug released at time t, k is a kinetic constant incorporating structural and geometric characteristics of the tablet and n is the diffusion exponent that indicates the drug release mechanism (39-40). For matrix tablets, an n value close to 0.5 indicates predominantly diffusion control of drug release. An n value around 1.0 indicates erosion or relaxation control mechanism of drug release (41-42). Intermediate values suggest that both diffusion and erosion contribute to the overall release mechanism (18). The values of n and k are inversely related, such that a decrease in n value results in a k value increase. A high k value may suggest a burst drug release from the matrix (43-44). Preparation and testing of PEO compacts. Three viscosity grades of PEO were 1105, 301, and Co- agulant). PEO compacts with a target weight of 300 mg were manufactured using hydraulic automatic press (Auto T8, Atlas, Specac) and 10 mm flat-faced tooling at a compression force of 20 kN (255 MPa). Compacts were tested in a USP- compliant AT7 Sotax dissolution bath using Apparatus II (i.e., paddles) with large (15 \u00d7 31 mm) sinkers (Sotax), mL of 0:100, 25:75 and 50:50 w/v ethanol:purified water mixtures at 100 rpm and 37 \u00b1 0.5 /uni2218C. The swelling properties of the compacts in various media were determined using a modified version of the method described by Tahara et al. and Kavanagh and Corrigan by measuring the wet weight of the hydrated PEO compacts at 15, 30, 60 and 120 mins (45, 46). Each compact was placed into a preweighed plastic container; the excess media was drained and blotted from around the tablet without touching it. The compact and the container were weighed, and the wet weight of each tablet was established. Every determination at each time point was performed in triplicate, and average and standard deviation values were calculated.

Robust PEO ER matrices with strength values of 2.32 MPa (13.0 \u00b1 0.2 kp) for gliclazide kp) for metformin HCl were produced. Reproducible drug release profiles were obtained for both formulations in all tested media. No dose dumping from the PEO matrices was observed even after 12-h exposure to the hydro- alcoholic media. Figure 1 and Table IV show that gliclazide release was not significantly affected by either 1- or 12-h exposure to 5% or 40% w/v ethanol solutions. The differences observed in the dissolution profiles can be attributed to the different solubility of the drug in ethanol (see Table III). Metformin HCl release from PEO ER matrices in hydro- alcoholic media was similar to the dissolution results in water in all the tests ( f2 > 50), with the exception of the 12-h exposure to 40% w/v ethanol ( f2 = 42), where drug release was significantly slower (see Figure 2 and Table IV). This result can be explained by a reduction in metformin HCl solubility from 450 mg/mL in water to 295 mg/mL in 40% v/v ethanol (18). However, such extreme conditions (i.e., high concentration of ethanol during a prolonged period of time) are unlikely for in vivo conditions. In the human body, tablets taken with alcohol are unlikely to be exposed to a 40% v/v hydro-alcoholic medium for a 12-h period because of the rapid absorption of ethanol from the gastro- intestinal tract (18, 33). This study did not reveal any effect on dissolution after 1-h exposure of PEO ER tablets to hydro-alcoholic media for either active. Drug-release variability, in particular with gliclazide, increased when matrices were tested in alcohol. The standard deviation for gliclazide tablets subjected to hydro-alcoholic media increased from 2.3% (no exposure to alcohol) up to 3.6% (exposure to 5% w/v alcohol) and up to 5.6% (exposure to 40% w/v alcohol), respectively (see Figure 1). This result may be due to the influence of ethanol on hydration of the polymer and erosion of the gel structure on the surface of the matrix. The values of the kinetic constant (k), the release exponent ( n), and correlation coefficient ( R2) determined from the drug release data are presented in Table V. As gliclazide is practically insoluble in water and slightly soluble in alcohol (see Table III), its release from ER hydrophilic matrices was expected to occur predominantly by gel erosion. This was confirmed by high n values (1.3-1.4) suggesting that erosion was the main mechanism of gliclazide release from PEO matrices in all studied dissolution media. On the other hand, a combination of diffusion and erosion ( n = 0.6-0.7) was observed with metformin HCl (see Table V), which was anticipated due to its high aqueous drug solubility. Metformin HCl solubility changes from freely soluble in water to slightly soluble in alcohol (see Table III), resulting in a greater erosion contribution to the drug release from the tested PEO matrices. This was reflected by an increase in n value from 0.61 in water to 0.63 and to 0.74 in 5 and 40% w/v ethanol solutions, respectively. These findings agree with the Roberts data showing that ethanol affects the kinetics and mechanism of drug release from hydrophilic matrix tablets, but does not result in dose dumping (29). Because the values of n and k are inversely related, k values changed slightly from 32.96 in water to 33.50 and 24.24 for metformin HCl tablets exposed to 5% and 40% w/v ethanol solutions, respectively. These results imply that the rate of drug release is slightly slower in 40% w/v ethanol solution than in water. For both formulations, greater erosion contribution to the drug release from the tested matrices was observed in ethanol solutions compared with aqueous media. The results of this study identified similar trends to the previously Figure 3: Effect of hydro-alcoholic media containing 0, 25 or 50% w/v ethanol on wet weight of PEO (Polyox 1105, Coagulant) (water) PEO 301 (50% w/v ethanol) 0 15 30 Time (min)Compact wet weight (mg) 60 120PEO 301 (25% w/v ethanol) Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 57published data for HPMC ER matrix systems (18). This finding is interesting in light of gastrointestinal tract motility. According to Bode and Bode, alcohol may interfere with the activity of the muscles surrounding the stomach and the small intestine and thus alter the transit time of food through these organs (48-49). In humans, alcohol's effect on gastric motility depends on the alcohol concentration and accompanying meals. In general, beverages with alcohol concentrations above 15% appear to inhibit gastric motility and thus delay the emptying of the stomach. In the small intestine, alcohol decreases the muscle movements that help retain the food for further digestion (i.e., the impeding wave motility). However, alcohol does not affect the movements that propel food through the intestine (i.e., the propulsive wave motility) in either alcoholics or healthy subjects. It is also important to take into account the solubility of additional excipients (e.g., fillers, bulking agents, and surfactants) used in the formulation. The most popular fillers used in hydrophilic matrix systems can be ranked in ascending order according to their solubility in ethanol: MCC and dicalcium phosphate dehydrate, pregelatinized starch, and lactose (18). Practically insoluble in both water and aqueous alcoholic solutions, MCC was the filler least likely to be affected by the dissolution media choice in this study. The effect of hydro-alcoholic media on swelling of pure PEO compacts. Mechanically strong compacts (i.e., >21 \u00b10.5 kp, > 3.3 MPa) were produced for all three grades of PEO tested in this study. In water and hydro-alcoholic solutions all PEO tablets underwent swelling and gelation without any disruption to the matrix integrity. A similar progressive weight gain by compacts made of various viscosity grades of PEO was observed in water and hydro-alcoholic media (see Figure 3 and Table VI). For high viscosity grades of PEO (e.g., Polyox 301 and Coagulant), a slightly lower swelling and gel formation in the presence of ethanol was recorded. This result can be attributed to a decrease in polymer solubility in alcohol compared with water (see Table III), retarded hydration of the polymer, and the resulting change in gel viscosity (29, 31, 50-51). Table VII shows that the extent of swelling increased with increasing molecular weight (MW) of PEO from 900,000 Da (Polyox 1105) to 4,000,000 Da (Polyox 301). However, no significant difference in compact relative swelling was observed when MW was further increased from 4,000,000 Da (Polyox 301) to 5,000,000 Da (Polyox Coagulant). Conclusion PEO tablets of the practically water insoluble drug gliclazide (30 mg) and freely soluble metformin HCl (500 mg) retained their hydrated structural integrity when exposed to 5% and 40% w/v ethanol solutions for up to 12 h. The matrices did not fail in hydro-alcoholic media. Small differences in drug release profiles were explained in terms of drug solubility in various media. The results of this study identified trends similar to those in previously published data for HPMC ER matrix systems. Exposure of compacts of three different viscosity grades of PEO (Polyox 1105, 301, and Coagulant) to water or hydro-alcoholic solutions had shown gradual swelling and gelation without any disruption to the tablet integrity. The Table VI: Effect of hydro-alcoholic media on wet weight of Polyox compacts ( n = 3). Time (min)Weight (mg) on relative swelling of Polyox compacts ( n = 3). Relative swelling Polyox 1105 4.2458 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 PharmTech.comcompact wet weight appeared to be only slightly lower in hydro-alcoholic solutions compared to water. The extent of their relative swelling was found to increase with increasing molecular weight of PEO from 900,000 Da to 5,000,000 Da. No significant difference in compact relative swelling was observed when MW increased further from 4,000,000 Da (Polyox 301) to 5,000,000 Da (Polyox Coagulant). This study clearly indicates that PEO matrices produces consistent drug release in water and in hydro-alcoholic media with no signs of a potential dose dumping. References 1. M. Levina and A.R.

The current review describes the role and selection of excipients, pellet core, coating materials, and compression with various cushioning agents. MUPS technology enables firms to achieve the desired and therapeutic release with minimal side effects. Thus, MUPS can open a new area of research for scientists with many opportunities for the formulation of controlled- and delayed-release oral dosage forms. Mitesh D. Phale* is a scientist and Abhijit V. Gothoskar is a global technical manager, both at Divakar Chemicals, 203-204, Sant Bhavan, India, phalemitesh@gmail.com. *To whom all correspondence should be addressed.Controlled Release Oral drug-delivery systems are the most acceptable form of controlled-release system to patients. Scien- tists have shown growing interest in modified-release oral dosage forms in recent years. Current technolo- gies, such as oral multiparticulate drug-delivery systems (MDDS), have gained immensely in importance, not only because of their ability to control drug release, but also for the modified drug-release profiles they facilitate. These systems release the drug with constant or variable release rates, thus maintaining drug concentration within the therapeutic window for a prolonged period of time. The desired release profile facilitates controlled absorption through the target site in the body, ensures good therapeu- tic activity, and reduces side effects (1). MDDS comprises a large number of small discrete particles (i.e., active in- gredient and excipients), each demonstrating desirable fea- tures. They are prepared by methods including extrusion- spheronization, pelletization, granulation, spray drying, and spray congealing. Multiunit systems Multiunit particulate systems (MUPS) are a novel MDDS technique for controlled and modified drug delivery. MUPS offer various advantages over other systems, including re- duced risk of local irritation and toxicity, predictable bio- availability, reduced likelihood of dose dumping, minimized fluctuations in plasma concentration of drug, and high dose-strength administration (1). Multiparticulate systems show more reproducible pharmacokinetic behavior and lower intra- and intersubject variability than conventional (i.e., monolithic) formulations (2). Tableting of pellets re- duces the esophageal residence time, compared with cap- sules, and improves physicochemical stability, compared with suspensions (2, 3). The applications for which MUPS formulations are de- veloped include taste masking (i.e., modified- or controlled-release orodispersible drugs for geriatric or pediatric patients. The technology of prepar-Multiunit Particulate Systems A Current Drug-Delivery Technology Mitesh D. Phale and Abhijit V. GothoskarPharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 61ing compacted MUPS ensures that the desired objectives (e.g., taste masking coupled with orodispersibility as well as modified-release characteristics) are effectively achieved. A good example of a MUPS is AstraZeneca's Losec, an antiulcer drug, the second-highest-selling pharmaceuti- cal product in Sweden in 2002 (3). The product consists of microencapsulated drug granules tableted with excipients (4). Other marketed MUPS include (Esomeprazole Sr) for erosive esophagitis, which are all manufactured by Hanmi Phar- maceutical. Challenges in the formulation of multiunit particulate systems Each discrete particle in a MUPS prod- uct incorporates its own release char- acteristics and further contributes to the product's therapeutic activity. Compressing these subunits with- out affecting their individual release profiles is a major challenge of MUPS technology because compacting sub- units may lead to structural changes in the coating and consequently alter drug-release behavior (5). Other challenges for manufactur- ing pellets in tablets (i.e., MUPS) are weight variation, poor hardness, and friability. To prevent subunits from being altered, formula- tors include a cushioning agent (i.e., an excipient with pro- tective properties) in the tablet formulation. The compression-induced changes in the structure of the subunits may depend on numerous formulation factors, such as the type and amount of coating, the properties and structure of the substrate pellets, and the incorporation of excipient particles. During MUPS formulation, scientists must consider process variables such as the nature of the polymer; the shape, porosity, and density of pellets; com- pression force and content of coated pellets in the tableting blend; the wall thickness of coating; and the nature of the excipients. Pelletization and multiunit particulate systems Pellets are manufactured by both wet and dry granulation techniques or by layering. Extrusion-spheronization is a wet-granulation technique that helps in the preparation of pellets or spherical agglomerates. The process involves a blending stage, in which active ingredients are blended with excipients and mixed with suitable binding solutions to form a heavy plastic mass. This mass is subjected to extrusion to form extrudates of equal length. After extrusion, the materi- als undergo a spheronizing stage that rounds extrudates by cutting them and rolling them into spheres (see Figure 1).Manufacturers create modified-release systems in two main ways. They either coat spherical, uncoated pellets or embed a drug in a polymer matrix system (6). The uncoated drug-polymer pellets prepared by extrusion-spheronization are subjected to compression into tablets (see Figure 2). In another technique, the polymer or release-controlling mate- rial is coated along with the drug onto the uncoated pellet to form a nonpareil seed (see Figure 3). These drug-polymer coated pellets are compressed into tablets to obtain MUPS. Compressibility and compactibility The ability of a powder to decrease in volume under pressure is called compressibility, and the ability of the powdered material to be compressed into a tablet of specific strength is called compactability (7). According to one theory, the compaction sequence for elastic materials includes particle rearrangement, plastic deformation, and elastic deformation (8). In Van der Zwan and Siskens's theory of the compac- tion of pellets, the process of volume reduction involves the filling of interparticle voids, where the secondary particles undergo readjustment; the fragmentation and plastic defor- mation of secondary particles; the filling of intraparticular voids, where primary particles rearrange, making the mass more dense; and the fragmentation and plastic deformation of the primary particles (9).

Figure 2: Pelletized tablet with drug embedded polymer matrix system. all fIGuRES aRE CouRTESy of ThE auThoRSFigure 3: Pelletized tablet with polymer coated pellets. 62 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 PharmTech.comIn an entirely different theory of compaction and vol- ume reduction, Johansson stated that the secondary par- ticles rearrange to fill interparticle voids where the strength of the compressed powder is too low due to low bonding force. Next, the surfaces of the secondary particles are flattened with local deformation. Then, as secondary particles undergo bulk deformation, they simultaneously become densely packed, and bonding strength increases significantly. Finally, low inter- and intragranular poros- ity causes the compression process to stop with less volume reduction of the bed but with higher bonding within the particles (10). The major challenge of a formulator is to retain pellet- properties after the compaction process. To aid formulators, this article will describe the factors involved in the compac- tion and consolidation of coated and uncoated pellets. Compression of coated pellets Preparing compacted MUPS (i.e., compressing coated pel- lets to achieve multiple objectives) is a challenging task. During compaction, the polymeric coating may not with- stand the compression force, thus affecting the surface of polymer and the pellets, which could cause the drug to be released in an undesired manner. Hence, thorough process optimization is needed for the compaction of coated pellets. The main variables involved are the compression force and the velocity of the punches. The hardness, thickness, and porosity of the tablets must be maintained. Other important factors concerning the prepa- ration of multiunit tablets are the properties of the barrier coating and the inclusion of protective excipient particles in the tablet formulation, and these parameters have been investigated extensively. Pellet core. Many formulators have successfully studied and investigated the compression behavior of pellets con- sisting of various excipients. The selection and study of the material used to manufacture pellets is important to achieve the desired release pattern (11). The comparison between soft and hard pellets revealed that the pellets with soft con- stituents had the greater chance that intergranular pore spaces would be filled because the primary particles can move within the agglomerate. Harder pellets tend to fail at the surface because of the pressure of compaction. Nicklasson studied the behavior of microcrystalline cel- lulose (MCC), alone and in combination with polyethylene glycol and dicalcium phosphate pellets, during and after compression. He concluded that pellets are deformed after compression, depending on their capacity for, mode of, and resistance to deformation. Nicklasson also studied polyeth- ylene glycol as a cushioning agent to analyze the compres- sion behavior of pellets. For the study, he used MCC-based beads loaded with theophylline, which are hard, and softer beads prepared with glyceryl monostearate (12). Wang attempted to study the compression of lactose and MCC in various concentrations of powder and pellets. MCC-based pellets lost their plasticity during granulation and hence showed poor compactability, compared with lac- tose-based pellets (13). Iloanusi and Schwartz studied the crucial role that plastic deformation plays in compression by adding wax to the MCC bead formulations. Pellets with wax as a cushioning agent had more compressibility than beads without wax as a compression modifier (14). Salako confirmed the advantages of softening materials during compression. On application of initial compaction pressure, the soft beads ruptured. On further application of pressure, the beads deformed and formed a network. Be- cause of the soft nature of the beads, the material readily underwent deformation and rearrangement. Harder pel- lets are compact, and upon the application of compaction pressure, they underwent reduction in volume by particle rearrangement, not because of bond formation, compared with soft pellets (15). Salako conducted a similar study of pellets' deformability and tensile strength using MCC-based beads loaded with theophylline, which are hard. Soft pellets were prepared with glyceryl monostearate (15). Pellets undergo structural modifications during com- paction. They need elasticity and flexibility to withstand compaction pressure. The ideal pellets are strong, not brit- tle, and have a low elastic resilience. They should deform under load application and load recovery without fracture (16). Knowledge of the compression behavior of uncoated pellets can provide a basis for the manufacture of multiunit tablets from barrier-coated pellets without damaging their coating. Size and shape. Pellets undergo deformation after compres- sion. Hence, the size of the pellets affects their compaction properties and the drug release from compacted pellets. Large pellets tend to undergo deformation more readily than small ones. Small pellets are stronger than large ones; they withstand compression pressure with less deformation (17). The strength of the pellets affects the final strength of the compressed tablet and helps ensure the desired release rate. Johansson proposed that the deformation of individual pellets could be correlated with their size. A higher degree of deformation was observed with large pellets than with small pellets. As the size of pellets increased, the number of force-transmission decreased, which increased the contact force on each pellet (18). Isometric-shaped pellets offered fewer contact points and more uniform drug release than anisometric-shaped particles. In addition to size, the shape of pellets affects the com- pression behavior and tablet-forming ability of granular materials. Irregular shapes induce complex compression behavior in granules. They increase the attrition of the granules, thus resulting in increased deformation (19-20). Flament found that, after the application of similar quanti- ties of coating on pellets, small pellets were more fragile than large pellets. The probable reason is that small pellets' Controlled ReleaseREGULATORY, CLINICAL, AND ANALYTICAL CHALLENGES IN DRUG DEVELOPMENT Join moderator Susan J.

Furthermore, increases in particle size resulted in more damage to the coating, as indicated by larger differences between the release profiles of tablets and uncompressed pellets (20). Beckert compacted coated pellets of two crushing strengths with different excipients and concluded that the harder pellets were better able to withstand compression forces because they deformed to a lesser degree and their film coatings were less susceptible to rupture (22). Ragnars- son found that the compaction of small pellets had less effect on drug release than the compaction of large pellets. He also concluded, however, that the effect of pellet size depended on the choice of coating material, as well as on the amount and properties of the pellets and the excipients forming the tablet (23). Density and porosity. Pellet density and size play an impor- tant role in achieving content and weight uniformity. Be- cause of their intragranular porosity, pellets tend to densify. By modifying their intragranular manufacturers can deform and densify pellets during compression (24-27). Pellets with a narrow size distribution and excipients of similar sizes, shapes, and densities can prevent segregation (28). The critical density for achieving prolonged gastric res- idence may be between 2.4 and 2.8 g/cm3 (29). The amount and choice of material used for binding or granulating the powders during pelletization, and the compaction pressure, have a direct effect on the porosity. Unlubricated pellets also require higher pressures than lubricated pellets (5). A study by Bodmeier revealed that an increased proportion of water as granulating fluid in the mixture led to hard and less porous tablets with a slow drug-release pattern. Similarly, pellets prepared using 95% ethanol as a granulating fluid showed good compressibility in contrast with pellets prepared with water (5). Using 95% ethanol during granulation formed strong intergranular bonds with an increased porosity, which finally increased the deformation of the formed pellets during compaction into tablets. Porosity also can affect drug release. Tuton showed that pellets of high porosity were densely packed and deformed, and that the drug release from these pellets was not affected. But upon compaction of pellets with low porosity, the pel- lets were compressed with slight densification and deforma- tion, leading to increased drug release. Using highly porous pellets did not alter the drug release after compression, in comparison with pellets with low porosity (30). Compression force. Compression force is a critical parameter that must be optimized during tableting of pellets. Several studies investigated the compression force required for com- pressing pellets and found that 15 KN was sufficient for tab- lets with smooth surfaces. Flament studied the compression of theophylline-loaded pellets with acrylic polymer. Upon the application of compression pressure, the pellets were compacted by deformation at 6 KN. Further investigation revealed that increasing the compaction force to 20 KN did not alter the dissolution rate significantly (21). Protective particles. Protective particles, also known as cushioning agents, help prevent damage to the drug- polymer-loaded core pellets. Protective particles rearrange themselves between the pellets and reduce the void space to prevent direct contact of pellets after the application of compression pressure. Preferred excipients are agglomerates (e.g., pellets or granules) that lower the risk that pellets will separate by size or density during processing, thus leading to weight variation or dose nonuniformity. When used as cushioning agents, primary particles (e.g., powder) give rise to the above problems (16, 21, 31). The cushioning effect of an excipient depends on its particle size, volume, and com- paction properties. The method by which the particles un- dergo volume reduction needs to be studied. Several studies proved MCC and polyethylene glycol to be good excipients for compaction because of their plastic deformation (22, 32-34). Studies also proved that lactose, which undergoes fragmentation upon compression, offers better protection than MCC (35). However, studies of 14 excipients proved that excipients that show good plastic deformation during compression give the best protection to the coating material (36). Particle size is an important factor in preformulation, and some studies suggested that particles smaller than 20 m prevent dam- age to the coating. Increased dissolution rate was observed with particles bigger than 20 m (29, 37). Using wax as a cushioning agent during pellet compression also is of great help to the formulator because it prevents damage to the coating during compression (38). Nature of polymer. Polymers play an important part in any controlled- or modified-release dosage form. The final release of the drug from the formulation depends on the polymer used. A polymer must have appropriate plastic and elastic properties to withstand the shear of compression and compaction. Various polymers currently used to modify the release of pellets are either cellulosic polymers (e.g., ethyl cellulose) BASF's Kollicoat). The frequently used polymers to extend the release of water-insoluble drugs are ethyl cellulose and ammonio methacrylate copolymers (39). Film-forming polymers have satisfactory elastic properties that prevent the rupture of the coating polymer, and good plastic properties that prevent deformation during compres- sion. Studies revealed that not only does the coating mate- rial affect compression properties, but also the solution in which polymer is dispersed or dissolved. The process en- tails dispersing polymer in water as pseudolatex or dissol- ving the polymer in an organic solvent. Investigations were conducted on ethyl cellulose to study its sustained-release properties after coating and compression in tablets. Ethyl cellulose improved pellets' puncture strength and elonga- tion by making them brittle. The mechanical properties of Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 65ethyl cellulose were less affected after it was plasticized with pseudolatexes (19). Beads composed of alternating layers of ethyl cellulose, drug, and cushioning agent are less brittle than those that include only drug and ethyl cellulose. Chang and Rudnic found that the solvent-based coatings were affected less by compression than the aqueous-based coatings were. Solvent-based coatings improved flexibility and mechanical stability in comparison with aqueous-based coatings (40). The coated pellets ruptured on compression, which affects the film formed on the pellets' surface. To minimize or overcome rupture during compression, Bodmeier suggested placing the compressed pellets in a hot- air oven above their glass-transition temperature (5). The brittle and elastic properties of MCC pellets were modified by applying a water-based ethyl cellulose coating to them. Thus, plastoelastic properties were introduced to the pellets after coating, which improved their deformation character- istics (31). Bechard and Celik showed that aqueous dispersions of ethyl cellulose for compression into multiunit tablets can, however, lead to coating failure through the formation of cracks and flaws (31-32). Films formed with high elasticity and apparent Newtonian viscosity delivered the maximum protection to the pellet core and coating on compaction (16). Lehmann suggested that the coating should be elongated at least 75% at the break to prevent the coating from rupturing during compression (41). Thickness of polymer coating. The amount of coating affects how much compaction can modify it. Applying a thick poly- meric coating to the surface of pellets imparts good elas- ticity and crushing strength to them (22). Damage to the coated pellets thus can be minimized during compression by applying a thick, rather than thin, coating of polymer solution (21-22). Bodmeier observed increased elastic and plastic deformation upon application of thick coating (5). The thickness of applied coatings provides good resistance to frictional forces, thus showing a direct dependence of cracks and elasticity on the film. To prevent the coatings from rupturing during compaction, the coating should have good elasticity and flexibility and be able to undergo struc- tural changes and adapt to the deformation process (16, 22, 40, 41). Plasticizer. Plasticizers are added to polymeric disper- sions, especially to water-dispersions, to lower their glass- transition temperature and expedite the coalescence of the distinct polymer particles in the dispersion. Thus, coales- cence of polymer particles directly relies on the time and temperature of coating and postcoating processes. Onions proposed a two-stage theory for the process of coalescence of aqueous polymeric dispersions. The first stage includes the evaporation of the aqueous layer and the formation of a dry, transparent, apparently continuous film on the surface of the coated material. The coalescence of distinct polymer particles is completed gradu- ally in the second stage. The water in the interstitial spaces starts evaporating slowly, bringing the separate particles close to each other and finally fusing the particles to form a strong and continuous film on the surface of the coated material (42-43). Further studies revealed that the amount of plasticizer did not influence drug release from compacted reservoir pellets (44). The flexibility of the aqueous-based coatings was improved by adding plasticizers, but Aulton ob- served that plasticizers led to a reduction in tensile strength (45). Felton proposed that increasing plasticizer content would increase the tensile strength of film-coated beads. The increased degree of plasticization of the polymer made the film more elastic and allowed it to withstand the deformation process during compression (46). Conclusion With its promising controlled-release mechanism for oral delivery, MUPS will be a focus of future research and devel- opment. The selection of excipients plays a key role in the success of MUPS. A thorough understanding of the factors that affect the performance of MUPS helps the formulator tailor the drug-release profiles. MUPS may soon become one of the most popular oral controlled-release systems. References 1. N.S. Dey, S. Majumdar, and M.E.B. Rao, Trop. J. Pharm. Res. 7 (3), (2008). 2. N. Follonier and E.

In collaboration with the International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council, the agency is asking for industry help in this effort. The authors describe the spectral-library project and address common questions. Lucinda F. Buhse is director of the Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis in FDA's Office of Testing and Research. Philip H. Merrell is a subcommittee chair at the International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council of the Americas and a technical market manager at Jost Chemical, tel. 314.428.4300. Position Paper: Supply-Chain Control Globalization of the pharmaceutical supply chain has increased the challenges to FDA to ensure that drug products and ingredients are not contaminated, coun- terfeited, or mislabeled (1, 2). To help in this effort, the agency has developed rapid screening methods for pharma- ceutical products and ingredients that can be deployed on portable instruments by field laboratories and inspectors for the screening of dietary supplements, pharmaceutical ingre- dients, and finished products on site (e.g., at border crossings, import centers, foreign manufacturing sites). Examples include detection of toxic and catalytic metals by X-ray fluorescence, detection of weight-loss drugs in dietary supplements by ion mobility spectroscopy, detection diethylene glycol near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy (3-7). The deployment of such instruments will allow FDA inspectors to screen a large number of ingredients and products at the site of importation, in domestic commerce, or even at foreign drug manufactur- ing sites, and to determine which are suspect and should be detained, sampled, and sent to laboratories for confirmatory testing by traditional methods such as US Pharmacopeial test- ing. FDA is concerned about diversion into the legitimate sup- ply chain of excipients that are unsuitable for use, as well as the possibility of tampering with an excipient during transit. During the past year, FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analy- sis (DPA) has developed a deeper understanding of the value and limitations of library-based Raman and NIR spectral-correlation methods for rapid spectroscopic screening of pharmaceutical in- gredients (8-10). The division has developed procedures for trans- ferring spectral libraries across instruments from different vendors and platforms (e.g., laboratory, portable, and handheld). DPA would now like to build an excipient library to be deployed on NIR and Raman portable instruments and used at points of entry or storage. To ensure a robust library, DPA is partnering with the International Pharmaceutical Excipients Council (IPEC) to reach out to manufacturers and distributors of common excipi- ents to provide authentic samples to the agency to help build these libraries. This article provides details on how to participate, and some anticipated questions and answers. Benefits of participation Development and deployment of an excipient library to monitor for possible contamination, adulteration, tamper- ing, and diversion into the qualified pharmaceutical supply FDA Introduces Spectral Libraries Lucinda F. Buhse and Philip H. Merrell68 Pharmaceutical Technology July 2011 PharmTech.comPosition Paper: Supply-Chain Control chain will improve safety of the drug supply, and thus, pa- tient safety. Additional benefits include the following: An inspector can make an immediate determination as to whether laboratory analysis is necessary by perform- ing a screening test. This approach would reduce delays associated with sending samples to a laboratory. Knowledge that FDA is screening excipients and that excipients are receiving a higher level of scrutiny should provide deterrence and add a layer of difficulty for any- one trying to infiltrate the supply chain. All parties can have an increased level of confidence that the material being identified is indeed from the qualified supplier. Materials that are different from the spectral reference standards can be flagged for additional investigation and, if warranted, subsequently added to the library. All parties will have increased assurance that goods were not tampered with, substituted, or otherwise fal- sified with regard to their origin during distribution. Screening and surveillance activities can enable rapid response to concerns of contamination, adulteration, and/or substitution in the supply chain reported to or identified by FDA. Creation of this library will provide added assurance that a given excipient is of the expected quality. Consumers will have increased confidence in the quality of drug products based on this increased surveillance of the excipient supply chain. Details of participation Materials (i.e, excipient samples) would be shared with DPA in St. Louis using a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA). This agreement would allow DPA to accept mate- rial from vendors and distributors and protect intellectual property. A copy of the MTA and contact information can be obtained on the FDA's Office of Testing and Research website under Hot Topics, at www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/ CentersOffices/CDER/ucm136930.htm. Manufacturers are asked to provide multiple lots (at least three) of approximately 2 g each of excipients with a Certificate of Analysis for the lot. In the case where manufacturers do not supply directly to the US pharmaceutical industry, distributors may submit the excipient samples. Material should be representa- tive of the potential spectral variability that might be expected in their product. Variables that might affect spectral variability would include the following: Manufacturing site Grade of material Expiration period Processing differences, including raw materials, operat- ing conditions, and production equipment Time of year of harvest. Samples should be accompanied by the following infor- mation where applicable: Name of manufacturer Manufacture site Excipient name Trade name Compendial or excipient grade Lot designation Date of manufacture Special handling or packaging requirements. Samples should conform to market standards and/or stan- dards filed with the agency. DPA is ready to begin receiving excipient samples for this project. Questions and answers The following section addresses anticipated questions about the spectral library project and the collection of samples. Answers are provided by the authors, representing DPA and IPEC. What instruments will be used for screening excipients? DPA plans to build two libraries, one for NIR and one for Raman spectroscopy. These are both common techniques used in library searches because their spectral features are highly sensitive to chemical structure. Both have become increasingly common in portable instrumentation due to their ability to sample through various common sampling media. Some excipients may not be suitable for both libraries because of some inherent limitations of each technique that must be taken into account when populating spectral librar- ies. An NIR spectrum is dependent on moisture content and particle size, for example. It contains broad and gener- ally weak spectral features (due to sampling of overtone and combination bands). Raman features tend to be sharper and do not depend on moisture or particle size, but if a sample fluoresces, Raman spectral features can be obscured and limit the effectiveness of the library method. Some of the limitations for these two techniques can be reduced using common preprocessing techniques, such as multiplicative scatter correction or first derivative preprocessing. The results of library searches are strongly dependent on (and often enhanced by) spectral preprocessing. How will a sample spectrum be matched to the libraries? The typical library search consists of correlating the full spectrum of a test (unknown) sample to a reference (library) spectrum using the Hit Quality Index (HQI), shown in the following equation: HQI = (Library \u00d7 Unknown)2 (Library \u00d7 Library) (Unknown \u00d7 Unknown) where the \u00d7 indicates the scalar product of the two vectors. As such, library searches are aimed at gauging the full spec- trum correlation of two spectra as opposed to focusing on a particular region or peak. The HQI values in the above equa- tion range from 0 to 1.000, with 1.000 indicating a perfect match. This match is achieved when the unknown spectrum is identical to the library spectrum. FDA plans to use this concept when it implements its libraries.October 23-27, 2011 Walter E. Washington Convention Center, Washington, DC, USA www.aapspharmaceutica.com/annualmeeting2011 AAPS Annual Meeting and ExpositionMark Your Calendars!70 Pharmaceutical Technology July 2011 PharmTech.comHow many materials are expected to be in the library? DPA has identified 166 excipients that fit in one or more of the following categories: most commonly used, most vulner- able to adulteration, or needing an update of the US Pharma- copeia monograph. From this list, FDA has narrowed down a priority list of excipients (see Table I). Once library entries for these priority materials have been obtained, the library will be deployed to field inspectors along with any other excipients that have been received. The library will continue to be expanded as additional excipients are received. What additional types of data are being considered for this library? Both an NIR and Raman library will be built. These libraries will contain the spectrum of each excipient. In addition to the spectrum, each entry will contain the chemical name, date added, and spectrometer details. When the library search algorithm can distinguish between different manu- facturers and/or sites of manufacture of the same excipient, such further identifying information will be included. Will the library be available to everyone? The agency does not plan to share the library at this time. If industry and the agency see value in sharing the library in the future, FDA will conform to any provisions in the MTAs. Will others be able to contribute to the spectral library? FDA prefers to obtain excipients directly from manufactur- ers or distributors to be certain of their identity and prov- enance of the manufacturer and/or manufacturing site to minimize the possibility that a contaminated or subpar quality excipient is included in the library. As far as con- tributing spectral entries into the spectral database, FDA will not be accepting spectra. How will the materials be used and/or evaluated? Both Raman and NIR spectra of the excipients received will be generated without further testing or qualification of the material. As the scope of this effort is to establish a spectral li- brary database, FDA does not plan to perform quality testing. Would there be a time factor for the samples (i.e., would the manufacturer need to send samples every year)? For most samples, this step would not be required. However, manufacturers could send new samples if they felt a process or raw material change could affect the spectrum of their material.

Presented by72 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 PharmTech.comThe Pharmaceutical Quality Research Institute Manufacturing Technology Committee (PQRI-MTC) commissioned a risk-management working group to assemble industry case studies for the purpose of advancing the understanding and application of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Q9 Guideline on quality risk management. The working group was comprised of eight representatives from industry and FDA with risk-management experience and expertise. This paper represents the outcome of the PQRI working group and provides a summary of common risk-management principles and best practices, decision-making tools to foster consistency around the use of ICH Q9, and case-study examples of risk-management applications currently in use by major pharmaceutical firms. The first of eight case studies is included with this overview article. The remainder of the case studies will appear in future issues of Pharmaceutical Technology .

It is a landmark docu- ment in acknowledging risk management as a standard and acceptable quality system practice to facilitate good decision- making with regard to risk identification, resource prioriti- zation, and risk mitigation/elimination, as appropriate. Recognizing the need to propagate and expedite holistic adoption of quality risk management across the pharmaceu- tical industry, the Pharmaceutical Quality Research Insti- tute Manufacturing Technology Committee (PQRI-MTC) commissioned a small working group of industry and FDA representatives to seek out good case studies of actual risk- management practices used by large bio/pharmaceutical firms to share with the industry at large. The working group spent approximately one year solicit- ing risk-management case studies from industry peers and contacts, and ultimately reviewed more than 20 of them. Each study was graded against six multiple criteria to assess applicability, usefulness, and alignment with ICH Q9. The highest graded case studies were measured against two addi- tional criteria to ensure a balanced mix of examples for this report. Due to the size of a well-developed risk assessment, especially when applied to a complex problem or operating area, the presented case studies in most instances represent redacted versions of the actual assessments. Nonetheless, the provided summaries are effective in demonstrating the general thought process, risk application, and use of chosen risk methods. As a byproduct of the working group's collaboration on risk-management practices, several common principles that reflect current industry and regulatory thinking emerged. These principles are aligned with, and in some instances expand beyond, those defined by ICH Q9 and are included in this report. In addition, several risk-management refer- ence tools used by participating firms have been included as examples.Quality Risk Management Principles and Industry Case Studies Ted Frank, Stephen Brooks, Kristin Murray, Steve Reich, Ed Sanchez, Brian Hasselbalch, Kwame Obeng, and Richard CreekmorePharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 73Scope Risk-management principles, case studies, and support- ing tools used by large bio/pharmaceutical manufacturers for effective quality oversight of product development and manufacturing operations are included in this report. Each case study notes the applicable corresponding quality system (i.e., Quality, Facilities & Engineering, Material, Production, Packaging & Labeling, or Laboratory Control) that is con- sistent with FDA's quality systems guidance document (3). In addition, the case studies identify the risk methodology that was used for ease of categorization, understanding, and potential application by the reader. Medical-device examples fall beyond the scope of this article, although the case stud- ies and tools presented have relevance to device manufac- turing. See the sidebar, \"PQRI case studies,\" for details on the topics covered.Principles and common practices Core principles of quality risk management according to the ICH Q9 guideline include the following: 1. Compliance with applicable laws: Risk assessment should be used to assess how to ensure compliance and to de- termine the resulting prioritization for action\u2014not for a decision regarding the need to fulfill applicable regula- tions or legal requirements. 2. Risk can only be effectively managed when it is identi- fied, assessed, considered for further mitigation, and communicated. This principle embodies the four stages of an effective quality risk-management process as de- fined by ICH Q9: risk assessment (i.e., risk identifica- tion, analysis, and evaluation); risk control (i.e., risk reduction and acceptance); risk communication; and risk review.Table I: Common risk-management 2011 PharmTech.com3. All quality risk evaluations must be based on scientific and process-specific knowledge and ultimately linked primarily to the protection of the patient. Risk assess- ment is based on the strong understanding of the un- derlying science, applicable regulations, and related pro- cesses involved with the risk under analysis. Collectively, these components should be assessed first and foremost with regard to the potential impact to the patient (see Figure 1). 4. Effective risk management requires a sufficient under- standing of the business, the potential impact of the risk, and ownership of the results of any risk-management assessment. 5. Risk assessment must take into account the probability of a negative event in combination with the severity of that event. This principle also serves as a useful working definition for risk (i.e., risk represents the combination of the probability and severity of any given event). 6. It is not necessary or appropriate to always use a for- mal risk-management process (e.g., standardized tools). Rather, the use of an informal risk-management process (e.g., empirical assessment) is acceptable for areas that PQRI Case Studies Table II: Severity categorization. Category Severity of Consequences Patient Safety Regulatory Compliance Product Supply Other 5 - Figure 1: Quality risk-evaluation pyramid. Figure 2: Documentation level. 76 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 PharmTech.comPQRI Case Studies are less complex and that have lower potential risk. Risk decisions are made by industry every day. The complex- ity of the events surrounding each decision and the po- tential risk involved are important inputs in determining the appropriate risk-assessment methodology and cor- responding level of analysis required. For less complex, less risky decisions, a qualitative analysis (e.g., decision tree) of the options may be all that is required. In gen- eral, as the complexity and/or risk increases, so should the sophistication of the risk-assessment tool used. In the same regard, the level of documentation of the risk- management process to render an appropriate risk as- sessment should be commensurate with the level of risk (2). See Figure 2 for details.Risk-assessment supporting tools A key early step in the execution of a risk analysis is to deter- mine the appropriate risk-assessment tool, or methodology. There is no single best choice for any given assessment pro- cess, and the selection of the appropriate risk methodology should be based on the depth of analysis required, complexity of the subject risk of concern, and the familiarity with the as- sessment tool. Based on the industry examples reviewed by the PQRI-MTC working group, risk ranking and filtering (sometimes referred to as risk matrix) and flowcharting were the most popular tools used for basic risk-assessment activi- ties. Correspondingly, failure-mode effect analysis (FMEA) appeared to be the most frequently used methodology for more advanced risk analysis. Some examples demonstrated Continued on 79 The Pharmaceutical Quality Research Institute Manufacturing Technology Committee (PQRI-MTC) selected eight industry case studies that best embody the intent and principles of the International Conference on Harmonization Q9 Quality Risk Management guideline to share with industry. These examples address real-life issues, are straightforward in their application, and are designed to engender a general understanding and appreciation of the usefulness of risk-management applications in routine decision-making opportunities. Given size and complexity of the assessments, the case studies have been redacted, but still provide sufficient information to demonstrate the concept, application, and use of the fundamental risk principles used. The authors have attempted to include case studies that represent approaches that appear to be consistent with cGMPs. The content and decisions made by each risk assessment exercise represent the opinions of the authoring firm. The risk -assessment case studies are summarized below. Each case study notes the corresponding quality system (i.e., Quality, Facilities & Engineering, Material, Production, Packaging & Labeling, or Laboratory Control). Each system is consistent with FDA's quality systems guidance (3). In addition, the risk methodology used is identified. Case Study 1: Defining Process Space. System: Other (product development).

Each case study is organized according to the following general sequence: Background. A brief summary is provided of the area of required risk assessment. Risk question. The first step in the quality risk management (QRM) process is to develop and agree upon the risk question. In the development of the question, it is important to first consider whether there is any potential impact of the proposed actions to the patient. Evaluation of risks, when applicable, should ultimately be linked to the protection of the patient. Clearly defining the risk question facilitates selection of the appropriate tool, identifies relevant data, information and assumptions, assists in the identification of resources, responsibilities and accountabilities, and ensures that appropriate focus on the business objective is maintained. Risk-assessment method. The selected risk-assessment method or tool will be used to organize data and explain what steps can be taken to reduce or control risk, and thereby, help to make appropriate decisions. In the selection of a risk tool, it is recommended that the user evaluate the QRM process and select the simplest tool available to support the process. Risk assessment (identification, analysis, and evalution). The objective of risk identification is to develop a comprehensive analysis to include all applicable operations. At this stage of the QRM process, care should be taken not to exclude operations that may be perceived as having low risk, without fully evaluating the actual and associated potential influences and risks involved. The risk-analysis stage estimates the potential harm(s) associated with each potential risk. The analysis may be qualitative or quantitative in nature, or a combination of the two. Risk control . During the risk-control stage of the QRM process, a decision is made on which risks, if any, require mitigation. Necessary actions are taken to reduce or avoid all prioritized risks, as appropriate and practical. Risk documentation and communication. Communication of the QRM process should integrate key stakeholders. Ensuring that key stakeholders are engaged in the data-collection and decision-making processes maximizes the probability of organizational buy-in and support. The output of the process and associated risk analysis justifying the approach should be documented and endorsed by the site quality unit. Additionally, this information should be communicated to stakeholders for their information and to ensure their support. Risk review. Appropriate systems should be put in place to ensure that the output of the QRM process is periodically reviewed, as appropriate, to assess new information that may impact the original risk-management decision. Examples of changes that may affect risk of site operational systems include: changes to control systems, changes to equipment and processes, changes in suppliers, and organizational restructuring. The first case study appears on the following pages. The remaining case studies will appear in the next several issues of Pharmaceutical Technology.

The series is meant to advance the understanding and application of the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Q9 Quality Risk Management guideline by providing actual examples of risk-management assessments used by the bio/pharmceutical industry. The introductory article appears on page 72 of this issue. The remainder of the case studies will appear in future issues of Pharmaceutical Technology . Risk assessment of the manufacturing process is a key ac- tivity in product development, especially as a supportive tool in quality by design (QbD). In this case study, a drug product was formulated with different variants, each with a different dissolution profile ranging from slow to fast. While an in vitro-in vivo correlation (IVIVC) evaluation was not possible due to product-specific pharmacokinetic factors, the profiles of all of the formulations were similar. The dissolution method was already known to be over-discriminatory and the slowest dissolu- tion profile from the range of formulation variant studies was set as the slowest dissolution profile acceptable. This profile would serve as the surrogate test for the quality of the clinical product in processing studies. In other words, the design space for clinical quality would be a product with a faster dissolution profile than the slowest variant. To ensure a full understanding of all potential influences to the design space, a full risk assessment of the manu- facturing process was conducted to ensure that areas of greatest risk were appropriately considered and controlled. Risk question and risk-assessment method The risk question developed for the subject case study is: What are the critical input and processing variables for the product that would affect the product quality based on the design space? A manufacturing process for a drug product usually consists of many steps, each with potentially multiple variables requiring evaluation. The selected risk-assessment method must produce a quantitative output that describes the level of risk relative to other risks being assessed. As an aid to a likely complicated risk assess- ment effort, the resulting data should also be organized in such a way that that a simple visual summary can be produced. Failure- mode effect analysis (FMEA) was selected for this case study. Risk identification The risk-assessment team assigned to this initiative first prepared a list of all operations and associated supporting systems that had potential impact on product quality. During this stage of the qual- ity risk management (QRM) process, no processes were excluded simply because the process was perceived as \"low risk\" (see Table I).Defining Process Design Space A Risk-Management Case Study (Part 1) Ted Frank, Stephen Brooks, Kristin Murray, Steve Reich, Ed Sanchez, Brian Hasselbalch, Kwame Obeng, and Richard Creekmore78 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 PharmTech.comTable I: Quality risk management output.

Risk analysis and evaluation The risk-analysis stage of the QRM process estimates the potential harm(s) associated with each potential risk. The analysis may be qualitative or quantitative in nature, or a combination of the two. In this case study, the analysis used was quantitative. The risk score or risk product number (RPN) was determined by multiply- ing the scores for probability, severity, and detectability, as shown in the following equation: RPN = probability score \u00d7 severity score \u00d7 detectability score where the ranking definitions for probability, severity, and detect- ability were developed prior to commencing any actual assessment (see Table II). After the risk areas were identified, subject-matter experts evaluated each risk area and listed corresponding failure modes and failure effects for each risk area. Subsequently, prob- ability, severity, and detectability were determined using the scor- ing criteria in Table II. The results were collated and reviewed to ensure consistency and accuracy. The final output was published for risk prioritization. Each line item from the assessment was ranked as either a low, intermediate, or high risk, depending on the calculated RPN value. A RPN of < 40 was considered a low risk; a RPN of 40-99 was identified as an intermediate risk; and a RPN of 100 was defined as a high risk. Risk rankings took into consideration the overall RPN value as well as how significant the issue under assessment was to the development of the product. In many cases, mitigating the larger RPN issues also resulted in a decrease in the calculated RPN for areas with lower identified risks. To facilitate understand- ing and management of the results defined by Table I, a color- coded chart was developed to correlate risk-assessment results to anticipated tablet quality, categorized by specific unit processes. By summarizing the results in this manner, the project team was able to see and communicate how the identified risks were inter-related and prioritized (by RPN) for risk mitigation. Risk control Assessed risks were reduced by identifying the unit operations or procedures where the RPN was calculated above a certain thresh- old and developing corresponding risk-mitigating strategies to lower the overall calculated risk level. This calculated RPN value was a relative number based on other assessed risks, and was devel- oped using a set of predefined definitions on severity, probability and detectability. After implementing mitigating actions to reduce the perceived high risk areas, the RPN values were recalculated to ensure that the projected risks were appropriately reduced.PQRI Case StudiesPharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 79Risk documentation and communication The risk analysis was reviewed by management and experts in QRM assigned to the project. The knowledge gained through this risk assessment was shared with the employees at the company's other development sites as well as externally through a series of presentations at industry forums. In addition, the lessons learned from this risk assessment have been incorporated into current development projects and will be institutionalized for future use. Risk review In following the company policy for quality and quality systems, a report describing the rationale, risk-assessment process, action plan, and conclusions were forwarded to the appropriate internal quality groups for future follow-up (e.g., audit, preapproval inspec- tion, risk analysis). To follow the feedback loop as recommended in ICH Q9, work was carried out to mitigate the risk of the items with high RPNs (e.g., action plan implementation). After this work was completed, the group reviewed the results of the mitigation actions and some batches manufactured after the risk assessment and convened a second quality risk assessment focusing on the areas with high RPNs. Other risk areas with initial lower RPN val- ues were also assessed to determine any additional impact (positive or negative) resulting from mitigating actions taken for the highest prioritized risk areas. The results of this follow-up were published in the same format as Table II and distributed to the stakeholders. A third review was carried out after the implementation of the risk mitigation actions discussed above. This third check, somewhat removed from the initial assessment and mitigating efforts, was performed to further ensure that the conclusions and actions from the risk assessment were correct.

For example, fault-tree analysis (FTA) or a fishbone diagram can be used to initially scope and evaluate the fault modes of a particular problem and be used to feed a hazards analysis and critical control point (HACCP), or a similar tool to evaluate overall system control and effectiveness can be used. Table I provides a list of generally well-recognized risk- management tools. Each risk subject and assessment warrants consideration of the applicable descriptors of potential risk and related conse- quences. Ideally, firms should establish a guidance document ahead of any risk analysis, such as the one provided in Table II, to help guide the risk-assessment process and provide for consistency in decision-making company-wide. Risk trainers. In assembling this collection of case studies, the authors recognized the benefit of providing industry with additional background on core risk methodologies. Training tools for the application of risk ranking and filter- ing, FMEA, FTA, and HAZOP are available online with the web version of this article at PharmTech.com/PQRIstudies. These tools are meant to facilitate greater familiarity with the risk methodology used in each corresponding case study. Conclusion The PQRI-MTC Risk Management Working Group solicited and formatted a series of best-practice case studies aligned with ICH Q9 principles. The collected case studies demon- strate that there is a wide range of applications for the use of structured risk-management analysis to facilitate effec- tive quality-decision activities. The studies demonstrate the baseline needed to choose the appropriate risk methodology for the targeted need, taking into account the degree of com- plexity and risk involved for the specific subject of concern. It is equally important to predefine the potential resulting risk categorizations so as to not be influenced by the assess- ment results in defining appropriate response actions. Finally, once risks have been appropriately assessed and prioritized, clear risk-mitigating actions must be defined, communicated, implemented and monitored for effectiveness. References 1.

PT80 Pharmaceutical Technology JULY 2011 PharmTech.comOUTSOURCING OUTLOOK JONATHAN EVANS/PHOTODISC/ GETTY IMAGES PharmTech.com/outsource For several years, Big Pharma has been cutting programs and reducing head- count as a result of mergers and ac- quisitions and overall cost-cutting efforts. According to industry estimates, approxi- mately 50,000 pharmaceutical industry employees lost their jobs in 2010, and 300,000 have been let go in the past 10 years (1). Many reasons are behind these cuts: a decline in traditional research and development productivity, tougher regula- tory hurdles, a plethora of government and formulary pricing controls, and significant patent expiry of major blockbuster drugs. Now, more than two years after the economic meltdown, the industry un- derstands that prosperity is not around the corner. What many call the \"New Normal,\" characterized by slower growth, tighter credit markets, a more conservative approach, less money available for invest- ment, and tighter financial regulations, has become the new operating reality. It doesn't have to be all doom and gloom, however. Even in the best-run or- ganizations, there is an untapped source of cash from what I like to call \"creating your own stimulus by buying items and services better.\" In many companies, the cost of purchased items and services (i.e., the money paid to suppliers) is equal to be- tween 30-70% of total company revenue. In the pharmaceutical industry, this cost is typically between 30 and 50%. What I've come to understand is that regard- less of how good or how bad a company is at buying products and services, there is still plenty of cash to extract from its costs. Three methods\u2014spend segmentation, bet- ter specifications, and online reverse mar- ketplaces\u2014can improve results. Spend segmentation. By not applying the appropriate sourcing strategy, a company may pay between 10% and as high as 70% more for products and services, based on my experience. This differential exists be- cause of the strategy or lack of strategy that is in place for a certain purchase. Figure 1 identifies four types of supplier relation- ships by such attributes as ease of buying, supply-market competitiveness, unique- ness, and strategic importance. A buyer's strategy needs to be in the right quadrant to ensure that a company is paying the right price, producing the right total cost, and getting the best value associated with a particular product or service. For example, if a company is making a purchase where the supplier maintains the power in the relationship (i.e., the \"critical\" quadrant), the buyer is paying an absolute premium. Typically, less than 10% of a company's spend will be desig- nated as \"critical,\" according to my expe- rience. Companies with poor purchasing practices, however, often allow suppliers to act as if they were a natural monopoly. A purchaser should review its spending to move supplier relationships from the \"criti- cal\" quadrant to \"strategic\" or better yet to \"leverage\" positions (see Figure 1). My experience suggests that on average, only 20% of spend is truly \"strategic,\" and most of what is purchased can be highly lever- aged among multiple suppliers. Better specifications . Many factors de- termine how much to pay for a good or service. In simple terms, supply is what is available, and demand is how much is being requested. Consumption is how much is being used at what rate, and spec- ification is what constitutes a product or service. The interactions of these variables are the main drivers of price paid. Offsetting Budget Cuts Better strategies and practices in sourcing and procurement can contribute to the bottom line.

A company's strategy af- fects its ability to pay less, to use less, to use something else, or not to use at all. Take a close look at specifications and carefully review the requirements. In many cases, a company will find individual requirements that are \"over spec'd\" or not needed at all, which lead to significant and unnecessary costs. Additionally, consumption can often be reduced by making the user community aware of the total costs involved and by pol- icies that control overall usage, particularly for indirect items and services. Online reverse marketplaces. Think about how a company buys. It is probably one of the following scenarios. The simplest is calling the supplier and accepting the price being quoted. Then there is the \"haggle\" method, same as the first method, but with some pressure applied to get a lower price. Then more sophistication with the \"competitive bid policy,\" in which the buyer typically gets three bids before making a se- lection. Another method is to do additional negotiation after getting the three bids, an interesting approach, but it still may fall short in securing the best possible terms. A reverse auction, a transparent and dynamic bidding model, is different. All sellers are bidding on the exact same item or service. When using this method, the buyer must have good specifications or requirement documents available to all sellers as opposed to the haphazard way requirements are given using some of the other traditional methods. Because the buying event has great transparency, sell- ers can see if their pricing leads or lags. The buyer does not have to select the low- est bidder and may weigh other factors in the purchasing decision. Reverse auctions drive pricing to what the market will bear at any given time against various seller in- dependent variables. Until recently, the technology required to conduct reverse auctions was costly, required considerable employee train- ing, and presented certain internal and some external barriers for implementa- tion. These barriers, however, are eroding. The premier reverse auction marketplace, FedBid, used by the federal government for 10 years, is now available for commercial use and offers a procurement model for commodity products and basic services. The marketplace has over 50,000 qualified suppliers. More than 50,000 \"buys\" were conducted in 2010 with savings ranging between 5 and greater than 50%. There is no cost to the buyer for using the tech- nology, which is web-browser-based. The winning seller pays a modest 3% transac- tion fee and is billed by the marketplace operator 60 days after the buying award is made. If the product is not currently in the marketplace, the marketplace operator will at, no charge, find the right sellers and even train a company's existing suppliers so they can compete on a regular basis in the marketplace. Reverse auctions can be good for buyers and sellers. Buyers save money, and sellers gain more opportunities to win business. Reserve auctions, along with the other sourcing practices discussed, are potential drivers for value creation. Reference 1. E.

We manufacture quality detergents made in the United States and pro- vide outstanding technical service to the scientists and engineers with precision cleaning needs. Where We Came From... The ALCONOX brand was intro- duced in 1941 for use in hospi- tals and laboratories as a hard surface cleaner that cleaned with- out interfering residues. This in- novative and desirable technology led to the rapid acceptance of ALCONOX, and to the formation of Alconox, Inc. in 1946. We have expanded continually increas- ing into new markets with new brands. The year 2011 marked our 65th year as a successful privately held corporation.The Benefits of Aqueous Critical Cleaning The benefits of employing aqueous cleaning in pharmaceutical manu- facturing are numerous. Virtually any pharmaceutical manufactur- ing equipment from tablet press to a stainless steel mixing tank can achieve their defined critically clean criteria using aqueous clean- ing. Typically aqueous cleaners are formulated to ensure maximal cleaning performance by using key ingredients such as surface active agents (surfactants) that are excel- lent wetting agents that allow the cleaning solution to penetrate into crevices while getting under soils to allow for removal. Often very di- lute solutions of aqueous cleaner effectively removes even worst case substances off a variety of hard surfaces including stainless steel, glass, plastic or porcelain.The Pharmaceutical Advantage With about 50 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry and technical knowledge at your fingertips. Alconox, Inc. is the logi- cal choice for your pharmaceutical cleaning and cleaning validation needs. We provide the detergents and industry information to be suc- cessful. See the table above for typical cleaning in the pharmaceu- tical industry.Alconox, Inc. www.alconox.com In general alkaline cleaners are preferable to acidic cleaners for pharmaceutical residues. However, for cleaning residues such as insoluble hydroxides, is recommended.

MTS delivers significant bene- fits compared to injections that for some drugs and vaccines may in- clude improved delivery efficiency, quicker onset of action and the po- tential to achieve similar efficacy using less drug. Additionally, MTS helps improve compliance through easy self-administration with mini- mal discomfort. With up to 0.3 mg capacity, the solid microneedle system (sMTS) utilizes 375-1300 solid micronee- dles per cm2, 150-700\u00b5m tall, each coated with drug or vaccine and integrated into a small, wearable device. 3M precision coating tech- nology is used to uniformly apply the drug or vaccine to the tips of the microstructures. Upon applica- tion, the microneedles penetrate the stratum corneum and remain there while the drug or vaccine is released from the microneedles and diffuses into the tissue. The device wear time is short, ranging from 30 seconds to 10 minutes. Because the drug or vaccine is in the dry state, sMTS has the poten- tial to enhance stability for some drugs, allowing room temperature storage. With up to 2 mL capacity, the hollow microneedle system (hMTS) utilizes 18 hollow microneedles per cm2, approximately 950\u00b5m tall, integrated into a small, wear- able device designed for efficient intradermal delivery of liquid for- mulations. Upon application, the microneedles penetrate the skin while small channels allow for fluid flow from the device into the skin, with wear time ranging from 2 to 20 minutes. hMTS is uniquely suited for high volume intradermal infu- sion and provides the potential for improved pharmacokinetics rela- tive to subcutaneous injection for a variety of drugs, including mono- clonal antibodies.3M Drug Delivery Systems www.3M.com/MTS (MTS) combine the ef ciency of a syringe with the convenience of a transdermal patch.

The great strength of DSC is that complex information can be quickly obtained about physical transitions, the structure of materials as well as the kinet- ics and composition of chemical reactions. Conventional DSC instruments perform measurements at heat- ing rates of up to 500 K/min and cooling rates of 200 K/min with a signal time constant of about 1 to 2 seconds. This is not adequate for the investigation of the struc- ture and morphology of polymers and polymorphic substances or of meta-stable materials in general. Different cooling rates can lead to changes in the meta-stable struc- ture when materials are cooled from the melt. This specific reor- ganization often cannot be mea- sured in the DSC because the result curve consists of exother- mic and endothermic events that take place simultaneously. A new technology is needed to further in- vestigate these systems, suppress decomposition and detect all pos- sible polymorphic structures. The Flash DSC 1 (Fig. 1) is a completely new type of commer- cial DSC with a signal time con- stant of less than 1 millisecond. This allows very high heating and cooling rates to be achieved in the range is 1 K/s to 40,000 K/s (60 K/ min to 2,400,000 K/min). The heat- ing rate overlap with conventional DSC is complimentary and offers over six decades of heating rate for experimentation. The UFS 1 Multi- STAR sensor is based on MEMS technology (MEMS: Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) and is made up of two separate calorimeters on a removable sensor chip (Fig. 2). It consists of two identical quadratic silicon nitride membranes with a thickness of 2 m. The sample area has a diameter of 0.5 mm and is coated with aluminium so that a homogeneous temperature profile is obtained. The temperature of this area is measured by means of eight thermocouples and resis- tive heaters are used to heat very quickly. Samples can be prepared and cycled many times to under- stand the effect of high heating and cooling rates, stored for archiving purposes and re-investigated again at a later date. Organic materials typically have a mass between 10 ng and 10 g and the mounted stereo microscope aids sample preparation and placement. The Flash DSC 1 opens the door to the wider experimental param- eters required to investigate the meta-stable and time-dependent transitions of materials. Very fast cooling and heating rates allow researchers to generate mate- rial under real process conditions (cooling) and then measure those material properties (heating) to gain a never before seen perspective into their materials.Mettler Toldeo www.mt.com/TA-FlashDSC Figure 1 Figure 2The Flash DSC 1 represents a giant leap in Thermal Analysis technology and revolutionizes fast-scanning Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Its incredibly high heating and cooling rates enable exploration of exciting new applications under exactly the same conditions that occur in your existing process. An ideal compliment to the conventional DSC, the Flash DSC 1 heats samples so quickly that recrystallization and reorganization processes can be supressed and studied \u2014 like walking on the moon, it was once thought impossible.

The department recognized the need for increased public investment and called for the creation of a Federal Initiative for Regenerative Medicine, similar to the semiconductor manufacturing tech- nology (SEMATECH) public-private consortium model that accelerated the growth of the semiconductor industry in the 1980s and 1990s (1). national strategy As the Obama administration touts its innovation strategy as a tool for promot- ing economic growth, the industry is also recognizing the need for a national strat- egy for regenerative medicine to sustain investment in this sector and raise the profile of regenerative medicine as one of America's fastest growing innovative industries. The Alliance for Regenera-tive Medicine has drafted a strategy that is supported by industry to rival bold initiatives that have been announced by China and other countries. The essential elements of the national strategy include: Creation of a coordinated plan among the various federal agencies overseeing regenerative-medicine programs and policies Development of incentives that will stimulate greater private in- vestment in regenerative medicine technologies and therapies Increased federal funding for regenerative-medicine research with a particular emphasis on pro- moting public-private partnerships A predictable regulatory review and approval process A reimbursement framework that will help companies plan for and communicate the commercial po- tential of their products. The Alliance developed this plan to provide a strategic framework that will complement the legislative proposals included in the Regenerative Medicine Promotion Act of 2011, which the US House of Representatives introduced as H.R. 1862 in May 2011. This legislation calls for the creation of a Regenera- tive Medicine Coordinating Council among federal government stakehold- ers, establishment of different fund- ing mechanisms for public-private research projects and preclinical work needed to file an investigatational new drug apppplication, and increased funding for regulatory science research at FDA. The Regenerative Medicine Promotion Act of 2011\u2014along with the national strategy\u2014are essential to US efforts to maintain international lead- ership in healthcare innovation. Reference 1. HHS, \"Future of Regenerative Medicine,\" (HHS, 2006), PharmTech.com/viewViewpoint DORLING KINDERSLEY/GETTY IMAGES Elizabeth West Regenerative medicine provides an ideal opportunity for public investment in an industry that will help the United States maintain its global technological leadership and fa- cilitate needed advances in healthcare. The industry is revolutionizing treat- ments of numerous chronic diseases, including diabetes, Parkinson's disease, ALS, heart failure, and different types of cancers, by focusing on using liv- ing cells to repair tissue and treat the underlying causes of disease. The po- tential of regenerative medicine to lead to disease-altering treatments for these conditions is real and, in some cases, may include the complete regeneration of damaged tissue and organs. Although full-organ replacement technology is likely decades away, dozens of innovative, entrepreneurial firms are advancing therapies in clini- cal trials for the treatment of costly diseases, such as critical limb ischemia, myocardial infarction, and spinal-cord injury, to name a few. Not only do these therapies represent an opportunity to drastically improve the current stan- dard of care, but they may also pro- vide billions of dollars in long-term cost savings for treatments of these chronic diseases. The potential sav- ings from regenerative medicine treat- ments for the US alone in terms of the direct costs associated with five preva- lent chronic diseases\u2014late-stage Par-kinson's disease, new cases of spinal- cord injury, heart failure, stroke, and insulin-dependent diabetes\u2014is ap- proximately $250 billion a year. Global support Other nations have also recognized the potential of regenerative medicine and are keen to grow their capabili- ties in this field. China's Ministry of Science and Technology, for example, allocated more than $290 million dol- lars for stem-cell research during the period 2006-2010. More than 75% of those funds are being used for prod- uct development. The government has prioritized stem-cell and regenerative- medicine research by placing approxi- mately 300 researchers in 30 institu- tions to focus on key strategic areas, including nerve injury and functional reconstruction of tissue. Japan, the United Kingdom, and Australia have national efforts targeting regenera- tive medicine and cell therapy priority areas in medical innovation as well. US strength Although international investment in regenerative medicine is intensifying, many research institutions and compa- nies leading the efforts to develop new therapies are based in the US. The in- frastructure required to manage these programs is significant and contrib- utes to job growth and investment that supports many regional economies. California has led the charge with the creation of the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) through a statewide ballot measure that provided $3 billion in funding for stem-cell research at California univer- sities, research institutions, and thera- peutic development companies. CIRM recently released economic impact data estimating that its first $1.1 billion in grants will create 25,000 jobs and $200 million in new tax revenue for California through 2014. Despite the promise of regenerative medicine in economic development and for improving the healthcare sys- tem, companies in this sector still face numerous challenges that are hinder- ing their ability to develop products for patients. These obstacles include insufficient funding for product de- velopment and clinical trials, an un- clear regulatory pathway for new tech- nologies, inconsistent reimbursement policies, and a general lack of aware- ness of the potential for regenerative medicine to help us address long-term healthcare costs. Although $4 billion has poured into this growing sector contin. on page 133US support of regenerative medicine is essential for maintaining a lead on healthcare innovation.Regenerative Medicine: the need for a national Strategy Elizabeth West is director of programs at the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine, ewest@ alliancerm.org.The potential to lead to disease- altering treatments is real.
