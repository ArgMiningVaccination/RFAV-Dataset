Article contents Counseling students' attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine integration in counseling practice Published online by Cambridge University Press: 21 October 2019 Abstract This study explored counseling students' attitudes toward beliefs and personal experience with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) integration in counseling practices. A total of 113 clinical mental health counseling students completed a demographic questionnaire, the CAM use, and the Complementary and Alternative Medicine Beliefs Inventory. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, nonparametric Chi-Square testing, Mann-Whitney U test, and logistic regression analysis to determine the prevalence of CAM use, CAM beliefs, and predictive factors of CAM integration. The results indicated differences in ethnicity, gender, and age for CAM use, CAM beliefs, and predictors of attitudes toward CAM integration. Recommendations for counseling practice and education regarding CAM use and community-based health promotion were discussed.
