Information Items: A. UNM's International Posture TAB Q Nicole Tami, Ph.D., Executive Director, Global Education Initiatives Global Education Office (GEO) GEO is a multi -functional service unit tasked with promoting and facilitating international education and engagement at UNM: Forge strategic partnerships and agreements with academic institutions & government partners around the globe. Act as a liaison for U.S. government agencies, foreign embassies, sponsors, and educational foundations that support international education Support UNM faculty to engage in virtual teaching collaborations and develop/lead courses abroad Recruiting and admitting interna tional students, includes foreign credential evaluation Intensive English as a Second Language (ESL) education Advise and facilitate education abroad for UNM students Provide immigration advice & manage institutional compliance for J -1 & F -1 visa holders Onboarding support and transition services for international students and visiting scholars Non-credit, high- impact, 2-8-week certificate programs tailored to academic level and organizational interests According to NAFSA (Association of International Educa tors) international students in New Mexico made a financial contribution of $59.6 million USD in 2021 and supported over 497 jobs. For international students at the University of New Mexico the total estimated expenditure is $30.4 million USD and 285 jobs supported. There has been an increase of international students at the graduate level GEO collaborates regularly with other campus entities that promote campus internationalization at various levels: Latin American & Iberian Institute International Studies Institute UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO BOARD OF REGENTS' STUDENT SUCCESS, TEACHING AND RESEARCH COMMITTEE MEETING December 1, 2022 - 1:00 p.m. Meeting Summary Global & National Security Policy Institute UNM Colleges/Schools (Honors, SOE, ASM) Project ECHO Diplomat in Residence Career Services B. KUNM Radio Annual Report TAB R Richard Towne, KUNM Station Manager KUNM listening area includes much of northern New Mexico, as far South as Socorro. Transmitted from towers on Sandia Mountains. KUNM's contributing listeners and local program sponsors provide about $1.5 million of the station's annual cash budget of about $2.1 million. Individual donor's average gift in FY22 $174. Total gifts: $1,401,800 Starting in FY19, KUNM began receiving planned gifts that have been \"in the works\" for about a decade. Planned gifts are in greater amounts than typical annual gifts, driving up the average gift amount. KUNM continues to see success as a self -supporting department at UNM. Revenues have exceeded expenses for the past 25 years. The station has an emergency reserve of $500,000 (2.5 months operating expenses) along with anticipate d planned gifts totaling just over $2,000,000. KUNM memorialized a 20 -year volunteer, Linda Lopez McAlister who died in 2022. Recommendations by Radio Board: KUNM continue expanding its streaming and digital content, including increasing digital availability of all programming, podcasting many locally produced programs, and promoting its internet services. Analyze downward trend in listenership numbers to ident ify key drivers That station management provide the Radio Board with any recommended changes to the KUNM program schedule, including proposed programming on its HD2 and HD3 platforms. Continue outreach efforts to KUNM students to increase awareness in KUNM Increasing broadcasting from 24- 72 hours a day (radio/web combined of youth- oriented music a week. Have an all music service and a news/talk information service. Delineating between these services should be attractive to listeners. II. Public Comment No comments III. Adjournment Motion to Adjourn: Provost Holloway Second: Regent Ko Adjournment: 4:32 PM UNM Student Wellness DR. ERIC SCOTT VICE PRESIDENT FOR STUDENT AFFAIRS UNM BOARD OF REGENTS SSTAR MEETING FEBRUARY 2ND, 2023Purpose and Agenda Generate a common understanding of the research -informed dimensions of wellness that may serve as key factors in planning and implementing a successful wellness plan and culture at a university. Consider the coordination of programs, practices, or initiatives and emerging opportunities for future growth related to wellness at UNM. Engage in constructive dialogue about the next steps in advancing wellness at UNM.Student Wellness Student learning is at the core of the academic mission. Students' physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual health and well -being have a significant influence on their academic and personal success. Creating a campus environment that supports student health and safety is therefore an important, broad institutional responsibility that requires commitment and activities both inside and outside the classroom. -NASPA Wellness and Health Promotion Knowledge Community Wellness has been empirically tied to student success and is relevant for students from all backgrounds and levels of study (Baldwin & Towler , 2017). UNM is diverse, so efforts to support wellness must also be diverse. Research on Student Wellness is broad and interrelated, but can be placed into several 'buckets'UNM 2040 Opportunity Defined Wellness Connections Goal One: Advance New Mexico Goal Two: Student Experience and Educational Innovation Goal Three: Inclusive Excellence Goal Four: Sustainability Goal Five: One UniversityBasic Needs and Physical Health At a base level, students need access to safe and reliable housing, food, and transportation to meet their basic needs. Once these needs are met, understanding and consuming a healthy diet, regularly exercising, and getting the right amount of sleep advance the physical health of students, which can prepare them to be successful in other facets of wellness. Detriments to physical health, such as substance use disorder, present an opportunity cost for physical wellness and mental health. See: Balzer & London (2020), Hege et al. (2021), Dunston et al. (2020), Haskett et al. (2021), Arria et al. (2013).Mental Health Effectively dealing with the stressors of college life is critical to student success. Common mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression, and more serious ones should be identified and treated proactively. There is often a reciprocal relationship between physical and mental wellbeing. Universities must provide proactive and responsive services for mental health support. See: Eisenberg et al. (2009), Scwitzer et al. (2018).Academic Success Academic challenges and the pressure to succeed can often take a toll on other elements of wellness. Maintaining strong study habits, staying organized, and knowing how and where to seek help when needed can contribute to wellness. Universities should maintain a robust and accessible network of academic support resources and proactively identify students who may benefit from additional academic support. See: Baldwin & Towler (2017), Ruthig et al. (2011).Social Support & Sense of Belonging A strong network of social support that might include friends, family, mentors, and peers is helpful in coping with the challenges of college life. In the context of social support, as with other interactions within the university, students need a sense of belonging and validation of their lived experiences. Through a variety of outlets, faculty and staff should build strong and authentic relationships with students and encourage social support, including engagement in activities that provide a social and emotional outlet. A sense of belonging also has an impact on spiritual wellbeing. See: Stallman et al. (2018), Strayhorn et al. (2015), Soria et al. (2022), Baker (2013), Sadeghifard et al. (2020).Financial Stability Money is often a major source of stress for college students. Effectively managing finances and accessing resources that reduce financial stress can help students feel more financially stable and meet college costs over time. Services that help students identify and manage financial resources can reduce this major stressor. See: McNair et al. (2022), Falcon (2015).Work Life Balance Balancing school, work, and personal life can present varying degrees of difficulty for students. Practicing time management and learning to strategically prioritize tasks can help students achieve a healthy balance and address the many demands on them without the addition of new stress. With more thorough understanding of time as a limited resource and more effective time management skills, students may be able to invest time wisely in wellness and/or student success. See: Krumrei-Mancuso et al. (2013), Tusuf et al. (2020)Equity It is critical that students encounter culturally relevant and culturally responsive resources and experiences. Equity must be a prime consideration in wellness as some students may experience disproportionate barriers or lack of access, while inequality itself can impact a student's physical, emotional, and mental wellness. Institutions should assess whether services are equitable and whether students are being reached by services so that students may be more equitably impacted by wellness initiatives. See: Strayhorn et al. (2015), Baker (2013), Lopez (2018)UNM programs, practices, & initiatives A non -exhaustive list in the attached resource provides a cross section of resources, programs, initiatives, and services that are aligned with key factors and best practices advancing student wellness at UNM. Emerging opportunities exist and are in various stages of development and implementation. More intentional coordination, collaboration is a priority (Associate Dean of Students for Student Wellbeing, LoboWell working concept). Access, visibility, and equity are key in implementation.

The UNM-Los Alamos program has been developed as an online program. Rather than duplicating an existing program and competing with it for enrollments, it may be wise to engage UNM-Los Alamos in a collaboration with the overall goal of increasing the number of well\u00ad trained firefighters in New Mexico. On behalf of the UNM Office of the Provost and EVP for Academic Affairs, I support this proposed AAS moving forward with the understanding that UNM -Gallup will engage in conversations with UNM -Los Alamos and other interested branches, such as UNM -Valencia, on a collaborative rather than duplicative and competitive approach to offering the AAS in Fire Science. I would like to request that the outcome of a discussion on collaboration, whether successful or unsuccessful, be represented in an attachment or other documentation in the fmal AAS proposal. The UNM-Gallup Faculty Assembly President, Dr. Matthew Mingus, has requested that the process for curriculum review and approval for branch campus programs be re-examined in 2022-23. I will make sure that this re-examination occurs this academic year. Please be advised that the re-examination could impact new certiflcate or program approval timelines.

This degree will be based entirely on Los Alamos's current program (which utilizes FESHE curriculum). We've been asked by the Associate Provost to meet with representatives from the Los Alamos and Valencia branches so that we can potentially work out some kind of collaborative arrangement regarding Fire Science. We are certainly not interested in competing with other branch programs or drawing students from other branch programs. In an effort to minimize any potential adverse consequences of our new program, we'd love to meet with you soon over Zoom to talk about it. I've set up a when2meet survey to try to figure out a good time next week to meet. Please fill out your availability by using this link: htt~s:LLwww.when2meet.comL?16781359-y:UJQu I appreciate your time and attention. Matthew D. Mingus Associate Professor of History University of New Mexico-Gallup 505.863.7558 10/3112022, 8: 19 AM AAS in Fire Science Executive Summary University of New Mexico -Gallup Program Description Goals. This proposed AAS degree in Fire Science is intended to prepare students for employment in a wide range of fields related to fire science and firefighting . As the earth warms, and as fire disasters become a more endemic problem in the Mountain West, UNM -Gallup wants to help prepare the next generation of firefighters to meet that challenge. Not only could our potential graduates contribute to wildland firefighting regionally, but they could also be retained as local firefighters for the city of Gallup, McKinley County, the Navajo Nation Fire Department, and other local agencies. Branch mission alignment . A key component of UNM -Gallup 's vision/ mission is to support students in pursuing \"community focused, regionally specific, and culturally vibrant education.\" By preparing students for employment opportunities in fire science, and by potentially bolstering our local pool of qualified firefighters, this proposed AAS program supports that mission. UNM mission & strategic plan alignment. The fourth goal of UNM's most recent strategic plan is, in part, to work \"with comm unity partners\" to \"ensure that all populations in New Mexico have access to the highest quality health care.\" The creation of this AAS program would help to increase our pool of frontline emergency responders in and around Gallup, New Mexico - a community that is chronically underserved and understaffed by healthcare professionals. Moreover, as the state continues to suffer from a prolonged period of drought, maintaining a staff of high -quality firefighters has become necessary for the health and safety of our communities. Other branch campuses. UNM -Los Alamos currently offers an AAS degree in Fire Science. We would like to adopt their program in its entirety. Employer involvement. This AAS degree will be supervised, in part, by an advisory board comprised of representatives from local stakeholders. Ideally, this board will have representatives from the city of Gallup, from McKinley County, from the Navajo Nation, the Zuni Pueblo and from professional and volunteer fire departments around the area. Timeline. Assuming approval, we would like to see the program begin with a cohort of students during the fall 2024 semester. Evidence of Need Demand. The health industry is the fastest -growing sector of the U.S. economy. Firefighting jobs are expected to grow 8% (\"as fast as average\") over the next ten years. The Gallup Fire Department currently employs forty -two (42) uniformed firefighters who respond to over 6000 calls for help each year. The McKinley County Fire Department has just nine professional firefighters on staff, but over 200 volunteer firefighters. Many of these first responders need continual professional development, and many of them are looking for opportunities to advance their careers through more education. The federal government has also a clear need to recruit and ret ain firefighters. UNM -Gallup anticipates that this demand will exist for decades into the future. Recruitment. Targeted recruitment efforts will include outreach and engagement with students who have expressed an interest in firefighting and emergency resp onse during their middle school and high school careers. These students will be identified in cooperation with Gallup -McKinley County Schools. Students will also be recruited through local firefighting agencies. Similar offerings in NM. Only three institutions in New Mexico have fire science associate's degree programs that have been certified by FESHE - Fire and Emergency Services in Higher Education, which is sponsored by the National Fire Academy . Those include: Central New Mexico Community College , Dona Ana Community C ollege , and Luna Community College . As mentioned earlier, UNM -Los Alamos has a program that adheres to the FESHE curriculum, but (so far as we can tell) it has not been formally certified by FESHE. San Juan College also has an associate's program in Fire Science. Formal Needs Assessment. Fire danger in the southwestern region of the United States is bad and getting worse . Wildfires in the state of New Mexico are projected to become more destructive and last longer in the future. In its most recent report (which starts on page 49 here), the Gal lup Fire Department indicated an increase in calls as well as an increase in \"major incidents\" per year since 2017. The report also makes it clear that the department suffers from \"staffing shortages\" and requires tens of thousands of hours of training eac h year.

UNM -Gallup will seek accreditation for this program through the Fire and Emergency Services Higher Education (FESHE) consortium. There is no fee for this accreditation, but our program curriculum (the curriculum we are currently proposing) would need to align with the FESHE curriculum. Evaluation and Assessment Measuring SLOs. Assessments would include learner self -assessments, peer assessments, and assessments by instructors, including quizzes, case studies, reflective writing and other assignments, portfolios, and performance -based assessments using standardized rubrics that crosscut, integrate, and apply the core competencies into real- world scenarios. Program Effectiveness and Plan to Assess Learning Outcomes. Students will complete a comprehensive, qualitative course evaluation, along with the standard UNM student evaluations. Periodic consul tations with local firefighting agencies and working firefighters will also provide feedback to inform curricular refinement. A systematic plan of evaluation will be required by the accrediting body to assess program outcomes. Required Resources To create a fire science technology program of study, a full -time faculty member (Lecturer II) will be needed to oversee the implementation of courses taught, outreach to and networking with local fire service professionals and organizations, and to teach cou rses associated with this proposed degree. Adjunct instructors will also be needed, as this program will included course offerings to be taught concurrently to secondary students within the Center for Career and Technical Education as well as strictly coll ege-level courses taught to those pursuing the AAS in Fire Science Technology. Budgeting for this program will have to include the following: Item Proposed Budgeted Amount FT faculty salary (Lecturer II) $51,185.00 FT faculty benefits $25,000.00 Adjunct faculty salaries $6000.00 Instructional Materials $2000.00 Training Materials $5000.00 Mileage $3000.00 Total $92,185.00 Projected Enrollment & Costs The Los Alamos Fire Science AAS program had eleven (11) students enrolled during the Fall 2021 semester, and seven (7) students enrolled during the Spring 2022 semester.

SSTAR Presentation February 2, 2023 Associate of Arts Chicana/o StudiesOverview UNM -Valencia requests permission to offer an Associate of Arts degree in Chicana/o Studies as a part of our involvement in the UNM Mellon Foundation grant: Extending Humanities Pathways. UNM -Valencia is excited about the potential of this program to assist us in creating new Humanities programming that will engage students and lead them to transfer to UNM -Albuquerque to pursue a bachelor's degree in a Humanities field. Program Credits: 61 Program Learning Outcomes: Upon successful completion of the required courses for the program, students will demonstrate: 1. Knowledge of effective communication in writing and speaking. 2. Understanding of the history and cultural context of the Chicanx /Latinx community. 3. Ability to apply critical thinking skills. 4. Ability to work with primary and secondary source material. Completion of this degree will provide students with skills in a variety of areas such as critical thinking, effective communication, analytical reasoning, and use of historical context, which will produce students who can succeed in a wide variety of majors and job opportunities. Evidence of Need 81% of UNM -Valencia's current student body has indicated a transfer major, as opposed to a career technical major. Many of these students are in Liberal Arts (10%) or Integrative Studies (15%), and thus typically transfer into a Social Sciences or Humanities major upon arrival at UNM -Albuquerque. We believe we have the student interest to support additional majors in these areas. Additionally, we believe that our particular student body will be interested in a Chicana/o Studies program. UNM -Valencia is both an Hispanic -Serving Institution and a Minority -Serving Institution, and our student body is 64% Hispanic/Latinx. This program will be the only program on campus that specifically addresses those particular social and cultural characteristics that the vast majority of our students can see directly applying in their daily lives. We believe that the content will resonate with our students and encourage them to continue their studies.

This program will be the only program on campus that specifically addresses those particular social and cultural characteristics that the vast majority of our students can see directly applying in their daily lives . We believe that the content will resonate with our students and encourage them to continue their studies. It is clear that when an academic field piques the interest of a student, and when a faculty member makes a personal connection to a student, that the likelihood of retention and persistence increases dramatically. 3. Program Content and Quality The curriculum for the Associate of Arts in C hicana/o Studies will consist of 61 credit hours . Upon completion, students will demonstrate effective written and communication skills, an understanding of the history and cultural context of the Chicanx/Latinx community, the ability to apply critical thinking skills, and the ability to work with primar y and secondary source material. 4. Evaluation and Assessment If approved, the Associate of Arts in Chicana/o Studies will follow the procedure for academic program review set forth by the Office of Assessment at UNM -Albuquerque . Internally, UNM -Valencia w ill track students' progress on an annual basis to ensure their timely graduation from the program. As with all UNM -Valencia programs and courses, the Associate of Arts in Chicana/o Studies will be subject to an annual assessment cycle of student learning outcomes and program outcomes evaluation in addition to cyclical program review . 5. Required Resources In terms of physical resources such as classroom, technology, equipment, instructional suppli es, library resources, etc., no additional cost is anticipated. All UNM -Valencia faculty have access to the Teaching and Learning Center, which provides training in the latest technologies available in the classrooms. Some courses will be face to face and some will be online. 6. Projected Enrollment and Costs We anticipate that this program will be moderate in size, beginning with course enrollments of around fifteen and approximately ten majors in the first two years. We hope to grow the program to twenty majors afterwards. The cost for the program to the student would be comparable to that of any associate's degree program, at t he current UNM -Valencia tuition rate of $7 8.25 per credit hour . No additional program fees will be charged. As we expand and grant funding winds down, UNM -Valencia will need to pick up the instructional costs from the Mellon grant , either adjunct instructors or potentially a new full -time faculty member if the numbers within the program demand. The current adjunct rate at UNM -Valencia is approximately $2,700 per three -credit hour course .

UNM -Valencia is excited about the potential of this program to assist us in creating new Humanities programming that will engage students and lead them to transfer to UNM -Albuquerque to pursue a bachelor's degree in a Humanities field. Program Credits: 60 An A.A. in English is a flexible degree. It will provide students with quality instruction in composition and rhetoric, American literature, literary analysis, creative writing, and core courses to facilitate mastery of knowledge and the attainment of skills necessary to complete a bachelor's degree in English. For students who pursue a B.A. in English, an undergraduate degree in English is one of the most versatile degrees in the Humanities. English students graduate with advanced skills in research, rhetoric, persuasive writing, critical reading and more. English graduates go on to careers in composition and rhetoric, creative writing, publishing, education, non- profit work, film, marketing, law, business, and others. For students who chose not to transfer to a 4- year institution, an A.A. in English will prepare them for jobs that require an associate's degree and strong communication skills. Evidence of Need 81% of UNM -Valencia's current student body has indicated a transfer major, as opposed to a career technical major. Many of these students are in Liberal Arts (10%) or Integrative Studies (15%), and thus typically transfer into a Social Sciences or Humanities major upon arrival at UNM -Albuquerque. We believe we have the student interest to support additional majors in these areas. The Liberal Arts degree at UNM -Valencia has had a concentration in English for years, but the concentration alone is not sufficient to prepare students to transfer to a bachelor's degree in English at UNM -Albuquerque. There is growing demand for workers with the soft and hard skills learned in English programs. These skills are translatable to a spectrum of professions, including, business, advertising, education, film, legal, and technology sectors.

To: D ean Laura Musselwhite From: Dr. Pamela Cheek, Associate Provost for Student Success Re: NEW ASSOCIATE OF ARTS PROGRAM : PRELIMINARY REVIEW AND PROPOSAL OUTLINE : UNM -Valencia, AA in English Date: October 18 , 2022 ______________________________________________________________________________ The proposed Associate of Arts in English has the potential to support humanities education and humanities student transfer to UNM. The expansion of the original UNM -CNM Humani ties Now! Partnership to include UNM's branch campus UNM -Valencia is timely. On behalf of Academic Affairs, I support moving this proposal for the AA in English forward to the next stages of curriculum review. As you consider how best to offer this program, it may be interesting to learn more about main campus offerings in rhetoric and technical writing (contact: Julie Newmark) as well as, of course, coordinating around the rich courses in literary and cultural studies.

Program Description UNM -Valencia requests permission to offer an Associate of Arts degree in response to community need. An A.A. in English would offer potential students in the UNM -V service area a chance to establish the requisite skills necessary for a smooth transfer into the B achelor's Program in English at UNM -Albuquerque . The Chair of Humanities at UNM -V has communicated with the Direct or of the B .A. in English program at UNM -ABQ, and has been assured that th e A.A. in English, as envisioned, will transfer seamlessly. Part of our impetus for the creation of a new program is to better meet the goals of the UNM -Mellon \"Expanding Humanities Pathways\" grant, of which all UNM branches are now participants. The grant, funded by the Mellon Foundation, is a three -year program designed to increase degree attainment rates, improve transfer rates, and improve degree completion rates in Humanities pro grams. We want to do our part in fulfilling the mission of this grant. Establishing an A .A. in English at UNM -V is a step in this direction. 2. Evidence of Need For years, UNM -Valencia has offered an Associate of Arts degree in Liberal Arts with a concentration in English, but this degree does not prepare students to transfer to a bachelor's degree in English at UNM -Albuquerque or elsewhere. Though UNM -V's English Department is one of the largest departments on campus (in terms of faculty), it lacks an academic program to center it and give it focus. We seek to rectify this with the creation of the AA in English. There is growing demand for workers with the soft and hard skills learned in English programs . These skills are translatable to a spectrum of professions , including, business, advertising, education, legal, and technology sectors . UNM -V has an established record of successfully transferring student s to UNM -Albuquerque. 81% of our current student body identifies as transfer majors, as opposed to majoring in a career technical field. Many of those students transfer in a Humanities or Social Sciences field, so we believe we have the student interest to support additional Humanities programming. 3. Program Content and Quality The curriculum for the Associate of Arts in English will consist of 6 0 credit hours. Upon completion, students will demonstrate skills in written and oral communication, critical thinking, research, rhetoric, and literary analysis. 4. Evaluation and Assessment If approved, the Associate of Arts in English will follow the procedure for academic program review set forth by the Office of Assessment at UNM -ABQ. Internally, UNM -V will track students' progress on an annual basis to ensure their timely graduation from the program. As with all UNM -V programs and courses, the Associate of Arts in English will be subject to an annual assessment cycle of student learning outcomes and pr ogram outcomes evaluation in addition to cyclical program review . 5. Required Resources In terms of physical resources such as classroom, technology, equipment, instructional supplies, library resources, etc., no additional cost is anticipated. All UNM -V faculty have access to the various spaces and technologies needed to support this program. Courses may be offered in online, hybrid, or face -to-face modalities as required. Currently , UNM -V has five full -time faculty qualified to te ach the courses listed in the program description. Although we do utilize adjunct faculty in the English program, no additional faculty would be required to execute the new program. 6. Projected Enrollment and Costs Based on the enrollments, initial and ongoing, in the Liberal Studies and Integrative Studies Associate of Arts programs, we anticipate a small start of perhaps 10- 15 students. However, because of the projected growth of employment opportunities, we be lieve th at this enrollment will grow . The cost for the program to the student would be comparable to that of any associate's degree program, at t he current UNM -V tuition rate of $78.25 per credit hour .

Program Description English programs are not just about reading and writing poetry and stories or studying great works of literature. An English degree is a window into the world of confident communication. English majors learn how to read analyze texts (written and otherwise), navigate the roads of rhetoric and propaganda, develop critical perspective appropriate to a variety of analytical or rhetorical situations , and persuade others toward ideas that might better the world. UNM -Valencia requests permission to offer an Associate of Arts degree in response to community need. An A.A. in English would offer potential students in the UNM -V service area a chance to establish the requisite skills necessary for a smooth transfer into the B achelor's Program in English at UNM -Albuquerque . The Chair of Humanities at UNM -V has communicated with the Director of the B .A. in English program at UNM -ABQ, and has been assured that th e A.A. in English, as envisioned, will transfer seamlessly.

We seek to rectify this with the creation of the AA in English. There is growing demand for workers with the soft and hard skills learned in English programs . These skills are translatable to a spectrum of professions, including, business, advertising, education, legal, and technology sectors. As UNM -V is proximal to several film studios representing some of the best known and most financially successful companies in the film, including Netflix, NBC and Universal , there is opportunity, as well, for students with English degrees to find their way into New Mexico's booming film industry. In addition, for those students who are willing to relocate, the US Department of Labor is projecting that employment in occupations for workers with an English d egree will grow 4% to 12% from 20 21 to 2031 , which includes some opportunities for applicants holding Associate degrees. (Occupational Outlook Handbook from the US Department of Labor, Sept. 2021 1). UNM -V has an established record of successfully transferring students to UNM-Albuquerque. 81% of our current student body identifies as transfer majors, as opposed to majoring in a career technical field. Many of those students transfer in a Humanities or Socia l Sciences field, so we believe we have the student interest to support additional Humanities programming. 1 \"Occupational Outlook Handbook.\" www.bls.gov , US Department of Labor, 8 Sept. 202 FA22 58 57 (total at UNMV) FA18 FA19 FA20 FA21 FA22 Art Studio 13 16 12 9 8 Criminology 44 40 39 25 22 Early Childhood Education 39 32 33 26 23 Elementary Education 36 28 28 25 27 Film and Digital Arts 20 25 23 15 16 Integrative Studies 141 129 102 65 65 Liberal Arts 87 72 69 49 39 3.

Required Resources In terms of physical resources such as classroom, techn ology, equipment, instructional supplies, library resources, etc., no additional cost is anticipated. All UNM -V faculty have access to the various spaces and technologies needed to support this program. Courses may be offered in online, hybrid, or face -to-face modalities as required. Currently , UNM -V has at least ten faculty members qualified to teach the courses listed in the program description. All the full -time English faculty are qualified to teach the courses with the ENGL prefix . With two recent full- time departures, we will be hiring two tenure -track English faculty for a start date of Fall 2023. We will be choosing candidates with experience teaching the classes we intend to offer for the AA in English. That said, the UNM -V English Department would benefit from hiring an additional tenure track English faculty. W e have, for decades , held steady at five full -time tenure -track English faculty. This is enough faculty to teach 60-70% of our classes, but we would like to have a sixth full -time member to increase consistency , versatility , and security in our teaching ranks and class offerings . 6. Projected Enrollment and Costs Based on the enrollments, initial and ongoing, in the Liberal Studies and Integrative Studies Associate of Arts programs, we anticipate a small start of perhaps 10- 15 students. However, because of the projected growth of employment opportunities, we be lieve that this enrollment will grow . The cost for the program to the student would be comparab le to that of any associate's degree program, at t he current UNM -V tuition rate of $78 .25 per credit hour . Maternal and Child Health Graduate Minor & Certificate College of Population Health Tammy Thomas, PhD, MSW, MPH Rationale for the program New Mexico ranks 49thin child well -being (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2021) New Mexicans face a number of MCH challenges including low birth weight babies, infant mortality, maternal mortality, a lack of medical providers, and the lack of access to services in rural and frontier communities (New Mexico Department of Health). There are currently no Public Health MCH programs in New Mexico. Potential Students & Workforce Outcomes All graduate and professional students are eligible to receive a minor in MCH. The MCH certificate will be available for non- university individuals who hold a bachelor's degree. Our aim is to recruit students from multiple disciplines to create a well -trained MCH workforce. Students are also eligible to receive a certificate in Interprofessional Education Honors offered through UNM Health Sciences Center . The MCH minor and certificate will increase the MCH workforce and provide trained professionals for vacant MCH positions across the state. This is especially important in high- risk communities where MCH issues impact morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Budget Projection Faculty and staff from the College of Population Health are sufficient for the delivery of the MCH curriculum. No additional faculty or staff will be required for the graduate minor and certificate and no extra cost will be required . The program will be budget neutral. We anticipate 10 -15 students enrolling in the minor and certificate in the first year. We expect the enrollment to increase as a result of cross campus collaborations, as well as outreach to community and governmental community partners. Thus, increasing revenue. The MCH courses have been approved for Interprofessional Education Honors credits offered through UNM Health Sciences Center and the courses are advertised through this program. We have been offering MCH courses: Introduction to MCH (Fall 2021) 22 Introduction to MCH (Summer 2022) 23 MCH Seminar 2 (Fall 2022) 7 MCH Seminar 1 (Spring 2023) 28 students The University of New Mexico MSC05 3340 1 University of New Mexico Albuquerque, NM 87131 -0001 Phone 505.277.4664 Fax 505.277.4665 seccretary.unm.edu Office of the Secretary Scholes Hall Room 103 February 1, 2023 TO: Board of Regents Student Success, Teaching and Research Committee FROM: Nancy D.

Program Description The proposed program includes a n undergraduate certificate in Maternal and Child Health (MCH) offered through the College of Population Health (COPH). The program will be open to community members working in MCH -related professions who hold a bachelor degree. These individuals can enroll in the graduate level certificate program. The MCH graduate level certificate will allow students to : (1) Develop the values needed to provide excellent MCH services; (2) Develop skills to evaluate community and individual needs, partner with communities and individuals in meaningful and equitable ways, and assist in creating authentic change to improve lives; (3) G ain specific MCH knowledge and learn how to integrate this knowledge into their specific field of practice; and (4) D evelop and practice the skills needed to be an excellent MCH practitioner and/or researcher. It is important to note that no MCH programs exist in New Mexico despite having a significant MCH needs. The M CH Bureau , NM Department of Health, has seen a large turnover in its workforce and expect s to see a continued trend in the next few years. New Mexico regularly ranks in the bottom (49th/50th out of 50) in child wellbeing according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation Kids Count Data. New Mexicans face a number of MCH challenges including high rat es of low birth weight babies, infant mortality, maternal mortality, a lack of medical providers, and the lack of access to services in rural and frontier communities. Having a trained MCH workforce in our New Mexico communities has the potential to reduc e the negative impacts and improve the quality of lives for women, children, and families. Additional academic training in MCH issues is vital to the state in numerous ways , and this proposed certificate will ensure that UNM is at the forefront of providing new training options for the state workforce. Thus, t he certificate in MCH is in line with UNM's mission by providing students with educational, research, and service opportunities in this area. The certificate in MCH contributes to the mission of the Health Sciences Center by educating the maternal and child health workforce in the knowledge and skills needed to ensure all New Mexicans have access to quality MCH care in communities throughout the state. The 2. Evidence of Need While we have not conducted a formal needs assessment for the MCH graduate level certificate program, we have talked to colleagues across campus who stated their students would be interested. We h ave students at the COPH who have expressed interested in the program and have had community members reach out to inquire about the program. From 2014 - 2021, the COPH offered a graduate professional development certificate in MCH public health which was funded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (DHHS). This was an established and well attended program, which speaks to topical interest. Additionally, we pilot -tested Introduction to Maternal Child Public Health and the MCH Seminar 1 and drew students from COPH and CON and a fellow from the School of Medicine. The COPH currently has a very robust and viable approach to recruiting undergraduate and graduate students. We will use the established recruiting system to share information about t he MCH certificate. 3. Program Content and Quality 505.272.4173 | College of Population Health | 1 University of New Mexico | MSC0 9 5070 | Albuquerque, NM 87131 coph. unm.edu The 12- credit MCH graduate level certificate courses were approved through the UNM curriculum and catalog committees for 2022- 2023 academic year. The MCH graduate level certificate consist of four 3- credit hour courses focusing on MCH topics. These courses include : Introduction to Maternal and Child Health; Seminar 1 MCH: History, Life Course Perspective, and Title V Programs; Seminar 2 MCH: Policy, Research, and Career Pathways; and Seminar 3 MCH: Communities, Diversity, and Cultural and Linguistic Responsiveness. The Intoduction to Maternal Child Public Health course and the 3 seminars are delivered fully online. Student learning objectives have been tailored to each individual class. All courses utilize d a combination of reading, discussion, vidoes, website review, reflection exerci ses, and reseach projects to meet the learning objectives. The Council for Education in Public Helath is the national accrediting body for public health education programs. The certificate program will not require separate accedi tation and will not impact the accr editation for COPH. 4. Evaluation and Assessment The learning objectives for the graduate level certificate program were modeled after the MCH Leadership Competencies developed by HRSA - Maternal and Child Health Bureau for MCH programs. The competencies include: MCH knowledge base, self -reflection, ethics, critical thinking, communication, negotiation and conflict resolut ion, cultural competency, family -professional partnerships, developing others through teaching, coaching, and mentoring, interdisciplinary/interprofessional team building, working with communities/systems, and policy. 5. Required Resources The MCH graduate level certificate program will require four existing C OPH faculty to teach the courses once a year as part of their regular teaching load . One faculty will oversee the administrative duties in collaboration with COPH administrative staff. Two faculty me mbers will teach the four core courses. The faculty will hold either a master's degree or PhD and have expertise in teaching maternal and child health courses. The MCH graduate level c ertificate program should require little extra work for the existing f aculty and staff. No additional faculty or staff will be required for the certificate program and no extra cost will be required. 6. Enrollment The MPH program currently has an enrollment of almost 75 students, and we anticipate enrollment growing over the next year. Many of our community members and students are interested in MCH related courses and have inquired about a graduate level certificate. Based on our discussions with our current students, we anticipate 10 - 15 students initially enrolling in the graduate level certificate. We offered the PH 560 (Introduction to MCH -PH now offered as PH 571) in the summer 2022 WITH 15 graduate level students. We are currently offering the PH 571 course in Fall 2022 and have 5 students registered. In both semeste rs, we had students from main and HSC campuses representing multiple disciplines, including medicine, nursing, architecture, business, population health. The MCH curriculum has been approved for Interprofessional Education Program (IPEP). 7. Other 505.272.4173 | College of Population Health | 1 University of New Mexico | MSC0 9 5070 | Albuquerque, NM 87131 coph. unm.edu We develo ped the four courses and pilot tested in AY 2022. The curriculum and catalog committees approved the courses for the current 2022- 2023 catalog year, and we are offering the courses now as PH 571, 572, 573 and 574. We are proposing the graduate level MCH certificate to begin in the fall of 202 3. We have develop ed a recruitment and outreach plan for students at the COPH and across campus. Additionally, we are promot ing this program to working professionals interested in increasing their MCH knowledge a nd skill base.

We will use the established recruiting system to share information about the MCH certificate. If the program fills a regional workforce need, describe collaboration between your institution and regional employers in program development. Max 500 words. It is important to note that no MCH programs exist in New Mexico despite having a significant MCH needs. The M CH Bureau , NM Department of Health, has seen a large turnover in its workforce and expects to see a continued tren d in the next few years. New Mexico regularly ranks in the bottom (49th/50th out of 50) in child wellbeing according to the Annie E. Casey Foundation Kids Count Data. New Mexicans face a number of MCH challenges including high rates of low birth weight babies, infant mortality, maternal mortality, a lack of medical providers, and the lack of access to services in rural and frontier communities. Having a trained MCH workforce in our New Mexico communities has the potential to reduce the negative impacts an d improve the quality of lives for women, children, and families. E.

Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure 2 New Graduate Certificate Full Proposal Outline 1. Program Description and Purpose The Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure is designed for an individual holding a baccalaureate degree or holding or completing an advanced degree in a major content area (Mathematics, Science, Social Studies, English, Spanish, German, French or Din\u00e8), ) who want to pursue a New Mexico Level I Teaching License in Secondary Education to teach in grades 7 -12. This Graduate Certificate would supplant the MA in Secondary Education with Licensure degree pathway. Many individuals are interested in becoming teachers who do not want maste r's degrees, who already hold master s' degrees in their co ntent areas, or who are enrolled in another master 's degree programs and would like to become teachers. The Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure would be open to graduates and graduate students from varied fields, career changers with diverse previous job experiences from either the private sector or the public sector, and current graduate students in other programs who are interested in careers in teaching secondary education. Those completing this program will have completed all the necessary requirements to be licensed teachers by the State of New Mexico, pending their passage of the state licensure tests. The Graduate Certificate in Secondary Licensure is ready to be implemented upon completion of this approval process, ideally in Fall 2024. The major goals for the Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure are To increase the number of qualified, competent, caring, and diverse teachers of secondary students in grades 7 -12 in New Mexico; Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure 3 To recruit university graduate students and career changers in the New Mexico community and from other areas of the country for a post -BA licensure program that can be completed in two semesters; To prepare teachers who possess professional understandings, practices, and identities that enable them to provide meaningful learning experiences of the highest quality for al l secondary students; and To meet accountability measures within the university and outside accrediting agencies and the New Mexico Legislature for tracking program \"completers.\" Currently the licensure program is embedded in the master's program which mak es tracking student progress difficult when students opt out of the master's program after completing licensure requirements. These students are recorded as \"non -completers.\" This proposed graduate certificate will allow the College of Education and Human Sciences to track licensure student enrollments and completions at the graduate level. b. How does the program fit within the participating unit's future plans? The proposed Graduate Certificate in Secon dary Education with 7 -12 Licensure is housed within the Secondary Education Program in the Teacher Education , Educational Leadership and Policy Department (TEELP) of the College of Education and Human Sciences at UNM. One of the major goals of COEHS Dean H ansel Burley's goals is recruitment of students to the college. The proposed Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure will recruit students in various departments across campus who are completing bachelors' degrees, students in grad uate programs who can add this certificate as part of their program of study, and employees in area businesses and organizations thus strengthening the unit's connections within and outside of the university. The proposed Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure provides a Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure 4 new model of teacher education using existing resources, as well as providing research opportunities for faculty. The proposed program also has the potential to meet several components mentioned by the external rev iew team in the TEELP Academic Program Review conducted in spring 2022. The APR External Review Committee stated the following: The number of paths or degree concentrations in teacher preparation results in confusion for students and administrators. It se ems the variety of specialized pathways are overly complex. This may need to be revisited in order to simplify the process. (TEELP APR Report 2022, p. 3) Maintain discussions of alternative avenues to generate additional revenue while sustaining programm atic quality and rigor. Several groups interviewed as part of the external review process stated that discussions regarding possible forms of alternative ways to help generate revenue for the COEHS while sustaining programmatic quality and rigor. Individuals understood that it wa s important to maintain the high quality and rigor within programs to reflect the preparation of educators and educational leaders to support the children of New Mexico today and in the future. (TEELP APR Report 2022, p. 8) This proposed Graduate Certifi cate will streamline the completion of licensure in Secondary Education, decoupling it from the current MA in Secondary Education with Licensure. In addition, this Graduate Certificate will enable TEELP to more successfully recruit and thus increase revenu es to the COEHS. c. How does the program fit within the UNM mission and strategic plan? Does this a. Does the program overlap or duplicate any existing program within UNM? In the state and/or region? Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure 5 The recent economic downturn coupled with the COVID -19 pandemic has resulted in increased unemployment and many individuals seeking retraining in order to reenter the workforce. By providing an alternative route to 7 -12 licensure for UNM graduate students and career changers, the program fits within the University of New Mexico mission and strategic plan by contributing to the state and national economies as well as helping graduates lead satisfying lives as they leave the program and pursue teaching positi ons throughout the state of New Mexico, the nation, and beyond. In addition, this Graduate Certificate will allow students in various content area degree fields across the University to add teaching credentials to their programs of study. New Mexico is in the midst of a dire teacher shortage. The Southwest Outreach Academic Research Evaluation & Policy Center, authors of the SOAR Report (October 2021), stated that teacher vacancies almost doubled over the past year from 571 in 2020 to 1,048 in 2021 . Of those vacancies 376 ( 36%) were at the secondary level . This Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure will enable the Department of Teacher Education, Educational Leadership and Policy to package our secondary education licensure program to more easily recruit potential students to become teachers in secondary education . These students will be able to complete this certificate and licensure requirements within one year, thus assisting to alleviate the severe shortage of secondary education teachers in New Mexico. The University of New Mexico has a stated commitment to increase graduation rates and to provide support and structures that will facilitate increased numbers of students completing degree and certificate programs. Within the TEELP Department, there are post -BA students who come with the desire to complete the requirements for teaching licenses so that they can enter the workforce expediently. Many students enroll in the MA in Secondary Education with Licensure Program, complete the licensure requirements, and then drop out of the program, thus being counted as \"non -completers.\" The proposed Gradua te Certificate in Secondary Education with 7- Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure 6 12 Licensure would address this issue by providing students with a licensure -only option that would allow them to have their program completion appear on their transcripts as a Graduate Certificate and allow them to enter the work force with this transcripted credential . Teacher education programs are being examined and audited as the accountability movement has turned its gaze on institutions of higher education. Federal and state agencies are asking how teachers are being prepared and what can be done to improve teacher qua lity to improve K -12 student academic achievement. Providing accurate and complete data to outside accrediting agencies, as well as for analysis by faculty for continuous improvement, is imperative. The proposed Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure would allow for a more accurate tracking of licensure student completers. The proposed certificate program would also provide an opportunity to faculty for studying best practices in a teacher preparation program that focuses on licensu re for post -BA students. c. Does the program overlap or duplicate any existing program within UNM? In the state and/or region? The Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure will replace the current MA in Secondary Education with Licensure, therefore this new program does not overlap or duplicate any existing program within the University of New Mexico. All universities in New Mexico are required by the New Mexico Public Education Department to provide an alternative licensure rout e to teaching licensure. This Graduate Certificate satisfies this requirement. d. What is the governance structure of the program? Currently the alternative licensure pathway for secondary education licensure is housed within the Secondary Education Program in the TEELP Department. The Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure will be governed by Secondary Educat ion Program faculty and monitored and supported by the Chair of the TEELP Department. As is the practice in Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure 7 the College of Education and Human Sciences, the initial approval for the Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure includes r eview and approval by the Secondary Education Program Faculty, the TEELP Department Faculty, the COEHS Graduate Committee made up of representatives from all academic program units within the Coll ege, the COEHS full faculty, the COEHS Dean, the UNM Senate Graduate Committee, the UNM Faculty Senate, and the Provost. One new course, EDUC 564: Graduate Seminar in Secondary Teaching is being proposed to decouple the seminar from the field experience. The Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Lic ensure otherwise utilizes courses already being taught in the Department. The remaining courses and syllabi were approved by the New Mexico Public Education Department Professional Standards Commission in 2019. e. For interdisciplinary programs, describe the responsibilities of each participating unit? This is not an interdisciplinary program. The proposed program includes only the professional education courses required for licensure in secondary education and offered within the College of Education and Human Sciences. f. What is the program development and implementation timeline? The program of studies for the Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure is already in place within the MA in Secondary Education with Licensure. This program of studies was approved through the COE process in 2002. The timeline for formal approval of this program of studies in this Graduate Certificate is the following: g. Spring 2022 Approval by the COE HS Dean, Provost, and the Dean of Graduate Studies h. Spring 2022 Submission and review by the Faculty Senate Graduate Committee i. Fall 2022 Submission and review by the Faculty Senate j. Fall 2022 Approval by the Provost Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure 8 k. Fall 2024 Implementation of the Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure 2. Student Impact a. How many students are projected to enroll? We anticipate 60-70 students to enroll in the program each year. b. From where will these students be drawn? This graduate certificate will draw from three groups of secondary licensure candidates: 1) Interested students enrolled in graduate degree programs within the university who want to pursue teaching licenses during their current programs of study in a particular content area; 2) Educational Assistants and substitute teachers with bachelor's degrees who wish to become classroom teachers; 3) Career changers within the community who hold baccalaureate or advanced degrees and want to pursue licensure; and 4) Current teachers -of-record who are teaching with temporary alternative licenses issued by the New Mexico Public Education Department and want to complete Level 1 license requirements through the UNM. c. What are the demographic characteristics and educational goals of the target students? In the 2020 -2021 school year 60 students were enrolled in the one -year MA in Secondary Education with Licensure Program. We anticipate more students to enroll in the Graduate Certificate program because this pathway will be transcripted and can be specifi cally marketed to potential applicants in specific content areas in Arts & Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure 9 Sciences. The target educational goal of those attaining this Graduate Certificate is to gain the knowledge, skills, and professional dispositions necessary to become an effective teacher. Further, students will be able to return to UNM to apply these graduate certificate credit hours toward a Master's Degree in Secondary Education.

No new faculty are needed at this time for the proposed Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure. All the proposed courses are existing courses with the addition of one graduate seminar, which are offered on a planned schedule. However, with anticipated growth in student enrollment, TEELP will require more faculty to implement a quality teacher preparation program with expert teacher educators in each content area and additional seminar instructors and university supervisors, especially with bilingual language skills. b. How will this program affect the workload of current faculty and support staff? Current faculty, temporary part -time faculty, and support staff workloads will not be initially changed by the proposed Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure due to the fact that the program will utilize existing courses and instr uctors. However, as indicated above, with anticipated enrollment growth, additional faculty will be required to deliver a quality teacher preparation program. TEELP has recently received Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure 17 approval by the Provost to hire additional licensure tenure/tenure -track faculty and lecturers to mee the growing demand of those wanting to become teachers. c. Will additional faculty or staff be required? What is the cost? No additional faculty or staff will be required to implement the program at this time. d. What faculty and staff development services will be needed ? No additional faculty and staff development services will be needed at this time for the proposed Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure because all the courses already exist , along with one new course and are being taught currently in the Secondary Education Program. All Secondary Education faculty are skilled in teaching all the Graduate Certificate courses. e. What impact will enrollments in the certificate program have on student support (GA & TA positions, scholarships, etc.)? No new GA or TA positions, nor scholarships, will be required for implementation of the proposed program. f. What technology, media, equipment , and instructional supplies are needed to reach these learning outcomes? Are these resources available? What is the estimated cost? No additional technology, media, equipment , and instructional supplies are required for the proposed Graduate Certificate program. All existing resources are sufficient for imple menting the proposed program. g. Are there any needs for additional or renovated space? There is no need for additional or renovated space to implement the proposed Graduate Certificate program. All existing spaces are sufficient for implementing the propose d program. 18 h. What student support services are likely to be needed and to what extent (CAPS, Library, ITS, advising, etc.)? What is the estimated cost? The existing student support services will provide sufficient support for the proposed Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure . There is no anticipated additional cost to implement the proposed program. i. Provide a rationale for any course fees or other expenses (in addition to tuition) that students will be expected to cover. All students in the College of Education and Human Sciences , including students in the proposed Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure are charged a one-time $125 fee for the Tk20 system to house their electronic portfolios and teaching data. A $15 fee per semester allows all COE students to utilize printing in the technology centers. A $105 course fee for each semester of field experien ce covers the cost of supervision during the students' student teaching experiences. 5. Accreditation Plan a. How does the program affect any existing accreditation and licensure requirements? The proposed Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure program meets the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) accreditation requirements for secondary teacher education programs. The proposed program also meets the New Mexico Public Education Department's requirements for a l icense in Secondary Education. No new accreditation or state licensure requirements are required. b. If new accreditation is required, describe the accreditation process and the expenses involved. 19 No new accreditation is required , except for New Program app roval from the Department of Higher Education of the State of New Mexico. 6. Additional Information a. Provide any additional information needed to make the case for development of a proposal. All universities in New Mexico are required by the New Mexico Public Education Department to provide an alternative licensure route to teaching licensure. At UNM, the alternative licensure program, approved by the New Mexico Public Education in 2002, is currently nested within the MA in Secondary Education with Licen sure. At the present time, this structure impedes enrollment of graduate students in other programs within the university from seeking alternative teaching licensure according to OGS regulations (i.e., students may be enrolled in only one graduate degree p rogram at a time). This new graduate certificate program would allow these students to pursue a transcripted certificate in secondary licensure, obtain an alternative teaching license from New Mexico Public Education Department and be hired for a ful - time teaching position (if desired), and still maintain graduate status in their chosen degree program. This feature of the Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure program would make it possible for not only graduate students within the College of Education and Human Sciences (i.e. Special Education; Language, Literacy and Socio -Cultural Studies; and Educational Psychology) to work toward secondary licensure, it also means that graduate students from other colleges and departments within the university (e.g., Engineering, History, English, Anthropology, Biology, Mathematics, Fine Arts, Dance, Nursing, Business, all language programs, etc.) could work toward adding a secondary teaching license to their graduate degrees. The 20 Graduate Certif icate in Secondary Education with 7-12 Licensure provides UNM students with additional options for future employment while also bringing into teaching individuals with strong content area backgrounds to work with students in middle schools and high schools . Proposed Catalog Listing Graduate Certificate in Secondary Education with 7 -12 Licensure Interested applicants should consult with the Secondary Graduate Licensure Coordinator or a Secondary Education Faculty member before applying to the Graduate Certificate Program in order to have their transcripts reviewed for the required content coursewo rk required for licensure. Students must be formally admitted to the Graduate Certificate Program in order to enroll in the Graduate Certificate Program courses.

As the principal investigator of the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), Childhood Asthma Research and Education (CARE) Network and AsthmaNet projects (all sponsored by NHLBI), I have been able to collaborate with colleagues nationally, investigate asthma management from infancy to adulthood in order to learn about the natural history of asthma, and evaluate existing and new therapies for asthma tailored to individual patients. In addition, I participate in pharmaceutical sponsored Phase II-IV trials evaluating novel asthma therapies in children and adult patients. I also have interest in cystic fibrosis (CF) research and the opportunity for our CF patients to participate in clinical trials offering novel therapies for CF. Currently, I am the co-principal investigator of UNM Pediatric Clinical Trial Center in Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) IDeA States Pediatric Clinical Trials Network (ISPCTN). The Clinical Sites of the ISPCTN will conduct multicenter clinical trials research, assuring the participation of children living in rural or underserved communities located in IDeA states, and build pediatric research capacity for IDeA states to support the conduct of clinical trials of relevance to rural or underserved children in IDeA states. This network supports clinical trial pediatric research in the 5 focus areas of the ECHO program including: pre-, peri-, and postnatal outcomes; obesity; upper and lower airways; neurodevelopment; and positive health. With the COVID-19 pandemic, I am coordinating the efforts of the University clinical trials. In addition, My colleagues and I ( MPI) have been funded to be a site for RECOVER study - adult and pediatric cohorts- to learn more about post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2. SERVICE INTERESTS In a clinical setting at Pediatrics Pulmonary clinic, I provide pharmacotherapy consult and practice as a pharmacist clinician. This service gives me the opportunity not only to understand what is important in the clinical setting, but also to design research aims as they apply to clinical practice. The interaction with faculty, residents and other multidisciplinary health care providers in the clinic setting creates a perfect environment to teach, discuss ideas and to learn about different aspects of a condition. TEACHING INTERESTS I will continue providing lectures in management of asthma as well as presentation of new finding and publications resulted from ongoing research. in addition to disease specific lectures, I have given several lectures on research and clinical trials to hearth are providers. I will also continue my efforts in Envision, which enhances patient care and allows providers in all areas of NM opportunities to implement national guidelines for asthma. I will continue my collaboration with Envision, American Lung Association and NMCoA Education and health policy makers to improve education and the care of patients with asthma in NM.

Over the past few years, I would say one of the most often repeated phrases we hear is \"I didn't know Continuing Education did that\". While UNM Continuing Education (UNMCE) has been around for nearly 100 years, it is often surprising to me the perception that many still have of the programs and activities that exist at UNMCE. Often the image that comes to mind is that Continuing Education is primarily for the retirement community looking for fun and stimulating programs that promote lifelong learning. UNM Continuing Education does serve that community, offering 100's of programs each year through our personal enrichment programs and the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute, but UNMCE serves a much broader and diverse community. Professional Development and Career Training UNMCE has, for at least 60 years or more, offered many professional development programs to individuals and organizations. While programs have evolved over the years to keep current with the changing needs of the workforce, the current climate of constantly changing technologies and workforce development challenges has greatly impacted UNMCE. It is more imperative than ever that to predict and respond quickly to these community and workforce needs to provide the practical tools and education that will help individuals and organizations thrive. We currently create dozens of new non-credit certificate and certification programs per year, update existing curriculum and/or remove programs that are no longer relevant to the community. Often UNMCE career and professional development programs are perceived as entry-level training or an alternative to those who do not wish to enter a degree seeking program. While UNMCE does serve that demographic, the student base for career and professional development is much broader. Our students come from a wide variety of socio-economic backgrounds and who are on unique paths on their career journey. We serve students who are looking to change careers, start a new business, new leaders, existing leaders, front-facing customer service staff, front- and back-end coders, accountants, project managers, entrepreneurs, and much more.4 Personal Enrichment Programs Basket weaving may have been the traditional thought about the types of classes offered at UNM Continuing Education, but even our personal enrichment programs have evolved in the past few years. Developing programs can be a challenge as personal tastes and trends change. Fitness and health trends change as do hobbies and social interaction. UNMCE keeps ahead of the curve by keeping an ear to the ground and eye to the future in developing new programs for all ages. Osher Lifelong Learning Institute The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute (OLLI) at the University of New Mexico offers academically oriented non-credit programming for adults 50 plus. There are no admission requirements, tests or grades - just interesting classes in a variety of topics such as history, art history, creative writing, art appreciation and more. Member benefits include free member-only events, access to UNM Libraries, discounts on Personal Enrichment programs and discounts at Popejoy. Conference Center Continuing Education has a 650 seat Auditorium and approximately 15,000 square feet available that is available for rental to UNM departments and the public. Rental prices are priced for community use and UNM Departments receive a substantial discount on facility rentals. State of the art technology is available at no charge, other services offered is full day tech support, equipment rental and more. Many schools and organizations utilize the center for conferences, graduations, public events, entertainment, religious services, weddings, showers, and other public events. 5Connection to the Community UNMCE is deeply connected to the New Mexico community and beyond. UNMCE has a student base of approximately 25,000 with over 5,000 students enrolling in classes each year. At present, approximately 90% of our students are based in New Mexico but we have students who participate in our programs throughout the United States and around the world. We have over 200 instructors and vendors who teach our programs and add to the vast community network. Our base staff of 18 employees serve on many boards and are involved in many community programs including United Way of New Mexico, Albuquerque Quality Network, UPCEA, American Marketing Association, Street Food Institute, Big Brother Big Sisters, CMED, American Society for Clinical Pathology, Southwest Writers, Osher NRC, NAADAC and more. A Bridge to the University Due to the unique nature of UNMCE and its student base, UNMCE can be a helpful bridge between the community and the University both in helping students find appropriate degree programs and jobs, in addition to other opportunities at the University. UNMCE has a wide variety of knowledge of expertise and tools in the noncredit programing, including registration software and customer service, analytical tools to forecast career and skill demands, noncredit learning management system and support, marketing services, and consulting. It is widely known that University colleges and departments often work in silos, creating duplicate programs and work and this is being addressed in UNM 2040 plan. The past two years, UNMCE in partnership with UNM IT, Anderson School of Management, and the College of Education and Human Sciences piloted several programs to launch a shared service, where UNMCE administers the noncredit registrations for the other departments and also facilitates the noncredit learning management system. The pilot demonstrated the effectiveness of such collaborations where IT support was minimized, costs were reduced to the departments, and customer service and ease of registrations improved to the students. This pilot has led to other UNMCE and University Department Partnerships. The Nuclear Engineering Department, The University of New Mexico Child Maltreatment Prevention Symposium, Taos Branch Campus and The Support Center for Microsystems Education.6 There are also many current discussions regarding how we further strengthen and leverage these partnerships. Noncredit programs can be a gateway to degree programs and provide visibility to students who may not be aware of further educational opportunities at UNM. These partnerships will continue to be a primary focus for UNMCE in FY23. Business Model Many also find UNMCE's business model quite surprising. The department is self-sustainable and is entirely funded by the revenues derived directly through the department programs and activities. Currently, UNMCE generates approximately $4M in gross annual revenue. Approximately 90% of the revenue is generated from community program course fees. 5% revenue comes from facility rental revenue and 5% from grants/endowments. All revenue generating departments within UNMCE have specific revenue goals and allocations to the operating costs of the entire unit. Surplus revenue is used to reinvest in department development, technology and facility maintenance and upgrades. 7UNMCE and the 2040 Plan Just as UNMCE's Mission and Vision is a subset of the UNM Mission and Vision, UNMCE looks to collaborate and support the UNM 2040 vision. Some of this year's initiatives in 2022 are as follows: Relevant and affordable noncredit programs provide opportunities to the entire New Mexico community to contribute to the quality of life, growth, prosperity, and advancement for all. Programs that had high rate of new job creation, promotion or entry level job include: Paralegal Studies Cannabis Business Programs Data Analytic Bootcamps Phlebotomy Practical Project Management University Partnerships support the \"One University\" goal to align and integrate initiatives and strengthen the University and its impact. Current University Partners include: Anderson School of Management College of Education Human Sciences The Nuclear Engineering Department The University of New Mexico Child Maltreatment Prevention Symposium Taos Branch Campus The Support Center for Microsystems Education. Pre-Law Summer Institute for American Indians and Alaska Natives UNMCE partners with many organizations to locate funding resources for noncredit students. Current partners include: Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) U.S. Department of Veteran Affair Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (DVR) AmeriCorps My Career Advancement Account (MyCAA) SallieMae Smart Option Student Loans Job Training Albuquerque (JTA) 8 The Future looks bright... In early 2020, UNMCE was poised to have one of its most financially successful year ever, with plans to upgrade technologies and infrastructure. And then the pandemic hit. Like most organizations, UNMCE had to adapt quickly to a very different and uncertain environment. UNMCE has the ability to pivot quickly and while revenues certainly took a dramatic hit, the upward trend remained. This past year, UNMCE achieved another new net revenue record - with over 1.5 million dollars in surplus revenue. This achievement is crucial to continue the path to upgrade technologies and infrastructure to create the high-quality learning environment and innovative programming. There is no doubt that recent inflation has a serious impact on UNMCE and its business model. It is imperative to keep program fees affordable and our programs accessible to the entire community. We continue to look for avenues for student funding of noncredit programs and local sponsors. In addition, we remain dedicated to constant business and process improvements that keep costs low and productivity and morale high. UNMCE has a strong, motivated, and diverse team, for which I am extremely grateful. The culture of UNMCE is highly collaborative and innovative. This cohesive team works together to define our processes, discover new opportunities, plan strategic initiatives, and implement tactics to achieve the UNMCE and the UNM mission and vision. UNMCE is on track to achieve next year's financial and program goals. In addition, UNMCE is currently poised to be a resource and partner to more departments that may benefit from UNMCE's expertise in the areas of noncredit students, New Mexico Job Market research, and administrative services. I am pleased to present this year's annual report in a new interactive format. Below you will find some highlights for UNMCE this past year as well as the start of an historic timeline. Finding historic information on UNMCE was certainly challenging. We believe this report will be useful to document challenges and achievements for years to come. As always, we welcome all suggestions in how we might improve our programs, our communication, and our service to the community.

As such, protecting freedom of expression is of central importance to the University. The exchange of diverse viewpoints may expose people to ideas some find offensive, even abhorrent. The way that ideas are expressed may cause discomfort to those who disagree with them. The appropriate response to such speech is speech expressing opposing ideas and continued dialogue, not curtailment of speech; \" and W HEREAS the Faculty Handbook Section B, Appendix I ( as revised 1990) incorporates the American Association of University Professors' (AAUP) 1940 statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure an d 1970 Interpretive Comments, noting: \"As citizens engaged in a profession that depends upon freedom for its health and integrity, 2 professors have a particular obligation to promote conditions of free inquiry and to further public understanding of academic freedom ;\" and WHEREAS the AAUP's statement On the Relationship of Faculty Governance to Academic Freedom ( 06-1994) noted that academic freedom of faculty members includes the freedom to express their views on academic matters in the classroom and in the conduct of research, having to with their institution and its policies, and in the interest of the general public even if their views are in conflict with others;\" and WHEREAS the Faculty Handbook Section B, Appendix I (as revised 1 990) recognizes U.S. Supreme Court jurisprudence stating: \"As the Supreme Court said in K eyishian v. Board of Regents , 385 U.S. 589 (1967): 'Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom, which is of transcendent value to all of us and no t merely to the teachers concerned. That freedom is therefore a special concern of the First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom;' \" and WHEREAS the Faculty Handbook at B.6.2.1(b) (12-07-98) provides: \"Academic freedom is defined in the 1940 Statement of Principles adopted by the American Association of University Professors and is the right of all members of the faculty and graduate students employed in teaching and research posit ions;\" and WHEREAS the faculty senate statement on Right to Free Speech & Assembly (12-20- 11) affirms that universities have historically been vibrant public spaces for political debate, civil protest, and intellectual discourse; and WHEREAS the faculty senate statement on Right to Free Speech & Assembly (12-20- 11) affirms that for democratic life to thrive and for society to flourish, political and intellectual dialogue must be forever protected and cultivated (Right to Free Speech & Assembly) ; and WHEREAS faculty have responsibility for the curriculum at their universities, as stated in AAUP's statement on Freedom in the Classrom at II.B.

In higher education, under principles of academic freedom that have been widely endorsed, professors are entitled to freedom in the classroom in discussing their subject. Educators, not politicians, should make decisions about teaching and learning;\" and WHEREAS the University's Mission Statement is to (1) \"Educate and encourage students to develop the values, habits of mind, knowledge and skills that they need to be enlightened citizens,\" (2) \"Discover and disseminate new knowledge and creative endeavors that will enhance the overall well -being of society\", and (3) \"Actively support social, cultural and economic development in our communities to enhance the quality of life for all New Mexicans;\" and WHEREAS several departments, committees, and groups at the University - including, for example the U NM Honors College (03-21), College of the University Libraries and Learning Sciences (7-07-20), History, School of Architecture and Planning (2-19-19), Diversity Committee of the College of Education and Human Sciences (6-10-20), Institute for the Study of Race and & Social Justice (2-1-22, Committee for Anti -Racist Education for the Center for Teaching and Learning, Art Museum (06-09-20), Chicana/o Studies and research faculty associated with the Southwest Hispanic Research Institute , Division of Equity and Inclusion (2021), Student Health and Counseling (6-05- 20), Black Faculty Alliance (05-20) and School of Law (06-20)- have issued statements affirming the importance of racial, gender, criminal, tribal, and social justice, diversity and inclusion, gender studies, Black studies, and Chicanx studies; and WHEREAS the Division for Equity and Inclusion's Diversity Statement affirms a commitment to \"deploy[s] justice, equity, accessibility, diversity, and inclusion (JEADI) resources to expand opportunity and cultivate potential of students, faculty, and staff at UNM by centering the community wealth of the peoples of New Mexico and beyond;\" and WHEREAS the University's Strategic Planning Framework UNM 2040: Opportunity Defined s tated objectives include being a force for social justice, addressing historical 4 and current injustices and inequities, and actively working to evolve cultural humility and literacy within our communities; WHEREAS the University's Strategic Planning Framework UNM 2040: Opportunity Defined s tated Vision is to: \"Be a global leader in realizing human potential, addressing critical community challenges, and demonstrating the power of inclusive diversity;\" and WHEREAS in a nation that has for centuries struggled with issues of racial inequity and injustice, many students do not have adequate knowledge of BIPOC and LGBTQI+ history, New Mexico history, and the policies that contributed to inequities and injustices, UNM has a responsibility and opportunity to help work toward equity and foster racial and social justice. Now therefore be it RESOLVED that the faculty senate resolutely rejects any attempts by bodies external to the faculty to restrict or dictate university curriculum on any matter, including matters related to racial and social justice, and will stand firm against encroachment on faculty authority by the state or federal legislature, or the Boards of Trustees or Board of Regents; and let it be further RESOLVED that faculty senate support the Joint Statement on Efforts to Restrict Education about Racism (6-16 -21), authored by the AAUP, PEN America, the American Historical Association, and the Association of American Colleges & Universities, endorsed by over 70 organizations; and let it be further RESOLVED that the UNM faculty senate supports the right of academics, regardless of contingent or permanent status, to have autonomy over the inclusion of racial and gender justice, and critical studies in curriculum and pedagogy; and let it be further RESOLVED that the faculty senate stands with our K -12 colleagues throughout the country and in New Mexico who are affected by similarly harmful legislation when they seek to teach the truth in U.S. history and civics education, and seek to be culturally and linguistically -responsive in their instruction and pedagogy; and let it be further RESOLVED that faculty senate calls upon the University President, the Provost, the Executive Vice President for UNM Health Sciences and Chief Executive Officer of the UNM Health System , and the UNM Board of Regents to reject any attempts by bodies external to the f aculty to restrict or dictate university curriculum on any matter, including matters related to gender, racial, and social justice, and critical studies; and let it be further RESOLVED that faculty senate calls upon University President, the Provost, the Executive Vice President for UNM Health Sciences and Chief Executive Officer of the UNM Health System , and the UNM Board of Regents to stand firm against encroachment on faculty authority by the state or federal legi slature or the Boards of Trustees or the Board of Regents; and let it be further 5 RESOLVED that faculty senate calls upon University President, the Provost, the Executive Vice President for UNM Health Sciences and Chief Executive Officer of the UNM Health System , and the UNM Board of Regents and the UNM Board of Regents to assure that the University permanently retains a campus climate conducive to intellectual dialogue on race, gender, justice, and critical studies; and let it be further RESOLVED that the faculty senate calls upon other representative bodies at the university, such as the Faculty Union UA -UNM , the Graduate and Professional Student Body Government , Associated Students at UNM , Latinx Faculty Alliance, Black Faculty Alliance, Native American Faculty Council, and Staff Council , to support this resolution.
