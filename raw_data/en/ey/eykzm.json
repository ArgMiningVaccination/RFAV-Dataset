In 2002 it pioneered the establishment a National Health Security Office (NHSO) to ensure universal health coverage for Thai people, including access to free, high -quality vaccines. A National Strategic Policy and Action Plan for Vaccine Security has been in place in Thailand since 2018 to ensure a sustainable supply of vaccines and support the domestic vaccine industry. Thaila nd's National Immunization Program was introduced in 1977 and has achieved high vaccine coverage rates (greater than 80 percent) over the past 20 years. The NIP schedule currently includes 12 vaccines, including for rotavirus, which was recently introduced in 2020. Domestic production meets the yearly requirement for BCG vaccine and accounts for 50 percent of seasonal influenza vaccine; all other vaccines for the NIP are imported. Procurement of NIP vaccines is overseen by the NHSO in partnership with Siraraj Hospital, while import and distribution is managed by the Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO), a public company. Thailand has four domestic vaccine manufacturers \u2014 one public, two public/private, and one private\u2014 all of which have upstream and downstream vaccine manufacturing capacity but in general lack full -spectrum production capacity. Thai vaccine manufacturers have prioritized building strong, collaborative relations hips with universities, biotech companies, laboratories and other vaccine manufacturers for technology transfer and capacity building. Thailand reported its first case of COVID -19 in January 2020 and its first death two months later. Rapidly - implemented p ublic health and social measures successfully controlled disease spread in the initial phase of the pandemic. Safe and efficacious COVID -19 vaccines, first produced in and delivered to the populations of high income countries, slowly became available in Th ailand in February 2021; by this time, the emergence of highly -transmissible variants had led to dramatic increases in COVID - 19 cases and deaths, sparking public unease about the Government's capacity to roll -out COVID -19 vaccines and the country's ability to produce them. Thailand's vaccine campaign proceeded slowly until September 2021, when locally - manufactured COVID -19 vaccines became available, leading to a sharp increase in vaccine coverage; by the end of 2022, three- fourths of the population had received two doses of vaccine. The procurement process for COVID -19 vaccines differs from that for NIP vaccines, as it is overseen by the National Vaccine Institute Thailand (NVI), Department of Diseases Control (DDC), and the MoPH committee for private purchase of vaccine, with DDC responsible for distribution. Universities and laboratories in Thailand have a long history of vaccine R&D, including for tropical diseases (i.e. dengue) and pandemic influenza, but the COVID -19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented level of interest in vaccine development among stakeholders and policy makers. Two university -based vaccine research centers along with the NVI and the four domestic vaccine manufacturers are working on COVID -19 vaccine R&D projects using different technology platforms, with several candidate vaccines in the final stage of clinical trials. The emphasis on COVID -19 vaccine R&D has led to reduced prioritization of R&D for tropical and/or endemic disease vaccines, though the vaccine industry is sufficiently dy namic to accommodate a broadened focus going forward. In terms of COVID -19 vaccine production, Siam Bioscience Thailand, a public/private entity, is producing AstraZeneca COVID -19 vaccine via a technology transfer contract initiated in 2020 with AstraZenec a UK. The vaccine is distributed in Thailand, ASEAN countries, and globally. 6 The National Regulatory Authority in Thailand achieved WHO Maturity Level 3 in 2021, demonstrating the presence of systems that ensure the safety of vaccines produced and used in the country. Manufacturers and stakeholders interviewed for this study reported that substantial financial and human resource investments must be made in order for vaccine R&D, manufacturing and regulatory systems to keep pace with the Government's goals for vaccine security. Stakeholders reported additional challenges as well, including limited dialogue between vaccine manufacturers and vaccine security stakeholders that undermines long- term planning efforts, barriers in access to financing among public institutions that causes delays in infrastructure improvement initiatives, and a lack of transparency in Government -led initiatives, which has eroded public and private sector trust in Government institutions. Thailand has a dynamic vaccine R&D environment in which strong partnerships exist between the public and private sector and the vaccine manufacturing industry plays an active role. 7 Introduction COVID -19 has had a devastating effect on the ASEAN region, which has recorded over 27 million cases of the virus. Access to COVID -19 vaccination has significantly reduced the spread of the disease and limited the number of severe COVID -19 cases, but it has also impacted routine immunization coverage. Count less strategies have been developed to ensure vaccine equity , which were swiftly translated from political assessment to practical action; however, they failed to address the sustained growth of the COVID -19 pandemic and the emergence of variant s of concerns, requiring ongoing vaccine booster doses. The pandemic revealed weaknesses in ASEAN's regional vaccine capacity, including in research and development, manufacturing infrastructure and human resources, which made the region particularly vulnerable durin g COVID -19 surges, as it was highly dependent on vaccine imports. Despite the existence of an established framework for ASEAN collaboration on vaccines, there has been minimal coordination between member states to collectively procure COVID - 19 vaccines. In itial consultations with various stakeholders involved in vaccination and equitable access in the ASEAN region highlighted several gaps related to ensuring a sustained supply of quality vaccines throughout the life cycle, as well as several critical areas that require immediate attention. The political commitment to address these issues has been shaped by the evolving pandemic scenarios. The ASEAN Vaccine Security and Self -Reliance (AVSSR) initiative was launched just before the COVID -19 pandemic began and was agreed upon and endorsed by the region's ten leaders during the 34th ASEAN Summit in November, 2019. Future regional strategies, policies and plans must ensure consistency with this important ASEAN initiative. To accelerate the sustainability of regio nal vaccine capacity in accordance with the AVSSR milestone (2021 -2025), ASEAN should collaborate with development partners who can offer adequate levels of manufacturing expertise, market analysis, financial capability, and technical assistance, including global players like WHO, UNICEF, and World Bank, among others. Moreover, the ASEAN alliance is committed to assisting ASEAN members in fighting pandemics and facilitating recovery from economic instability, particularly by advancing vaccine research and development and building manufacturing capacity. To optimize this favorable environment, ASEAN member states now need to share and collectively discuss their challenges, competencies, and actual capabilities in the vaccine and biopharmaceutica l areas to find the best way s to achieve the goal of regional vaccine security and self -reliance in vaccine research , development and manufacturing. In addition, the nations should work to identify pooled procurement mechanisms \u2014especially for non -vaccine -producing middle income countries (MICs) that have limited access to donor funding and procurement facilities like UNICEF and COVAX \u2014to enable them to bid for larger vaccine volume, thus strengthening negotiating power for affordable vaccine prices, for example for PCV and HPV vaccines which are the most expensive among NIP vaccines and are produced by few manufacturers . While some evidence on regional vaccine manufacturing capacity for ASEAN exists, there has been limited research on the technical, operati onal, financing and strategic partnership opportunities that exist in the region and might be leveraged to advance regional vaccine security. To address this knowledge gap, the ASEAN Vaccine Development and Manufacturing Research Project was initiated by t he UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (UK FCDO), the World Bank, International Finance Corporation, and Global Financing Facility 8 for Women, Children and Adolescents. This project complements the AVSSR Initiative and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) 2021 plan, and supports the November 2019 declaration of ASEAN leaders on regional vaccine security and self -reliance. Value Addition of the Project This regional analytical activity will contribute to knowledge on the te chnical, operational, and financial viability of and strategic partnership s required among ASEAN countries to strengthen coordinated investments in the vaccine value chain. Five ASEAN members states \u2014Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam \u2014were engaged to conduct detailed analyses of their country's current vaccine system, including current processes related to procurement and distribution, manufacturing capabilities (current or potential), and regulatory systems related to domestic vaccine registration , qualit y and safety oversight of production , and post- marketing surveillance . The country teams also consulted with high - level stakeholders from government, regulatory agencies, academia, private sector and civil society to identify r elative strengths and critical weaknesses in each country's technical and human resource capacity to respond to vaccine manufacturing needs in the future. This document is the deep dive into Thailand's capacity for vaccine R&D and production. Thailand Country Profile Brief Country Context Among Upper Middle Income Countries (UMIC) around the world, Thailand is recognized for its strong health care system. The country was ranked fifth globally and first in Asia on the Global Health Security Index in De cember 2021 (Bell and Nuzzo, 2021) . In the region, Thailand pioneered the establishment of a National Health Security Office (NHSO) in 2002 to ensure universal health coverage (UHC), which includes a national strategic policy and action plan for vaccine se curity in which all Thai people have equal access to quality vaccines at no cost to the patient. Th ailand has a National Vaccine Committee (NVC), which was established by the National Vaccine Security Act of 2018 ; it is chaired by the Prime Minister, vice -chaired by the Minister of Health, and includes representatives from government agencies and experts in related fields. The NVC established the National S trategic Policy and Action Plan for Vaccine Security , which has four major objectives: 1. to improve the effective management system for a sustainable supplies of vaccines ; 2. to support networking on vaccine research and development, production, and regulatory control; 3. to enhance and strengthen the domestic vaccine industry in all aspects, from research and dev elopment to marketing ; 4. to support vaccine -related resource management, including human resource development, knowledge transfer, financing of infrastructure, and enhanced networking. 9 Figure 1. Thailand age pyramid, 2020 Source: World Bank Open Data Thailand is a country with a land area of 510,890 square kilometers , of which 93 percent is rural (2010). The country shares borders with Myanmar, Laos , Cambodia and Malaysia. Thailand has a total population of just under 70 million inhabitants , the fourth -largest among ASEAN member states. It has an annual population growth rate of 0.3 percent with a near even division between males and females in the population. The age pyramid is shown in Figure 1. Thailand is divided into five regions \u2014the ci ty of Bangkok plus the Central, Northern, Northeastern, and Southern region s\u2014and 77 provinces, 928 districts, 7,425 subdistricts, and 74,948 villages. Nearly sixty percent of the population lives in the Northeastern and Central regions (32 percent and 25 percent, respectively). Bangkok is the largest city in Thailand with 6 million inhabitants; slightly more than one -third of the population lives in urb an areas. Burden of Disease Among the Thai P opulation In 2019, the World Bank reported that 77 percent of deaths in Thailand were attributable to non -communicable diseases , including: ischemic heart disease (leading cause of death), stroke , chronic kidney disease , and a number of cancers (IHME, n.d).1 That same year, among diseases under surveillance, the highest morbidity rate was reported for acute diarrhea, while acute respiratory infections ranked third (influenza) and fourth (pneumonia) (Table 1). The mortality rates for these two diseases were also among 1 Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Thailand country profile page. 10% 5% 0% nationally: pneumonia had a mortality rate 0.350 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2019, while influenza had a mortality rate of 0.042 per 100,00 0 inhabitants (Table 2) .

Top 10 disease mortality rates in Thailand, 2019 Source: MoPH Epidemiological Surveillance Report , 2019 Burden of disease for children under 5 years old In the twenty year period between 1990 and 2019, the mortality rate for children under 5 fell by a factor of 2.5, from 22 deaths per 1,000 population to 8.7. The leading causes of death among children under five in 2019 were perinatal ; lower respiratory infections ranked fourth among children in this age group2 (Figure 2). In 2010, the Bureau of Epidemiology reported that pneumonia -associated morbidity rates among children under 5 years of age decreased from 5.6 percent to 1.6 percent from 1993 to 2009 ; likewise mortality rates decreased from 9.57 to 1.74 per 100,000 population in that same period, achieving national targets for bot h 2 Our World in Data . https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/causes -of-death -in-children -under -5?country=~THA Diseases Cases Deaths pop.) 1.

However, substantial underreporting was acknowledged as data was pulled exclusively from public sector health care facilities. Pneumonia- associated morbidity and mortality among Thai children has decreased dramatically since the turn of the millennia thanks to improved surveillance and case management and the introduction of the Hib vaccine in 20193; nonetheless, among cases of lower respiratory infection, pneumonia represents a significant proportion of hospital admissions and deaths among young children. Source: Our World in Data In 2019, UNICEF reported that 0.9 percent of Thai children under the age of five died as a result of diarrheal diseases. Studies conducted in Thailand have shown that 43 to 56 percent of diarrhea- related hospital admissions among children under five are due to Rotavirus infection (Jiraphongsa et al., 2005; Sutra et al., 2012) . These studies, along with further disease burden assessments and cost benefit analyses, led the Government in 2020 to introduce the Rotavirus vaccine into the national immunization sc hedule. COVID -19 Pandemic in Thailand Thailand was the first country in ASEAN \u2014and the first outside of China \u2014to report a case of COVID -19 in January 2020; it was also the first to report a death two months later. In the absence of a vaccine in the early stage of the pandemic, and to control the spread of the virus , the Government of Thailand promptly issued strong community- based contact tracing and Public Health and Social Measures (PHSM). A state of emergency wa s declared on March 26, 2020 until May of that year, though it was later extended through the end of July. The Center for COVID -19 Situation Administration (CCSA) was established on March 16, 2020. Under the leadership of the Prime Minister, it is charged with leading the country in the fight against COVID -19 and coordinating and reporting on the implementation of control measures , which have includ ed: a ban on foreigners entering the country, a mandatory 14 - day quarantine for any travelers entering Thaila nd, and the restriction of mass gathering s and travelling between provinces. All public venues were closed in Bangkok from April 2020 ; beginning in May, all schools were closed except for international private schools , and the start of the new academic year was postponed until July 2020. 3 WHO New and Underutilized Vaccine Introduction , Thailand . https://immunizationdata.who.int/pages/indicators -b y- category/new_and_under_utilized_vaccines_introduction.html?ISO_3_CODE=THA&YEAR= Figure 2.

Source: World Bank Open Data As described, PHSM measures were critical in the early stage of the pandemic to contain the spread of the disease. From January to May 2021, five COVID -19 vaccines were given TFDA approval for emergency use (Box 1) , allowing the Ministry of Public Health ( MoPH) to begin a mass vaccination campaign ; other COVID -19 vaccines were subsequently registered , with detailed information available on the Thai Food and Drugs Administration (TFDA) website4. Deliveries of COVID -19 vaccine began arriving in Thailand in F ebruary 2021 , enabling MoPH to initiate vaccination of priority groups including frontline HCWs in the public and private sector, individuals over 60 years of age, individuals with underlying conditions, and officials involved in disease control whose line of work involved contact w ith confirmed cases. SINOVAC vaccine was used at first, followed by imported Astra Zeneca and later locally - manufactured Astra Zeneca vaccine when Siam Bioscience received TFDA approval. 4 Information about vaccines approved for use in Thailand can be found on the T hai Fo od and Drug Administration, Medicines Regulation Division website at https://www.fda.moph.go.th/sites/drug/SitePages/Vaccine_SPC -Name.aspx Box 1.

National COVID -19 vaccination coverage COVID -19 vaccine coverage ramped up starting in June 2021 for all ASEAN countries. Because it had access to locally -manufactured vaccine, Thailand saw a sharp increase in vaccine coverage from September 2021 (14 percent) to December 2021 (61 percent) (Figu re 4). In Thailand, the combination of PHSM and increasing vaccination rates enabled the country to control the number of new infections and avoid overloading hospitals and ICUs with severe cases despite several waves of infection due to emerging v ariants of concern (Figure 5). As of early May 2022, the total cumulative number of reported COVID -19 cases in Thailand wa s 4.29 million with nearly 29,000 deaths (Figure 7). Source: Thailand Center for COVID -19 Situation Administration (CCSA). https://www.thaigov.go.th/news/contents/details/29299 The Government of Thailand has expanded vaccine eligibility and added booster doses to the immunization schedule as supply has become available . The TFDA authorized the use of Pfizer -BioNTech mRNA pediatric formulation for children ages 5-11 in January 2022; it has also provided COVID -19 vaccination to the estimated 2.9 million migrant workers who live in Thailand (International Labour Organization , 2019). Despite these efforts, regional variation in coverage rates is evident, with the rate of two -dose vaccination ranging from 45 percent in some rural areas to nearly 100 percent in Bangkok.

COVID -19 Source: Thailand CCSA . https://www.thaigov.go.th/news/contents/details/29299 Source: WHO Thailand, 2022. Among the numerous challenges of vaccinating against COVID -19 has been the use of multiple vaccines with different technological platforms, which have had to be wisely combined to ensure the highest level of protection. MoPH issued detailed guidelines for the vaccination of 5 -17 year olds including recommended vaccines for booster doses; similar guidance was given for adults. These recommendations are displayed below in Figure s 8 and 9. Figure 6. Thailand COVID -19 cases, deaths and vaccinations Figure 7. COVID -19 deaths in Thailand 15 Figure 8. COVID -19 vaccination program for children and a dolescents Source: MoPH Press Briefing 21 March 2022 Source: MoPH Press Briefing 21 March 2022 Summ ary of the National Immunization Program The National Immunization Program (NIP) was introduced in Thailand in 1977. It has a long history of high immunization coverage rates, achieving greater than 80 percent coverage for more than twenty years. The coverage of essential health services in Thailand is among the highest in the region at 83 percent, though studies show that there are pockets of low immunization coverage, especially among children of migrant workers (Pinna et al., 2020) and in some provinces in the Southern region (UNICEF, 2021) . In Thailand, immunization Figure 9. MoPH guidelines for COVID -19 vaccine administration 16 services are provided free of charge through a network of 9,800 health promotion hospitals and primary health care facilities as well as 771 community hospitals that provide secondary health services \u2014including vaccinations \u2014at the di strict level. The private sector provides immunization services as well: at the provincial level, 10 -15 percent of all vaccinations are given by private sector providers, while in Bangkok the percentage is closer to 30 percent. Immunization services are f inanced by the National Health Insurance Plan (NHIP), which was established in 2002. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP ) was established in 1970 to advise MoPH on vaccine priorities, new introductions and the recommended vaccination sch edule ; in 2001 it was integrated into the National Vaccine Committee to form the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (Rattanavipapong et al., 2020) , which continues to advise the MOPH on vaccine introductions and practices. MoPH introduces a new vaccine into the NIP once TFDA provides regulatory approval. The Thai government's measures to fight COVID -19 enabled the country to control the spread of the diseases and rapidly reduce the COVID -19 case fatality rate while having a limited impact on chi ldhood immunization coverage, which is a remarkable achievement. Though DTP 3 vaccination coverage decreased slightly from 99 percent in 2017 to 97 percent in 2021, and measles 2nd dose coverage \u2014given to children at two -and-a-half years of age \u2014 decreased by 10 percent in 2021, coverage rates remained well higher than among other countries in the ASEAN region. Additional information on Thailand NIP performance indicators is included in Annex 1. Vaccines Included in the NIP Thail and's immunization schedule currently includes 12 vaccines to be administrated to different age groups (Table 3). Several new and underutilized vaccines were recently introduced into the immunization program , including : rotavirus vaccine in 2020, pentavale nt DPT-HepB -Hib vaccine in 2019, HPV vaccine in 2017, and the seasonal influenza vaccine in 2008 (WHO, n.d. -b)5. Thailand is the only country among ASEAN member states that has introduced seasonal influenza vaccine into the NIP. Table 3.

Vaccine Delivery Challenges and Inequities Since the inception of the NIP in Thailand, the vaccine supply chain system has gone through several reforms. Prior to 2002, the pharmacy unit within the Bureau of General Communicable Diseases in MOPH was in charge of budgeting, procuring and distributing vaccines. Following health care reform in 2002, the budget for NIP vaccines was based on the capitat ion payment under the universal health coverage scheme managed by NHSO , which was established th at same year. In 2009, the NHSO and the Department of Diseases Control (DDC) in MoPH launched a pilot project to outsource vaccine supply management to the Gove rnment Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO). The project was successful, and since 2010, NHSO has been in charge of the vaccine procurement process while GPO imports and distributes the vaccine in the country. To monitor vaccine distribution, GPO introduced and manages a vendor -managed inventory system (VMI) (PATH, 2011) . Although it is a vaccine -producing country, Thailand imports most of the vaccines for the NIP. In 2017- 18, the country procured a total of 33.6 million doses of vaccine for the NIP , 19 percent of which were locally -produced. Domestic vaccine production meets the yearly requirements for BCG ; domestic production also accounted for nearly 50 percent of seasonal influenza vaccine procured in 2017 and 20 percent in 2018. In 2017, the MoPH reported a total vaccine procurement expenditure of US$41.82 million; in 2018, the total expenditure was approximately USD 56 million6. The difference in budget spending between 2017 and 2018 may be due to late purchase of vaccine s for use in the following year; an analysis of vaccine spending for three consecutive years would provide more details, but data is not available . Thailand is an upper -middle income country and as such has limited access to donor funding; it must fully finance vaccine procurement for NIP , including the COVID -19 vaccine. Thailand did not join the COVAX facility. The uninterrupted supply of vaccine is the cornerstone of NIP efforts to r each and maintain high immunization coverage. However, studies have shown that vaccine shortages occur in many countries, including MICs. The Global Vaccine Action Plan (2011 -2020) targeted a two - thirds reduction in the number of countries reporting nation al-level vaccine stock- outs by 2020 (WHO, 2013) . According to WHO/UNICEF Joint Reporting Form data, vaccine shortages 6 WHO Immunization Expenditure, Thailand page. Available online at: https://immunizationdata.who.int/pages/indicators -by- category/finance.html?ISO_3_CODE=THA&YEAR = 18 occurred in Thailand on two separate occasions: for HPV vaccine in 2018 and 2019, and for measles -containing vaccine (MMR) in 2019. An a nalysis of vaccine stock -outs for the period 2011 -2015 showed that 39 percent of stock - outs globally were attributable to a government funding delay (Lydon et al., 2017) . Though no analysis was conducted in Thailand on the causes of the HPV and MMR shortages of 2018 and 2019, the country could consider establishing multi -year procurement agreements with manufacturers as a general strategy to ensure adequate vaccine supply . The establishment of such long -term agreements may require policy changes , however, as the current government financial rules do not allow for funding commitments beyond the duration of the fiscal year. Procurement delay s can also result from incorrect vaccine specification s in bid document s, which Thailand experienced in 2019. A delay of this nature may highlight a lack of interagency collaboration among TFDA and other involved parties during the pre paration of marketing authorization documents and product specifications . Adverse Event s Following Immunization and Pharmacovigilance System Another important element of achieving and maintaining high immunization coverage is the capacity of the NIP to detect, manage, report and investigate Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI). Strong post- marketing vaccine safety surveillance enables the program to build public confidence in immunization and to mitigate safety concerns when serious AEFIs are reported in the media. The National AEFI Experts R eview Committee was established in Thailand in 2004 by MoPH/DDC decree 166/2547; sub -national AEFI committees were established throughout the country between 2010 and 2013. The National AEFI guideline was revised in 2019 and is now on the 5th edition. The AEFI surveillance system is integrated in the Health Product Vigilance Center (HPVC) with in the Thai Food and Drugs Administration (TFDA). The AEFI system in Thailand was recognized as high -performing during the 2019 South -East Asia Regional workshop on inter -country expert review of selected AEFI cases (MacDonald et al., 2020) . The AEFI monitoring system for COVID -19 vaccines is strongly anchored in the routine vaccine safety surveillance system while also respon sive to COVID -19-specific requirements. In the beginning of the pandemic, WHO provided advice to COVAX on vaccine efficacy and safety of products listed in EUL for one year only, due to the lack of post- marketing safety data ; TFDA provided COV ID-19 vaccine regulatory approval for one year as well. The decision to extend regulatory approval is based on a reassessment of vaccine products once additional post -marketing safety and efficacy data becomes available, including among people with comorbidities, pregnant women, and younger or older age groups not usually included in clinical trial (CT) population samples. All NRAs including the EMA and USFDA granted one - year regulatory approval under emergency use based on clinical trial phase 3 data and r isk- benefit analysis. To continuously monitor the safety profile of a vaccine , it is essential to have strong, collaborative mechanisms between NIP, MoPH and DDC, the Department of Epidemiology, TFDA , and manufacturers to update vaccine safety information, especially for the COVID -19 vaccine with which large swaths of the population were vaccinated in a short period of time. The relief of having a COVID -19 vaccine was tempered by false allegations of v accine safety 19 shared by the media and in social networks, making it even more essential to continuously monitor and communicate safety and efficacy data. Strengthening collaboration among ASEAN vaccine safety specialists would help to scientifically docume nt and inform the public about vaccine safety, but this has not yet happen ed due to limited collaboration within ASEAN countries and with the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS). Additionally, regional collaboration could provide additi onal expertise and help to reinforce the findings of AEFI causality assessments conducted by the Thailand AEFI committees and others ASEAN counterparts. NVI's leadership role in the AVSSR could position it to spearhead a collaborative mechanism for ASEAN vaccine causality experts to rev iew selected cases when necessary (e.g. during outbreaks or pandemic situations) with inputs from the WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS). Vaccine Regulatory System The Thai Food and Drugs Administration (TFDA) within MoPH is the National Regulatory Agency in Thailand . Within TFDA, the Bureau of Drug Control manages the regulatory system, market authorization, market control and surveillance, licensing of products , regulatory inspection and clinical trials authorization, and monitoring and data analysis , while the Technical and Planning Division undertakes the pharmacovigilance function . TFDA is supported by two other departments in MoPH: the Department of Medical Sciences ( within the Institute of Biological Products) , which is the National Control Laboratory (NCL) for laboratory access and lot release functions ; and the Department of Disease Control ( within the Bureau of Epidemiology) for the detect ion and investigat ion of AEFI cases including causality assessment conducted by an expert group . The TFDA is funded by the g overnment based on the Annual Expenditure Budget Act and fees collected according to the Order of the Head of the National Council for Peace and Ord er No.77/2559. In June 2018, the WHO conducted a formal review of the TFDA regulatory system using the standard Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT ). The GBT is globally recognized as a standard tool for NRA benchmarking ; it is comprised of 280 indicators and sub -indicators (below) developed over several years of extensive consultations with NRAs in HICs, MICs and LICs. 1. Regulatory system with 62 sub -indicators; 2. Registration and market authorization with 31 sub -indicators; 3. Pharmacovigilance with 25 sub -indicators; 4. Market surveillance and control with 26 sub -indicators; 5. Licensing of pr emises with 20 sub -indicators; 6. Regulatory inspections with 29 sub -indicators; 7. Laboratory access and testing with 34 sub -indictors; 8. Clinical trial oversight with 30 sub -indicators 9. Lot release with 23 sub -indicators WHO benchmarking of the TFDA was conducted with regulatory experts from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Australia, the National Agency for Drugs and Food 20 Control (NADFC) Indonesia, the Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco (AIFA) Italy, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CEBER), United States Food and Drugs Administration, the medicine evaluation board in the Netherlands, and experts from WHO. The status of the TFDA benchmarking is summarized in Table 4. Table 4. TFDA status as of June 2018 Key features of the TFDA Reported data 1. Types of health products and / or technologies regulated by the National Regulatory Authority (NRA) according to available national legislation Human, veterinary and traditional medicines 2.

In vaccine producing countries, the NRA GBT is used to assess the maturity level of the regulatory system; a maturity level of 3 or above enables manufacturers to submit vaccines for WHO pre -qualification. The vaccine regulatory performance findings in Thailand identified four regulatory functions with a m aturity level score below 3: registration and marketing authorization (ML 1); licensing of premises (ML 1); clinical trial oversight (ML 1); and pharmacovigilance and regulatory inspection (ML 2). The highest score (ML 4) was reported for the laboratory ac cess and testing function . The major issues found during the assessment included: 1. Parallel structures/units (market authorization and registration) Inconsistency in process and outcome (different staff and advisory committees as well as competency of reviewers) Inadequate internal communication and transparency Inadequate QMS coverage Human resources Imbalance between fixed term and temporary staff Use of too many external experts Inadequate systematic and needs driven training program 2. Enforcement Lengthy and time consuming processes Hierarchical and involvement of many layers Exclusion of public sector in some areas 21 3. Performance measurement Some KPIs are not able to pr operly measure the performance of regulatory functions. KPIs should b e considered as tools to measure and improve the performance of regulatory functions. 4. Enforcement of regulatory oversight on distribution channels 5. Inadequate communication and transparency with regards to regulatory oversight on clinical trials 6. Regulator y preparedness to address crises: lack of a comprehensive crisis management system that is supported by legal framework and regulatory processes In countries that produce WHO pre -qualified vaccines, WHO does not assign a maturity level immediately after completion of the assessment; i nstead, it allows four to six months for the NRA to implement the Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) plan. In T hailand, WHO monitored progress on implementing CAPA measures through regular communications with the TFDA, and in June 2021 it officially granted an overall maturity level 3 to the TFDA. In doing so, vaccine manufacturer GPO -MBP was able to keep the JE -LAV (IMOJEV- MD) vaccine in the list of WHO pre -qualified vaccines (WHO, 2021) . The TFDA is built on several strengths, including the ability to select and recruit staff with a high level of relevant knowledge. A website is maintained in Thai and in English that provides a significant amount of information to external stakeholders regarding TFDA activities7. Additionally, Thailand has a well-established Quality Management System that obtained ISO 9001:2015 certi fication in January 2018. The TFDA is funded by the g overnment to implement all regulatory functions, however , the budget allocation for the Bureau of Drug Control (12.2 percent of the total TFDA budget, which was US$26 million for 2018) is considered insu fficient to effectively and efficiently perform all regulatory activities. Fees and charges were introduced in 2017 to recoup some regulatory costs, but this is not enough for a country with plans to invest in vaccine production. Protocol for R egistering New Vaccines Thailand's market ing authorization (MA) function and its legal framework are laid out in Chapter 10, Section 79 of Drug Act B.E. 2510. Ministerial Ordinance No 18 B.E. 2525, issued under Drug Act B.E.2510, defines the legal provisions and regul ations related to MA activities ; the application form and credential certificate of drug registration are listed under the Ministerial Notification. TFDA notification B.E 2551 provides defin itions for type of marketing authorization, CTD format according to the International Consortium on Harmonization (ICH) , and CTD format according to ASEAN Pharmaceutical Harmonization on Registration for modern medicines , referred as ASEAN CTD (ACTD) . The TFDA has implemented the ACTD , though its requirement s are just a minimum standard for submission of medicinal products of different categories ; the licensing of biological s and vaccine s requires additional information that is listed in the full package of ACTD or ICH CTD. 7 Vaccine information for Thailand can be found at: https://www.fda.moph.go.th/sites/drug/SitePages/Vaccine.aspx 22 The authority and independence of the TFD A was challenged in the early days of the COVID - 19 pandemic, as the usual mechanisms for granting marketing authorization were overruled in an effort to vaccinate citizens as quickly as possible. This situation was not unique to Thailand but nonetheless hi ghlighted a lack of transparency in the Government decision - making process. Domestic V accine Manufacturing and Distribution Capacit y Thailand has four domestic vaccine manufacturers: one in the public sector (QSMI) , two public/private manufacturers (Siam Bioscience; GPO -MBP) , and one in the private sector (BioNet Asia) . Although all four have upstream and downstream capacity, few products are fully manufactured in Thailand, and the vaccines in the companies' portfolios include many imported vaccines, either as bulk product to be formulated in Thailand , or as finished product ready for distribution. A complete listing of manufacturers' current R&D projects and vaccine port folios is summarized in Table 5. The overall production capacity of three of the vaccine manufacturers \u2014BioNet Asia, GPO - MBP and QSMI \u2014is generally limited and/or insufficient to meet NIP vaccine requirements , though QSM I produces sufficient BCG vaccine to meet demand for the NIP . GPO -MBP produces seasonal influenza vaccine that is supplied to the NIP, though not the full amount that is required each year. The remaining vaccine doses required for the NIP are imported and distributed by GPO as part of the NHSO contractual arrangement for NIP imported vaccines. Table 5.

Siam Bioscience , a private/public sector company, is one of 25 companies selected by AstraZeneca to license its C OVID -19 viral vector vaccine. Siam Bioscience is a biopharmaceuticals manufacturer founded in 2009 through the King's Fund, which was set up by the Late King Rama IX to improve health and wellbeing. AstraZeneca audited Siam Bioscience during Q2 of 2020. Currently, there is no ongoing collaboration for Vaccine R&D and production. Siam Bioscience produces Astra Zeneca ChAdOx1-S/nCoV -19 recombinant vaccine through a technology transfer initiated in 2020 with AstraZeneca UK. Siam Bioscience Co. operates as Contracting Upstream and downstream production processes. End -to-end manufacturing takes around 120 days to complete each drug substance lot. Drug product lots are converted from drug substance daily 25 Company Highlights of collaboration with manufacturers, universities and R&D institutes Upstream/downstream vaccine production Other va ccine products Partners and business model Management Organization (CMO) producing vaccine upon the request of Astra Zeneca Thailand. Astra Zeneca Thailand places orders with Siam Bioscience to produce the vaccine. The vaccine is then dispatched according to Astra Zeneca distribution plans with output of 700,000 doses per day. Siam Bioscience is producing 200 million doses of Astra Zeneca vaccine per year . The overall contract is for 200m doses to supply to Thailand, ASEAN countries, and the Maldives. TFDA is a member of PIC/S and all vaccine manufacturers in Thailand comply with GMP PIC/S9 and international standards. In addition, GMP compliance in the GPO -MBP facility is periodically reviewed by WHO in order for the JE LAV IMOJEV vaccine to remain on the list of WHO pre-qualified products. GPO -MBP is also marketing the JE LAV vaccine in Hong Kong, Macau, South Korea, Taiwan and other countries within the ASEAN. Several BioNet Asia vaccines received EU market approval and approval in other Southeast Asian countries \u2014 including Singapore and Australia \u2014both of which have stringent regulatory systems. All Thai vaccine manufacturers have high standards for quality assurance/quality control and GMP compliance, and with the TFDA at Maturity Level 3, vaccines manufactured in Thailand are of assured quality. Except for Siam Bioscience which exclusively produc es Astra Zeneca COVID -19 vaccine , Thailand's vaccine manufacturers have extensive experience in vaccine R&D, as reported in the MoPH/NVI ASEAN Baseline Vaccine Survey (ASEAN Secretariat, 2019) . This experience has positioned them to undertake R&D to develop locally- engineered COVID -19 vaccines. There are currently seven ongoing R&D projects for COVID -19 vaccine in Thailand, several in early pre -clinical stages and one in clinical trial phase 3. These projects have benefited from effective public/private collaboration in particular with Chulalongkorn and Mahidol Universities , which are involved in most of the projects . The National Vaccine Institute in MoPH plays a key role in coordinating vaccine R&D, collaborating in clinical trials, and reviewing public sector company proposals for technology transfer. Both Siam Bioscience and BioNet Asia operate as Contract (Development and) Manufacturing Organizations (CDMO/CMO). Siam Bioscience is currently under contract with Astra Zeneca UK to produce its COVID -19 vacci ne. Astra Zeneca Thailand provides the manufacturer with purchase orders (PO), and once the vaccine is produced, Siam Bioscience delivers it to Astra Zeneca Thailand which in turn delivers the vaccine to the MoPH, countries within and outside Asia, and to international procurement agencies like UNICEF and PAHO. Under the current contractual arrangement, Siam Bioscience does not participate in discussions around vaccine allocations and does not have ongoing R&D projects, although the company submitted an EOI to WHO to acquire mR NA technology. 9 PIC/S is the acronym used to describe both the Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention (PIC) and the pharmaceutical Inspection C o- operation Scheme (PIC Scheme) operating together in parallel. The Pharmaceutical Inspection Co -operation Scheme (PIC/S ) is a non -binding, informal co -operative arrangement between Regulatory Authorities in the field of Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) of medicinal products for human or veterinary use. PIC/S aims at harmonizing inspection procedures worldwide by developing common standards in the field of GMP and by providing training opportunities to Inspectors. 26 BioNet Asia operates as a Contract Development Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) and is currently supporting several collaborations with various manufacturers to develop vaccines and upgrade their production facilities. BioNet Asia is a leading member of an R&D consortium composed of universities from the US and Thailand as well as the International Vaccine Institute in South Korea . Within the consortium, BioNet Asia provides engineering know -how and produces clinical trial vaccine batches of virus like particles (VLP) forming multivalent mRNA vaccine . The company has also been operating as a consulting company to provide technical support and technology access to several vaccine manufacturers in the region, including Bio Farma in Indonesia, Serum Institute of India (SII), and Panacea and Bharat (both in India) around the production and formulation of oral polio and pentavalent vaccines. In addition, BioNet provides emerging vaccine manufacturers with network ac cess to technologies, sources of bulk materials, manufacturing capacities and supply platforms with the goal of production self -sufficiency and maximizing existing idle vaccine capacities . Vaccine Manufacturing Challenges All four vaccine manufacturers report difficulties procuring excipients and ingredients to manufacture vaccines as well as disposable items for vaccine production, such as bioreactor filters. All raw materials and items are imported from the US and EU except for vaccine vials , which some manufacturers report procur ing from a supplier in Indonesia. The scale of difficulty to procure raw materials and disposable items depends on the annual volume of vaccine produced by the manufacturer. Siam Bioscience, with the large st quantity of vaccine doses manufactured, reported that vaccine production requires not less than 200 ingredients, bio -process materials and other disposable supplies to complete formulation an d manufacturing. Many of these ingredients have specific suppl y chain requirements, and with many vaccine manufacturers competing simultaneously to procure these products, the supply is not assured. This high global demand with limited suppliers puts a substantial strain on the supply chain. Siam Bioscience identifie s the \"supply strain\" as the main threat to its current Astra Zeneca vaccine production efforts in Thailand. BioNet Asia procures excipients and ingredients in large quantities to sustain vaccine manufacture for several months; however, this strategy requires substantial storage capacity, which is costly. The other two manufacturers import vaccine in bulk, which is then formulated and bottled; with less quantity of vaccine produced upstream and downstream, these smaller vaccine manufactures face fewer diffi culties in procuring excipients, ingredients and disposable materials. BioNet Asia, QSMI, GPO and Siam Bioscience are members of the Developing Country Vaccine Manufacturers Network (DCVMN); the collaborative enterprise between GPO and MBP (GPO -MBP) is not a member of the network. Vaccine manufacturers in Thailand acknowledge the usefulness of trainings organized by DCVMN , for example on quality control, self -audit and bio -setting, and recognize DCVMN as a reliable source of knowledge and information exchan ge among manufacturers. However, several manufacturers suggested that DCVMN could go beyond knowledge exchange into practical collaboration ( i.e. learning by doing) and help to facilitate partnerships for R&D and production. 27 In general, vaccine industry stakeholders expressed a lack of collaboration within the ASEAN , although ASEAN leaders have talked for many years about strengthening partnerships. For example, the harmonization of regulatory pathways for vaccines among the ASEAN countries has not yet resulted in a comprehensive market authorization procedure common to all ASEAN countries. SWOT Analysis: Thailand's contribution to the vaccine value chain in ASEAN Strengths Weaknesses Good collaboration between public & private sectors with strong participation of universities in vaccine R&D. Manufacturers are very active in vaccine R&D for COVID -19 vaccine and other vaccines e.g.: chikungunya , HPV, Dengue, JE Chimeric vaccine. Production of novel vaccine e.g. recombinant acellular pertussis (B ioNet Asia) and COVID- 19 subunit with novel approach and technology using plants . Vaccine manufacturing is in compliance with stringent regulatory requirements for QA/QC and GMP. Vaccine production capacity for pandemic influenza is available . Production of WHO p re-qualified vaccine (JE LAV). Upstream vaccine production is limited with only two vaccines manufactured in Thailand being used in the NIP , the rest are imported. Price to remain competitive is challenging , with vaccine manufacturers in India and China manufacturing large portfolio of vaccine and quantities at low costs. Concentration of R&D projects for COVID -19 vaccine at the expense of other vaccines that are in short supply or needed for diseases specific to the region e.g. r otavirus , typhoid, dengue. Opportunities Threats Government support for National Vaccine Security The MoPH/National Vaccine Institute (NVI) are involved in vaccine clinical trials and help coordinate vaccine security agenda among ASEAN countries through the ASEAN Vaccine Security and Self -Reliance (AVSSR) WHO benchmarking of the Thai FDA was conducted in 2018 and reached Maturity level 3. Network of universities and scientists are well versed in vaccine R&D and in collaborating with vaccine manufacturers. Thailand is centrally located in South Asia with airport hub for the flights in the region and beyond. Government financial support has not yet materialized to meet national ambition for vaccine security. The dynamic of regional and international vaccine markets is not well analyzed, monitor ed and understood in Government institutions. Public sector companies do not have the same access to financing as private sector companies. Public sector companies ' financing involves lengthy process for project review and allocation of funds , especially for upgrading production capacity. Government National Vaccine Security plans focus on domestic production and not enough on the regulatory system which needs human and financial resources to keep up with manufacturers production plans using new and more sophisticated 28 vaccines and technologies. Lack of dialogue between public/private manufacturers and national governments within the ASEAN. Conclusion Thailand has a dynamic vaccine R&D environment in which strong partnerships exist between public and priva te sectors and the vaccine manufacturing industry plays an active role. Collaborative relationships with external strategic partners have also been nurtured to facilitate technology transfer, coordinated by the National Vaccine Institute (NVI). The country has an ambitious agenda for development and manufacture of new generation vaccines focusing on future pandemics and neglected tropical diseases, but in order to meet it, significant investment is required to build human resource capacity in full -spectrum of vaccine development and manufacturing, and to maintain the NRA's Maturity Level 3 status. Thailand's NVI has a strong track record of bringing together key stakeholders domestically and regionally and is well -positioned to use its experience to spearhe ad initiatives with nearer -term outputs. For example, at the national level, NVI could foster consultative arrangements between the domestic vaccine industry, university -based scientists with vaccine R&D experience, and NRA program managers through Express ions of Interest (EOI), Requests for Proposal (RFP), and other mechanisms to address current vaccine access challenges for NIP and pandemic response in line with the National Vaccine Security strategy. These consultations would contribute to fine tuning co st/benefit production versus imports of vaccines and provide the rationale for accelerating R&D and production of selected vaccines. At the regional level, the NVI has facilitated the AVSSR through undertaking the ASEAN vaccine baseline survey in 2017 and developing the AVSSR regional strategic and operational plan. Thailand through NVI could take the lead regionally on encouraging enhanced collaboration among ASEAN nations to promote vaccine R&D and strengthen AEFI causality assessments. It could also wor k with international partners like WHO Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety to build the vaccine safety profile of locally manufactured and other vaccines used in NIP and pandemic response, thus helping to build public confidence. There is also a gr eat need to further discuss with ASEAN partners post -pandemic strategies for COVID -19 and seasonal influenza vaccine programs , and to initiate a shared procurement mechan ism through which countries jointly negotiate prices and select suppliers to use durin g national procurement efforts. The pandemic vaccine response is replete with lessons learned that are just beginning to be captured. During COVID -19 response, manufacturers gained invaluable knowledge about pandemic vaccine production cycles and good stor age practices, among other insights, which should be used to inform future preparedness strategies for pandemic vaccine deployment. 29 References ASEAN Secretariat. 2019.
