Good question! Our name says a lot about who we are, what we do, and what you can study here. SPEA was founded as a response to the needs and problems of modern society\u2014needs that were not being addressed by other more traditional schools such as business, arts and sciences, or political science. Our scope is wide, and we address such issues as public finance, nonprofit management, public management, environmental management, policy analysis, health administration, criminal justice and arts administration. Even better, this year we have welcomed several new faculty members who are already making a difference and leading our school into the future. You can see who they are by going here. The school's broadening globalization is already being realized in the expanded programs of studies in several countries around the world through SPEA Overseas Education. Additionally, we are strengthening our research in energy policy, sustainable development, and the prevention of poverty, and building on traditional strengths in public finance, management of nonprofit and public sectors, and arts administration. Beyond your degree program, SPEA offers many opportunities to enrich your academic career, such as the Honors Program, IU in DC program, the Accelerated Master's program, and many more. Seek out what speaks to you to expand your experience here at SPEA! To us, a public or environmental affair is an issue or problem that affects the quality of life on this planet for its citizens. That's a big list, obviously, and our graduates go on to jobs in many fields\u2014public, private, and nonprofit.

If the petition is approved, the student starts with a fresh cumulative grade point index, after which all the rules of academic probation and dismissal (for SPEA) will apply. The school will evaluate the student's transcript, and all courses taken previously will remain on the permanent record. Only credit hours for courses with grades C or above, P, or S may be counted toward degree completion. After approval, the student must complete a minimum of 32 credit hours on the IUPUI campus in order to meet the graduation residency requirement. Requirements for a Second Bachelor's Degree Students must petition for approval to work toward a second bachelor's degree. If permission is granted, students are required to take 30 credit hours beyond the credits used for the first bachelor's degree and satisfy all the requirements for the second degree. Generally, SPEA encourages students to work toward a graduate degree rather than a second bachelor's degree. Policies & Procedures The academic policies of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs are applicable to all SPEA undergraduate programs regardless of the campus where they are offered. Additional policies at individual campuses may also apply to SPEA students. Grading System SPEA follows the official grading system of Indiana University, which no points: I (Incomplete\u2014 an Incomplete will change to an F if the work is not completed within the time period specified by the instructor [an instructor can specify any period of time up to one year]), NR (No Grade Reported), P (Pass), R (Deferred), S (Satisfactory), W (Withdrawal \u2014check the currentEnrollment and Student Academic Information Handbook for deadlines). On the Bloomington campus, any SPEA undergraduate student may retake a course for which he/she received a grade below an A. Students may exercise this option for no more than three courses, totaling no more than 10 credits and may use this option only once for a given course. Additional information can be found at: http:// registrar.indiana.edu/extendedx.shtml. The Indianapolis campus has an expanded policy for grade replacement. A student seeking their first degree may replace up to 15 credits. Additional information about the IUPUI Grade Replacement Policy can be found on the Registrar's page . Grade Appeals Students in Bloomington seeking to make an appeal should first meet with the professor to understand and resolve the issue. If the student feels they are at an impasse they may make an appeal to the Director, Undergraduate Programs. The director will meet individually with the student and the professor to learn about the situation and find a resolution. If no resolution is arrived at, the Director will make a final decision, informing both the student and the professor with a copy to the SPEA Executive Associate Dean. Students in Indianapolis have 90 days after the conclusion of a course to appeal a grade. Resolution of the issue with the class instructor must be attempted before submitting a written appeal to the appropriate program director. In the event the instructor for the Indianapolis campus cannot be contacted, the student must give a notice of intent to appeal at 90 days. Academic Standing Good Academic Standing Probation Critical Probation Dismissal Readmission Critical Probation Under special circumstances, SPEA students may be placed on critical probation. If the student is given the opportunity to enroll under critical probation, SPEA will establish strict conditions that must be met before that student will be allowed to register for future classes. Students who fail to return to good standing at the conclusion of critical probation may be dismissed from the school. SPEA Indianapolis Critical Probation policy 1.SPEA Students will be placed on critical probation during the second term (consecutive or nonconsecutive) that their SPEA major GPA is below 2.3. The SPEA major GPA is considered when a student completes 12 or more credits in the major. 2.If a student is making positive progress in their SPEA courses, but their SPEA GPA continues below 2.3, at the discretion of SPEA undergraduateMay 7, 2013 9 student services, a student could continue on Critical Probation. 3.Critical probation students must participate in intrusive advising and will create a strategic academic plan to return to good standing in consultation with their academic advisor. 4.After the third semester in which a student's SPEA GPA is below 2.3, the student could be dismissed if not making positive progress. 5.Regardless of SPEA GPA, a student could be dismissed if his/her CGPA or semester GPA is below 2.0 for the second consecutive semester. Probation SPEA Bloomington Probation Policy A student will be placed on academic probation if his/her cumulative or semester grade point average is below 2.00 or his/her SPEA GPA falls below 2.30. In the Bachelor of Science in Arts Management, students will be placed on probation if the SPEA GPA falls below a 2.7 or the cumulative falls below a 2.3. In order for the SPEA GPA to be considered, a student must have completed 12 or more credit hours in the major. If a student is not making satisfactory progress toward a degree at the conclusion of the probation semester, the student may be dismissed from the school. SPEA Indianapolis Probation Policy 1.Students will be placed on academic probation if any of the following occur: IU cumulative grade point average (GPA) falls below 2.0, Semester GPA falls below 2.0, or With at least 12 credits in the major, the SPEA GPA falls below 2.3. 2.Students will be informed of their probationary status by letter. 3.SPEA students on academic probation are required to participate in an approved intervention program provided by SPEA during their first semester on academic probation. 4.SPEA students will be continued on probation when their semester GPA is a 2.0 or above but their cumulative IU GPA is below 2.0. Good Academic Standing Students are in good academic standing when their semester and their cumulative grade point averages are 2.00 or above and their SPEA grade point average is at least 2.30. Students must be in good academic standing to graduate. In Bloomington the Bachelor of Science in Arts Management student must maintain a 2.7 (B-) overall grade point average in the core and major requirements as well as a 2.3 (C+) cumulative grade point average in all course work taken at Indiana University in order to graduate.

Student Rights and Responsibilities Each student is responsible for knowing their rights and responsibilities as a member of the academic community as outlined in the Indiana University Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct . In accordance with federal law, student records are confidential and are available to other persons only under specific conditions, as outlined in university regulations. Among the student's obligations is that each student is responsible for knowing and meeting the requirements for their academic programs. Faculty and staff are available to guide and assist students, but the responsibility rests with the student. SPEA students who engage in academic or personal misconduct are subject to SPEA's judicial process and disciplinary actions. SPEA Indianapolis fully supports the rights and responsibilities of students as defined in the IUPUI Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct . The Student Code spells out the expectations for faculty and students, and it provides the framework for SPEA's judicial process. A student is entitled to rights in the pursuit of his or her education; freedom from discrimination and harassment; and freedom of association, expression, advocacy, and publication. A student also has the right to contribute to university governance, to receive accommodations for disabilities, and to access records and facilities. In accordance with federal law, student records are confidential and are available to other persons only under specific conditions as outlined in university regulations. A student is responsible for upholding and following all applicable codes of conduct, including the IUPUI Student Code and SPEA's policy on classroom etiquette and disorderly conduct, and for obeying all applicable policies and procedures and all local, state, and federal laws. A student is responsible for facilitating the learning process, attending class regularly, completing class assignments, and coming to class prepared. In addition, a student is responsible for planning his or her own academic program, planning class schedules, and for meeting the requirements for his or her degree or certificate programs. Faculty and academic advisors are available to assist students in meeting this responsibility. A student is responsible for maintaining and regularly monitoring his or her university accounts, including e-mail and bursar accounts. A student is responsible for using university property and facilities in the pursuit of his or her education, while being mindful of the rights of others to do the same. A student is responsible for upholding and maintaining academic and professional honesty and integrity.School Standards Academic Integrity This is a basic principle requiring that students take credit only for ideas and efforts that are their own. Academic dishonesty violates that principle and undermines the bonds of trust and cooperation among members of the university community. Penalties and procedures that are applicable when academic misconduct or dishonesty occurs are provided in the SPEA Student Honor Code , and the Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct. The policy on academic dishonesty is also published each semester in the Bloomington Enrollment and Student Academic Information Handbook . At Indianapolis, this is a basic principle of intellectual life that holds students responsible for taking credit only for ideas and efforts that are their own. Academic dishonesty violates that principle and undermines the bonds of trust and cooperation among members of the university community, and it is not tolerated. Academic misconduct includes cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, interference, violation of course rules, and facilitating academic dishonesty. Students are responsible for knowing what behaviors and activities constitute these different forms of academic misconduct. Penalties and procedures that are applicable when academic misconduct or dishonesty occurs are described in the IUPUI Code of Student Rights, Responsibilities, and Conduct . Indianapolis Statement on Civility SPEA, which is a professional school, expects students to conduct themselves in a courteous and civil manner in interactions with professors, staff, and fellow students. Examples of discourteous behavior during class include reading the newspaper, working crossword puzzles, using headphones to listen to music or other non-class items, using computers to surf the Web or for other non-class activities, talking or laughing with others, arriving late, and so forth. These behaviors are distracting to the instructor, to staff, and to classmates, and SPEA faculty and staff will address these problems as they arise either in class or on an individual basis. Disorderly conduct that interferes with teaching, research, administration, or other university or university-authorized activity will not be tolerated, and it may result in disciplinary action, including possible suspension and/or expulsion from the university. Degree Requirements Application for Degree Bulletin Policy Course Opportunities Degrees Awarded with Distinction Double-Counting GPA Requirement Hours Requirements Requirements for a Second Bachelor's Degree Transfer Course Policy Application for Graduation All students must complete an application for graduation. At Bloomington, students apply for graduation at http:// www.indiana.edu/~prospective_students/undergrad/ academic_advising/graduation.shtml. This applicationMay 7, 2013 11 must be filed six months before the expected graduation date. In Indianapolis, the graduation application should be completed by September 10 for December graduation, or January 10 for May or August graduation. The SPEA graduation application is found online or by visiting SPEA Student Services. Bulletin Policy Students are expected to complete the requirements for their undergraduate degree within 10 years of admission to the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. Students are allowed to continue beyond this time period only at the discretion of the undergraduate program director or campus director. If a student has not taken classes for three years or more, that student must satisfy the program requirements of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs in effect at the time of reactivation. Requests for deviation from requirements listed in the bulletin must be approved in writing by the program director, whose decision is final. Course Opportunities A student in good academic standing may choose to take a maximum of eight elective courses (two per academic year) pass/fail for the B.S. degree or two courses for the A.S. degree. Deadlines for exercising this option are published in the Enrollment and Student Academic Information Handbook and are strictly enforced. With prior approval, a student may take three courses, totaling no more than 10 credit hours, by independent study through the School of Continuing Studies. Under no circumstances may a student satisfy a core or major/ concentration requirement by independent study. With SPEA faculty approval, a student in good standing may earn a maximum of 9 credit hours through the SPEA internship program. SPEA students may choose to pursue a minor from another school, department, or within SPEA in an area other than their degree or major/concentration. Students interested in a minor should contact that department for additional information. Double-Counting In Bloomington , the following course double-count policies are for admitted SPEA students only. Non- SPEA majors cannot double cunt courses with any SPEA academic program. SPEA Minors: Admitted SPEA students earning a SPEA minor may double count up to six (6) credit hours of minor courses with any other SPEA acadmeic program. Each SPEA minor must have at least nine (9) credit hours that do not count toward any other SPEA academic program. SPEA Certificates: Admitted SPEA students earning a SPEA certificate may double count up to six (6) credit hours of certificate requirements with any other SPEA academic program. The remianing SPEA certificate credit hours cannot be applied toward any other SPEA academic program. SPEA Double Majors: Admitted SPEA students earning two SPEA majors within the same degree may double count up to six (6) credit hours of majorcourses for both majors. Since, SPEA core courses are common to both majors, only specific to the majors (not core courses) are subject to the double- counting limit. Dual Degrees: Admitted SPEA students earning two SPEA degrees may double count up to six (6) credit hours of core or major courses for both degrees. In Indianapolis, generally courses taken to meet a specific degree requirement cannot be double-counted (i.e., used to satisfy any other degree requirement). Students earning a SPEA major, minor, or certificate may double-count two courses across any allowable combination of these programs. The following restrictions apply: 1) students are limited to two minors and 2) SPEA students may not earn a certificate or minor in the same area as their major. GPA Requirement A minimum cumulative and semester GPA of 2.00 is required for the B.S. degrees. In addition, a SPEA core and major/concentration GPA of 2.30 must be maintained in order to graduate. In Bloomington the Bachelor of Science in Arts Management student must maintain a 2.7 (B#) overall grade point average in the core and major requirements as well as a 2.3 (C+) cumulative grade point average in all course work taken at Indiana University in order to graduate. As a joint degree from the College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Public Affairs, the B.S. in Environmental Science requires a cumulative GPA of 2.0 (C) to graduate. All courses taken to satisfy major requirements must be completed with a C- or higher and with a cumulative GPA of 2.0 (C) for all courses taken in the major. For Bloomington students seeking certificates or minors from SPEA, the minimum GPA requirement is 2.00 in all applicable course work. In Indianapolis a minimum cumulative GPA of 2.0 is required for the B.S. degrees. In addition, a SPEA major GPA of 2.3 must be maintained in order to graduate. For students seeking certificates from SPEA, the minimum cumulative GPA requirement is a 2.0 or higher, and for students pursuing a minor the minimum cumulative GPA is a 2.3 or higher in all applicable course work. Hours Requirements Students must successfully complete a minimum of 120 credit hours. However, the Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science requires 122 credit hours. The campus at which a student completes the plurality of course work will award the degree, provided that campus is authorized to grant the degree/major/concentration and that the student has been admitted to that campus. Students may transfer no more than 90 credit hours (60 credits from a junior college) toward a Bachelor of Science degree or 30 credit hours toward an Associate of Science degree. Class standing, based on total credit hours that count toward minimum degree requirements, is as follows: senior, 86 or more; junior, 56-85; sophomore, 26-55; freshman, fewer than 26.12 May 7, 2013 Transfer Course Policy On the Indianapolis campus, no more than 50 percent of courses taken to satisfy the requirements of the Criminal Justice or Public Safety Management Concentrations may be transfer courses from other accredited institutions of higher learning, including all IU campuses. Degrees Awarded with Distinction SPEA recognizes outstanding performance by awarding bachelor's and associate degrees with three levels of distinction to students. The levels of distinction are as follows: highest: 3.90 and above high: 3.70 through 3.89 distinction: 3.50 through 3.69 Requirements for a Second Bachelor's Degree\u2014Bloomington and Indianapolis Students must petition for approval to work toward a second bachelor's degree. If permission is granted, students are required to take 30 credit hours beyond the credits used for the first bachelor's degree and satisfy all the requirements for the second degree. Generally, SPEA encourages students to work toward a graduate degree rather than a second bachelor's degree. Programs The Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs offers a wide range of undergraduate programs on the Bloomington-Indianapolis core campuses. The undergraduate degrees are the Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (B.S.P.A.), the Bachelor of Science in Public Health (B.S.P.H.), the Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice (B.S.C.J.), Bachelor of Science in Arts Management (B.S.A.M.) and, through a joint program with the College of Arts and Sciences, a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (B.S.E.S.). In addition, the undergraduate program includes minors and certificate programs. On July 1, 2008, the Divisions of Public and Environmental Affairs located on the Fort Wayne, Kokomo, Northwest (Gary), and East (Richmond) campuses became SPEA affiliated programs. As affiliated programs these divisions will continue to offer the SPEA curriculum approved for their campus; will continue to grant SPEA degrees to students who fulfill the necessary degree requirements; and will continue to use the SPEA name for academic purposes. Courses will continue to be transferable between the affiliated programs and the Bloomington- Indianapolis core campus programs. Not all degrees, minors, and certificates are offered at all campuses. Information concerning these programs can be obtained by visiting our Web site at www.indiana.edu/~spea/ or from the following SPEA core campus offices: Bloomington Undergraduate Programs Office School of Public and Environmental Affairs SPEA Building 240 Indiana University 1315 E.

Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (B.S.E.S.) Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (B.S.P.A.) Bachelor of Science in Public Health (B.S.P.H.) Minors Certificate Programs About the Bachelor of Science Degree Programs The School of Public and Environmental Affairs recognizes the complex problems facing our society such as global climate change, hazardous waste, escalating health care costs, balance of trade, and international relations. Through the four bachelor of science degree programs, the students develop problem-solving abilities and organizational skills so that they may contribute possible solutions to these and other problems. More than ever, people who take on leadership roles in society\u2014whether as professionals or volunteers\u2014 need formal training in managing staff, fiscal resources, information, public relations and marketing, and technology. With its focus on managing resources and solving problems, the Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (B.S.P.A.) degree prepares students for careers in diverse areas such as federal, state, and local politics and administration; public policy evaluation; management consulting; public relations; management of nonprofit organizations; and monitoring, assessment, and amelioration of environmental problems\u2014to name only a few. Majors in the degree program include: management, legal studies, public and nonprofit management, policy analysis, public financial management, and environmental management. Students who choose to continue with their education after earning an undergraduate degree frequently study law, planning, public affairs, environmental science, or business administration. There is a critical need for scientists who can incorporate their expertise into policies that address environmental concerns, such as global climate change, pollution of water and air, conservation of endangered species andMay 7, 2013 13 habitats, urban sprawl, and human illnesses caused by environmental problems. To meet that need, the School of Public and Environmental Affairs and the College of Arts and Sciences developed the Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science (B.S.E.S.) degree, a unique cooperative program between two leading schools at Indiana University. Designed as a rigorous interdisciplinary science curriculum, the degree prepares students either for direct entry into an environmental science career or for graduate study in the traditional sciences or environmental science. Both government and private organizations are seeking ways to maintain or improve the quality of health care in the United States. At the same time, there is an increasing need to control skyrocketing costs. The Bachelor of Science in Public Health (B.S.P.H.) prepares students to meet those challenges. The Health Administration major prepares students for health management careers by developing their organizational, analytical, managerial, and leadership skills. Graduates often pursue careers in the public, private, or nonprofit sector in areas such as public health, environmental health, health administration, epidemiology, or health policy and planning. B.S.P.H. students have gone on for post- baccalaureate training in diverse areas such as public health, health administration, public affairs, law, business administration, and environmental science and policy. Now more than ever, institutions in the arts need a well trained, dedicated cadre of administrators able to navigate minefields underlying financial pressures, organizational constraints, and shifts in competitive entertainment, as well as consumer interest. The Bachelor of Science in Arts Management (B.S.A.M.) degree provides undergraduate students with the background and skills necessary to function in the management aspects of the arts industry. Graduates of this degree program are prepared to seek entry level careers in areas such as: development and donor relations, marketing, audience development and public relations, artistic direction and programming, financial management, volunteer coordination, arts education, public policy, and advocacy. Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Public Affairs Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs The Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs requires 120 credit hours. The Bloomington campus offers six majors: Environmental Management, Legal Studies, Management, Policy Analysis, Public and Nonprofit Management, and Public Financial Management.

Minors Certificate Programs Indiana University founded the School of Public and Environmental Affairs (SPEA) more than 40 years ago to prepare students to address the issues of modern society in ways that more traditional schools overlooked. At SPEA, people learn how to work in government, nonprofit and business roles to make positive changes in their communities, their states, their countries and the world. SPEA graduates lead the organizations that make and enforce laws, keep communities livable and safe, shape smart public policy, protect the planet and help our fellow30 May 7, 2013 citizens. Through the combined study of civic leadership, management, policy studies, public affairs and media, criminal justice and public safety, SPEA students develop both the practical and philosophical skills that prepare them to develop solutions to society's problems. SPEA Indianapolis offers two bachelor's degrees: a Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (BSPA) and a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice (BSCJ). Within the Public Affairs degree, you can major in Civic Leadership, Management, Policy Studies or Media and Public Affairs. BSPA students learn how to address issues in government and nonprofit settings and prepare to become leaders in their communities, organizations and businesses. Careers for SPEA graduates with a BSPA include legislative staffer, urban planner, director of a nonprofit, lobbyist or financial or policy analyst. Others work in public affairs or government affairs for private companies or nonprofits. Still other BSPA graduates continue their educations in law, planning, public affairs or environmental management. Within Criminal Justice, you can major in Criminal Justice or Public Safety Management. The Criminal Justice major gives students a broad and layered understanding of the history, operations and implications of criminal justice in America. You will be trained to address pressing societal needs related to law enforcement, the judicial system, corrections and national security. With a BSCJ in Criminal Justice, you might work in law enforcement management at the local, state and federal levels, as well as in the courts, prisons and victim advocacy programs. The Public Safety Management major covers the administration of emergency services, the principles of public safety and the art of decision-making. Public Safety Management graduates work in public safety agencies as well as private companies that focus on public management, emergency services, solid and hazardous waste management, public health and more. Both majors are also excellent preparation for pursuing graduate studies in law or criminal justice. Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in Public Affairs Students pursuing the Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs (B.S.P.A.) may major in Civic Leadership, Media and Public Affairs, Management, Policy Studies, or Sustainable Management and Policy. Public Affairs majors focus on how we provide for our citizen, making our communities better places to live, work and raise a family. Public Affairs students study and analyze government policies, and learn how to manage government and nonprofit organizations. A Civic Leadership major teaches students how individuals and organizations can work together to provide for their communities. Graduates often work in public service roles - leading businesses, nonprofit organizations or government agencies. This major is ideal for pre-law student, or students interested in advocacy or community leadership. Media and Public Affairs gives students an in- depth understanding of governance plus the skills needed to use today's media to communicate tocustomers, constituents, employees, supporters, opponents and the many other audiences involved in shaping effective public policy. Students who major in Media and Public Affairs will be prepared for careers as public information officers; government affairs personnel for private or nonprofit organizations; public administrators at the local, state, and federal level; lobbyists; representatives of trade organizations; and reporters for various media on the subjects of public affairs, public administration, public policy personnel and decisions. This major teaches anyone who intends to go in to management (public, private or nonprofit) or who will work in the policy area, when and how to deploy traditional and new media tools to achieve their goals. A Management major teaches some of the things you'd learn in a business school, but you get the additional benefit of leaning how public agencies and nonprofit organizations operate. This holistic approach helps graduates move seamlessly between business, nonprofit and government management roles. A Policy Studies major prepares students to analyze and assess the usefulness of existing and proposed laws. This major emphasizes critical thinking skills. Graduates often go on to law school or directly into positions in government or government relations. A major gives students a solid understanding of public affairs, finance, policy-making and civic engagement, combined with specialized classes in the principles of sustainability, environmental justice and green technologies. Graduates of the program will find employment in the growing field of sustainability by assuming community and government roles, working for environmental nonprofit groups, owning or managing \"green\" businesses, and conducting research and legislative analysis. This major is also an excellent choice for a pre-law student. Civic Leadership (B.S.P.A.) The Bachelor of Science in Public Affairs in Civic Leadership requires 120 credit hours. The SPEA curriculum is divided into three categories: general education, electives, and major area. Public Affairs majors focus on how we provide for our citizens, making our communities better places to live, work and raise a family. Public Affairs students study and analyze government policies, and learn how to manage government and nonprofit organizations. A Civic Leadership major teaches students how individuals and organizations can work together to provide for their communities. Graduates often work in public service roles - leading businesses, nonprofit organizations or government agencies. This major is ideal for pre-law students, or students interested in advocacy or community leadership. 1. Communications (3 courses; 9 cr.) ENG-W 131 Elementary Composition I (3 cr.)
