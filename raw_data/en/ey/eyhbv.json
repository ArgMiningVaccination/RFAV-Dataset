The resources in this Topic Collection will help healthcare facility staff plan for burn casualties as a result of structural fires, blast emergencies, or chemical burns caused by terrorist attacks or hazardous materials incidents. Select articles provide a review of emergency burn care (including care of patients that may have to remain at non-burn centers while awaiting transfer), but this collection is not a comprehensive review of burn care.
