Hussein Katz TheMail I begin to realize that those things that bring joy to us are still here, and still working their magic in our lives. Thank you, AARP , for that jolt of happiness you bring me each month. I'm glad I read slowly. CAROLYN COLMER Eureka Springs, ArkansasOur February/March issue featured Lily Tomlin, Jane Fonda, Sally Field & Rita Moreno.I'll always be a fan of Lily Tomlin. Years ago, when I was editor of a local magazine, she was coming to town for a show, so I did a short interview with her. Most celebrities can't wait to be done with these talks. But after the allotted 15 min-utes, Lily asked if I had everything I needed and offered more time. Her generosity is one of my best memo - ries from my career. GLENN GULLICKSON Phoenix, Arizona THE POWER OF SAYING THANKS Your advice [\"Don't Wait to ... Say Thank You\"] for happiness rang true for me. Several years ago, I tracked down my senior year English lit teacher to tell her how she opened up a world of literature for me like no other teacher, from Great Expectations to Moll Flanders. Forty-three years after her class, I finally finished Wuthering Heights. My teacher was touched, to say the least. And I was buoyant. JOHN F. HEENEHAN Madison, New Jersey NOT CUCKOO FOR COCOA One thing to watch out for in cocoa products is heavy metal content [\"Loco for Cocoa\"]. Consumer Reports just did an article regarding the hazards of lead and cadmium in chocolate. There was a wide variety of levels found in the various popu-lar brands. ANDREW WING King of Prussia, Pennsylvania LET'S TALK ABOUT SEX Any conversation about sex in a woman's 50s is incomplete without discussing hormone replacement therapy [\"Start Your Own Sexual Revolution\"]. Menopause hits us all with different severity. Hormone replacement therapy helps many women enjoy sex again. SHELLY GATES Griffith, IndianaFAN-TASTIC! I just want to give a shout-out to your wonderful magazine. The world events going on right now are scary, and it calms me to cozy up in my recliner and open up your inspiring magazine and read feel-good articles like \"Fans (and Friends) Forever.\" 4 AARP THE MAGAZINE AARP commercial member benefits are provided by third parties, not by AARP or its affiliates.

His forth - coming album is Now . \"I can only write songs for me. I can't write them for you.\" Groomer: Casey Geren for BA Reps; left: Henry Diltz/Corbis via Getty Images PHOTOGRAPH BY THE TYLER TWINS1 Music = Honesty When you're writing songs, you have to tell the truth, to reflect the times. Most of the choices I've made started with my mother and father telling me, \"Follow your heart and you won't go wrong.\" 2 Find Y our Place I came to New York City with the Hollies for the first time in 1965. It thrilled me. \"Wait, I can have a cheeseburger delivered in five minutes? What a country this is!\" I never wanted to go back to England, and I never did. 3 T ake Leaps of Faith The first time I sang with David Crosby and Stephen Stills, there was no doubt what I had to do. I was al - ready in a famous band, and we had been f amous for seven years. People thought I was f------ crazy to leave the Hollies. \"Give up all the women, the money and the fame?\" They had not heard me, David and Stephen sing\u2014but I had. 4 Collab Is Good I played \"Teach Your Children\" for Stephen when I'd just fin - ished it. He said, \"Pretty good song, Gr aham, but don't ever play it like that again. You sound like Henry VIII doing 'Greensleeves.' This is how it should go.\" And he played a beautiful guitar part that turned it into a hit. 5 Make Up Swiftly David was my best friend for over 50 years. But eventually, I had to dis - tance myself from him. He'd said ter- rible things about Neil Young's wife [ actress Daryl Hannah] and others. When it's uncomfortable to be around a friend, it's time to move on. But his death [on January 18] was like an earthquake; with those smaller earthquakes that happen af - terwards. It wasn't until two or three da ys after he passed that I realized he was gone. The fact is, we were getting a little closer at the end. He had just left me a voice mail saying he wanted to talk, to apologize, and could we set up a time. And I heard from his son that he was ecstatic that we were going to reconnect. But then he was gone. 6 Sing for Change In the '60s we thought we could stop the Vietnam War if we riled people up with our songs. I still believe we can change the world. 7 In the End, We All Go Solo The opening line of my new album is, \"I used to think that I could never love again / I used to think tha t I'd be all on my own.\" At 81 years old, one has to think about these things. We're all going to die alone, every single one of us, e ven though there may be somebody around. \u2014As told to Rob Tannenbaum7 Life Lessons From Graham Nash Crosby, Stills & o .

In a recent adventure in a Kia Sorento plug-in hybrid, I couldn't easily park. The round device had three letters next to it: D, R and N. But where was P? Turns out that was in the center of the puck. And then there's the touch screen. You may find that adjusting the temperature, or even changing the radio station, requires finding the right on-screen menu, as knobs, switches and dials are grad-ually getting phased out. Of course, you can seek answers in the owner's manual, but that can require look - ing through hundreds of pages. But before you panic, there is help. I recently had a problem pairing my phone with a car's infotainment system, and a rental-car representative provided aid with a smile. But be aware that help may depend on how busy the place is. Another option is to request a car that's the same model, or at least make, as the one you have at home. No guarantees that you'll get that, though. And when all else fails, there's always YouTube. \u2014Rick DeBruhl From top left: Illustration by Liam Eisenberg; Photo Illustration by Paul Spella (photo credit Getty Images); icons by Noun Project (3); Illustrations by Paul Windle (2); Getty ImagesUp front / GO IT WAS JUST before dawn when I pulled the rented Toyota RAV4 into the gas station. What should have been a quick fill-up turned into an automotive adventure. I searched and searched but couldn't find the release for the fuel flap. I resorted to watching a YouTube video on my phone to solve my dilemma. (The release was a small switch low on the front panel of the vehicle.) This exposes an issue with new cars: They're more confusing than ever. Gone are the days when manufacturers had mostly standardized systems. That's fine when you own a car and understand it, but in the rental market, it can be infuriating.

To remove stains from wood frames, lightly sand the area with fine-grade sandpaper. Wash synthetic wicker Rinse off resin wicker furniture every few weeks, or weekly if it's regularly exposed to salt water or chlorine. If debris becomes lodged in the textured surface, remove it with an extra-soft toothbrush.

As for regular washings, avoid using abrasive cleansers on aluminum. Instead, opt for a soft cloth and a nonabrasive product, and rinse well.

A few things to know: 1For best results, have the rooms professionally photographed and then work with a virtual-staging company, which designs the rooms. This isn't a task for amateurs. 2It also works best if you've moved out of your home, so the rooms are clear and can be photo - graphed empty.

I'm still paying for all that jazz now. [Laughs, tapping her overworked knees.] Dolores and ChitaMy full name is Dolores Conchita Figueroa del Rivero. My father was a Puerto Rican clarinetist and sax player; my Scottish-Irish mother was a government clerk. I was raised Catholic, and I've often said I have two angels\u2014Chita and Dolores\u2014one on each shoul - der. Chita was the people pleaser . Dolores would tell it like it was. A sad-happy beginning I was one of five, and we played and fought and laughed and ate, all part of a mixed-race neighbor - hood in Washington, D.C. But in 1940 , when I was 7, Daddy became seriously ill. We weren't allowed in the hospital, so w e'd stand outside and see him at his window. And then he passed away. It was rough, but somehow my mother kept us all on an even keel. Surprise! I discovered that my maternal grandparents were mulatto, mixed-race descendants of the once enslaved. I wished I'd known earlier\u2014it might have deepened my connec - tion with Black friends and c olleagues, especially my onetime love Sammy Davis Jr. The energizer ChitaMother kne w I had to be channeled. At 16, I auditioned for the School of American Ballet, and this tall, blond dancer came running from the audition room screaming, \"I can't!\" If she couldn't, how could I? I was short, brown and nervous as hell, but my teacher said, \"Just stay in your own lane and look straight ahead.\" And I got in. One step, one pli\u00e9, led to another\u2014and, ultimately, Broadway. Tony Award-winning actress Chita Rivera, 90, has published Chita: A Memoir, available online and in bookstores on April 25.

I'm pretty satisfied, but [laughs] there are five Tonys out there that should have been mine! The Big 9-Oh I just had a birthday, and it was a biggie. Ninety! My daughter threw me an amaz - ing party in Manhattan. She in vited a lot of my old friends. And when I spied a celebra - tory banner with that huge number , I shivered. That's when my polite side, my Chita side, came out: I let them keep the banner up. But I don't want to leave.

In honor of Mother's Day, money gurus share lessons they learned from the women who raised them By MARGIE ZABLE FISHER ILLUSTRATIONS BY TOMI UMHow to find your best bank P . 30 / A woman worries about a divorce's impact. P. 3 3 INSIDE Houses Are Like Spouses My mother encouraged my sister and me to pursue careers that would help us create an independent identity from our spous - es. Mom modeled this by bec oming a teacher and then a Realtor. I remember hearing her trying to calm down her clients during the emotional process of buying or selling a home. One piece of her advice I always valued was \"A house is like a spouse: There's more than one for you in the world!\" \u2014Jill Schlesinger, CBS News business analyst and author of The Great Money Reset There's Always a Way In my 20s, I discovered that when my siblings and I were children, my mom had called up the local soccer league and asked if there was any way to waive the fees, since paying for multiple kids in a soccer league is expensive. They said, \"Sure\u2014if you chalk the fields before the games.\" My mom did just that, so we could play soccer with uniforms and equipment. She taught me that there's always a way. \u2014Ramit Sethi, author of I Will Teach You to Be Rich Always Be Saving The best financial advice I received was from my grandmother Big Mama, my guardian from when I was 4. When I was 14 and got my first job, as a tutor, she told me to save something from that paycheck\u2014and every time I got paid. So all my working life, I have saved part of my pay. Every. Single. Paycheck. She made me a lifelong saver in good times and bad. My husband and I put our children through college with no debt, largely because of our saving habits. Lots of people look for a quick way to get rich. But my grandma was right: Save a little something from every paycheck and patiently grow your wealth. \u2014Michelle Singletary, nationally syndicated personal finance columnist for The Washington Post and author of What to Do With Your Money When Crisis Hits Respect the Budget When I was a kid, I always complained about what my mom made for dinner. So she once told me, \"Let's see what you can do with this budget.\" The week I was in charge, we ate hot dogs every night. And I quickly decided I did not want to eat hot dogs every day for the rest of my life. I think she wanted to teach me about the challenge of living within your means. But I learned a different lesson: how important it was for me to expand my means, not just live within them. \u2014Robert Kiyosaki, author of the Rich Dad Poor Dad series of books Invest for the Long Run In the 1970s, my mother made a small investment in a stock mutual fund. She always talked about how it grew over time, and how she could tap some of it for ma - jor home improvements. It sho wed me the importance of being a lifelong investor. \u2014Carrie Schwab-Pomerantz, president of the Charles Schwab Foundation Top: Badge design by Matt Lehman 30 AARP THE MAGAZINE Money Saver OVER THE YEARS, banks in the U.S. have dramat - ically changed how they operate and what services they offer. But their main function remains the same for most house - holds: to serve as a hub for everyday cash flow. Paycheck received? Right into your bank account. Bills to be paid? Right from your bank account. Cash needed for the weekend? Right out of your bank's ATM. Given the importance of all that cash flow, you'd think we'd be picky about our bank. But it's the opposite. Americans age 55 and up have been using their current checking account for an average of about 25 years, according to a 2021 Bankrate survey. One of the top reasons respondents give for sticking: \"It's the same account I've always had.\" There are better criteria for deciding where to keep an account. While the interest rates you earn on deposits or pay on loans may be import - ant, here are five other factors to consider. Maintenance fees If a bank charges you a monthly fee for your account, those dollars can add up. The most common monthly charge is $12, according to Bankrate, or $144 a year. The average minimum balance you need in an account to get monthly charges waived is about $540. So if you're paying a high monthly fee for your account, you might want to look for an account elsewhere, or Penalties Penalty fees include charges for overdrafts or for using an out-of-network ATM. Banks raked in an estimated $15.5 billion in overdraft and nonsufficient funds revenue in 2019, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In the face of CFPB concerns about overdraft fees, some banks have elim-inated them altogether. That's worth asking about. \"We can't necessarily plan for a pandemic or layoffs,\" says Rachel Gittleman, financial services outreach manager for the Consumer Federation of America. So make sure that your bank's fee structure works both for now and for more difficult times, she says. Banks are required to disclose their fees; you can search online for the bank's name and \"fees\" to find them on their websites. Then compare different banks' charges that might affect you. Branches The older you are, the more likely you are to bank in person. But the number of bank branches in the U.S. has declined for a decade, from more than 85,000 in 2011 to around 72,000 in 2021. If going to a branch is important to you, consider whether most of your visits are to a few nearby locations or whether you want to be able to bank anywhere in your state, your region or across the country. You can search for the bank's name and \"find a branch or ATM\" to see what's near you. Credit union members can ac - cess more than 5,400 br anches and PHOTOGRAPHS BY NICK FERRARImaybe an account at your current bank with a different fee structure. You could be required to use direct deposit or link a savings account, or you may have to pay to receive a pa-per statement. Certain states require banks to offer \"lifeline\" low-fee accounts. And the nonprofit Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund is encouraging banks to provide what are known as Bank On accounts\u2014low-cost accounts that meet certain standards, such as an opening depos-it of $25 or less.

Even as the overall number of branches is on the decline, some banks are expanding their networks in certain cities. You can assess a bank's commitment to your area (or lack thereof ) by seeing if it has shut branches recently or instead seems to be investing in the in-store locations, says Gittleman. You might also visit a branch to see what services it offers and to get a sense of how attentive it is to customers. Technology If in-person banking isn't a priority or if no bank branches are particularly convenient to where you live, well-designed remote banking technology will make your life easier. Don't want to travel to a branch to deposit checks? Many banks now have apps that let you make a deposit from your living room; it's as simple as taking a picture of a check with a phone or tablet. Tired of writing a rent check every month? You may be able to schedule automatic monthly payments. Like keeping a close eye on your bank balance? Get a text notification after every transac - tion. \"Think about how you plan to interact with your bank and make sure that the financial institution Money Saver that you choose has all of those options available,\" says Gittleman. Since it can be difficult to assess a bank's technology if you don't already have an account there, your best bet is to ask fam- ily and friends what they think of the tech at their banks. Special services Hate waiting in line? Some banks let customers line up digitally before getting to the branch. Need cash but don't have your debit card? Some institutions let you withdraw money from an ATM by entering your PIN into a mobile wallet. Banks are also using artificial intelligence to make online chats feel more con-versational, says Amanda Swanson, a senior director at Cornerstone Advisors, a banking consulting firm. Look for special features that address your circumstances, and ask people you know about what services stand out at their bank. People who have lower credit or thin-file credit may have a better chance of being ap - proved for a mortgage or other loan if the bank evaluates cash flow data\u2014instead of pulling a credit report\u2014while reviewing their application. If you have more assets, a bank might offer wealth management services at a reduced cost or an interest rate discount on a mortgage. n Sharon Waters, a former CPA, has written for The Washington Post and other publications.

These so-called gray divorces, which tend to happen when spouses are past their peak earning years, can be particularly troubling for women, says Susan Brown, a sociology professor at Bowling Green State University. Research she coau-thored found that older women who divorce see their standard of living drop an average of 45 percent, com-pared to 21 percent for men their age. Susan suspects that a divorce would put a crimp in her modest lifestyle\u2014one reason she prefers the status quo. But suspecting isn't the same as knowing. So the two of us sat down with Rhonda Noordyk, a certified divorce financial analyst and CEO of the Milwaukee-based Women's Financial Wellness Center, to assess three possible paths. 1 Stay married. This is clearly a money-saving option, especially for Susan. The Hunnicutts' taxes are likely lower because they file jointly rather than as married filing sepa-rately, as others in their spot might do. And Susan's health insurance costs are low. Those tax filings and the credit card they share for household expenses are strong proof of their ability to work together, Noordyk says. But there are risks. One spouse could run up debts that the other could be partly responsible for. In a worst-case scenario, if one of them needs to go into a long-term A woman who's amicably separated wants to make sure her finances are secureSplit Up but Still Married Want Jean Chatzky's help in sorting out a financial problem? Send an email to rescue@aarp.org.Jean Chatzky TO THE RESCUE THE OUTCOME Susan's plan is to get a postnup. In fact, Carter says, the two of them have already begun talking about it. Susan has also started to apply for full-time jobs. \"I think my future self would say, It's a good idea to formalize this in some way,\" Susan says. \"I think I will be in a place of power if I take the reins and take action.\" nTHE PROBLEM Married for 36 years, Susan and Carter Hunnicutt of Milwaukee have been separated for the past six. They've been more than amica-ble. Susan, a freelance writer, lives in half of the duplex home they own. Carter, a musician and former fire captain, sends her half of his monthly pension and keeps her on his low-cost health plan. \"We've been able to be cooperative,\" says Carter, 61. Still, he characterizes their current agreement as \"transitory.\" Seeing that Carter has a girlfriend and sensing the ground starting to shift, Susan, 63, worries about how a divorce might affect her finances. So what should they do? care facility, the expense could be a drain on assets for both of them. 2 Get divorced. While a divorce will bring closure, it will change the fi-nancial landscape. Paying for her own health insurance could run Susan at least several hundred dollars a month until she qualifies for Medicare. Then there's housing. If they sold the duplex in a divorce, Susan estimates that the cost of renting a new place would eat through her share of the proceeds in seven years. And Susan isn't sure she's emotionally ready for the change. \"Part of my identity is still being married,\" she says. Which is why Noordyk tees up ... 3 Consider a postnup. A postnup - tial agreement\u2014just like a prenup, except it's signed after a wedding, not before\u2014is a legal document intended to outline the terms of a possible divorce before either spouse files. But it can also redefine an ongo - ing marriage to help avoid a divorce. In Susan's case, Noordyk says, a postnup could reduce her financial risks by codifying the practices the couple has employed for the past half decade, such as paying for Carter's housing with the money they earn by renting out half of their duplex. Postnups can be complicated, however, and laws governing them vary by state. To put one in place, it's essential that each spouse has his or her own attorney, which can run the couple a few thousand dollars. Sara FIXES P .

Both the left and right twisted at the an- kle so that the bottoms turned toward each other at 45-degree angles\u2014what doctors call supination. This caused me to walk, when I could, on the outside edges of my feet. I was diagnosed at age 6 with a rare genetic ill- ness (one of every 20,000 births), multiple epiph-yseal dysplasia (MED), a condition I share with actor Danny DeVito. Basically, my bones deform at the joints throughout my body. Think broken gears grinding together, ever eroding with age. As a kid, I biked all over the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. At Boston University, I strode the miles-long city campus from end to end. I took a job as a writer and editor in Knoxville, where I got together with my wife of 36 years. We had three daughters, and I threw them around in the pool and played Daddy Shark at the beach. Professionally, I developed and edited scores of publications, and coauthored and edited two travel books. With a friend, I founded a communications and marketing company, and traveled around the South and Midwest, pitching and closing deals. But at age 53, it all came crashing down. That's when my feet started bending and I suddenly needed a wheel-chair to get around. My marketing company had paid me a six-figure salary, but now I couldn't do the required travel. I sold my half of the business to my partner for $1 and was forced to retire due to disability. It was not only a blow to my income in my prime earn- ILLUSTRATION BY CHRIS GASHLIFE 6.0 Disease pushed an editor into a wheelchair and early retirement, followed by a period of depression\u2014and then reignition By RANDALL H.

(I helped, with Social Security disability payments.) I felt guilt and shame for putting that on her, but we had no choice, and she didn't complain. Over the next couple of years, I had my ankles fused so that my feet lay flat again and I could walk with a cane. This kicked off a surgery-palooza. I had both knees replaced, both shoulders replaced and my stomach reduced via bariatric surgery to deal with my burgeoning weight from being sedentary. Though the surgeries made my joints more stable, the osteoarthritis throughout my body left me in crippling chronic pain. And then depres-sion crept in. With this retirement, I had lost my sense of purpose, identity and relevance. As I moved from my 50s into my 60s, I experienced a decade of meh.

How to relate better to your 20-something children novel. Mostly I spent my days watching Ellen and sports. Then, for my 63rd birthday, I received an Amazon gift card from a daughter, which I turned into a Bluetooth keyboard for my trusty iPad. It literally changed my life. I could now sit in my La-Z-Boy and write for the limited time each day my pain would allow. I jotted down notes for a book that would capture what I had learned about writing and editing during my career, and with that came a renewed sense of purpose. I self-published the book on Amazon and began writing personal essays\u2014on pain, health, retirement; several have been published. In short, I mounted a career comeback that's in progress as I type these words. Here are a few things I learned along the way. Talk it through. People want to help. Turn to a loved one, friend or professional and express your feelings. I have seen a counselor week - ly for years. Opening up led to a brighter outlook. Retool. Sometimes you literally need the right tools to empower you. Don't worry if you're not tech-savvy; jump in and try apps on your smartphone or learn to use real-world tools, like a lathe. My brother bought one later in life and took up woodworking. He turned bowls and gave them as gifts for holidays and birthdays\u2014it has brought him untold pleasure. Go for a win. Writing reignited my competitive spirit. You may not be as competitive, but we all like wins. Find something you're good at and practice it. Look for low-hanging fruit, like bolstering your bird-watching life list. Don't forget to celebrate what you've accomplished. Do things for purpose. Retired or not, people need purpose to their lives. In addition to being there for my family, my renewed mission is to capture my experience and use that to inspire others. It may take some work to find what feels rewarding to you. Try out hobbies\u2014a purpose needn't mean a career restart like I'm attempt - ing. If you're stumped, search places like church and local volunteer organizations for opportunities to show and share what you know. Randall H.

BEING A YOUNG ADULT is harder today than it was a generation ago. The cost of housing has risen five times faster than incomes; mental health issues like anxiety and depression are on the rise; and young people are dealing with a mix of serious stressors\u2014among them divisive politics, war and, of course, COVID. The result is a prolonged adolescence\u2014until around 30\u2014during which adult children are trying to establish their autonomy and prove that they are capable adults. I've been researching what's happening and how parents can deal. Some tips: Avoid saying \"When I was your age ...\" Parents think, Oh my God, I was already having children when I was in my late 20s, and my kid is not even in a relationship. But the timetable for growing up has changed, and this com - ment is unhelpful and inappropriate. R emember, it's not about you. When kids say, \"Mind your own business,\" be aware that as young adults develop independence, they are often hypersensitive to suggestions they are not grown up yet. Let it go. Resolve disputes constructively. Instead of com - plaining to your son about his clothes strewn across the floor , enlist him in the solution. Tell him, \"We can't clean or vacuum if your clothes are all over. Can we think of a solution that both of us can live with?\" Bite your tongue. Think before you offer opinions. Ask yourself, What is it I don't like about this? It might be that it's just not the way you did it\u2014in which case, keep quiet. (Though if your adult child is in danger or could be harmed by their action, then definitely speak up.) Be patient.

Enter the National High way Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which in 1968 mandated seat belts in both front and back seats of new cars. The grumbling was deafening. Indeed, popular sentiment at the time held that in the event of a crash, you were safer if you were thrown from the vehicle. In the early 1980s, only about 10 percent of car passengers belted in. But we came around. Now 90 percent belt in, which saves 40 lives a day, according to the NHTSA. I personally get all wobbly without the feeling of a belt over my shoulder and across my belly.

I knew to follow the other comics' leads and let the method work. \"Yes, And\" is the cornerstone of comic improvisation\u2014accepting what your acting partner says and adding to it. If they say, \"I love being a Martian,\" you might say, \"Yeah, buzzing Earth and scaring humans is great for a date night.\" Simple. Or is it? I was about to find out. At age 60, I was doing my first improv show. My first love in life was acting. I was a theater major for a time but switched to English because it was (a tad) more prac - tical. Still, the stage beckoned. I took an improv class in my 20s and loved it. But it wasn't until my 50s that a friend and I took a class at The Second City in Chica-go, improv's mothership. I learned to \"Yes, And\" and avoid rookie mistakes: saying too much, getting testy from nerves and trying to be funny all the time. Occasionally I made my classmates\u2014and my teacher\u2014laugh. Then came the pandemic. But finally, last year, I had the chance to perform with an improv troupe at a local fundraiser. The first scene fea - tured a husband and wife fighting. I had an idea. I jumped in as the other woman snuggled up to my \" Jimmykins\" and outed the husband as a cheater. It worked! Not everything I did was comedy gold or even bronze, but people laughed. Genuine, gut-level laughs. I glimpsed my husband in the first row. His face was red\u2014from laughter, not embarrassment! Afterward, the elderly mother of a dear friend said, chuckling, \"I saw a different side of you tonight.\" That side was always there, just waiting for a chance. \u2014Tara McClellan McAndrew 034-038_ATM-APR_MAY-2023-TM6 THIS third parties, not by AARP or its afliates.

Not many aspiring actresses become Hollywood leading ladies, and not many leading ladies have careers that span more than 50 years, that garner four Oscar nominations (including one win) or that link them to some of the most icon-ic directors and costars in cinema history. But when I ask Keaton for the secret to her success and longevity in the business, she seems stumped. Does she understand why directors and audiences have been so taken with her all this time? A long silence. Then, \"I understand my great good fortune. That's what I understand,\" says Keaton, 77 , by phone from her The CURIOUS MIND and SINGULAR SUCCESS of DIANE hairstylist: Jill CrosbyAnd she is still in demand. In director Bill Holderman's Book Club: The Next Chapter, Keaton and costars Jane Fonda, Mary Steenburgen and Candice Bergen reprise their roles from the 2018 film to cavort through Italy, flirting with locals and draining bottles of prosecco. Keaton has now added a new line to her r\u00e9sum\u00e9: Insta- gram star. Her account has been called \"a national treasure\" by the digerati at Mashable, \"a wholesome hub of never- before-seen throwbacks, hilarious jokes, nods to impressive art and architecture, thoughtful birthday wishes to fellow celebs, and quality Crush Content.\" And we've discovered something. By talking to Keaton about her very public Instagram account\u2014she has some 2.3 million followers\u2014we got a better understanding of what's behind the quirky allure that has fostered one of Hollywood's greatest careers, an allure Keaton herself can't quite explain. THE OLDEST OF four children, Keaton spent her earliest years in the Los An-geles neighborhood of Highland Park, where her family lived in a corrugated metal Quonset hut. Once, seeing a sim-ilar building on the outskirts of Tucson, Keaton posted a photo to Instagram and wrote, \"It made me miss my mom and dad.\" Her father was John Hall, a civil engineer and real estate broker, and her mother, the former Dorothy Keaton, was a homemaker. (Keaton uses her mother's maiden name because there was already an actress named Diane Hall.) Dorothy, who was an amateur photographer, collagist, potter and diarist, yearned for recognition\u2014a yearning that inspired Keaton's own professional aspirations. \"I watched my mother get crowned Mrs. Highland Park. I remember going, 'Oh my God, I want that too. I want to go up there on the stage. ' \" Clockwise from top right: Keaton in her home office; her boots; a kitchen entryway, with hats and cutting boards home in Los Angeles. \"There was an aspect to me that was, I think, a little more, I don't know ...\" She hunts for words to explain the tragicomic, off-kilter appeal of so much of her work. \"I wasn't what you'd call 'a real actress.' I was more, well, not quite there. It just wasn't me. Shoot, the whole thing is so strange to even think back on.\" That \"whole thing\" includes roles as Kay Corleone in the Godfather films; as the endearing, self-deprecating heroine of Annie Hall; as a journalist in Reds; and as a hard-charging single mom in Baby Boom. Keaton's pantheon of leading men has featured Woody Allen, Warren Beatty, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson, Morgan Freeman, Mel Gibson, Michael Douglas, Sam Shepard, Richard Gere\u2014let's keep going\u2014even Steve Martin and Keanu Reeves. Keaton also plays well with women, like Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn, her costars in the surprise 1996 smash hit The First Wives was a young girl, about 6, I watched my mother get crowned Mrs. Highland Park,\" Keaton recalls. \"I remem- ber going, 'Oh my God, I want that too. I want to go up there on the stage where it's all lit up.'\" Dorothy went on to win the Mrs. Los Angeles title, but a family move to Santa Ana, south of Los Angeles, curtailed her broader ambitions. \"That was the end of it,\" Keaton recalls. \"Life changes.\" That Dorothy couldn't realize her dreams fueled her daughter's drive. \"I saw what my mother went through,\" she says. At 19, Keaton moved to New York to study acting. \"I wanted to be famous,\" she told AARP in 2015. \"I wanted to be a movie star.\" It didn't take long. Keaton worked with famed acting coach Sandy Meisner before making her Broadway debut in the original cast of Hair\u2014in which she notably refused to disrobe\u2014in 1968. She next teamed up with Woody Allen on the stage and film ver - sions of Play It Again, Sam. Then, long before Allen's film came out, Keaton auditioned for The Godfather. The Mario Puzo novel had spent 67 weeks on the New Y ork Times bestseller list following its publication in 1969, but somehow Keaton had missed it. \"I didn't even know what The Godfather was,\" she recalls. \"Someone said to me, 'You've got to go and audition for things,' so I auditioned for the film, and I got the role of Kay Corle - one,\" wife of a mafia scion. In an Instagram video marking the 50th anniversary of the film last year, Keaton narrated clips from her audition with costar Al Pacino, sound-ing incredulous that she, a comic actress, had been cast in the dramatic role: \"That was the strangest thing to ever happen to me in my whole life.\" In the spring of 1972, Play It Again, Sam and The Godfather were released six weeks apart. \"After that, things were different,\" Keaton admits. She was on her way. Her Oscar for Annie Hall followed six years later, when her affinity for oversize menswear and floppy hats sparked a trend. That film was followed by decades of com-edies and a few dramatic roles, including in Reds and Marvin's Room, both of which earned her best actress Oscar nods. (Her fourth nomination was for writer/director Nancy Meyers' Something's Gotta Give.) Last August, Keaton stuck her hands in wet cement as part of a ceremony to place her handprints and foot - prints at the TCL Chinese Theatre. Choking up during her speech, she dedi-cated the moment to her parents. ON VALENTINE'S DAY this year, Keaton posted a montage of some of her steamiest make-out scenes, dedicated to \"all the men who were paid to kiss me.\" (Responded Meyers: \"Hilarious but as someone who was around for a few of those\u2014those guys always wanted one more take. \") The actress has had several high-profile romances in her life, including with Woody Allen, Warren Beatty and Al Pacino, but she has never married. Today, she declares, she is happy on the shelf. \"I don't date,\" she says. \"Highly unlikely. I don't remember anyone calling me, going, 'This is So-and-So. I'd like to take you out.' They don't happen. Of course not.\" But Keaton didn't allow the lack of a partner to keep her from having a family. At age 50, she adopted daughter Dexter, now 27 . Son Duke, 22, arrived five years later. \"They're great,\" she says simply. \"They're doing good.\" Over the past few years, though, as her nest has emptied\u2014Dexter got married and Duke got his own place\u2014Keaton's golden retriever, Reggie, has become her day-to-day companion. \"A friend of mine gave her to me,\" says Keaton. \"I didn't even ask for her. He came to me and said, 'I think you need this dog.' I was like, 'OK, I guess?' Of course, now I just love her. Dogs are irresistible. They're just idiots. Reggie is a big jerk, and she's a great jerk, and she's hilarious.\" On Instagram, Reggie can be seen greedily soaking in Keaton's attention while the actress, looking into the dog's eyes, croons \"How Deep Is the Ocean?\" Keaton captioned the post, \"Don't forget to sing dogs!\" One of Keaton's main inanimate pas- sions is photography. Her time in Italy during last year's shoot for the Book Club sequel \"was one of the best experiences ever for me on a movie,\" she says. \"My en-tire trip was really about all of the things I saw and took pictures of. You walk around the streets and don't know what you're going to come across\u2014that's how rich it is.\" On Instagram, Keaton posted a montage of door and window photos she'd snapped in Italy, calling doors \"my new obsession.\" Her friend Allison Kaye, a manager, commented: \"Obsessed with you.\" Replied Keaton: \" \" THE ACTRESS HAS published three mem - oirs in all: Then Again, a remembrance of her mother, in 2011; Let's Just Say It Wasn't Pretty, on the culture of beauty and Keaton's iconic style, in 2014; and the intimate and heart -Getty Images (Oscar); Everett Collection (4) APRIL / MAY 2023 45(CONTINUED ON PAGE 86) Top of her Game Keaton's Oscar- nominated performances Annie Hall, 1977 Something's Gotta Give, 1981 Marvin's CREDIT TEEKAY Big-group vacations are all the rage. But how do you plan an unforgettable and low-drama vacation involving multiple families or friends and still maintain your sanity (without going broke)? These six families show us how it's done By Ken Budd 046-050_ATM-APR_MAY-2023-TM6-Big PMMY NINE brothers and sisters and I were raised on a farm in Louisi- ana, so we love the outdoors. As we got older, we all wanted our kids to know their heritage. So we started to have yearly get-togethers. My sister Debbie and I manage the planning. We have a family Facebook group, and we use that to get input. Once we choose a campground, Deb and I prepare a menu for each meal. We post it and everybody signs up for food, meal prep and cleanup. The best moments are the camp - fires at night. We'll sing and tell stories. I now know family I would never have had the chance to be close to. And we have so much fun. APRIL / MAY 2023 47BEACH HOUSE TIPS Rent a year in advance. \"When we leave, we book the house for the next year,\" Oransky says. Yes, demand is that high. Try staying for more than a week. \"With this many peo - ple, it takes a f ew days to get in the groove,\" Oransky says. Be meal smart. Sched - ule one big f ood shop on day one, bring supplies from home, rotate cooking and cleaning, make dinner each day's one group meal and skip the restau - rants, Oransky advises. CAMPING TIPS Rent a group campsite. It's cost-effective and it's better for campers who aren't part of your group. Also book a covered pavilion to serve as the kitchen and gathering place. can sit by the pool. I have several favorite times of day. I get up early and we'll take some of the little kids to the beach around 6:30 or 7 , as the sun comes up. And then we go buy bagels. And dinner is great, because everybody's at the table. It's a lot of work to put to - gether, but it's an amazing experience for all of us. Most of our friends, once their kids are in their 40s, they don't go on vacations with them. But for us, this trip is a tradition. Every - body lo ves it. We talk about it all year. When we go away together, there are so many precious moments\u2014the little mo - ments that you can't plan. Be budget sensitive. A plan to print T-shirts ended when it turned out one family would need to buy eight. \"We try to do stuff that doesn't cost a lot,\" Acheson says. Tent and RV Rendezvous Destination: Gunnison County, Number of family members: 40-plus Trip organizer: Patti Acheson, age 72 WE'VE BEEN going to the Outer Banks (OBX) since the mid-1980s. Back then, it was just my wife and me and our four children. Now each child is married and we have eight grand-children. Sometimes a friend or two join us too. We've always gotten a beachfront house, and as we've grown in size, our house needs have grown. The one we had last time seemed to have two of everything: two refriger - ators, two freezers and two stoves, and a separate kitchen on a different floor. We used them all. The great thing about a house as opposed to a ho - tel is if you have little chil-dren, they can run around and be free. Sure, there are challenges. People are on different schedules and vacation differently. The really young children make a lot of noise. But you can always find your own place. You can go sit down on the beach.

We knew we wanted to go to the Caribbean, but we'd never planned for a group this big, and some of our friends and family would be coming from different cities. My daughter and son are good at organizing vacations, but my daughter said, \"This is too much.\" My daughter had worked before with a trav - el agent, Sheila Cannon of Carefree Romantic Vaca- tions, and Sheila came up with a Beaches resort in Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI). She was enormously helpful. My husband, Brian, knew nothing about the trip. He gets anxiety about traveling, so I have to \"kidnap\" him, as we like to put it. First, I put his pressure socks on him, which we always wear on flights. That's the signal. I then told him we were flying to Turks and Caicos, and WE STARTED saving for this trip several years ago, and my husband and I paid for everyone: my mother, two of our three children, their spous-es, and two grandchildren. Walt Disney World is complex. There are dif - ferent types of tickets; you can't just show up. We hired a travel agent, Lauren Cardi-nale, just to help us navigate the park. We all installed the Disney World app on our phones, and Lauren linked them together so one person could make reservations for all of us. It also had a GPS map so we could find our way around. The whole trip was eight days. My grand- children loved things like lunch at Beast's Castle, but I was thrilled they could spend time with my mother. It's true what they say: Theme parks are fun for kids and adults. AMUSEMENT PARK TIPS Hire an authorized Disney vacation planner . They have access to in - sider info like cr owd sizes and program changes. Plan some days off. Breeling scheduled free days be - tween park visits so the family could catch their collective breath. Get off-site lodging. Accommoda - tions for 10 or mor e are limited within the park. De - mand is high: Book a y ear in advance. we left that very day. I let on that our daughter and son would be there, but not our best friends or some of the other family. We arrived and got our welcoming drink at the resort, and then friends and family started sneaking in. He was overwhelmed. Happily over - whelmed. Because we'd recently had COVID, we arrived in Turks and Caicos a few days later than everyone else. 48 AARP THE MAGAZINE Magic Kingdom, here we come! Cathy and Brian Harney with their kids, Briana and Evan The All- Inclusive Beach Resort Vow Renewal Destination: Turks and Caicos Number of travelers: 16 2023 49I didn't know it, but Sheila had told my daughter that the resort offers free wedding ceremonies when you book three nights or more. One day we were outside and a young lady gave me a beautiful set of orchids and my husband a corsage, and we turned and saw all these chairs with a ga-zebo, and all of our family and friends, and I thought, Aha\u2014my children tricked me. We then renewed our vows for our 40th anniversary, and we sat in the gazebo on a tiny hill, looking out at the ocean with hors d'oeuvres and champagne. MULTIGEN HONEYMOON TIPS Ask first. Waters and Williams sent an online survey asking for every - one's interests, c oncerns and questions. Spread out the payments. Rath - er than asking f or a lump sum, they created a four-part pay - ment plan with deadlines. Centralize info. The couple built a website that detailed costs, itinerary, hotels, vaccine requirements and more. WATERS: As we researched this trip shortly after we got married, we kept think - ing, What about Africa? What if friends and family came with us? So we invited aunts, uncles, parents, nephews and close friends, and we went on a nine-day trip to Senegal. We didn't have the experience to organize it ourselves, but my research led us to Henderson Travel Service, the first Black travel agency in the U.S. We had conver - sations about what we wanted to explore, whether it was art and dancing or even tribal affiliations. They took our feedback and cu-rated a tailor-made trip. WILLIAMS : For my moth- er, going to Africa was a longtime dream. She said she felt profound joy, love, gratitude and peace there. For me it was less about the activities and more about watching the family bond. We built a village around each other. It was transfor - mative for all of us. A Bucket Senegal Number of travelers: 14Trip organizers: Monique Waters, age 37, and Norris Williams, age 36 BIG RESORT TIPS Check child policies. One family wanted to stay at a San - dals resort but disc overed it was adults only. If your group includes chil - dren, make sure y ou only book family-friendly resorts. Some all-inclusive resorts even let the kiddies stay free of charge. Ask about free rooms. For example, Sandals and Beaches resorts offer a free sixth or 12th room to large groups that stay a min - imum of three nights (black out dates apply). Spend time apart. With so many ages and interests, leave time for everyone to ex - plore their own vibe . Harney's group rarely ate breakfast or lunch together, for example, but always met for dinner. Assess your space. Many resorts only offer individu - al rooms. But some ha ve multi-bedroom suites or cabins. Ask attendees before you book; not everyone wants tha t level of togetherness.

The biggest challenge for me was making sure that everybody had the nec - essary paperwork to get on and off the ship. Every day for the last two weeks before we left, I sent texts saying, \"Please make sure you have your passports. If you're not using passports, make sure you have your ID and your birth certificates.\" I was terrified that someone would forget something. For most of us, seeing the Hubbard Glacier was the high point. And that was one of the reasons we got veranda rooms: so that we could see things together. The two years of COVID had kept us apart\u2014the family was trying to be really safe\u2014and some cracks had started to form in our relationships. That week on the cruise ship, being so close to - gether and just having a good time, we repaired those fractures. And I think my grandma would have been really happy about that. MY DAD'S PARENTS died in 2019. My grandma always wanted to take the whole family on a cruise, but my grandpa wouldn't go for it. When they passed away, my dad said, \"OK, we're gonna do what Grandma wanted.\" So we went on a cruise. The 22 people included my mom and dad, all of us six kids, our spous-es (one spouse couldn't go) and our children. The cruise got delayed twice because of COVID, and each time we rebooked it, we upgraded. My dad said, \"We've waited this long, let's pay the extra and put everybody in veranda rooms. And let's see if we can get us all together.\" We ended up with eight connected balcony rooms, and the kids could run and play in between the rooms. If you've never planned a cruise, step one is to talk with one of the cruise line's consultants. It saves you so much work, especially if you have a lot of people. We told her The Family Dream Cruise Destination: Alaska Number of travelers: 22 Trip organizer: Jenny Gillett, age 45 FAMILY CRUISE TIPS Have one negotiator. \"When talking to the consul - tant, I asked e verybody's questions,\" says Gillett. \"That way we weren't bombarding our consultant any more than I already was.\" Research the medical services.

Here are some truths about those extra pounds, and what they really mean to our health in this crucial decade of our livesBy Jessica Migala With Sari Harrar, Ginny Graves, Nicole Pajer and Beth Howard ILLUSTRATIONS BY CHRISTINE R\u00d6SCH 52 AARP THE MAGAZINE YOUR BODY AT 60 WHEN IT comes to weight, your 60s are a pivotal decade. A full 41.5 percent of adults ages 60 and older are consid-ered obese, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With age, your body accumulates more fat and deposits more of it around your middle, while at the same time you're losing mus-cle, all of which introduces higher odds for developing a cadre of health problems\u2014high blood pressure and cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea and a decline in physical functioning. Your weight isn't everything, but it can indicate how much body fat you're carrying. And body fat isn't just benign, sleepy stuff; it acts as an endocrine organ that's involved in the metabolism of sex hormones, blood clotting and blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity. Hitting that sweet spot\u2014not too much, not too little\u2014is important for aging well. Doctors use the 2023 53(body mass index) as one measure of body fat to determine whether you're underweight, healthy weight, overweight or obese. (Find yours at aarp.org/bmi.) In the general population, a BMI of less than 18.5 is underweight; 18.5 to 24.9 is healthy weight; 25 to 29.9 is considered over - weight; and 30 and over is obese, with a BMI 40 or higher indicating severe obesity. But those numbers might not apply so clearly to people in their 60s: One 2022 study found that the best BMI for health for those over age 65 is 27 to 28 in men and 31 to 32 for women. This is referred to as the obesity paradox, and exactly why it exists isn't fully understood, says Kristen DeCarlo, M.D., a geriatrician who practices in the areas of endo - crinology, diabetes and metabolism at UI Health in Chicago. That doesn't mean you should ignore weight gain. Consider your weight one indicator of your health, along with your blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels. But pay attention to where you're carrying those pounds, too. \"Visceral fat is the fat that's hid- den in your abdominal cavity,\" says Jean-Pierre Despr\u00e9s, a professor in the department of kinesiology at at Universit\u00e9 Laval in Quebec City, Canada. More visceral fat means more than just a wider waistline; it means a higher risk for heart dis-ease, diabetes and stroke. WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MY BODY? \"Our bodies are different in our 60s from when we were in our 20s and 30s,\" says Gitanjali Srivastava, M.D., medical director of Vanderbilt Obe - sity Medicine at Vanderbilt Univer - sity in Nashville. You may still be gaining fat: The fat gain you experienced in your 50s may continue into your 60s. \"For reasonably healthy adults, there's a natural increase in body fat until your 80s,\" says Obesity, particularly when there's lots of visceral fat present, is a risk factor for faster brain aging and Alzheimer's disease, says Howard Fillit, M.D., co- founder and chief science offic er at the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Founda - tion (ADDF). Belly fat has been sho wn to: Reduce blood flow to your brain, according to a 2020 study involving brain scans of mor e than 17,000 people. Researchers found that as w eight went up, blood flow in the brain went down, including to areas vulnerable to developing Alzheimer's. Shrink your brain. Using MRIs, research - ers from UCLA and the Univ ersity of Pittsburgh found that people who were overweight had 4 percent less brain volume, and their brains looked eight years older on average than those of people who were of normal weight. People who were obese had 8 percent less brain volume and brains that appeared 16 years older. Reduce your cogni- tive abilities. An elevated body mas s index (BMI) is directly associated with decreased attention, pro - cessing speed and fine mot or speed, according to a 2013 study. And in a 2016 study of 171 people with severe obesity, more than half met the criteria for mild cognitive impair -ment (MCI), even though their median age w as only 43. At a follow- up 12 months later, the preva - lence of MCI was reduced b y nearly 49 percent in those who had under - gone weight-loss surgery in the pr evious year. Protecting your brain means getting your weight under control. The MIND Diet, a mash-up of the heart-healthy Mediterranean and DASH diets, features lots of fruits and vegetables, plus lean protein and good fats like olive oil. You can still eat red meat, fast food and sweets, just limit your intake. People who most closely adhered to this eating pattern had a 53 percent lower rate of Alzheimer's. Your Weight and Your Brain When it comes to preserving brain health, your 60s may be the most important decade of all.changes and medication side effects, coupled with muscle loss and fat gain, add up to a body that now car - ries around proportionally more fat. Your muscles need protec- tion: It's generally believed that every pound lost through diet is about 75 percent fat and 25 percent muscle, says DeCarlo. If your doctor has advised you to lose weight, the key is to hold on to as much muscle as you can. Do that by consuming 15 to 25 percent of your calories from protein daily and regularly partici-pating in both aerobic exercise (150 minutes a week of walking, biking, jogging or swimming) and resistance exercise (weight lifting at least twice a week). You may lose as much as 3 percent of your overall muscle strength every year in your 60s. Men tend to hold on to more of their mus-cle power longer; for women, the decline happens quickly after age 65. Your metabolism is on the fritz: This is the decade when metabolism is starting to sputter. \"Weights and Measures,\" page 56.) Men should be under 40 inches; women should be less than 35 inches. Also: Check your pants. The butt may be baggier but the waist tighter. \"How your pants fit can be an accurate indicator of visceral fat,\" says Srivastava. Menopause has left a mark: By the time a woman is postmenopaus-al, 15 to 20 percent of her body fat is visceral fat, compared with just 5 to 8 percent when she was premeno - pausal. These changes are associated with higher blood pressure, choles-terol, insulin resistance and inflam-mation, according to a 2022 review at Columbia University.Your metabolism\u2014or the rate your body burns calories\u2014remains pretty stable in your adult years until your 60s. A 2021 study in Science found \"the break point\": age 63, after which metabolism goes on the decline. Your body requires fewer calories to keep it working (your heart beating, your lungs breathing); having less muscle also contributes to a more sluggish engine. Your waistline doesn't lie: There's a cheap and easy way to get an idea of how much of the concerning visceral fat (as opposed to subcutaneous fat\u2014more on this shortly) is setting up shop in your belly: Measure your waistline. (See People who have an \"apple\" shape body have more visceral fat within their bellies, while a person with a \"pear\" shape stores more fat in their hips and your neck may be get- ting thicker: Are the collars on your button-ups too tight? It's not the dry cleaner's doing. As we age, our muscles loosen and become laxer, and \"there can be more fat deposition in areas near the base of the tongue,\" says Srivastava. A neck size greater than 16 for women or 17 inches for men, she says, can be a sign that you're carrying excess fat in the neck, which can put you at risk for conditions like sleep apnea. WHY VISCERAL FAT IS NO GOOD As you age, the fat underneath your skin begins to reroute into your abdomen, where it becomes visceral fat, says Srivastava. Visceral fat is the deeper fat that lives within your bel-ly and hugs your stomach, liver and intestines. Your butt, legs, arms and face may appear thinner, but more visceral fat equals a wider waistline, and that distribution matters: \"Vis-ceral fat is the more dangerous fat to have,\" she says. When Austrian sci-entists scanned the bellies of 10,894 people for a 2020 study, they found that 20-year-olds had on average less than a pound of visceral fat. It surged to over 2 pounds for women and 4 pounds for men by their 60s. While many of us monitor our weight out of vanity, doctors sug - gest you consider monitoring your weight, BMI and waist measure - ment as important as monitoring your blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol levels. If they get out of control, you may be in danger. When scientists tracked 190,672 adults for 10 years or longer, obesity boosted the risk for heart attacks, strokes and heart failure\u2014and nearly tripled the odds for the most obese middle-aged group. And even those without obesity can be at increased risk from visceral fat, says Morgana Mongraw-Chaffin, assistant professor of epidemiolo - gy and prevention at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. 6 Most Effective Weight-Loss Steps to Take Today Start your day with protein. Studies show that \"protein timing\"\u2014eating 25 to 30 grams of pro - tein in the morn- ing, and the same amount a t lunch and dinner\u2014helps people at midlife and beyond maintain muscle mass, which in turn reduces fat gain. This is the basis of AARP's New York Times bestseller The Whole Body Reset. The average Amer - ican currently eats about 10 gr ams at breakfast and about 60 grams at dinner. Choose farm foods over factory foods. That means fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, seafood, olive and avocado oils, low-fat dairy and lean meat throughout the day. The fewer processed foods, the better. Foods in their natural form are the basis of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, which are consistent - ly rated as the best pr ograms for weight management, heart health and longevity. Move at least 30 minutes a day. Daily active living beats a few weekly gym sessions and sitting around the rest of the time. Aim for a total of at least 150 minutes of move - ment per week\u2014w alking swimming, biking, gardening\u2014for cardiovascular fitness, and at least two days a week of resistance training for muscular strength, as recommended b y the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cut down on sim- ple carbohydrates, especially sugar . That means minimiz - ing cookies, sodas and other s weets. Simple carbs not only fill you up with calories while provid - ing minimal nutrition, but a higher carbo - hydrate intake leads t o water retention, making you look, feel and weigh heavier. Stop eating at 7 p.m. Eating later in the evening increases your next-day hun - ger, decreases your ne xt-day calorie burn and triggers your body to store more fat, according to a recent study. Go to bed at least seven hours before you need to wake up. Ghrelin is the hormone created in the stomach that signals us to eat. Sleeping less than seven hours a night has been shown to elevate ghrelin, meaning you may be driven to consume more calories the next day.EAT LESS, MOVE MORE: Losing weight comes down to just those four words, right? Not really. Decades of research show that effective weight loss involves food choices as much as, if not more than, food volume. And certain lifestyle choices significantly affect success or failure. These six steps are widely accepted as key to effective weight loss. She conducted a study of 1,005 midlife women and men, none of whom had obesity. But those with higher levels of abdominal fat raised their risk for diabetes by 51 percent and doubled their risk for metabolic syndrome\u2014a collection of risk factors including low levels of heart-helping HDL cholesterol, high levels of ticker-menacing tri-glycerides and above-normal blood pressure and/or blood sugar. The good thing about visceral fat is that you can lose it quickly: One study found that just four weeks of brisk walking resulted in an inch reduction in waist circumference. \"With exercise, you can lose visceral fat even if you don't lose weight\" says Despr\u00e9s. Reducing your waist by about 1.5 inches can reduce risk for diabetes by 60 percent. WEIGHT, CANCER AND IMMUNITY There's another common killer that becomes more preva- lent as we reach our 60s: cancer. Rates increase from about 350 cases per 100,000 people in those age 45 to 49 to more than 1,000 per 100,000 people in those 60 and older. One reason, according to the National Institutes of Health, is the decline in the immune system's ability to detect and correct cell defects. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, obesity is linked to at least 13 types of cancer. Some are hormone-related: Obesity creates inflammation, which disrupts the immune system, and causes dysregulation of the hor - monal system. \"Obesity leads to an increase in certain hormones that lead to an increase in cancer: breast, endometrial, thyroid, pancreas and so forth,\" says Omar Ghanem, M.D., a metabolic surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minne -1Step on the scale. Azagury suggests weighing yourself weekly, as your weight can fluctuate day-to-day based on a number of factors. Always use the same scale, and always weigh yourself before getting into or after getting out of the shower\u2014a pair of jeans alone can add more than a pound to your weight. 2Measure your waist circum - ference. Plac e a tape measure just above your hip bones. Generally, a waist size above 35 inches for women or 40 inches for men means you're at higher risk for heart disease or type 2 diabetes, according to the National Institutes of Health. Another popular gauge: If your waist size is more than half your height, you might be at greater risk of disease. 3Calculate your BMI. You can find a useful calcula - tor at aarp.org/bmi. W hile BMI will indicate whether you're a healthy weight, over - weight or obese , remem - ber it's only one da ta point. BMI can underestimate body fat percentage in older adults who have lost muscle mass, and it can overestimate fat in people who are particularly muscular. That said, a BMI of 35 or higher is a pretty clear line: \"Most experts would agree that this could lead to weight-related disease in older adults,\" says geriatri - cian Kristen DeCarlo. 4 Find your hip-to-waist ratio. Measure the width of your hips at the top of the hip bones. Now take the waist circumfer- ence number and divide it b y your hip circumference. Women should have a ratio of 0.85 or less, while men should not e xceed 0.9. Higher ratios mean a greater risk of cardiovascular disease. 5 Splurge for a scientific scan. There are a number of ways for health professionals to measure body fat, including underwater hydrostatic weighing, air displacement plethysmography (ADP) and dual- energy X-ray absorp- tiometry (DEXA). T hese are mostly available at research facilities, although some hospitals, high-end weight-loss clinics and gyms might have access to them. Are they necessary? Not unless you're an elite athlete.Weights & Measures \"WE'RE REALLY BAD AT estimating how our weight is doing,\" says Dan Azagury, M.D., medical director for the Stanford Lifestyle and Weight Management Clinic. To get an idea of whether those extra pounds are weighing on your health: sota. \"Those connections are well established, and we know that losing weight with bariatric surgery can reduce the risk,\" he says. Bariatric surgery has been shown to reduce cancers that aren't related to hormone levels. In a recent anal-ysis of 15 studies, including a total of nearly 950,000 people with obesity who underwent bariatric surgery and more than 17 million who didn't, the researchers found that the surgery group had an almost 50 percent reduction in the risk of liver, colorectal, kidney, urinary tract, esophageal and lung cancers. Obesity is also a risk factor for developing an autoimmune dis-ease, a problem that becomes more common with age, particularly in women. These diverse conditions, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, occur when the immune system starts 2023 57with obesity who lost 18 percent of their body weight after weight-loss surgery revealed that within just three months the patients' immune systems were measurably healthier, with reduced white blood cell levels and reduced inflammation. HOW WE THINK ABOUT WEIGHT Conventional wisdom once said \"feeling fat\" was strictly a young person's problem. Now, a wave of research is uncovering long-over - looked struggles\u2014and newfound wisdom\u2014about weight and body image for people in their 60s. \"It's not like you grow out of a negative body image,\" says psychologist and body image researcher Lisa Kilpela, an assistant professor at the Univer - sity of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. \"There are a lot of reasons to suspect it could get worse with age for some people.\" Over half of women in their 60s own healthy tissues. \"People with rheumatoid arthritis in particular have premature immune aging,\" says Cornelia Weyand, M.D., an immune system researcher at the Mayo Clin-ic in Rochester, Minnesota. \"Their immune age is about 25 years older than their actual age.\" The last three years have driv - en home how obesity can impact the immune system. Researchers recently looked at how weight affected outcomes for some 150,000 COVID patients. They learned that patients with a BMI of 30 to 34.9 ( just above the \"obesity\" thresh-old) were 7 percent more likely to be hospitalized and 8 percent more likely to die than people who were a healthy weight. Those with a BMI of 45 or higher (considered \"morbidly\" obese) were 33 percent more likely to be hospitalized and 61 percent more likely to die. But the immune system can re - bound if you bring your weight un-der control. A 2022 study at Brigham and Women's Hospital of people say weight or body shape concerns have a negative impact on their lives. In one large University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill survey, up to 64 percent thought about their weight every day. Men aren't ex - empt. Half in a small Canadian study of men ages 60 to 83 said they felt unattractive because of their weight. Body dissatisfaction made 17 percent of men and 39 percent of women ages 50 to 65 uncomfortable wearing a bathing suit in public, according to a UCLA survey of over 52,000 U.S. adults. But in your 60s, a negative body image can have far more serious consequences: Binge-eating was a problem for up to 26 percent of women ages 55 to 83 in a recent study by Kilpela and others. \"For the longest time, people didn't think older women had eating disorders,\" Kilpela says. \"Older women who come to our lab say things like, 'Thank you for thinking of us. We thought we'd be the for - gotten ones because of our age.'\" Body dissatisfaction is associat - ed with higher risk of depression, poorer sleep and less than optimal self-care. \"It's like the way you treat an old pair of sneakers versus a brand-new pair,\" says Kilpela. Of course, not everyone in their 60s battles big-time body dissat - isfaction, says psychiatrist Debra Safer, M.D., an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University who special-izes in treating eating and weight disorders. In a study of body image and \"fat talk\" in women ages 18 to 87 , just 12 percent of those 61 and older said they harangued themselves frequently about their weight\u2014the lowest number of any age category in the study. \"Self-compassion is the antidote,\" Safer says. \"Compassion for all your body has allowed you to do and still enables you to do.\" n \"It's not like you grow out of a negative body image,\" says psychologist and body image researcher Lisa Kilpela. \"There are a lot of reasons to suspect it could get worse with age for some people.\" Journalist Jessica Migala writes regularly on health and wellness for Glamour, Health, Men's Health and other publications.

Some Americans may have thought this prejudice was fading away, but it has gained momentum once again. What to make of today's attacks on Jews, and what can be done about it ILLUSTRATION BY DOUG CHAYKAInterviews by Jane EisnerThe pro - jected onto a building in West Palm Beach, Florida. Antisemitic flyers thrown onto lawns in Atlanta suburbs. A Kanye West post on social media announcing, \"I'm going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE.\" Eleven wor - shippers killed in an attack on a synagogue in Pittsburgh. To understand what's behind this current wave of antisemitic beliefs and incidents, we turned to Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, the State Department's special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism. A longtime professor of Jewish studies at Emory University, Lipstadt has written several award-winning books about the Holocaust and other aspects of modern Jewish history. Let's start with the basics. In the U.S. today, there's no simple picture of Jewish life. You have Jews who are extremely observant\u2014who follow strict dietary laws, who dress a certain way, who don't work or drive from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday. At the other end of the spectrum, you have people who maybe go to synagogue once a year and iden-tify as Jewish. In this context, how do you define antisemitism? What does it look like today? It's a prejudice like other prejudices\u2014a hatred of Jews. But it's also a conspiracy theory that cuts across ideologies, nationalities, ethnicities. It's someone who says, \" Jews are all-powerful. They control the media. They control the banks, the government.\" Or, \" Jews are all privileged.\" It comes from Christians, it comes from Muslims, it comes from atheists. It even comes from other Jews. One sees it in a variety of forms\u2014on the governmental level, in the media, on the streets. It looks like it's increasingly normalized. That's what's frightening to me. That it's OK. Is it really different from other preju dic es, like racism or sexism? Jews don't fit the picture of your traditional vic - tims of prejudice: \"If you look so secure and so successful, what are you complaining about?\" So, the Jewish kid on scholarship in my class at Emory\u2014who's also doing work on the side so she won't graduate with $100,000 in debt\u2014has to justify that she's not privileged. Whereas with prejudice against other groups, this lack of privilege is tak en at face value. We may present as educated and financially secure, even though we know very well there are many Jews who are not. There's another way in which antisemitism is different from other prejudices. With most racial and other prejudices, people simply look down upon the other. But antisemites punch down and punch up simultaneously. They look down on Jews and see them as lesser human beings\u2014dirty. And they look up and see them as more powerful, as con-niving and as a threat to the antisemite's well-being. And if Jews pose a danger to your well-being because they are conniving and crafty, then you have to protect yourself by any means necessary. And yet, in contemporary America, there's also an admiration of Jews. Intermarriage rates are high. How do you make sense of that? Jews are much admired for their accomplishments, but sometimes that admiration can turn on a dime into hostility. What sort of mistakes do we make in our thinking about antisemitism? One mistake we make is to fail to take it seriously. And that has a number of consequences, one particular and one more universal. The particular: If there is a group in your society\u2014a racial group, ethnic group, religious group, whatever it might be\u2014 that is under attack, you as members of that society and certainly the government of that society have a responsi-bility to protect that group. A government's main job is to protect its citizens. That alone would make it a legitimate enterprise for a government to fight antisemitism. But there's a bigger danger to allowing antisemitism to exist, and that's because antisemitism, like other forms of prejudice, is a canary in the coal mine and a threat to democr acy. Remember, it's a conspiracy theory that Jews control the media, the banks, the election process, etc. If you believe that there is a group controlling these things, then essentially you're saying that you don't be - lieve in democr acy. So, this belief is a danger to a particu- lar group in your society, and it's also heralding the death knell of democracy. Is the current state of antisemitism in the U.S. different from past iterations? It isn't different in that it uses the traditional stereotypes and the traditional accusations. What's different today is the delivery system. When I first started working on Holocaust denial, if I wanted material that deniers were sending, I had to go to an archive that collected this material. Now you've got a delivery system online that spreads this material everywhere and very quickly. Is there a connection between antisemi- tism and political beliefs? Antisemitism comes from all places on the political spectrum. Right now the much stron-ger manifestation of physical danger comes from extremist right-wing, white supremacist, white nationalist groups. The guards in front APRIL / MAY 2023 59ANTISEMITISM'S LOSS IN COURT In 2000 , Lipstadt won a high- profile libel case br ought against her by a Holo - caust denier\u2014 a legal battle r ecounted in her book History on Trial and depicted in the 2016 fea - ture e's no synagogue that doesn't have some sort of guard in front of it these days\u2014are guarding against either right-wing militias or Islamic terrorism. They're not guarding against a progressive person coming down the street. But on many college campuses, you hear of Jewish stu- dents having to defend their Jewish identity. They have to downplay it instead of being proud of who they are. In a study I read recently, for example, one student said she iden - tified herself as a Jew in one course. And for the rest of the semester, any time she commented on anything, her Jewish identity would be shoved back at her. Whereas five or six years ago, students on campus had a whole dif - ferent experience. It's a fool's errand to get into a debate as to which type of antisemitism is worse. One may be more dangerous than the other, but that doesn't mean that all kinds shouldn't be dealt with seriously. And that gets us to campus protests about Israel. How do we draw a line between legitimate criticism of Israel and antisemitism? Criticism of Israeli policy is not antisemitism, just like criti- cism of American policy is not anti-Americanism. But when it begins to ascribe to Israel antisemitic characteristics\u2014 that the Jewish state is all-powerful, that it is rich, con-niving, and all you have to do is take out the word \"Israel\" and put in \" Jew\"\u2014then you're on that slippery slope of prejudice. If you question the right of Israel to exist because it's a Jewish state but fail to question the right of Islamic states to exist because of their religious identity, you have to won-der why. Some people say that Israel doesn't have a right to exist because it chased out an Indigenous population. There's a big debate about whether that's correct, but let's say for the moment that the Jews displaced the Indigenous population. What about the United States of America and the Native Americans? What about Canada and the First Nations? What about Australia and the Aboriginal people? I'm not justifying any of these things. I'm asking, \"Why in this one case do they say, 'Israel doesn't have a right to exist,' and not these other countries?\" When you hold it to a different standard, when you subject it to this singular focus and ignore others, then you have to ask, \"Where is that coming from?\" Why should non-Jews care about antisemitism? It's a great question, and I would say the following. Antisemitism, which has a long, terrible history, has never Jewish Americans Speak Out SOME OF THE older members of our synagogue remember when they were more concerned about being mugged than being berated as a Jew. Now it's the reverse. If you've never experienced anti- semitism before, it's extremely un - nerving. I experienced much worse as a child gr owing up in Moscow. For me, New York is an incredible place for Jews to live. And yet, for the first time since I came here, many American Jews look at America as a place where they won't be able to stay for long. That's the greatest shift over the past decade. \"It's extremely unnerving.\"20% of Americans hold at least six different anti- Jewish beliefs, ac cording to a survey by the Anti-Defama tion League. Rabbi Benjamin Goldschmidt leads the Altneu, an Ortho- dox synagogue founded last year in Manhattan.led to good things for society at large. We've seen in the lifetime of people still walking the face of this earth what it can do. One out of every three Jews in the world were murdered by the Nazis. Had the Germans won the war, they probably would have eliminated lots of other people\u2014lots of Ukrainians, Slavs, Mongols. Only the destruction of the Jews could not wait. Antisemitism injects hatred into society. It injects contempt into society, and distrust. It breeds no good. In some European countries, Holocaust denial is illegal. Should antisemitic speech be curtailed her e in the United States? Oh, no. That would be impossible, because of the First Amendment. But we can make it unacceptable. The use of the n-word is not illegal, but it's increasingly unacceptable, and that's a good thing. Even people who use it in their heads increasingly know that it's unacceptable in respect - able society. So, what works to confront antisemitism, and what doesn't work? What I think is absolutely essential is people speaking up, people speaking out, whether it's the host of a dinner party or the person who has 38 million followers on TikTok. We have to make the antisemite into the social pariah. It's not to be rationalized. It's incumbent on everyone to speak out, to make it clear that it's unacceptable. There's no standing silent. When you hear or encounter any form of oppression, any form of discrimination, if you stay silent, then you've sided with the oppressor.

LIVING WITH 2023 61make us biased against the whole group. If you don't base your ideas on facts or never adjust them, biases start to affect how you act. PREJUDICE CAN BE CONTAGIOUS.

This leads t o discrimination\u2014whole groups of people being treated unequally on the basis of group prejudice. SO SPEAK UP ... If some - one around you does something based on pr eju- dice, make yourself heard. Ask tha t person to tone it down, and say that you're not OK with offensive prejudices, whether or not they affect you personally. ... USING YOUR COMMON SENSE. That, plus empathy and humor, will be your most important assets. If you end up in a debate, questions may be more ef - fective than facts, figures and ar guments. Question - ing others can lead them t o question themselves over the long run. WE TEND TO think of antisemitism in the narrow aspect of \"What are people saying about Jews?\" The larger frame to look at is when anyone in our society is outside the social contract\u2014when there's an \"us\" and a \"them.\" That raises the likeli - hood that antisemitism will increase. T oo many times the mantra in the Jewish community is that antisem - itism is unique. I get it. But it's not lik e Jews are the only people to be hurt by the human capacity to hate. If we don't look at what we know about how human beings are divided into \"us\" and \"them,\" we lose a larger understanding of what antisemitism is. n Interviews have been edited for length and clarity.\"More people need to be educated about Judaism.\"\"It's not like Jews are the only people to be hurt by the human capacity to hate.\"FOR TWO YEARS during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, a young Jewish girl, Anne Frank, hid with her family in the secret annex of an Amsterdam office until they were discovered and deported. Frank died in a German concentration camp in 1945 at age 15, but the diary she kept Timeless Wisdom About Prejudice while in hiding, published after her death, became a w orld-famous testament to a life cut short by hate. The building where she hid is now a museum and center that teaches about bias and discrimination. These insights, adapted from the website of the Anne Frank House (annefrank.org), are instructive to us all. FOR A LONG time, American Jews believed that staying in our own communities was the safest thing to do. I can see that. The challenge with that today is the internet. Once something is online, you have no control over where it goes. I sit at the intersection of Blackness and Jewishness. It's my daily lived experience. I see that people can be racist and antisemitic regardless of their political perspective. More people need to be edu - cated about Judaism. We should get o ver the fear that we had about sharing our Jewishness. It's not helping the community. It's helping antisemitism to exist. ALL OF US PUT LABELS ON OTHERS ...

It's a tradition that binds people young and old to places and enterprises, and to ways of life that are becoming rarer and rarer as farm life is squeezed out by modern ways By Sarah Mahoney Photographs by Andy AndersonCELEBRATING AMERICA 62 AARP THE MAGAZINE Family Farms both 81, can't remember a time when farming wasn't their dream. His ancestor arrived from Ireland in 1752 and got this farm in 1786. That makes David the sixth generation of his family to work the 100-acre property, which the Greenes have turned into a successful sheep- raising operation. \"I gr ew up on a smaller farm about 10 miles away,\" David says. \"The farm we're on now came down from my mother's side of the family\u2014her father grew up here. This is where we had family gatherings and reunions. It always felt like home. And it feels good to succeed at something difficult.\" \"When we started dating,\" Nancy says, \"we'd come up here and see his relatives, and I loved this place right away.\" The couple sell wool and livestock, but their main income sour ce is meat. \"We're pretty efficient, especially now that we only sell directly,\" David says. \"People come to the farm to get their orders two days a week.\" With no children, the Greenes know that the farm may be sold eventually. \"I'm a realist,\" David says. \"It would be nice if I went out the road first, before the sheep did. I would be very happy with that. I'd rather not be the one who sells it.\" APRIL / MAY 2023 63 Sheep GREENE'S LAMB WHITE HALL, MARYLAND From top: Nancy and David Greene with one of their two restored antique tractors; a The Vetter farm dates back to the late 19th century, when pio - neers streamed into Nebr aska's Hamilton County. By 1908, Stephen Vetter's gr andfather was successfully farming. Eventually, Steve's dad was, too. Steve, now 74, moved to Lincoln, became a pharmacist and married Doris, 73, a high school English teacher. But by 1980, farming had lured him back. In 2011, he retired; his son Curran stepped in to run the 900-acre operation. Doris and Steve cur - rently live in Aurora and visit the f arm often to spend time with Curran; his wife, Megan; and grandkids Phoebe and Micheal. Two other sons live nearby. \"When all the grandchildren are playing in that big yard, you remember past generations doing those same things,\" Doris says. Some change is welcome. \"We're always trying some - thing, to diversify and not jus t rely on corn and soybeans,\" says Megan. \"So we have chickens and bees, and we've started a Christmas tree farm.\" Through the Dust Bowl, hail, tornadoes and constantly fluc - tuating crop prices, \"f arming has been a really good life,\" says Doris.

His son W ill, 46, graduated from college in 2000, earned an MBA from Harvard and then went to work for General Mills. \"There wasn't much reason to come home,\" Will says. \"I had a good job. The market for ginseng was horrible. And there's nothing that's especially fun about picking rocks or man - aging pests.\" But when P aul was diagnosed with cancer in 2010, Will, his oldest son, came home, and over the next five years the farm's management slowly shifted to him. \"I knew the farm was where I needed to be,\" Will says. Today, with Will at the helm, the 1,000-acre farm is a global operation, producing more than 200,000 pounds of ginseng annually. With new manage - ment came new ways of doing things: \"I used to dig posts and pick rocks by hand,\" recalls Paul. \"Now we have mechanical harvesters and post pounders that line ev - erything up perfectly, using GPS. \" Still, Paul keeps his hand in. \"I focus on the part of the business I love, which is spending time in the woods. It can take 10 years for the roots to fully mature, but it's nice to see them coming in. It makes me so hopeful about the future.\" \u2014David Hochman Will Hsu, left, enjoys a light moment with his father, Paul, during the ginseng harvest. APRIL / MAY 2023 65Ginseng HSU'S GINSENG FARM WAUSAU, WISCONSIN Photograph by Tzu-Fang Tseng Set on Washing- ton's stunning Hood Canal and the clear , cold Hamma Ham - ma River, the farm began as a timber business in 1922. Third-generation owner Bart Robbins, who died in 2021, sold shrimp on the side to make ends meet. Soon he add -ed oysters, develop- ing a devoted Seattle following. Bart 's son, Dave, 71, and daughter, Helena James, 74, are retired after decades in the busi - ness. But Helena's son A dam, 44, and her daughter, Lissa James Monberg, 41, run the oyster farm. (Their brother, Tom, 46, and his wife, Kendra, 44, head up the company.) Adam and Lissa both left home for college, travel and other jobs but later came back. \"I was in middle school when I realized that I was one of the luckiest people on the planet, to be in the woods here, and especially on the water,\" Lissa says. The family's retail business was low-key for decades. But ever since Lissa took that over in 2005 and started online sales, then opened the Oyster Saloon in 2014, business has boomed. \"I wonder what my grandparents would think,\" marvels Helena. \"Could they ever have imagined us selling oysters on the internet?\" n Oysters HAMA HAMA OYSTER FARM LILLIWAUP, WASHINGTON From top: Adam James harvesting oysters; a handful of freshly picked Blue Pool oysters; Helena James chatting with her YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFIT BE?

But do you have similar smarts about your vital money measurements?

DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH INSURANCE COVERAGE? DO YOU HAVE CASH RESERVES? counting on a home sale to supercharge your retirement savings, buy your next home or pay for long-term care. But the amount you'd actually get when you sell may be very different from the estimate you see online. DIVE DEEPER To get an estimate of your home's current value, try the websites Redfin or Zillow, or ask a local broker for an analysis based on recent sales in your area. Subtract from that your mortgage balance and any other housing debt. The result is your home equity. But a sale will net you less than that. Expect to spend 9 to 10 percent of your sales price on commissions, closing and other costs, says Jacob Channel, a senior economist at LendingTree. Preparing your home for sale may cost you. Some good news: If you meet cer - tain conditions, your first $250,000 in profit from the sale is free from federal taxes. (That's for singles; $500,000 is excluded for couples.) Q. Your water heater just died, and it'll be $1,500 to replace it. Are you panicking? MEASURE: CASH RESERVES Financial crises are easier to handle if you have access to cash that isn't earmarked for your regular expenses. Without an emergency fund, you may have to take on expensive debt or sell investments at a loss if you have unexpected bills or you lose your job. DIVE DEEPER Ask yourself this question: How much extra money do you have in the bank other than Q. Last month, did you spend more or less money than you brought in? MEASURE: CASH FLOW Positive cash flow\u2014more money coming in than going out\u2014is a timeless, fundamental principle of financial health. DIVE DEEPER Add up how much money you bring home each month from work, Social Security or a pension. Then review several months of credit card statements and bank statements to total up your outlays. Subtract average monthly spending from average income. You want the result to be positive, not negative. Are you a retiree tapping your in- vestments for income? In that case, aim to keep your withdrawals under 4 percent of retirement savings per year to meet your spending needs, recommends Patrick Carney, a financial adviser with Rodgers & As-sociates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. If the cost of shelter, food and health care leaves you little or no cash for anything else, consid-er making major changes, such as trading down to a smaller dwelling. And take a hard look at your discretionary spending, says Kathryn Peyton, a financial planner at Abacus Wealth Partners in Sebasto - pol, California: \"Ask yourself, 'Are those really the categories I want to be spending money on, and, if not, how do I change my patterns?'\" the working cash you need to get through the month? Ideally, this extra cash is in a separate account that you'd be less likely to dip into for everyday expenses. \"Everyone's emergency fund is going to look different, but everyone should have one,\" says Kristen Grif - fith, a counselor with the Pittsburgh Financial Empowerment Center. She suggests you focus more on the process of building one than on a precise amount to aim for. \"Savings is about the habit and less about the amount,\" she says. \"Start with $1 or $25, but make it automatic so you don't have to think about it.\"Q. If you were to sell your home right now, how much cash would you walk away with? DID YOU KNOW? In 2020, the median home equity for homeowners ages 65 to 69 was $190,000.MEASURE: HOME WEALTH APRIL / MAY 2023 have likely changed since you first bought life insurance, but you may still need it if the loss of income from your paid work, or the cost of replacing your unpaid labor, will cause hardship for your survivors. DIVE DEEPER Did you buy a 20- or 30-year term policy? Consult your copy to check the expiration date and other terms. (If you can't find the paperwork, reach out to your insurer or agent.) You may need insurance beyond the original term if, for example, you have a special-needs child who will always depend on you financially. You may be able to convert your term policy to a permanent one without factoring in changes to your health. If you need insur - ance only for a limited time\u2014say, until your mortgage is paid off\u2014you could just get a new 10-year term policy if you're relatively healthy, Cortazzo says. Q. What is the highest interest rate you're paying on any debt? MEASURE: DEBT MANAGEMENT The higher the interest rate on a particular loan or credit card, the bigger the benefit of paying it off as quickly as you can. Let's say, for example, that you have 10 years remaining on a 30-year, 4 percent fixed-rate mortgage, and you're also carrying a big balance on a credit card with an interest rate of 21 percent. Put an extra $1,000 toward your mortgage and you've cut your interest costs by an average of $48 per year. Put that same amount toward your credit card balance and you've saved yourself $234 in interest in a single year. DIVE DEEPER Find the rate you're paying on each of your debts by looking at your monthly statements. If you don't want loan repayments to burden you in retirement, it's a good idea to aggressively focus on higher -rate debt such as credit cards, says Gerri Detweiler, who writes about credit and other topics. Comparing the rates on your debt to the interest on your savings may also spur you to use more cash for payoffs. \"It's amazing how often I'll see someone with a lot of money in the bank earning 2 or 3 percent, and with credit card debt or a home equity line of credit at a 7 to 9 percent rate,\" says Mark Cortazzo, a finan-cial adviser at Wealth Enhancement Group in Parsippany, New Jersey. Q. When you saw your final income tax bill (or refund) this year, was the amount far different from what you expected? MEASURE: TAX MANAGEMENT Keeping up with your tax situa - tion thr oughout the year can help you avoid a big bill at tax time (and possible penalties) or a long wait for a refund when you could have used the extra money during the year. DIVE DEEPER Owing money with your return is a common hazard for people who have income in the form of freelance work, taxable invest - ment returns or withdrawals from a traditional IRA, 401(k) or 403(b). If that applies to you, avert tax-time pain by having your retirement account administrator withhold taxes from your distributions (as you might with a paycheck; 10 percent is a standard amount), or by making estimated tax payments throughout the year. These payments are usually made on a quarterly basis to the IRS and to states levying an income tax. For more information, go to irs.gov and search for form 1040-ES. Another alternative to paying estimated tax - es: Increase withholding from your paycheck if you're in the workforce.DID YOU KNOW? Last year, two- thirds of taxpayers received refunds, on average nearly $3,200.Q. If you get hit by a bus, how large an insurance payment will your survivors receive? MEASURE: FAMILY SECURITY columnist at Kiplinger's Personal Finance, is the author of Rescue Your Financial Life. Q. If you haven't claimed So - cial Security yet, how much will you get? And if you're married, what will the sur - vivor receive monthly after the other spouse's death? MEASURE: RETIREMENT READINESS Social Security may be your main source of guaranteed lifetime income in retirement, especially if you don't have a pension. DIVE DEEPER Sign up for a My Social Security account on the Social Secu-rity Administration's website (ssa.gov/myaccount). You'll find estimates of your benefits based on your work record and different claiming ages; The ratio of stocks and stock funds to bonds and bond funds in your portfolio is generally a tension between risk and reward. Stocks typically offer higher potential returns, but they're also more prone to downturns. DIVE DEEPER Your latest retirement account statement should have a table or pie chart showing you what percentage of your total holdings is in stocks and what percentage is in bonds or cash. As you age, it's important to dial back on risk\u2014but not completely. \"Generally, 50/50 is a minimum for most people look - ing at retirement,\" says Carney, \"but for most people, 60/40 [stocks/bonds] makes most sense.\" Your risk tolerance is also a key factor; if you're going to sell stocks in a panic, you have the wrong mix, he says. An easy way to manage risk is to invest in what's known as a target-date fund. Its holdings automati-cally shift toward a more conservative mix as your retirement date nears.Q. Yes, you're a wonderful human being, and you can't put a dollar value on that. But how much are you worth? MEASURE: NET WORTH Your net worth\u2014simply put, how much you have minus how much you owe\u2014can be a guidepost on the road map to your future. \"It helps you get a sense of how many resources you have if you need to tap them,\" Cortazzo says. DIVE DEEPER Add up the value of all of your savings, investments, property and other assets. (Stick with the big assets\u2014your house and car, not your sofa, shoe collection or silverware.) From that number, subtract all of your debts. Use the resulting figure\u2014your net worth\u2014as a jumping-off point for some other questions. For example, what can you do, by way of increasing assets or decreasing debts, to improve your net worth? If you end up facing a major expense\u2014say, long-term care\u2014where could you get the money to pay for it? How much could you raise by selling assets? \"If you look at your invest - ments and home equity, that helps you see the resources available to supple - ment guaranteed income sources like Social Security. That can give you a much better sense of where the mon-ey can come from,\" Cortazzo says. nalthough those figures will be pre - sented based on current dollars, over time adjustments may be made to keep pace with inflation. Knowing these estimates now can help you better plan for retirement. Seeing your estimated monthly payments at different ages can also reveal the value of delaying claiming, if that's possible for you. While you can start receiving reduced bene - fits as early as age 62, your monthly benefit will increase each month you delay claiming up until you turn 70. Married couples should know that after one spouse dies, the other will receive only one monthly benefit, not two: the higher of his or her current benefit and the survivors benefit. DID YOU KNOW? People ages 55 to 64 with retirement accounts hold an average of 62% in stocks. MEASURE: INVESTMENT RISKQ. If you have retirement savings, roughly what percentage of it is in stocks?

Now she's a sensation WHEN MY business\u2014a dance studio\u2014shut down in 2020 due to the pandemic, it was crushing for me. I'd left a corporate accounting job in 2009 to launch the studio, so I could be home more with my seven children. Now it looked like my life's work was going down the drain. I wondered, What am I going to do? There was lots of prayer. Around this time, I saw my kids looking at TikTok. I would ask to make videos with them, but they would say, \"No, it's not for you.\" Still, I would see people on the app doing dances to old-school songs and think, That's not how you dance hip-hop. So I took matters into my own hands. I pulled out the old-school moves and told the camera, \"This is how you dance to this song.\" That video went viral, and I got 300,000 followers within 14 days. I was, like, \"What just happened?\" Then I started creating my own cho - reography. Now I have over a million followers across all platforms. Hip-hop is a whole movement. I don't want us to forget how it started. You've got to have the Running Man. You've got to have the Cabbage Patch. Those dances take us back to a time where things were a lot simpler.

My brothers used to take me there, and I was just amazed at the beauty of it. It's 22 acres of nature south of downtown, with streams, trails and a reflecting pond. We'd go sledding there in the winter and slide down hills on cardboard in the summer. But then my parents divorced, and we moved to a different part of town. I graduated from high school and got odd jobs, then worked in the beer industry. And as soon as I could, I bought my own place, back near McKinley Park. But I had a problem with alcohol. I've fought it my whole life. For many years I was sober, but over seven years in my late 40s, I lost almost everything, including the gal and the job. The park was going downhill, too\u2014overgrown and dirty. And then in 2010, doctors told me I had prostate cancer. They said to try to quit drinking. After my cancer surgery, I knew I had to do some - thing to keep myself occupied so I wouldn't drink. I was just barely hanging on. One day, I grabbed a bucket, went outside and started picking up garbage on the street. I ran into my neighbor Larry, who asked, \"Why don't you help me in the park?\" So I started volunteering with Larry, who was working to beautify McKinley Park. The work gave me purpose and relieved my depression. Between that and a 12-step program, I've been able to stay sober, and my prostate cancer hasn't come back. I volunteered with Larry until he became ill and passed away. Now I continue what he started. When I began at the park, I used to count the used hypodermic needles I was picking up. After I had col-lected over 5,000 needles, I stopped counting. There are a lot fewer of them now, though. The homeless encampments that used to be all over the park are gone. Whenever I meet someone homeless at the park, I try to find services for them, a place where they can go. I never talk down to them, because I've been there. Since I retired in 2013, I've put 1,200 hours a year into the park. Peo - ple say I saved the park, but the way I look at it, the park saved me. To me, it's a magical place. I never knew that taking care of the park would change my life, but it did\u2014one day at a time. \u2014As told to Charles R. Cross PHOTOGRAPH BY NASHCO APRIL / MAY 2023 75REAL/PEOPLE Creating Cowboys day. Learning and pushing myself. And that's what I do with the actors. There are some who have never been around horses before, and you can tell that they are fearful. If a person is afraid of an animal, it reads on film. So, before filming a season of Y ellowstone, for example, we do a cowboy camp, where we get the actors out working with their horses. I would rather work with someone who knows nothing about horses than someone who went on trail rides in the fifth grade. It's hard to unlearn bad habits, whereas if they come in with a clean canvas, I can teach them a lot. Any horse trainer will tell you that you have to look where you're going, not where you've been. When horses are pulling a buggy or wagon, the driver really has to look ahead on the road, so they can send the horses to that point. If the driver is looking directly down at the horses, there is no guidance for them. That's like driving a car while looking at the steering wheel. But people eventually get it. Every - one is teachable. As I tell the actors I work with, \"What you find difficult today will be your warm-up tomor - row.\" \u2014As told to Tom Chiarella'Everyone Is Teachable' Animal trainer Diane Branagan has a way with creatures\u2014and people AT THE BEGINNING of my career, 29 years ago, I worked for a company that trained horses, camels, lions, tigers, dogs and cats. That was my introduction to handling ani-mals on film and TV sets. I've been exposed to everything\u2014primates, big cats. My first film experience was on Titanic, where I trained the dogs and rats. I still do dogs and sometimes wolves, but I have narrowed it down. Now, I primarily do horses. You have to remember\u2014that's an animal. It has a different brain. It can't talk to you, though it can defi-nitely communicate. I use the 1 percent rule: If you can just make it better by 1 percent each day, at the end of 100 days, you're significant - ly better. If they just learn a little bit each day, after three months of preparation, we'll have something to present to the camera. That's how I learn as well. Little increments.

Slowly, we started down the stairs. I was walking back - ward and talking to her the whole time. After I got her to the door, I went back for the gentleman and told him, \"Come on. We got to go.\" Finally he agreed to leave the building. As we headed out the exit, the first firefighter came in with a hose, and I knew my job was done. Jemimah and I got back into the car and headed toward the airport. And, thankfully, she made her flight. Uber gave me an award for what happened that day, but this shouldn't be a big deal. I believe we are all spirit. If we're all spirit, then we're all family. So I was in there helping family. \u2014As told to John RosengrenUber driver Fritz Sam ran into a burning building\u2014and saved two lives AFTER SEVEN YEARS of driving an Uber, I thought I'd seen a lot, but this was new. It was last August, and I had picked up a young lady named Jemimah to take her to LaGuardia Airport. Driving through Brooklyn, I saw a brownstone with fire shooting out of a window. I turned to Jemimah and asked, \"Can we stop and help?\" She said, \"Absolutely.\" When I pulled over, I was telling myself, Y ou are not running in there. Y ou're a father of two wonderful girls. They need their dad around. Then I heard someone say, \"There's still someone inside,\" and instinct took over. I sprinted right in. I was terrified. I knew that even a small fire can quickly grow out of control. I had a quick conversation with God. I was, like, If it's not my time to go, would you mind looking out for me? I ran into a gentleman, maybe mid- 30s. I grabbed him and said, \"We got to go.\" But he said, \"No.\" So I let him go and continued up the staircase. On the second floor, a woman in her 50s was standing in front of an open door with heavy smoke pouring through it, looking kind of stunned. She told me that her air conditioner had caught on fire. But she was not going to budge. \"You see that smoke?\" I asked her. \"That smoke'll take you out.\" She just stood there. I told her that the fire wasn't her fault. \"Things happen,\" I said. And then I said the thing that finally made her move. I told her, \"If you're not leaving, I'm not leaving.\" On a routine ride to the airport, Sam spotted flames rising from a second-story window. Driver Fritz Sam, 55, lives in New Y ork City with his wife and two daughters. 076_ATM-APR_MAY-2023-TM6 Real their future without leaving your home. $25 ,000 .00 Whole Life Insurance from United of Omaha Life Insurance Company and Companion Life Insurance Company D603084NO MEDICAL EXAM | NO HEALTH QUESTIONS | NO RATE INCREASES This is a solicitation of individual insurance.

And our Digital Skills Ready@50+ initia-tive teaches older adults the founda-tional digital skills crucial to success in today's workplace. AARP is also the leading nation- al advocate for Social Security and Medicare, defending the programs that keep many older Americans from slipping into poverty. By 2030, the number of Americans 50 and over is projected to surpass 132 million, and if current trends continue, more than 42 million will be living in poverty. As AARP Foundation's new president, I'm committed to finding innovative solutions that meet the needs of this growing population today so that we can give not only older adults but their families, their communities and generations to come the tomorrow they richly deserve. \u2014Claire Casey became AARP Foundation president in January. POVERTY among older Americans is the highest it has been in two decades. Roughly 38 million adults over 50 are living in or on the edge of pov - erty. High inflation has sapped purchasing power, making life more precarious for those already struggling to choose between paying for medicine, food, utilities and housing, or going without. AARP has been dedicated to building economic security for older adults since our found-ing more than 60 years ago. As AARP's charitable affiliate, AARP Foundation is proud to continue that legacy by helping older adults achieve financial secu-rity\u2014reducing their food and health care costs, helping them get good jobs, assisting them with obtaining the benefits they've earned, and protecting their rights in the courts. Here's a look at some of what we do. With food prices up more than 10 percent in a little more than a year, lower-income older adults can access the Foundation's help in enrolling in SNAP (formerly food stamps) to reduce their grocery bills. AARP Foundation also helps eligible seniors enroll in Medicare Savings Programs, which provided much-needed support as inflation pushed up spending on prescription drugs by almost 8 percent in 2021. We help ensure that older adults with low to moderate income receive the tax benefits they've earned. Last year, AARP Foundation Tax-Aide, our free nationwide tax assistance and preparation program, found almost $375 million in tax refunds and tax credits.AARP TAKES ON POVERTY HOW WE'RE FIGHTING FOR YOU 080-081_ATM-APR_MAY-2023-TM6 in every 3 older adults struggle to meet their basic needs.

A poet and artist, Randy \"had a hard time with the world at large and just in life,\" she says. \"He was so delicate in some ways, so sensitive. He was a real artist at heart.\" After Randy's death, Keaton shared some of his collages with her follow - ers in an Instagram video. \"I love this one,\" she says of a bold, abstract work in tones of red, cream and blue. \"What is it about? I'll never know. I'll never understand.\" Keaton has a small team that helps her put together her Instagram videos and posts. \"I need the help, and I cher - ish it,\" she says. \"It's like making little movies, in a way. It's collaborative.\" Not too long ago, she posted a vid- eo that one of her helpers had shot of Keaton doing a goofy dance outdoors to the Miley Cyrus song \"Flowers.\" \"Your incredible song gave me a rea-son to dance in my own backyard!\" Keaton wrote, tagging Cyrus. The post received nearly 1 million likes, including from admirers Lindsay Lohan, Ellen Pompeo, Alicia Keys, Kerry Washington and Roma Downey. \"It was just one of those days when I thought, I'm going to do something stupid,\" she says of the viral post. \"The music was on, I was outdoors and thought, What the heck. It happened out of nothing.\" Maybe that's the answer to my ear - lier question: What is Diane Keaton's eccentric appeal, the reason she has stayed for so many years on Amer - icans' screens and in their hearts? It could just be that she lives life on her own idiosyncratic terms\u2014and encourages the rest of us to try it too. n DIANE KEATON CONTINUED FROM PAGE 45 New Y ork-based Natasha Stoynoff 's 14th book collaboration, BONES: A Memoir (with health advocate Robyn Shumer), will be published later this year.
