Heart disease, autoimmune disease, diabetes, neurological conditions, cancer, Lyme diseasethe list goes on. The conventional, allopathic, treat-the-symptom-with-pharmaceutical-drugs model is rapidly falling out of favor as patients are searching for nontoxic, advanced prevention and healing modalities that actually work. Bioregulatory medicine involves fixing this issue with a model that has proven effective for decades in forward-thinking developed countries, including Switzerland and Germany. Our bodies have many bioregulating systems, including the cardiovascular, digestive, neurological, respiratory, endocrine, and so on. Bioregulatory medicine is a comprehensive and holistic approach to health that advocates the use of natural healing methods to support and restore the body's intrinsic self-regulating and self-healing mechanisms, as opposed to simply treating symptoms with integrative therapies. Bioregulatory medicine is about discovering the root cause of disease and takes into account the entire person from a genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, energetic, and emotional point of view. So while patients may have the same disease or prognosis, the manifestation of illness is entirely bio-individual and must be treated and prevented on an individual level. The four pillars of healthdrainage and detox, diet, mind-body medicine, and oral health are addressed by bioregulatory medicine using a sophisticated synthesis of the very best natural medicine with modern advances in technology. In addition to identifying the cause of disease, bioregulatory medicine promotes disease prevention and early intervention of illness through noninvasive diagnostics and treatments and incorporates the use of over 100 different non-toxic diagnostics and treatments from around the world. Forward-thinking patients and integrative practitioners will find bioregulatory medicine invaluable as they seek to deepen their understanding of the body's many regulating systems and innate ability to heal itself. My guest on today's podcast, Dr. Dickson Thom, is the author of the new book [Bioregulatory Medicine: An Innovative Holistic Approach to Self-Healing.](https://amzn.to/2Vgx5Zr) He graduated from the University of Toronto, Faculty of Dentistry in 1974. He obtained his first Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine degree from the Ontario College of Naturopathic Medicine in 1986, and in 1989 he completed a second Naturopathic degree from the National College of Natural Medicine (NCNM) in Portland, Oregon. Dr. Thom was a full-time professor and the past Dean of Naturopathic Medicine at NCNM where he taught clinical and physical diagnosis, gastroenterology, neurology, practical endocrinology, x-ray practicum and business entrepreneurship for almost 25 years. In addition, he was a clinic supervisor to hundreds of students and managed care for thousands of patients. Dr. Thom is now the medical director at the American Center for Biological Medicine and the American Center for Alternative Medicine in Scottsdale, AZ. These clinics are state of the art and uniquely manage care for patients from around the world. For a complete description of these unique offerings, visit the web site [TheBiomedCenter.com](http://TheBiomedCenter.com). Dr. Thom lectures extensively on health and business topics and has written and collaborated in the writing of many articles and books dealing with drainage, nutrition, and business. Dr. Thom studied extensively with G\u00e9rard Gu\u00e9niot, MD and incorporates Dr. Gu\u00e9niot's work into his seminar lectures and his private practice in Scottsdale, AZ. In August 2009 he received [The VIS Award](https://www.naturopathic.org/awards#thevis) from the American Association of Naturopathic Physicians in recognition of one who represents the Vis, the Healing Power of Nature, as demonstrated through their work, life, and community service.
