It will take time to achieve sufficient immunity to suppress virus spread, which means about 70% to 85% of the population is fully vaccinated. That's why it is important to inform your employees and ensure your organization is adhering to health and safety measures even after vaccination: Effective masking Social distancing Working remote (if possible) Handwashing Screenings COVID-19 testing strategies Cleaning, disinfecting and ventilation Unless fully vaccinated employees are symptomatic, they do not need to self-isolate or participate in contact tracing efforts after exposure to the COVID-19 virus. Keep up-to-date on your state's vaccination distribution plan Be informed about your state's phased vaccine distribution plan, which is built on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations. Phases are based on age, job type and health risk. Care systems are also reaching out to existing patients to schedule them for vaccine appointments by phase. Plans are rapidly evolving based on vaccine availability so it's important to monitor for changes regularly. Review your state's plan to determine: When your employees are eligible for vaccination some employees may be eligible sooner depending on their age, health risks and essential worker status How to adjust your workplace plans to meet vaccination distribution timelines Where your employees can access the vaccine Public health vaccination centers, healthcare systems and retail pharmacies may be a few of the available options21-1093724-1093801 (3/21) \u00a9 2021 HealthPartners 3 Create a vaccination policy Establish a committee or task force, including leadership, your HR team, legal counsel and other employees to create a vaccination policy that is in alignment with your organization's culture and values.

Important vaccine policy considerations: Understanding the pros and cons of mandating vaccines in your organization based on: How high-risk your workplace is in terms of close contact Whether your workers are considered essential, which may require vaccination in some states If your workforce is likely to comply voluntarily How to confirm proof of vaccination while protecting employee privacy and data How to manage employee requests for exemptions from vaccination for disabilities under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and sincerely held religious beliefs under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act Review of the CDC's guidance on vaccine mandates and exemptions Determining reasonable accommodations you can offer employees who request a vaccination exemption such as remote work, isolated work or masked work with social distancing Offering paid leave or vacation time for employees seeking vaccination Communicating your vaccine policy, status and instructions Know that COVID-19 vaccinations are available at no cost to individuals21-1093724-1093801 (3/21) \u00a9 2021 HealthPartners 4 Establish a vaccine education and communication plan Be a trusted source of COVID-19 vaccination information , helping reduce hesitancy, concerns and the spread of misinformation.
