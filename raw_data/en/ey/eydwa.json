However, our region's rates of pove rty and social inequality present a significant hindrance to realizing our full economic potential. Residents within inner city neighborhoods, rural communities, and, increasingly, inner ring suburbs are struggling to access jobs and build wealth. The dyna mics of increased poverty are unsustainable and pose serious long- term threats to our economy as a whole. Whether it is increased demand for social services (Onondaga County has the highest WIC redemptions per capita in NYS), poor health outcomes (Oswego C ounty has the poorest health outcomes in New York State), spikes in crime, or continued property deterioration and blight in neighborhoods (with commercial districts across the region facing 20%+ vacancy rates), the costs of poverty are too high and cannot be sustained. These factors, combined with high levels of racial segregation, also undermine CNY's attractiveness to educated workers and stymies employers who need talent in order to grow (as evidenced by a 2% net loss in the region's young adult populat ion). Ultimately, poverty and income inequality are perhaps the region's most significant barriers to long - term prosperity. Perhaps more importantly, Central New York has many underutilized human and physical capital assets, which ultimately can contribute to overall regional growth. As we design economic development strategies for the coming decades, we must be deliberate translating economic growth into economic opportunity, increased wealth, and improved quality of life within our distressed communit ies. By improving educational outcomes, aligning latent talent with industry needs, converting social service recipients into wage earners, and fostering investment within distressed communities, CNY will achieve a broader and more sustainable vision for regional prosperity. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 3 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Access to Economic Opportunity | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1Key Stats Central New York Poverty Rate, 2013 16% Upstate Poverty Rate, 2013 14% USpoverty Rate, 2013 15.8% Poverty Rate inSyracuse County, 2013 34.6% Central New York Unemployment, 2014 6.3% Upstate Unemployment, 2014 6.0% USUnemployment, 2014 6.2% PerCapita USIncome, 2013 $28,184 School Diploma orlessinCNY, 2014 210,588 High School Diploma orlessinCNY, 2014 17.9% Non English speaking households inCNY, 201448,464 Key Challenges and Opportunities To understand the dynamics of economic opportunity in Central New York, one must look beneath the surface. In the aggregate, our region performs just above the national average within several key indicators. The aggregated poverty rate for 5 counties is 14.66%, compared to a 15.8% national rate of poverty (2013 ACS), and our aggregated median income is $52,524, compared to $51,939 for the U.S. as a whole (2013 ACS). However, a cl oser look into the economic conditions of the region reveals that these conditions are not evenly distributed. There are large swaths of our region with deplorable economic and social conditions, particularly compared to neighboring areas. These key findings offer insight into the fact that strategies related to economic opportunity must be targeted to the areas that need them most: The poverty rate in Syracuse is 34.6%, compared to 14.8% in Onondaga County, and 14.66% for the region. Oswego County, meanwhile, has a 17.4% poverty rate, with the Town of Fulton coming in at 19.3%. Furthermore, Cayuga County has a poverty rate of 12.8%, while the City of Auburn experience a poverty level of 20% (2013 ACS). Median income for Syracuse residents is $31,459, compared to $54,242 in Onondaga County and $52,524 across five counties. Oswego County, meanwhile, as a median income of $48,051, CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 4 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Access to Economic Opportunity A.1and Fulton is $35,882. Furthermore, the median household income in Cayuga Cou nty is $50,544, while households in the City of Auburn have a median income of just $36,690 (2013 ACS). The regional unemployment rate across five counties is 5.4% (better than the national rate at 5.5%). The City of Syracuse, meanwhile, is at 6.9%, compared to 4.9% in Onondaga County. Oswego County unemployment rates are currently at 7.1%, while Cayuga County and the City of Auburn currently have unemployment rates of 5.3% and 6.2% respectively (April 2015 BLS, preliminary). Home ownership rates, a key i ndicator of wealth and financial capacity, also show tremendous disparities. The rate of home ownership in the City of Syracuse is 39.4%, compared to 66% in Onondaga County and 68% across Central New York. Cayuga County has a home ownership rate above the regional level at nearly 72%, but the City of Auburn has home ownership of 46% (2013 ACS). College attainment is increasingly linked with economic opportunity. The Central New York average is exactly aligned with the U.S. National average at 28%. However, there are counties in Central New York with significantly lower rates, with Cayuga County at 20% and Oswego County at 17%. Meanwhile, the City of Syracuse is lower than the national average at 26%, and significantly lower than the rest of Onondaga County, which has a 33% aggregated average (2013 ACS). Rates of business ownership also provide insight into equity in opportunity. In Onondaga County, where nearly a quarter of the total population is comprised of ethnic minorities (2010 Census), only 10% firms in Onondaga County, are minority - owned. The greatest contrast exists among African Americans, who comprise an estimated 11.5% of the total county population but only represent 4.5% of the county's business ownership. Strategies, Tactics and Objectives Objective #1 - Increase economic opportunity for un -and- underemployed Central New York residents, particularly those living in distressed communities and who face significant barriers to success. This will be measured by reductions in rates of poverty and unemployment in target areas and across the region. Strategy #1 - Encourage and incentivize strategic investments that create quality jobs within or near low -income and distressed communities. Strategy # 2 -- Foster alignment between target industries a nd un -and - underemployed residents by developing workforce solutions that create access to career pathways for individuals while providing employers with a quality workforce . CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 5 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Access to Economic Opportunity | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1Strategy # 3 - Create access to employment hubs and anchor employers for low- income workers via transit solutions and strategic housing development. Tactics: Create expansion and/or location incentives for companies in target CNY industry clusters (as identified by the regional council) within or proximate to geographies with high rates of poverty and unemployment. Develop sector -based workforce partnerships within high growth industries, aligning the needs of businesses with the services of training and education partners and community - based organizations - creating workforce prog rams that meet industry demands and provide career pathways for low -income individuals. Provide these partnerships with pools of flexible capital, which can be used to catalyze innovation and fill gaps in the system. Align public and private sector partners to systemically address challenges related to geographic access to employment, developing affordable housing options near employment hubs, and creating more flexible and responsive transit options, linking individua ls to worksites. Align public and private sector partners to systemically mitigate barriers to employment, including increasing availability and quality of social services, mental health services, support services for individuals with criminal records, and access to high quality, affordable childcare. Objective #2 - Increase wealth and economic capacity, as measured by median income and home ownership rates, within distressed parts of the region, translating economic opportunity into economic stability and growth at the grassroots level. Strategy # 4 - Encourage and incentivize locally -owned businesses within distressed neighborhoods and among under represented populations (e.g. minority populations, women, veterans, etc.). Strategy # 5 - Anchor wealth in communities by encouraging upwardly mobile residents to purchase homes there and to make other local investments as they grow their personal assets. Tactics: Build upon successful innovation, entrepreneurship, and business development initiatives acros s the region that target underrepresented populations, gleaning from national best practice models. Expand pools of flexible capital and financing that can made available to underserved populations for the purposes of business development, home ownership, and other wealth generating activities. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 6 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Access to Economic Opportunity A.1 Expand the capacity of community development financial institutions and other financial service providers to help traditionally underserved communities mitigate barriers to financial wellbeing and build assets. Incentivize cooperative and worker owned business models. Expand programs aimed at increasing household net worth (savings plans). Objective #3 - Improve quality of place in distressed neighborhoods, making them more attractive, vibrant and economically healthy communities. By stabilizing these places, we can better address root causes of segregation as well as social and economic isolation. Strategy # 6 - Empower critical organizations (land banks, CDC's, public entities) to develop real estate and infr astructure within distressed neighborhoods, improving quality of life. Strategy # 7 - Incentivize home ownership in targeted areas within the City of Syracuse and other distressed communities in the region, encouraging upwardly mobile residents to become drivers of change within their own neighborhoods. Strategy # 8 - Support and develop community parks and public art projects aimed at increasing the overall aesthetics of public and shared spaces within distressed neighborhoods. Strategy # 9 - Collaborate with educational institutions to improve urban education and educational attainment to make living in Syracuse increasing attractive Strategy # 10 - Increase community awareness, ownership and pride in Syracuse as a place to live through targeted marketing and campaign projects. Tactics : Retain talent from distressed neighborhoods through incentivized program Launch public marketing campaign aimed at increasing attractiveness of living in neighborhoods and communities being revitalized. Explore opportunit ies for improving education in both urban areas as well as low performing rural school districts Support programs and initiatives with proven success in increasing educational attainment CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 7 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Access to Economic Opportunity | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1 Upstate Revitalization Initiative Strategic Proposal: Agribusiness Background Agriculture has been a cornerstone of the Central NY economy for more than two hundred years maintaining the vitality of our region's rural communities, providing food for our urban cores, and offering tourism opportunities for visitors. There are over 3,500 farms and more than 200 food processing companies in Central NY employing nearly 4,000 people. There are additional indirect economic impacts from those businesses that support our vibrant agriculture and food processing sector (e.g. transportation and logistics, technology, manufacturing, research, and energy related businesses). In fact, agriculture and food processing contributes more than $53 billion annually to the economy of New York State. Over the past five years the Central NY region has benefited from more than $435 million of investments in agriculture and agribusiness related projects. These investments have created a stronger agriculture sector and supported the growth of the region's export economy. The global food an d beverage industry has witnessed significant growth over the past five years and is expected to continue this growth momentum, reaching approximately US $5,776 billion in 2017 with a CAGR of 5% over the next five years. Continued investment is required to remain competitive and capture both domestic and international opportunities, as are a modern and functioning transportation system, clean water and open spaces.

Challenges in getting products to market: While this potential is driven primarily by overseas growth opportunities, especially in nations with a growing middle class, businesses in this sector find it challenging to get their products to overseas markets in a timely and cost effective manner. Though there have been recent investments in some new value added facilities, the agricultural processing infrastructure as a whole is aging and requires significant investment to keep up with expected growth and related wastestreams. Disruptive technologies within the agribusiness field (precision technology, sensors, and big data) align with regional expertise and rep resent an opportunity for innovation within the field. These technologies, combined with enhanced logistics, could establish the region as a leader in on-time responsiveness to consumers seeking specific product characteristics. While the region may not ha ve significant employment based on bluetech industries, a changing climate in other parts of the country and world will place increasing premium on the availability of land, fresh water, and proximity to major population centers - all of which exist in CNY .

CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 11 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Agribusiness | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1 Upstate Revitalization Initiative Strategic Proposal: Entrepreneurship Background Entrepreneurs drive economies. They invent new products and create solutions for the world, some fun (social apps) and some fundamental (new drug discoveries). And, as numerous data sets suggest, entrepreneurs and the small businesses they create are the primary source or all net new job creation in the United States. Central New York has a rich history for generating innovative products and successful entrepreneur -led companies. However, in recent decades, the region's ability to create, deliver to markets , and scale business models at the hands of talented entrepreneurs has waned. CNY has not kept pace in generating entrepreneurial successes with the same speed and impact as comparable cities in a global context. Fortuitously, this region has rich innova tion and entrepreneurship assets and resources which, when effectively utilized and aligned, will drive the required growth and impact: 1.defined pools of talent especially, students enrolled in higher education institutions, an increasing pool of successful mid-career executives and technologists who seek new ways to deploy their skills without leaving the region, and those with ages 55+ who would consider encore careers as entrepreneurs, 2.a density of higher education institutions that create fundamental and applied research opportunities, plus t he rich fabric of creative people employed within these institutions -- entrepreneurs who could become entrepreneurs, advisors, founders and other value -added contributors to the innovation ecosystem -- and, 3.a collaborative entrepreneurship and innovation ecosystem of organizations and professionals already dedicated to making significant commitments and investments to ensure success of the ecosystem. The URI process will suggest specific interventions, with targe ted and privately -leveraged in-vestments. The result will be driving our entrepreneurial ecosystem from good to great. This is not an exercise in building vehicles and programs from scratch, as we have many world -class support structures in place. Rather, the investments will support program scale -up to drive more impact more frequently, drive evolution of programs to reach more entrepreneurs and newer markets, expand capacity of the ecosystem so that it is less focused on finding support to survive and can rather focus more wholly on entrepreneurs success, and creating bridge programs to identify gaps and ensure a broad inclusion and CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 12 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Entrepreneurship A.1participation. The results will be broad economic prosperity in the region via more successful entrepreneurial firms. Data that supports investing in Innovation and Entrepreneurship assets: Talent: 125,000 students (certificate to post doctorate) enrolled in higher education institutions within 50 miles of downtown Syracuse. UBRI Slides 13 and 14, that show a broad availability of more latter stage career professionals.

Syracuse is one of only 48 cities nationwide to receive this annually competitive program. And the cool thing is we are one of the smallest MSAs. CNY has competitively won this designation for 5 years consecutively; the reason cited by Federal sources is because Syracuse has such a robust entrepreneurial ecosystem. Key Challenges and Opportunities The CNY Entrepreneurial Ecosystem lacks sufficient early- stage seed capital to fuel growth and retain entrepreneurs . If a region's economy is like one large company, startups, entrepreneurs and researchers are like the R&D department. Without R&D spending and a commitment of resources on exploratory new product development for new markets, the region becomes less innovative and far less competitive. High Net Wealth Individuals in CNY (angels) are not participating in risk-capital investments to entrepreneurs in the region at a sufficient pace to meet the demand for capital required by innovative startup companies. There is not sufficient quantity of HNWI and those that do are not Angel investing in our region.

There are major opportunities to connect the region's world -class marke ting and market research firms, higher education assets and the economic activity of major retail venues to drive deep and broad retail technology innovation platforms. The region is primed to be a globally leading retail laboratory. Destiny USA, the sixth largest mall in America, is driving more retail sales and more overnight travelers coming to the region for shopping. http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/03/ destiny_usa_onondaga_county_sales_tax.html Terakeet, EMA, KS&R and others are world -class anchor marketing and market intelligence firms that understand national and international brands and could be better key assets to creating a \"retail laboratory\" environment in CNY. http://www.mower.com/work/ http://www.terakeet.com/about/clients/ http://www.ksrinc.com/industries/technology We have innovative companies working on these types of technologies but are retention risks: http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2014/07/syracuse_startup_getting_national_ attention_for_tech_aimed_at_small_business es.html The region could be doing a better job at specifically targeting and addressing the needs and opportunities presented by women- owned or women -lead ventures. By appealing to \"settlers\" the region can capture more innovation and economic activity from women -lead ventures. Attached American Express \"State of Women -Owned Businesses Report\". (isn't attached so should we URL reference instead?) Data points indicate the economic output potential and importance of having strategies to support women -lead ventures nationally and locally: Women -owned businesses: 9 million businesses with 7.8 million employees, 1.4 B in sales More than one in four angel investors are now women, an impressive 318% growth in the last 10 years.

While some data sets indicate decli nes in total numbers of employees and decreased economic activity in CNY's clean tech industry, there still are deep assets, talented entrepreneurs, significant research and development at regional higher education institutions, and s upport programs in place that have effectively launched emerging clean tech technologies into the market place. Further complicating the scenario is that Clean Tech industrial data is often aggregated with related industry fields and there are not clear NAICS codes or definitions to capture the economic activity. The region needs to become more intentional about tracking, understanding, and defining it's clean tech assets supported with data findings and economic analysis. Recent small business and startup growth patterns show that CNY is still able to lead very successful Clean Tech business and industry development projects. Further investment into this cluster is merited. There are several healthy anecdotes that indicate the Region is poised for continued innovation in the green and clean technologies.

Strategies, Tactics and Objectives Objective #1: Ensure CNY's entrepreneurship brand be represented at a major, out-of-region tech event 10 times a year. Show a year over year impression count growth of 20% for the next five years of the region's brand. Develop a content platform that is region -wide where investors, innovators, and entrepreneurs are served in both a push and pull fashion that integrates with other national and international content websites, sustaining 10% increases in marketing metrics year over year for five years. Attract an established global technology company leader to have an office or location in CNY, on average of 1 per year for five years. Strategy #1 - Market the CNY Regional Innovation and Entrepreneurship Ecosystem to attract and retain entrepreneurs and innovators in specific markets. Tactics: Using the Innovation Hot Spot Governance structure, invest in creating a comprehensive marketing plan that includes branding, value p ropositions, audience segmentation and content calendars with the associated budget to execute on the plan. The plan will focus on no more than 5 technol ogy verticals where CNY will be globally differentiated. (clean tech, ad-tech, UAS and commerce tech have already been identified as candidates) Through MOU's create cohesion and leverage of the marketing resources of current Innovation and Entrepreneurshi p organization in the ecosystem. Focus on cross -marketing, shared procurement, and creating economies of scales amongst innovation and entrepreneurship service providers. New investments and resources are needed to reach both local and global strategic audiences. Establish market/product -appropriate partnerships and alliances \u2014 importers, distributors, sales representatives. Create a region wide entrepreneur and innovator tracking system (part CRM and part IT help ticket) where region -wide metrics and perform ance can be ascertained. Metrics should include service delivery, attraction & retention of innovators, understanding the \"voice of customer\", and measure regional return on investment of innovation and entrepreneurship programming. Develop an internationa l location incubator/accelerator in China CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 16 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Entrepreneurship A.1Objective #2: Decrease vacancy on Warren Street 15% each year for five years. Attract a mix of anchor technology firms and startups in commercial spaces with the housing and amenity real-estate to contribute to the commercial success of the Innovation District that total $15 million in new investments. Create 200 housing unit options in or immediately adjacent to the Innovation district Locate 3 major academic institution led R&D projects or centers in the Innovat ion District within 3 years. Strategy #2 - Create a vibrant innovation district that attracts and retains innovators to Syracuse's urban core - and eventually supporting satellite districts in the region's smaller cities - which attracts and incentivizes new real estate development while pushes new frontiers in technology, municipal and civic infrastructure Tactics: Install via a \"cut once\" approach new, world -class, innovative data, energy & thermal, and municipal infrastructure (water, sewer) to create an innovative loop focused on servicing all commercial properties along Warren Street between the Tech Garden and the State Tower Building Create a series of economic development incentives and investments, such as forgivable loans for attracting Tech Gard en graduates, to drive real estate development (commercial and residential) focused on serving entrepreneurs and innovators along Warren Street. Complete a comprehensive environmental review and develop a sustainable bus iness model feasibility of developin g the Tech Garden's roof as a highly visible and catalytic project in the Innovation District. Develop with regional colleges and universities specific research and development projects, centers and facilities to be located on the Innovation District that are enhance and are supportive of the civic, commercial and data infrastructure in the district. Develop a compelling wayfinding, streetscaping, signage, fa\u00e7ade, landscaping, cultural capacity sites, and open space to differentiate the Innovation District and encourage creativity and innovation. Provide the nation's fastest and most reliable urban core, free, public wifi zone. Create a non-profit managed, fiber loop to each building floor in the Innovation District. Create a comprehensive survey of satellit e locations (outside Onondaga County) that would support opportunities and gaps not provided in the Syracuse Innovation District to serve new innovators and entrepreneurs in surrounding counties. Develop district microgrid to share heat and energy between the buildings located on the Innovation district to increase resiliency and responsiveness of the built environment. Allow for new technology research and development and improve the environmental sustainability of the Innovation District, operable by 2017.

CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 18 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Entrepreneurship A.1 Upstate Revitalization Initiative Strategic Proposal: Financial Services Background Financial Services is already a strong driver of regional employment in Central New York. Although this sector has declined 2.4% since the recession of 2008, it still represents approximately 1,032 establishments and 13,331 workers. There are approximately 10,000 additional workers in this same sector in the Mohawk Valley region directly adjacent to Central New York (CNY). Often the same employer will have a significant number of employees in both the CNY and Mohawk Valley Regions. The underlying reasons companies selected this region to locate financial services operations remain in place even as the industry has undergone change. Central New York has had success in attracting jobs in financial services sector operations due to its relatively low real estate costs; ideal geographic location near major financial centers such as New York City, Boston, Philadelphia and Hartford; availability of low-cost, high speed telecommunications bandwidth and networks; co -location with defense and aerospace cybersecurity centers of excellence in the Mohawk Valley region; relatively secure geographic location; skilled workforce and competitive wages. The regional wages of $59,809 in this industry are approximately 30% below the pay rate in large metropolitan areas yet are significantly above the average regional wages of $39,660. This region is also home to several leading academic institutions, institutions with a long history of partnering with the business community to provide the workforce they need to succeed in today's rapidly changing environment. For example, unique to this area, SUNY Oswego and Utica College both offer a B.S. in Risk Management and Insurance. These degree programs produce numerous well - respected, skilled graduates each year which attract and serve the needs of area employers. Syracuse University and Le Moyne College are both partners in the IBM and SAP Academic Alliances, both of which provides secure supercomputing resources, data and software that are critical to financial services research and industry partner programs. Le Moyne College has developed an Enterprise Systems certificate program and curricula with 5 financial services firms in the Central New York region that provides large -scale database, security and program management education and experience to students who then leverage that education and experience in the financial services firms' internship and full- time hiring programs. These strong, long -standing industry -academic relationships are key to a future where all are being asked to do more with less. With a heavy reliance on strong business school graduates from programs such as these and ever growing information technology needs, including cyber security, this industry is well positioned to benefit from the graduates the region' s strong academic institutions cultivate. In addition, area colleges and universities are often uniquely positioned to be able to leverage a public - private partner relationship with industry in order to obtain matching grant funding for collaborative projects. These joint grant applications can bring significant dollars to the region that will then fuel innovation and economic growth. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 19 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Financial Services | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1 Many of the best known and largest businesses in financial services have located operations in Central New York. We are w ell positioned to not only keep these jobs here in Central New York but also to unite as a regional financial services industry and use our proven strength to seek and leverage financing and equity for other partner industries. The right strategic investments will ensure that we are well positioned to support the decision that many companies in this industry made years ago - Central New York is the best place to locate financial services operations and to grow industry. Central New York provides a low cost o f living and labor operations and our region's financial services sector can provide valuable advice and expertise since we understand the unique needs of our partners; we are committed to seeing them thrive in our community because, in return, we all thri ve.

In the next 3 -5 years many of them may disapp ear Battelle data shows a loss of 3.6% of the region's financial services establishments from 2009- 2013. At the same time the number of establishments nationally declined by only 1.2% During the same timeframe regional employment in this sector decreased b y 6.8% while growing 1.1% nationally People looking for job opportunities don't understand the true nature and diversity of job opportunities in this sector. Syracuse City schools is working to integrate a customer service tract into career considerations and already at least one of the member organizations is participating in this Some college graduates are taking entry level positions to get in the door at some of the financial services companies. Two of the participants stated they have major operations both here and in the Mohawk Valley Region Filling jobs in this sector in this region may become more difficult in the future as current college graduates may not have the right skills and/or may not see the opportunity here while the existing workforce, a relative wage bargain and very productive, may need additional skills for the technical jobs of the future. Today's students are being trained for today's jobs but this is problematic even in the near term because the skill sets may not be applicable in the future. Complex jobs will be available in fields like data analytics, cyber security and data forensics but will require data sciences and analytics knowledge that is not being commonly emphasized currently Graduates who may have the right skills are frequently not staying in Central New York even if they went to school here. New York City, Boston or other recognized financial centers are more attractive because of the earning potential and glamour of working in a big city for a big name firm One compa ny took a survey of existing employees and discovered they had 20 different languages covered. This was a surprising finding. Do workers have more skills than we realize? Per Battelle the value added per worker in the financial services sector in the CNY region is $119,903 which is roughly 10% more than the national average for this sector. Due to changes in technology people with the right skill set can live anywhere in the world so while being the #1 location in the US 1 is good, it may not be sufficient to attract new major operations or even keep the ones we have Employers no longer assume an employee is leaving the company when they move. The employer will make accommodations to allow the worker to be productive wherever they choose to live. Already some \"CNY workers\" don't live here, they simply report up through a group housed here 1 Syracuse was ranked the number one location for service centers in the Hackett stu dy. The Hackett study looked at labor and office space availability and cost, the quality of the workforce, local laws, infrastructure, transportation, and other factors to arrive at its list of the best areas to set up a services center. In Hackett's national ranking, Syracuse was first, followed by Jacksonville and Tampa, Fla., and Lansing and Grand Rapids, Mich. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 21 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Financial Services | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1CNY has been identified as the #1 location for service center type operations in the US but we are 38th in the world. Virtually all the major companies in this sector now hou se operations in Central and Latin America due to cost, time zone and language considerations Real estate pricing is competitive but availability is a concern. Is real estate an opportunity or a challenge? Battelle data shows an average wage of $59,809 in this sector and region but a national average wage of $80,903. We are a bargain for labor. There is a very strong need for customer facing humans even in the highly automated future of financial services The cell phone is the new branch office and people a nd companies are expected to know how to use this The automation, while improving productivity is also creating additional demand for customer support One member had doubled the number of support people locally while another stated that they have also made a significant increase in the number of staff Financial services can be looked at as both a \"retail\" and wholesale\" operation. Even with all the advances in technology the human element is very important on the retail side and for support on the wholesale side. Jobs that had been offshored have been returned to the US due to customer service and quality issues As mentioned above we are ranked number 1 in the US for customer service locations Security and risk management, top concerns for firms in this sect or, are evolving rapidly and are becoming more critical as operations become more automated and locations more diverse Jobs that companies had outsourced have now been brought back into companies due to risk and security considerations. Companies are mitig ating risk in two ways. One is by putting strong systems in place to protect resources and another is by insuring against the damages that would occur should someone break through the systems. One of New York State's executives announced that he is leaving to start his own consulting firm that will operate in the area of risk management. Technology risk does not exist independently and usually just sits under operations. New York state needs to be better positioned to retain jobs and aggressively attract jo bs from outside the state. Other states, Florida and Texas were mentioned, are actively poaching jobs located in New York. Often these other states will offer significant incentives to relocate. Taxes remain a concern for companies operating in New York as well as for the people they employ. This is especially true for those at the top end of the earning spectrum in this industry. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 22 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Financial Services A.1Strategies, Tactics and Objectives Objectives: Keep CNY high school students interested in STEM courses by illustrating the job opportunities available in this region. Retain an additional 50+ graduates/year in business and computer related fields in the CNY region by providing more internships and co operative education placements to them with the region's businesses while the graduates are still college students in our region. Align our graduates with the needs of the private sector and use the education process to demonstrate the quality lifestyle ( affordable real estate, high quality education and healthcare, exceptional recreaion opportunities - natural and man -made, culture/tourism) that is available in CNY. Make job opportunities available and known to underserved segments of the population who may not have previously considered a career in this field. This includes those who do not have college degrees. Create and retain an additional 50 highly educated and skilled professionals in this sector. Attract and retain an additional 200 jobs plus $3 million in investment per year. Retain an additional 50 college graduates in CNY and help companies attract an additional 25 employees from outside the region. In Summary Create new jobs = attract and retain approximately 300 jobs per year Attract or gener ate new net wealth for the region= attract new investment in excess of $3 million per year in financial services while also positively impacting sectors such as information security and health care Positively impact other indicators of economic prosperity= provide a range of opportunities which will enable those with and those without college degrees to pursue opportunities in the financial services sector. In addition promoting the lifestyle assets of the region will enhance other areas such as tourism, ar ts and culture Strategy #1 \u2014Promote job openings within the financial services sector Tactics: Create a unified online job hub (portal) so that all jobs in this sector can be located in one easy to find site. This site will be advertised on all campuses as well as on radio and television. This online portal should be created because we need to create a comprehensive inventory of companies and universities engaged in this sector Hire an industry advocate(s) whose sole focus is to serve as a connection between this industry and the stakeholders such as the public, universities and supply chain companies. Use the industry advocate(s) to connect non- financial businesses in the area to a wide range of services so that they in turn may have access to financ ial services and grow locally. The resources would consist of Banks and/or credit unions Accounting services Insurance services Legal services Investment or real estate services CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 23 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Financial Services | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1Strategy #2 - Retain highly talented graduates with financial services relat ed degrees Tactics: Increase the number of intern and cooperative education opportunities available and create a central repository for this information so it is easy for employers, students and/or job seekers to locate. We will align our efforts with the information security sector. Sponsor an industry collaboration day where organizations in this sector meet with regional colleges and universities to discuss the trends being seen in the industry and the industries' employment needs and opportunities. Connect the industry to additional job candidates through efforts such as On point for Jobs and the region's colleges' Career Services offices. Create very targeted programs to funnel qualified people into jobs rather than lose them to opportunities in other regions. Create a welcome packet to help companies recruit employees from outside CNY. Strategy #3 - Enhance alignment of employer needs and skills taught in the region's education institutions Tactics: Sponsor an industry collaboration day where organizations in this sector meet with regional colleges and universities to discuss the trends being seen in the industry and the industries' employment needs and opportunities. Strategy #4 - Become the onshore alternate for companies looking to offshore financial services jobs Tactics: Create the equivalent of a Startup NY for existing financial service companies. Create a launch pad which allows companies to locate here easily and painlessly as we will have addressed some of the real estate, infrastruct ure, hiring and staffing issues up front. Note this launch pad can either take the shape of a program where we put services in place to address challenges or we can actually develop an office space and have it ready (developed on Spec) for financial services to occupy it. This means we would own, operate and staff the facility for administrative functions. A good way to think about this is that it operates like a business incubator with two exceptions; 1) It is only for financial services companies and 2) it is not just for start ups. Proactively target \"supply chain\" companies in other states. Create illustrations of life costs using the average industry wage and typical costs in the larger markets. This will illustrate that a large paycheck is not the only metric that matters. Market the affordability of operations in Upstate New York to existing financial centers so that CNY can be considered as a viable outsourcing alternative. Create an I Love Central New York campaign styled on the I Love NY campaign that talks about all of our natural assets and excellent lifestyle. We will align our lifestyle promotion efforts with tourism efforts. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 24 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Financial Services A.1 Upstate Revitalization Initiative Strategic Proposal: Health and Environment Rationale The Health and Environment sector synergistically combines some of the most innovative industry clusters of the region, presents high employment and wage concentration, and a competitive advantage in growth and export potential to attract research, investment, and employment opportu nities. All told, close to 400 establishments employ close to 30,000 people and generate $5.8 billion in economic activity in the region. Further investment in this sector would propel the region into global markets that are expected to grow by $400 billion, lead to significant savings in healthcare expenditures over the next five years, while benefitting the health and well-being of our citizens through precision, Data- to- Knowledge health and environmental advances. Background Employment in HEALTH and ENVIRONMENT sectors is highly concentrated in Central New York. Our region's hospitals directly employ close to 20,000 people, and another 4,726 are employed in private, high tech biomedical companies with average wages approaching $70,000, nearly double t he region's median wage. There are close to 1,500 physicians in Onondaga County alone. Throughout Central New York, 427 private physician practices were responsible for $1 billion in wages for 5,947 physicians and staff members. The health and biomedical clusters generate $4.5 billion in economic activity in the region. In 2015, Battelle reported that the five-county region has 4,726 jobs in the biomedical cluster, and a very high location quotient of 1.56. Battelle also noted that biosciences are the number one R&D cluster for the region's academic institutions. (Source CNYREDC, Five Year Strategic Plan 2012 -2016, several of the statistics are from Battelle, 2013 and 2015). Our universities are well-positioned to create a pipeline for a world- class e ducation and training programs for the next generation of informaticians and healthcare providers who speak the language of precision and personalized healthcare, predictive modeling of disease outbreaks and biomimicry. Central New York has the eighth highest concentration of private sector \"green jobs\" of any region in the country The Clean Energy and Environmental Systems (CEES) cluster is a cornerstone of the region's economy, with a location quotient of 1.48, that includes more than 3,633 jobs represent ing 3% of all CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 25 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Health & Environment | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1jobs. The average wage for clean sector jobs in Central New York is more than $55,000 \u20148% higher than the average for other sectors in the region. The region outpaces the nation in terms of its share of clean economy jobs that offer good pay for modest education. CEES includes multiple technologies and innovations that operate together as integrated systems, including supply chains of raw materials from local sources. The five county CNY region has been home to innovators and entrepreneurs who have developed pioneering advances in several key CEES markets including HVAC, water resources, indoor and outdoor air quality, energy production from renewable resources and sustainable materials management. There is significant growth in regional, national, and global demand for the products and services generated in the HEALTH and ENVIRONMENT sectors. The region's hospitals generate $2.5 billion in economic activity. According to Battelle (2015) the health sector, which includes hospitals and health services, has been a strong and steady national growth sector in recent years, adding such jobs as scientists, medical/clinical lab techs, and science techs through the recession. CNY has seen similar gains as its cluster grew by 12.8% between 2001 and 2013. Meanwhile CNY's biomedical cluster since 2009 has enjoyed an accelerated growth rate of 7.8% while the nation grew at only 2.1%. The hospitals and health services sector enjoys an 11% higher level of concentration in the region when compared natio nally which demonstrates its ability to serve patients outside of Central New York, bringing new wealth into the region. In addition health is one of the clusters that experienced double digit growth in real wages over this time period, with a 20% increas e in the region, much higher than the national average. The demand in growth for health services is driven by an aging population, advances in medical technologies, increased life expectancy, and patient empowerment. Due to increased life expectancy, like the nation and state, the CNY population is aging, making it more prone to chronic diseases, which will require complex, ongoing, costly health care services. In 2011, those age 65 and older comprised less than 15 percent of the US population but accounted for more than one -third of national health care expenditures. Although the regional population is expected to be stable, the elderly in CNY will expand to comprise 33% of the population by 2030. Those age 85 and older are expected to increase by 27%. The elderly will comprise 21% of the population in 2030, compared to 14% in 2000, slightly more than the national estimate of 20%. The number of seniors in counties outside of Onondaga County could increase between 30 and 66 percent. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2010 Census projections, the population age 65 and older is expected to more than double between 2012 and 2060, from 43.1 million to 92.0 million. The elderly would represent just over one in five U.S. residents by the end of the period, up from one in seven today. Those 85 and older are projected to more than triple from 5.9 million to 18.2 million, reaching 4.3 percent of the total population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2012). By 2050, the number of people age 65 and older with Alzheimer's disease may nearly triple, from 5 million to a projected 13.8 million (2010 U.S. Census/Herbert, 2013). Similar growth patterns are predicted in the environment sector. Critical to the health of our communities and environment is the development of clean energy and the tracking of its impact through data analytics. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, investment in deployment of CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 26 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Health & Environment A.1clean energy rose 16% to $310 billion in 2014, fueled in part by emerging markets including a 32% expansion in China's com mitment to renewable energy such as wind and solar power. Investment in the U.S. rose 8% to $51.8 billion. The region has great potential to exploit the shift away from large, centralized power stations to smaller, local distributed power, where investment grew 34% to $73.5 billion. New equity for clean energy companies on the public markets also grew 52% to $18.7 billion, driven by a succession of U.S. and U.K. -listed yield cos and project funds. The region has great potential to exploit the shift awa y from large, centralized power stations to smaller, local distributed power, where investment grew 24% to $73 billion. Central New York possesses resources to support HEALTH and ENVIRONMENT clusters and, therefore, this region has a competitive advantage to attract research, investment and employment opportunities. Due to its performance in employment and wages, the UB regional assessment (2015; UBRI) selected the Biomedical and the Health & Environment clusters as the number one URI priority for the regi on. It also recommended that the region become a hub for green technology. Central New York holds a unique set of healthcare assets including a large number of acclaimed healthcare institutions, high quality academic and nursing colleges, global bioscien ce and medical technology companies, and several prestigious higher education institutions with significant research capacity. Its educational services are rated as highly competitive by UBRI. Big data is the fastest growing sector of the healthcare industry but what distinguishes this initiative, and our regional strengths, is a focus on the environmental influences to human health. Healthcare of the future will be driven by using big data collected from all aspects of a patient's life experiences, envir onment and host conditions allowing customization of treatment. This big data focus also mirrors the need to examine the impacts of environmental degradation/global warming on human health and understanding those impacts. The D2D Innovation Alliance (2013) highlights environment and energy monitoring as well as medicine as markets of choice for its cluster, which comprises 50 companies employing 9,000 workers in CNY. In addition to this current strength, there are many natural industry partners that can b e recruited to our area to support precision and environmental health issues. The IBM Watson platform was conceived to consider environmental big data and its influences on human health. GE/Omnyx has a strong interest in developing a national center in Syracuse for digital pathology. Foundation Medicine seeks to provide understandable and actionable reports to clinicians derived from large data analytics. The Gates Foundation is engaged with the Center for Global and Translational Research. And Microso ft has moved aggressively in the precision health arena. Commercial partners with expertise in designing large databases, such as Google or Lockheed -Martin, would be recruited to assist in the design and implementation of the biomimetic informatics database. Partners such as these, as well as new companies that result from intellectual property developed as a result of these institutes, will guarantee a large economic impact to CNY and a return on investment that is sure to exceed ten to one. Central New York has a well- established regional innovation cluster in CEES, that is poised to emerge as an international leader in research, development, deployment and exporting of products and services that address critical global challenges. The region is home to New York State's Center of Excellence in CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 27 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Health & Environment | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1Energy and Environmental Systems (Syracuse CoE), a consortium of more than 200 research institutions and private sector companies. To address finance issues in the region, the Clean Tech Center at the Syracuse- based Tech Garden offers technical and financial assistance \u2014by facilitating access to angel investments and venture capital\u2014 to entrepreneurs and early stage companies to foster clean technology business development Since 2000, this cluster has established col laborative enterprises to accelerate CEES innovations, recruited six companies to the region, assisted existing companies to develop new products and services, supported the launching of new companies, commercialized innovative technologies, and created un ique resources for research, development and demonstration. The region is well situated to leverage state and private investments through the NY Green Bank, NY- Sun Initiative, NY Best, NY Prize and other initiatives to generate a return on investment greater than ten to one. The HEALTH and ENVIRONMENT sectors attach to other key industry clusters in Central New York, and this alignment creates even greater economic impact. Our extensive research and development (R&D) in the biosciences and CEES clusters no t only fuels health and biomedical, but also drives our agribusiness, advanced manufacturing, food, medical tourism, and other core industries. The HEALTH and ENVIRONMENT sectors have a natural overlay to other clusters as well. The region has demonstrat ed its commitment to the development of its biosciences and CEES clusters through market access acceleration, networking, business services and incubation, links to the R&D pipeline, and corporate partnerships. State investment will attract private and fo reign investment, facilitate growth of exports, and strengthen connections to global supply chains to the benefit of these clusters and associated industries. Around the world, growth in CEES clusters is fast becoming the driving force behind the accele ration of innovations in water, waste, bio -fuels, and green materials which have potential to drive growth in the region's core industries including agribusiness and food, advanced manufacturing and precision machining, and plastics.

Separately, the CNY Health and Environment clusters each have well- established structures and mechanisms to facilitate collaborations among the region's firms and institutions, creating opportunities to accelerate new initiatives in each cluster and at the interface of the two clusters. In pursuing opportunities at the interface of the Health and Environment clusters, a key issue that will need to be addressed is the level of resources required to engage firms and institutions to pursue new opportunities that are outside of their traditional markets. When allocated to overcome the c hallenges identified by UBRI, resources would foster growth and export in this sector and the D2D Innovation Alliance, by: Better preparing the workforce through targeted educational offerings at the intersection of health sciences, environmental sciences, and STEM, such as precision medicine, biomedical informatics, enviro -informatics, neuroinformatics, and data science. Increasing R&D funding, which currently lags behind the rest of Upstate, to fuel innovation and help retain young adults in the region. Build stronger University -industry partnerships to increase innovation for existing firms. Increase venture capital to attract new firms and young adults to overcome the aging workforce trend. Investing in the CNY Health and Environment sector will advance many of the key findings, and will further many of the strategies of the CenterState CEO Agenda for Economic Opportunity, including developing \"data -to-decision\" technologies in multiple sectors, boosting the region's exports, strengthening the regional innovative ecosystem, and retaining and expanding a skilled workforce. \"Precision Health and Environment\" is the unifying opportunity that addresses emerging global needs and leverages regional strengths in the CNY Health and Environment clusters. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 29 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Health & Environment | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1Precisio n Health and Environment is a data -driven evolution and as such, all economic assets in this sector and partnering sectors, would be touched by advances in this area. This includes 19,816 hospital and health employees in 138 firms, 4,726 biomedical employ ees in 107 firms, and 3,633 employees in 144 firms for a total of 28,175 employees in 389 firms. In addition, there are 9,000 D2D employees in 50 firms as well as additional assets in our academic institutions. In the nation, healthcare services represen t 11.7% of all jobs, with a predicted growth to 13.6% by 2022. In addition, this sector's innovations would benefit the society as a whole. Precision Health and Environment innovations include advances in \"data -to-decision\" technologies and \"Big Data\" analytics to develop customized treatments or solutions for a specific individual, a building, a site, a neighborhood, a community, and/or a region. Many envisioned opportunities will analyze streams of data to support decision - making in real time. These innovations will leverage emerging sensor and communications technologies, including distributed wireless sensors, wearable technologies, and the widespread deployment of such devices as part of the \"Internet of Things.\" Precision Health and Environment includes three distinct opportunities: Precision Health refers to the emerging field of Personalized and Precision Medicine (PPM), defined as the approach of moving beyond \"one size fits all\" medicine by taking into account individual differences in people s' genes, microbiomes, environments and lifestyles. This approach includes providing preventive care, diagnosis, treatment, and follow -up regimen tailored to a detailed profile of a person. PPM has generated global policy interest in the past few years, including President Obama's $215 million investment in a Precision Medicine Initiative, due to its enormous potential to target efficient therapies for patients as well as to identify pre -symptomatic individuals at risk of developing diseases. The socio -economic benefits of PMM by reducing heart disease incidence alone could generate $607 billion in improved health over 50 years; similar figures are expected for cancer, diabetes, hypertension, lung disease, and stroke. Because of CNY's current strengths in biomedical, hospitals, and education, investing in \"data to decisions\" innovations would establish the region as a leader instead of a follower in the forth -coming shift to data -driven medicine. Precision Environments includes CNY's nationally recognized s trengths in engineering and environmental service firms, which develop customized solutions for sites ranging from individual buildings, industrial and wastewater treatment facilities, and whole communities. Leveraging CNY strengths and opportunities, SyracuseCoE was established in 2002 by New York State a statewide Center of Excellence for Environmental and Energy Systems. In 2012, CNY earned recognition from five federal agencies for an emerging regional cluster in Advanced Manufacturing for Thermal and Environmental Controls (AM -TEC). Future opportunities for innovations in Precision Environments will leverage progress made in prior efforts and strategically target emerging markets that are driven by issues including climate change, community resilience to intense storms, distributed energy resources, and opportunities to CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 30 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Health & Environment A.1develop integrated solutions across a cascade of scales from whole communities to individuals. Environmental Health is an emerging opportunity for CNY to leverage long - standing strengths in its Health and Environmental clusters to develop innovations that monitor and control environmental quality to understand and improve human health outcomes. Opportunities include the Hill Collaboration on Environmental Medicine, a partnership between SUNY ESF, UMU, SU and the Veterans Administration Hospital whose focus is to stimulate collaborative, cross -disciplinary research in the areas of cancer, diabetes and disorders of the nervous system. Other opportunities include developing innovations that will provide \"Precision Indoor Environmental Quality (PIEQ),\" tailored to meet needs and/or requirements of individuals. Health Key Findings: Precision Health companies and institutions have strong global market opportunities that with enhanced R&D funding, industry -academia partnerships, workforce training, and venture capital would multiply: CNY has special opportunities to create jobs by leveraging existing strengths in its Health and Biomedical clusters to create leading -edge advances in Precision Health analytics, technologies, services, and education. Investments in Precision Health could foster R&D innovation, currently lacking funding in CNY, build stronger University -industry partnerships with existing firms and increase venture capital to attract new firms. Analytics: Highly granular analytics allows for the precise measurement of biological and environmental data over time to the point that hundreds of gigabytes of data are becoming available to describe a person's health status. Leveraging CNY 's highly concentrated Hospital & Health Services cluster will position the region to develop data to decisions analytical approaches in diagnostics, therapies, risk assessment, and health monitoring through Big Data technologies, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics in the health and biomedical sectors. Globally, the Big Data analytics market represents $125 billion worldwide and is expected to grow at a rate of 26% per year, causing a shortage of skilled workforce. This trend is particularly crucial in healthcare where institutions are struggling to leverage their data in spite of accumulating 85 percent more data than they did two years. For example 77% of health care executives give their organizations a \"C\" or below for managing their data. Technologies: The growing CNY Biomedical cluster, with its medical device specialization and life sciences R&D strength, will propel the development of the next generation of Internet of Things biosensors, wearable, implantable, imaging, and genomic device s producing the biomedical data pipeline for analytics and smart health services. Combining and performing cross -analytics of clinical data from EHRs, images, fine - grained biological data, and lifestyle data through data fusion will stimulate the developme nt of new and powerful technologies for delivering personalized health care. Internet of Things analytics represents a hot market with a five -year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30%. Services: While the CNY Hospital sector often is viewed as being locally oriented and service -based, the fact that it enjoys an 11% higher level of concentration in the region when compared nationally, demonstrates its ability to serve patients outside of Central CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 31 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Health & Environment | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1New York. With the support of the highly concentrated Biom edical sector (56% more concentrated in CNY than in the nation) and the local academic institutions R&D specialization in biosciences, the region's capacity to provide advanced personalized and precision medicine will make our health care institutions highly competitive in the global market and bring new wealth into the region through intelligent decision support, medical tourism, and telemedicine. Investing in developing interdisciplinary fields such as biomedical informatics would provide the tech skills training our current health workforce needs to succeed in the cyber -medicine era. Intelligent augmentation of healthcare services through analytics, machine learning, and cognitive computing will follow the societal trend leading half of the population to use intelligently augmented services by 2018. The telemedicine market reached $19.2 billion in 2014 with strong growth predicted at 17.7% per year through 2019, while Upstate University Hospital already serves a 17 - county region of New York. Education: Ed ucation and training in precision health will address the region's need for high -skilled workers for the knowledge economy, the reduction and retention of residents with advanced skills and education, and the re -entry of existing un -trained workers into an education pipeline that will lead to well- paying jobs. The region already has strong academic programs in health informatics at Onondaga Community College, SUNY Oswego, Syracuse University, and SUNY Upstate Medical University to develop education pipelin es to train the diverse workforce required to meet the challenges of a data -driven economy. Among the predicted 181,000 new roles in \"deep analytics\" by 2018, and five times as many positions requiring related skills, specialized workers mastering Big Data analytics in the context of healthcare cybersecurity and work ethics will be in high demand. Because biomedical data (150 trillion GB in 2011 and growing exponentially), contains a strategic yet largely untapped wealth of information, the National Institu te of Health (NIH) has recently launched an unprecedented Big Data to Knowledge initiative that encompasses educational, research, and industry facets working synergistically. The region has not focused its local talent and capabilities to build an integrated and collaborative approach to research and development of new therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging . Like the nation, the population of Syracuse is aging and as a result the rates of age -related neurodegener ative diseases such as Alzheimer's are increasing rapidly. By 2050, the number of people age 65 and older with Alzheimer's disease may nearly triple, from 5 million to a projected 13.8 million (2010 U.S. Census/Herbert, 2013). This region has incredible st rengths in neuroscience research and instrumentation within the SUNY UMU Neuroscience Research Building (NRB) and within Syracuse University. In addition, some of the top clinicians in Alzheimer's live and practice in CNY. However, the region has not focus ed this talent and these capabilities to build an integrated and collaborative approach to research and development of new therapeutics for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. There is a huge market for precision medicine technologies and care delivery practices to address chronic disease management which with enhanced R&D funding, industry -academia partnerships, workforce training, and venture capital would multiply : The cost of managing chronic diseases comprises an extraordinary 86% of all healthcare costs. Everyone in the healthcare community is in the business of reducing the costs of managing chronic diseases, and there is a huge market for precision medicine technologies and care delivery practices to address this stron g global market. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 32 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Health & Environment A.1 Environmental and Health Findings: The emerging \"Internet of Things\" has significant potential to disrupt markets for a wide variety of environmental and energy systems. Environmental Health and Medicine: The Hill Collaboration in Environmental Medicine was leveraged to obtain SUNY 2020 funding to develop The Institute for Environmental Health and Environmental Medicine (IEHEM). The foci of IEHEM include educational pipelines in environment and health, the development of wireless remote sensor devices to capture health and environment data, and the study of the influences of climate and environment on global health and infectious disease. The IEHEM platform positions the region extremely well to address the impacts of climate change on human health and to develop new technologies to lessen these impacts. New York State has identified development of new technologies to lessen the impacts of climate change as an economic growth opportunity, and CNY is uniquely well -positioned given curr ent assets that are concentrated in the region. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), environment factors of health encompass a large number of determinants among the most influential, including but not limited to housing, waste, energy, food and agriculture, transport, industry, and urbanization. Precision Indoor Environmental Quality: A confluence of emerging technologies \u2014 including the Internet of Things, wireless controls, wearable technologies, advanced manufacturing, Big Data analytics, and more \u2014promises to revolutionize systems that provide Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) in buildings and other settings. Through long -standing strengths in HVAC innovations, CNY has a special opportunity to develop next- generation systems that will deliver benefits across a cascade of scales from whole buildings to individual occupants. Environment Findings: Reforming the Energy Vision (REV)\" has significant potential to transform markets for resilient, clean energy in New York State and across the US. Distributed Energy and Environmental Quality Systems: Supported by competitively awarded funding from five federal agencies, the emerging CNY regional cluster in Advanced Manufacturing for Thermal and Environmental Controls (AM -TEC) has successfully engaged more than 50 firms in a range of coordinated activities to accelerate innovations and jobs. The success of the AM -TEC initiative creates an opportunity to expand the approach to include professional service firms (including architecture, engineering), targ eting development of replicable turn -key engineered solutions for emerging markets, such as net zero energy buildings and community microgrids that are likely to be catalyzed by changes in New York State policies that are expect to emerge from the Reformin g the Energy Vision (REV) and the Clean Energy Fund. The worldwide microgrid market is expected to exceed $40 billion annually by 2020, with North America accounting for roughly 65 percent of global market share. The larger smart grid market is expected to surpass $400 billion globally by 2020, with an average CAGR of more than 8%. Since 2000, the number of LEED - certified buildings worldwide has seen an impressive CAGR of nearly 69%; CNY leads New York State with CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 33 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Health & Environment | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1more than four times as many LEED -rated projects per capita than any other REDC region. Occupant health and wellness are undervalued in the marketplace for building environmental and energy systems. High -Performance Building Retrofits: Improving energy efficiency in existing residential and comme rcial buildings is a critical need in CNY, throughout New York State, across the U.S., and around the world. Over the last 15 years, CNY has developed internationally recognized R&D capabilities relating to building materials and energy systems, and the re gion has a well -established subcluster in Indoor Environmental Quality. In addition, CNY is New York State's leader in the intensity of LEED -certified projects (per capita). The region has a special opportunity to leverage these assets by attracting firm s that manufacture energy -efficient building products such as innovative insulation systems for retrofits and manufacturing of high -performance heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. McGraw -Hill Construction estimates the U.S. market for major commercial renovation activity at more than $50 billion annually, comprising a growing share of total all construction projects, with major growth opportunities in renewables and net zero energy construction. According to a forecast from Navigant Research, the global revenue for the indoor air quality monitoring and management market, driven by new building standards and regulations as well as a rebounding economy, will grow 80% to $5.6 billion by 2020. Indoor air quality monitoring will continue to move away from passive systems and toward intelligent systems that provide feedback to operators on how the delivery of ventilation air relates to the distribution of building occupants. Smart infrastructure for environmental and energy systems promises to enable a transformation of post -industrial communities to create \"Cities 3.0\": innovative, efficient, and low-carbon. Biomass Energy: CNY has thousands of acres of available \"marginal\" agricultural lands to produce sufficient fast -growing willow crops to supply a network of small, on -site biomass energy facilities serving municipal facilities, schools, hospitals and businesses and medium -sized (up to 35 MW) wholesale power stations with a focus on rural areas. In addition to marginal agricultural land, willow can be grown on former industrial sites so that these areas can become productive community assists while simultaneously addressing concerns at these sites related to human health and environment. The residential biomass heating market grew by 34% fro m 2000 to 2010 with a cost advantage of 25 - 50% over propane and heating oil, and propane price spikes, like in the winter of 2014, tend to exacerbate this gap. Promising breakthroughs in the bulk distribution of biomass fuels and development of regional biomass heating clusters will increase consumer confidence in residential and commercial installations. The Biomass Thermal Energy Council anticipates 20% residential and commercial growth through 2020 in oil -dependent markets like Massachusetts with additional clusters likely to develop in New York, Vermont, Maine, and Minnesota. Biomass power and heat is among the most mature renewable energy technologies, with large potential markets for second generation biofuels from agricultural and forestry waste stre ams and from bioenergy crops grown on otherwise unproductive land. Most CNY environmental and energy systems manufacturers have limited resources for R&D and product development. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 34 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Health & Environment A.1Water Quality Systems: CNY has an opportunity to leverage strengths in subc lusters in Environmental Consulting Services, Water Quality, and Water Resources to meet rising national and global needs for solutions in these areas via exports of professional services of CNY firms. The world's market for water- related goods and servic es was estimated at $483 billion in 2010 and is projected to be over $600 billion by 2016. Globally, an estimated $89 billion was spent on capital equipment for water collection, treatment and distribution in 2010 with $82 billion spent on wastewater colle ction and treatment. Key markets include water and wastewater infrastructure, advanced treatment, monitoring, and upgrades; stormwater management and CSOs; industrial energy efficiency; agricultural uses including bio -digesters for concentrated animal feed operations (CAFOs); and a growing demand for water treatment technologies related to exploration and production of gas and oil through hydrofracking. Biomimicry, learning from and then emulating natural forms, processing and ecosystems to create more sust ainable designs, offers great opportunity for research, design and manufacturing in CNY and plays to our strengths. Biomimicry is an emerging design approach in the realms of clean tech that uses designs found in nature as the template for creating modern industrial products and processes. Biomimicry is a rapidly expanding field in which new designs, materials, and processes are inspired by adaptations observed in nature. Papers published in the field have increased an order of magnitude in 15 years. From nano -scale materials to biomedical applications, biodegradable materials, robotics, urban and landscape design, architecture and construction, new products, industries, and practices are springing from biomimetic centers at Harvard, UC Berkeley, Stanford, M IT, Duke, and elsewhere. A growing number of industries are working with consultants, such as Biomimicry 3.8 (www.biomimicry.net), to develop more efficient and sustainable products and industrial processes. The limiting factors between the animal, plant, and microbial models in nature and the industries and entrepreneurs in search of sustainable solutions can be addressed through an informatics platform that facilitates retrieval of existing models and predicts where to search for new ones. Such an informatics platform, combined with collaborations among field biologists, natural historians, informaticists, computer scientists, engineers, designers, entrepreneurs, and business experts, can expand the pipeline of ideas, shortening the path to market for new designs and products, spinning off upstarts, and accelerating the discovery of sustainable solutions. To date, a handful of companies have created products or materials that mimic, or are inspired by nature, notably Interface's line of Entropy carpet tiles. New applications are making wind turbine blades and solar PV technology more productive and making more efficient use of energy, water, and materials in everything from bullet trains to personal electronics. According to the Da Vinci Index, a database tracking scholarly activity, research and development in this area has increased tenfold since the millennium with the number of peer -reviewed papers now reaching about 3,000 annually. Patents for biometric innovations are also up: 67 were issued in 2012 as compared to just 3 in 2000. SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry and several other CNY firms and institutions have targeted biomimicry for strategic strengthening and development. The region has an opportunity to earn recognition as a leader in the practice, attracting firms that are strategically targeting biomimicry as a differentiator for product development. The region is well poised to focus on biomimicry as a template for precision environmental design. This emerging field is predicted to represent $300 billion of the CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 35 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Health & Environment | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1annual U.S. GDP, account for 1.6 million U.S. jobs and represent $1 trillion of global GDP by 2025.

It is estimated by 2020 that there will be 50 billion smart devices worldwide including smartphones, PCs, tablets, UAS, smart cars, smart TVs, wearables, and home automation, as well as applications in health, finance, and smart grid technologies. However, this sector is sorely lacking a cohesive set of standards for communication, security and interoperability. Security is not built into the foundation of the IOT. Many of the embedded programs in these systems have demonstrated vulnerabilities which have already been exploited. The IOT in general and the command -and- control (C2) of critical infrastructure based on the IOT is vulnerable to attack. Mission and Definition of D2D/IOT The mission of this project is to penetrate this rapidly growing industry by developing the core technology to provide secure, systematic application of algorithms and architecture to distributed sensor data and dynamic networked databases to make smart, trusted, real time decisions. The focus of the project will be to secure the IOT at its foundation and enable its adoption in large industry vertical markets that are already located within the region. The intended outcome is to catalyze significant economic growth in Central New York by leveraging embedded regional strengths to develop a \"best- in- world\" capability. Regional Assets The embedded regional strengths were identified by the Battelle Technolo gy Partnership Practice as part of its work in developing the Center State CEO Metropolitan Business Plan: Over 50 companies directly involved in Data to Decisions (D2D) Systems and Technology, employing over 9,000 workers in Central New York Technology competencies in sensing, signal processing and controls, cyber security, systems integration and engineering, machine learning, and decision support. Existing industry clusters within the region that will need this technology including digital electronics, information systems, biomedical technology, financial services and environmental control products. Battelle estimated that there are almost 40,000 jobs in these industries in the region, which will be supported by the development of these core technologie s. From 2009 through the first half of 2012, 935 D2D inventions were patented in CNY. This represents nearly \u00bd of all patents generated in this region during that time. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 44 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Information Security A.1Significant institutional assets to support the effort including the Air Force's Rese arch Laboratory's Information Directorate in Rome, which issues $1.2 billion of research and development contracts each year, the CASE Center at Syracuse University, and university engineering, computer science and information studies departments at Syrac use University, Cornell, Clarkson, SUNY Polytechnic and Binghamton. Benefits of the Project Beyond supporting growth of existing local industry, the D2D/1IIOT initiative will attract more venture capital, more new firms, and research dollars into the region. It is estimated by regional industry experts in this field that if these technologies can be nurtured here that over 1,000 new high quality jobs can be created within 7 years, 132 new firms will form, and total economic impact will be in excess of $1 billion. This effort will support other URI initiatives in financial services, precision medicine and environmental health, and UAS. It will also help the region attract and retain highly educated talent. Key Challenges and Opportunities There is rapid growth in the number of interconnected devices, and this is a large enough market to be worth attention According to a report by Strategy Analytics, there were nearly 12 billion connected devices in use at the end of 2014. That is the equivalent of 1.7 devices for every person on the planet. That ratio will rise to 4.3 interconnected devices per person in 2020, when 33 billion devices will be in use.2 Ericsson predicts that smartphone subscriptions are set to double by 2020. By this time, 70 percent of the world's population will have a smartphone. Ericsson forecasts that there will be 26 billion connected devices by 2020.3 The global Internet of Things market will grow to $1.7 trillion in 2020, up from $655.8 billion in 2014 according to research firm IDC (International Data Corporation), as more devices come on line and a bevy of platforms and services grow up around them5. Morgan Stanley analysts found that the Internet of Things will likely have a positive effect on more than a dozen industries, including: Factory Automation - This area co uld see enhanced efficiency from process monitoring and supervision, remote management and optimization and optimal energy management. Precision Agriculture - Real -time analysis of weather data could drive increase d revenues for the industry, and farmers could also grow productivity and revenues by an even larger amount. Utilities - \"Smart meters\" for electricity and water usage can lead to better resource management. Healthcare - Big data could trigger more timely care interventions, especially in conjunction with \"smart\" medical devices that transmit information. Retail - The use of real-time technology could improve inventory management and lower the cost of goods sold. 2 Strategy Analytics; Connected World: The Internet of Things and Connected Devices in the year 2020 3 Ericsson Mobility Report; June 2015, page 3. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 45 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Information Security | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1Insurance - The Internet of Things could drive major changes in business models and profits, as auto insurers increasingly adopt telematics, which combine the use of telecommunications with computers4. There is a lack of security for these devices, and many of these systems have documented vulnerabilities that have been exploited. Numerous meetings and discussions among the committee and with representatives of IOT businesses that build the applications have revealed that there are significant vulnerabilities in IOT products, many of which h ave already been \"hacked\" and that device makers have no widely accepted standards to which they can build the products, nor is there an existing method to have them certified by an outside third party. These vulnerabilities mean that these devices will not perform up to expectations, and could have significant safety and security vulnerabilities. Various publications have reported on security failures, noting that IOT devices have been used to launch malware attacks5. Knowledgeable observers have reporte d that IOT devices lacking adequate security could become tools for terrorist attacks, and that Websites already exist which can identify IOT connected devices and identify their security vulnerabilities6. Security specialists believe that even aircraft have specific vulnerabilities that would allow attackers to take control of the aircraft7. Major companies are making significant investments in technology to protect their systems, CISCO being the most prominent8. IBM has decided to invest $3 billion in IOT9. CNY has (within the region) significant assets to address the opportunity The opportunity presented within the D2D/IOT space is one that is addressable within this region. Over the last year, we have held numerous group and individual meetings to identify and link (in some cases) these resources. Within the region, the key resource that provides credibility in this effort is the CASE Center at Syracuse University. CASE describes itself as \"New York State's premier applied research c enter for interdisciplinary expertise in the broad area of complex information intensive systems, including monitoring and control, predictive analysis, information fusion, computational intelligence, wireless communications and networks, security and assurance\"10. The Air Force Research Laboratory -Information Directorate (AFRL) at the Rome Research site is a pre-eminent research and technology center for the Air Force which has as its mission: \"To lead the discovery, development, and integration of affordable warfighting information technologies for our air, space, and cyberspace forces.11\" 4 Steven Norton; \"Internet of Things Market to Reach $1.7 trillion by 2020: IDC; Wall Street Journal, June 2, 2015 5 Readw rite; The Internet of things has been hacked, and its turning nast y 6 See, for example, Shodan at http://www.shodanhq.com/help/tour 7 http://thehackernews.com/2014/08/airplanes -can-be-hacked- through 4.html or Raj J.

The Team for Research in Ubiquitous Secure Technology (TRUST) is focused on the development of cyber security science and technology that will radically transform the ability of organizations to design, build, and operate trustworthy information systems for the nation's critical infrastructure. Established as a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center, TRUST is addressing technical, operational, legal, policy, and economic issues affecting security, privacy, and data protection as well as the challenges of developing, deploying, and using trustworthy systems. The Battelle Technology Partnership Practice analyzed the CenterState economy and found that there are over 50 companies that are directly involve d in D2D Systems and Technology, employing over 9,000 workers in Central New York. Battelle generated this information through patent research, a review of SBIR awards, and direct interviews with the companies. Battelle noted that these companies are not found in any one traditional industry cluster definition. Instead they share a set of technology competencies in sensing, signal processing, cybersecurity, systems integration and engineering, data mining and decision support. The region's colleges and universities have a large array of electrical and computer engineering, information studies, and programs in topics such as cybersecurity and human and computer interaction. These universities produce graduates with associates, bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees. These include: Syracuse University, SUNY Oswego, LeMoyne College, Cornell University, Clarkson University, Binghamton University, Onondaga Community College, Cayuga Community College, Morrisville State College, SUNY Polytechnic Institute, Tompkins -Cortland Community College. As the list above indicates, CNY has within or n earby it multiple specialized research centers, businesses, and colleges and universities generating graduates that can sustain the growth of this industry. D2D/IOT devices are ubiquitous, and will impact a very diverse set of products and markets, many of which are represented with Central New York. Therefore building the D2D/IOT technology platform will be an opportunity sufficiently large enough to transform the economy. Smart devices include applications including smart phones, personal computers (PCs), Tablets, unmanned aerial systems (UAS), smart cars, smart grid, wearables, home automation and home appliances. Many of these devices require capa bilities in: Sensing and detection Signal processing and controls Cybersecurity Overall systems and device integration involving hardware and software Embedded software programs Wireless communication Many CNY industry clusters will make use of the common D2D/IOT technology platform. Many of which are being considered as focus areas for the URI including: (1) Insurance and Financial services, (2) Biomedical particularly with regard to bioinformatics; (3) Cleantech/Environmental, (4) UAS, (5) Digital and electronic devices. (Battelle, 2013). These industries or large sub clusters of these industries have CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 47 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Information Security | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1high employment concentrations in the region (LQ's above 1.20), and pay high wages (See: Battelle 2015 updates). Battelle's specific recommendations for industry focus were as follows: \"The most developed market for D2D Systems Technology activities in Central New York is the defense and national security market, which has grown with the presence of the Air Force Research Lab in Rome, New York\"12. \"Cybersecurity for homeland defense is another focus area closely related to the Central New York's traditional activities with DoD in D2D Systems and Technology\"13. \"Closely related to this military strength is the emergence of a new market for commercial unmanned aerial systems\". \"Environmental and energy monitoring is another emerging commercial use of D2D Systems and Technology capabilities\". \"The medical market is also ripe for D2D Systems and Technology capabilities\". \"Financial Services is another growing market for D2D Systems and Technology products and services, as well as being identified as an emerging cluster in Central New York\". These jobs will help retain STEM graduates, and the private commercial components could be attractive jobs for graduating international students. These jobs would help CNY retain the college level workforce it generates. Therefore, jobs in this t echnology, and in the industries that use this technology, will help address reducing the unemployment rate, create technology driven opportunity, will raise incomes back toward the national average and will help the region secure the future of multiple critical industry clusters. Working through these other clusters, D2D/ IOT will be large enough to have a transformative impact on the economy. As a result of D2D/IOT committee activity to reach out to potential user markets, we have begun to identify potential projects in defense/aerospace (Honeywell), Biomedical (GE/Omnyx) and Cleantec h/home automation (Carrier). D2D/IOT is a highly innovative component of the Central New York Economy Battelle found that from 2009 through the first half of 2012, there were 935 D2D Systems and Technology patented inventions in Central New York which represents nearly half of all patents generated in the region14. The leading technology capabilities of Central New York's D2D Systems and Technology platform that were identified through company interviews and patent reviews were: Sensing and detection associated with signal processing and controls Cybersecurity Overall systems and device integration involving the interface of hardware and software15. Battelle also noted that Central New York Universities play an active ro le in D2D Systems and Technology innovation, particularly Cornell University and Syracuse University. Approximately 10% of the patents identified in the study above were assigned to these two universities, 73 to Cornell and 14 to Syracuse University. Battelle 12 Battelle Technology Partnership Practice; Business Plan for Data to Decisions Systems and Technology Innov ation A llianc e, p.8, Novembe r Ibid. p9. 14 Battelle Technology Practice Partnership; Business Plan for Data to Decisions Systems and Technology Innovation Alliance, p.2., November 2013. 15 Idem. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 48 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Information Security A.1concluded \"these university patents reflect the intellectual property from basic research discoveries, and as a result have the potential to offer disruptive technology rather than incremental improvements\"16. Battelle also stated that \"discussions with university officials revealed that it is common for software artifacts -involving the structure, architecture, use cases and requirements to design D2D Systems and Technology systems- to be created to demonstrate important research findings; however these research efforts are not being assessed for their broader commercial value nor fully developed into ...products. This suggests a possibility to create new D2D ventures based on cutting edge research activities found at universities in the region\"23. Key Finding # 6: Interviews with D2D/IOT executives in the region agreed that D2D/IOT could be a significant opportunity for the region, but is not without its challenges. KS&R conducted an Online Bulletin Board focus group with a panel of 18 experts located throughout the region between April 24 and April 27, 2012. KS&R concluded: \"The majority of respondents \"buy in\" to systems and sensors as a potential area of economic stimulus, but with some reservations\". The strengths identified by the respondents were: experience in the sensor industry, UAS testi ng, and educational research capabilities. Most agree that there is a viable market which requires a diversified marketing effort; the talent resources exist to start, but new talent must be generated or brought in; that the project needs commitment from NYS and the invested parties to secure dedicated resources; and funding appears to be available17. The weaknesses identified by the group include: the definition of intelligent systems and sensors was too vague (since addressed by Battelle), the NYS tax burden, the lack of historical cooperation throughout the region of companies, overreliance on DoD and government spending, historical application to a few specific industries, more developed regions/players in the space, infrastructure and talent base18. The respondents recommended that sensing technologies be made more attractive to local universities; strengthen the presence of AFRL in Rome; identify the skill sets and workforce base to develop and produce this technology; and to identify key companies which will put identified resources into the initiative19. The respondents also recommended that a new entity be created that would be dedicated to this initiative. Battelle's interviews revealed similar challenges: The ability to convert defense and national security -based capabilities into commercial opportunities. Larg e existing D2D users serving non-defense markets lack an awareness of technical capabilities of D2D companies in the region. Linkages to universities and commercialization of Universit y D2D systems are limited and pose a development gap. 16 Idem. 17 KS&R; Brookings Initiative Community Input Report , p 9-10. 18 Idem. 19 Ibid., p.14 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 49 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Information Security | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1Generating sufficient numbers of new graduates in D2D systems remains an issue20. Based on recent interviews conducted with industry, the development of an \"Assurance Lab\" to provide independent 3rd party verification of the efficacy of D2D/IOT has emerged as a leading concept of how to move the project forward in CNY. The ALab, would develop standards, test those products and services to meet those standards, provide consulting help to the industry, or engaged in systems design to build the industry here21. Strategies, Tactics and Objectives Finding # 1: A new multi -regional entity should be created that would be dedicated to the implementation this initiative. Objective #1: Secure $6.5 million to staff and operate the One Institute in its initial year. Secure $30 million to build, equip, and operate the Assurance Lab in the same year.. Strategy #1 - Create a regional structure to implement the initiative. Tactics: Collaborate with the One Institute for the Internet of Things Establish the \"Assurance Lab\" Hire staff and initiate marketing of services to the private sector Finding #2: There is a lack of historical cooperation between the key D2D companies in the region. Within their own ma rkets, some of the key companies may be fierce competitors. Can a framework for collaboration be built to create a nationally viable competitive entity? Objective #2: Create an alliance of local D2D firms and institutions to market the capabilities of th e region, create a secure collaboration portal to foster deal matching and secure 100 regional companies to participate in the portal in year 1. The One Institute for the Internet of Things will create a portal will be an internet based collaboration tool that will connect the D2D/IOT systems and technology community. This will serve as a forum for consistent communications, information sharing and a collaboration tool. 20 Battelle Technology Partnership Practice; Business Plan for Data to Decisions Systems and Technology Innovation Alliance, p. 12-13. 21 Information gleaned from multiple interviews conducted by the 1IIOT group in 2014 and 2015. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 50 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Information Security A.1Strategy #2 - The One Institute will organize new consortiums in targeted markets t o provide services to D2D/IOT users. Tactics: Identify new opportunities for collaboration to meet the needs of new customers Create a secure collaboration portal to foster deal making Finding #3: The most developed market for D2D Systems and Technology activity in CNY is the defense and national security market, which has grown with the presence of the AFRL in Rome. However, historically there has been an overreliance on DoD and government spending. Is it possible to convert defense and nati onal security based capabilities into commercial opportunities? Objective #3: Identify and successfully engage at least 50 companies in Year 1 Strategy #3 - Create a regional capacity to reach out to local, national and international commercial customers for our existing D2D companies Tactics: Create a market research capacity Create a campaign to reach out to potential customers Hire a market research director Finding # 3: Most local industry observers agree that this is a viable market which requires a diversified marketing effort. Large, existing D2D users not located within the region lack an awareness of the technical capabilities of D2D companies in CNY. Objective #4: Create a systematic capability to maintain a marketing effort for the c apabilities of the region throughout the life of the One Institute. Strategy #4 - Advance an understanding of the key capabilities of industry, non -profit research organizations and universities in D2D Systems and Technology in Central New York. Tactics: The One Institute will establish a repository which describes company capabilities, patents, publications, grant awards Finding # 5: D2D/IOT is a highly innovative component of the Central New York economy. However, linkages between CNY businesses and regional universities and commercialization of university D2D systems are limited and pose a development gap. CNY does not have a strong track record of commercializing university intellectual property. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 51 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Information Security | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1Objective #5: The One Institute and its co mponent organizations (such as the Assurance Lab) will seek to create at least 10 MOUs and NDAs focused on commercializing technology or solutions devised by Cornell, SU, AFRL, or within the One Institute itself. Strategy #5 - Develop a capacity to ident ify and bring to market D2D intellectual property which may be held by regional colleges, universities, or other research organizations such as AFRL. Tactics: Create MOUs/NDAs that will allow access to intellectual property of universities and organizations to businesses both within and outside the region Finding # 6: There may be more developed regions/players in this space. How does CNY build a niche for itself in this industry? Objective #6: Have a sub- consortium established in each market area within one year. Strategy #6 - Focus its efforts in industry clusters that are well developed in the region looking for points of intersection between our D2D/IOT capacity and user applications needed by local industry (focus on the region's existing core application clusters of health technology, environmental technology, banking/finance, defense and UAS and information technology). Tactics: Create sub- consortium vehicles for collaboration in: Precision Medicine Environmental technology The UAS market with NuAir Banking/Finance Defense Information Technology Finding # 7: The talent exists to start, but to sustain this industry new talent needs to be generated internally or recruited from the outside; generating sufficient numbers of new graduates in D2D systems remains an issue. Objective #7: Since it is assumed that 3000 net new jobs will be created within ten y ears, seek to create at least half of these (1500) through local efforts. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 52 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Information Security A.1Strategy #7 -- Attract, train and educate, and retain talent in relevant skill areas Tactics: Create new and enhance existing programs at regional universities to generate more graduates in D2D fields Create a highly visible program of internships with regional D2D businesses for college students Work with the CASE center to assist foreign studen ts in this field to obtain green cards and citizenship status Finding # 7: CNY needs to identify key companies, both within and outside the region, that will put resources into this initiative. The invested parties will have to be able to secure new res ources. Objective #8: Secure $18 million to build an internal research capacity in the One Institute. This research organization can be used to solve problems for clients in D2D/IOT and will create the Intellectual Property that client companies will wan t to license. Secure at least $5 million in private R&D contracts. Use these contracts to build research capacity at the One Institute and the Assurance Lab. In addition, seek to secure $5 million in investment capital. This capital can be used to invest in new start - ups in the D2D/IOT space. Strategy #8 - Identify the original funding and build a sustainable financial source for this effort. Tactics: Secure initial capital to create the One Institute Secure one or more private sector contracts to fund ongoing operation Build research partnership with support of an expanded \"Grants for Growth\" program Identify and secure source of investment capital to support new company formation in D2D. Ideally this capital would be internally generated by the IOT who secured from public sources such that the money can be re-invested in D2D/IOT start -ups. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 53 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Information Security | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1 Upstate Revitalization Initiative Strategic Proposal: Manufacturing Background Manufacturing remains one of the largest employment sectors in the Central New York economy representing over 20,000 employees, over $1.5 billion in wages, and the largest export industries in the region. Some specific sectors within manufacturing in our region are poised for growth; while firms and assets in these sectors are fragmented, they are becoming leaner and more productive. Creating growth will require help for these firms and assets to innovate, update their business models, redeploy assets toward newer products and emerg ing markets, and develop advanced manufacturing capabilities. Manufacturing is defined manufactured products and manufacturing processes based upon innovative, cutting edge science and technology, usually executed by relatively high -skilled workers, who r eceive above average wages. Manufacturing offers high potential for growth in our region in the following clusters: Digital and Electronic Devices, Packaging and Precision Metalworking, and Metals Production and Manufacturing (as well as portions of Biosciences, Clean Energy and Environmental Systems, and Agribusiness that are discussed in other areas of this initiative. While some of these sectors at one point may have represented globally uncompetitive manufacturing sectors, given the products, processes or customers they are serving, they have strong potential for the future. The Manufacturing sector contains some of the most innovative companies of some of the region's strongest advanced industries. What is more, these industries also drive productivity in other portions of our local economy. They support long supply chains, and they stimulate local economies through the spending of their workers. Characterized by their deep involvement with technological innovation and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) workers, they create good jobs in dozens of high - value, high -technology fields within manufacturing industries such as metal fabrication, data- to- decisions, and medical devices to fast -growing industries such as computer software and energy industries. Through their activities, these industries encompass the nation's and our community's \"tech\" sector at its broadest and most consequential. Central New York has outstanding resources that can support growth in the manufacturing and advanced industries. It has abundant water and energy resources along with access to an extensive distribution and transportation network. The advanced manufacturing sector in general tends to align with the region's top exporting sectors. A 2011 analysis by the Bro okings Institution indicated that the region's major export industries are Machinery Manufacturing, Chemical Manufacturing, Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing, Primary Metal Manufacturing, and Transportation Equipment Manufacturing. The manufact uring sector undergirds and connects the most innovative elements of the region's strongest advanced industries. All told, over 500 companies are in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing businesses directly penetrate global markets and align with the re gion's top exporting sectors. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 54 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Manufacturing A.1 Businesses and industries interested in attracting and retaining the best and brightest talent are well served by doing so in Central New York, because it is in our urban cores where talent can find the activity and dynamic lifestyle they seek. Every community in our region contains a main street or neighborhood business district that serves as its core and by applying a series of strategic investment principles to their future development, the Central New York region is pois ed to thrive. Key Stats Establishments, 2013 518 Change in Establishments, 2001 -2013 -7.7% Employment, 2013 20,373 Change in Employment, 2001 -2013 -31.1% Average Annual Wages, 2013 $61,631 Industry Output, 2013 $8 billion Value Added per Worker, 2013 $100,989 Industrial R&D, 2012 $150.5 million Exports, 2014 $1,490 million Change in Exports, 2003 -2014 $95.8 million Projected U.S. Sales Growth, 2014 -2019 2.62% Key Challenges and Opportunities Clusters of concentrated manufacturing sectors; such as Data -to Decision, Precision Metal Working, Environmental Systems and Clean Tech (AMTEC), Biosciences, and Packaging; represent particularly strong growth market opportunities for CNY rms. Central New York has particularly signicant concentration of clustered companies in critical high tech growth sectors. There are emerging technology trends that can revolutionize manufacturing and be the source of new products. These include increased automation, big data, efciency through cloud computing, and t he increased deployment of connected sensors and devices. Our region can leverage these clustered companies to attract outside national and international rms to become part of the regional cluster using NYS Start -up and other NYS resources and benets. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 55 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Manufacturing | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1Central New York has the ability to excel in creating and promoting a wearable device and monitoring cluster with a particularly strong emphasis on devices with health -related uses. By combining the nano -tech, semi -conductor, advanced manufacturing, medical device and healthcare industries into a focused cluster with an Institute and Research Center, the region could excel in creating, designing and manufacturing a variety of wearable devices with a particularly strong emphasis on devices with health -related uses. We would attract outside national rms to become part of the regional cluster using NYS Start -up and other NYS resources and benets. Central New York has the capability to create and grow a geothermal energy cluster consistent with and supported by other NYS renewable energy clusters. In the last 10 years, the Central / Finger lakes region has gone from 5 to 30 geothermal installation companies who fan out around residential, mid -grade commercial, and high- grade commercial work. European brands dominate the residential market since they have combined bottom up and top down pressure. Europeans are ahead of the U.S. market in the adoption of geothermal as the foundation of HVAC with solar as the secondary renewable source. In the U.S. residential geoth ermal sales tend to cluster around manufacturing hot spots with strong sales and distribution networks. Opportunities include govt. incentives to shorten ROI. Geothermal HVAC, when not combined with solar, raises base electricity usage but lowers peak dem and. CNY and Finger Lakes Geothermal installation specialists are experiencing exponential growth in the last ve years. Also, they expect to see start- ups and traditional HVAC companies respond to the increasing demand CNY has signicant industry leading manufacturing rms that offer strong growth opportunities that must be developed and pursued to anchor and enhance their presence in our region. CNY has key industry leading manufacturing rms and high tech companies. A focused regional effort will be able to assist them in identifying and attracting to our regional a relevant cluster of companies and organizations that will help them innovates and grow within our region. Examples of such companies include: Novelis, NUCOR, and Stickley. CNY's signicant and diversied manufacturing industries utilize a highly skilled labor force but struggle to nd and retain high quality workers especially those with strong technical skills. Central New York has multiple level manufacturing workforce and \"skills gap\" iss ues. They have persons that are unemployed, underemployed, and in long term poverty that are unprepared for even entry level jobs in manufacturing. They have mid -skill level openings for which there are limited qualied workers. They have advanced skill positions for which they cannot attract workers. And, a quarter to a third of the aging workforce will be eligible for retirement within the next decade Central New York lacks nationally relevant shovel- ready research and business parks for medium to large manufacturers and cluster concentrations that must be remedied to accelerate advanced manufacturing and technology sector growth. Strong manufacturing and high -tech growth companies and clusters must be able to quickly decide and build facilities and locate operations in order to take advantage of market opportunities. Signicant and relevant shovel -ready sites supported by research CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 56 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Manufacturing A.1operations must be available to attract and keep industry leading companies and their supply networks. CNY must maintain a st rong transportation network in the form of an integrated interstate highway system, rail network, and international commercial aviation airport with sufcient capacity to support a strong advanced manufacturing network. Advanced manufacturing and high -tech sectors rely on easily accessible, cost effective and highly efcient transportation systems to connect their businesses with customers and suppliers in our ever expanding global economy. CNY is well- served by a network of small to medium -sized manufacturing companies with a skilled but aging ownership base which must be transitioned to ensure company operations grow in our region. CNY has traditionally been the home of a diversied collection of small to medium - sized high tech and manufacturing rms. Ma ny of these rms are family owned and the ownership base is aging out. In the past, the community has lost the opportunity to retain these vibrant companies and their supply networks when the company is merged with or purchased by rms outside of our regio n. In order for growth and sustainability, investments in and nancing strategies for these rms must be effectively pursued. Key Manufacturing Data In 2011, Battelle noted that the CNY region has over 7,000 Precision Sensing jobs and a concentration that is more than twice that of the nation. Metals Production and Manufacturing is 71 percent more concentrated in the Central New York region than the nation with 4,946 regional jobs (Battelle, 2011). In 2011, Battelle reported that the CNY region has 4,3 84 jobs in the biosciences cluster, a location quotient of 1.41 and is the number one R&D cluster for the region's academic institutions. Overall the health care industry is projected to be one of the fastest- growing industries and it is expected to acco unt for one out of every five jobs created by 2014. Central New York holds a unique set of health care assets, including a large number of acclaimed health care institutions, high quality academic medical and nursing colleges, global bioscience and medical technology companies, and several prestigious higher education institutions with significant research capability. Morgan Stanley: Wearable Technology is a potential $1.6 Trillion business in the near future. IMS Research predicts 100 million wearable wireless medical devices by 2016. Clean Energy and Environmental Systems (CEES) cluster includes more than 10,000 jobs and ranks eighth out of the nation's 100 largest metropolitan areas in concentration of green jobs in the private sector (Brookings, 2011). Geothermal Energy offers significant opportunities. Geothermal HVAC systems remove four times more kilowatt hours of consumption from the electrical grid per dollar spent than photovoltaic and wind power add to the electrical grid.

CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 60 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Manufacturing A.1 Upstate Revitalization Initiative Strategic Proposal: Tourism Background Over six million potential travelers live within a three hour drive (and more than 130 million people live within a day's drive of the region) of the vastly diverse destination product mix found in Central New York. Visitors arrive in the region for a multitude of travel purposes such as leisure, sports, campus visits, conventions, business travel and visiting friends and relatives. No matter the trip purpose, the resulting overall visitation propels the tourism industry into a leading component of the regional economy. This multi -faceted industry provides valued jobs across all skill sets and creates both direct and indirect business activity. T he double digit growth in regional travel spending of nearly 17% since 2009 outpaced growth rates across all but two other upstate New York economic development council regions. The $1.18 billion in regional visitor spending in 2013 supported over 25,000 jobs representing a payroll of $544 million and generated $86 million in local tax revenue. Tourism spending across Central New York saved every individual household in the region $490 in overall taxes in 2013. It is this connection between visitor spending levels and tax generation that is motivating local leaders to recognize and elevate the industry as a critical economic engine for the region. Over the past five years, capital investments in tourism related projects transformed the look, appeal and a wareness of the Central New York regional destination. The diverse product mix has emerged as the region's most prominent unique trait best captured within the regional \"do your thing\" brand. The strategies of the Central New York Regional Economic Devel opment Council directed investment support for hotel facilities, breweries, wineries, trails, event venues, branded marketing outreach, sports development, transportation, and recreational amenities to broaden the destination experience of the region. Con tinued improvements to urban- based arts and cultural amenities, community aesthetics, culinary connections to agriculture, transportation infrastructure access, particularly in air, rail and public transit, and hospitality workforce add tremendous depth wi thin the overall regional destination experience. Sustainability of success depends on marketing outreach to drive new customer exposure, infrastructure improvements to enhance customer satisfaction and additional development to complement overall offerin gs. Incorporating those investments in the overall product mix requires an emphasis on creating new markets, including international travel which is currently producing over 19% of the region's exports. Global opportunities reinforce state tourism effort s and enhance opportunities for educational institutions, healthcare providers, historical attributes, and agribusiness. Modern discussions of tourism impacts extend beyond these traditional economic benefits. Tourism transforms communities. Recent rese arch on the benefits of destination investments, enhancements and marketing campaigns show direct correlations, what experts have deemed a \"halo effect,\" between the positive destination messages and the attractiveness of that destination as a place to liv e, start a business, attend college, buy a second home or retire. While destination marketing efforts create CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 61 CNY RISING | APPENDICES T ourism | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1positive awareness, destination development initiatives improve Central New York's urban cores, amplify regional impacts from Destiny USA, stimulate untapped markets for educational and medical institutions, foster cultural support, and provide connections to history, natural beauty, recreational, entertainment, sports, agricultural, and waterfront assets. Tourism is a catalytic driver for supporting and expanding other industries in the region from agriculture to manufacturing. Additional investments in tourism will drive impacts across virtually every other industry sector through enhanced overall desirability and community pride. These new econ omic opportunities create jobs for regional residents, tax revenue for local governments, and success particularly within the small business sector. Tourism; which by design seeks to improve the quality of life for area residents, is an umbrella which all of the industry clusters can leverage to recruit new businesses and attract quality talent. Creating and promoting a great place to visit ultimately builds a great place to live and a place resident will be proud to call home.

An opportunity exists to create synergy across regional tourism development proposals while also incentivizing developers and investors, from both the public and private sector, to create more unique and innovative quality of life and culturally stimulating assets. ROOST, a regional tourism development office in the A dirondacks, has combined promotional outreach with product development assistance to create a more cohesive, success driven approach for increasing tourism success across the North Country region. 22 Data combines both Tourism and Retail industries CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 62 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | T ourism A.1Visitor profile research currently being compiled by Young Strategies clearly shows product development opportunities and experiential shortcomings described by Central New York regional visitors. Successful destination areas in other states including Louisville, Memphis, and Kansas City are creating higher levels of tourism growth and impact in the communities through the utilization of state authorized Tourism Development Zones. Regional destination master planning and subsequent implementation was identified in Reach Market Planning's 2012 Destination Market Analysis as a basic future need for transitioning to become a stronger more dynamic destination. Development incentive programs were specifically identified as a component of the master planning process. Domestic and international awareness of Central New Yo rk's strengths is relatively limited, even among regional residents . Tourism provides a definitive method for creating a positive introduction to the area, first through marketing and promotion and second through visitation. Current consumers recognize the distinctiveness and variety of the connected region as an unique selling point and want to see more promotional efforts showcasing the connections between dynamic urban environments and compelling rural countryside. The 2012 Syracuse Destination Market Analysis found that the destination marketing organization serving Syracuse is funded at 33% less than the average across its identified competitive set. Efforts to promote the region to new markets under a common brand showed dynamic interest in the destination. These marketing efforts produced a year over year increase in website visits of 4,900%. Brand development research revealed that positive destination awareness among regional residents is vital for increasing overall economic development impacts, particularly with 52% of overnight visitors to Syracuse traveling to visit friends and relatives. Vibrant downtown areas become unique destination assets acting as the ultimate catalyst for diverse visitor engagement. The juxtaposition of highly compelling u rban and countryside experiences has been identified by the region's visitors as a distinctive advantage over other regions. Destination marketing structure currently exists within county tourism promotion agencies and I Love New York designated vacation regions. Actual and potential visitors recognize the connective attributes of the destination region served by the Central New York Regional Economic Development Council, but a sustainable regional structure is not currently in place. This missing structural component makes packaging and communicating key intersections with CNY economic assets, recruiting of strategic events, engaging new market opportunities, and creating a service focused workforce more difficult and less timely on the regional scale. ROO ST, a regional tourism development office in the Adirondacks, has combined promotional outreach with product development assistance to create a more cohesive, success driven approach for increasing tourism success across the North Country region. The 2012 Syracuse Destination Market Analysis found that the destination marketing organization serving Syracuse has 23% fewer positions on average than its identified competitive set. Regional programming across Central New York is showing clear opportunities for further engagement and will be identified more completely with the 2015 strategic planning work by Young Strategies. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 63 CNY RISING | APPENDICES T ourism | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1 Transportation plays a vital role in supporting tourism flow through the region. Central New York's transportation infrastructure is missing key elements that visitors need to actively impact the region and residents need to better realize the role of the region as a dynamic destination. Visitors to the region consistently identify wayfinding signage as one of the most significant visitor e xperience shortcomings, most recently within the 2012 Syracuse Destination Market Analysis. This shortcoming limits the overall level of impact on the region as connections between attractions and visitor assets are missed by new guests to the community. Air service to the region is often perceived as limited and costly. Improvements to Syracuse Hancock International Airport provide a great foundation for future growth to the visitor economy. Convention attendees list walkable destinations (a vibrant urban core) and consistent shuttling as compelling components of a vibrant convention district. Syracuse's convention district ranks poorly in both categories. Tourism businesses and cultural institutions agree that I -81 is a regional decision of dramatic proportions and business survival through multiple years of construction will depend on dynamic programming, potential operational subsidies and monumental communication outreach. The high poverty level and lack of significant economic opportunity in Syracuse l imits adequate funding for the arts and cultural institutions in the community thereby reducing the opportunity for them to become 'world class. ' Funding limitation impact the ability of these institutions to attract and engage travelers to visit cultural experiences in the region's thriving urban cores. Less visitor engagement causes less interest in the Central New York region as a business, educational and talent employment hub. Less cultural engagement also limits development in both innovation and creative related industries. Supporting Evidence: Routinely across the nation, (Science -Technology -Engineering -Math) STEM efforts are being reclassified as (Science -Technology -Engineering -Arts-Math) STEAM to incorporate the role of the arts in enhancing math a nd science based ventures. Successful cultural destination areas in other states like Maryland are utilizing Arts & Entertainment Districts to spark greater community engagement and higher funding support to boost cultural opportunities for visitors and re sidents alike. The 2012 Syracuse Destination Market Analysis identified cultural activity as a catalyst for developing dynamic sense of place. Visitor research shows a clear intersection between current regional strengths (culinary experiences, Destiny USA , education, year -round outdoor recreation (particularly skiing and fishing), and cool downtown experiences) and regional opportunities in cultural institutions.

Transportation and logistics infrastructure is vital to travel, trade, and tourism but even more urgent for leveraging access to markets, raw materials, distribution economics, industry growth, and a mobile workforce. Located within 500 miles of well over 100 million people, Central New York's transportation and logistics sector is well aligned to our region's physical assets. In addition, CNY is home to more than 13,000 transportation jobs and has experienced sustained growth in recent years, adding jo bs since 2001, despite the impacts of the recession. These jobs pay wages that are higher than the regional average and Central New York enjoys higher productivity than the national average (Battelle, BLS) in a sector with relatively low barriers to entry (Brookings). Investments in transportation and logistics infrastructure enhance competitiveness, productivity, quality of life, land use, and a safer environment. It is also a major decision factor for industries looking to site new facilities, relocate or expand. While ample evidence supports an undeniable need for physical rehabilitation of transportation infrastructure, many proponents focus on both direct and indirect job creation in the short term. However, studies including the Economic Development Research Group and the San Francisco Federal Reserve, have also found long -term gains and sustainable job growth from infrastructure investment. Transportation and logistics infrastructure, quite literally, move our economy.

Current projections indicate that ports along the Atlantic coast of the US will receive an increase in cargo, beginning in 2016. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey estimates that its cargo volume will double over the next decade. This is an increase in volume that these already busy coastal ports are unable to manage. CNY is in a unique position to benefit from this problem, with competitive freight rail service from Norfolk Southern and CSX and close proximity to the ports of New York and New Jersey, as well as easy access to Canadian ports an d its own seaport, in Oswego. Development of a multimodal hub and a robust Inland Port would make CNY an ideal location to handle this growth in imports along the east coast. Syracuse has the geographic benefit of being within 500 miles of 100,000,000 peo ple, which makes it uniquely situated with the confluence of E/W and N/S interstates, short line and mainline railroads, and a deep water port on Lake Ontario . CNY has also been recognized as the US region that is safest from natural disasters, making it an ideal haven for supply chain integrity. As shown at the Virginia Inland Port (VIP), the development of an inland port spurred the development of distribution centers and manufacturing facilities due to the availability of cost competitive container handling, creating 8,000 jobs and $750,000,000 in directly related private logistics investment in less than two decades. Globalization hit the CNY area hard from the mid 1970's through the early 1990's, and continued through the last recession. As a result, low skill employment opportunities have been greatly diminished. The build- out of an inland port and supporting distribution centers will create a demand for hundreds of jobs with relatively low barriers to entry and opportunities for growth. Working with the Syracuse area workforce development groups, the inland port will provide an opportunity for this sector of our urban population that needs just such an opportunity The CNY metals, agriculture and lumber industry all require improved availability and cost for train and container service. Two CNY metals and one agriculture business have committed CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 68 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Transportation & Logistics A.1almost $3,000,000 to expand Finger Lakes Railway service to connect to the inland port, based on the expected financial and operational benefits of the inland port. Hancock International Airport has the capacity to grow both passenger and cargo service. The investment of $10,000,000 in securing one or more low -cost airlines would have a payback over 5 years, conservatively, of $100,000,000 in reduced fares for business travelers and leisure travelers. This directly supports tourism in a region that is u nderutilized based on the diverse destinations available in the greater CNY area. Additionally, based on the proximity to the proposed inland port, the prospects for securing increased air cargo serviced by a multi- modal operation would enhance the economic development in and around the airport. CNY is well positioned to attract a few, low cost airline to Syracuse Hancock International Airport. With a traditional catchment area that includes more than 1.5 million people, it is the largest airport in the northeast US without service from Frontier, Spirit or Southwest Airlines. Several factors make this airport a prime candidate for network expansion by one or more of these carriers: the Syracuse market's proximity and increased attractiveness to a growing number of Canadian leisure travelers who enjoy significant savings vs. Canadian flights into the US, Syracuse's current ranking as the 27th most expensive large or mid -sized market in the US for air travel, the airport's recent move to an authority governance model which has allowed it to significantly reduce costs. If competitive revenue guarantees were available, Syracuse would have a high probability of success in attracting additional, competitive, low -fare service, saving businesses, tourists and res idents, tens of millions of dollars each year. The Port of Oswego has grown 5 fold in the last 10 years, and has the capacity to continue that growth. The existing connection of limited access highways & interstates, and rail service to the inland port, w ith the airport on the way, makes the CNY area a natural for the expansion of our transportation and logistics assets and capabilities CNY is again in a unique position to leverage the assets of a commercial airport in Syracuse, a military air field and surrounding base in Watertown, extensive \"clear\" flight space over Lake Ontario, and an existing development and manufacturing base for sensor and controls hardware and software, which can be leveraged with NUAIR to incorporate the research and analysis of UAS vehicles for distribution which could be tied into the expanded distribution centers that would develop around the inland port. Jobs in transportation and logistics are expected to grow by 8.7% by 2022, adding 790,000 positions, nationally. Job growth in this sector is not expected to be evenly distributed, geographically. CNY has a strong job presence in this sector, with the highest location quotient (.88) of any region in upstate New York and is a good candidate to benefit from this anticipated job growth due to several factors - uniquely suitable location with geographic and infrastructure advantages, labor costs and skills alignment, growth in regional exports and the opportunity to handle additional imports due to the pending expansion of the Pana ma Canal. Global demand will drive significant increases in aviation relation research, development and manufacturing over the next 20 years. Currently operating at record production levels, the world's leading aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus in creases of 103% and 106% in the global commercial aircraft fleet (passenger and cargo) over the next two decades, producing some 38,000 new aircraft. In addition, the US Federal Aviation Administration projects an CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 69 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Transportation & Logistics | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1increase of more than 22,800 general aviation aircraft (private, corporate, charter) over the same period. This is in addition to projections for exponential growth in the unmanned portion of the aviation sector. Aviation engineering, manufacturing, operations and maintenance will all experienc e increased global demand as a result of this growth. Aviation Centers of Excellence concentrate industry assets and expertise, as well as academic partnerships and training opportunities, in identified focus areas to address this growth. According to th e Bureau of Labor Statistics, New York is home to more than 97,000 aerospace jobs, placing the state in the top - five nationwide. Syracuse is uniquely situated to be home to a statewide Aviation Center of Excellence thanks to its unparalleled combination of assets including, ample airport space, concentration of companies with aerospace expertise, research universities, UAS research and testing, workforce and geography. Strategies, Tactics and Objectives Objective #1: Build CNY as a Multi- Modal Hub for G lobal Logistics Strategy # 1 - Grow CNY's role and share of global importing and exporting by targeting, expanding, and enabling logistics infrastructure, by streamlining services, support, and physical asset interconnectedness Brand CNY as a global access point supporting both US and Canada trade with overseas as well as Central and South American markets. Expand and update capabilities to handle and ship the gamut of commodities from parcel to pallet loads, railcars to containers, and bulk. Support the Inland Port initiative by the Port of Oswego and expand into a multi -modal hub supporting import and export facilities and services, fulfillment capabilities for domestic forwarding, cross -dock support to local industries, and freight consolidation potential. Develop International Air Cargo service at Hancock International Airport that can take advantage of available shovel ready building sites adjacent to the airport, uncongested airspace, a direct route to via I -481 to the Inland Port, and the existing inte rstate highway system Tactics: Survey existing industry in manufacturing and distribution with known involvement in exports and uncover the cost, process, and logistics parameters to produce a detailed understanding of challenges, market breadth, service and both perceived advantages and disadvantages in sourcing and output Determine if companies involved in export have the capacity and capability to deliver on overseas sales. Are they ready to scale for accelerated growth, and have the skills, market presence and cultural understanding to deliver on export orders? Do these companies have the understanding of liquidity and currency exchange risk over the lengthier customer order to payment cycles? Uncover CNY's rail, waterborne, and highway matrix of commodities moving in and out with multimodal interchanges to determine existing infrastructure support and capacity as well as potential and actual bottlenecks to cost and service efficiency. Target NAFTA and BRICs participants as prime marketing prospects for logistics services. Canada, in particular, was the United States largest goods export market (2013 data - Goods CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 70 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Transportation & Logistics A.1export to Canada was $300 BN, goods import was $332 BN). Highlight the I -81 corridor, rail via the Montreal secondary with CSX, and the Port of Oswego for short sea shipping opportunities. Identify carriers' service parameters and gaps by rail, water, air and truck. Solicit and gain cooperation of carriers for investment, expanded capacity, and multi- modal interchange agreements Objective #2: Develop CNY Transportation and Logistics Infrastructure as an Operational Haven from Climate Change and Natural Disaster Strategy #2 - Develop and brand CNY's role and capacity as a critical component of domestic and multinational companies' managemen t of supply chain diversity, safety, and sustainability by capitalizing on lower risk and exposures to climate change and extreme weather events along with site availability, abundant fresh water sources, multiple transportation modes, and close proximity to major domestic markets and import/export corridors Develop a marketing plan that includes both the current science, substance, and support of CNY as predictable safe harbor from extreme weather events, a prime entry corridor with Canada, market access demographics, and logistics infrastructure support. Secure property, options, and commitments that extend the ability of CNY economic developers and commercial realtors to attract Fortune 1000 clients, overseas entities that want to enter US markets, and entrepreneurs expanding into global markets. Tactics: Prepare a comprehensive list of properties in the region including available distribution, vacated industrial sites, brownfield, and ready to build. Prioritize and fast -track for appropriate zoning and land use approvals to shorten approval cycle Invest in spec buildings and land for manufacturing, prioritizing parcels proximate to both high capacity water sources and transportation infrastructure Map supporting industry clusters where CNY already has an advantage to multi- national manufacturing prospects and their procurement requirements. Assuming renewal of the Export -Import Bank's charter by Congress, utilize their resources in helping to expand potential exporters in agricultural and manufacturing sectors, as well as their capabilities to assist in financing and credit arrangements. Extend the CenterState Metropolitan Export Initiative to further expand and integrate assistance to companies wishing to market products and services abroad. Objectiv e #3 : Increase Competition and Reduce Airfares at Syracuse Hancock International Airport Central New York has an opportunity to increase airline competition in the market and attract new low cost carriers, providing fare relief for business and leisure travelers to/from Syracuse. This will, in turn, provide valuable ripple effects for tourism and many industries that depend on air travel to conduct business. Strategy #3 - Make SYR more competitive among mid -sized markets across the US that are vying for m arket -entry from low -cost airlines. Develop and utilize active market intelligence from the business community on needs and opportunities as they relate CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 71 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Transportation & Logistics | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1specifically to business travel and connectivity for global network carriers. Market SYR and/or specific air carrier offerings, as incentives, to increase leisure travel usage among CNY residents, visiting friends and relatives, and the growing Canadian leisure travel market . Tactics Create a $10 million air service development fund to provide incentives such as revenue guarantees for new entrants and new routes from incumbent carriers. Markets across the country have used this approach to develop revenue guarantees and other incentives to quickly attract new service that has a significant impact on both business and leisure travel Organize community air service investment. Develop a program for businesses (such as media, for example) to contribute in -kind services or pledge use of new service (ticket banks, for example) as part of this effort. Engage airlines, currently serving the market and not currently in the market, in direct information and advocacy contact on behalf of airport, the region's business and leisure travelers and tourism -related industries. Expand on prior Fly Syracuse initiatives, and current Visit Syracuse marketing efforts, to increase utilization of Syracuse Hancock International Airport. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 72 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Unmanned Aerial Systems A.1 Upstate Revitalization Initiative Strategic Proposal: Unmanned Aerial Systems Background Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) technology is the next great evolution of civil aviation in America and around the world. UAS will revolutionize how industry and government entities go about accomplishing their daily missions. Applications of the technology are limited only by one's imagination; delive ring mail and freight, transporting people, environmental monitoring, agriculture, media and entertainment, mapping and imagery, disaster management, and law enforcement and public safety, and so on. The Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems Internationa l (AUVSI) study indicates that in America alone, the UAS industry will create more than 100,000 jobs and $82 Billion in economic impact by 2025. The global market will be far larger. The challenge is how to integrate UAS safely into our way of life and e conomy while protecting the public's right to privacy and the quiet enjoyment of their property. Central New York is already leading that movement. The region is the home of world renowned aerospace, sensor, and air traffic management development corporat ions; universities recognized for excellence in aerospace research & development and, public policy and law; one of only six FAA authorized UAS R&D Test Sites, in the nation; and a Department of Defense installation that is home to the 174th Attack Wing op erating MQ -9 Reaper\u00ae unmanned systems worldwide as well as training US and foreign military forces in the system. Local corporations, universities, FAA test site, and defense installation are partnering to develop innovative solutions for flying UAS safely while protecting individual liberties. Approximately 5,000 people are currently employed at these organizations and are working to solve the numerous technical challenges related to safe and secure integration of UAS. The launching pad is prepared, but much more is needed to meet the expected demand for unmanned systems. We need entrepreneurs to develop new UAS applications and businesses; operators and systems to fly them safely; experts to maintain them; air traffic control systems to manage all the traffic; certifications standards and policy that dictate how they integrate into the current airspace; and all the training, logistics, and support equipment to make the systems a safe and accepted part of everyday life increasing the human potential. Central New York, in a 10 -year economic impact study conducted for Northeast UAS Airspace Integration Research Alliance (NUAIR) Hickey and Associates, is characterized as particularly well suited to shape this new industry growth. We just need to light the fuse! The Hickey study predicts a regional Total Money impact of $396 Million Dollars; job growth of 757 new jobs; and $45.5 million in total tax revenue.

These findings emerged from the Issues, Needs, and Opportunity Statements we developed for UAS in the Central New York region. The UAS Industry greatly needs an overarching program, comprised of public and private stake holders, to develop a comprehensive, low altitude, commercial, FAA certified UAS Traffic Management System. This system will be capable of managing a multitude of vehicles for both within and beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) operations. This system will enable the massive economic benefit that AUVSI and others have projected when Integration of UAS into the National Airspace System (NAS) is realized. 23 These numbers did not take into account the Major UAS Industry Shaping Programs proposed in this paper. These programs will radically transform the UAS Industry and make CNY the epicenter of this revolution in aviation. CNY will become the clear destination to locate a UAS company based on the incredibly unique infrastructure and workforce, capabilities, and the most important programs in the UAS Industry being executed here! CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 74 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Unmanned Aerial Systems A.1This system will allow Precision Agriculture to really take off with BVLOS operations and for Amazon, Goo gle and others to make good on the vision of routine product delivery, on a massive scale, to your front door within minutes of an order. A program of this ambition and on this scale will allow the US to take the lead in safely and successfully integrating UAS into the NAS. CNY in uniquely positioned, better than any region in the world, to lead this effort and become the center of excellence for UAS Integration. Central New York has incredibly unique regional assets combined with world leading Avionics/UAS expertise to successfully execute this program: There is a consortium of companies that have helped to create the safest manned Air Traffic Control (ATC) system in the world. These capabilities and expertise will be utilized to build the safest low altit ude traffic management system for UAS. NUAIR - One of Six FAA UAS R&D Test Sites. The Griffiss Test Range will be the only instrumented FAA test site in the nation by the beginning of 2016. Industry, Academic and Government expertise that spans: Airborne and ground sensors Critical detect and avoid algorithms and solutions to solve the BVLOS challenge Certified surveillance and Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems World class manufacturing facilities and capabilities Information and cyber/cybersecurity UAV platforms Spectrum management for UAS networks for communication and control networks A national policy for the use of UAS in the NAS is required that balances safety, national security and personal privacy and can best be developed within the framework of a National Policy Institute charged with developing UAS regulations and policy. Opportunity for New York State to be the leader in UAS policy at a state level and help shape national policy for safe integration of UAS. CNY region has a history of successful working relationships with the FAA for certification of aviation safety systems. This ties in nicely as regulation and policy will be linked to new safety systems the FAA will be certifying to enable safe integration of UAS. The region could form a UAS Policy Institute dedicated to developing UAS regulation and policy. Syracuse University (SU) is home to the top -ranked Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Administration and Newhouse School of Mass Communication, SU has considerable capabilities in the policy and journalism arenas. The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Administration is already involved in policy research directly related to UAS at its Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism, including a project called \"Rise of t he Drones\" exploring the legal issues surrounding UAS, and several active cybersecurity and information assurance research projects. Conservative estimates suggest the creation of thousands of new entry level as well as senior level jobs and many billion s in economic activity for the region that takes the lead in solving the challenges related to integrating UAS into the NAS [from AUVSI Economic Report]: CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 75 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Unmanned Aerial Systems | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1UAS integration into the NAS is expected to have enormous economic and job creation impacts in the Uni ted States. These impacts have been demonstrated to be due to direct, indirect and induced effects of total spending in UAS development. The results of these economic impacts are as follows: During the 11 -year period post integration (assumed 2015 -2025 for report): UAS integration is expected to contribute $82.1 B to the nation's economy 103,776 new jobs will be crated, with 844,741 job years worked over this time period Integration into the NAS will create more than 34,000 manufacturing jobs and more than 70,000 new jobs in the first three years The manufacturing jobs created will be high paying ($40,000) and require technical baccalaureate degrees Every year that integration is delayed, the United States loses more than $10 billion in potential economic impact. This translates to a loss of $27.6 million per day that UAS are not integrated into the NAS. \"While we project more than 100,000 new jobs by 2025, states that create favorable regulatory and business environments for the industry and the technology w ill likely siphon jobs away from states that do not\" [from AUVSI Economic Report]. A critical technology required to safely integrate UAS are reliable detect and avoid systems. These systems will allow UAS to avoid collisions with other aircraft or any ot her object that may be in its flight path . Sensor technology that is capable of accurately and reliably detecting and tracking very small objects at low altitude is essential and a major strength of the CNY region. CNY Region's World Leading Detect and Avo id Expertise: SU: In support of the Detect and Avoid research area, Data/ information fusion is a strong focus area in the College of Engineering and Computer Science at SU. SU also has recognized capabilities in Detection/ tracking/classification of objec ts and events; Situational Activity recognition based on video sensors; Learning theory; Remote sensing and geographic information systems; and Navigation and path planning. SRC / Gryphon Sensors: Lead for the Army's Ground Based Sense and Avoid Program: The LSTAR ground- based sense and avoid radar system allows for the operation of UAS in the NAS without a chase plane or ground observer. SRC/ Gryphon are world leaders in tracking the challenging low (altitude), slow, and small targets in highly cluttered environments. SRC has many fielded, operational systems that are successfully executing these types of tracking missions. SRC also has proven expertise in data fusion from multiple sensors platforms (for a variety of Governm ent customers). Gryphon Sensors is focused on building UAS Integration and Drone Security systems for the large and emerging commercial market. Saab/ Sensis: Integration of UAV platforms into the NAS via ground -based sense and avoid (GBSAA) systems will require the fusion of cooperative surveillance data with primary, non -cooperative surveillance data. Saab Sensis has decades of experience developing, deploying and certifying transponder Multilateration and ADS- B surveillance technologies, and a track record of fusing and integrating that data into the NAS. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 76 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Unmanned Aerial Systems A.1Further evidence that Detect and Avoid (Sense and Avoid) is one of the key technical challenges that needs to be solved to enable BVLOS operations of UAS in the NAS is a recent Science and Research Panel meeting dedicated entirely to Detect and Avoid for low altitude small UAS: CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 77 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Unmanned Aerial Systems | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1 CNY has the world renowned and deep expertise required to lead the development of the critical Detect and Avoid systems that will enable safe integration of UAS into the NAS. The UAS Industry currently lacks a standardized system of testing protocols and certification criteria/procedures to insure that UAS are safe and airworthy. These standards should be developed in collaboration with the FAA and NASA to ensure safety and compliance. The CNY region has the opportunity to become the Center of Excellence for UAS standards development and certification. The region could be the first mover with construction of the first UAS certification facility. Central New York could own and operate a very unique national test and certification asset. National UAS Standards Testing and Ratings (NU- STAR) would be a state of the art certification facility where UAS will be tested and rated before being granted access to fly in the NAS. Comp anies would come to the area to certify their aircraft and system components indoors at the NU -STAR test center, and then work with the NUAIR Test Range for final outdoor flight certification. Industry will be attracted to the CNY region to be part of a unique UAS integration environment where the most important programs in the UAS industry are taking place. The corridor from Syracuse to the NUAIR Griffiss Range will be the home of a UAS Innovation cluster of companies. The UAS industry nationwide (and regionally) does not have an adequate supply of FAA certified pilots, operators, and maintenance technicians to meet the demand, once UAS are integrated for BVLOS commercial operations in the NAS. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 78 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Unmanned Aerial Systems A.1CNY can leverage its unique assets to create industry leading training programs. The numerous esteemed academic institutions coupled with the 174th Fighter Wing schoolhouse and NUAIR can develop the training and certification programs required to meet the UAS Industry's need for certified pilots, technicians and trainers. Training programs will also be needed for the many new jobs that will be created at the NU-STAR test and certification facility. The UAS Industry has a strong need for advanced, lightweight airborne payload sensors of virtually all types. These sens ors must be developed, certified and commercially fielded using the latest in conventional and Nano scale technology. CNY can leverage investment and expertise of many local aviation companies to become a major player in this critical area. Lockheed Martin has several nano -technology corporate investments in this space SRC is investing in advanced technologies enabling next generation light weight, low cost airborne Detect and Avoid radars Data links and communications for UAS will increasi ngly be subject to potential cyberattacks and / or interference . There is a major need for a secure, reliable, certified communications framework that can cooperate with all equipment in the National Air Space. The UAS Industry will need to perform studies to determine the appropriate datalinks for cooperative messaging as well as the control of UAS in this new UAS Traffic Management System. There is also a need for creating of a cyber- security infrastructure to protect the data and communication links. There is a great opportunity for the CNY region to lead these highly needed research programs to determine viable datalinks and associated frequencies for monitoring and controlling UAS. These studies could then be followed by design and production of low cost cooperative sensors and the network infrastructure for communication and control of UAS. CNY Universities and Industry have renowned expertise in spectrum management that could be furthered to take a leadership position in UAS datalinks within this new U AS traffic management system. CNY can take the lead in developing the cyber security infrastructure for this new UAS traffic management system. CNY has core expertise and credentials in the cyber area that can be leveraged for this effort. There is an imm ediate and evolving need for local communities to have the ability to protect critical infrastructure and highly populated areas from the threat of rogue UAS. As UAS Integration moves closer to reality, it is a foregone conclusion that a homeland security system that can reliably detect and track all UAS traffic is essential for protecting people and critical infrastructure from the threat of a rogue UAS. In the New York TRACON area (5 airports) there have been 1,300 reported UAS incursion near airports in the past year. This is just what has been visually seen and reported. This is a major opportunity for the CNY Region who is home to companies and technologies that are the best in the world at UAS Detection and Drone Security for the US Government. This te chnology will be leveraged in development of this much needed UAS traffic management system (see finding 1). That system in turn will also be CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 79 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Unmanned Aerial Systems | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1incredibly useful for homeland security as it will account for \"all\" air traffic (not just cooperative, but also n on-cooperatives) in the airspace. Knowing and controlling the position of all UAS traffic will alleviate safety and privacy concerns from rogue UAS. Strategies, Tactics and Objectives Objective 1: By 2021, clearly establish CNY as the world renowned Epicenter of UAS Innovation, making CNY the most important region in the world for the massively growing and emerging UAS Industry.

Urban cores serve as the backbone of our communities by providing a diversity of housing options, historically significant architecture, and walkable, mixed -use neighborhoods. From mid -sized cities to rural villages, Central New York's main streets and neighborhood business districts are the educational, cultural, commerc ial, civic, and employment centers of the region. Strong regions are built around strong urban cores that preserve and invest in the human, social, and physical infrastructure required for industry to compete and grow. As the millennial generation reverses a half-century of out migration and disinvestment by flocking to urban cores to take advantage of the connectivity and convenience inherent within them, the Central New York region is uniquely positioned to benefit from this emerging trend 24. Central New York's urban cores are home to many of the area's largest employers, as evidenced by our region's rank of sixth in jobs density among the top 100 metropolitan areas 25. Our urban cores also contain some of the region's fastest growing census tracts. Downtown Syracuse, for example, has experienced a 47 percent increase in population over the past decade and currently boasts a 99 percent residential occupancy rate 26. Central New York communities are increasingly at the leading edge in implementing innovative urban redevelopment strategies through creative public private partnerships. These partnerships are leveraging significant private and institutional investment with the use of progressive state and federal incentives like the New York Main Street, historic rehabilitation and brownfield tax credit programs, and innovative policy solutions like the New York State Land Bank Act. The renaissance underway in our re gion's cores is evident from the main streets of Auburn, Oswego, Cortland, and Oneida, to the inner -ring neighborhoods on Syracuse's near west and near north sides. New mixed -use communities are also emerging, particularly around our region's waterfronts as we reclaim our civic waterways. Moving forward, the Central New York region must leverage and connect these recent investments to ensure long term sustainability and growth. New York State is considering making an unprecedented investment in the Centra l New York region, and by investing in our urban cores and main streets we are ensuring the highest rate of return to the taxpayers. In Onondaga County, for example, while the City of Syracuse takes up only 2.7 percent of the total land area, it accounts for 16.2% of the County's overall property tax production. Downtown Syracuse alone takes up only .13 percent of the County's land area yet produces 7.6 percent of the County's retail sales taxes. The positive correlation between density and revenue is not unique to 24 Nielsen, Millennials Prefer Cities to Suburbs, Subways to Driveways (March 2014) 25 Brookings, Job Sprawl Revisited (April 2009) 26 Kevin Tampone , \"Downtown Syracuse's residential growth is part of a national trend\" Syracuse.com, October 22, 2014 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 83 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Urban Core Revitalization | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1Syracuse, and is present throughout our region's urban cores from Oswego and Fulton, to Auburn, Oneida and Cortland. Businesses and industries interested in attracting and retaining the best and brightest talent are well served by doing so in Central New York, because it is in our urban cores where talent can find the activity and dynamic lifestyle they seek. Every community in our region contains a main street or neighborhood business district that serves as its core and by applying a series of strategic investment principles to their future development, the Central New York region is poised to thrive.

According to a recent report from Consensus CNY: Onondaga County consists of thirty -six general purpose local governments serving approximately 468,000 residents. 27 Brookings, How big (or small) is your city's middle class? (June 9, 2015) CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 85 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Urban Core Revitalization | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1From 2003 to 2013, the total cost of local government across Onondaga County increased by approximately 34 percent. In July 2012, data reported by the Tax Foundation ranked Onondaga County 70th (of 806 counties nationwide) in property taxes as a percent o f median household income and 14th in property taxes as a percent of home value. More than 69 percent of Onondaga County residents leave their \"home\" community to travel to work. According to the Syracuse Metropolitan Transportation Council (SMTC): While the average commute time in the region (21.6 minutes) is 10 minutes less than the state average and 4 minutes less the national average, the average commute time for the majority of City of Syracuse residents that use public transportation is more than 30 minutes. While 80% of Onondaga County's disadvantaged population is proximate to the Centro service area, in Cayuga and Oswego Counties the proximity drops significantly to 54% and 42%, respectively. Madison and Cortland have very limited public transpor tation options that are not connected to Centro. The following map produced by the Urban Institute illustrates the income disparities in Onondaga County. The wealthiest 10% live in the areas depicted in blue and the poorest 10% live in areas depicted in grey. The region's anchor institutions are the area's major employers. They import highly educated talent, represent massive purchasing power and are primarily located within the area's urban CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 86 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Urban Core Revitalization A.1cores. By leveraging the region's place -based anchor institution expertise, Central New York can reduce concentrated poverty, and build community wealth within its cities and villages. According a June 2011 report from the Initiative for a Competitive Inner City: Colleges and universities in the United States have urban core real estate portfolios valued at almost $100 billion. In 2008, urban core anchors spent over $200 billion on goods, services and pay, with large hospitals accounting for $130 billion alone. While higher education and medical institutions provide 5.2% of the jobs nationwide, their impact more than doubles in urban cores where they provide 11% of the jobs. Approximately 340,000 jobs are expected to be created within urban cores over the next eight years as industry clusters like Local Health Servi ces and Education and Knowledge Creation, which are directly connected to institutions of higher education and medicine, continue to grow. The industrial legacy of the region's urban cores, characterized by population and job loss combined with real and perceived environmental contamination (ex. brownfields), has severely limited the region's ability to connect existing assets by reinvesting in its aging building stock, infrastructure, and vacant and abandoned properties. The City of Syracuse had a record 391 water main breaks in 2014. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the City lost almost 2000 paying water customers over the past decade. Based on information obtained from developer interviews, historic rehabilitation projects in the region with total project costs less than $5 million are having trouble attracting historic tax credit equity investors due to high transactional costs. Based on information obtained from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, approximately $1.1 billion in New York State Brownfield Redevelopment tax credits is associated with approximately $7.6 billion in invested capital since the financial start of the Brownfield Cleanup Program in tax year 2007 through tax year 2013, demonstrating that State Brownf ield projects have the ability to leverage significant outside investment relative to state investment. Review of the NYSDEC's Remedial Site Database indicates: There were 827 State BCP sites statewide as of June 2015. There are 50 BCP sites within the CNY REDC's footprint, and a large majority of those sites (46) are located in Onondaga County. Madison and Cortland Counties have no BCP sites and Oswego and Cayuga Counties have only two BCP sites each. The City of Cortland alone has identified 26 brownfi elds or suspected brownfields. Most BCP sites in the State are located in either western New York (NYSDEC Regions 8 and 9 have 29% of BCP sites) or downstate (NYSDEC Regions 1, 2, and 3 have 58% of BCP sites). None of the 12 Brownfield Opportunity Areas (BOAs) recently designated by the NYS Department of State in April 2015 are located within the Central New York Region. According to the US Census 2013 American Community Survey 5 -year estimates: CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 87 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Urban Core Revitalization | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.143% of the housing stock in Madison County's villages was bu ilt before 1939. This number rises to 44% in Syracuse, 56.8% in Cortland, 56.6% Auburn, and 56.2% in Oswego. There are 17,483 \"other\" vacant units in the five county Central New York region (not counting properties that are vacant for sale, for rent, et c.). Aging infrastructure and the lack of physical, programmatic and broadband connectivity between existing economic anchors and assets throughout the region's urban cores is limiting economic growth. The City of Syracuse had a record 391 water main breaks in 2014. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the City lost almost 2000 paying water customers over the past decade, primarily as a result of population loss and suburban sprawl. 28 Through a series of stakeholder interviews the issue of connec tivity, or lack thereof, between our region's existing economic assets emerged as a reoccurring theme. Examples included better connecting the region's waterfront assets (ex. Syracuse Inner Harbor, Onondaga Lake, Port of Oswego, Erie Canal, Tioughnioga Ri ver, etc...), as well as emerging developments in the City of Syracuse's Lakefront, Downtown, and University Hill neighborhoods. Examples of connectivity identified by stakeholders included, but were not limited to infill development, transit, broadband, and other critical infrastructure (water, sewer, roads, etc...). Central New York's urban cores have an abundance of unique and authentic arts and cultural organizations that serve as an economic engine for the region. To further leverage and enhance this economic engine these organizations are in need of enhanced programmatic and operational connectivity and more sustainable funding mechanisms. According to the Arts & Economic Prosperity IV Study, project of Americans for the Arts and LeMoyne College: Arts and culture is a $133.4 million industry in the Greater Syracuse area alone. The industry supports 5117 full -time equivalent jobs and generates $20.1 million in local and state tax revenue. Nonprofit arts and culture organizations spend $33.9 million each year and leverage $99.5 million in additional spending by arts and culture audiences. In the City of Auburn alone arts and culture organizations spend almost $2 million each year and leverage another $1.7 million in additional spending by audiences. Mor e than a quarter of the audiences for arts and culture events in the Greater Syracuse area came from out of town, thereby bolstering cultural tourism. The following are results from a CNY Arts survey conducted as part of their ENGAGE regional assessment: 28 Teri Weaver , \" Miner keeps Syracuse water rates level for 5th year while asking NY, Washington to fix pipes\" Syracuse.com, April 15, 2015 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 88 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Urban Core Revitalization A.1 Strategies, Tactics and Objectives Objective #1: Increase urban core high school graduation rates by 25% over the next five years. Central New York's urban cores are disproportionately segregated, both economically and socially. Antiquated government, education, workforce development, and transportation systems throughout the region are key contributors to this problem. Objective #2: Attract 1000 new jobs to the region's urban cores over the next three years. The region's anchor institutions are the area's major employers. They import highly educated talent, represent massive purchasing power and are primarily located within the area's urban cores. These anchor institutions play a significant role in sustaining small business growth and the development of microenterprises through start -up capital and investments, talent attraction and retention, and supplier contracting. Objective #3: By 2020 80% of the region's anchor institutions will be sharing best practices and implementing and measurin g the results of place -based strategies that increase local hiring and purchasing, retain graduates, and engage faculty, doctors and other professionals in urban life. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 89 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Urban Core Revitalization | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1The industrial legacy of the region's urban cores, characterized by population and job l oss, has severely limited the region's ability to grow its economy. Aging and abandoned building stock, vacant properties, and the real and perceived environmental contamination of properties (i.e. brownfields) are among the most pressing challenges and t he region is not sufficiently leveraging existing resources to effectively address them. Objective #4 : Reduce vacant properties and brownfields in urban cores by 25% over the next five years. Aging infrastructure and the lack of physical, programmatic and broadband connectivity between existing economic anchors and assets throughout the region's urban cores is limiting economic growth. Objective #5: Develop the fastest and most affordable broadband network in the state over the next ten years. Central New York's urban cores have an abundance of unique and authentic arts and cultural organizations that serve as an economic engine for the region. To further leverage and enhance this economic engine these organizations are in need of enhanced programmatic and operational connectivity and more sustainable funding mechanisms. Finding #1: Central New York's urban cores are disproportionately segregated, both economically and socially. Antiquated government, education, workforce development, and transportatio n systems throughout the region are key contributors to this problem. Strategy # 1 - Develop more mixed income housing projects and neighborhoods in the region's urban cores. Tactics Revise existing state and local incentive programs to support mixed income and mixed use development, and where appropriate, develop new programs to accomplish the same. Create the first program in the nation that provides students attending college in the region with incentives to purchase, renovate, and manage land bank owned properties and use the sales proceeds, three years after graduation, to reduce their college debt. Acquire and renovate mixed- use properties within areas of concentrated poverty in the region's urban cores and award the resulting live/work units to graduates of entrepreneurial boot camps and winners of local business plan competitions. Awardees would pay the cost of utilities and maintenance only for the first three years. Strateg y #2 - Drive stronger access to job opportunities by locating employers in urban cores. Tactics Develop priority shovel ready sites in each of the region's urban cores by proactively addressing predevelopment impediments and expediting the municipal approv al processes. Incentivize the relocation of businesses to the urban core. Enhance connections between urban core employers and job seekers by expanding the dual client workforce development model currently being piloted by the Work Train Collaborative.

Tactics Expand bike and pedestrian infrastructure throughout the region's urban cores. Support transit oriented development around existing and future transit hubs. Conduct infrastructure reuse studies for existing underutilized transportation assets in urban cores for the purpose of creating specialized rail travel ( i.e. OnTrack); rails and trails pathways and elevated parkways ( i.e. The Highline). Strategy #4 - Support and expand efforts to dramatically improve early childhood and high school education in urban cores. Tactics Fully fund the Say Yes to Education Syracuse scholarship endowment and expand Say Yes programming to other urban cores in the region. Support and expand the Early Childhood Alliance of Onondaga County into other urban cores in the region. Finding #2: The region's anchor institutions are the area's major employers . They import highly educated talent, represent m assive purchasing power and are primarily located within the area's urban cores. These anchor institutions play a significant role in sustaining small business growth and the development of microenterprises through start -up capital and investments, talent attraction and retention, and supplier contracting. Strategy #5 - Organize the region's urban anchor institutions into a collaborative, similar to those in Minneapolis and Chicago, for the purpose of developing strategies that simultaneously improve the r egion's urban cores and the strength and resiliency of their institutions . Tactics Bring in the nation's top experts (UPenn, University Hospitals of Cleveland, etc ...) to conduct three C -level Roundtables for the CEO's of the region's hospitals and institutions of higher education focusing on the benefits to their institutions of undertaking place making, employment, and purchasing programs with their communities. Create teams that cut across regional anchor institutions to develop mutually beneficial programs and partner with a national research organization (ex. Initiative for a Competitive Inner City) to develop a dashboard to measure impact. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 91 CNY RISING | APPENDICES Urban Core Revitalization | WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS A.1Strategy # 6 - Estab lish new partnerships between anchor institutions, small businesses, and nonprofits in their surrounding communities to create new economic opportunities. Engage new urban core anchor institutions in the Work Train Collaborative to both fill existing institutional employment opportunities , as well as to better align curriculum to current industry trends and emerging opportunities. Create a streamlined process for contractors and local businesses to submit bids and proposals for services needed by anchor institutions. Strengthen and incentivize university industry partnerships to increase technology commercialization and catalyze entrepreneurial activity in the region's urban cores. Create \"Downtown Design Centers\" that bring together the region's manufacturers with the region's academic and professional design talent to assist local companies with design challenges, product reinvention, safety and disposal , materials innovation and more. Finding #3: The industrial legacy of the region's urban cores , characterized by population and job loss, has severely limited the region's ability to grow its economy . Aging and abandoned building stock, vacant properties, and the real and perceived environmental contamination of properties (i.e. brownfields) are among the most pressing challenges and the region is not sufficiently leveraging existing resources to effectively address them. Strategy #7 - Drive the adaptive reuse of the region's aging building stock and vacant properties. Tactics Create an historic t ax credit equity revolving loan fund with matching public and private funds. Establish an urban core revitalization fund to support the mixed -use, transit oriented redevelopment of the region's main streets and neighborhood business districts, as well as t he stabilization of at -risk urban core neighborhoods through strategic interventions (ex. rehabilitation, demolition/deconstruction, infill, parking, public space, etc...). Build the capacity of the Greater Syracuse Land Bank and/or explore the creation of new land banks to comprehensively address the region's vacant property issues. Strategy #8 - Expand implementation of federal and state Brownfield Cleanup Programs and the state Environmental Restoration Program to attract private sources of capital. Tactics Encourage municipalities and nonprofit corporations to assess existing economic and environmental conditions in their urban cores using a corridor, neighborhood, or other area- wide approach. Build a shared community vision and consensus on brownfield redevelopment approaches and priorities in the region's urban cores through public private partnerships and locally driven planning processes. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 92 CNY RISING | APPENDICES WORK GROUP STRATEGIC PROPOSALS | Urban Core Revitalization A.1 Finding #4: Aging infrastructure and the lack of physical, programmatic and broadband connectivity between existing economic anchors and assets throughout the region's urban cores is limiting economic growth. Strategy #9 - Prioritize and proactively invest in strategic infrastructure. Tactics Use GIS mapping data to be more proactive with infrastructure invest ments. Develop and adopt dig once policies throughout the region. Strategy #10 - Enhance connections to existing economic assets through innovation and technology. Tactics Build out new broadband infrastructure through public private partnerships. Establish innovation districts in each of the region's urban cores. Finding #5: Central New York's urban cores have an abundance of unique and authentic arts and cultural organizations that serve as an economic engine for the region. To further leverage and enhance this economic engine these organizations are in need of enhanced programmatic and operational connectivity and more sustainable funding mechanisms. Strategy #11 - Build the capacity and resources for CNY Arts, the regional arts council, to lead the region through a transformational districting project that will establish partnerships at both the national and local level to enhance connections between arts and culture organizations and the community. Tactics Partner with a national expert on creative place making through the arts (ex. ArtPlace, Knight Foundation, etc...) to develop a program that supports innovative partnerships between local residents and arts organizations based on their ability to effectively address community goals and objectives (ex. blight reduction, diversity and inclusion, etc...) through art. Strategy #12 - Increase customers and associated revenue generating opportunities within key urban core arts institutions. Tactics Establish arts and entertainment districts and use creativ e place making to help spur neighborhood revitalization, generate greater use of public spaces, improve vibrancy in downtown and main street districts and facilitate more and better communication between disparate audiences.

These realities have created new competi-tive dynamics that now demand new interventions. The imperative we face is to carefully craft strategies to transform our unique strengths into globally competitive assets. The centerState Agenda for Economic Opportunity responds to that imperative. Steeped in extensive data analysis, it reflects more than two years of work. It drew from the engagement of hun-dreds of stakeholders across the region as well as national experts. Anchored in the commitment to grow opportunity across the entire twelve-county region, together we designed a comprehensive, strategic approach to make the most of our opportunities and address our challenges. centerState cEO convened leading institutions from the public, private, and non-profit sectors to guide development of the Agenda for Economic Opportunity. A steering committee composed of representa-tives from business, government, philanthropy, and education worked in collaboration with the Brookings Institution Metropolitan Policy Program and RW ventures as part of a national pilot. Battelle Technology Partnership Practice provided extensive assistance, along with KS&R, which expanded input from regional stakeholders through an interactive on-line forum. The work proceeded in tandem with the New york State Regional Economic Development councils. It drew extensively from the unprecedented public input and planning by the central New york, Southern Tier, North country, Finger Lakes, and Mohawk valley Regional Economic Development areas, all of which include some counties in the region. We are grateful to all of our partners for the time, resources, and insights they provided. But publica- tion of the Agenda marks only a beginning as it inaugurates a new approach to economic development and a new way of doing business centered on closer coordination and collaboration across the region. It is intended as a living document that will grow and change as new partners become engaged and new oppor-tunities and challenges arise. It will only gain traction with the support of citizens and leaders, however. As a region, we must continue to think through the value proposition we offer to the global market. We need the involvement of many more citizens and organizations to carry out the strategies presented here and to expand their reach to push the region forward in the transition to its next economy. We invite you to join with us. a message from the c enters tate new York r egioncenterstate new York agenda for economic opportunitY CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 97 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CenterState Agenda for Economic Opportunity | METROPOLITAN BUSINESS PLAN B.1Brookings metropolitan polic Y program 2introduction Global economic forces buffeted central Upstate New york over the closing decades of the last century, eroding its tra-ditional industrial base and economic vitality. For more than a decade, regional partners have worked collaboratively to strengthen the region's knowledge assets and define a new economic profile for the new century. Today, the region is in transition. Investments to spur entrepreneurial activity have generated new energy and opened new pathways. cities and town centers are seeing new vibrancy, and universities and other anchor institutions are investing to attract knowledge workers and firms. Local government lead-ers are testing new approaches to gain efficiency and cost effectiveness. Building on that momentum, the Agenda for Economic Opportunity charts a next phase in the work to further the region's economic transforma-tion and establish a new center of gravity for the next economy. The region possesses significant assets for that purpose: emerging and established technology sec-tors, enhanced infrastructure for innovation, expand-ing entrepreneurial networks, and an extraordinary network of 35 colleges and universities that give the region one of the highest concentrations of college students in the nation. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 98 CNY RISING | APPENDICES METROPOLITAN BUSINESS PLAN | CenterState Agenda for Economic Opportunity B.1centerstate new Y ork agenda for economic opportunitY 3centers tate new York is a 12-countY region that includes the sY racuse, ithaca, u tica/r ome, and w atertown metropolitan areas. Treated as one region, it equates to the 55th largest region in the country, home to 1.5 million people, with total employment of just over 650,000 and economic output of $62.9 billion in 2012. At one time, the region's natural resources pro- vided the foundation for its economy, advanced in the early 19 th century by the Erie canal and growing demand for its products up and down the Eastern Seaboard. The Syracuse area became a great manu-facturing center, attracting major firms and large pro-duction plants. Ithaca grew around cornell University; Utica/Rome became a center for U.S. Air Force opera-tions and research. Farmland and the waterways of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River defined Watertown and the North country. It was a region of educators, farmers, and makers, with original equipment manufacturers providing business and civic leadership. Over the last decades of the 20 th century, new service sectors grew up, but many large manufacturers closed production plants or left the region. That decline continued through the decade of the Great Recession, when another 40 percent of its manufacturing base decamped. Decades of de-industrialization left a region of older cities, small towns, and rural communities char-acterized by low wages, long-term unemployment, hollowed out urban neighborhoods, and obsolete industrial land and buildings. Since the beginning of this century, total economic output in the region increased 11.8 percent, well below the national aver-age of 19.7 percent. The region's productivity\u2014or out-put per job\u2014of $91,105 is rising but registers slightly below the national average of $96,024. Productivity in the Syracuse region is notably higher than the national average, however, at $102,900. Employment in the region did not fall as drastically during the Great Recession as it did nationally, but it dipped again over the last year. And the average wage of $39,660 is almost 20 percent lower than the national average. Poverty rates in some areas have risen signifi- cantly with high concentrations in both urban and rural areas. In the city of Syracuse, 38 percent of residents live below the poverty line, among the high-est concentrations of poverty in the country. Beneath those troubling indicators lie others that hold more promise: the potential for a next economy and renewed competitive strength based on capaci-ties in regional firms that have emerged from legacy manufacturing sectors and defense research. n CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 99 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CenterState Agenda for Economic Opportunity | METROPOLITAN BUSINESS PLAN B.1Brookings metropolitan polic Y program 4the c enters tate region l ags the n ation in m ost critical indicators of e conomic p erformance 25.0% 20.0%15.0%10.0% 5.0%0.0% -5.0% 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012United States -0.8% 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 $100 $95 $90$85$80$75United States $96.24 CenterState, NY $91.15 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 $55 $50$45$40$35$30United States $49.20 CenterState, NY $39.66 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 20121. change in e conomic o utput, 2000-2012 compared to national average 3. change in o utput per w orker, 2000-2012 compared to national average 2. change in e mplo Yment, 2000-2012 compared to national average 4. change in h ousehold income, 2000-2012 compared to national average Source: Brookings analysis of Moody's Analytics, U.S. Census, and American Community Survey data CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 100 CNY RISING | APPENDICES METROPOLITAN BUSINESS PLAN | CenterState Agenda for Economic Opportunity B.1centerstate new Y ork agenda for economic opportunitY 5the n ext e conomY A fundamental transformation is underway in the global econ-omy, where knowledge assets centered in people and tech-nology are prized and concentrated in metropolitan areas. The rise of technology, innovation, and globalization are changing the dynamics of productivity and economic growth. Market dynamics are more fluid and geared to reward continuous innovation in products, production techniques, and business models. PHOTO cOURTESy OF: cc EO CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 101 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CenterState Agenda for Economic Opportunity | METROPOLITAN BUSINESS PLAN B.1Brookings metropolitan polic Y program 6 The global economy is rapidly evolving toward even greater integration as well, with goods, services, talent, capital, and supplier relationships seamlessly crossing national boundaries. Metropolitan regions have emerged as the vital hubs of these activities, the engines and essential units of the new economy. This more dynamic environment demands a new approach to economic development: one that is anchored in a deep understanding of the region's market assets and challenges, focused on carefully calibrated strategies built on strengths and designed to foster a culture of collaboration between public and private sector institutions and leaders. Regions with the greatest capacity to think strategi- cally, act globally, and build on their unique strengths will forge ahead in this new environment. Those that don't will fall further behind. esta Blishing a n e w center of g ravitY This new reality shaped the Agenda for Economic Op-portunity developed through the metropolitan busi-ness planning process. It is a business plan in the best sense of the term: Objective and based on rigorous data analysis, it evaluates the region's strengths and weaknesses along five mutually reinforcing market levers that, when aligned, drive productivity and prosperity. Among the five market levers, the region's eco- nomic clusters, or concentrations of related indus-tries, and the quality and effective deployment of its human capital, along with its capacity for innovation, impact the productivity of firms directly. The quality of government and civic governance\u2014the cross-sector networks that enable economic activity\u2014along with the built environment and the region's physical form create underlying conditions that support or hamper growth. The long-term strategic actions proposed in the Agenda for Economic Opportunity represent tangible steps designed to build momentum and synergy to enhance those capacities in the region. It is grounded in market realities and confronts head-on the chal-lenges facing the region. It recommends eight inte-grated strategies and three ambitious initiatives as a first wave of implementation.Additionally, the agenda is committed to inclusive growth and the expansion of opportunity to all parts of the region, recognizing that, in a metropolitan economy, the prosperity of all communities and populations is inextricably linked. Reversing the impact of long-term job losses, low growth rates, and rising poverty is not only a matter of equity: inclusive growth is good for business. Regions that develop and deploy more of their total human capital, land, and production assets do better in the long run than those that do not. For more than a century, centerState New york represented a production center fueled and driven by innovative entrepreneurs and skilled workers who created and built the legacy industries for which it became known. Its challenge going forward is to re-create an ecosystem that is as supportive of new entrepreneurial energy and innovation but focused on 21st century industries, technologies, and skills. The region's current industry profile encompasses thirteen sectors identified as pivotal to its economic health and prospects. Accounting for a third of all employment, eight of those sectors are more highly concentrated in the region than across the country. Six are in manufacturing, which are tradable sectors (those that bring outside resources into the region rather than serving only local markets) and exert strong multiplier effects throughout the economy. Those include biomedical, clean technology, digital and electronic devices, metals production and manu-facturing, packaging, and precision metalworking. The region's best promise for the future lies beyond those traditional industry classifications, however. At the points of intersection between its technology, production, human capital and innovation capacities lies the potential to establish a new center of gravity in emerging markets and new products. n PHOTO cOURTESy OF: JEFF KULIKOWSKI CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 102 CNY RISING | APPENDICES METROPOLITAN BUSINESS PLAN | CenterState Agenda for Economic Opportunity B.1centerstate new Y ork agenda for economic opportunitY 7k e Y f indings: Extensive market analysis conducted over the last two years produced key findings with clear implications for redefining the region's economic profile for the knowledge economy.

It also crystallized points of weakness and challenges that the region must confront in order to establish that new economic pro-file. The full market analysis that produced the Agenda for Economic Opportunity can be read at www.centerstateopportunity.com Key findings critical to shaping the Agenda for Economic Opportunity include: k e Y f inding: the r egion h olds s trong potential to e xcel in n e w technolog Y fields 'Data to Decisions' o ffers a Platform to e stablish a Globally comP etitive n iche in raPiD ly DeveloP inG f ielDs From across several of the region's most prominent industry concentrations, at least 50 technology com-panies create and build systems or components for an emerging field identified as \"Data to Decisions,\" or D2D. Along with cutting-edge researchers in the region's universities and labs, D2D firms share expertise in a variety of fields involved in the processing of massive flows of information to manage increasingly com-plex systems in real time. They possess world-class capabilities in sensing technology, signal processing, cybersecurity, systems integration and engineering, data mining, and decision support. This group of firms employs more than 9,000 work- ers, and overlaps with closely related sectors which currently use and offer opportunities for dramatically expanding markets for this potential global special-ization in D2D technologies. Those sectors include digital electronics primarily in defense and aerospace applications, equipment to monitor and control energy use and environmental quality in buildings, diagnostic and remote monitoring technology for healthcare, and information technology for data man-agement, analysis, transmission, and security. Sectors that have D2D components represent a highly innovative part of the centerState economy, accounting for nearly half of all patents generated in the region in recent years, including many that have emerged from the United States Air Force Research Laboratory in Rome, which is a powerhouse of enormous importance for the region. Major universi-ties also play an active role in development of this specialized knowledge, particularly cornell, Syracuse, CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 103 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CenterState Agenda for Economic Opportunity | METROPOLITAN BUSINESS PLAN B.1Brookings metropolitan polic Y program 8and clarkson whose faculties are leading regional generators of D2D intellectual property, indicating strong potential for new ventures based on cutting-edge research. Building on these capabilities, D2D represents an exciting platform upon which to establish a globally competitive niche for the region in market sectors that are growing and expanding rapidly. The potential impact of that specialized niche goes beyond the D2D cluster itself with the prospect that building world-class capacity in D2D applications will strengthen the competitive positions of four larger clusters that D2D serves: digital electronics, informa-tion systems, medical equipment and applications, and environmental products. Developing this platform requires a multi-pronged approach to fuel innovation and growth in the D2D cluster, particularly the formation of new partnerships to adapt technologies and product to new markets across sectors. It requires complementary action to strengthen the involvement of the region's research centers to build overall capacity for innovation and simultaneously build a competitive workforce in these fields. risinG DemanD o ffers oPPortunities for t arGeteD technoloG y sectors Among tradable sectors in the region's top concen-trations, three in particular are experiencing rising global demand and new market opportunities. Two of them\u2014thermal and environmental control systems and cybersecurity\u2014overlap with the D2D cluster. The region must also recognize ongoing investment in computer chip manufacturing and R&D facilities in the town of Marcy and at cornell University. Many of the 40 firms that make up the thermal and environmental control systems cluster trace their roots to the carrier corporation. They occupy a wide variety of specialty niches related to heating and cool-ing, water filtration, and commercial and residential control systems\u2014all fields that are seeing significant market growth and offer opportunities for the region. Another small but significant cluster centers on the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, working pri-marily with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab in Rome. The challenge for those firms is to move beyond defense contracting to enter the private market, which is expected to double by 2017. In another key area, rising global demand for food and energy offers opportunities for growth in the region's strong biosciences sectors, with implications for agriculture and natural resources. The recent boom in the dairy industry that created thousands of jobs in the production of yogurt illustrates the poten-tial in new agricultural techniques and products. k e Y f inding: the g rowth in g loB a l markets c an Boost the region's e xports and g loB a l fluenc Y While many of the centerState region's economic strengths are rooted in major multi-nationals and globally competitive firms, as they relocated produc-tion away from the region global market orientation waned. In an increasingly global economy, and with consumption expected to more than double in emerg-ing markets by 2025, the centerState region must become more \"globally fluent.\" currently, the region exports approximately $8.7 billion annually to international markets with firms in emerging technology sectors playing signifi-cant roles. But that total represents only 11.5 percent of the region's total economic output. The region must boost its orientation to international markets and ramp up exports. Many of the region's most significant technology sectors and clusters present compelling opportuni-ties for expanding the region's global reach.

On another front, not all parts of the region are attracting foreign-born workers at adequate levels, or retaining the international talent that earns degrees in the region's universities. k e Y f inding: the r egion's i nnovation ecos Ystem i s still emerging and r equires n e w investment The region's investments over the last decade to renew its entrepreneurial ecosystem catalyzed more than a hundred companies now involved in its networks and a growing base of entrepreneurs and startup firms. Through these programs the region is identifying small businesses with high growth poten-tial and connecting them to the resources they need to grow and stay within the region. Those investments represent only a down payment on the long-term strategy to rebuild the region's inno-vation capacity. The next stage requires new vehicles for investment in companies with significant poten-tial to support their sustained contribution to the centerState economy, as well as strengthening other aspects of the innovation ecosystem. A snapshot of the Syracuse region shows that the rate of new business formation still lags behind national averages for larger metropolitan regions. venture capital flow into the region averaged $27 per capita over the last decade compared to $933 per capita in larger regions. Between 2005 and 2008, firms in the region attracted a cumulative total of only 0.1 percent of the $2.8 billion invested annually by venture capital firms located in New york State, prompting a series of studies that have described the region as a venture capital desert. The region boasts an exceptional research base in its universities and institutes with $600 million in annual funding, plus $800 million through the Rome Air Force Lab. Further, industries in the Syracuse region appear to be investing in research and develop-ment, indicating that closer alignment between firms and the region's research institutes could generate greater economic impact. k e Y f inding: the r egion m ust r etain and e xpand a s killed workforce to g row e conomic opportunitY The centerState region is a strong talent generator with its exceptional concentration of colleges and universities enrolling approximately 140,000 students and awarding thousands of degrees each year. y et one of the region's greatest challenges lies in meeting the need for higher-skilled workers for the knowledge economy. Disruptions in the region's labor markets over sev- eral decades created long-term unemployment and limited opportunities for many workers. As a result, the regional workforce today is both older than the national average and actually smaller than it was five years ago, dropping from slightly above 720,000 five years ago to just over 700,000.entrepreneurial n etworks and p rograms: Syracuse Student Sandbox Emerging Business competition Startup Weekend Startup Labs Grants for Growth Tech Garden Syracuse center of Excellence cNy Biotech Accelerator Rehs center for Entrepreneurship at clarkson University Thrive Incubator at SUNy Oswego cayuga venture Fund EDGEcellerator Shipley center for Innovation at clarkson University CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 105 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CenterState Agenda for Economic Opportunity | METROPOLITAN BUSINESS PLAN B.1Brookings metropolitan polic Y program 10Education levels in the region remained virtu- ally unchanged during those years, with high school attainment rates above the national norm but college attainment slightly below the national average. The presence of so many college and university students complicates an accurate assessment of education levels and skills in the workforce, but what is known is that between 2006 and 2010, the region experienced a net annual reduction in the number of residents with graduate degrees, resulting in the loss of nearly 3,600 potential higher-skilled workers. The skills gap spans the full spectrum\u2014from the challenge of recruiting and retaining the most highly educated workers, to shifting demand for \"middle skill\" workers, to effective entry and re-entry portals for workers struggling to gain a toehold in the new economy. National estimates are that half of all new jobs over this decade will require middle skills\u2014mean-ing some postsecondary training but not necessarily a degree\u2014including technical jobs that form the back-bone of the knowledge economy. In addition to skills, the current geography of economic growth limits access to opportunity, particularly in older urban neighborhoods and rural areas. Traditional urban-suburban growth patterns characterize the region, along with small towns and rural areas. center cities are experiencing a resur-gence that is an asset in the knowledge economy, but newer job centers have developed in areas not easily accessible on public transportation. National compari-sons have identified the Syracuse area as one of the most racially and economically segregated regions in the country. k e Y f inding: the 21ST centur Y requires modernizing l ocal government The next economy favors regions that are highly networked with fluid movement of goods, people, and ideas. It favors regions in which both government and civic governance are transparent, open, and adept at working collaboratively across sectors. The center-State region faces formidable challenges in this area largely related to the structure of local government and tax climate. The region has nine times the average number of governmental units per capita compared to the larg-est U.S. metropolitan areas. National comparisons also rank the tax climate in New york State among the worst, with a combined state and local tax burden that is the second highest in the nation as a percentage of income. Property taxes in five counties in the region are among the highest in the nation as a percentage of home values. Local government leaders in Onondaga county have taken initial steps to address this critical issue through the consolidation of some agencies and services, and they support the need to bring about further change. In addition to cost and efficiency, the large number of government jurisdictions also complicates deci-sion-making in critical areas, such as investments in infrastructure. centerState faces significant needs to upgrade infrastructure for the 21st century, including utility systems, electricity transmission, air service, freight capacity, and the extension of broadband in rural areas. n CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 106 CNY RISING | APPENDICES METROPOLITAN BUSINESS PLAN | CenterState Agenda for Economic Opportunity B.1centerstate new Y ork agenda for economic opportunitY 11agenda for economic opportunitY Based on these findings, the Agenda for Economic Opportunity recommends eight strategies designed to drive growth, build synergies across the region and create a new center of grav- ity for the next economy.

To pursue that opportunity as a platform for growth, the region will undertake a multi-pronged approach: develop a cluster with world-class capabilities, provide a skilled workforce, and create stronger connections to the region's formidable research institutions: establish the data to decisions innovation al- liance with the mission to grow and expand the cluster and related innovation capacity across the region create a skills Broker to match pre-qualified candidates with job openings in the D2D cluster particularly high-skilled positions in engineering and technical fields position the region as a leading center for d2d research through stronger linkages between this critical growth sector and the region's universi-ties and research institutes.strateg Y 2: strengthen the r egion's position as a l eader in cYB ersecuritY , thermal and e sYstems, and a griB usiness The region's strong natural resources, 21st century manufacturing sectors, and capacity for research and technology development position it for growth but require sustained focus on key tradable sectors. To that end, the region will: accelerate the growth of the thermal and envi - ronmental control systems cluster, particularly the region's small and medium-sized firms establish the region as a center for cyberse- curity, maintaining the critical asset offered by the Rome Laboratory and assisting the industry to enter new markets such as finance and healthcare grow agribusiness, Bioscience and natural re- source-based industries leveraging the region's logistics capabilities, land and water resources, aligning research and technology development to support innovation in agriculture and other industries.

First steps: implement the metropolitan export initiative to double regional exports in five years support immigration reform to increase oppor- tunities for international students to work in the region seek foreign direct investment to attract new sources of capital. strateg Y 4 : Build o ut a w orld c l a s s ecos Ystem for i nnovation and e ntrepreneurship The region must take to the next level its agenda to develop a robust innovation ecosystem by enhancing the range of capital resources available to entrepre-neurs and building stronger connections between the region's research institutions and firms in its criti-cal growth sectors. In addition to the pilot for D2D research described above, the region will: create a regional seed and venture fund Build the entrepreneurial e cosystem by expand- ing incubation space, strengthening support for student entrepreneurship, and forging stronger relationships between entrepreneurs and mentors.strateg Y 5: develop e mplo Yer-d riven approaches to a lign workers and JoB s Higher skills command higher wages and drive eco-nomic growth. Meeting the region's pressing need to increase the talent and skills of its workforce requires expanding the portfolio of education support, effec-tive workforce training, and talent attraction initia-tives and aligning them with targeted growth sectors. To strengthen the human capital pipeline and skills at all levels, the region will: establish a demand aggregator to catalyze an employer-driven workforce development system, beginning with the proposed skills broker for firms in the D2D cluster strengthen the human capital pipeline through community initiatives focused on raising education attainment across the board, with particular focus on lower-performing school districts and ground-breaking initiatives such as Say yes to Education Build on existing efforts to engage, retain, and attract talent by expanding successful programs, particularly those focused on younger workers. expand training programs that address the issue of re-connecting low-income workers to new eco-nomic opportunities, such as Green Train, Health Train and visions for change.

Top priorities should include: attract new air service to reduce costs and increase available flights develop an inland rail-freight port and upgrade capacity of the port of oswego create a transformative approach to renovate the i-81 viaduct in downtown syracuse enhance transit services linking neighborhoods to job centers support extension of Broadband into the North country and underserved rural areas support infrastructure upgrades by helping com- munities locate new sources of funding. strateg Y 7: cultivate o pportunitY r ich environments The smaller metropolitan and rural areas that make up the centerState region require different approach-es to create communities that attract the firms and workers that drive the next economy. Among ap-proaches to consider are initiatives designed to: leverage anchor institutions in higher educa- tion, healthcare, and the arts as key partners for jobs and community development strengthen the Job pipeline in communities of need through neighborhood-based training and strong linkages to employers with middle-skill jobs enhance transportation to employment cen- ters particularly those with high concentrations of entry-level and middle-skill jobs develop and promote market rate housing and urban infill through programs such as land banks implement onondaga county's sustainable growth plan and encourage development of simi-lar plans in other counties. strateg Y 8: Build e ffective p u B lic and c ivic i nstitutions and culture community structures for making decisions, respond-ing to changing economic conditions, and delivering critical public services must be nimble and effective. To lay the groundwork for proposing improvements to local government structures in the region, regional leaders should undertake to: develop a government modernization commis- sion for onondaga county viewing it as a pilot for other counties support regional economic development coun- cils as powerful drivers of economic development support citizen-driven solutions by making gov- ernment data publicly available and encouraging innovative, citizen-driven solutions.

The leadership team that oversaw development of the Agenda is committed to continuing its work, guid-ing and honing its strategies, and translating strategy into action. centerState cEO will serve as the hub and guardian of the Agenda, taking responsibility for implementation of its first wave of initiatives, securing resources, and expanding the circle of engaged part-ners throughout the region. It will establish and track performance metrics and report progress, monitoring regional economic output, job growth, wages, produc-tivity, and poverty rates to measure impact. An immediate step will involve integrating the Agenda with the work of major partners, begin-ning with the five Regional Economic Development councils that include counties in the region. Across three critical fronts, in the first wave of implementation the region will strengthen its tech-nology sectors, build out its innovation ecosystem, and launch development of a pragmatic approach to modernizing local government. establish the Data to Decisions innovation a lliance The Data to Decisions (D2D) Innovation Alliance will create a membership-based, business-driven entity that will serve as a hub for firms and entrepreneurs involved in all aspects of this rapidly evolving field. In partnership with a committee of leaders from firms in Data to Decisions sectors and advised by a panel of industry experts convened online, Battelle Technology Partnership Practice has drafted a full business plan for the Alliance that is available at www.centerstateopportunity.com. Its mission will focus on forging connections across industries to advance the D2D cluster through market scouting and deal matching, supporting new product development within companies, and new venture development. Implementation will require intense engagement with D2D businesses, the entrepreneurial ecosystem, and resources for commercialization and research. conservative projections indicate that by its fifth year of operation, the Alliance will enroll a hundred companies and generate up to fifty deal matches annually. Its activities will grow sales for member companies by more than $20 million annually, and, by its tenth year, twenty new firms will exist as a result of its work. The expectation is that the Alliance's impact will expand geometrically as it develops cross-sector partnerships among firms that use D2D technology in digital electronics, information systems, medical equipment and applications, and environmental prod-ucts clusters. Transferring knowledge and technologies among several of the region's most significant production sectors will create competitive advantage as a global center for D2D, leading to the establishment of new firms and products, creating new jobs, and providing global leadership for research, people, and companies in these important sectors. create a reG ional s eeD anD venture f unD With an initial capital call of $15 million and a goal to raise up to $40 million, the new regional Seed and venture Fund will close a significant gap in capital infrastructure to support entrepreneurs and early-stage firms. Operating in alignment with centerState cEO, the fund will work with entrepreneurial networks throughout the region, targeting companies seeking private financing in the $500,000 to $2 million range for expansion or growth. It will focus on firms in the region although it will not be restricted to regional firms or target industries. establish a Government moD ernization c ommission A commission on Government Modernization will explore approaches for improving local government in Onondaga county and propose a practical plan, based on public input and rigorous analysis of the costs and benefits of existing government structures. The commission will evaluate government modern- ization efforts around the country to develop recom-mendations for improving the delivery of services and increasing cost effectiveness. n CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 111 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CenterState Agenda for Economic Opportunity | METROPOLITAN BUSINESS PLAN B.1Brookings metropolitan polic Y program 16a call to a ction centerState New york holds the potential to change its eco- nomic trajectory, overcoming the losses of the past decades and establishing the region as a global center for innovation and technology in emerging knowledge industries. The Agenda for Economic Opportunity is ambitious and compre- hensive and will require sustained, focused effort backed by significant resources. centerState cEO and its partners will take the lead in com- municating the plan and pushing forward the work already underway to launch three lead initiatives. The ultimate success of the Agenda is up to the region. It must make the commitment to stay the course, building on initiatives already underway, expanding the reach of collaborative action, and undertak-ing significant new initiatives to change the region's economic path. Working together, its leaders and key institutions can redefine the region's economic profile and establish a new center of gravity for the next economy. n PHOTO cOURTESy OF: B OycE THOMPSON INSTITUTE CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 112 CNY RISING | APPENDICES METROPOLITAN BUSINESS PLAN | CenterState Agenda for Economic Opportunity B.1Photogra Phy: \u00a9 Corbis and CkPhotocenters for e conomic o pportunitY a m etropolitan Business p lan prepared in collaB oration with the Brookings i nstitution m etropolitan p olic Y program novemB er 2013 centerState cEO city of Syracuse Onondaga county Onondaga civic Development corporation Syracuse University Mohawk valley EDGE The community Foundation of Herkimer and Oneida counties, Inc. central New york community Foundation, Inc.

Source: UBRI analysis of data from the NYS Department of Labor and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.Research, development, and commercialization of new technologies related to unmanned aerial systems (UAS) will require the purchase of a mix of goods and services from a broad array of industry segments. The collection of these industry segments can be thought of as the UAS Supporting Cluster. Growing the local supply of goods and services produced by this cluster while aligning local supply chains for UAS innovators will maximize the impact potential of this growing Central Region specialization. Although the UAS sector is in its infancy in the Central Region, almost 1 in 12 private sector workers are currently employed at over 1,000 firms in industry segments that could potentially support future businesses focused on UAS. In the U.S., the UAS field is expected to grow at a rate of 50% in the first year after the technology is integrated into the national airspace system (NAS) and at a 5% rate every year thereafter. The two commercial and civil markets that are most likely to drive the demand for UAS are precision agriculture and public safety. By 2025, a total of 103,776 new jobs are forecasted to be created across the country and 33,763 are forecasted for NY, nearly half of which will be in manufacturing. Globally, research, development, testing, and evaluation (RDT&E) and procurement of UAS are forecasted to grow from $6.6 billion in 2013 to $11.4 billion in 2022, while total spending for the period is expected to be $89.1 billion. Approximately 46% of UAS spending will be on the vehicles themselves, 38% will be on the payloads, and 16% will be on ground control equipment. The Location Quotient (LQ) is a number that measures the relative concentration of an industry's employment or total wages in the region, as compared to the state or nation. Figures above one indicate an above average concentration, or a regional specialization ; the greater the number, the greater the specialization.

Overall, 12 out of 22 industry segments within the cluster have a higher than average concentration of employment in the Central Region when compared to the national average (employment LQ >1). Additionally, further analysis of each industry segment's competitiveness\u2014a combination of specialization and income generating ability\u2014reveals some potential targets for investment. Potential targets fall into three categories. Highly Competitive Highly specialized and above average income generating industry segments where the region currently has a strong competitive advantage. Opportunity for Specialization Industry segments exhibiting above average ability to generate income, but lacking specialization. Investments could focus on increasing regional specialization by growing employment and average wages. Specialized with Potential Specialized industries that are not capturing their fair share of wages per employee as compared to other regions across the country. Industry segments such as Electronic & Precision Equipment Repair, Other Professional, Scientific & Technical Srvcs, and Electrical Equip Mfg segments\u2014which all pay at or below the average regional wage of $42,398 \u2014 could benefit from an infusion of higher wage jobs that support UAS cutting edge technologies. With the ability to generate more dollars per worker than the national average, industry groups that excel in income generation can pay higher wages, accumulating greater wealth for the region.

UAS technology can be customized for just about any task that is currently carried out with aircraft or satellites. Increasingly, it is even being developed to substitute for people working on the ground. At least a dozen industry sectors are exploring how they can take advantage of UAS. For most, the use of a UAS is simply a change in the vehicle used for tasks that are already routine, such as photography, remote sensing, and distribution with greater potential for cost savings. In the Central Region, UAS could assist with the research and resource management activities associated with Biomedical and Forest Products clusters. A greater range of opportunities lie with the state's Front Office & Producer Services cluster (one of the Central Region's fastest growing clusters in terms of employment) and the Northeast's Business Services cluster which plays a role in nearly every sector exploring UAS technology. These clusters provide services that rely heavily on photography, remote sensing, and mapping, which are at the core of UAS' current capabilities. Which sectors could have demand for UAS technology?

ATLAS will include UAV capability, efficiency, monitoring, navigation and technique testing, as well as UAV pilot and MRO certification. Chosen for low environmental impact and excellent weather conditions, with 300 sunny days a year, the land is well connected to the rest of the world by land, sea, and sky, and includes some olive trees on site. Andalusia provides a range of incentives and services, such as job training resources, loans, and relationship managers, to bring additional UAS-related business. The region is also home to two other major UAS sites: the Center for Advanced Aerospace Technologies (\"CATEC\") research center, and the Center of Excellence for Unmanned Air Systems (\"CEUS\"). PARTNERSHIPS Boeing Research & Technology-Europe, Boeing's European research and development center, will perform flight testing at ATLAS since it agreed to a partnership in early 2014. ATLAS customers can choose between bringing their own operators or using ATLAS resources. The opening ceremony in spring 2014 featured the support of the regional minister of Economy, Innovation, Science and Employment; the Spanish government; the County Council of Jaen; the town of Villacarrillo; the Andalusian Innovation and Development Agency (\"IDEA\"); the Andalusian Foundation for Aerospace Development (\"FADA\"); and the Andalusian Association of Research and Industrial Cooperation (\"AICIA\"). FUNDING An initial $5.2 million (\u20ac4.5 million) for project implementation from Andalusia regional government (with President Susana Diaz's help), much of which is funded through European Union allocations, is jump starting ATLAS. Other sources of funding include the Regional Ministry of Economy, Innovation, Science and Employment; CATEC; FADA; the Andalusia ERDF Operational Programme 2007-2013; government; and the city of Madrid.

Two hangars, with potential to expand, will be built to accommodate maintenance, repair and overhaul servicing of air vehicles with a 12 meter maximum wingspan and 650 kg maximum takeoff weight. A control tower will include multi-purpose office spaces, and surveillance radar to track both UAVs and large birds for safety purposes. ATLAS is near the center of an isolated 400 square mile airspace with 5,000 feet in vertical limitation. ATLAS complements CATEC and CEUS which already operate in the region. CATEC research center employs 60 highly skilled workers and has already invested over $23 million (\u20ac21 million) in the UAS industry. CATEC will use nearly 15,000 feet (4,500 meters) of ATLAS facilities and offices to provide a range of its own UAS testing resources to the new site including pilot operators and UAS devices, among others. ATLAS, with its focus on light UAS testing, complements the existing CEUS which is dedicated to mid and large sized UAS testing. Andalusia is already Spain's second largest aerospace economy contributing 1.28% to Andalusia's global GDP and 17% to the industrial Andalusian GDP. ATLAS Flight Test Centre is Spain's first facility exclusively dedicated to light UAS technology testing. Madrid's UAV Navigation has tested a stabilized day or night camera and parachute that cruises at 70 knots, 11,500 feet high, and 220 mm range at ATLAS.

Grand Sky Park has fostered unparalleled state, federal, and commercial cooperation as the globe is realizing the endless market potential for UAS technology. Grand Sky, currently in its initial development phase, is the first U.S. commercial unmanned aircraft systems (\"UAS\") business and aviation park. It is conveniently located near the Canadian border; the Grand Forks Air Force base; multiple pilot training institutions; a city of 60,000 residents; and the Northern Plains FAA-approved UAS test site. Companies that lease space at Grand Sky Park will have access to airport services; planes; pilots; engineers; sensor operators; data analysis and management resources; and runways. PARTNERSHIPS Grand Sky Park boasts its proximity to major providers of pilot education and training when attempting to attract tenants. Specifically, the University of North Dakota's Center for UAS Research, Education, and Training, the Grand Forks Air Force base, and Northland Community & Technical College's aerospace program will power Grand Sky's skilled workforce. Northrop Grumman, a global aerospace and defense technology leader, was the first tenant to sign a lease at Grand Sky. The North Dakota Department of Commerce, the Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation, and other state and municipal entities have been instrumental in raising capital for the project. FUNDING The North Dakota Department of Commerce provides Grand Sky tenants with tax credits for research expenditures; corporate income tax credit for new and expanding businesses; tax exemptions for manufacturing equipment; and low interest loans. The State has invested over $30 million in the UAS industry in the last ten years and has allocated $12.5 million for UAS research and development in its 2015-2017 budget. This money will go towards building Grand Sky infrastructure and improving runways. About half of the $25 million needed to complete the Park will come from private entities.

Additionally, pilots will have the power to control on-site UAS devices from anywhere in the world. With Grand Sky Park's developments under way, much of North Dakota's economic focus has shifted to focus on UAS technology. In 2011, the University of North Dakota's (UND) Center of Excellence for Unmanned Aircraft Systems awarded the nation's first five specifically unmanned aviation-focused degrees. Now, one hundred students are enrolled in UND's UAS program, and there are more than 30 similar degree programs throughout the country. Grand Sky Park's industry investments have spurred a national push for sector-related workforce training, and have served as an international symbol of America's UAS competitive edge. The site has also expanded North Dakota's FAA-allotted UAS research area and produced the state's first commercially made unmanned aircraft. Unfortunately, the site was unsuccessful in attracting Amazon as a tenant. Amazon instead chose Canada for UAS exploration. This was likely due to the fact that Sky Park companies must lease UAS vehicles to the Park in order to comply with FAA regulations which requires flying under public domain. There is an ongoing battle between the FAA and commercial companies that feel U.S. regulations thwart experimentation and innovation. On the other hand, while this setback may deter larger companies, smaller local start-ups in nearby Fargo will see little obstacles and huge opportunities for development out of Grand Sky Park's comprehensive offerings.A one-stop shop for UAS research and development CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 167 CNY RISING | APPENDICES UBRI ANALYSIS | Central Region T argeted Analysis & Best Practices for T wo Initiatives C.214 Targeted Analysis and Best Practices for the Central Region's Initiatives, UB Regional Institute, July 2015 OVERVIEW The Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership (\"MAAP\") is a collaboration between the states of Virginia, New Jersey, and Maryland to fully service, test, and operate UAS devices. In compliance with FAA regulations, MAAP is dedicated to safety, certification, and exploration of the UAS industry at its FAA approved test site. The three-state partnership is unique because of its diverse airspace, geographic, and climate offerings. Also, an already existing agricultural economy in those states particularly allows for industry specific exploration opportunities. Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey will be a testing location for MAAP's mature operations that are ready for commercial passenger integration. Many other regional airspace collaborations make MAAP a central location for UAS experimentation. The Pax River Naval Air Station in Maryland, for example, has been operating UAS devices for decades. Virginia is home to two NASA aeronautics centers. MAAP offers existing regional partners the opportunity to expand their operational capacity. PARTNERSHIPS MAAP partners span academia; government; industry; and economic development agencies. Academic partnerships and economic development agencies are especially important in providing people with UAS workforce training and certification. Industrial partners can utilize MAAP resources, while the government provides funding and regulation. U.S. UAS leaders tend to be frustrated by restrictive FAA policies, however, MAAP views the FAA as a partner to serve and advance with instead of a burdening body. Examples of MAAP partners include AAI Corporation, Fredericksburg Regional Military Affairs Council, and Stockton Aviation Research and Technology Park. FUNDING In 2013, the Commonwealth of Virginia announced Federal Action Contingency Trust (\"FACT\") funding of $2.6 million to Virginia Tech for MAAP UAS testing. Funding was granted in the form of $1 million for fiscal year 2014, $1.2 million for fiscal year 2015, and $437,000 for fiscal year 2016. In 2015, Virginia's Wise County Industrial Development Authority, in conjunction with MAAP, was awarded $50,000 of the Appalachian Regional Commission grant for the Coal & Natural Resources Applications (\"CNRA\") Center of Excellence for UAS Operations. All three state governor's offices have committed funding. MAAP also generates revenue from services.Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership BLACKSBURG, VA DATE ESTABLISHED 2012 ORGANIZATIONAL GOVERNANCE Board of directors with committees including strategic operations; and partnerships including Associate Directors at Virginia Tech, the University of Maryland, and Rutgers\u2014each with their own staffs.

On August 13, 2014, MAAP conducted its first operational test flight at the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute. MAAP is currently home to 15 launch and recovery sites that are nearly or totally operational, with nine sites pending completion. MAAP offers 200 Certificates of Authorization nationwide for small UAS operations. Team members at MAAP accumulatively have over 70,000 hours of safe UAS flight experience, standing on the shoulders of MAAP founder institutions that have important industry expertise in areas such as robotics. At MAAP, entities and the federal government can test UAS devices and sensors, and conduct air traffic management research. Additionally, companies have the opportunity to commercialize at MAAP quicker than they can overcome regulatory challenges thereby making the site an attractive resource for marketization. Recently, MAAP conducted UAS testing at Cape May Airport in an effort to integrate UAS devices into the current piloted aviation system. Part of the current challenge when using UAS was coordinating efforts with manned aircrafts also operating at the small airport. Tests like these inform advancements in safety protocols that MAAP is researching and developing. Much of the data acquired will be shared with regional academic institutions which can adjust their programming to fit industry needs and provide technical support. Virginia's rural field hospital and MAAP are coordinating medicine delivery to test technological deployment options in the event of a global humanitarian crisis. News organizations, including ABC, the New York Times, and thirteen others, are collaborating with Virginia Tech on UAS testing.Pooling resources to capitalize on the growing UAS industry ahead of the market CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 169 CNY RISING | APPENDICES UBRI ANALYSIS | Central Region T argeted Analysis & Best Practices for T wo Initiatives C.216 Targeted Analysis and Best Practices for the Central Region's Initiatives, UB Regional Institute, July 2015 CAYUGAOSWEGO MADISONONONDAGA CORTLANDCORTLANDCANASTOTA SYRACUSESTERLINGPARISH FULTON AUBURN CAZENOVIAOSWEGOSANDY CREEK CICERO CLAY SALINA Where are the region's vulnerable workers?INITIATIVE #2 Workforce Alignment TARGETED RESEARCH To target workforce development initiatives, it is important to look at where vulnerable working age populations\u2014those individuals age 18-64 living in or near poverty (defined here as earning an income less than double the federal poverty line) are located. Lighter shading on the map shows where concentrations of these individuals reside. Altogether, 134,308 vulnerable working age individuals live in the Central Region. In other words, more than a quarter of the working age population is in need of a job or a better paying job. The number of persons in poverty (66,154) is nearly as great as those near poverty (68,154). The largest concentration of vulnerable individuals is in and around Syracuse. In fact, regionwide 44% of those working age individuals in or near poverty live in Syracuse and the towns to the north of the city: Cicero, Clay and Salina. In the City of Syracuse, 46% of working age individuals are in or near poverty (44,594 altogether); and more than not are living on the lowest economic rung\u2014incomes under the federal poverty level. Outside of Onondaga County, smaller cities like Auburn, Cortland, Oswego and Fulton are home to thousands of individuals in or near poverty.

Access to jobs, skills training and public transit represent opportunities for greater economic sufficiency for those in need. While economic vulnerability in terms of absolute numbers is concentrated in and around Syracuse, so are workforce supports, particularly workforce trainers. Of the region's 53 trainers eligible for funding under the Workforce Investment Act, 75% are located in Onondaga County, with most in Syracuse, East Syracuse and Liverpool (see map on page 17). Public transit also exists in the region's urban core, offering access to workforce trainers in the area. Yet job openings are often outside the City of Syracuse, in areas, for instance, north of the city. These areas, with usually just a single route in and out, are considerably less accessible by public transit. Outside Onondaga County, job openings are more aligned with the geographic distribution of people in need. The greatest number of openings (50 or more) are often where large concentrations of vulnerable working age individuals live, such as in Fulton, Oswego, Auburn and Cortland. Yet for those in need of training and skills development to be considered for these jobs, usually only one or two options at most exist in the nearby vicinity. For those in the heart of Canastota, no nearby options exist. There is access to public transit in several small cities like Oswego, Fulton and Auburn; but those in places like Canastota and Cortland generally need a car to access training and jobs. What barriers exist to training and higher-paying work for vulnerable populations? While some barriers stem from limited access to jobs, training and transportation, others relate to personal circumstances, like being a single parent or having limited fluency in English. Complicating circumstances further, hard to place workers often face more than one barrier to finding higher paying jobs. An understanding of who the hard to place workers are will help the region tailor workforce programs and investments. Limited education is the most common barrier hard to place workers face. Over 113,600 adults with a high school diploma or less live in the high need areas across the region; and 25,238 (22%) are in poverty. Nearly half of those living in poverty with limited education live in Syracuse, concentrated in neighborhoods bordering the I-481 and I-690. Outside the city, these individuals live in Oswego, Fulton, Auburn and Cortland. Part time workers are the second largest group of hard to place workers, with over 72,000 living in high need areas and 20,087 (28%) in poverty. This is a poverty rate notably higher than for those with limited education, underscoring the importance of full time work, particularly for those without advanced skills. While the number of part time workers is higher outside Syracuse, the poverty rate among those part time workers dwelling in the city is considerably higher (43% vs. 21%), perhaps reflecting a prevalence of single income households in Syracuse. Single parent households are, in fact, a category of hard to place workers with one of the highest poverty rates. Over half (52%) of single parent households in high need areas across the region live in poverty. The majority of those in poverty live in high need areas in the City of Syracuse where the poverty rate among single parents is 68%, compared to 40% for single parents in high need areas outside the city. Not shown is another group of individuals for which poverty and detailed geographic data was not available\u2014the 6,877 across the region with a criminal record and currently on probation or parole. 1 Also notable (but not shown) are the over 1,000 homeless individuals in the region, mostly concentrated in Onondaga County in need of work and an affordable place to live. 2 INITIATIVE #2 Workforce Alignment TARGETED RESEARCH 1 UBRI analysis of data of data from NYS Department of Corrections and Community Supervision and NYS Division of Criminal Justice Services. 2 UBRI analysis of data from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Filling the void, BACH provides vocational training, internships, and career coaching for entry level health care workers in order to promote career advancement and sustainability in the industry. Increased performance and retention rates, and partnerships between employers and training providers result from the targeted effort towards fostering personal economic independence and collective workforce enhancements. Leadership at the organization includes executive directors, employer coaches, executive consultants, as well as oversight from its own board of directors and boards of other health care organizations. BACH takes a system-wide approach toward reversing the existing skills gap with initiatives to inform workers of career pathways; implement training models; create opportunities for youth to enter the field; and support health care providers in enhancing staff outcomes. PARTNERSHIPS Partners span educational institutions; non-profits; government agencies; workforce training specialists; and health care providers. They include the Baltimore City Community College; Baltimore County Public Schools; St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center; the Governor's Workforce Investment Board; Johns Hopkins; and the Center for Urban Families; among others. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the Hitachi Foundation, the U.S. Department of Labor, and the Mayor's Office of Employment Development supported the implementation of a State approved training initiative called 1st Span Training Program, which advances health care careers. FUNDING BACH receives financial support from various foundations including Abell; Annie E. Casey; Baltimore Community; Goldseker; Hitachi; Robert Baltimore; Straus and Lillie Straus; Alvin and Fanny B. Thalheimer; and Harry and Jeanette Weinberg. Additionally, it receives support from the U.S. Department of Labor and the Mayor's Office of Employment Development. BACH also collaborates with funders and partners. For example, the Johns Hopkins Community Health Partnership is specifically focused on improving health outcomes for low-income people.

Career Mapping shows criteria for Baltimore health care jobs as well as career pathways. Thousands have seen these career maps in hospitals, schools, and community organizations. The 1st Span Training Program trains entry level employees to be nursing assistants, then nurse extenders with a State approved CNA curriculum. The Pre-Allied Health Bridge Program trains people who are already involved in or are seeking careers in health care. It offers pre-college level courses. In spring 2008, Pre-Allied Health Bridge completed two programming cycles. BACH Fellows is a six week workshop for rising high school seniors that offers paid hospital internship experience. It is supported by six Baltimore hospitals and hosts 60 students every summer. Students come away with an Individualized Development Plan. Targeting this age group ensures health care industry exposure and pipeline development. The Career Toolkit, benefitting six hospitals, two long-term care facilities, and 400 employees, assists employers in training and retaining staff. Approximately 70% of BACH coaching services participants remained in their jobs for six or more months and continued to receive employee benefits. 75% of people coached saw a wage increase if they spent a year or more in their position. BACH's Career Coaching services benefit five Baltimore hospitals and 400 of their entry level employees. Approximately 72% of those employees have graduated from some level of training, with 40% having been promoted. Between September 2005 and May 2007, Career Coaching students averaged a 13.5% wage increase. In the first cycle of the 1st Span Training Program at Good Samaritan Hospital, 94% of students graduated from the nursing assistant training. Challenges include securing vital face-to-face time with hospital executives and convincing them of BACH's importance and the reality that the medical industry is a competitive and fast-moving market.

Each regional cluster and its major component subclusters have been defined by North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) at the most detailed (6- digit) levels. These cluster definitions are included in a n Appendix table that follows the cluster profiles. Data Analysis & Methodology Overview Detailed industry cluster profiles have been prepared that include the following indicators and metrics for the 5-County Central New York Region with U.S. comparisons, where available. The 5- County region includes \u2014Cortland, Cayuga, Onondaga, Oswego, and Madison Counties.

Target Industry Assessment: Approach For a more in -depth analysis of each industry cluster, Battelle has analyzed the detailed subcluster components to assess the underlying drivers of the regional cluster and how they might be considered. In a standard regional economic analysis approach, there are three basic regional economic measures used to assess the position of an industry for a specific region : Relative concentration of the local industry or \"location quotient\" (LQ) to measure industry specialization in the region. If a region has a 20% or greater concentration relative to its overall private sector and compared with the national average ( e.g. an LQ > 1.2), then the regional cluster is considered to be \"specialized\" Employment changes for the regional cluster (now focusing on the economic recovery period of 2009 -13) Relative growth of the regional cluster compared to national growth Battelle uses an Industry Targeting Analysis approach that applies these regional economic measures to understand the current position and trajectory of an industry for a region (see Figure below). Industry Targeting Analysis: Decision Tree CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE 186 CNY RISING | APPENDICES BATTELLE REPORTS | Central New York Industry Cluster Assessment, 2015 D.1Battelle-CenterState CEO Central New York Cluster Assessment, 2015 4 By deploying the tools of industry targeting analysis, Battelle objectively and quantitatively assesses the detailed industry subclusters into specific growth categories: Current strengths - Specialized, growing in jobs at a rate faster than the nation. Current opportunities - Specialized, growing in jobs but not as fast as the nation. Current specialization - Specialized, but declining in jobs Emerging strengths - Not specialized, but growing in jobs at a rate faster than the nation Emerging opportunity - Not specialized, but growing in jobs though not as fast as the nation Limited prospects - Not specialized and not growing in jobs Industry Output & Productivity Analysis To assess overall cluster output and productivity, Battelle has utilized IMPLAN's input/output models and their concepts of output and value-added. In the IMPLAN models \"Output\" represents the estimated value of industry production. For manufacturers this represents sales plus/minus change in inventory. For service sectors production equals sales. \"Value Added\" represents the difference between an industry's total output and the cost of its intermediate inputs. It is a measure of the contribution to GDP made by an individual industry and is therefore more akin to the concept of Gross Domestic Product. The le vel of productivity of a regional industry measures the value added generated by each job. Comparing the productivity of a local industry to its national level provides insights into whether the local industry is more or less competitive. Higher levels of productivity of a local industry compared to national levels mean that for each job more economic output is generated suggesting that a local industry is better able to make use of advances in technology to produce goods and services and is able to produ ce more complex, higher value products. Industry sectors defined and used by IMPLAN do not always correspond in a 1:1 fashion with the federal NAICS system. Battelle has aligned the definitions as closely as possible for each industry cluster. Industry Exports To estimate current export levels, gains or losses, and direct jobs associated with the regional industry clusters , Battelle has utilized Brookings' Export Monitor database. The database utilizes several data sources to estimate national exports by the actual location of production, not by origin- of-movement which is the typical approach used for measuring exports. This unique methodology is developed down to a county level, which allows for assessments at a regional and metro area level. The 5 -county region has been combined from the database for regional estimates of exports. As in the case with the Industry Output and Productivity data, the level of industry detail differs to some degree from the more detailed NAICS definitions we have used in the employment analysis and Battelle has aligned the definitions as closely as possible for each industry cluster.

Given this limitation, Battelle has developed an approach to approximate or estimate the potential level of industry R&D related to each regional industry cluster. The approach is to apply the Central New York region's share of statewide industry employment against the level of industry R&D for New York in the most relevant industries for which the National Science Foundation reports (most typically at a 3- or 4-digit NAICS level). Battelle has included R&D estimates for relevant component industries within each cluster , where they are available. To comp lement this analysis, Battelle has also investigated the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings of some of the largest public companies headquartered or doing business in Central New York to provide some basic insights on their levels of global R&D expenditure and whether these have increased or decreased in recent years.

patents as references in documenting the new IP they create The referenced patents usually contain fundamental ideas/concepts used in developing the new IP protected by subsequent patents The original patent is said to generate forward citations for all patents that reference its IP The extent to which a patent generates forward citations can be used as proxy for its value in creating \"forward innovation\" Critical IP that fundamentally advances the state of technology or science in an area will likely be cited by many other patents in further advancing the area (or new areas) -can identify \"choke points\" in innovation where certain IP acts as the enabler of further innovation activity Business Sensitive 11CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION

connections in forward citations Provides a way to approximate the manner in which innovative capabilities are organized in a geographic area and how ideas flow to and from various applications areas The areas where forward citations are occurring can indicate whether patents are creating \"siloed \" innovation just in their own class areas or whether they are generating multidisciplinary innovation through applications in other areas (e.g. a data processing patent being cited by a medical device patent used for processing patient records as well as an aviation equipment patent that cites the patent for use in a piece of sensor processing hardware) Technology areas can be connected via \"bridging\" application areas -strengthening these areas can increase the flow of innovative research between isolated areas in the network and lead to strengthening of entire network Average forward citations per patent in CNY patenting areas from 2010 -2015 is ~3 Average for U.S. during

With representatives from Onondaga County, the City of Syracuse, the Onondaga Town Supervisors Association, the Onondaga Village Mayors Association, and the business, nonprofit, higher education an d K-12 education communities, the Commission has designed a process where stakeholders across the region are taking a leadership role in defining how it wants to be organized and governed locally, with high quality standards at an affordable price. To facilitate the analysis of local gover nance across the County and help design the modernization plan, the Commission engaged Rochester, New York-based CGR to support the process. As a precursor to identifying and evaluating modernization options, CGR completed a \"Baseline Phase\" review of existing conditions across all local governments countywide. The review is intended to establish a shared information foundation for the Commission, local government stakeholders and the broader public, and to provide a \"d ata source\" for the Commission to draw on as it moves into analysis and considerati on of modernization options. The review is not intended to be the full universe of data the Commission will consider during this process, but rather a \"jumping off\" point for more detailed discussion. This baseline review is specifically intended to provide a starting point for assisting the Commission and broader community of stakeholders in understanding the following: What does the local government univers e look like in Onondaga County - how many local governments exist, and of what types and administrative structures? How is the local public service deli very framework structured across Onondaga County - which entities provide which services, where and at what cost? What is the total cost of local governme nt in Onondaga County - how much is collectively spent on all administr ative and service delivery components? How many local government service providers are there in common functional areas across Onondaga County?

Readers should note that the baseline review is a \"clinical\" presentation of Onondaga County's local government universe today. It does not include an identification of alternatives or analysis of potential modernization options, nor recommendations for the Commission or community to consider. Those elements will follow in the next phase of the project, and will build on the baseline information. The exclusive purpose of this report is to establish a shared, fa ctual \"point of departure\" for all stakeholders - Commissioners, local government leaders, public employees and labor groups, taxpayers, residents, businesses and other organizations that call the region home. Format of the Baseline Review The baseline review is comprised of three sections, as summarized below. Baseline Review: Section I This section focuses on the overall lo cal government universe across Onondaga County. It documents the number, type and structure of units delivering critical public services, and provides financial context fo r which governments - and which levels of government - are spending how much in each functional area. It also offers historic context on how local government spending ha s changed in the past five and ten years across Onondaga County, as well as background on local government revenue. Baseline Review: Section II This second section focuses on individual local government units across Onondaga County, providing standard-format information on spending, services delivered, tax rates, socioeconomics, form of admin istration and budg etary structure. Baseline Review: Section III This final section focuses on individual service areas, as opposed to the individual government units. It provides information on who is providing what service and where within the County, as a starting point for identifying functional commonalities across the region's communities. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE356 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CONSENSUS | Local Government in Onondaga County, NY - Preliminary Baseline Review - Section 1 E.11-3 www.cgr.org Overview This baseline review provides an overview of local government across Onondaga County, New York. The report, the fir st developed for the Commission on Local Government Modernization as part of the Co nsensus effort, presents information on every local government and service area currently in place in Onondaga County. Its primary goal is to establish a foundational understanding of how the region's local governments are structured, funded and deliver critical public services. Project Background The Consensus effort - a first-of-its-kind project in New York State - was launched in early 2014 with the appo intment of the Commission on Local Government Modernization. Chaired by Co rnelius (Neil) B. Murphy (Former President, SUNY ESF), M. Catherine Richa rdson (Retired Attorney , Bond Schoeneck & King, PLLC) and James T. Walsh (Government Affairs Counselor at K&L Gates LLP, and former U.S. Congressman), the Commission's representation spans the region's local government, business, education, higher education and nonprofit communities. The Consensus pr oject received major bipartisan support in the form of a $250,000 state grant secured by State Senator John A. DeFrancisco, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and supported by State Senator David J. Valesky. The Commission's inaugural meeting was held in February 2014. Following a public request for proposal process, the Commission engaged Rochester, New York-based CGR in June 2014 to provide technical, analytical and plan design assistance. In order to ensure representativeness and effectiveness of the Commission's work, appointees to the Commission span a broad range of stakeholders and constituencies. Commissioners are as follows: C ornelius B. Murphy (Co-Chair) SUNY ESF (Ret.) M. Catherine Richardson (Co-Chair) Bond, Schoeneck & King (Ret.) James T.

Organizations including SYRACUSE 20/20, CenterState CEO, FOCUS Greater Syracuse, the League of Women Voters of Syracuse Metropolitan Area, the Onondaga Citizens League, and the Homebuilders and Remodelers Association of Central New York collectively called for the creation of a local government moder nization commission. The effort was also one of four key initiatives outlined in the region's 2013 CenterState New York Agenda for Economic Opportunity. Moreover, the region's local governments themselves have been leaders in pursuing collaboration and shared service across a range of functions. Baseline interviews with nearly every local government in the community have identified collaborative efforts in police, purchasing, tax collection, assessment, highways, wastewater treatment, code enfo rcement, facilities, fina ncial management, animal control and more. Each of those initiati ves was predicated on a shared desire to maintain - or even enhance - service quality while achieving cost savings through collaboration. Still, competitiveness remains an issue Notwithstanding previous efforts, economic vitality has remained an issue in the region. Overall, Onondaga County has experienced no net population growth over the past forty-plus years, with its estimated 2013 population (468,387) essentially flat to its 1970 level (472,835), during a period in which New York State's population grew nearly 8 percent and the nation's increased 55 pe rcent. And population growth challenges are not confined to just one community - wh ile it is true that the City of Syracuse experienced the greatest raw decline in population between the 2000 and 2010 decennial census, seven of the region's 19 to wns and eleven of its 15 villages also experienced drops. From 2002 to 2012, private sector em ployment in Onondaga County contracted 3 percent and the number of private busine ss establishments dropped by 1 percent. At the same time, the region's tax compet itiveness has remained challenged. In July 2012, data reported by the Tax Foundation ranked Onondaga County 70th (of 806 counties nationwide) in property taxes as a percent of median household income and 14th in property taxes as a percent of home value. And for local governments, the effects of the 2007-09 recession and policy changes at the state level - most notably the pro perty tax cap enacted in 2011 - have complicated an already challenging fiscal environment. Balancing budgets while sustaining high quality, essential servi ces has become increasingly difficult. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE359 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CONSENSUS | Local Government in Onondaga County, NY - Preliminary Baseline Review - Section 1 E.11-6 www.cgr.org The Commission's Goals Against this backdrop, the Commission has established two primary goals for this process. First, it seeks to further the re gion's collective understanding of local governments and the services they deliver across Onondaga County, and to provide a common baseline of knowledge for residents, officials and stakeholders interested in optimizing services and costs countywide. Recognizing that \"you can't manage what you can't measure,\" the Commission's first order of business was to establis h an objective knowledge base on how tax dollars are used - and how critical services are delivered - throughout the community. That information is documented in this review - which local governments spent what amounts, what they spend it on, how much that spending overlaps across the region's local government units, where the tax dollars come from, and which governments are responsible for providing which services. From the Commission's perspective, these data provide an essentia l starting point for any conversation of government modernization. Second, following this baseline phase the Commission will evaluate a range of potential modernization options. These options are likely to span a continuum of alternatives, from additional \"informal\" shared service arrangements and \"formal\" contract-based frameworks for local governments to increase collaboration, to possible shared service, subregional or regional approaches to deliver essential services to the Onondaga community. An Overview of Local Government in Onondaga County Understanding the basic structure of a community's local government is a fundamental prerequisite to understanding \"w ho does what, where and for what cost.\" The local government mosaic in Onondaga County consists of thirty-six general purpose local governments serving approxi mately 468,000 residents - One county government, one city government, ni neteen towns and fifteen villages: Goal #1: Further the region's understanding of local governments and the services they deliver across the County Goal #2: Evaluate a range of modernization options to determine how they can reduce cost and increase effectiveness CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE360 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CONSENSUS | Local Government in Onondaga County, NY - Preliminary Baseline Review - Section 1 E.11-7 www.cgr.org County (1): Onondaga City Solvay and Tully Every taxpayer in Onondaga County funds (and receives services from) at least two general purpose local governments - the County and their respective municipality. For example, residents in the City of Syracuse are served by both the City and County governments. Similarly, residents in each of the nineteen towns are served not only by their own town government, but also the County government.

Onondaga County - both as a government and service provider - spans every community in the county.

Onondaga County + Town of Tully + Village of Tully 36. Onondaga County + Town of Van Buren 37. Onondaga County + Town of Van Buren + Village of Baldwinsville Depending on location within the County, residents are also covered by certain special service districts. Among them are twenty (20) stand-alone fire districts, which are governed by their own publicly elected boards of commissioners and have taxing authority independent of any local government. And while the Commission's primary focus is on local government, it should be noted that there are twenty-six (26) separate school districts serving portions of the County, all but one of which has separate taxing authority and therefore impact property tax bills. 1 Economic Connections The very existence of individual local gover nment units and communities often lead observers to view a county or region in terms of its component units. But in many ways, those component units are intimately ti ed to one another. Although the region's local government structure - and the units that comprise it - is the focus of the Consensus effort, it is critically important to acknowledge the regional economic connections that exist between and among the communities of Onondaga County. Local governments are lega lly separate entities, each with its own elected leadership and service delivery framework, but they serve communities and constituents that are vital parts of a broader regional economic marketplace. Indeed, academic research and economic development strategies have increasingly stressed the interconnectedness of communities wi thin larger regions. Acknowledging those connections and viewing each local community in a broader context is a prerequisite to an effort like Consensus. 1 The Syracuse City School District is considered a \"dependent\" school district under State law, meaning that it is reliant on the City of Syracuse's propert y tax levy to fund the local share. The City School District does not have its own taxing authority independent of the City. Four other urban districts in New York State are similarly structured: Buffalo, New York City, Rochester and Yonkers. 20: The number of communities where more than 80% of residents live and work in different towns 37: The number of unique local government combinations covering residents in Onondaga County CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE363 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CONSENSUS | Local Government in Onondaga County, NY - Preliminary Baseline Review - Section 1 E.11-10 www.cgr.org One high-level way to demonstrate these economic connections is by looking at commuting patterns. The flow of peop le and commerce within the County - specifically, the nexus between where people live and work - offer context on just how connected all parts of the region are in contributing to an interrelated economic ecosystem. The overwhelming majority of employed Onondaga County residents work in a community other than the one in which they live. More than 69 percent of workers leave their \"home\" community to travel to work, and the average duration of that commute is 19 minutes. The rates are considerably higher in some pa rts of the region. For example, 89 percent of Town of Otisco residents work in another community, as do 86 percent of Geddes residents, 84 percent of Salina residents and 80 percent of Clay residents. Only in the City of Syracuse - where much of the region's economic activity is concentrated - do a majority (nearly two-thirds) of residents ac tually work in the same place they live.

Local governments exist to provide services to their communities, such as public works, courts, public safety, zoning, planning and basic governance ( i.e. executive and legislative leadership). Invariably, there are costs associated with those services. This section examines the full cost of providing local government services in Onondaga County, by each level of local government. Onondaga County and its local governments (excluding school districts 2) spent a combined $1.7 billion in 2013, or the equivalent of nearly 6 percent of the Syracuse Metropolitan Area's GDP.3 As the single largest government and service provider in the community, Onondaga County is responsible for the overwhelming majority of those expenditures ($1.1 billion). Municipalities, 2 School districts serving Onondaga Co unty collectively spent nearly $1.4 billion in 2013. Thus, the $1.7 billion spent by general purpose local governments and fire distri cts accounted for approximately 55 percent of total local public sector spending across Onondaga County in 2013. 3 The Syracuse Metropolitan Area is defined by th e Census Bureau to include Onondaga, Oswego and Madison counties. Metropolitan GDP data are drawn from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis. $1.7 billion: The total spent by Onondaga County and its local governments in 2013, not counting school districts CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE365 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CONSENSUS | Local Government in Onondaga County, NY - Preliminary Baseline Review - Section 1 E.11-12 www.cgr.org including the City of Syracuse, towns an d villages spent a combined $578 million. Fire districts reported an additional $11 million. Spread across the total countywide population, local government spending occurred at a per capita rate of $3,651. This \"grand total\" figure is, of course, not actually borne by any individual taxpayer, since no one person is simultaneously subject to county, city, fire district, town and village costs. Even within towns, not all town residents pay for every cost ( e.g. village residents and town-outside-village residents typically pay different rates). As such, the total figure is for illustra tive purposes only. Similarly, even within categories costs vary, as some towns / villages spend more while others spend less. However, readers can estimate the degree of cost layering by adding together the per capita local spending rate for specific categories. For example, the 2013 combined per capita spending rate for resi dents in the City of Syracuse was $4,667 - that is, the City rate of $2,253 plus the County's rate of $2,414. Similarly, the average village resident was subject to a village spending rate of $1,583, plus a town spending rate of $546, plus the County spending rate of $2,414, for a total of $4,543. 2 013 P er Capita4 County $1.13 b $2,414 $325.99 Fire $11.66 m n/a5 Grand Total $1.70 b $ 3,651 How Has Spending Grown? From 2003 to 2013, the total cost of local government across Onondaga County increased by approximately 34 percent. By comparison, the rate of inflation over that period was 29 percent as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI Northeast Urban). During that period, total per capi ta local government spending grew from $2,816 to $3,651. 4 Per capita figures are derived using the 2013 Census population estimates for only that category of government in Onondaga County. For example, the county-level per capita uses total countywide population as the denominator; the city-level figure uses total population just in the City of Syracuse; the town-level figure uses total population in just the nineteen towns, which includes residents in villages within those towns. 5 As fire districts are not recognized by the Census Bureau as discrete geog raphic units, no population figure is recorded for them in the same way as local government units. As such, a true per capita figure is not calculable.

Due to an accounting change promulgated on all county governments by the State Comptroller after 2003, counties were required to include in their budget not only the county share of sales tax receipts (as a revenue), but the entirety of the amount shared with other local governments (as both an expenditure and a revenue item). As a result, the County expenditure figures used in this analysis differ from the numbers contained in the official County budget or State Comptroller financial reports for 2008 and 2013, as those are presented in accordance with the updated accounting treatment. Who's Spending What? The following summary reflects total reported expenditures for each general purpose local government in Onondaga County in 20 13. As the region's largest government, Onondaga County itself accounted for the vast majority of total spending - approximately two-thirds. The City of Syracuse accounted for 19 percent of the total. Per capita spending rates among town governments ranged from $255 to more than $900. Villages' per capita spend was generally higher tha n that of their surrounding towns, due in part to their smaller population base. Per capita spending rates are derived based upon the population size of each jurisdiction. For example, the County's per capita rate is based upon total county population, while individual municipalities' rates are based on their own population levels. For towns, total townwide population is used, notwithstanding that certain town budget funds may apply to only segments of the community ( e.g. townwide plus village, town outside village, etc.). 2 013 % of Total P er Capita P er Mi2 County Onondaga REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE367 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CONSENSUS | Local Government in Onondaga County, NY - Preliminary Baseline Review - Section 1 $1,706,624,437 1 00% * The Village of Solvay's figure includes the aggregate cost as reported by the Office of the State Comptroller, which (as discussed in greater detail below) includes not only general services but the Village's rate-based municipal utility. Removing util ity costs, the 2013 expenditure total is reduced to $6,640,585, represents less than 1 percent of total c ountywide spending, equates to a per capita figure of $1,023 and a per square mile figure of $4,150,366. The range of expenditures and per capita costs in the preceding table reflect a diversity of local governments across On ondaga County - local governments that serve areas of differing geographic size, differing population sizes and densities, and differing types and levels of public service. Thus, the spending and per capita figures do not necessarily reflect \"higher\" or \"lower\" relative levels of efficiency among communities. In a very real way, there are \"stories\" behind each of the numbers. CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE368 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CONSENSUS | Local Government in Onondaga County, NY - Preliminary Baseline Review - Section 1 E.11-15 www.cgr.org Take the Village of Solvay, for example . At $28.9 million, its reported 2013 spending level (and per capita rate of $4,457) is significan tly higher than every other village government in the County. This is not reflective of a larger geography or population - 3rd and 6th among villages, respectively, in those categories. Rather, it reflects a unique service offering. The Village of Solvay owns and operates a municipal electric company, one of the state's largest, delivering discounted power to approximately 5,500 customers in the Village and neighboring Lakeland. The Village's electric department includes approximately 20 employees and accounted for more than $20.4 million in 2013 expenditures, with costs offset by ratepayers. What's it Being Spent On? In any region, the service menu differs ac ross local governments. For example, county governments in New York State are deeply involved in the delivery of social services, whereas towns and villages generally are not. Moreover, services often differ even within the same category of local government. For example, one town may have its own municipal police force, while another may not (rather, choosing to receive law enforcement services solely from the County Sheriff). The following summary presents local government costs in Onondaga County by service, to illustrate the areas in which local governments are collectively investing at least $3 million. The summary looks only at service categories, excluding fringe benefits, debt service and other miscellaneous expenditures (which are discussed further below). At $267.6 million, social se rvice-related spending represents the single-largest local government functional cost center among the general purpose local governments of Onondaga County. The next largest functional spending area is sewer ($146.8 million), followed by public works and highways ($140.9 million), police ($88.2 million), public health ($66.5 million) and fire ($60.8 million). Significant public investments are also made in probation / jail services, water, culture / recreation and community dev elopment, among other areas. The functional-area costs reflect ed in the following table are exclusive of employee fringe benefit costs. F unctional Area 2013 P er Capita Social Services $267,592,321 $571 $146,816,591 $313 Public Works $140,925,340 $188 CENTRAL NEW YORK REGIONAL EC ONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL | UPSTATE REVITALIZATION INITIATIVE369 CNY RISING | APPENDICES CONSENSUS | Local Government in Onondaga County, NY - Preliminary Baseline Review - Section 1 E.11-16 www.cgr.org Public Health $66,488,683 $142 Health Note: Public Safety includes services distinct from Police and Fire, such as jail / corrections, emergency communications, traffic control, animal control and safety inspections. Aside from functional cost centers, there are a number of cost centers that are not always directly allocated to specific services but rather presented as \"unallocated\" items spanning all areas of a government's budget. In certain cases, these are material items: The most significant is e mployee fringe benefits, which include pension costs for current employees and, where applicable, employee and retiree health benefits. At $337.6 million, fringes were the single-lar gest cost category for Onondaga County's local governments in 2013 - larger than any functional area. They are also among the most rapidly growing cost centers - fr om 2003 to 2013, fringe benefit costs rose 95 percent across Onondaga Count y's local governments, more than double the growth rate of local government spending overall and three times the rate of inflation over the same period. In raw dollar terms, fringes accounted for about one-third of the total local government spending increase over the ten year period. Another is reported by the State Comptroller's Office as \" other,\" at $238.8 million, which is made up predominantly of County expense items.

How are expenditures in each function spread across the county, city, towns, villages and fire districts? Who is spending in which area? The following summary presents the same functional detail as the previous section, but breaks out spending by level of government. To the extent these data might be used as a starting point to inform opportunities for shared service and other efficiency improvements, this detail is essential. It is notable that the single-largest functional spending category (social services) involves only one government - the County. This is hardly surprising and is typically the case across New York, since the state's structure for social service programming and administration vests significant responsibili ty at the county level. But it illustrates an important point: In order to most effectively use these data to identify collaborative opportunities, we need to know which levels of government are involved in providing and funding specific services. Stated differently, in which functional areas is local government spending most disaggregated across multiple levels of government? Public works is one example of a function where every level of local government in the community - indeed, every individual general purpose government - is spending money. Of the $140.9 million spent countywide on public works and highways in 2013, the County accounted for 52 percent, the City of Syracuse 10 percent, towns 31 percent and villages 7 percent.

In those cases, residents have the option to privately contract with a trash hauler on their own and pay the vendor d irectly. Though this is a true cost to the taxpayer, it is not reflected in the government cost figures. Similarly, library costs only reflect funds that flow through local government budgets. For school district public libraries or association libraries whose budgets are voted on separately, their true costs are not reflected in the figures above. The disaggregation of spending by level of government, as shown in the above table, can serve as an important tool for helpin g to target explorations of collaborative opportunities. However, knowing who does what among local governments is where the \"rubber meets the road\" in terms of identifying intermunicipal opportunities. The individual municipal and service profiles contained later in this report present detailed information by government and function on who does what, where and at what cost. As a starting point, the following matrix graphically shows how many of the community's local governments spend how much in which service areas. The number of blocks evidences the level of spending commonality - that is, more shaded cells indicate more local governments involved in a particular service. Each local government that spends at least $10,000 in that service area appears as a shaded block. The intensi ty of the shading indicates each government's respective \"investment\" in that service area, with darker shading indicating a higher level of spending.

Expenditures are only half of the local government financial picture. The other piece involves revenue. Where do the dollars spent by the community's local governments originate? This section reviews total revenues received in Onondaga county during 2013, by major category. It should be noted that the countywide sale s tax sharing framework was changed in 2010 for the period 2011-2020. Beginning in 2011, the County started phasing out the previous practice of sharing sales ta x with all local governments. The new arrangement, which covers the 4 percent \"local share\" and the additional 1 percent tax that is subject to biennial state authorization, gives the County 73.6 percent and the City 24.3 percent. 6 Disbursements to town and vi llage governments were phased out between 2011 and 2013. Thus, sales tax revenues shown in the following table for those levels of government are vestiges of the last year of that phase-out process. The actual \"mix\" of revenues varies by level of government. On balance, towns and villages were more reliant than the Count y or City on property taxes. Sixty-six percent of town revenues, and 27 percent of village revenues were attributable to property taxes. Property Taxes (2013) T otal Levy Levy Per Capita County $140.9m Towns $115.3m $357 Villages $21.1m $440 6 School districts share the difference.

During that period, counties were required to include in their budget not only the county share of sales tax receipts (as was previously the case), but the entirety of the amount shared with other local governments. The change resulted in the shared portion appearing as both a revenue and an expenditure ( i.e. outflow) in county budgets. This figure also includes the room tax.
