But there is difference between data take n from State Statistic Department of Georgia and existent amount of animal in really. The number of populatio n in Georgia is such more; Regional meeting on Foot-and-Mouth Disease to devel op a long term Regional control strategy (Regional Roadmap for West Eurasia) Under the FAO project is vaccinated 121 566 cattle and 83 562 small ruminants in buffer zone (during months o f May- July), for which was used trivalent (A, O, Asia1) v accine from ARRIAH produced in Russia (city Vladimir). Prophylactic vaccination also was carried out unde r state financial support in the regions situated near the borders of Armenia, Azerbaijan and to the animals migrating at the pastures of the borders. In the high risk zones (Ka kheti and Qvemo Kartli regions) for the origination and transmi ssion of the disease is vaccinated 265 813 cattle and 546 22 8 small ruminants, for which was utilized trivalent cultura l (A, O, Asia1) vaccine produced in Kirghizia (Altin-Tamir). Georgian National Service has carried out 2008 yea r spring FMD Vaccination in 97-98% of animal from planning a mount. It means that several part of animal is not vaccina ted! Regional meeting on Foot-and-Mouth Disease to devel op a long term Regional control strategy (Regional Roadmap for West Eurasia) Risk Assessment Poor border control: Vet. Control of the ports, ai rports and border-release points is carried out by the relevan t body of the Ministry of Finance that results ineffective vet. c ontrol. The National Service has no sufficient information rega rding the border control; Number of migrated animals: The National Service i s aware of the rayons where animal migration is developed: ani mals migrate between winter and summer pastures. Their r outes are identified and is estimated the possible amount of population. The relevant rayon bodies of the Nation al Service carry out monitoring on migrating animals. Mobile p oints are established for health control on passing roads but local staff of the National Service is not sufficient for carry ing work properly; Regional meeting on Foot-and-Mouth Disease to devel op a long term Regional control strategy (Regional Roadmap for West Eurasia) Migrating animals pass many settled points and the y get in contact with the local animal population tha t increases risk of the disease spreading; Migrating animal illegal trade often takes place w hile scattering them in different settled places. In thi s case veterinary surgeon doesn't check sold cattle that increases spreading of FMD and other disease; Akhaltsikhe rayon (buffer zone) is one of the bigge st live animal market in Georgia where are brought and taken animals nearly from every region. Vet control in this market isn't satisfaction ; Regional meeting on Foot-and-Mouth Disease to devel op a long term Regional control strategy (Regional Roadmap for West Eurasia) Animals contact takes place at the borders of Azerbaijan, Turkey and Armenia and are sometimes used common pastures that includes high risk of animal diseases transmission; Risk factor is also the fact that there is a large amount of wild animals in Georgia. There are lots of mountainous forests where animal migration takes place as within country as outside the country and to control this is almost impossible in Georgia; Regional meeting on Foot-and-Mouth Disease to devel op a long term Regional control strategy (Regional Roadmap for West Eurasia) The risk of introduction of FMD virus from Turkey a nd Iran into Georgia is high, Because of low protectio n expected from the A22 component of the vaccine, the animal population in the Georgia has little effecti ve immunity to this strain and therefore there is a ve ry high risk that epizootic spread could follow introduction; The fact that migrating animals belonging to one rayon are in other rayon territory during FMD vaccination time and some number of animal stay without vaccination that increases FMD spreading risk; Regional meeting on Foot-and-Mouth Disease to devel op a long term Regional control strategy (Regional Roadmap for West Eurasia) While there is no animal Registration and Identifi cation System in the country for vets Is difficult to iden tify vaccinated and not vaccinated animals .e.g. in wint er and summer pastures takes place mixing of animals o f different rayons; Buster vaccination: According to the above mention ed vaccine instruction is recommended to vaccinate animals from 4 month and revaccination should be carried out every 3 month till the age of 18 month. In Georgia buster vaccination doesn't take place and young animals are under high risk; APPENDIX 10 Regional meeting on Foot-and-Mouth Disease to devel op a long term Regional control strategy (Regional Roadmap for West Eurasia) FMD vaccine wasn't properly kept because of the technical problems; in particular the temperature r egime wasn't kept during some period. The mentioned vacci ne was used without checking it that puts effectivenes s of this vaccine under question; The risk of FMD infection is increasing, because s everal part of animal are not vaccinated; Lots of killed animals in the conflict zone (Shid a Qartli, South Ossetia) _ the recent unfortunate facts devel oped in Georgia caused death of large amount of cattle a nd small ruminants, while there is war state it is imp ossible to carry out burring and disinfection process prope rly that is really huge risk for originating and spread ing the disease. Regional meeting on Foot-and-Mouth Disease to devel op a long term Regional control strategy (Regional Roadmap for West Eurasia) Risk Management and Recommendation Rising of awareness among veterinarians, farmers a nd the public; For planning future vaccination campaign it is ver y important to perform animal identification and regi stration in Georgia. These activities should be carried out by the Risk Management and Communication division of the National Service; The public should be made aware of the danger of i llegal trade of animals at this time, and of the need to r eport suspected outbreaks. These activities should be car ried out by the Risk Management and Communication division of the National Service; Regional meeting on Foot-and-Mouth Disease to devel op a long term Regional control strategy (Regional Roadmap for West Eurasia) Vigilant clinical surveillance should be carried o ut and all suspicious cases diagnosed and information pass ed to the reported to the FAO project coordinator; Special attention should be paid to points of incr eased risk of FMD virus spread like the vaccination buffe r zone, border posts, international transit roads, li vestock markets, slaughter points, animal migration roads. The National Service should perform the activities with the Government support; Slaughter points should be implementation of centralized slaughtering under veterinary supervisi on in the shortest period. While animal slaughtering take s place in yards and often without vet. Supervision; Regional meeting on Foot-and-Mouth Disease to devel op a long term Regional control strategy (Regional Roadmap for West Eurasia) Performing animal Identification and Registration System in a very short period is very important. It can support disease control; Border inspection should be increased to reduce il legal animal transportations. The Government should decid e this; Regional meeting on Foot-and-Mouth Disease to devel op a long term Regional control strategy (Regional Roadmap for West Eurasia) The regional FMD situation should be monitored clo sely and FMD surveillance and control activities adjuste d accordingly; These activities should be carried out by the Risk Management and Communication division of the National Service; Corpse of dead animals should be disinfected and b uried in the shortest period in the conflict zone. Curren tly FAO expert group is working on this issue. Strengthening health monitoring in regions for whi ch is necessary addition of vet. Specialists and stronger material technical base. These activities should be carried out by the Government of Georgia on request of the Ministry of Agriculture of Georgia. Regional meeting on Foot-and-Mouth Disease to devel op a long term Regional control strategy (Regional Roadmap for West Eurasia) Strengthen National diagnostic capacities; Maintain an emergency stock of vaccine (FAO projec t and nationally); Conduct regular sero surveys and constant clinical surveillance for monitoring the FMD situation in th e country.
