Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is one of the oldest medical systems in the world and has been practiced in China and other Asian countries for thousands of years. TCM is supported by thousands of years of clinical experience and has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for a variety of illnesses. The primary modalities utilized under TCM are Acupuncture, Chinese herbs, Tui na (Chinese massage), cupping, and diet and lifestyle changes. These modalities promote the body's healing mechanism to treat the underlying cause of an illness and strengthen the body's innate ability to respond to environmental stressors. TCM is effective to treat and prevent acute and chronic conditions. How does Acupuncture Work? Acupuncture works by balancing the flow of Qi (life force) in the body. Qi flow through the 361 acupuncture points and 14 meridians to support health and wellness. An imbalance or interruption in the flow of Qi will result in pain, dysfunction, or sickness. Inserting needles into acupuncture points with appropriate combinations will restore a normal balance, allowing the body to repair and maintain its own health. What conditions does Acupuncture treat? Acupuncture is commonly used to treat pain. However, Acupuncture has much broader applications beyond pain relief. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes the ability of acupuncture to treat and prevent more than 100 common health disorders, including the following: Neurologic and Musculoskeletal Disorders - Trigeminal Neuralgias - Headaches and Migraines - Facial Palsy - Stroke - Peripheral Neuropathies - Meniere's Disease - Neurogenic Bladder (bedwetting) - Intercostal Neuralgia - Cervicobrachial Syndrome - Frozen Shoulder - Sciatica - Low Back Pain - Osteoarthritis - Carpal Tunnel Syndrome - Back and Knee Pain - Fibromyalgia - Chronic Fatigue - Sports Injuries and Pains Respiratory System - Acute sinusitis - Acute rhinitis - Common Cold and Flu - Acute tonsillitis - Acute bronchitis - Bronchial asthma Eye Disorders - Acute conjunctivitis - Central Retinitis Myopia - Cataracts (without complications) Mouth Disorders - Toothache - Post Extraction Pain - Gingivitis - Acute and Chronic Pharyngitis Gastrointestinal Disorders - Spasms of esophagus - Hiccough - Gastroptosis - Acute and Chronic Gastritis - Gastric Hyperacidity - Chronic Duodenal Ulcer (pain relief) - Acute Duodenal Ulcer (without complications) - Acute and Chronic Colitis - Acute Bacillary Dysentery - Constipation - Diarrhea - Paralytic Ileus Reproductive & Gynecological Conditions - Premenstrual Syndrome - Dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps) - Spotting and Excessive Bleeding - Amenorrhea (Loss of Menstrual Period) - Impotence - Infertility - Incontinence - Prostatitis Mental Emotional Problems - Stress - Anxiety - Depression - Insomnia Is Acupuncture Safe? Acupuncture is a safe and effective treatment when performed by a licensed acupuncturist. Our acupuncturist is certified by the National Certification Commission of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (NCCAOM) and licensed by North Carolina Acupuncture Licensing Board (NCALB). At Regional Chiropractor Center, we only use individually packaged, sterile and disposable needles to ensure little to no risk of infection or spread of disease. Appointment Length - Your initial visit includes a comprehensive review of your medical history, a medical intake, examination of tongue and pulse, and an acupuncture treatment. You may also receive an herbal formula, dietary and lifestyle recommendations. - Return visits include updates on progress, reevaluation, herbal formula, dietary and lifestyle recommendations, and an acupuncture treatment. - Please allow for a total of 60 minutes for an initial and return visit. Does It Hurt? Acupuncture needles are very thin and fine, not much thicker than a strand of hair. Insertions of needles are usually painless How Many Treatments Will I Need? The number of treatments you need will depend on the nature of your illness, duration, and severity. You may need only a few treatments or a series of treatments. On the other hand, some chronic conditions may require many treatments or ongoing treatments. Please keep in mind that disease is a process. It took time for your body to become ill, therefore it will take time for your body to heal. Generally speaking, the effect of acupuncture treatments builds on one another. The closer your treatments are, the less treatment you will need and the faster your recovery time will be. This is why 2 to 3 treatments a week may be recommended. For Acupuncture visits: - Be sure to have something to eat or drink before your session - Please wear comfortable clothes that allow easy access to the legs, arms, and stomach. CUPPING Cupping is an ancient healing technique used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to move qi (life force) and blood. It involves creating a suction force to draw blood to the surface of the skin. This suction helps to facilitate the free flow of qi and blood. Cups may be placed on your chest, abdomen, back, buttock, arms, and legs. Cups can be made out of the following materials: - Ceramic - Bamboo - Silicone - Metal The Four Techniques of Cupping - Dry Cupping: stationary placement of cups.Wet/Bleeding Cupping: A technique involving medicinal bleeding using lancet and suction of the cup to draw out the blood - Running Cupping: A method of moving cups in the desired area using oil as the medium - Flash Cupping: A method of quick, repeated suction of cups on an area of the body Benefits of Cupping - Boost immunity - Increase blood flow in the skin - Change the skin's biochemical properties - Increase pain threshold - Reduce inflammation What Does Cupping Treat? Cupping is mainly used to treat pain conditions but may benefit some chronic health issues. Cupping may help with the following conditions. - Headache and Migraine - Neck pain, shoulder pain, back pain, knee pain - Rheumatoid Arthritis - Cough, dyspnea, asthma - Carpal tunnel syndrome - Gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., Irritable Bowel Disease) What is Dry Needling? Intramuscular Manual Therapy (IMT) or Trigger Point Dry Needling (TDN) is a specialized treatment technique that reduces muscle spasms and pain. Dry Needling directs a small, solid filament needle (also used in acupuncture) into the skin and muscle directly at a myofascial trigger point, thus reducing muscle tension, pain/spasm and helping to restore mobility. The needle may be manipulated at this point to produce a local twitch response, which results in muscle relaxation. This is an effective technique for both acute and chronic conditions. We may recommend dry needling when our patient is struggling to return to active rehabilitation and needs to jumpstart the healing process. Dry needling retrains muscles to work with a new and pain-free range of motion, making it a great option for treating: - Neck and back pain - Sciatica - Headaches and migraines - Myofascial pain - Chronic Neuromuscular pain - Sprains and strains - Shoulder Pain - Knee and hip Pain - Joint Pain - Plantar Fasciitis - Movement disorders - Sports injuries - Orofacial pain - Chronic Neuropathic Pain - Many other conditions Our highly trained Acupuncturist is knowledgeable and experienced to administer dry needling procedures, and we will make sure you feel confident about the process well before your appointment. Often, dry needling is used as part of a comprehensive treatment plan in conjunction with other Chiropractic and therapy techniques to promote healing, pain relief, and optimal physical function. What to expect: Each individual who experiences dry needling will describe the process differently, depending on what muscles or tissues are being treated, and the severity or acuteness of injury. Usually, people receiving dry needling attend between 3 to 6 sessions. More sessions may be necessary, depending on the pain and responses to the therapy. Health insurance does not cover dry needling procedures but we have very affordable options. Health Savings Accounts and Flex Spending Accounts can be used. Some common things you can expect to feel during dry needling are: - Dull, achy pain at or near the treatment site - Potential for sudden sharp, sometimes startling, pain (this is expected) - Muscle twitching where the needle is inserted - The twitch is what releases the trigger point in the muscle After dry needling, you can expect: - Soreness in the associated area (like after a hard workout) - Improved range of motion of the associated area, however, it may feel temporarily tighter at times - Bruising (less common) Dry needling is a safe and effective method of relieving pain and tension in muscles and can be used to assist with treatment in a wide variety of conditions. When used appropriately, dry needling can be effective in helping to restore joint range of motion and facilitate better body mechanics, which can also prevent future injury and pain. If you are interested in dry needling or curious if it's right for you, we encourage you to contact our office to schedule an evaluation with our Chiropractic Physician and Acupuncturist. Non-trigger point technique Some dry needling techniques treat a broader landscape of the central nervous system. This is called non-trigger point treatment. Instead of inserting needles only in the area of pain, the practitioner may instead insert needles in areas around the point of pain instead of directly on it. This technique relies on the idea that pain is the result of a greater nerve or muscular issue, not just focused in the main area of pain. This non-trigger point technique is commonly used in our practice because we have an Acupuncturist performing the technique. "}
