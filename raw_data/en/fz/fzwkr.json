Cough or nasal congestion Shortness of breath Fever NEW Sore throat NEW GI symptoms NEW Fatigue NEW Body aches (not related to working out) NEW Loss of Smell or taste What to Expect When You Come In For Treatment: Vaccination All providers in our office are fully vaccinated. Masks The state of Washington mandates that all patients and healthcare providers must wear masks in medical facilities. This has not changed throughout the pandemic. Please come to your appointment wearing a fully protective and well fitting mask for the duration of your time in the clinic. If you cannot wear a mask for a medical reason, please talk with us beforehand to determine the safest treatment option for you and me both. If you do not have one, or it is inadequate, we will provide you with one at no charge. In Clinic.... 1. Please use hand sanitizer or hand wash with soap and water upon your arrival and leaving the clinic. 2. We have open windows in our clinic and we will be making full use of the air flow from outside to reduce our exposure risk. We also have high powered HEPA filters designed for much larger spaces to increase efficiency installed in every room of the clinic. 3. Patients are asked to use a credit card/HSA/FSA card on file to pay which we will set up at your first visit. Please use the on line schedule and credit card saved on file to pay as much as possible to reduce the time of face to face contact. Thank you for your understanding. May you and yours remain safe and well. Do you accept insurance? Rain City Acupuncture is currently credentialed with Aetna, Lifewise, Premera, Group Health, Kaiser, United, BCBS, Regence and many other smaller companies. Please call your carrier to see if you have coverage. We also accept cash, credit card or check. We will happily grant you a superbill to submit to your insurance for re-imbursement if you are out-of-network. Please check with your carriers to make sure you have out-of-network coverage for this. Can I receive acupuncture if I am pregnant? Yes! Acupuncture is very useful in the treatment of morning sickness, insomnia and the discomforts that are often associated with pregnancy. Chinese medicine is also a great natural way to promote fertility health. Will I see results right away? Yes, most patients experience some results right away. However, more chronic issues take longer to treat. For most conditions, we recommend at least 8-12 treatments, once per week. Some patients choose to come every week or every two weeks for overall health maintenance. If you have an acute condition, we may recommend two treatments per week. Your acupuncturist will give you a treatment plan after your first visit. How do I prepare for my treatment? Wear loose, comfortable clothing for your treatment. We will provide you will scrubs to change into if needed. It is important to eat before your treatment, even if it's just a snack, especially if it is your first treatment or you are a diabetic. Please do not come on an empty stomach. Some people feel a little sleepy or dazed after the treatment, so do not plan on a heavy work out after our treatment. Does it hurt? Acupuncture needles are hair thin and generally do not cause pain. A slight prick may be felt on the insertion, but this usually fades away and most people do not feel anything. Some experience a heaviness or pressure around the point. Others feel a heat sensation while laying on the table. Most people fall asleep during treatment and describe it as a relaxing experience overall. "}
