He's an immigrant to the United States from Iraq and the founder of Ideas Beyond Borders, a nonprofit dedicated to promoting critical thinking, science and civil rights in the Middle East region. (Program transcription forthcoming) Faisal Saeed Al Mutar on the Campbell Conversations Joe Lieberman Program transcript: Grant Reeher: Welcome to the Campbell Conversations. I'm Grant Reeher. My guest today is former Senator Joe Lieberman. He represented Connecticut in the United States Senate from 1989 to 2013. He also served in the Connecticut State Senate and as the state's attorney general. In 2000, he was the Democratic Party's nominee for vice president running on the ticket with Al Gore. He's here with me today because he's the founding chair of No Labels, a centrist political organization that's behind a possible third party unity ticket for the 2024 presidential race. In a past program, I interviewed Brian Clancy, the chief strategist for No Labels. So, Senator Lieberman, thanks so much for being here. We really appreciate you taking the time to do this. Joe Lieberman: Glad to do it, Grant, and thanks for your interest in No Labels. GR: Well, it's a fascinating idea that you folks are putting forward. And so I've got, as you imagine, a lot of questions about it. Let me just start with the most basic one, is, please remind our listeners who may not remember the conversation I had with Brian Clancy, remind our listeners of what the Unity Ticket Project is and why it was created. JL: Will do, and I'll give you a really quick history of No Labels. So, No Labels was founded by a woman named Nancy Jacobson, incidentally, a Syracuse University graduate who had spent most of, really pretty much all of her career working for Democratic organizations and candidates. And then in 2009, probably particularly after she watched the very partisan reaction to the financial collapse of 2008, she just decided maybe it was time to start a bipartisan organization or an organization that would try to bring some kind of bipartisan centrism and unity back to Congress. And that's how No Labels was started (in) 2010, worked hard over the years since then really to elect centrists Republicans and Democrats to Congress and then to get them working together with each other and colleagues and the other chamber. And I'm very proud of what we've done at that and really been at the bottom of some of the, unfortunately rarer accomplishments of the last years in Congress including the infrastructure bill and the CHIPS innovation bill and some of the COVID stuff. So what about the Unity Project for 2024? In a way it's a surprising development, but honestly it comes out of the, really the thoughts and the opinions and ultimately the requests of our members around the country who said we're never really going to bridge this partisan gap in American politics. All the disunity, a dysfunction, failure to solve our problems, unless we have a president who will lead that effort. And so we decided, you know, it's too early to say whether there's really an opportunity to run a ticket, in our case it would be a bipartisan unity ticket next year. But just to keep the possibility open, let's start a major effort and it's not easy to qualify a third line for president or vice president in each of the 50 states. That's what we're doing, we're over ten, we think we'll definitely get over 20 by the end of the year, and it's going to be a really credible movement. And then next year we're going to see is there something constructive we can do? And just briefly, Grant, we've said we'll only run a bipartisan unity ticket if we believe it has a realistic chance to win. And I know what we say that people say, well, that's ridiculous, third parties don't win. In fact, the third party hasn't won since, of all people, Abraham Lincoln in 1860. What if you look at public opinion in America today, almost half the American people identify themselves as independents, just a little more than the cumulative (unintelligible) say I'm a Republican or Democrat. People are turning away from the two major parties because they feel like they don't do anything to deal with the things that people worry about at home. They just fight each other. And the second thing we've said is that we will only run a ticket if we're not spoilers. And by that I mean that we're not just, that we have no chance to win. Also, that we would take disproportionately from one of the two major party tickets. And of course, we're talking about a bipartisan unity ticket. Really, well, the last time it happened, it was 1864 with Lincoln and Andrew Johnson. But, because it will be a bipartisan ticket, we think that it will take equally from both parties. So that that's what we're about. I mean, just a poll in the last couple of days, almost three quarters of the people say they don't want President Biden to run again. Almost 70% say they don't want President Trump to run again. And to us, that's the message to the two parties. But if they don't hear it, we may just decide to give the American people a third choice after Trump and Biden next year. GR: Well, I wanted to ask you about the decision to run the ticket and to follow up on something that you said, because it's obviously, I think barring any catastrophic health issue, it's going to be the case that Joe Biden is the nominee on the Democratic side, it's an open question who's going to be the nominee on the Republican side, but Donald Trump is the frontrunner, at least based on the polls. So is your decision, your organization's decision going to be based on the fact that these two, the idea that these two candidates are deeply unacceptable to a lot of people? If, for example, a moderate Republican candidate were able to get the nomination, I imagine your thinking might change, is that right? JL: Yeah, no question about it, our thinking would change. I mean, look, part of this is that we were, the two parties are seem to be heading toward nominating two very unpopular candidates for president. And I think part of their unpopularity is what No Labels is all about, which is that the people understand that a Trump Biden campaign will be just the typical partisan slash counter slash campaign. And then most troubling of all, whichever one of them is elected doesn't really hold any hope of a different four years in which both parties sit down, talk respectfully, compromise, and actually get something done to solve the problems that people worry about, like the economy, inflation, crime, cultural changes are America's role in a very different world. What do we do about China? What do we do about Ukraine? This stuff slides down and it really becomes a party against party, tribe against tribe, enemy against enemy. That's not the way the country gets any better. So yeah, if there was a surprise and one or both of these candidates, if Trump and Biden were not nominated and there were some more moderate or independent nominees, I think that would have a real effect on whether we would run a No Labels ticket. The odds are we probably would not, I have to catch myself, and Nancy always reminds me, No Labels can't run a campaign. We are working very hard to get on the ballot in all, for a third choice in all 50 states. But then, we will recommend a ticket, a bipartisan ticket, but then that ticket has to qualify under the federal election laws. And we can't, we're a nonprofit corporation. GR: Right. You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher, and I'm speaking with former United States Senator Joe Lieberman. So the obvious question is, how is this effort being received by the two parties so far? JL: Yeah, well, not well... GR: (laughter) JL: Particularly not by the Democrats. And it's not surprising, Grant, because we are challenging not just the two candidates, Trump and Biden. Really, what No Labels is doing in talking about a bipartisan unity ticket is challenging the political status quo in America which the Republicans and Democrats control, and that's threatening to them. There's a professor at Harvard, Michael Porter, who describes the two parties control over American politics as a duopoly, not a monopoly, but that they have a kind of, even though they fight each other and tear each other's face off, they have a ground on which they agree, which is let's keep it just us. And we're trying to break down the door and get in there where I think a majority of the American people want us to be. Now, the Democrats have reached, or some of them have reached some kind of conclusion that the inevitable result of a bipartisan unity ticket, the fourth on the No Labels third line will be to elect Trump. But I don't get that because as I said, it's going to be a bipartisan ticket. We think it'll draw equally from both parties as Ross Perot did in 1992. And we keep saying over and over again, we're not going to be spoilers. We're only going to do this if we think we have a realistic chance to win. Let me (unintelligible) with the latest data where I think we have a realistic chance to win. We just completed, No Labels, a poll of almost 10,000 voters in the eight swing states, which have pretty much decided the last two presidential races. And if you ask people if their choice is Trump, Biden or a moderate independent choice. 63% said they're open to a moderate, independent choice. Now, I understand that's open too, ultimately there's got to be some names up there that they have to like. But that really tells you that, and it's coming from both parties. So we basically said to people in both parties, including most of the Democrats are really attacking No Labels, just relax a little bit here. GR: (laughter) JL: And incidentally, maybe what you should be thinking about is whether the two candidates you've got, Biden and Trump, are really the strongest candidates for you to be running. And maybe that's the response you should give instead of attacking us for somehow trying to break down the door of this two party duopoly in American politics. GR: So I wanted to ask you a question about the Democratic Party's resistance to your effort, because I think it's fair to say, at least since 2016, that one of the main central messages of the Democratic Party is that they are the party of small-D democracy. And they're standing up for small-D democracy. Do you think the party's behavior toward you folks undermines that claim? JL: I do. Thanks for asking that question. When you think about it, what they're saying is the Democrats who are trying to stop No Labels, you don't really have a right to try to get, or maybe you have a right but we don't think it's a right you should be able to exercise to try to get a third line on the ballot to get access to the ballot. Incidentally, there are Supreme Court decisions, particularly beginning with efforts to stifle civil rights groups that say that gaining access to the ballot is a constitutionally protected right. So, I always say and I have said in the last few months to the Democrats who are attacking us, you have every right to disagree with what we're doing and to say so in strong terms. But when you do what we've seen them do now in Arizona, Maine, and to some extent North Carolina, which is to convince Democratic election officials, state officials to use their power to try to block No Labels getting out a third line, even when we satisfy every legal requirement. We put in enough legal signatures of all the rest, that really is unconstitutional. And I said this once before and they really got angry at me. It's actually potentially a crime because the law says that two or more people cannot conspire to deny other Americans their constitutional rights. And that can be a crime under our criminal code of the United States government. So I think the, look, I understand what the Democrats say when they say they're the party of democracy because Trump has done things that certainly seem anti-democratic, but in this case, the Democrats themselves in trying to stop us from doing what is our constitutional right to get on the ballot, to run a third unity ticket, to give the American voters a third choice, that's unconstitutional. Really, in a way, it's the kind of voter suppression, which, of course, Democrats always oppose, rightfully, because it's often used to try to suppress minority voters who are likely to be Democratic voters. GR: You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher, and I'm talking with former United States senator and founding chair of No Labels, Joe Lieberman. And we've been discussing No Labels' possible sponsorship of a third party effort in the 2024 presidential elections called the Unity Ticket. So, before the break, we were talking about the Democratic Party's pushback against this effort. I wanted to ask you a little bit more personal question about that, if I could. I mean, this is your party, after all... JL: Yeah. GR: You know, you ran in a presidential race under this label. So, are you disappointed at a personal level or do you just kind of chalk it up to, well, this is politics, this is the way things work? JL: No, I am disappointed, although I must say I've had greater disappointments with the Democratic Party over the course of my career. But if you would have said to me that I'd end up in this place advocating for at least the possibility of a third party ticket for president or vice president next year, I wouldn't have believed it. But it's just based on what I've seen. I mean, when I said I had tougher moments, you know, in 2006, I ran for reelection to the U.S. Senate and basically I lost the primary, was close, but I lost it. And, you know, it was based on the Iraq war which I understood. It was a very difficult decision, difficult for me, I was obviously not being opposed to our retreating from Iraq because although it would help me politically, but I thought it was the right thing to do. And I was disappointed that so many Democrats that I had helped over the years, and then I had advocated on behalf of other issues, turned away from me. And people kept quoting to me the Ronald Reagan line, that because you started out as a Democrat, where he said, I didn't leave the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me. But I will tell you that I, even when I ran as an independent in Connecticut, and thank God and the voters of Connecticut I got reelected, I never left the Democratic Party, I still am a registered Democrat. But, you know, I've been disappointed by it. And this really slash and burn reaction of some Democrats toward No Labels' exploration of a third party bipartisan unity ticket has been disappointing to me. But I feel very strongly that what we're doing is the right thing and it doesn't deter me at all. I mean, maybe it's because I'm now out of office and I'm not really thinking about the next election. GR: (laughter) JL: I'm trying to see if there's some way at this stage and chapter of my life I can contribute to the betterment of the country. And I really think that this is one of the ways. GR: You've addressed the issue of this ticket being a spoiler and that the ways in which you're trying to build into the process that you don't do that. If you don't mind, I did want to ask you, though, a question about the 2000 election in that regard... JL: Sure. GR: ..as I have you here and I can't resist. JL: No, go ahead. GR: And so you and Al Gore ran for president and vice president in 2000 against George W Bush and Dick Cheney. A lot of Democrats blamed your loss on Ralph Nader's third party run that year, he was the spoiler. Do you agree with that? JL: Well, you know, I'm not sure. And I know it's a funny thing to say. The exit polling in Florida suggested interestingly, surprisingly to me, that Nader took, pretty much equally votes that would have gone to Bush-Cheney or Al Gore and me, hard to believe that but for different reasons, different kind of voters. But there's no question Nader had an effect, I think, in states like New Hampshire too, where, you know, it was so close in 2000 that if we had carried New Hampshire, Al Gore and I, we would have been elected. Just that few, I think they have four electoral votes, maybe even three, I think four, they have four. That would have been enough to have won the election. But here's the difference, Nader was always a spoiler. He was a, if you will, a protest or ideological candidate to put it in more positive terms of being a spoiler, which is to say that nobody, including Nader, thought he had a chance to win. This is a big difference because as I said earlier, Grant, if No Labels runs a bipartisan unity ticket, it is because to the best of our ability, we believe it has a realistic chance to win. And based on the data that we're getting now, we think if we come up with the right candidates, that we can do that. I mean, when you think about it, you've got those eight swing states that I talked about earlier. 63% of the people say they're open to a moderate independent ticket. Most states in America or their electoral votes, almost all except two, on a winner take all basis. That means that our ticket could carry a state with 35% of the vote. GR: Right. JL: And right now, I'd say that's quite feasible. Considering the attitudes, the really negative attitudes toward Trump and Biden. GR: Yeah, the other thing I would just say editorially is Al Gore is not Joe Biden, and certainly George W. Bush is not Donald Trump. If you've just joined us, you're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. And my guest is former United States Senator Joe Lieberman. Even more sensitive question, if I may, I'm going to ask some different questions now... JL: Sure, go ahead. GR: Based on my reading of the 2000 election, my understanding is that you were one of the folks in the campaign's inner circle that was advocating that Al Gore continue his challenge of the election outcome beyond what he did. And you can correct me on that if I'm wrong, but if that's right, I'm just wondering whether you've rethought that moment given what we saw in 2020. JL: Yeah, no, both are right. GR: (laughter) Okay. JL: I'll tell you the story briefly. So it was on a Friday in December of 2000 that basically our side won the case in the Florida Supreme Court, we thought it was over. And then the Bush campaign asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case, which we never thought they would. There was no precedent for it, basically because, and it was sort of brought up, again, you might say, around the Electoral College this in 2020, that these are state law questions. Anyway, the case was argued the following Monday in the Supreme Court and on Tuesday night about 10:00 or 10:30, Al Gore called me and said he had just heard from our lawyers that the Supreme Court had ruled in favor of Bush. And he said that he was disappointed, he knew I would be. But he said the lawyers had told him that there was language in the Supreme Court decision that arguably, as we say in the law, enabled us to go back to the Florida Supreme Court and ask for a recount of the votes statewide. What did I think? So I said, you know, Al, I haven't seen the decision so I'm going to react based on my own experience, particularly as Attorney General of Connecticut, but also which is, if you think you have a plausible chance on appeal, which this would be, and particularly if our lawyers are right, that the US Supreme Court has said of Bush V. Gore, that we have a right to go back to the Florida Supreme Court, there's so much on the line for our country, I would say that we should do it. So he called me back, it was after midnight and he said, I made a decision and I'm not happy with my decision and you won't be. But I think we've got to end this because if we go to the Florida Supreme Court, it's highly unlikely that a statewide recount would be completed by January 20th. Therefore, we will not have the orderly transfer of power, according to the Constitution. And, you know, I accepted it, of course, with a respect. As I look back at it, particularly having gone through 2020 and President Trump's refusal to accept the results, refusal to accept the fact that he lost, I think, 60 or 61 court cases to try to overturn the election, I think Al Gore probably took it to a higher level than I was as a former attorney general and he did the right thing for the country. So that's my story today. GR: We've only got about another minute and I want to squeeze in one more question if I can. And it's a simple one that it was going to be difficult to answer in less than a minute. But, do you think within the two parties, not your Unity Party ticket ever, but within the two parties, there is still room for moderates to emerge as leaders? JL: I hope so. I mean, I can tell you that in our No Labels work in Congress, we really have helped to elect the centrist. A lot of Democrats and Republicans in Congress are, you might say, the biggest victims of the partisanship, because they worked so hard, they come to Congress and then they get pushed into these warring camps. So, that's why we have 60 members of our House Problem Solvers caucus equally divided between Republicans and Democrats. Ten in the Senate and they work together and they get a lot done. Could they become leaders? I don't know yet really, because both parties are still dominated by the more extreme ideologies. But I'll tell you this, I'm an optimist and I think the public is so fed up with the political status quo and the two major parties that there's going to be an uprising. Remember, Thomas Jefferson said he thought it was a good thing for there to be a little rebellion in American politics every so often. As important as storms in the physical world are, in other words, clear out the dead wood basically. GR: (laughter) JL: I think we may be at that point right now in American politics. GR: We'll have to leave it there. I could talk to you for hours, but Senator Lieberman, thanks so much for this, it's really been a thrill for me to talk to you. I remember when you first ran for U.S. Senate against Lowell Weicker and it's going to be an interesting year politically, to say the very least. So thank you. JL: It is. Thank you, Grant. Take care. GR: You've been listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media, conversations in the public interest. (Ellen Abbott) Program Transcript: Grant Reeher: Welcome to the Campbell Conversations. I'm Grant Reeher. Last week, we heard from Bill Kinne, a Democrat who's running for Onondaga County Executive. This week, my guest is the man he's trying to unseat, the Republican incumbent, Ryan McMahon. County Executive McMahon has held the office since 2018 when he was appointed to the position following six years as the chair of the Onondaga County Legislature. He was then elected as County Executive in 2019. This is his first run for reelection to County Executive. County Executive McMahon, welcome back to the program, good to see you. Ryan McMahon: Good to see you, thanks for having me, Grant. GR: Well, thanks for making the time, we really appreciate it. So I'll start with the same question that I started with Bill Kinne, your challenger, and that is, how would you describe the current state of the county? RM: Well, quite frankly, it's exciting. And when you think about what's going on, there's never been more economic opportunity on the horizon for members of this community. And this didn't happen by accident. There's a lot of thoughtful planning. There is a lot of calculated risk on my administration's end of things. But we really took the lessons we learned during the pandemic. When you're intentional, when you come together as a community to work towards a common goal, and we took those experiences and we moved those forward in a post COVID recovery strategy and plan, where we made a lot of local investments and because of those investments, and then the partnerships that we built, we have companies like Micron coming here. Largest economic development project that the country has ever seen. And this community needs validation and sometimes we do, we're hard on ourselves. Micron Technologies is making their biggest bet, the greatest memory technology company in the world is making their biggest bet in their company's history on us. And they chose us over Austin, Texas. They chose us over Phoenix, Arizona, Raleigh, North Carolina, Grand Rapids, Michigan. And then in addition to that community, in a site that would have sat between Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Chicago, Illinois. So just think about that. And when you look at other strategic wins that we've had, creating economic opportunity, you know, we talk about what's happened with Amazon over 2500 new jobs, we put that deal together. When you look at what JMA Wireless is doing with 5G manufacturing here in our city's South Side, again, that was a deal that we helped put together with our partners at the city of Syracuse in New York State. Lotte, right? Bristol-Myers, you know, Lotte is coming in, maintaining those jobs, adding more people and more investments so that campus can be restored and to be a powerhouse in biologics again. So it's not just in one area what we're seeing and again, how you get these companies here is a commitment to your own people, commitments to your own community, to build neighborhoods, to build workforce partnerships, to invest in people, to invest in kids, to invest in seniors. And we had to tell our story to get Micron to make this commitment and it worked. So we're ecstatic to be here. And now it's about making sure that we deliver and we execute on this opportunity in front of us. And a lot of that is community based planning, nuts and bolts planning. A lot of that is workforce development, supply chain strategies and then obviously getting the White Pine Business Park mega site ready for construction next year. GR: So would it be fair to say then, because one of the questions I wanted to ask you was what accomplishments in your administration you're the most proud of so far? And so based on what I'm hearing, it would seem to me that it would be at the general level, it sounds like it's economic development. And at the most specific level, it's the Micron Investment. Is that fair to say that those are the things that you would think of if you had to pick the jewels in the crown, so to speak, that that's what they would be? RM: Yeah, I think I think it's hard to say that there's ever been a time where we've had more economic opportunity. And I think if you look at this, Grant, if you look at our first two years, what I'm most proud of is the way our team handled the global pandemic, where, you know, we led the day to day regional public health response to 100 year pandemic. And I would say this at that pandemic didn't happen, many of the lessons learned there, we never probably would have implemented and Micron likely would not have happened. And so one of the things that I know that you're keenly aware of is that when we started to build out the White Pine site from a 300 acre site, which there's many 300 acre sites across the country, into a mega site of over a thousand acres, every time we would make those necessary investments to have a shovel ready mega site, we were criticized. There was editorials written about us. There's three famous editorials that ran about us, telling us that this was a waste of money and these are pipe dreams and nothing will ever happen. Literally, nothing. You know, we were criticized with this, but we knew what pressure felt like because of the COVID pandemic. And when you're dealing with life and death every day, when you're dealing with desperation, whether it's because people were sick, they didn't want to get sick, to maintain your medical infrastructure, the economic desperation that people went through when businesses were shut down or limited and they couldn't pay their bills. That's pressure. You know what's not pressure? Is criticism from political adversaries and at times the media. Because we had a tested approach to what we wanted to do, we put together a post COVID recovery strategy, recognizing that one of the key lessons, the key lessons that we learned during COVID was we cannot depend on foreign supply chains in this country. Whether it's for personal protective equipment, whether it's for medicine or what we saw on the horizon with semiconductor manufacturing, because of what is going on the global stage with China and Taiwan. So we knew we had this asset but it had to be ready, and we took the risk to turn White Pine into a mega site. And we see those very much connected with COVID. It was the key piece of our COVID recovery plan, and that allowed us to play. And as you're aware and we've talked about, it wasn't just Micron we were talking to, we were talking to numerous semiconductor manufacturers. We just got the best project there was on the marketplace. GR: You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher and I'm speaking with Ryan McMahon, the Onondaga County Executive. So those are all the good things. What would you regard as your biggest frustrations or missed opportunities for the county so far? RM: Yeah, I think when you when you go through things, the speed of things. Even when you're in charge to implement things, I think is something that you underestimate, you know, the rules and regs that you have to follow. I do think that certainly this year, counties overall were very, very frustrated because the state government is intercepting, possibly illegally, our E-FMap Medicaid funding. So we weren't successful as county governments trying to get the state legislature and the state not to do that. That's going to impact us greatly in the county. That's about, in the state budget our county will be hit for about $14 million of lost revenue and increased costs because of that. So in a way, that's a that's a failure on our part for not advocating or getting the public engaged enough on that. But again, New York State's - $14 million out of our budgets, $14 million that's just drained from the local investments and people and workforce and important initiatives here. But overall I think, stylistic at times, I'm a hard charging executive and stylistic at times. Maybe I could have been softer on the legislature with some of my initiatives and, you know, helped go through their process a little bit better. And, you know, I learned from that. And I think overall, part of the reasons why I'm hard charging is at times during COVID when I was more diplomatic, I shouldn't have been. And when we're talking about getting kids back for in-person learning, you know, I was being loud, but I really should have been louder. And I look at that because now we're dealing with a situation with kids, mental health issues off the charts. But we have innovative programs we've developed to address these issues. But, you know, at times I was being more diplomatic and speaking to power in Albany, I probably should have been harder. And then at times, I was probably a little too hard on some of my own initiatives. GR: I wasn't planning on asking you about this, but when you say you were too hard on some of your own initiatives, then I'm assuming you're talking about the aquarium is one of the things or not? RM: Yeah, I think overall we put forward a post COVID recovery strategy at the same time as the aquarium, which included White Pine and included historic investments for Lead funding and mental health and I gave the legislature a lot at once. But time was of the essence for us to meet this opportunity. And certainly I probably could have been a little bit softer with my approach to the legislature, more of a stylistic thing. I think from a policy thing, you know, we believe in the policies and we believe in all the initiatives and most of them have paid great dividends already. GR: So your Democratic challenger, Bill Kinne, is running on a message of, and this is a quote from his website, restoring integrity to the office and the county. And I asked him about that because it seems to suggest a pretty deep criticism. And he pointed to, as a specific, the change and county legislators having to go through your office in order to communicate with different department heads in the county. And so I have two questions for you about his remarks. The first one is, is what he described as the way that legislators now communicate with department heads, is that correct? And if it is correct, why was the change made? RM: There is no change. Legislator Kinne, he's been there for a long time and he's not accurate. He's never been in a leadership position. As you recall in the introduction, I was the chairman of the legislature and so I can tell you, with my predecessor and working with County Executive Mahoney, there's a government relations team that we would work through and there's deputy County Executives that you work through. And they are in the financial world, the facilities world, and then the human service world and that's the way it's done. The legislature can use the committee process. Remember, I ran that branch of government and bring over departments at any time to get updates on things, but the way that it should work and does work and worked under the Mahoney administration and the McMahon administration and likely the Pirro administration before us, I just never interacted with the Pirro administration. From a legislative side of things is we had government relations people and their job is to work with these legislatures on the issues that are impacting them. And the deputy county executives are there to work with the legislative branch of government. And again, the committee process is a process that any department can be called over to talk about any initiative or any issue moving forward. And our department heads go over and do that, so, it's just a situation where, you know, maybe legislator Kinne, because he has never been in a leadership role there, didn't know protocol before, but that's been protocol ever since I've been in county government. GR: And so also, let me just ask you a second question. I'm just going to ask you flat out, is there an integrity problem in the county executive's office? Because he seems to be suggesting there is. RM: Yeah, I don't understand what that is. Again, I think overall, legislator Kinne can he's having a difficult time trying to tell people that this community is not on the right side, moving in the right direction. And so you have to come up with slogans and certainly that's the one he's tying himself to. GR: You're listening to the Campbell conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher and I'm talking with Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon. The Republican is running for reelection this November. So I want to come back to Micron, ask you a couple of more specific questions about that. And the first one is paraphrasing the ancients, John F. Kennedy once said, \"Victory has a thousand fathers but defeat is an orphan.\" So, the Micron investment... RM: Yeah. GR: ...and again, just to remind our listeners, if they don't know what it is, mega complex for chip manufacturing. It was certainly a huge victory for the region and indeed the state, you and I have talked about this before and a lot of folks are claiming at least partial parenthood of this development. So how much, just bottom line question, how much of the credit do you think you should get? RM: Oh, there's a lot of things that happened in this process that if they didn't go a certain way, you probably may not receive the investment. But the reality is, is again, we went through site selection processes with the greatest technology companies in the world: Intel, TSMC, Micron and others. And there's three things that happen that they look at, the first is site. If you don't have a site that they can do what they need to do, they don't even look at your state. Then they go in deeper dive, okay you have the site. And again, there is about five or six of us in the country that had the site and my administration put this mega site together. So my administration put New York State in the game and there's no arguing that, Senator Schumer would tell you that. The governor would tell you that, Empire State Development would tell you that. Then the second focus is the community, right? Do you have the partnerships to develop workforce? Higher education, right? So, without Syracuse University and all these higher ed partners, we can't tell that story. The quality of life in the community, the investment. Two big comebacks that we talked about, the cleanup of Onondaga Lake. That's when our comeback in this community started was the cleanup of Onondaga Lake and then the downtown revitalization. You know, there's lots of people that had parts of those, right? So in the community, we're telling the community story, right? Did Ryan McMahon have something to do that? Sure, but so did thousands of other people. And then it's about incentives, right? Being competitive locally, incentives. I directed the local incentives, right? I can get criticized for that, but we made ourselves the most competitive. And then the State of New York, the State of New York needed to be competitive. Governor Hochul got through Green CHIPS. So with Green CHIPS, the State of New York is not competitive. So the governor needs credit for that. Then the federal legislation, right? Without the CHIPS act, you're not seeing this activity because that's going to offset the difference between building here and Asia. So for sure, Senator Schumer was a Goliath in this process, John Katko important in this process, because the progressives on the left, we're not going to vote for the CHIPS Act, so the moderates on the right had to have their back to position this. And certainly the President of the United States signed the bill and supported the bill. So, Grant, there's so many people and so many different things that happened to your point. Now, your second part of that quote is very important. If we did not get a project, what you would be talking to me about today is you're running for reelection, you invested $70 million to get a site shovel ready and there's nothing here. Those editorials that they wrote about you were correct right? So the failure only would have had one author and you're looking at it. GR: Interesting. Well, speaking of those editorials, the other question I wanted to ask you about this is the Post-Standard dinged you a little while back for a county video about the Micron investment, they said it was too self-promotional. Do you think that was a fair criticism at the time? RM: Yeah, not really. But I get it and I get it's an election year. So the reality was that video was done last year right after the Micron announcement to tell the story of White Pine, right? And White Pine's story was not just Micron, that's the end of the White Pine story. And it talked about all the partnerships that made it necessary. But with economic development and site selection, leadership matters in a community. The alignment of leadership in this process mattered to Micron with the state, local and federal working together. And that's the White Pine story and this community should celebrate the White Pine story. And there's no way to tell the White Pine story without the role that my administration had. And so I get it became political fodder. Look, if you're trying to unseat us, you know, ironically, the same people who criticized me about the Micron video were the same people who voted against the funding to do the White Pine mega site. So they're trying to hide the fact that they did not support this initiative and this project in the beginning. It's always easy to have friends once you've landed the largest project in the history of the United States. We love having those friends now, but we really love the friends that were with us in the beginning that believed in the vision and the plan that we put forward. GR: So one concern, though, about the Micron investment is that it will further, what is already a crunch on affordable housing, especially in the city. And I've been asking lots of different guests on the program about this in the last year. Do you think there are things that the county in particular could do to help avoid this becoming a real problem? RM: Yeah, there are some things we are doing. And so remember, a lot of talk on site selection process, getting the project here. Now it's all about execution, right? So we're executing on the site itself, we have teams working on that. We're executing on the workforce partnerships, we have teams working on that to maximize the job creation opportunities for the community supply chain. But also we're really implementing in our comprehensive plan, the first comprehensive plan that the county has had in 25 years, Plan ON(ondaga) which is a really big deal and the timing couldn't be better. And housing is a key piece of that. So, what we're doing is we have created a situation where we are updating and we are funding all these other municipalities' comprehensive plans and their zoning rules are part of that process. And so updated zoning in some of these communities that are going to experience growth will help with housing tremendously. In addition to that, we have what we call our O-CHIP program, which is essentially, if you think about, it's GAP funding to get some of these projects online for new housing units. We have not historically had a housing issue in Onondaga County except for the last two to three years. And so there hasn't really been a strong economic driver for the private sector to come in and invest for more housing because the business opportunity wasn't there. Now it is and Micron's driving that. So in the updated comp plans, updated zoning, our O-CHIP funds are bringing new units online, many of them affordable unit projects and senior projects, many of them in the city of Syracuse. We think this will all help, but for housing you need market drivers. And so now we got a really big anchor tenant coming into town. We are seeing private money come in that we haven't had before. We're seeing projects like Great Northern Mall really start to come to fruition, it will be big town center project. With the aquarium going to the inner harbor that's driving more density and we think that's going to drive more housing. And then projects like O-CHIPs are going to go into neighborhoods throughout the community and those hard projects to get done that need that GAP funding, O-CHIPS is going to help fund that. So we understand this is an issue, we've already taken action on it and we think we're going to make good progress on it. GR: If you've just joined us, you're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. And my guest is Onondaga County Executive Ryan McMahon. So when you ran for office four years ago, you emphasized three things and they're still on your website today. That's poverty, infrastructure and economic development. I'm curious to know in a second term, would you be adding to those themes or will they still remain the three things that we'll be seeing on your website four years from now? RM: Yeah, those are our guiding principles because they're all connected. And when we do them well, we have great results, and I think we've seen that with what's going on. Again, workforce is always a key issue for these companies. That's one of the key issues is as important as financial incentives. So you have to invest in people and you have to remove barriers to employment. We've done that with childcare, increasing the ability to make it affordable for people, but also working on increasing the infrastructure in the childcare space. And that's something that's going to be key for Micron moving forward. That's going to be one of our key focuses moving forward. Child care and the infrastructure is a barrier to employment, specifically for women. And in addition to that transportation, we made key transportation investments. That's going to be key moving forward, making sure our rapid transit isn't just something that's going to happen in the city of Syracuse, which it's going to in 2026, but also that we have employment rapid transit systems. And we need to be aspirational about transportation moving forward as we're going to be a growing community. Workforce development, we are investing in workforce development programs left and right and the county-wide STEAM school is coming online, a workforce development laboratory for our kids. 60% city kids, 40% suburban kids coming together to get trained for the jobs that are here now, tomorrow. OCC, we're building a clean room at OCC so that we can train technicians for Micron in the semiconductor industry. These are all key things that we have to do to execute moving forward. Infrastructure, we're going to make more investments in infrastructure, whether it's modernizing our roads, but our sewers to continue to create capacity so that we can build neighborhoods in a smart way. And also we can continue to support the companies that are here but the companies that will come here. And when you have workforce and you have infrastructure, you get the jobs. And we've seen that with Amazon, we've seen it with Lotte, we've seen it with JMA, Micron. And trust me, Grant, we are talking to dozens and dozens of supply chain companies that are going to co-locate with Micron. And again, one of the things with Micron, we're not talking about 5,000 construction jobs, local trades, local companies, New York state companies. But we're going to be hosting construction workers from the Northeast, from the Pacific Northwest, maybe even the world in certain specialties, right? That's going to be an economic boon for our hospitality industry as well. So these are all things that are going on. But our PIE platform, as any of my department heads will tell you when we go through a budget process, if there is a new investment that's being made, how does it fit into the PIE platform? How are we getting people prepared for the workforce? Because the way out of poverty is a job and a career, not a government program. GR: So you mentioned the county's leadership and your leadership during the COVID pandemic earlier. And I did want to ask you a question about COVID, because it looks like it's poised to make a comeback this fall. Just as an example, I just got an email from my primary care doctor's office telling me that because of the recent uptick, they are going back to a mask mandate for all patients coming in. So they're making a change about this. Are you concerned about what you're seeing and some of the numbers that are coming in in the last few weeks and months? RM: Yeah, we've learned a lot with COVID and with each variant that comes through, and COVID is here to stay. And so what we need to do is really watch the data. The goal of everything is always about your medical infrastructure, making sure you can take care of all your sick, not just those who have COVID. And so what we'll do, is we're going to give the best guidance based off all the information that we have. And certainly as more and more vaccines become available, we will certainly get that information out to everybody. But we don't see a county wide mask mandate coming in. We will give the best information to people and let people make the decisions that are best for them and their families. GR: So we only have about 30 seconds left or so, but I wanted to give you at least a short opportunity. Is there anything that I haven't asked you so far about your reelection campaign? RM: Yeah, one of the things we didn't talk about is our fiscal record. We've had five straight years where we had balanced budgets and we delivered county surpluses. We paid for major infrastructure and major entertainment infrastructure projects with cash. We've cut the county tax rate to the historic low and while other governments have been raising taxes, we've cut taxes and we've made government more efficient. And I have a budget presentation in two weeks, and I want you to follow it because I think people are going to really like what we have to say. GR: All right, great, we'll look for that. Thanks much, we'll have to leave it there. That was Ryan McMahon, County Executive McMahon, thanks so much for taking the time to talk with me as always. And I want to wish you safe travels on the campaign trail. RM: Thank you, Grant. GR: You've been listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media, conversations in the public interest. Program transcript: Grant Reeher: Welcome to the Campbell Conversations. I'm Grant Reeher. My guest today is Bill Kinne. He's the Democratic nominee for Onondaga County executive in this November's elections. Legislator Kinne is currently an Onondaga County legislator representing the 15th Legislative District, having served in that capacity from 1992 to 2011 and then again since 2020. He's the owner of Bill Kinne Property Management Services which performs snow removal, lawn care, landscaping, caretaker and handyman services. Legislator Kinne, welcome to the program. Bill Kinne: Thank you Grant, it's very nice to be here. GR: Well, it's great to have you here. So, let me just start with a very basic question about your sense of Onondaga County right now. How would you describe the current state of the county? BK: Well I think we have some severe issues in this county. You know, we have a mental health issue that's really across the whole country but we're seeing it here, you know, unfortunately for people shooting each other, but other reasons. You know, I think we need to work on infrastructure. I think we're just doing patchwork. We're not dealing with the infrastructure for the future. And I think it's time we change that. GR: Okay. And let me ask you now about the incumbent, because, you know, every challenger obviously is making the case that the incumbent should not be returned to office. So what initiatives or decisions that were taken by the current county executive, Ryan McMahon do you do you not approve of? BK: Well, there are several. The aquarium obviously. I mean, it used to be that the Republicans were the fiscal conservatives and they would watch the budget. This administration seems to throw that out the window and just spend money crazily for an aquarium. Also, he wants to get rid of the jail up in Jamesville Penitentiary. I think that's a public safety issue that he's on the wrong side of. I also don't like the fact that he spent $6,000, or close to it, on making a video of himself claiming that it was to promote Onondaga County. But he finally got it off the website because he was getting so much feedback. I mean, it was clearly just a promotional video for himself and not the county. GR: Yeah, I wanted to probe a little bit on that last point and see if you would want to expand it, because I was looking at your campaign website and, you know, your main tag line, one of them is you want to restore integrity to the county executive's office. And I wanted to probe a bit on what you mean by that. Is that an instance of what you're talking about? BK: That's one clear instance what I'm talking about, yes. Another one is that when I was a legislator from 1992 to 2011, if I wanted to talk to a department head, I could do that. Since Ryan's been in charge, you're not able to do that. And I think that's fundamentally flawed and does not serve the taxpayers. As an elected official, I ought to be able to talk to a department head or anybody in county government and find out what's going on. He likes to control things to protect his whatever, I don't know, protect his, you know, his feelings. I don't know. But he's a control person and I'm not like that. I believe in listening to people and them telling me no, if I need to hear that word no. He obviously doesn't believe in that. GR: So, two things that I wanted to follow up on from that. The first one is, what then is the current practice, let's say as a county legislator, you want to talk to someone in county government. What's the practice now? Do you make an application or what? BK: No, you have to call the deputy county executive that's in charge of that department and talk to them. GR: I see, and then go through them. Are you, though suggesting, and so I just want to make very clear, are you suggesting, though, that the county executive and the county's executive office is at this point corrupt? BK: I don't know (if) corrupt is the right word. I think they are not serving the public well by that policy. I mean, and I don't want to get into rumors, there's all kinds of rumors out there about things, but I'm not talking about the rumors. I'm talking about the things that I see every day. There's no reason that any person that's elected, no matter what legislator you are, Republican, Democrat, doesn't matter, you shouldn't have to go through the deputy county executive. You should be able to talk to the department head and get the real sense what's going on. GR: I want to come back to the two things that you mentioned, that you think the county needs to pay more attention to, mental health and infrastructure and see what you want to do about that. But let me just stick with the incumbent here for another minute or two, and then we'll get into your vision for how things should be different. But are there things that Ryan McMahon do you think has done well in his time as county executive? BK: You know, that's a hard question to answer. He did work hard to get the land for the Micron deal. GR: Okay. BK: Got to give him credit for that. The Micron deal, though, was not because of Ryan McMahon, the Micron deal was because of President Joe Biden, Senator Chuck Schumer, even Congressman Katko when he was in office. Governor Hochul, most of the reason we have Micron is because the Democratic leadership in this country. Ryan got the land, he did good with that. Other than that, that's the only thing I can think of. GR: I think in some ways you're circling back to that video that you mentioned before when you're when you're delineating things to get credit for regarding Micron. BK: Yeah. I mean, look, it's one thing to be pragmatic, it's another thing to be proud. I prefer humbleness in a person rather than pride. And especially if that person is not telling the whole story for the whole county government. GR: One of the things that the county executive, Ryan McMahon was in the media almost constantly for, obviously was the COVID pandemic when it was at its height. And he did get, from some quarters, praise for his leadership during that. How would you assess his leadership during the COVID pandemic? BK: I would have to give him fairly high marks. I mean, I thought being on TV all the time was a little bit over the top. And I think it affected his health, but that's for his decision to decide. But, you know, again, we had a lot of help from other people during COVID, which we needed. But overall, I got to give him high marks, although I have to tell you, I had a doctor approach me that disagrees with that. And I wasn't able to get into the reasons why. But I hope to next Monday because I have an appointment with his doctor, see what he what his rationale was. GR: Okay. You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher, and I'm speaking with Bill Kinne. He's a Democratic Onondaga County legislator who's running for Onondaga County executive this fall. So now getting into to your record and things that you want to do, what accomplishments during your time as county legislator are you most proud of, the things that you think have made the most difference for the county? BK: Well, the thing I'm most proud of is my constituent service. And I've helped people not only in my district, but in several other districts that I know of for a fact. I mean, I believe in public service. I believe that you're there not to help yourself, but to help the people that elected you. So I'm very proud of that. I'm proud of the fact that when we were building the new jail downtown, I was the person behind getting, at least, build the extra foundation for the fourth tower if we needed it. The reason I'm proud of that is because at the time we were being told that the jail wasn't big enough. So I thought, (unintelligible) spend the money, let's spend it when it's going to be less expensive and get that fourth foundation in. And, you know, even the Republican legislators agreed with that, so that was done. Thankfully, we haven't had to build it, but if we do, the foundation is there. And I'm not a big person on getting recognition for things, I'm just there to serve the people. And I was away on vacation last week and I got a call from someone who doesn't live in my district that had an issue and I was able to help them. So I people know that I'm out there and I help, so I'm grateful for that. GR: So you mentioned at the outset of our conversation the importance of mental health and infrastructure and that the county needed to do more on that. And I want to explore those two things with you. Before I do that, I just want to make sure, because you also mentioned the jail and you just mentioned it again, make sure that I'm absolutely clear on what your position is. So you would want to keep the two facilities that currently exist, rather than combine them into one downtown, correct? BK: Absolutely correct. GR: Okay, all right. And so let's go back to mental health and infrastructure. What are the things that the county, if you were county executive, that you would want to see being done or new initiatives that would help that situation of mental health in the county? BK: Well, it's my understanding from people I've talked to that we are extremely short of mental health workers. Psychologists, social workers, extremely short. I would like to see the county, with the state, if we can get them to buy into it, but if they can't, just the county. I'd like to see some type of program that we help people that take that field up at Syracuse University or LeMoyne and get involved in that field and stick around the county for a period of time, whether it be, you know, five years or ten years some frame of reference that we might reimburse them for their college experience, college cost. I mean, we need people. People need help for whatever reason, this COVID situation certainly has made the situation a lot worse and we need we need people to fill that role. And if we're short those workers, we need to find a way to get them to come here and be those workers. GR: So, similar in some ways to some of the programs that are out there for teachers to stay in a certain area, it sounds like what you're saying then. BK: Yeah, absolutely. Maybe at the time that the county had to step in, I mean, we have a tremendously large surplus. Maybe it's time to dedicate some of those funds to helping get new people to stay in the field and in live in Onondaga County. GR: So you also mentioned infrastructure, and I wanted to probe on that one. And just as a backdrop, when Ryan McMahon first ran for county executive, he had three things he said he was going to emphasize and it's still on the county website today which is poverty, infrastructure and economic development. So you've got mental health and infrastructure. What should we be doing more about infrastructure that we're not doing, what aren't we paying attention to? BK: Well, one of the problems I have with infrastructure is the way it's been handled since I've been in office and probably before that as well, I'm sure. We do piecemeal fixes. There doesn't seem to be a long strategy, a long plan. Everywhere I go, people are complaining about the roads, they're complaining about the bridges. We spend a lot of money on the sewer system, which we have to, there's no question but we're spending it all at the metro plant and the main facilities. We're not fixing the pipes that run throughout the county. I mean, two years ago, I received several phone calls from constituents that had sewage in their basements. And in one of the particulars in Geddes, the county's known about this problem since I found out (in) the early 90's or maybe possibly the late 80's, that the pipe is not the right size. And yet the county still wants to patchwork this. I think sometimes you have to bite the bullet and replace things. You know, we're putting a lot of homes in the town of Onondaga which is good for the county, good for the town, but that sewage goes down, doesn't go up, it goes down to the valley, it goes down into Geddes. And maybe we need to rethink how we're dealing with that. I just feel that we're doing in such a patchwork, like we're going to build this great pipeline out to Micron, which is needed, I get it. But what about all those people that have been paying taxes for years and years and have sewage in their basements and are going to have trouble selling their houses because of that? I think we need a better overall plan and be upfront and tell the taxpayers what we're doing and why we're doing it. GR: You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher, and I'm talking with Onondaga County legislator Bill Kinne. He's a Democrat who's challenging Ryan McMahon for County Executive this November. So, Micron has come up a couple of times in our conversation and the first half of the program, and this is the enormous investment by the company on building a mega complex for microchip manufacturing. Obviously a huge development for the county and the entire region. And it's something, I'm sure that the current county executive is going to be emphasizing on his reelection bid. And you in the first half of the program did give him credit for acquiring the land for that. Now that development creates enormous opportunities for the region, there's no doubt about that. But it also perhaps creates some challenges and maybe the infrastructure issue that you were talking about is one of those. But I wanted to get your sense as what you see as the opportunities and the concerns and challenges that that come from Micron's investment in this area. BK: Well, the opportunities are going to be, you know, wonderful for, I think, everyone. Good paying jobs, so there's no question about it's going to be good for the county, good for the whole region. But are we going to be prepared to handle all the extra traffic, all the underground piping, you know, what are we doing, the amount of water they're going to be using? We have to find a way, I would hope we find a way to treat that and reuse it if we can. But I don't think the county executive is so caught up in just talking about how great Micron coming is, I don't believe from what I've seen, there's a good overall plan for what we need to do for not only Clay and Cicero, but other areas of this county, that, you know, these people are getting someplace to live. We have a severe housing shortage. Sure, if the people out there who are making $100,000 a year they can probably afford a $500,000 home or $300,000 home. But what about not everyone is going to be making $100,000 a year? And we have problems right now with people that are making, you know, $60,000 a year that can't find housing or even a decent apartment for a reasonable price. So I mean, I don't believe he's given enough thought into what's going to happen in the county as a whole. GR: Does the Micron Development, this is right on the point you're making, but does the Micron Development change any of your thinking regarding what should be done regarding I-81 o,r perhaps more to the point, the redevelopment of the area underneath it right now? Because that, up until Micron, that was the big development story for the area. Now it seems small in comparison to this, but I wonder if it has implications there, do you think? BK: I think it has some implications, but look, this 81 has been in desperate need of repairs for years. They're doing patch work on that. The bridge needs to come down. That's what the plan is and those people that want to try to build a bridge or whatever, I understand their thinking, I don't particularly like the good plan, but that's what the state wants. The experts say it'll work, I'm not an expert, so I have to take them for face value. But it will create opportunities. We have space, we should be able to do something with that space and hopefully have a better connection between the community and the university and the hospitals. It would seem reasonable to think that's what would happen, but it'd be nice once both projects are done. But that's going to take quite a few years before they're done. GR: Yeah, well, we also talked a little bit before about COVID and the current county executive's leadership during COVID. It looks like now, unfortunately, it's getting ready to resurge. There's some evidence that this is already happening. Are there things the county should be doing about that now that it's not doing? BK: Well, I'm not a health expert whatsoever, and I would hope that the county executive is in communication with our head of the health department, who's a very qualified and a good health director. You know, I just I'm not on the health committee I haven't seen anything about it. But I got to believe that they're talking and getting things ready. That's what I would do if I was in charge. I would be working with the experts and getting ready and trying to be ahead of the game instead of them behind you playing catch up. GR: If you've just joining us, you're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media, and my guest is Onondaga County executive candidate Bill Kinne. He's currently a legislator in the Onondaga County legislature. So my next question we could be talking for hours about, but unfortunately, I'd like to ask you to try to keep your answer pretty succinct. But as long as I've been living in Syracuse, for over 30 years, it seems like the thorniest question has been what's the proper relationship between the city of Syracuse and the county, and what is the county owed to the city and so on. What's your take on this? What's the proper relationship between the city and the county? BK: Well, it's been a thorny issue ever since I was old enough to remember. I humbly disagree with some of my Republican counterparts who I like. They could care less about the city, they tell you that privately. I believe that you need a strong center in the city, the city has to be the strong center of the county, and there should be a better relationship. I was hoping that since the present county executive and the present mayor were on good terms, that things would change. They haven't changed, at least not as far as I can tell. Some people think that the city gets too much, which I find mind-boggling because, you know, look at all the tax exempt property that we have in the city, all the county buildings, LeMoyne College, Syracuse University, all the hospitals. I mean, people are using the services of the city, and we've got to find a way to treat the city better, in my opinion. Look, the city has responsibilities and they have to deal with those responsibilities and they may need to make some changes, too. I'm not giving them a free card here. There's issues that need to be addressed as far as I'm concerned, and I hope, if the voters elect me, I'll have a chance to sit down with the mayor and talk to him about my concerns and talk to him about his concerns, how the county can help. But those people that think the county would be better without the city, I think are sorely misled and not thinking correctly. Because you need a strong city to survive. And if you don't take care of the problems that the city has, those problems are going to come out to the county eventually. I think we've already seen some of that and some of our next door neighbors. I love the city, it's not perfect, but we need a strong city. I could have moved out of the city many times. I chose to stay in the city, it's where I grew up. I love the city, but we got problems and I think the county has to step up to the plate and help address some of those problems. GR: And one of the things that occurs to me that kind of underlines your point is, it seems to me combining some of these things we've been talking about, that the folks that are likely to work for Micron are going to be probably pretty interested in the city in a lot of ways. And a lot of the younger ones are going to want to live there. So I think those issues probably are going to only become more important. BK: I agree. GR: Yeah. And so I want to circle back, though, with thinking about the city and the county to something you mentioned at the outset, at the very beginning of our conversation, when you mentioned mental health. You mentioned gun violence and people dying from that. Is that more of a city issue or is that something that the county needs to be more involved in as well, do you think? BK: I think the county has to be involved. I mean, first of all, the city taxpayers are county residents, okay? Secondly, we all should be concerned about people dying. I mean, it's just not right in this day and age that we say, oh that gets killed in the city that's the city's problem. It's just not right. I mean, unfortunately, I've known a lot of good people who I like, but want to, you know, give up on the city because of the violence and other reasons. Yeah, we could give up, but eventually the county would suffer. Might not be in two years, it might not be in four years but it would be down the road and we'd all regret that decision, I believe. I think that we have to deal, one of the main things that the county can help with, in my opinion, is police services. There's got to be a better way for the Syracuse City Police Department and the Onondaga County sheriffs to work together. It just seems unnatural that the sheriff's office has their hands, what appears to be have their hands tied by certain policies. I certainly, if I'm fortunate enough to get elected, would try to work with the mayor, Toby Shelly our sheriff and the chief of police. I'd like to work (with) the towns and villages. We need to have a cohesive plan to provide better services for everyone so that everyone feels safe. Whether you live in Pompey or you live in the city of Syracuse, you're live in Cicero, if you're going to come downtown, you want to feel safe. GR: We've only got about a little over 2 minutes left, but I want to try to squeeze two last questions in if I can. The first one goes back to the relationship between the city and the county. And I'm going to make it even a little bit more touchy, if you will. And that is, do you think that given some of the wealthy suburbs that are in the county, you know, you mentioned $500,000 homes earlier, for example. Do you think that those areas have any special obligations to the city that they're not fulfilling right now? BK: You know, I don't think so. I mean, at least I can't think of anything. What I would tell them is that you elect representatives that should serve no matter where your district is, should serve the whole county. I've served with some legislators who I like personally, but if it didn't affect their district, they didn't care. I think that's a terrible, terrible attitude. I think if you're an elected official, you should care about everyone, especially if you're a county legislator and the county executive. You've got to look at every part of the county. I believe there's a lot of those people that have those $500,000 homes or $300,000 homes that live outside the city that come into the city to work. So it would seem to me it'd be in their best interest to want the city to be, one, safe to travel, safe to get out of your car and walk to the shopping center or to a restaurant or to your office. You know, they should take that in consideration. So, as far as special interest, I think it has to be a common interest, a human interest. GR: And we've only got a few seconds left, and so I apologize for that, but I did want to leave you at least some time. And you're going to make this just a couple of phrases or two but is there anything else about your campaign or about you that I haven't asked you yet that you want our listeners to know about? BK: Just the fact that I really believe in public service, you know, helping people is what this should be about not making yourself rich or special or popular. It's about helping people. And as an executive, that's what I would try to instill in my all my staff and that's about it. GR: Well, that's a nice note to leave it on, we'll leave it there. That was Bill Kinne, Legislator Kinne, Thanks so much for taking the time to talk with me. And I want to wish you good health for you on the campaign trail, I know it's a stressful thing to do. BK: Well, that's very kind of you, Grant. Thank you. I'm working hard, but I'm not killing myself. GR: Good, all right, you've been listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media, conversations in the public interest. Laurence Jurdem Program transcript: Grant Reeher: Welcome to the Campbell Conversations. I'm Grant Reeher. My guest today is Laurence Jurdem. He's a historian and writer and is currently also an adjunct professor at Fairfield University and Fordham College's Lincoln Center campus. He recently published a new book titled, \"The Rough Rider and the Professor: Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge and the Friendship That Changed American History\". Laurence, welcome to the program. Laurence Jurdem: Grant, thanks very much, great to speak with you. And as a former Syracuse University graduate, it's particularly wonderful to have the opportunity to chat about the book. GR: Well, that makes it even more exciting for me to talk to you about it, so that's great. So, let me just start with a really basic question, and that is how did you get interested in writing this book at this moment in time? LJ: Well, I you know, this book came out, I guess, as the people, some people in the publishing industry have referred to it, it's a, \"COVID\" book. And I, as so many of us, were locked down in 2020, I'd always wanted to write a commercial book. I had written an academic book, which was the publication of my dissertation about the influence of several conservative magazines on the foreign policy of President Reagan. But I really see myself at heart as a storyteller. I want to reach as many readers as possible. I know there are so many people who love history, love a great story. And I found myself as one who was loved presidents from the time I was a little child. I thought, I loved the idea of friendship and camaraderie among men. And I thought, well, who was Theodore Roosevelt's closest friend? And I kept seeing, you know, Henry Cabot Lodge. And I read, of course, Edmund Morris's wonderful trilogy and I thought Lodge just isn't mentioned very much. And when I was going through the notesin Morris's first volume, \"The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\", he made mention of a book called, \"The President Makers\", which was written back in the 1940's and makes the argument that Henry Cabot Lodge was essentially responsible for catapulting Roosevelt much quicker up the political ladder than he otherwise would have been. And I thought, what a fascinating idea. And so I thought, well, this could really work. And of course they have these, this incredible relationship, which also is intimated in the correspondence they had between 1884 and 1919, which encompasses about 2500 letters. So I thought, wow, nobody's really ever done this and what a great idea it could be. GR: It's interesting. And so we'll get a little bit later in our conversation to how this friendship changed American history. But I want to ask some more sort of personal questions first. And the first one is, so how did the two people, how did these two persons meet and become friends in the first place? LJ: Well, they had known each other, I think periodically. They both were graduates of Harvard. They both were members of the Porcellian Club. Lodge was about seven years older than T.R. When T.R. was at Harvard he would frequently be in the Porcellian Club, Lodge would be there. Lodge was teaching a course on colonial history. He was not the most scintillating academic, as I think he initially started out with fourteen students, ended up with four... GR: (laughter) LJ: ...there were no student evaluations then. And they may have met again when Roosevelt married Lodge's distant cousin, Alice Lee. But they really came to know one another out of the tumultuous convention of 1884. Both men were, one could say, liberal Eastern Republicans. They were very much focused in the belief that virtue, honor, integrity were the underlining qualities that a president must have in order for them to inhabit the office. And James Blaine, who was a very dynamic character of the 19th century Gilded Age, was someone who was going to be the Republican nominee and Lodge and Roosevelt were determined to prevent that from happening. Both were elected by their respective states, Massachusetts for Lodge, New York for Roosevelt to go to the convention in Chicago. And they soon took up a friendship and ended up essentially trying to work together to dislodge Blaine from the nomination which they unfortunately failed to do. And that's kind of where this friendship comes out. There was a great deal of failure at the end of that convention for both Lodge and Roosevelt. Lodge and Roosevelt decided that, as they believed their duty was to vote for the nominee since they had been voted in by their constituents, they voted for Blaine. Both were politically ambitious men, particularly Lodge, who was running for Congress at the time. And once Blaine lost that election, the liberals on Beacon Hill, who Lodge had been friends with for his whole life, turned their back on him. And not only ostracized him from Boston Society, they also worked to make sure he was defeated in that first run for Congress and Lodge never forgot that. Roosevelt, who had lost his wife and mother that year, retreated into the natural world of the West of the Dakota Territory, uncertain if he would ever enter politics again. But out of this turmoil comes this extraordinary friendship where both men really try to mine the best that are in each one of them to rise to some sort of political prominence. And that's really what the book is about, after the convention of 1884. GR: And so, friendships are about a lot more than getting something out of them, obviously. But I did want to ask you, one would have the impression from what you just said I think that it was perhaps Roosevelt who benefited more from the friendship than Lodge did. Is that fair to say? LJ: I don't think so. GR: Okay. LJ: Henry Cabot Lodge was a very intuitive man. He would have been a wonderful political strategist today. He was a very strategic thinker, he was very aggressive. He knew everyone who he needed to know or wanted to know in the political arena, particularly in Massachusetts. And there was something about the young Theodore Roosevelt that he took a shine to. Something about that dynamism, that energy, that intelligence, that curiosity that Lodge didn't really possess. He was a very formal man, a very introverted man, a man who really didn't like people very much. He was not a natural politician. Many people said that when Lodge got up to talk, he had the voice that sounded like the tearing of a bedsheet. And Lodge himself actually said that he sounded like a dentist's drill. And if you go online, and there is a brief audio clip of him speaking about the League of Nations, that's really what he sounds like. He's like, (wavering) \"I want to say...\" and it's just, you know? GR: (laughter) LJ: But they both had a lot of mutual interests and even then in 1884, Lodge believed that Roosevelt, to coin that famous phrase from T.R.'s cousin FDR, had a rendezvous with destiny. Very insightful and very prescient and just, Lodge was determined to do everything and anything he could to get Roosevelt up that political ladder as quickly as possible. GR: You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher and I'm speaking with Laurence Jurdem. He's a historian with a new book out titled, \"The Rough Rider and the Professor, Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge and the Friendship That Changed American History\". So, Roosevelt was known at the time as he became more well-known, as a proponent of a physically strenuous life. And there's a there's a famous picture of him at Harvard, I think he's a freshman where he's shirtless, sitting there with his arms crossed, and he looks to use the language of today, he looks positively ripped. I mean, he's impressive by any standards. Did Lodge also partake of that type of life, that a thing that they shared? It sounds like maybe they didn't. LJ: They did in a way. Both men were very competitive, they were both great sportsmen, Lodge in fact, taught Roosevelt the joys that Roosevelt came to have about fox hunting. And this was not fox hunting in the leisure sort of way that one might think of it. Roosevelt, as we know, loved danger. And the faster he could ride and the more precarious the path he was on during that fox hunt, the better. In fact, there was one incident where Roosevelt was riding, I believe, out in Long Island, near his home in Sagamore Hill. He took a very, very bad fall, and he crushed his arm, cut up his face, and he basically wrote Lodge something to the effect, well, I'm always willing to pay the penalty if I have a good dance. And while most people would have retired from this sort of thing, Roosevelt's like, bring it on, it doesn't matter. And so Roosevelt just had so much energy and Lodge was also a very good rider, perhaps a better rider than Roosevelt. And the two would ride together through Rock Creek Park in Washington, Roosevelt rode with Lodge. In fact, he rode Lodge's favorite horse, Toronto, which was a beautiful black stallion. And he rode it at East Point at Nahant, which was Lodge's, very much his sanctuary, very much his happy place where he could go skinny dipping. Probably one of the few times Lodge was ever as transparent as any politician could be. And they just were very sporty and had a lot of stuff in common. They both wrote history, they both loved living well, they both loved literature. And for whatever reason, Henry Cabot Lodge was just enormously comfortable and adored Theodore Roosevelt. GR: And you mentioned something about this a few minutes ago, but they became friends at about the same time that Roosevelt went to the Dakota Territory to live a life on the frontier as a rancher. And that followed the death, and you mentioned mother and wife in the same year, I believe it was the same day. LJ: Same day, literally minutes apart. GR: Yeah, and it crushed him. And Roosevelt wrote later that he wouldn't have become president had it not been for that experience on the Dakota Territory. So I was just wondering, was Lodge involved in that enterprise out there in the West in any way with Roosevelt as a backer or a partner or anything like that? LJ: No, but I think what happened there was Lodge and Roosevelt began exchanging this incredible correspondence where they were writing two to three letters to one another a day. Lodge wrote more letters to Roosevelt then than Roosevelt did to Lodge. And Roosevelt was out there enjoying the natural world, riding, going on cattle drives, writing to Lodge about how he had found a couple of horse thieves and had rounded them up. And there was just, this was a difficult time as you say for Theodore Roosevelt, this lack of confidence had really kind of eroded a little bit with all of these disappointments. And Lodge kept saying to him, you know, you're terrific, you'll be back. And Roosevelt did the same for Lodge because Lodge had lost this race for Congress. Roosevelt had left Dakota to go and campaign for him in Massachusetts, a race that Lodge lost by only a few votes. Generally, those liberals who had broken away from the Republican Party to vote for Grover Cleveland, and they voted for the Democratic candidate in that respect as well. But this was really a period where this friendship starts to develop and starts to mature. And Roosevelt is there enjoying the West while also saying, Gee, maybe I can come back, maybe I can make a new start. GR: You're listening to The Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher, and I'm talking with Laurence Jurdem. He's a historian and the author of a new book titled, \"The Rough Rider and the Professor: Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge, and the Friendship That Changed American History\". All right, so the big question, Laurence, suggested in your title, how did this friendship affect or change American history? LJ: I think it changed it in a couple of ways. As I said at the beginning, Theodore Roosevelt, who was a very gifted man on so many different levels, as we know. Intellectually, he had a photographic memory and audio-graphic memory, just a man of remarkable intelligence and drive and ambition. I have no doubt that he would have been president at some point because as you go through the man's career ,and the constant frustration that he has with all the different people he works for, including Benjamin Harrison who he calls a little cold blooded toad at one point, he basically, the presidency was the only job he would have really been happy in. But Henry Cabot Lodge, who had this extraordinary, as I said, strategic mind, this marvelous list of contacts and this incredible networking ability. He really pushed Roosevelt up that ladder to make him president far quicker than he would have ordinarily. It was just under seventeen years or so after Roosevelt first entered politics in 1882. And Lodge convinces Roosevelt against Roosevelt's judgment to take the vice presidency. And he literally writes after Roosevelt accepts the vice presidency and is complaining about how miserable he is, Lodge literally writes a letter and says, nobody can predict what will happen in four years. And that's as prescient as you can get. The other thing was their mutual belief, Lodge and Roosevelt's mutual belief in American exceptionalism, in the belief that the United States was a nation that was blessed by God to spread its ideas through the world. And this is really this idea that Lodge had been talking about a long time about expansion. The West, as we know, was gone by this point. And the only other way to expand for the United States was abroad. And Lodge believed we needed to expand in the Pacific. We needed a large canal going from Central America out into the Pacific. And he positioned Roosevelt, of course, becoming assistant secretary of the Navy, and eventually both men through cajoling William McKinley and others to the U.S. is able to acquire Hawaii, Spanish-American War successful in acquiring Puerto Rico and Guam. And that's really, I think, how that history was changed. This incredible drive by both men to achieve greatness for the United States. And they really believed the U.S. was a great nation and should be a leader in the world because of that. GR: Interesting. And of course, every friendship has its ups and downs. What were the big strains in this friendship? LJ: Well, Lodge was someone who always wanted to have... I mean, both men were very self-centered in a way. Oftentimes, their marriages would suffer because of this. Lodge was always determined to have his own way. When Theodore Roosevelt actually wrote a note to a friend of his and said, you know, when Cabot is a great guy, but when he gets something in his mind, you're not going to be able to dislodge him from it. And that was very much initially with the vice presidency. Roosevelt really didn't want it, his wife, Edith Roosevelt, was desperately concerned that if her husband was idle for any period of time, depression would set in, he'd become argumentative, he'd become difficult. And she believed if you stuck him in the vice presidency, which at the time was this kind of gilded cage, his life would just, his energy would just fade out. Lodge actually got into a disagreement with Roosevelt's sister Bamie, who also really disliked the idea of her brother taking the vice presidency. And Lodge literally said to her, you know what, you're out of your head. And she threw him out of her house in Washington. And they were actually great friends, remained friends for her entire life. And then as we move into the presidency, there is a change in the tide, a changing of the guard, as I refer it to, where Roosevelt no longer is desperate for Lodge's counsel. He would no longer write, dear Cabot, I need this, I need that, if you know someone who can help me with this or that. Roosevelt has the presidency. There was even a moment, in fact, where a journalist came up to Roosevelt soon after he occupied the office and he said, you know, Mr. President, we're all wondering, how are you going to deal with your relationship with Senator Lodge? Because we all know how close you are and is he going to have kind of a carte blanche to the White House? And Roosevelt looked at this guy and said, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. Lodge does not run me, I run him. And I think there was this underlining tension, there had always been this. Roosevelt had always been the junior partner. In fact, there was this joke that went around Washington where it was the firm of Lodge and Roosevelt. And Roosevelt, by making that comment, I think sent a message to everybody saying, I'm president, I make the decisions, nobody else does. And then there were just moments where Lodge was very much the politician, very much dependent on patronage for his state, kept trying to push Roosevelt to do certain things and I'll tell you one anecdote. There was a moment where Lodge wanted Roosevelt to write a proclamation for the hundredth anniversary of Brookline. And he wrote Roosevelt a letter asking him to do this and saying, in fact, oh, I told so and so you're going to do it. And Roosevelt writes back and says, my dear man, don't ever ask me to do something like that again. I get people asking me this all the time, I don't need to hear it from you. And Lodge writes back and says, oh, I was only kidding. Now, Grant, this was a man with no sense of humor. So the fact that he said he was only kidding and about patronage in politics, no, he was clearly taken aback by this, you know, this kind of push back of Theodore Roosevelt. And then there were also issues about where they stood politically. As we move through the presidency, Roosevelt becomes more progressive, he's not listening to Lodge as much, he's listening to people like James A. Garfield and other individuals within his cabinet who have a more progressive bent. And it's really irritating Lodge because he knows that Roosevelt is irritating the big money men who are conservatives in the Republican Party. And Lodge is terrified that the Republicans are going to lose their majority and it's going to be a disaster for the country. So Lodge is always playing defense, he's always trying to tell Roosevelt to calm down. And he goes to people, and forgive me for using a phrase that I think was attributed to, about President Trump, where people about President Trump would say, well, look, don't listen to what he says, watch what he does. And that was the same thing that Lodge communicated - T.R.'s bark is a lot worse than his bite. GR: If you've just joined us, you're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. And my guest is the historian Laurence Jurdem. So today, I think Teddy Roosevelt is perhaps most positively remembered as an early conservationist and for his foundational role in preserving public lands and establishing national parks. Was that an interest that was shared between him and Lodge, or was that something where Lodge viewed that as too progressive using that public money in that way? LJ: I never really came across anything about that. I would think that that was something that they shared because, as I said, Lodge loved going to his retreat and Nahant, which is a very kind of rustic, rural place where he could spend tons of time alone. It was a marvelous place where he could enjoy solitude. And I suspect that he shared Roosevelt's love of the outdoors, nature, I think he was unhappy about how rapidly things were moving along in terms of industry, in terms of the decline of morality. And he very much, I think, in his own way, Henry Cabot Lodge believed in this strenuous life idea. He encouraged his son, Bay Lodge, to go with T.R. on a tour of Yellowstone rather than attend his first semester at Harvard. So I think Lodge very much shared T.R.'s love of the outdoors and the rural environment of the natural world. GR: We've only got about four or five minutes left or so, but I want to try to squeeze in three questions, if I could. And the first one is about Lodge. The Roosevelt name is quite well known, I think to most of us, Lodge, much less so, outside of political historians, I'm more aware of a later Lodge. But remind us of the political legacy of the Lodge family following the Henry Cabot Lodge that you write about. LJ: Well, it is interesting because I think if you look at Henry Cabot Lodge Junior, who was a contemporary of John F. Kennedy's and served in the Senate for quite some time, was defeated by obviously, by JFK in a very famous Senate race. Lodge senior got to know Lodge Junior very well. They spent a lot of time together because Henry Cabot Lodge liked to boast that when he graduated Harvard, he was the youngest man to be married in his class. He was the youngest man to have children in his class, and he was the youngest man to have grandchildren. And they spent a lot of time together. And I know from what I've heard, (unintelligible) Junior was very protective of his grandfather's legacy. But if you look at any video clips of Henry Cabot Lodge Junior, he's very conversational, he's very relaxed, he's got a sense of humor, he's certainly very approachable. Everything his grandfather wasn't. And both men, Lodge in his own way, Henry Cabot Lodge was an internationalist. I know he's tarred as an isolationist, but there is a, he was unhappy with the League of Nations, not because of the idea in itself, but the fact that the United States was going to have a subservient role in it. And Lodge and Roosevelt believed the United States should lead in anything it does and obviously, Henry Cabot Lodge Junior was a tremendous internationalist. But both men shared this idea of noblesse oblige, you know, much is given, much is expected in this role of public service in American political life. And I think that was the legacy of the Henry Cabot Lodge Junior chose to follow. GR: And this next question, it's a big one, but if you could just take it briefly so I can ask you the one last one I really want to squeeze in. But this one is, you know, this friendship, as you already mentioned, had its ups and downs. And one question thinking of today's polarized times is, does this friendship have anything to say to us about keeping friendships across political disagreements? LJ: Yes. In fact even during 1912, which was really when these two men had their falling out, Lodge literally wrote Theodore Roosevelt after T.R. had become super progressive had advocated the recall of judges, something Henry Cabot Lodge absolutely couldn't stand. He said, you know what, because of our friendship, because it's so important to me, I'm sitting out this primary. And that shows you that friendship is more important than politics. And certainly that's something we can learn today. GR: Yeah. And my last question is, you write that there friends up until Roosevelt's death in 1919. Did the two of them have a chance to say goodbye to each other before that happened? And what was that like? LJ: Yes and no. You know, we don't know really what it's like. There was no notes that were taken on the last visit that Lodge made to Roosevelt, who was in Roosevelt Hospital, they sat together. We do not know what they talked about. We could imagine what they talked about in terms of history, the League of Nations was probably a huge debate, but Lodge looked forward to returning and spending time with Roosevelt once he was released in the hospital and he was going to be back at Sagamore Hill. Lodge had been there many times and loved the energy of the place. He loved all the children, loved all the animated behavior. And unfortunately, the only time he got back to Sagamore Hill was for the funeral. GR: And so there wasn't a moment where Roosevelt, in a sense, everybody knows he's going to die and you're having that last that last goodbye then, he didn't have that opportunity. LJ: No, but his sister, one of Roosevelt's sisters, wrote Lodge and said, you need to get up here because he's very, very ill, and so Cabot did. Corinne Roosevelt Robinson, who was T.R.'s sister, also a good friend of Lodges and Nanny Lodge, encouraged Cabot to get up there and spend some time with him. GR: Well, we'll have to leave it there. That was Laurence Jurdem. And again, his new book is titled, \"The Rough Rider and the Professor: Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge and the Friendship That Changed American History\" and it's a great story. Laurence, thanks so much for taking the time to talk with me. LJ: Thanks, Grant. It was a great pleasure. GR: You've been listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media, conversations in the public interest. Robert Frye( prweb.com) Program transcript: Grant Reeher: Welcome to the Campbell Conversations, I'm Grant Reeher. My guest today is Robert Frye. He's a longtime film and news producer with many documentaries to his credit and an extensive resume as a producer for ABC News and other outlets. He's also a product of the Syracuse area, having graduated from Fayetteville-Manlius High School. He's here with me today to discuss his new documentary film on the threat of nuclear arms and ways to mitigate it titled, \"In Search of Resolution\", which airs on PBS channels beginning in August. Bob was previously on the program to discuss the first of the movies in that trilogy titled, \"In My Lifetime\". Bob, welcome back to the program, it's good to see you again. Robert Frye: Grant, thank you very much for the invitation and good to catch up with you. GR: Yeah, great. Well, let me just start with a very basic question about the film and then we'll get into some more details. But the film is, as I mentioned, in the introduction, it's the third part of a trilogy, the entire project being called the Nuclear World Project. I want to start, even though I interviewed you before about the first film, listeners won't remember that. So let me start with the first two films and then we'll get into the current one. But tell me a little bit about how you got the idea to start this project and what the first two films are about in my lifetime. And then the second one being the, \"Nuclear Requiem\". Tell me about those two and the project itself. RF: Well, I came up with the idea as a result of my life experience beginning with the fact that I was in the Army in Germany in 19, I'm going to date myself 1959 and 60 in Germany, Stuttgart. I went over as a chaplain's assistant, I was an enlisted man. But unbeknownst to me, although I had applied for another job, I had a highly secretive clearance. And after the first year, I ended up being assigned as a clerk typist to the unit dealing with nuclear weapons. It was a unit of five people, including myself. That really began my journey, if you will, in telling the story and appreciating the reality of nuclear weapons. Although I hasten to add, there are no secrets that are going to be spoken today or I ever have talked about because I realize the value of secrecy and how I, as an individual, am not going to reform the world in that respect. But that led to my going into network television. I ended up doing as an executive producer of World News Tonight at ABC a ten part series called \"U.S. / USSR: A Balance of Power\". That was on ABC in the mid 80's. Again, another touchstone on the way to this project. And I have a file full of ideas and I one day in 2006 pulling out of the file an image of the explosion of Hiroshima and it said, \"Do something about nuclear weapons\". Ironically, as a result of that, I met two authors in 2007 and also had a conversation with the first funder of this project. 2008 I started filming in Norway at a conference in Oslo, and then we went to Reykjavik. We being Richard Rhodes, the writer and myself, we filmed there, came back to the United States. Dick wrote me after that. he said, look, I've got too many projects, I'm not going to be able to continue this journey. And so I decided to go ahead and continue with some of the contacts he gave me and then as I picked up along the way. So I filmed through the year of 2008, going from Europe through the United States to Japan. And we filmed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki that year. It led to a whole bunch of other things, but it took me another three years to finish the film. First of all, there was the financial crisis in 2009, I think it was. Anyway, the point of it is in my lifetime is really the story of how this all unfolded. And I don't know if you've had a chance to see the Oppenheimer film yet, but I would recommend it to anyone listening, including yourself. It's a very interesting story, well told. But as a result of that, the film was distributed in my lifetime, was distributed, and then I went and took a rest from it. And a couple of years later I was talking with Alain Kremski, the composer of, \"The Nuclear Requiem\", which was sort of what I would call a mid-stream film, talking about the dynamic between the United States and Russia. At that time in 2015, I filmed 2015 to 2017. I had to update it because the story was changing as a result of the election of Mr. Trump. The Iran deal, if you will. North Korea was starting to make a lot of noise, if you will. And so that led to the Requiem, which was distributed in 2018. So here we are in the year 2023 and of course COVID came along and as a result of that I was sort of held back. But I said I'm going to do another film which turns out to be the one we're talking about today. The story of searching for resolution. Is it possible, is a question that I ask in this film. And I was able to connect with young people as well because I think it's very important to say, this story is not going away and there are individuals in the United Nations and other places where young people, who I encourage to get involved in the story, in whatever way they can. And so that's really what this story is about, searching for a resolution, is it possible? GR: You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher, and I'm speaking with Bob Frye, whose new documentary film, \"In Search of Resolution\" begins to air on PBS stations in August. So about the new film, \"In Search of Resolution\", Bob, you just mentioned young people, and I did want to ask you about that because it does seem to be an important feature of this. And you note that one of your aims in this entire project is to remind younger generations of the dangers of nuclear proliferation, since in part, they don't have the direct generational experience of the Cold War that you and I have. You know, the experience of doing the drills and so on. And so I'm curious to hear a little bit more of your reflections about that. I mean, tell me more about your encounters with younger citizens regarding this nuclear threat. RF: You just did a very good summary, Grant, of the idea, because my feeling is, look, I'm at a certain age where I want to hand the story off in whatever way is possible. And I will say the website will have more information on it. It's www.thenuclearworld.org. There's also a lot of material on there already. But between the three films and the web site, my idea is to pass it on to the next generations because you and I, as you referred to a moment ago, have experienced this. And for me from the get go, I mean, I was alive when the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I was young at the time, of course, very young. But I still remember the moments and went through the late 40's and the 50's. And I remember reading a book called, \"On the Beach\". GR: Oh, yes. RF: Which struck me. And then only a few years later, I was, as I told you, the story of being in a double door safe room dealing with nuclear weapon planning. But, you know, the thing is, this story doesn't go away, it's gotten more complicated. And although the number of weapons has been reduced to, say, around 13,000 from the high point in the mid 80's of 70,000 weapons and the nine nuclear states, the burden of them were primarily the United States and Russia, at the time the Soviet Union. But you know how that's changed is although the number of weapons that have been cut dramatically, the kinds of weapons that have been developed, and unfortunately this continues to become more, shall we say, progressive in terms of how the weapons are created and built, they're much more powerful. And I remember, I think I wrote this in their director's notes that I shared with you, a British officer saying, and this was, he said this in 1983, I think it was, that if all the weapons were thrown away, except for those on board submarines in both the United States and Russia, they both have enough of these weapons to fire one every 30 seconds for 24 hours. I mean we wouldn't get past the first 15 minutes when the world would be totally changed. And so I think the reason I tell this story is at least to make people aware of it. What they do with the information is their choice, not mine. And we live in obviously a highly politicized environment now. GR: Yes. RF: But and my, my job, I feel as a documentary producer and a former network news producer, this is not an advocacy film to advocate a particular point of view. It is the film to tell the story so everyone can receive it in their own way and whatever their viewpoints are. But that's another discussion. But so I really feel it's important for the younger generations to clue into this and get a sense of what it is. Although I remember having a screening a few years ago, the second film, and after my little presentation was over, a young man said, well, that's all very good, but why do we care? Because it's not a problem. Of course, that's not the issue of course, it is a problem. And the United States and Russia still are on a high alert system. I mean, there are so many different complicating factors in terms of sort of brushing it aside and saying, well, this doesn't matter any longer. And of course, this is illustrated in the beginning of this film by the idea that in January of 2022, the five nuclear powers who are members of the Security Council at the U.N. said there shall be no war between the nuclear weapons states. Of course, there are four other weapon states as well, and the five being the United States, Russia, France, the UK. And one more I'll get to it in a moment. But four and then the other four... GR: ...China, right? It's China, wasn't it? RF: Thank you very much. It was the last of the five, actually. So you have that plus the four that possess nuclear weapons, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea. And there are stories that weave through the film that tell the different dynamics. They're all individual stories, but they're also all linked by the idea that they all possess nuclear weapons. GR: You're listening to The Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher and I'm talking with Bob Frye, a documentary filmmaker and news producer who has a new film coming out on nuclear arms titled, \"In Search of Resolution\", and it airs on PBS channels beginning in August. About this new film, Bob, I wanted to ask you, is there is there one story or one person from your experience making this documentary film that has stuck with you the most since? RF: Well, there actually are several individuals that were involved in the creation of these films. But I'm going to take an easy answer on this. I just saw the new film, \"Oppenheimer\". GR: Right. RF: Which is getting a lot of play around the country, indeed around the world. And of course, as the scientific director of Los Alamos, he, in very large part, was the man that drove the creation of the bomb, if you will, with the explosion, the Trinity site in New Mexico and then it goes on from there. There are many other people that were around him, in fact, some who were against the idea of dropping bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. So if you if you have the time, go see the film, \"Oppenheimer\". Although there are many points in it that one can discuss or debate, it still is the underlying factor of how this happened. And there are many people who were involved in that decision to drop the two bombs, one on Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the test explosion at the Trinity site. But his influence obviously drove a lot of it. And, of course, as he got older, he went through a lot of serious, serious changes about the idea and the complexities. And that's one of the things that I find interesting about this story. There are many complexities to it and how to understand how the bomb itself, by the way, is an inanimate object. Individuals, human beings make the decisions whether they will ever be used. And of course, with all of the underlying treaties that have been created over the course of the last 77 years now, going (on) 78, there have been many attempts to try and forestall any other use of the bombs. And of course, what happened, and this is illustrated at the beginning of this film, after the announcement by the five that thou shall not use any of the bombs and there will not be a nuclear war, five, six weeks later, Mr. Putin declared war on and invaded Ukraine. And of course, the idea of that, you could go into many different declarations about how that changed the underlying thought of the statement made in January. But it brought back, I think, into the public view, the reality of nuclear weapons and the threat of them being used as Mr. Putin did. So here we are, we're in another cycle. And I suppose one refers to the Cuban Missile Crisis as another example of how this unfolded. But we're still in that cycle because of the war in Ukraine. GR: Yeah, I wanted to ask you a question related to that, which is, it kind of goes back to in my lifetime. But, you know, you've seen the whole arc of this and you mentioned the renewed concerns about this, given some of the things that Vladimir Putin has said. Do you think overall the danger from nuclear weapons is higher today or has it lessened in recent years? Does that young person that you quoted earlier saying this isn't a problem, is there some, you know, legitimate point buried in there? What's your sense of the danger level? RF: As another individual in the previous film that I talked about, the, \"Nuclear Requiem\" said, the fact that we have them, you can never discount the danger of their being used, is the real answer. But this conversation is not to have everybody go dig hole in the backyard and go into a bunker because we just don't know, Grant. We have, I mean, I'll ask you the same question, what's your feeling about it, given your distinguished background and how you look at this? Because I think everyone has a point of view about the possibilities. And the reason I do these projects and have, thank God, been able, been fortunate enough to get the third film done, is to present the story in a way that people can contemplate the underlying realities. And as I said before, for younger people, they should at least be aware of this as an ongoing threat. Because combined with climate change, nuclear weapons and name whatever else you want to name, the challenge to democracy around the world, this is another one of those stories that should at least have an awareness level for the younger people because they're the folks that are going to pick it up and carry it forward. And one can hope that they will come up with ideas, as I said, in search of what is the resolution. So far, we've not been able to find it. GR: Well, I wanted to ask you another question exactly about that. And you've sort of spoken to it already, but, you know, it's certainly possible to dream of a nuclear arms free world in the abstract. It's very hard for me to imagine how it will come about, absent, God forbid, some terrible disaster and perhaps not even then. So I wanted to get your sense of how do you see the long term future of nuclear arms? Do you think we're just going to kind of muddle along with this? RF: Good (question), complicated answer. The change from the second film, \"The Nuclear Requiem\", at the end of, \"The Nuclear Requiem\" production phase, there was the beginnings of what turned out to be the TPNW, the treaty to prevent nuclear weapons. So that story is presented in this film. So that's the change that's taken place since 2015, 2017. So, there is another effort, if you will, to change the underlying dynamic to bring the nuclear weapon states into a dialog. That's really the challenge here. And that point is made in the film, as anyone watching the film will see, by individuals that tell that story. You know, who is going to change that dynamic? Where is the shift going to take place? At least there is, quote,\" a vehicle\", \"a treaty\" where the attempt is being made to change the underlying dynamic. But against that is the fact that there are nine nations that have these things, have the weapons, and they're invested not only in terms of preserving them, but also in making sure that others don't get them. I mean, the story of Iran is interesting. Iran still, and apparently new dialogs are taking place to make sure that Iran will not go ahead and produce their own nuclear weapons, although they now have the knowledge and the material. Will other countries come into that play? There's another challenge there as well. GR: If you've just joined us, you're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. And my guest is film producer and director Bob Frye. I got to ask you a little bit of a curveball question now. And you mentioned Iran, it's related to that. But I'm wondering, do you think there's any relationship between civilian nuclear power and nuclear weapons? Is it possible to have a nuclear arms free world while we still have nuclear power? Nuclear power is back on the agenda in the United States. And certainly it's heavily used in Europe. Any thoughts on that? RF: Yes. You want to do another program? GR: (laughter) Yeah, it's complicated, again, yes. RF: Because there are no snappy one answer to this. The challenge is if you go back into the history of this story, which is told actually in the first film. Nuclear Power in the beginning was created to produce plutonium and uranium for the bombs. There was no such grand plan to have nuclear power plants for any other purpose. In the early 50's, Dwight Eisenhower declared whatever for peace, you know, it was a matter of they had to come up with a reason why they were building these nuclear power plants. The one in the South and the Hanford plant in Washington, the state of Washington. Because they were still producing massive amounts of our material to build bombs. As they continued to build more bombs they had to have the material. So in a way, the dichotomy that was taking place between the power plants and the production of the materials for the bombs were running parallel tracks. But there had to be a reason why how to develop nuclear power. And in my second film, I think there are 141 countries that have nuclear power. Most of them, of course, are not using it for anything other than electricity. So there is this kind of dichotomy that's taking place as a result of that. I mean, the argument about having nuclear power as part of the electric grid, of course, is a good argument. But it's also, well, what happens - because we still have this nuclear challenge when it comes to the production of the materials for... and that's where it all takes place around the fact they continue to look at all nuclear power plants around the world to make sure they're not producing the materials that would go into bombs. That's strictly for nuclear power electricity. GR: That's the issue with Iran, yeah. We've only got about two minutes or so left but I wanted to squeeze in one last question on a different topic, actually. I was very intrigued by something I read in your bio that you have a long standing interest, and obviously it's reflected in your film here that we're talking about, \"In Search of Resolution\". But you have a long standing interest in the media's role in conflict resolution. And it seems to me these days that the media is on balance, more a force for division and resolution right now in our society. And do you see that, do you see what I'm seeing? And if so, what do you think went wrong and in two minutes or less. (laughter) RF: That's the third hour we're going to have a conversation about. Because, look, I've been around this business for long enough to have experienced the shifts that have taken place. I mean, when I started off at NBC, as a researcher, Frank McGee in 19, I can't remember the decade now, 1962, 1963, we believed in serious journalism. My job was to fact check everything that we put on the air. I mean, I spent a six month project, who would be the successor to Nikita Khrushchev? I got to a point, ironically, about four or five years before that I'd been in the Army, but I got to a point where I was pretty knowledgeable about the topic. I went to the State Department in Washington, and I ended up in a double door think tank room with the two top criminologists that the United States had. Kermit (last name unintelligible) and Paul Cook. And so I had this book that I put aside after getting all this information. And my choices based on the research was that he would be succeeded by Kosygin and Brezhnev. That didn't come, just pull it out of my hat. So I think that the fact is and then when I was an executive producer and a producer of broadcast research was a very important component. And I'm now going to say it's been a pleasure having this conversation with you, and I look forward to an ongoing dialog not only with you, but the audience, because they should pay attention. GR: And I want to remind our listeners of this before I close out that your film again, the new one is titled, \"In Search of Resolution\". And our listeners can find out more about that film and other works related to this by going to www the nuclear world dot com, right? RF: Dot org. GR: ...Dot org, okay, www.thenuclearworld.org RF: And also because of the good works by you and others, the word is getting out and American Public Television actually is the distribution of it, takes care of the distribution of the film. GR: Great. Okay, thank you for that piece of information. That was Bob Frye. And Bob, thanks so much for taking the time to speak with me as obviously an important topic. RF: Thank you for taking the time to have me on your show. GR: You bet. You've been listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media, conversations in the public interest. Claudia Tenney( house.gov) Program Transcript: Grant Reeher: Welcome to the Campbell Conversations. I'm Grant Reeher. My guest today is Congresswoman Claudia Tenney. The Republican represents New York's 24th congressional district, which stretches along Lake Ontario from near Buffalo in the west to Watertown in the east, but does not include the city of Rochester. This is her third term in Congress. Previously she represented the 22nd District, which is more of the east of the current 24th, but ran and won reelection in its new district last November. Congresswoman Tenney has previously appeared on the program as a congressional candidate. Congresswoman Tenney, welcome back to the program, it's good to have you back on. Claudia Tenney: Well, thank you for having me Grant, it's a pleasure to be on. GR: Well, we appreciate it. So I just have a basic question for you at the outset about how this district you're representing now, the 24th, compares with the previous district you represented. Are there any significant differences you've noticed in terms of the culture of the district or the politics of the district that have struck you? CT: Well, I think probably the biggest difference is the size of the district and the fact that it pretty much circles Lake Ontario, other than a little bit of Monroe County and the Orleans County shoreline. It picks up all the Finger Lakes so there's a lot of water and it is the largest agricultural district in the northeast and the largest dairy district in the northeast. And we also have Wayne County, which is the third largest apple producing county in the nation, only second to two counties in Washington state. So agriculture is huge. We obviously have the Finger Lakes. We have a lot of crops grown, it's really pretty incredible from that viewpoint. It's very similar to NY 22 in that it's a very much agricultural, very much farming, was kind of, you know, old, industrialized, sort of rust belt like feel to it. We circle Rochester, we don't have the city of Rochester and Monroe County, but it's very similar in that it's just a very upstate feel. A lot of rural counties, there's twelve counties versus eight, and it's a little bit more Republican. If you want to look at the , you know, the political breakdown. But in my first election, I think I did really well in it and you know, it was a lot more challenging to do, you know, a real grassroots style campaign that I always do. So I think I've put 50 to 70,000 miles on my car in just the first year just with a lot of driving. So I try to get to every corner of it. But what is really nice and kind of interesting about it is when I first got out of law school, my then husband, now my ex-husband at the time, we moved to Canandaigua, New York, and that's where we planned on starting our life until some things happened with my family and our family business. And so my marriage license is actually in Canandaigua City Hall. So I have a lot of experience back here. My husband works at a company there, and I got started in my beginning of my legal practice there and ended up back in my original hometown of Utica. So I do have a lot of familiarity. I grew up showing horses, and I was a competitive curler, believe it or not. And so I spent a lot of time in western New York. I judge for show, 4-H particularly across that western New York, and had a lot of friends across the region. My dad was a Supreme Court justice, so when we were kids, we traveled all over and we actually used to go to the St. Lawrence and right up in my current district on the St Lawrence Seaway area and Watertown area a lot. So I have a lot of familiarity, but It's a really interesting district from the economic standpoint. Agricultural but small businesses, you know, all along the Erie Canal, a lot of great historical aspects to it. Harriet Tubman's Home is in Auburn, we have, you know, the Women's Rights Museum in Seneca Falls, which is part of this. All those really interesting parts of this district which make it very similar to the rest of New York, which is so historic and amazing and rich in history. So I love the district, it's really tremendous. And I live on Oneida Lake now, so I left Canandaigua and found a place, a permanent home in Oneida Lake. So I'm really excited about that. It's kind of neat to wake up and see the lake and to know that I represent so much beautiful lakeside and lake view properties along this entire district. So it's rich in so many things, great water. We have rich soils, so that's why it's so strong in agriculture. But it's a tremendous honor to represent the district and I've been very well received in this district. So I think that it's been a tremendous opportunity and I really, I just hope that I can, you know, continue to work on finding resources as this region in upstate New York seems to be losing a lot of population. So we're trying to bring resources back. We're hoping this soon, this Micron plant, which is not in my district, but I kind of circle it will bring new opportunities to upstate New York and actually bring our supply chains back, which is a big part of what I stood for and what I stand for as a small business owner. So bringing back supply chains, you know, invigorating our local economies is really important to keeping our kids and our grandchildren here in upstate New York. GR: I wanted to come back actually, and ask you about the Micron a little bit later, so I'm glad you brought it up. I did want to give you an opportunity right at the outset of our conversation to respond to something that previous a guest on the program a few weeks ago brought up and invoked your name in particular on. And this person was Nick Tomboulides, he is the head of the advocacy group US Term Limits, had him on the program. He was arguing in favor of term limits and in favor of a particular proposal that Congress has been considering. And he called you out, as I mentioned, for not backing this particular term limits measure that the group is pushing in Congress. You're a very vocal supporter of term limits. My understanding is you've been that way for a very long time, but you didn't like this particular proposal. So just explain your reasoning here. CT: Well, that's actually not the case, let me give you the whole breadcrumb. GR: Oh, okay, all right, fantastic. CT: So, I'm 62 years old now. So I was a, I got out of law school, I became an associate and a partner in my law firm within about four and a half years in Utica, New York. I had a wide ranging practice as a bank attorney, a tax lawyer. I even did personal injury. I did a lot of different commercial law, corporate law, and I had some specialties, I actually am an expert on federal Indian law, I represented the real Oneida Indians in there in a case in upstate New York which I represented for many years, well before I was in Congress. And still am friendly with the family and still trying to provide advocacy but I can't do it in any official way on the federal side. And then I actually ran our family business, which was a newspaper. So I was in the news business, I did that for seven years. We sold that to Gannett in 2004. I worked back in my firm and also as a private practice and also in our family business, which we kept one division of it, which has been around since 1946. So I didn't even get into politics until I was 50 years old. And I had, you know, the reason I ran was because I could see career, and career politician syndrome and people staying in office forever. You know, I believe in the Jeffersonian ideal of serving and going back to your farmer business. And so I've been a first, a big supporter of term limits. I put in a term limits bill in New York, I even put in a bill that said elected officials who were appointed or elected in the state had to be on a 401K and not on a pension because they were voting on benefits to themselves and that they would have a real stake in the success of New York if, you know, they didn't have a guaranteed pension that the taxpayers had to take all the risk on. So that was another angle on term limits. And then the peculiar thing about this strange term limits group in Washington and what you'll find in Washington, there are a lot of dark money groups, groups that can hide behind different vehicles in the IRS where you don't have to see where they're raising money and reporting. And unfortunately, this term limits group is one of them. I signed on to the term limits legislation, I'm a co-sponsor. I also signed their pledge back in 20 - I think it was 2018, 2020. And then, you know, they were running simultaneous ads against me and running ads at the same time saying, congratulate Claudia Tenney for supporting our pledge and supporting our term limits bill. So you can see that this is a duplicitous organization right from the start that doesn't know, the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing and running these simultaneous articles. But what it comes down to is, I am a compromiser in the end, you know, I'm a conservative by my beliefs and I believe in a self-governing, constitutional republic. And we need to, you know, make sure that we do that. You know, freedom and rights are what is enshrined in our Constitution. And sometimes we don't get everything we want on either side, the left or the right. And so I looked into this issue and I found that a lot of people really like to see parity. They like to see that if we can compromise and get twelve term or twelve years of Senate service and twelve years of House service, because the House is so important, you know, all appropriations and spending originate in the House of Representatives so we want people that know what they're doing there. And so then I thought, well, okay, I can accept that, you know, we can do a variation or an amendment to the term limits bill and maybe give members of the House up to six terms and up to, you know, two terms in the Senate, which would give us a parity with the Senate and not make us a less equal branch of the legislative. And so the term limits people determine this to be a violation of my pledge that we shall not serve over six years in Congress. And yet if a bill comes to the floor, they have threatened members of Congress. If a bill comes to the floor where maybe the House agrees to a constitutional amendment for four terms or even five terms or even six terms, which is a lot less than some politicians serving thirty and forty years, that they will come after and spend money against people for violating the pledge. So my view of this is you really don't care about term limits. You want this particular bill the way you want it and not a compromise, which is what Washington is really about. We're supposed to be compromising, you know, interesting, I'm a member, last night I had we had one of our organizational meetings for the Reagan O'Neill Club. It's a group of like-minded Republicans and like-minded Democrats, true conservatives, true progressive, I would say more liberals and how we can come together as a social group. There's no fundraising, there's nothing but making us get together in the tradition of the great relationship that Ronald Reagan, our president had with Tip O'Neill, the then speaker, and how can we work together as a group. And sometimes we can do a lot more that way. So the term limits group, I will say, has made millions of dollars over the years promoting this term limits concept. And if you look back at their ads over the years, they're very cookie cutter. It's basically the same ad they just plug in, you know, the name of the politician. They run the same ad over and over and it looks a lot like what they call grifting. They make money on it, they use it to, you know, basically bully members of Congress to do what they want and they're not interested in compromise. And, you know, if my Democratic colleagues say we'll vote for a bill that allows for six terms in the House of Representatives, and that's a reasonable amount, when you're a member of Congress it takes a little time to get under your feet and figure out what's going on. That's actually a good bill. And so the term limits group is out attacking members who are actually on their pledge like I am and members who actually sign their legislation of which there are about 100 of us, but there's 435 members of Congress. They're not going after the other 335 members or the under other seventy or eighty senators who aren't on the bill. They're going after people who sincerely and actually care about term limits and want to come up with a compromise. So it's really hard, this is what's hard for the public is to find out what's real and what's not. But unfortunately, in this age of the internet and the age of where you can just, you know, say something outlandish and you can reach people in their homes via internet or on texting, you can raise a lot of money and this group raises a lot of money and they really don't use it towards what I consider to be good things to do. I think there's a lot they could do with their money, like promoting good government, maybe helping the Reagan O'Neill Club grow and get more work between Republicans and Democrats and actually get compromise. But I'll tell you what the funny thing about their bill is this, that this bill doesn't apply to Nancy Pelosi or any other, Mitch McConnell or any of these long term serving politicians, because it's the bill has an element of, you know, rules for thee, but not for me. So if you if I vote for this bill, it doesn't apply to me, it only applies to people in the future. So I think that's a little disingenuous. I mean, I don't want to sign on to something, and I did it not knowing that that was part of the bill. And I looked into it and I said, how about we change that and make it reasonable? Let's have six terms in the House, two terms in the Senate. Let's have it apply. Let's have that be a constitutional amendment and we can really get back to the Jeffersonian ideal. So sometimes, the reason, Grant, I explain every vote that I take on the House floor and I'm the only member to do it apparently, in detail, is so I can decode Washington and help everyone understand what's going on regardless of party and help people understand that, yeah, you know, we need to understand if we're going to be self-governing as Lincoln envisioned, we need to understand what's going on in Congress and how to vote and how to decode the bills. And that's what I do. And so, you know, I get criticism from the left, I get criticism the right. But I've had almost $50 million spent against me by both sides, trying to take me out because I'm just trying to tell the truth. I'm trying to be, you know, get back to self-governance. And I'm trying to find common ground where we can find common ground that preserves our Constitution. And believe it or not, there are a lot of Democrats who do believe in preserving our Constitution, and we may disagree on how to get there, but we can find ways to do that without having this outside kind of I call it grifting, which is unfortunately a real big part of what goes on in Washington. And the average person is too busy working and doing their job or, you know, if they're retired, they're enjoying their retirement and their grandchildren. So I try to do that in a simpler way as possible and give people an opportunity to really understand what's happening in Washington. GR: Well, I'm glad I asked you that. And the distinctions you're making, I think, are reasonable and important. And it's interesting to hear about this Reagan O'Neill Club as well. You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher, and I'm talking with Claudia Tenney. The congresswoman represents New York's 24th district. I wanted to ask you how you think the speaker of the House has been doing and leading the institution. How do you think Speaker McCarthy's been doing so far? CT: I think he's doing a pretty good job. And I think, what it was, a lot of people were critical of the initial speaker race where we were voting on the speaker. But I think in a lot of ways I try to see if I can see the glass is half full on that. I thought it was great that people were tuning in, paying attention. It was kind of interesting that the cameras are everywhere and you got to see everyone around the chamber. My Buffalo Bills bag got to be prominently placed and part of Twitter, Bills fans for a long time. And so it was it was a good process and I think that, you know, I was concerned and Republicans tend not to stick together, and I was concerned that we weren't going to get very far and we've had some fits and starts. But I think a lot of the agenda that we tried to get through has happened. I think there's been so much transparency and openness with the rules. The Democrats actually can put any bill on the floor that they want, they can open bills in committee. And I think those are things that were taken away under Nancy Pelosi's leadership and Kevin McCarthy brought those back. So I think that on balance, I think he's doing a very good job in terms of, you know, getting the Republican agenda forward, which is what he's supposed to do. But in terms of the openness with the Democrats, I think that that is something that I think a lot of them appreciate. You know, on committees on their ability to be able to put bills on the floor. You know, when I was in the minority, I couldn't put bills on the floor. But when I was in the majority my first term, anybody could put a bill on the floor. And Nancy Pelosi reversed that and Kevin McCarthy brought back the openness and the transparency on the floor and the ability of individual members to represent their districts, which I think is really important if you're talking about a representative government. So, I think Kevin has got some struggles, you know, obviously, we have a lot of factions in the Republican side, but I think he's doing a good job. And I think it's you know, it's actually brought people together, which is part of the reason we were able to have a successful Reagan O'Neill Club. GR: And what do you think are the most important votes that you have taken so far in this term that you're serving in? CT: Well, I think some of our main objectives, obviously, H.R. 1, which deals with energy is a really important issue. And let's go back to the Micron plant, that is going to require baseload energy and a lot of important features that water, energy and things that they need to make that a successful transfer of our supply chains from China to us and critical chip manufacturing and chip fabs and all of the nuclear power plants left in the state of New York, which provide baseload power actually in my district in New York 24, either in Oswego County or Wayne County. And so we don't have really too many other options other than to continue to look at a lot of people in New York, almost everyone is dependent on either having propane gas, natural gas, oil or woodchips to heat their homes. And New York State is on a fast track to try to eliminate the use of fossil fuels, even clean burning fossil fuels and fuels like natural gas that have brought down emissions versus the use of coal. So I think that that H.R. 1 and allowing, and even though we got it passed and we didn't get it through the house, we actually were able to get some permitting reform in the in the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which was highly criticized by some. But in the end, I think it turned out to be a good vote for me, I voted yes for it. I think it was important that we didn't undermine the full faith and credit of the United States by not allowing a debt ceiling to collapse, but also by getting concessions out of the administration and out of the Senate to agree to some things like permitting reform so that we can get back to getting people back to work, so we can have more energy and abundant energy. You know, even our own energy department, the Department of Energy in Washington has stated that we need 40% more energy in the next ten years than we need now. And they're talking about using fossil fuels. So I would much rather see us take advantage of less emissions, things like natural gas instead of coal. So there's a lot of things that we can do on the energy front, which I think is really important. So I think that was one of the, H.R. 1 is our important legislation and important bill, we did get some concessions for it. Some other things that we got in that bill was also something that would actually institute work requirements for some welfare programs, including TANF and others. I'm in a meeting on TANF, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families right now and Ways and Means, and our biggest complaint from every employer across all sectors across this entire state is that they can't get people to work. And we need to start giving incentives for people that are capable without children that are dependent or able to work that don't have, you know, special needs or different issues where they can't work, to get back to work, because we do have a problem with getting productivity and growth and that's what we're going to need to get out of this fiscal crisis. So that was another aspect of that bill that was important. And I think a lot of people think that it was actually an appropriations bill. We didn't spend anything and we didn't cut anything. What we did is come up with a framework. So now as we go through the National Defense Authorization Act amendments and bill this week, when we conclude that we're going to be getting it through the appropriations process, and that's where the metal is going to, you know, hit the road because that's really the Super Bowl. And that's going to be really important going forward, is how we do appropriations and what we do in order to make sure we have growth, that we are able to cut some of our unnecessary spending, we're going to go double down on going after some of this fraud, abuse and waste and also claw back some of the code funding that was unspent so that we can lower the national debt and bring us back into some fiscal sanity so that we don't have this inflationary problem that we're seeing. Though it's not rising as much as it was before, it's still high. GR: If you've just joined us, you're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. And my guest is upstate New York Congresswoman Claudia Tenney. I wanted to ask you a question about something that you've been issuing, your office has been issuing a lot of press releases on. That's the plea bargain of Hunter Biden regarding criminal tax charges and a gun related felony charge. Just briefly, what's your concern regarding how this case was handled? CT: Well, first of all, this is a unfortunate, that it took Chairman Jason Smith, who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee now to actually open up a whistleblower portal where whistleblowers who challenge our government and some of the things they see can come forward without being retaliated against and charged with anything. And so these whistleblowers came forward and they presented this evidence. And it's interesting, they weren't looking for anything on Hunter Biden, they were actually investigating an international porn ring and what ended up happening is it led them to Hunter Biden. And they found these unusual payment, when you add them together with the suspicious activity reports that came up from the Treasury side, they added up. And there were there were millions and millions of dollars coming from Romania, Ukraine and China through Hunter Biden and his entities to various members of the Biden family, including potentially Joe Biden. So the Department of Justice, as revealed by the whistleblower, Whistleblower One, was actually slow walking the ability of this evidence to be investigated. In fact, one of the DOJ officials tipped off the Biden administration transition team to prevent them from getting to a storage container that had documents that it would have led to more evidence on what's happening with Hunter Biden. And this plea deal was rushed. And we're hoping, as a member of the subcommittee on Oversight for Ways and Means, that we can actually get some kind of either, you know, some kind of I'm not sure what word I'm looking for, but to make sure that we can get public and make part of the record, I guess, is what I went for, it's already public, the whistleblower testimony. We want to make it part of the record and we want this judge before considering this plea deal on July 26 to actually be able to see that there is a lot going on. There are foreign, there's other people being charged with violating the FARA Act and Hunter Biden is clearly involved as a foreign agent. He has not signed up as a foreign agent, so he needs to do that, and that's a felony. You know, there are other, they slow walked some of these cases so that each year when we got into '14 and '15, the statute of limitations was actually told and there was evidence that that was intentional. Based on testimony and notes, contemporaneous notes from the whistleblowers and other people like Attorney General Weiss down in Delaware, and that he has given conflicting statements. So it's opened up a Pandora's box and kind of goes, you know, dovetails with a lot of what's being discovered on the Oversight Committee with Jamie Comer and so we're looking into this. That's our job as oversight is to look into what's going on in the administration. And a lot of this is very irregular, it looks like Joe Biden was using his son to funnel money to his family and to himself and this is inappropriate. It's very corrupt and so we're going to get to the bottom of it. And we think that this is a rush to a plea bargain and we're going to try to make sure the judge has all the information that this shouldn't be the end of the road for Hunter Biden. GR: We've only got just a few minutes left, but I want to squeeze in this other topic and I'm sure you can talk about it for quite a long time because your background as an attorney. But I did want to ask you about the Supreme Court because it's been issuing a lot of decisions and obviously they've been making a large impact on the country. And, you know, we could just tick them all off, but they've been issuing a lot of decisions of great import to the policies and the life of the country. Are there any particular decisions that the Supreme Court has made that have especially pleased you or concerned you? And again, we only have a couple of minutes left. CT: Yeah. Look, I think the Supreme Court is doing a stellar job of upholding the Constitution, moving away from a lot of political decisions, although a few of the decisions, you might argue, were somewhat political. But I think, you know, the Supreme Court is basically just saying, you know, for example, you know, I know this is a controversial one, but the Dobbs decision was the abortion decision. It didn't ban abortion, it just said it's up to the states. And so this has been misinterpreted and extrapolated improperly by, you know, pro-abortion advocates. And to be honest, with you, as a New Yorker and I'm pro-life, we have late term abortion in New York based on the New York law. I debated that bill when I was a member of the state legislature and, you know, this is a bill where if you're pro-life now your advocacy begins. If you want to protect life, you need to be an advocate at the state level. And so you know, we didn't win when it comes to that if you're pro-life, but it depends on the state. And I think we should have had this conversation fifty years ago instead of holding off and we would probably be in a different place in Roe versus Wade, we wouldn't have had we wouldn't have had to go through a Dobbs decision. So I think we're going through that process and I think there's a lot of unnecessary angst on the decision. And I think it's great that we're going to discuss it, we're going to talk about it and find some common ground on it and what's the most humane and best way to deal with that. But that's just one decision. A lot of the decisions have just kind of realigned us back to constitutional thinking. So I think the Supreme Court, on balance, has done a pretty good job. You know, I think we're going to be looking to the court to, you know, to not necessarily please conservatives or liberals, but they're going to be holding up the Constitution. I think that's exactly what they're supposed to do. As the daughter of a Supreme Court justice from New York, that's the role of the judge. They're supposed to interpret the laws, not make political decisions. So I feel like the courts at least are moving in that direction mostly. GR: Well, we'll have to leave it there. I wish we had more time. And I see the curling stone behind you. So I'm already thinking that when we have the Olympics, next time, we're going to have you on to talk about curling in addition to what's going on in Congress. But that was Congresswoman Claudia Tenney and Congresswoman Tenney, again, I just want to thank you so much for taking the time to speak with me. CT: Thank you so much. And by the way, the very first curling fundraiser had in Washington I did this year. It was called, \"The Miracurl on the Frozen Swamp\". GR: (laughter) You've been listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media, conversations in the public interest. David Schleicher( law.yale.edu) On this week's episode of the Campbell Conversations, Grant Reeher speaks with David Schleicher. He's a professor at Yale Law School and an expert on state and local governments and their financing, land use and urban development. He's the author of, \"In a Bad State: Responding to State and Local Budget Crises\". Program transcript: Grant Reeher: Welcome to the Campbell Conversations led Grant Reeher. My guest today is David Schleicher. He's a professor at Yale Law School and an expert on state and local governments and their financing, land use and urban development. He's also the author of a new book titled, \"In a Bad State: Responding to State and Local Budget Crises\". Professor Schleicher, welcome to the program. David Schleicher: Thanks so much for having me, I'm excited. GR: Well, it's good to have you. So, let me just start with a really basic kind of historical perspective question, because you do talk in your book about different moments in time for state and local governments and their financing. So, can you just provide a very brief thumbnail history of state and local finances and recent decades? DS: In recent decades, so I'm going to go back a little bit. Basically, American history throughout, from the first Congress to today has had lots and lots of situations in which state and local governments have gotten over their skis. And so it was something that first Congress dealt with, it was something the last Congress dealt with. And the basic problem is we have lots of states and state finance is what people call pro-cyclical because they can't print money and because they, after the 1840's and then after the 1870's, both those periods are kind of (unintelligible) have balanced budget rules. They, when they get more money they spend more money, when they have less money, they spend less money. And this kind of structurally leads to crisis. And so we have over the course of American history at different moments, from the Hamilton's assumption of state debts through the New York City fiscal crisis in the 1970's, through COVID, a series of moments when state and local governments get into fiscal crisis. GR: Okay, and so this is something that has been consistent over the years. But is there, do you think there's something fundamentally different, structurally, about the challenges that state and local governments are facing now financially, or is this just a new version of the same story? DS: It's mostly a new version of this. I mean, there are some kind of notable differences. I mean, it's always different, right? So history rhymes, but it doesn't repeat. And so the period after the Great Recession was a big period of state and local government pull back. One of the reasons the Great Recession was so long was that state and local governments had faced this huge financing crisis and then cut everything in order to make their, kind of to be able to survive. And some places didn't of course. You have Detroit and Puerto Rico, which had to default. One of the things they did in order to do that was that they didn't save for their pensions. So one of the things you can do in order to avoid a fiscal crisis is borrow. And not saving it for your pensions is a form of borrowing. One of the things we saw in the post 2008 period, which should have been, in theory, a great period for infrastructure development because interest rates were low and unemployment was high. And you should be able to hire a bunch of guys to build bridges or whatever. And we saw instead, because governments were in a period of fiscal pullback, what they did was they borrowed by not saving for their pensions. And that's debt too, for all intents and purposes, but it's not attached to a road or a bridge or anything. And so if you think, look at what are the great infrastructural marvels of the 2010's, they don't exist for the most part, and that's because of this dynamic. And so coming into the COVID period, things have started to get better that we'd had a number of years of economic expansion with that, a number of periods of steep fiscal expansion and then the period of COVID, like, everyone got really nervous about fiscal crisis, the federal government dumps, I think what can only be described as a boatload of money on states and cities. And right now states and cities are in a lot of ways in the last budget cycle, the best period they've been in in a very, very long time. But it's starting to change that. You're starting to see in New York revenues are coming in way lower than anticipated. You're starting to see structural deficits going into where at this moment of inflection, where things have been great for a while. If you just came politically of age, it's neither of us, but, you know, just came politically of age recently, state government is something that, things are always getting better. They're cutting taxes, they're spending more money, they're doing more stuff. Last, say, half decade to a decade. But that's about to change. We're about to enter in a renewed period of fiscal retrenchment in which there's going to be cuts. There's still the huge legacy pension debt problem that arose from the post 2008 period. And we're going to see a period of some substantial pain and maybe some crises alongside it. GR: Yeah, I want to come back to the New York case a little bit later, but you've kind of already spoken to this but I did want to put this question to you anyway, kind of as a follow up to that. There seems to me there has been and I'm thinking of recent decades and you've just told the story of this, this pattern where we read and we hear at various moments that states are in a crisis on their budgets. I thought of the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008. You mentioned that with the Great Recession, I thought of COVID. And then either one of two things seems to happen. The economy rebounds or, and maybe both, the federal government provides a large influx of cash. You described it as a boatload for COVID, and then the crisis seems to subside, people stop talking about it. So is this just kind of the pattern, do you think, that's going to keep going in one way or another? DS: So it could be on two things. One is that when the federal government does provide money, it creates incentives for the next crisis. That if the federal government provides money, we call this the problem of moral hazard. Some of your listeners may recall that a lot of discussion of moral hazard about banks in the post 2008 period. But the same type of idea which is that if either governments, or really because their lenders believe the federal government is going to come in with a lot of money, then there's a little less pressure to engage in fiscal rectitude going forward. And so we may be pushing this cycle down the road and creating more and more crises going forward. The other thing is that no, I mean, most state and local governments aren't in crisis most of the time. It is not the case that we are always in crisis. The one thing that made the post 2008 period really notable is something that the late, great Dick Ravitch used to say is that we're eating our seed corn. And he was lieutenant governor of New York at the time during this period, and he noted that the budgets were doing a lot of things that were keeping the state solvent. And this is not just true about New York, but were using one time revenues or were taking advantage of the large infrastructure that was developed over a long period of time and not maintaining it. We're not adding to it. And so while we've managed to mostly avoid new crises, we've done so at some really substantial cost because the budget didn't get structurally balanced. GR: Right. You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher, and I'm speaking with David Schleicher. He's a professor at Yale Law School and the author of a new book titled, \"In a Bad State: Responding to State and Local Budget Crises\". So you've already talked about this, but one obvious solution when these problems come up is for the federal government to take on an even larger role financially and policy wise, arguably at the expense of the states. Because as you mentioned, the federal government comes in and makes an injection of cash, but also attaches certain strings to that, provide certain incentives in doing that. One of the things that occurs to me as a sort of a political or a cultural problem for that is that we know from surveys over recent decades that, well, actually it goes back 40, 50 years that state and local governments are the governments that citizens trust more than the national government. And they like these governments. And again that trend goes back to the 1980's. So is that pattern problematic as a solution? That the part of government that is least trusted comes in and then takes over more control in these moments? DS: So again, I mean I think there are real downsides to providing too much aid but I wouldn't put too much stock in those surveys that say that people like state and local government the best. One thing we've seen in recent years is that voters know increasingly a little about state and local government. That, in fact if you look at voting patterns, the correlation between people's state legislative voting patterns and their vote for president is now upwards of 95%. It's extremely, extremely tight. And no one thinks that people are, that their beliefs about the New York State Assembly are influencing whether they like Joe Biden or Donald Trump. It's all going the other way. And so it's increasingly not clear that anything that happens in the state legislatures matters to how people vote for state legislature. And so people like state government on some theoretical level and local government, even particularly. State government, there's actually a little bit of mixed evidence, but they don't behave like they like it very frequently. And so the centralization that federal aid is generally associated with is a, one thing is kind of a product of these policy choices, but it's also a product of where people's attention is. And so one of the things I've written, and you can see this in kind of in the late parts of the book, is that people who care about federalism should care about state and local governments, should focus a little less on kind of federal state relations in the way that they traditionally have and a little more on making state democracy work better. Because if the reason you care about federalism is you want different people to choose different things so that the people of Syracuse and people of New York City or the people of New York State and the people of Texas can choose different things representing that they're different people. But increasingly, our federalism looks like a red choice and a blue choice. And that isn't like super, super, super attractive. GR: So there are two things going on there, I think, and one we've talked about a lot on this program in recent years is political polarization, which is driving that linking of the national and the local voting patterns and again, people's understanding of it. But the other thing, and I wondered if you have looked at this, is the connection between the collapse of media coverage of state and local politics and people's knowledge about state and local politics. DS: So Daniel Hopkins, wrote a wonderful book called, \"The Increasingly United States\" which tracks this phenomenon, puts a lot of the story on decline in state and local media. And there's a lot of evidence for this. So, when a local paper closes, split ticket voting declines really dramatically. And relatedly, by the way, this is something interesting, which is that borrowing costs go up. If a local newspaper goes up, the government in which that (newspaper) cover(s) will suddenly face, it'll cost more for them to borrow money. And the reason is lenders aren't dumb and they say, well, no one's watching the store anymore. And so for what it's worth it feels like a little bit outside the scope of the book, but I think there's a pretty strong case for subsidies for state and local media, and that it would be cost effective for government to do so because it would reduce their borrowing costs. And so governments generally don't like the press that's covering them, but like it's good for them in the end. GR: That's interesting because I've had a couple of guests in the past that have made the argument for some kind of public financing of state and local media coverage but they've never framed it that way, that it's in the government's own interest to do that, that's fascinating. You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher, and I'm talking with David Schleicher, the Yale Law School professor is an expert on state and local governments and their financing, land use and urban development. And he's got a new book out titled, \"In a Bad State: Responding to state and Local Budget Crises\". So one obvious question I want to put to you is, are there any states or localities that have, in recent years, been in your view, models of financial responsibility? DS: So it's an interesting one. So for the last, say, 40 years before the last five years, five to ten years, Connecticut was one of our great fiscal basket cases. They created a pension system and just didn't save any money for it for a really long time. And the belief was, I think something along the lines of the Mad Men era will never end. Companies will always leave New York and move to Connecticut. Fairfield County will keep shooting off money. And as a result, the state doesn't need to worry about things. And so then it went through a period where this started to the - it passes an income tax in the early 1990's and generally enters in a period of retrenchment but not successful. It is along with New Jersey and Illinois and Kentucky are the most indebted states. But in the period they starting in 2017 they make a couple of major policy changes that have led to some real fiscal policy successes. And so, one is that they did something really interesting which is they inserted into their bonds, their promises to lenders, a series of fiscal promises, things that they would do. And all states have fiscal rules but they're generally difficult to enforce but the promises are now enforceable by investors. And one of these things is something called the volatility cap, and that sounds super technical, but the basic idea is that Connecticut, like New York and like California and a number of other states is heavily reliant on very volatile revenue sources. Basically rich people's capital gains and income taxes. And what the volatility cap said was that if revenues come in above expectations, the money is automatically saved. It can't be spent by the legislature, it goes first into the rainy day fund and then into the pension funds. And the combination of this enforcement mechanism and this policy and then a will of the governor and legislature, neither cutting taxes too much, they cut taxes a little bit or raising spending that much had made Connecticut turn from being a New Jersey style basket case into the success story of the COVID era. So in COVID, during COVID, every seat got like, the economy was doing well, much better than people expected, particularly capital gains were doing really well. So you had this volatile revenue doing really well, stock market did really well. And then the federal government provided a lot of money in order, it provided money to everywhere such that it wouldn't create too much more hazard in the places that really needed it, like the MTA or wherever. And the result of this was that Connecticut had this big volatile revenue source and they actually did very well do some technical things involving inflation as well. And as a result, but they could have just spent all the money, but they didn't. And that is a I think is maybe the great success. Again, it's not a state that has always been prudent. So like, Utah is one of these states that's like, got good credit is the federal government. It's like just, you know, Virginia also, but Connecticut is a real success story in that you saw real change. I think real credit goes to the right politicians from both parties in that state for not pushing the envelope when they could. GR: So Utah, Virginia, historically good financial states, Connecticut, is shifting story. Right now, who are the worst offenders at this moment? DS: The book is about what are the legal tools that are available if a crisis happens. I want to state, I'm not a credit analyst, I'm not heading new investment by which municipal bonds you shouldn't buy or anything. That's not what I'm doing. Yeah. I mean. GR: We'll put that disclaimer out there (laughter). DS: (laughter) I mean, you have a couple of ones which are like Illinois is doing a little better than it was, but it's still, you know, in has very substantial fiscal problems, New York and California are the other ones that you put in there. But the basic story is that it's a little hard to know right now because, again, everyone's budget was in great shape this year, almost everyone's budget was in great shape this year. The question that is out there and it is as much a question of politics as it is a question of just sharp numbers, is what policies did you take during the boom? They're going to be really hard to reverse in the bust, right? And some of those are promises. So, for instance, New York City has signed a lot of contracts with public workers that have had implications in out years. But other things are just policy choices that are harder to reverse. So, for instance, New Jersey, I'm keeping it Northeast for obvious reasons, New Jersey just passed a special tax cut for older property owners. And this is the kind of thing that people grow to expect and it's going to have fiscal implications. And so this year it's fine, next year, the year after, when these people have gotten to expect it is going to be really hard to take that back. On the other hand, not taking it back. It's going to mean having to cut other places really severely. GR: Well, you mentioned New York kind of in the problematic category a couple of times. Of course, I wanted to ask a couple of questions about that. So, this first one gets to when you mentioned you know, Connecticut could have spent all the money and they didn't I immediately thought of New York. And so perhaps on that note, let me ask you this. You know, New York, it was facing a significant budget deficit during COVID and then got, as all the states did, big injection of federal money to help out with that. But then the state turned around and raised state spending even further in the next budget. And it's been setting records in real terms for state spending every year and did so again this year. So at the same time that's going on, the population of the state relative to other states is going down. In the last two censuses, New York has lost three congressional seats total. So, people look at this, and I guess I'm one of them, and not necessarily from a political party perspective, but this just doesn't seem sustainable. I mean, is this is this sustainable? DS: It's a good question. I mean, there are a bunch of things going on in that question, I want to separate them a little bit. GR: Okay. DS: So one is the population trends in New York. And I really think that you can't talk about the population trends in New York as one story. You're really (talking about) two different stories, there's a downstate story in upstate story. And the downstate story is not really a tax story, exactly. Property prices, real estate prices for housing are still extraordinarily high in Westchester and Long Island and in New York City. And the reason for the prices are so high is that they don't allow any housing to get built. I mean, any. Nassau County is the slowest growing rich county in America. People sometimes think about San Francisco as the place where housing doesn't get built, but nothing can beat Nassau County. Nassau County is the single slowest growing rich county in America...close to it, it's in the competition. And Westchester is a little better, but not much better and New York City is not that much better either. (In) the whole area, New Jersey has some growth. And so the reason population is falling there is not because of long run fiscal trends or long run economic trends, though certainly work from home is taking a hit for New York City itself, but rather on their regulatory decisions, because otherwise the case the prices would fall, whether they would substantially, but like, if you buy a house in Great Neck, have fun, you know? The upstate story is a story of economic decline. I mean, long run economic decline that is itself probably aided by the cost, the excessive cost of government. And so that is a different type of story. On the other hand, there's population decline in places that are quite like the rest of New York State. So in Ohio, in Michigan, you know, and so it's, the other thing I'd say about New York State and its fiscal situation is like, will it be able to continue under these circumstances? And that's like the I'd say it's the million dollar question, but it's billion dollar question or multibillion dollar question. New York State is really notable in not only that it has fiscal problems that other states do, but the cost of government in New York State is extraordinarily high. And so one kind of very easy version of this to see is the MTA, which runs transit, that if you look around the world and try to find the most expensive tunneled subway projects in the history of the world, do you know what number one, number two and number three are? East Side Access, which is the LIRR to Grand Central. They are the seven train extension to the West Side and they're the Second Avenue subway. And this is true about the MTA, but also broadly true about New York state government, which is that New York State government is remarkable for what citizens get, it's a remarkably expensive proposition. And I think the hope of New Yorkers, and by the way, I'm a New Yorker too, so just so we're clear, like I'm paying these taxes. I work in Connecticut, but I live in New York City. The hope is that fiscal pressure will encourage government to make it more effective. That is to say, when we have less, we're going to figure this out. The worry is that we won't and we'll just get less and less. GR: So I'm going to change the subject a little bit, let me take a break here just to remind our listeners who we're talking to. If you've just joined us, you're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. And my guest is Yale Law School professor David Schleicher, and we're talking about his new book, \"In a Bad State: Responding to State and Local Budget Crises\". I do know from many conversations with individual state legislators, maybe more outside of New York State than New York State, but nonetheless, a lot of these legislators really do worry about what the other states around them are doing regarding regulation and taxes and welfare and health care policies, on the one hand, and then losing or attracting businesses and wealthy residents on the other. You've kind of spoken to that in talking about New York. And, you know, political scientists call this interstate competition, the competition among states thinking about this. How does that affect things that, the kind of things that you look at, do you think? DS: Yeah, so it's interesting. I mean, so it's a little less in this book, but it's something I've worked on, which is that we've a real question about why people move between jurisdictions. And one story which we associate with the economist Charles Thibeault, is like people are moving to get public policies, right? So you're moving to get taxes one way or another. You get lower taxes, better schools. And this is certainly true. And so on the other hand, a lot of people, movement decisions are driven by other things. New York City has had high taxes for a really long time, and they've had particularly high taxes on rich people. And I don't think the rich people stay in New York City because they love the taxes and the garbage on the street. But I do think there's going to be new pressure on government created by work from home. They say people are going to be more mobile than they've been. At least some subclass of workers are more mobile than they've been. And that's going to increase interstate and local competition. GR: Interesting. So we've just got a couple of minutes left. And I want to squeeze this last question in, it's about Syracuse more specifically. And I know that you're not an expert on Syracuse, but you do study urban development and land use. And in Syracuse, we are currently facing two very large issues regarding this in the coming years. One concerns the redevelopment of a chunk of land under and around an elevated highway that is now coming down. And the other is the construction that's going to happen in the next few years of this huge chip manufacturing complex from Micron that's going to bring a lot of high paying jobs to the area and really change the local economy. So, I know you're not an expert on those particular things, but my question is, are there any general do's and don'ts on these kinds of big urban development, economic development questions that you would throw out there that people here in Syracuse might want to bear in mind? DS: Yeah. Two things I'd say. The first is that if you're going to get a big shot like a giant chip manufacturer, one of the keys is accommodating it. And so you need to allow housing to be built nearby and Syracuse has plenty of housing in a lot of ways. And so but you need to invest in the variety of things that go along with it. And there's always an instinct to see how you can tax it as much as you can. There's this new thing how can we take it? How can we squeeze this lemon as much as we can? But one of the things that makes jurisdiction like, that's an attractive thing to do, right? So we want to get revenue. But it's on the other hand, it's a like you can kill the golden goose. The second thing is that the cost of providing new infrastructure, in this case knocking down new infrastructure is extremely variable around the country. And people often say, well, as long as you get the project done, it's going to be fine, and you see that often. But the, one of the things to remember is that every dollar you don't spend on one project is a dollar that's available for something else. And that is just like hawk eyeing the cost of these things would be a good idea. But I mean, broadly, speaking, it's like it's great to get a giant dollop of federal money for your city, everyone loves that. And it's great to have a new big plant come in. And so, you know, it's, hopefully everything works out for Syracuse. GR: Well, that's what we're hoping, too. We'll have to leave it there. That was David Schleicher and again, his new book, and it's very fascinating a really interesting historical perspective in a lot of different ways of looking at this issue is called, \"In a Bad State: Responding to State and Local Budget Crises\". David, thanks so much for taking the time to talk with me. DS: Thank you so much for having me. GR: You've been listening to the Campbell conversations on WRVO Public Media, conversations and the public interest. Sean O'Keefe Program transcript: Grant Reeher: Welcome to the Campbell Conversations. I'm Grant Reeher. My guest today is Sean O'Keefe. He's had a rich leadership career in government, education and the private sector, among other positions. He's a former secretary of the Navy, Comptroller of the Defense Department, head of NASA, deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, former chancellor of Louisiana State University and former chairman of Airbus and vice president of General Electric. His government leadership positions were during the two Bush administrations. Professor O'Keefe currently holds the Phanstiel Chair in Leadership at the Maxwell School of Citizenship at Syracuse University. And he's with me here today to discuss the current Republican presidential field and to look ahead at some possible outcomes. Sean, welcome back to the program, and thanks for making the time to talk with me. Sean O'Keefe: Well, thank you. It's always a pleasure to be with you, and I look forward to the discussion but I do want to specify one major caveat, which is no one ever retained me or hired me to do any campaigning for any Republican candidate or Democrat for that matter. And so I am not a campaign expert by any means. And certainly an analysis of the current field of Republican candidates that have announced, I don't know any of them well. And so as a consequence, my observations are strictly based on my background and experience, as you mentioned, as an appointee in two of the two Bush administrations and therefore seeing an awful lot of this up close and personal. And I've worked on Capitol Hill for a number of years prior to joining the administration. So, it's grounded in that kind of background, which never had any association directly with campaigns going forward. So take all that with a large grain of salt. GR: Well, that's okay, because that kind of perspective is exactly what I'm looking for. So we have no problems with that. But let's just start with a basic question about the size of the field. As we're talking today, we're talking on Thursday, a new candidate has just come in making the number of announced candidates for the Republican nomination 13 at this point, by my count. There are a few more possibly on the way. (The) Mayor of Miami being the most recent one making it 13, and we have had, if we look to recent election cycles for the presidential election, we have had a lot of candidates in recent years for the side that is not holding the office. But does 13 at this point still seem like a lot to you? SO: It does. I mean, at the same time I think your observation is absolutely right on mark. We've seen in the modern era of electioneering and campaigns is that the party that is not the occupant of the White House at that point typically has a pretty rich extensive field and this dates back two decades. Even the 2000 election started with a much longer list of folks that quickly winnowed down to George W Bush. But nonetheless there's been a draw of a larger field of candidates in the early going. And the conventional wisdom or at least that period of time has been that if you're not into your candidacy and announced by somewhere between January and July of the year prior, so eighteen months out at the minimum, that typically is a disqualifier for candidacy. Although there are exceptions that can be found for that. But by and large this kind of size of a field eighteen months in advance is not way out of the mark of what we've seen in the last couple of decades on either side, Democrat or Republican, to see the range of candidates for those who are not currently occupants of the White House. GR: And so that number, let's just take this cycle right now, the 13 that are announced right now. Do you think that number reflects anything? Does it reflect, for example, on the Republican side, a perception of vulnerability regarding President Biden's reelection? More people want to get in because they see this as a winnable race in the general election? SO: There's an element of that. At the same time, I think the stronger element has become that many aspirants to the White House or for any other visibility, if you will, has been to file for candidacy to become a candidate for president of the United States to get greater exposure. And so you've seen so many different candidates that no one would have given a prayer of being the nominee, who nonetheless, on both sides, have figured out ways to launch a campaign for some finite span of time to at least raise their visibility within the general public, as well as polling and all the experience that goes along with trying to manage a campaign of any size. And so this is I think a combination of all those factors. And I think that second feature of this visibility is almost a more overriding issue, rather than really looking at President Biden's vulnerability any more than what you'd think in most of the elections we've seen in the last 20 years in which the opportunity is viewed as, well, you know, there is chance here of lightning may strike and if it's there, I want to make sure I'm part of it. So there's an element of that going on as well. GR: Yeah, I'm thinking of Pete Buttigieg, for example. You know, what would we even have heard of Pete Buttigieg had he not run for president and look where he is now. SO: Good example, yeah. GR: So you may have already answered this, but I was wondering whether the large field also might indicate that there's a perception among these Republicans that former President Trump's ability to secure the nomination has some vulnerability to it, even though the media and many others are treating him as the clear frontrunner. And if you look at the polls, certainly there is evidence of that. But I wonder whether the large field reflects the fact that they think they can take down the former president. SO: No doubt about it. I think there's a mindset that there is a vulnerability there. But then again, I don't know that it's any more pronounced than what you've seen with any other front runner over the last, you know, we've got a couple of decades of looking at how the modern political cycle has worked here. But nonetheless, this is one that's pretty specific in that case. And there are an awful lot of folks who are in the race at this juncture who view former President Trump as being, you know, either over the hill and not... we've had enough. And so it's yeah, while I don't disagree with the policies someone may say, they nonetheless will say you know, it's time for him to move on and another standard bearer to pick up the flag and carry it. Then there are others who are just viscerally opposed and seek to do anything they can in order to assure he is not the nominee. And then there's another group that feel like, you know, if you don't try, you don't buy a lottery ticket, you never win, you know? So lightning may strike and this may be the opportunity that where his dominance as a nominee may crater. I think the overriding issue that seems to be conventional wisdom that every, you know, standard kind of, you know, political commentary seems to offer, is that while he may have the front runner status as a Republican nominee, he nonetheless has a very difficult time securing anything approaching a majority to win the general election. And so several candidates are animated by that point to suggest that independent of what they think their chances are, that this may be an open field because nominee or, you know, likely or not, he just is not the guy that's going to be able to carry this over the goal line. GR: Yeah I want to come back to a couple of those points here in a second. You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher and I'm speaking with Sean O'Keefe, who holds the Phanstiel Chair in Leadership at the Maxwell School of Citizenship at Syracuse University. On one of those points you raised, there does seem to be a consensus among the pundits that the large number of candidates helps former President Trump. It will work to his benefit, and that seems to be what the former president thinks as well. He, every time a new candidate comes in he seems more confident. Do you think that that's correct, that the larger number of candidates helps him? SO: To an extent. I think they're, some of the pundits I, you know, have seen the opinions of or heard the opinions of, they've laid out the logic that, yes, that larger group looks an awful lot like the same dynamics that made his candidacy in 2016 possible. GR: Right. SO: So here we are with a repeat. I think that's a misinterpretation and I think this some of this is driven by a much different approach where in 2016, I think most of the serious first rung contenders believed they all had a shot and really found that the arguments between and among them were more dominant in the primaries than it was against, you know, Donald Trump's candidacy in 2016. At this stage it is more about former President Trump and I think there's a view there that really overrides an awful lot of this. That is, more likely that you'll see fewer internecine debates if you will between everyone else but Donald Trump, you know, in terms of trying to differentiate themselves from him as opposed to others. They'll get to that later if they think they're rising in the polls. But at this stage in the game, they're all targeted on one condition, which is, is all the controversy today going to be sufficient to unseat him from that lead dog position? GR: Yeah. And so who would you regard among these 13 announced candidates, and again from admittedly from the distance that you said you're viewing them from at the beginning, but, who would you regard as the top contenders at this point? Just sort of guessing how their candidacies are likely to go? I think it's too early to be trying to think too much about poll numbers because people haven't gotten even to hear them on a stage yet. But, who would you put in your top tier, do you think, at this point? SO: Yeah, I mean, harking on your qualifier. Yes, I do feel like Bob Uecker in the seat in the very farthest top of the stadium observing what's going on the field, but it certainly appears as though the consensus of most of the folks who make a living opining on this are thinking that Governor DeSantis has got the best shot at potentially being a contender relative to Donald Trump. I think that's skewed a bit because when you look at others, each of them in their own right, have a potential to raise their visibility sufficient to become a differentiated candidate. And I think that there are some that are more likely in that case than others. Certainly Nikki Haley and Tom Scott, or Rick Scott, excuse me, Senator Scott from South Carolina. GR: Right, right. SO: Too many folks named Scott out there. But it certainly is a case where you're seeing several of the current sitting legislators or former governors like Chris Christie and others don't really need to worry about driving a whole lot of additional name recognition. They're there in some respects, but others are looking to amp that up and become a logical alternative given the unique campaign direction that they're taking. GR: You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher and I'm talking with Sean O'Keefe. He holds the Phanstiel Chair in Leadership at the Maxwell School of Citizenship of Syracuse University, and his past positions include several presidential appointments during the George H.W. and George W. Bush administrations. Sean, this next question is something that I do think your past experience probably gives you some insight on, because you've been on the inside of presidential administrations and dealt with a lot of people who would become contenders for the presidency. And I want to go back to 2016 and former President Trump when he was running then and the dynamic that we already talked about what the number of candidates in there. What struck me was, it wasn't so much the number of candidates that really helped him in '16 it was the time that they stayed in the race, and you never really had a clear alternative emerge, they had like three or four of them, and they kept splitting the vote. And I think that allowed former President Trump to rack up a number of first place or second place finishes even though, as you pointed out earlier, you know, they weren't majorities. And given the rules of Republican primaries, that was enough to get him over the top and build up a big lead. I'm just wondering, and this is what I want to ask you about, this time around, since as you've already know that these candidates share an intense desire to not see Donald Trump as the nominee, that there will be some coordination among them, among the campaigns, that they'll be having conversations with each other about, okay, we don't want to repeat that as a group. And so, you know, we need to be talking to each other about when we're going to get out or what sort of the reasonable standards are for staying in. And I've read a couple of things from Republican operatives to that effect. Do you think those conversations are happening among these campaigns? SO: It could be. I think the two factors that are going to play into this more than anything else is what we've seen in typical primary contests. If they really don't see a pathway to win and they really are serious about running for president, that's when they'll pull out. I mean, Jeb Bush was a clear example of that. I mean, he really thought he had a chance at it. But in the first few primaries, all the indicators demonstrated that that was not deep enough. A set of support that would be necessary to make that happen. And rather than prolong it, he was gone after the South Carolina primary. So, you know, and he had to be by far and away the most qualified and the most seasoned of campaigners in the collective in that year. So, you know, the strongest contender against Donald Trump was the fellow who just wasn't catching fire and he read that tea leaf exactly right. That was just the time to depart. Several others, you know, they're going to continue to look at whatever the numbers are and if their intent is, again, to get into this for the purpose of raising visibility, well, they'll stay until they think that they've exhausted that opportunity and that path has run out. Or if they're driven by the proposition, I'm going to stay in until the last second to make absolutely certain Donald Trump doesn't have an easy run at this, you're going to get a few of those. Certainly, Chris Christie has said that as clearly as anybody could as a candidate. Now, you know, whether or not his intent would be really to run for president for the purpose of serving, that's a whole other dialog by itself. But certainly in this campaign phase, that's what's animating candidates like Chris Christie right now. But, you know, there's a set of factors in that. And the likelihood, certainly in 2016 there was a fair amount of discussion, debate from what I understand that went on about how to really motivate different candidates to make a decision to depart earlier rather than later, so as not to make this pathway that clear for what was perceived as an outside chance that Donald Trump would emerge as the winner. Well, they didn't and he did. Whereas this time around, there is no way the party is going to engage with any of these candidates to encourage that. They are a wholly owned subsidiary of the Donald Trump campaign. So as a consequence, they're not likely to have any weight whatsoever in motivating that dialog. It's going to be more of a set of bilateral agreements, if you will, between and among different candidates and discussions that may go on. But it isn't going to be anywhere near as concerted as what everyone really hoped for within the party structure back in 2016, to see some viable critical mass developing and it just never did. GR: Interesting. So I wanted to ask you about two people whose names have not come up yet. Different kinds of questions for each one but I'll lump them together. First one is former Vice President Pence. You didn't mention him among your top tier and I thought, you know, he seemed like he has a potentially very powerful narrative, which is on the one hand, I'm a conservative, I've got complete credentials as a conservative and I'm more consistently a conservative than former President Trump was. And secondly, he could say, look, you know, also I saved democracy. I mean, I'm sure he won't say it exactly that way, but that will be part of the message that, you know, I did something that required a lot of courage at the risk of my life, literally, and for the benefit of the country. And so that is a strong contrast, I think. So I'm wondering if you don't see a path or some traction for him, and the other person is someone who didn't really get into the race, Liz Cheney. I mean, she was in, but not in. And a lot of people were looking at her thinking this is the person that can really take former President Trump on and provide an alternative voice for the Republican Party. So any thoughts about those two? SO: Well, I think your description of Vice President Pence is right on the mark. That is exactly the narrative that I believe that his advisers and he has embraced and feels that given a fighting chance, he'll be able to differentiate himself from Donald Trump on exactly the same themes you just articulated. His longer I mean, much longer record of dedication to those conservative principles. This was not something he ever adopted for convenience. This is something that's been a consistent part of his makeup and his dedication to the task I would argue, much as you have that or at least suggested in your narrative, that he did step up at a time that differentiated himself from an administration that really was, looking at situational ethics of the highest order. This was not something that Mike Pence ever embraced or advocated. He tolerated, which is maybe one of the greatest criticisms that I think will come back to haunt him, as well as the fact that he was as big a defender of the former president as he was during the bulk of the administration. So, all those factors play into this to make this a harder path for him to really develop. Plus, he has not yet been identified as a rational kind of alternative to Donald Trump. In part because, you know, whether we like it or not, and this may be the most important signal that we're reading in this early going into the campaign, is that the supporters of President Trump are enthusiastic. They are very dedicated. There's no question little can move them off their support for him. Doesn't matter how many indictments you throw at him or how many, you know, indiscretions that he's demonstrated to have committed that's been accused for years to see more evidence of, that's not going to move anybody off. And it's largely because he appeals to the notion that this always happens to those who are try to fight for the underdog. He has sold that narrative. And as a consequence, as an awful lot of folks that like his spunk for that reason alone and will stick with it independent of the facts. So, there are all kinds of dynamics engaged in this that make it much more unlikely that there would be a gravitation towards a rational conservative alternative with a demonstrated track record, but certainly nowhere near the, you know, the pizzazz that the Donald Trump brings to the occasion. Mike Pence is just not going to fit that bill in that sense. So I just you know, again, he has a commendable record in many respects as a governor, as a congressman and as vice president and certainly withstood that test that you outlined with extraordinary distinction. That said, I think all that counts for little with those who were the absolutely committed to Donald Trump going forward. Liz Cheney is a different story. I think she never articulated an aspiration for running for president. That was never part of her plan. She's never uttered that. That said, what she was dedicated to doing was making absolutely certain that he would not ever return to the White House. She did say that very clearly all the way through on every single element of what she was engaged in and laid out the facts as part of the January six commission that demonstrated all of her reasons why that was the case. So given that circumstance, she sees sufficient number of candidates in the race right now who are picking up that mantle. And a lot of this, given the fact she's never had a deep passion for running for the office, I am not surprised to not see her announced in this race. GR: If you're just joining us, you're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. And my guest is Syracuse University professor Sean O'Keefe. And we just got a couple of minutes left, but I wanted to squeeze in two more questions, if I can. And the first one goes to this pizzazz of former President Trump you were talking about. One of the things I'm wondering about is when I have read some of the policy positions that he has put forward in this election cycle, that's getting less attention I think than his indictments and other things, some of those policy positions are pretty far out there this time around. I'm thinking of the proposal for ten new cities to be created on federal land along with some kind of public process for deciding where these cities are going to be and what they are. Another one is his call for the direct election of school principals. I can just throw that out there is how chaotic what that's going to do for school districts around the country. I'm just wondering, as those positions get more well-known, do you think that might eat into some of his support that he has to actually defend that stuff? SO: Let's hope (laughter) I mean, the more out there he is on this, the more he is convinced. And his campaign focus seems to be that that's how you gain the attention. Now, whether you follow through on it or not? I think his record is most charitably stated. It's mixed on that point. I mean, his consistency as a conservative or anything else that he would label himself as are absolutely not, you know, square with any of his historical record, that's for sure. GR: Well, let me squeeze this other question in, if I can. I'm sorry to interrupt you, but we just got a couple of seconds left. The other thing I wanted to get your quick thoughts on in literally just a few seconds, is it does seem to me that thinking about a general election and thinking about the vulnerability of President Biden, the stickiness of his low approval ratings, other problems, that it would be a great time for the Republicans to put forward a more moderate candidate for the general election, because you'd have a lot of people who you could peel off a lot of the Democrats and you could peel off a lot of the independents that are uncomfortable with a Biden second term. I mean, I didn't even mention his age on top of that. Kamala Harris as the vice presidential backup and she's very unpopular. So the problem, of course, is these primaries that we've been talking about, how do you get a moderate Republican through the primary? And in 15 seconds or less, do you see a path for a candidate like that? SO: No. The party would have to be committed to the proposition that it's time for a change, that there needs to be a new standard bearer, that given the record of losses of the Senate, of the House, of you know, every one of these during the course of his tenure that have just been failed conditions really needs a reversal. And that's not happening because, again, the Republican Party today, good, bad or indifferent, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Donald Trump. GR: OK, we'll have to leave it on that note. That was Sean O'Keefe. And Sean, thanks again so much for taking the time to talk with me. SO: Appreciate it very much, Grant. Great to be with you. GR: You've been listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media, conversations in the public interest. Nick Tomboulides( termlimits.com) Program transcript: Grant Reeher: Welcome to the Campbell Conversations. I'm Grant Reeher. My guest today is Nick Tomboulides. He's the executive director of U.S. Term Limits, a nonprofit organization dedicated to instituting term limits and legislatures at all levels of government, including Congress. Nick's been leading the organization since 2013. And prior to that, he has experience as a social media strategist and a campus organizer. Nick, welcome to the program. Nick Tomboulides: Grant, glad to be with you. Thanks for having me on. GR: It's great to have you. So let's just start with some basic background information on your organization. When was U.S. Term Limits founded? Who, by and large, funds it, et cetera? NT: So we were founded in 1992, which was really the start of the modern term limits movement. We've always been founded then and now, sorry, we've always been funded then and now by angels and activists. So we've got a few really big guys who write really big checks. And we also have like a small dollar donor network of people who believe in the issue, send in five or ten dollars here or there. And U.S. Term Limits really got on the map in the early 1990's when we participated in initiative campaigns in 23 states to put term limits on members of Congress. So we assisted in these ballot drives, it went on the ballot, I think it passed with an average vote of around 70%, polling has actually improved since then, but those laws were challenged. One of them, for example, was the law here in Florida, we have a measure in our state constitution which says that all members of the Florida congressional delegation shall have term limits. There were 22 other states that did the same thing by 1995. It was challenged in court, it was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and in the 1995 split decision U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that term limits for Congress may not be enacted by a state law. So no state statutes, no state constitutional amendments, it has to be an amendment to the US Constitution because that's how the qualifications for Congress members are spelled out. So, since that time what we've done has been a hodgepodge of, of course building support for an amendment to term limit Congress, but also participating in term limits campaigns all over the map ranging from local offices to state offices. Just last year we participated in a campaign to term limit the legislature of North Dakota. So that became the 16th state with legislative term limits. And we're pretty much active wherever you can find the term limits law. GR: Right. And you mentioned you have a couple of big donors. Just give me some examples of who those folks are. NT: Well, I do like to be respectful of donors' privacy, but one that's completely out there in the open is Howard Rich, who's the chairman of U.S. Term Limits, been involved in the effort since inception. And Howie is very well known, you can look him up on Wikipedia, he's a true believer. He's someone who's given a lot of his personal time and money to this effort because it's something that he genuinely believes in. GR: Okay, great. Well, I know that you could probably talk for the entire rest of the program about the question I'm about to ask you, but give me the brief version if possible. NT: Sure. GR: What's your organization's most important set of arguments in favor of term limits? NT: So I think there are so many compelling arguments for term limits, but I think at its core, term limits is an election reform. Term limits recognizes that there is a tremendous disparity in power and an advantage at the ballot box for incumbents. We see that 95% of incumbents are routinely reelected, whether it be Congress, your state legislature or your city council, that tends to be how it goes. And yet these politicians also have a very low approval rating. And so something is clearly wrong. And when you dig a little bit deeper, you see that special interests and PACs are cutting checks to incumbents at about a ten to one clip versus how much money they give to challengers. So, incumbents have so many advantages. They have the built in name recognition. Every initiative that they announces in the paper every other day, you know, they can spend basically taxpayer money to campaign for reelection. I just got a mail piece last week, it's a beautiful color four page mail piece for my congressman about all the amazing initiatives that he's working on. And then at the very bottom, it says, you know, this was funded by the by the U.S. Congress, by the taxpayers. So they have the franking privilege and of course, they have that insurmountable financial advantage that makes it incredibly difficult for outsiders to compete. I think it was the Center for Responsive Politics said that the cost of unseating a U.S. House incumbent was $2.5 million. You know, most ordinary Americans just don't have that sitting around, nor do they have access to these elite fundraising streams and in Washington, D.C., in the centers of power. So there's effectively a barrier to entry built around our government. You cannot dislodge these incumbents. It's like pulling a sword from a stone. And I think the way that you level the playing field is with term limits, because with the term limit, you are guaranteed an open seat election at a regular interval. You know the barriers will be brought down, it's far easier to win an open seat election than it is to dislodge an incumbent. But when you have open seats, you're going to see people from a more diverse array of backgrounds running for office. You're going to see people who probably have never contemplated becoming career politicians, because now that they know they can just serve for a short amount of time, make an impact, and then return home to live under the laws that they've made. They'd be more incentivized to run because under the current system, you run for office and you have to be a backbencher for 20 or 30 years buried in the seniority system under Nancy Pelosi or Mitch McConnell or whomever. So I think it would really open up the system to a whole host of new faces, new voices, new ideas. You know, Harry Truman once said that term limits are a remedy for old seniority and senility, two terrible legislative diseases. I think generally we agree with that. GR: You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher, and I'm speaking with the executive director of U.S. Term Limits, Nick Tomboulides. So there are some strong counterarguments against term limits and I wanted to get your reactions to a couple of them. First, they certainly haven't looked like a great success in California, at least when we looked at when they were first implemented and comparing the operations of the legislature after term limits to the way it worked before. And then more broadly, in that vein, there's a concern that any sort of term limit provision that has a real bite to it is going to largely remove the legislators who provide the institutional and policy memory that are needed to craft good legislation. They're the ones that get term-limited out. And their absence is largely filled by lobbyists and that's one of the things that happened in California. So that's the first sort of counter argument. The second one that I'm familiar with is that you mentioned that there is this - going to be this different type of person that wants to come in because they don't have to wait for 20 years being a backbencher. On the other hand, there is an argument that term limits may cause many newer legislators to become even more career conscious than they would have been before, and to think about their time in the legislature simply as a stepping stone to something else, because they know right off the bat they can't stay there very long. So in some ways there's an argument that it actually makes the problems of political ambition worse rather than better. How do you respond to those counter arguments against term limits? NT: Sure. Well, I guess we can start with the California example, you know, I'm troubled by much of the political science literature on term limits, because much of it tends to be surveys of the actual politicians and lobbyists and staffers who are affected by term limits in these states. And so I think there's a huge conflict of interest in soliciting their opinions because they don't want to lose power. I liken it to, you know, if we were going to do a study on whether prison bars were effective and we were only asking the inmates, right? They have a conflict of interest when it comes to term limits. In terms of the empirical data we see that states with term limits, on average, have a higher ranking of fiscal health. If you look at the Mercatus rankings, which I think were published for four straight years, then they stopped it, but there are other groups that do the same thing. Higher ranking of fiscal health, we see that term limits have made legislatures more diverse and more reflective of the people at large. There was a paper by Professor Samantha Pettey at Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts, which found that job term limits at the state legislative level led to a 33% increase in the emergence of female candidates for office. Because the reason women are underrepresented in politics is, it's not because the electorate is biased, it's because we don't have enough women who run. Because when women run, they win. And this paper showed that women actually, as opposed to men, have less of a desire to be career politicians. And in a term-limited system, you really level the playing field if you can increase those numbers, get some parity. I believe Nevada recently became the first state to have a majority female, it was either a majority female chamber or a majority female legislature, and that is, of course, a term limits state. So I think the data is very strong in that regard. In terms of institutional knowledge, what I'm seeing and I think what a lot of people who support term limits see, is that members, incumbents are not applying their institutional knowledge to the issues at hand, as opposed to actually reading the thousand page bills that are presented to them. They are spending more time raising money for their next reelection. They're spending more time dialing for dollars and there was one report that said the average incumbent spends four or five hours a day in a call center just begging donors for money for their next reelection campaign. I don't really think that's conducive to good public policy, nor do I think relying on lobbyists for so much information and instruction is conducive to good public policy. So I think experience is important, knowledge is important, but I would prefer real world experience. I would prefer a system in which physicians, more physicians feel empowered to run for office and tackle health care issues as opposed to career politicians. So I would prefer a system where more teachers feel empowered to run for office and tackle education issues as opposed to career politicians. So I don't discount the value of experience, I just think real world experience that term limits delivers is the most important kind. And may I address the point about lobbyists as well? GR: Absolutely. Yeah. Go ahead, quickly, yeah. NT: So, yes, one of the most common myths that circulates in any state capital or even Washington, D.C., is that lobbyists favor term limits because they are just waiting for this brain drain so that they can fill up all this, take advantage of all the novice new legislators and tell them what to do. What we find is that the opposite is actually true. That what happens is that as you spend more time in office, your ties to lobbyists deepen your reliance on your constituents' lessons and term limits may be the only way to, in fact, sever those ties. I study the campaign finance records of term limits campaigns that we run all over the country. And what I find is that lobbyists always contribute their dollars to whichever side is trying to prevent, weaken or abolish term limits altogether. If lobbyists stood to benefit from term limits, they'd be coming into my office and trying to help me, hasn't happened once. They're always on the opposite side of it, so I just don't think that holds water. There was a quote from Jack Abramoff, the infamous mega lobbyist who may be back in jail, I'm not sure what his legal status is now, but he said, a politician who stays in office for life is worth his weight in gold to lobbyists, because they don't lobbyists don't like to repurchase politicians over and over again, and they don't want to have to learn a new rolodex. They prefer to go back to their old standbys, their connections that they've made for decades and decades. And term limits really is a way of severing those ties. And I feel like it also jams the revolving door because people who leave the legislature to go try to lobby, if you're constantly bringing in a new crop of legislators, then they won't know the new people. So their experience, their relationships won't be as valuable. There was a paper from Duke University, it was Jordi Blanes Vidal, who found that when someone leaves a Washington office to become a lobbyist on K Street and then their former boss retires, such as a senator they worked under retires, their income as a lobbyist drops precipitously because they can't trade off that relationship anymore. So I think term limits would definitely help improve the situation with lobbyists. It would sever the ties they have with incumbents and it would put a jam in the revolving door. GR: It's interesting what you found when you followed the money. You're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. I'm Grant Reeher and I'm talking with Nick Tomboulides. He's the executive director of U.S. Term Limits, a national nonprofit organization dedicated to instituting term limits at all levels of government. So, let's just think about the dysfunctions in Congress for a second. And I think you were very effective in talking about some of the advantages that you saw and answering the criticisms that I put forward. But one of the big dysfunctions in Congress ,and just as an aside, maybe we can get to this later, it's not clear to me how term limits are going to make elections cheaper. So I don't know how you're going to necessarily cut into that 4 hours a day of calling time, at least for the three or four terms that a limited term member is going to pursue. But we can get into that later. But one of the big dysfunctions for Congress, though, obviously has to do with political polarization. The two parties pulling apart, not cooperating, not a lot of dialog between them, not a lot of problem solving and a lot of name calling. And it's hard for me to imagine exactly how turnover would help with that particular problem if it is a party based problem, because we also see polarization among the electorate. You know, voters are yelling at each other and calling each other names. It's not just members of Congress. And we could even also look at some data, which suggests that some of the polarization in Congress is even starker among the newly elected members because they come in all gung-ho and fired up to push that agenda that they're part of by being an active member of the party. So how do you see term limits helping polarization? How's it going to get at that problem? NT: So I think polarization has multiple causes, one of which of course is the mainstream media is constantly driving people into those hyper-partisan corners of ideology. And I think, to an extent, that's unavoidable. Because fear sells when it comes to mainstream media, fear of the other side, fear of compromise. So I think some of that is unavoidable. But in terms of term limits, what we're looking to do is dramatically transform the culture of Washington, D.C. We're looking to lower the stakes of holding elected office. And it's my opinion and the opinion of those who agree with us, that if you go into it knowing that this is a short term commitment, knowing that it is not possible for you to build an empire in this seat because you will be ejected in six years or maybe sooner, because an incumbent who has spent less time in Washington is easier to unseat. So you would also see more competitive elections against incumbents. But if you have that view of elected office, that you're viewing it more as public service rather than a career, I think you'd be more inclined to compromise and work with the other side on solutions that benefit everyone in our country. I think term limits is actually a fantastic example of this, Grant. We have 82% support for term limits among Republicans, Democrats, Independents, non-party affiliated. It's the ultimate bipartisan issue. It's the issue that could bring everyone together and yet the senior career leadership in Congress doesn't touch it with a ten foot pole because there is no partisan incentive to do so and because it cuts against their self-interest. Whereas when I look at the members of Congress who actually support this reform, who're willing to kind of work across the aisle and do this, it tends to be the newer and younger members. So, I think by transforming the culture of Washington, D.C., changing it from a permanent sinecure that people can hold on to for decades, changing it from that to a temporary assignment, a duty to do what's right for your country, I think we'd see less partisanship. GR: Now, you talked about, when you were talking about the origins of your organization going back to the early 90's, one of the things that was a big moment for term limits at the state level was that time period. And you saw during the early 90's about 20 states enacting term limits for their state legislatures. NT: Right. GR: Most of that happened through referendums and initiatives and a few instances the legislatures themselves suggested it, but probably because they could see it coming. So the enthusiasm for that at the state level seems to have cooled a lot since then. We haven't seen a whole lot and you mentioned Nevada being a recent win for you at the state level. Why do you think that kind of ran its course in the early 90's and then, except for these individual exceptions, you haven't seen a whole lot of action at the state level on this? NT: Very simple answer. It's because we ran out of states with an open and accessible initiative process where citizens could put it on the ballot themselves and it would stick permanently. You're in New York. I'm originally from Connecticut. If I'm not mistaken, these are states where in order to get anything done, you literally need the chickens to vote for Colonel Sanders. GR: (laughter) NT: You need, in Connecticut the legislature has to vote for something twice before it can get on the ballot. It's not like Florida or California, where you can circulate clipboards and petitions. And that is, I can't tell you how much of a critical difference that is because term limits cut so deeply against the self-interest of the elected officials. They're just never going to put it on the ballot themselves. I think there was one commentator at the Cato Institute who said it would be like getting demons to shut down the gates of hell. Like it's just, it's not practical for politicians to term limit themselves without immense external pressure, which is very, very difficult to create. So it wasn't so much that enthusiast as a waned as we no longer have a practical, effective process in most states to get it done. But that process does still exist in some areas like North Dakota, you saw, for example, still has an open initiative process, got it on the ballot last year, passed it. GR: Oh, that was the one I'm sorry, I switched out North Dakota with Nevada. Yeah. And that's a yeah, perfectly plausible, and you're absolutely right, an understatement to say it would be difficult to imagine this happening in New York. NT: There are also some states that only have a statutory initiative like Utah for example, that was one of the states where we term-limited the legislature. What happened the next day? The legislature turned around and repealed their own term limits because it was only a statute. So if you really want to do it right, you have to constitutionalize it. And there are very few venues where you can still do that. GR: If you've just joined us, you're listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media. And my guest is U.S. Term Limits Executive Director Nick Tomboulides. So let me ask you this question, you kind of already answered what you're up to now with the emphasis on trying to get a constitutional amendment to have this be successful for members of Congress, so we won't get into that. But I did want to ask, it does seem to be the case, as you point out a couple of times now, that term limits for Congress enjoys very broad support. Nonetheless, term limits as an issue to press seems to be more associated with conservatives than liberals. You can correct me if I'm wrong on that, but that's my impression. And I'm not trying to suggest that your organization is especially conservative, but I'm just saying that is what the association generally is. Why is that the case, do you think? NT: So it's not something that's really reflected at all in the polling. If you look at most polls, I think it's like 82% with Republicans and then Democrats are a couple of points behind. In some polls Democrats are ahead of Republicans. So we don't see that reflected really at all among the general public. But you're right that there is a difference in how elected officials tend to approach this issue. And I think it goes back to the Contract with America and Newt Gingrich. I think in the early 1990's, term limits became so closely associated with the Republican Party because it was in the Contract with America that left a very sour taste in many Democrat's mouths. And they still remember that, they still have the battle scars from back in those days. And so they're a little bit apprehensive about touching it, but it truly is a nonpartisan issue. There's something in it for everybody. Democrats favor campaign finance reform. Getting back to what you said earlier, making it easier and cheaper to win an election because the seat is open is effectively a form of campaign finance reform. And that's data, by the way, that we have from Center for Responsive Politics, shows that the average person who wins an open seat race spends way, way less than someone who has to defeat an incumbent. GR: Yeah, absolutely. And we've seen that up here in this area of New York for sure. So, we've only got a couple of minutes left, but I did want to fit this in. Your organization has been in the news up here lately for its pressuring of Claudia Tenney, who is a member of Congress from upstate New York. I think by all accounts, very conservative, obviously and obviously a Republican. She represents New York's 24th district. She was emphasizing term limits and now doesn't seem to like them so much anymore. So what's the problem with Claudia Tenney? Is it just she's turned against term limits? What's going on in a minute or less? NT: So in a minute or less, wow. Well, there were nine members of the New York congressional delegation who signed the U.S. term limits pledge for a specific constitutional amendment. They said, when I get to Congress, I'll support an amendment for three House terms, two Senate terms and no longer a limit. Only one of those nine is currently being attacked by anybody, and that's Claudia Tenney, because she's the only one of the nine who broke her word. She signed the pledge when she needed the votes, when she wanted to capitalize on it. And now that she's safely protected as a D.C. incumbent, she wants nothing to do with it anymore. And she's actually filed a term limits bill for double the number of terms. She's filed a bill that would let people spend 24 years in Washington D.C. and she has she's lashed out at our organization. She's lashed out at other PACs. But I think when you make a promise to the voters, you have an obligation. You have a duty to keep it. Honesty is the best policy. GR: And we have another member of Congress that is in a district that is centered around Syracuse, Brandon Williams he's (a) freshman this year. Replaced John Katko, both of them are Republicans. How does Brandon Williams rank with your group so far? NT: I believe he is a pledged signer, but I'm sorry I don't have that information off the top of my head. I believe he signed the pledge and co-sponsored House Joint Resolution 11. So I think he's doing the right thing by us. But Claudia Tenney, very different story. She made a commitment to the voters and she betrayed them and broke her word. GR: Well, we'll have to leave it there. That was Nick Tomboulides and again, his organization is U.S. Term Limits. It's easy to find on the web if you have an interest in getting more involved. Nick, I want to thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me. There's a really interesting set of conversations and argument back and forth. I really learned a lot in this. Thank you. NT: I really enjoyed it. Grant. It's always fun to discuss term limits with a political scientist because you guys have your finger on the pulse of this probably better than anybody. So I really enjoyed it and I would love to come back and do it again. GR: All right, great. You've been listening to the Campbell Conversations on WRVO Public Media, conversations in the public interest. "}
