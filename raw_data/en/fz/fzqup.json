Identify failure points and root causes 2. Redefine audiences to match the most at-risk populations 3. Utilise the Enduring Outbreak Communication Planning Process to develop a communication strategy or revise your current strategy to address the barriers and audiences identified in steps one and two. See page 3 for the COMMUNICATION PLANNING PROCESS.IN SUCCESSFUL AREAS: 1. Shift communication to promote the benefits of routine vaccination 2. Concentrate on eliminating campaign fatigue 3. Continue to test and refresh communication to optimise performanceThe first step of addressing an Enduring Outbreak is conducting a systematic analysis of the root causes of the failure to interrupt polio transmission. Social, epidemiological, and campaign data and information should be aggregated and organised for analysis. 2 ENDURING OUTBREAKIdentify barriers for the remaining at-risk and problem populations. Explore each issue using the ROOT CAUSE WORKSHEET (page 7) to identify the underlying dynamicsCOMMUNICATION PLANNING PROCESS The Communication Planning Process outlines the steps and key decisions to make when developing a communication plan. Each step has a corresponding component in this guide for reference. For Enduring Outbreaks, the process begins with a deep analysis of the key issues affecting campaign performance in the preceding six plus months. Document the decisions you make and the information you use at each step. It will be a helpful reference and foundation for future planning. Complete the worksheet for each individual campaign.

Explore AUDIENCE TYPES (page 15) for sample messages TestCOMMUNICATION PLANNING PROCESS 3 ENDURING OUTBREAK CREATIVE CONCEPTSA root-cause analysis is an iterative, question- based technique for exploring the cause-effect relationships that underlie a particular problem. The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question \"why?\" Each question forms the basis of the next question.If an outbreak persists for longer than six months, it's most likely due to one or more underlying barriers. Addressing these barriers with tailored communication or programme changes is a necessary step in eliminating polio. However, identifying these hidden barriers can be complicated. Conducting a root cause analysis is a practical and effective method to simplify this process. The key is to trace the chain of causality to a root cause that is connected to the original problem. When possible, the middle links in the chain should be supported by data, but field-based hypotheses are also viable (and can be subject for investigation through further research). We think of root causes as barriers to achieving our desired behavioural objective. The root cause might be, for example, a broken process (health worker morale) or an alterable behaviour (mothers do not agree to vaccinate without consent of their husband), which can then be addressed directly to solve the original problem using customised communication. IDENTIFYING BARRIERS AND THEIR ROOT CAUSES \u00bb Not all problems have a single root cause. If one wishes to uncover multiple root causes, the method must be repeated asking a different sequence of questions each time. IN THIS SECTION: 5 Idenify the Problem 6 Analyse the Causes of Each Barrier 4 ENDURING OUTBREAKIdentifying barriers and root causes in Enduring Outbreaks is an essential strategic task you must complete before designing a communication campaign. This section of the guide provides guidance and a method of analysis that will aid you in discovering, understanding, and solving key barriers that are sustaining the Enduring Outbreak. In an Enduring Outbreak, the barriers to acceptance are likely to be specific to each community, culture, and region. They are also likely to be complex, with multiple causes that have individual, social, cultural, political, and environmental aspects. Because these barriers are likely to be both complex and unique, it is important to systematically understand them before exploring communication solutions. 5recent period of the outbreak. BARRIERS SHOULD BE STATED CLEARLY IN THE FORM OF A PROBLEM STATEMENT THAT CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS: Where are children being missed? Why? What is the underlying problem? Who is the audience involved in the problem? What data has led to the diagnosis of the problem? HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLE BARRIERS IN THE FORM OF PROBLEM STATEMENTS: Caregivers in high-risk communities are aware of polio (99% awareness) but do not know that the symptoms are incurable (70% believe symptoms are curable). Caregivers in rural communities deny access to health workers they see as outsiders (65% said the health worker who visited them was not from their community, 80% said the health worker was only somewhat trustworthy). SECOND: ANALYSE THE CAUSES OF EACH BARRIER \u00bb 1. IDENTIFY THE PROBLEM Diagnose the barriers using primary research conducted in the problem areas through campaign, epidemiological and social data, particularly KAP studies, using data for the most IDENTIFYING BARRIERS AND THEIR ROOT CAUSES 5 ENDURING OUTBREAK BARRIER ANALYSISBARRIERS AND THEIR ROOT CAUSES CONTINUED \u00bb USING THE ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFICATION TOOL The Root Causes Identification Tool will help you to document and visualise your analysis. The tool helps clarify the logical chain used to understand causes and any interdependencies between causes and barriers. Once the diagram is completed, it can serve as a quick reference for the issue you have identified through your research and analysis. Typically, a root cause will be revealed in five iterations. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION TOOL \u00bb REMEMBER: 1. Be persistent in your analysis: don't stop asking \"why?\" too soon. 2. Consult subject matter experts when necessary, presenting them with the analysis and asking them to help can often uncover causes that could otherwise be missed. 3. Support answers with programme data when possible to strengthen your analysis.2. ANALYSE THE CAUSES OF EACH BARRIER As previously discussed, the recommended method of analysis is known as \"root cause analysis.\" This method of analysis is simple and practical, and works by exploring the underlying chain of causes that result in a barrier. The goal is to identify root causes that have practical solutions. To effectively identify the root causes of a problem, use the ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION TOOL on page 7 . After you identify your problem, organise your search for root causes systematically by considering causal factors at each level of the SEM framework. As a result of this analysis, you will generate a thorough understanding of the key barriers at each level, what causes them, and the potential solutions.

CAUSE CAUSE CAUSE CAUSE CAUSE CAUSE Identify what's causing the problem by asking \"Why?\" Ex: Why? 80% of the communityis not concerned about polio.Write down a single issue in the form of a personal statement. Ex: 70% of the community thinks that giving oral polio vaccine is a \"somewhat good\" idea TIP: Every problem is dierent. It may take fewer, or even more causes to reach your root cause. Keep asking \"Why?\"TIP: Every problem is dierent. If you identify more than two causes, add more boxes. Continue to ask \"Why?\" until you can no longer answer the question. Ex: Why?70% of the community believes that the symptoms are curable. 4 STEP 4: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION Once you can no longer answer \"Why?\" you have reached the root cause. You now have a list of barriers that you can eectively act upon. Ex: Why?Traditional healers, a trusted source of medical information, tell them that most diseases are curable, and medicine is only for \"curative\" purposes.

When completing barrier and root causes analyses, it is important to consider your target audience. For more information about audiences, please refer to the next section, AUDIENCE ANALYSIS (page 9).

PROBLEM: 70% of the community thinks that giving oral polio is a \"somewhat good\" idea. 80% of the community is not concerned about polio.WHY? 70% of the community believes that the symptoms are curable. Traditional healers claim they have a cure.ROOT CAUSE: Discredited Message The communications we have deployed to inform people that polio symptoms are permanent have been ineective. Some caregivers are unable to read the posters we are using to reach them. The creative uses symbols of government authority, and these caregivers distrust the government. Caregivers heard identical messages from an untrusted source. ROOT CAUSE: Illiteracy ROOT CAUSE: Association with Distrusted ROOT Conflicting Knowledge 8 ENDURING OUTBREAK BARRIER ANALYSISIN THIS SECTION: 10 Accepters 11 Rejecters13 Transit Populations AUDIENCE GROUPS: ACCEPTERS, REJECTERS, & TRANSIT POPULATIONS This section will help you understand the three fundamental audience groups that your communication should target during Enduring Outbreaks: Accepters, Rejecters, and Transit Populations. What motivates people to say yes to the polio vaccination during an Enduring Outbreak? For many, the decision is simple and made early on in the outbreak. Their awareness of how close they are to the poliovirus and what they can do to prevent it is sufficient for them to accept the vaccine for their children. These individuals are Accepters. However, over the course of an Enduring Outbreak, repeated polio vaccine campaigns can test the patience and trust of caregivers. Therefore, it becomes very important to shift communication on themes beyond just awareness. REJECTERS Rejecters can become Accepters if their perceptions changeACCEPTERS Accepters can become Rejecters if their perceptions changeREMEMBER: 9 ENDURING OUTBREAKTHE ACCEPTER'S JOURNEY For more regarding the CAREGIVER'S JOURNEY see Global Guide, page 9. The Accepter's Journey is characterised by brevity and lack of resistance across the stages that result in successful vaccination. Awareness, Resonance, and Consideration all occur simultaenously, as messages around immunisation align to their existing opinions. They understand that vaccines are necessary, but they walk a thin line of becoming Rejecters if they do not trust or believe in the need for continued vaccination.ACCEPTERS The Accepters in Enduring Outbreaks have accepted the vaccine multiple times. This means that initial vaccination efforts have succeeded in persuading them of the importance of the vaccine. Accepters are sensitive to the threat that polio poses to their children, and they tend to trust authority figures when they request that their children continue taking the vaccine. Accepters in Enduring Outbreaks are more open to repeated vaccinations. KEY ISSUE FOR ACCEPTERSFatigue is the key issue for Accepters in Enduring Outbreaks. The length of an Enduring Outbreak will lead to very high numbers of vaccination contacts with health workers as campaigns accumulate. This repeated exposure might erode trust and belief in the vaccine. We must address this risk with adaptive, strategic communication. For information about developing adaptive communication see GUIDING PRINCIPLE THREE, Global Guide, page 13. D. HEALTH WORKER CONTACTA. AWARENESS B. RESONANCE C. CONSIDERATION E. VACCINATIONG. PEER-TO-PEER ADVOCACY F. REPEAT VACCINATION LOOP 10 ENDURING OUTBREAK MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, & EVALUATIONREJECTERS The second audience group is Rejecters. In an Enduring Outbreak, passive or active Rejecters become the primary focus of analysis, strategy, and communication. While Rejecters are typically a minority of the at-risk population, they can cause suspicions about vaccination in communities that provide a supportive and cultural environment for their disbeliefs. This social dynamic, coupled with low vaccination and immunity status, provides an enabling environment for a polio outbreak to persist or occur. While Rejecters are typically a minority of the at-risk population, they can cause suspicions about vaccination in communities that provide a supportive and cultural environment for their disbeliefs.Rejecters are defined by a reluctance to vaccinate their children during the initial outbreak or throughout the Enduring Outbreak. A Rejecter may reject every time or some of the time. They may reject overtly, or passively avoid vaccination or health workers. Their rejection has complex and intermingled root causes, and communication that worked well with Accepters may not have the same effect on Rejecters. It is therefore very important to understand the root cause of why a caregiver is rejecting the vaccine.During any situation\u2014outbreak, Enduring Outbreak, or Maintenance, opinions can shift. Accepters can become Rejecters if their perceptions change, and Rejecters can become Accepters if their perceptions change; however, this change from acceptance to rejection is particularly acute in an Enduring Outbreak context due to multiple rounds of vaccination and the duration of the outbreak. THE REJECTER'S JOURNEY For more regarding the CAREGIVER'S JOURNEY see Global Guide, page 9. The Rejecter's Journey is characterised by a failure at one or more of the stages of preceeding vaccination. Rejecter Journeys tend to be specific to local conditions and require a tailored, adaptive approach to communication and media channel selection. While mass media can provide an enabling environment to change perceptions, behaviour change is most likely to emerge from social mobilisation and interpersonal communication. Tailored messages delievered through the health worker contact stage can be used to overcome failures at the stages preceeding vaccination, and convert a Rejecter to an Accepter. See the INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION SECTION (page 24 ) for guidance on IPC messages and approaches for Rejecters.D. HEALTH WORKER CONTACTC. CONSIDERATIONB. RESONANCEA. AWARENESS NO REPEAT VACCINATION 11 AUDIENCE ANALYSIS ENDURING OUTBREAK Low literacy and education rates might impede communication from effectively informing Rejecters about polio and can also support rumours or other alternative explanations that can be harmful. They might heed traditional, cultural, or religious understandings of medicine over scientific understandings. This might mean that the concept of preventative medical care, including vaccines, must be explained differently to resonate. They might actively distrust the institutions, organisations, and individuals that polio communication come from, including their national government, ministry of health, UNICEF, WHO, or other international organisations. They might have an established habit of only seeking medical care after something is painful or obviously wrong, and they might not have the notion or understanding of incurable, yet preventable, diseases like polio. Their refusal might be outright, or it might be disguised through nonparticipation (refusing to answer the door or bring their child to the health centre), or through a falsely reported absence of their child. KEY FACTORS FOR REJECTERS: The decision to vaccinate is complicated and risky. Rejecters may be influenced by uncertainty and rumours about the benefits and dangers of polio vaccine. They may be more challenged to satisfy basic needs, such as food, water, shelter, power security, and safety, and they may prioritise these over vaccination, especially after exposure to repeated campaigns providing only polio vaccine. They might be prohibited from getting the vaccine by local social and cultural norms. They might not perceive their family members, neighbours, community leaders, religious leaders, or other influencers to be in support of vaccinating children against polio. In extreme circumstances, they may be witnesses to acts of violence from others within their community over the vaccine or the programme.

Where possible, with government assistance, child immunisation should be made a prerequisite for international travel and border crossings, regardless of where they are heading. In all other scenarios, transient populations must be reached with tailored communication. With Transit Populations, we must consider the best ways we can reach and vaccinate them. Making this happen typically requires media at key transit points or routes that are commonly travelled by nomadic and pastoralist communities. It also depends heavily on interpersonal communication to succeed with an interaction that involves a caregiver who is typically rushed, unprepared, and perhaps unwilling to receive a health service at this time, particularly if they have received the same service multiple times before. These transient, potentially displaced individuals are a case of \"strangers in a strange land,\" and we have the opportunity to resonate with them if our messages recognise their place of origin, their destination, or their purpose for traveling. Brand familiarity is an important source of trust that should be used in communication at transit points. 13 AUDIENCE ANALYSIS ENDURING OUTBREAKKEY FACTORS FOR TRANSIT POPULATIONS Use appropriate media channels, such as: Booths at major transit or migratory locations. Health services coupled with veterinary services for pastoralist or nomadic groups. Mobile vans displaying communication materials. City buses or railways. SMS and voice messaging services targeted to those who travel with mobile phones, particularly those who use them for livelihood. Other outdoor media in public spaces, such as railway stations, buses, bus stops, markets, dairy booths, banks, and schools. Utilise multipurpose communication, such as brochures that can be folded into small toys for children. Consider other materials that can be offered as \"give away\" incentives to those on the move. Communication needs to be tailored to reflect the Transit Populations culture and country of origin. If polio was an issue in their place of origin, synchronise messages and branding with place of origin and/or place of travel. Identify and use spokespeople and sources they consider credible to build trust. Transit Populations may be less familiar with polio, so it is important to introduce vaccination as a critical regional health issue. They may be less familiar with polio vaccination, so it is important to introduce vaccination as a critical social norm within their community, which may consist of other nomadic groups, tribes, or labour communities. If possible and when appropriate, bundle polio vaccination with other messages about desired health services. 14 ENDURING OUTBREAK AUDIENCE ANALYSISAUDIENCE TYPES There are two main types of audiences in our communication: Caregivers and Influencers. CAREGIVERS Caregivers are the family members who can make the decision to accept or reject vaccination for their children. The CAREGIVER CHARTS on page 16- 17 outline the role of caregivers in an Enduring Outbreak.INFLUENCERS Influencers consist of the key individuals who exert an influence on the caregivers at the different levels of the SEM FRAMEWORK (see Global Guide, page 15. They can include the elders, religious and community leaders, political figures, and other members of society. It can be useful to target, address, and engage secondary audiences that influence caregivers. The following INFLUENCER CHARTS on pages 18-23 outline the influencer audience types and common profiles to provide an overview of how they can be included in Enduring Outbreak communication. These charts are derived from the SEM framework but focused specifically on audiences that can directly influence the caregiver. Caregivers are the primary audience because they typically make the decision to accept or reject vaccination. 15 AUDIENCE ANALYSIS ENDURING OUTBREAKTYPE AUDIENCECAREGIVERS (1/2) FATHERS MOTHERSELDERS, GRANDPARENTS, & OTHER RELATIVESTRANSIENT CAREGIVERS OVERVIEW DESIRED ROLE POTENTIAL CONCERNSFathers or Mothers play a distinct cultural role, and in some societies they may be the key decision-maker behind access and vaccination, inside their household as well as within a community at large. It may make sense to approach them dierently, or even seperately, as their cultural roles and influence may dier based on gender and family role.Health is typically a private matter kept within the family and relevant professionals. Relatives can be an important influence on caregivers, and in some cases may be the nal decision-makers for their entire family.Transient caregivers assume similar roles as nontransient caregivers concerning the decision to vaccinate but require a dierent approach because they do not have a permanent home and are more dicult to reach. Allow access to and vaccination of vulnerable children under the age of ve . Approve of vaccination and vocally advocate for it within the family, and to the other families they may be in transit with. Polio may not have been an issue from their place of origin. Vaccination may not have been socially promoted in their place of origin.Approve of vaccination and vocally advocate for it within the family. Connect and spread pro-vaccination information through extended family networks. Older relatives may have traditional or cultural views that bias them against vaccine and perceptions of polio as a threat, and they may buy into rumours that position polio as a primarily foreign concern, rather than a local concern.Allow access to and vaccination of vulnerable children in the target group. Influence other parents in the community to also vaccinate by openly approving of vaccination. Dismiss influencers who reject vaccination eorts. Anti-campaign pressure from influencers or rumours within their community that could turn compliant caregivers into rejecters General apathy toward vaccination eorts. 16 ENDURING OUTBREAK AUDIENCE ANALYSIS: AUDIENCE TYPESTYPE AUDIENCECAREGIVERS (2/2) FATHERS MOTHERSELDERS, GRANDPARENTS, & OTHER RELATIVESTRANSIENT CAREGIVERS ENGAGEMENT FOCUS SAMPLE MESSAGESSame as nontransient caregivers, but specically: Introduce polio as a critical regional issue.

To protect your child, vaccinate them at the border or a regional health camp. Sample 2: Polio is a serious problem in [Country A]; the only way to continually protect our children from polio is to routinely vaccinate them. Sample 3: Polio is a dangerous disease that does not respect borders. Vaccinate your child at the border or a regional health camp. Sample 4: Don't let polio be your travel companion.Sample 1: All our children will be safe the day every child is vaccinated with polio drops. Make our futures strong. Vaccinate your child, for the good of all children. Sample 2: When all the children are vaccinated, polio cannot spread. So help make our children strong and vaccinate your child, for the good of all children. Sample 3: For polio to stop making our children ill, we must continue to vaccinate. This will protect our children until the virus is no longer detected in local water, where it can live and keep infecting new unvaccinated children. That's why we keep bringing the vaccine, and it's good for your child to continue taking it as a precaution.To support immunisation days and campaigns, deliver the essential information to caregivers (the \"when, where how, and what\" for each campaign). Remind caregivers of the importance and necessity of routine vaccination.Target and address persistent and/or emerging negative social perceptions and norms with compelling counter narratives leveraging descriptive norms.

Communities can vary in type and size, but to ensure message ecacy it is important to address the specic need and values of their members. Collective investment in eradication through cultural and social norms that frame vaccination and health workers positively and provide social/cultural permission for wives, daughters, and grand- daughters to join the programme.

Exacerbation of anticampaign and antivaccination rumours.Traditional healers may have traditional or cultural views and practises that bias them against vaccination, as well as skew their perceptions of polio as a threat. As trusted members of their communities, they are particularly harmful if spreading rumours about vaccines.Individual leaders may not possess the trust of their communities and support for vaccination could be seen as negative. Leaders could also directly work against vaccination themselves; they may have a political agenda that conflicts with the polio programme's goals.Despite campaign eorts, educators may have traditional or cultural views that bias them against vaccine and perceptions of polio as a threat. 18 ENDURING OUTBREAK AUDIENCE ANALYSIS: AUDIENCE TYPESTYPE AUDIENCEINFLUENCER: COMMUNITY (2/2) EDUCATORSCOMMUNITY & RELIGIOUS LEADERSTRADITIONAL HEALERSCOMMUNITIES AT LARGE MESSAGING FOCUS SAMPLE MESSAGESSupport their role and acknowledge the trust and importance they have within their community.

Mass media elements are unidirectional and are unable to adapt to the audience's needs and concerns in the moment. THE SEVEN IPC THEMES 1. Repeated Campaigns 2. Belief that Oral Polio Vaccine is Unsafe 3. Belief that Oral Polio Vaccine is Ineffective4. Campaign Mistrust5. Children are Not Available (Absent, Newborn, Sick, Sleeping) 6. Belief that Polio is Curable7. Vaccine-Driven Poliovirus (VDPV) The following themes represent complex barriers that mass media tactics are not best suited to overcome. Within the themes are interpersonal-based solutions and key messages that could be delivered by a health worker or social mobiliser. Importantly, these themes should be incorporated into all frontline health worker trainings. Interpersonal communication on the other hand, is dynamic; it can be tailored to the individual's specific needs and can effectively address caregiver-specific barriers. 24 ENDURING OUTBREAKCOMMUNICATION APPROACH 1. Empathise with their frustration before explaining the reason behind repeated campaigns in a neutral way. 2. Listen to their response. 3.

I can see how you'd feel this way. I felt this way, too, but I found that it's a good thing that we continue to protect our children against polio together. It turns out that for polio to stop making our children ill, we must continue to vaccinate. This will protect our children until the virus is no longer detected in local water, where it can live and keep infecting new unvaccinated children for almost six months. That's why we keep bringing the vaccine, and it turns out to be good for your child to continue taking it as a precaution. If we all work together to protect everyone, we can eliminate the disease entirely. Please help us, and please help your friends and family understand this.INFLUENCER MESSAGES (We are assuming we will only engage influencers who personally support the vaccine) Introduce yourself to the influencer, including your name, role and origin, and who you know in the area who would be known to the influencer. 1. How many times will we come? We will keep going until polio is gone from here. We know we can do it because we've removed it completely from many other countries in the world and in most parts of our country. It turns out that for polio to be stopped entirely, we must continue to protect our children until the virus is no longer detected in local water, where it can live and keep infecting newborns and unvaccinated children for almost six months between active cases. Until it's completely gone, every new child is at risk, and polio can easily come back into our community through a vulnerable child. That's why we must come so often. If we all work together to protect everyone, we can eliminate the disease entirely.

Empathise with their concerns to defuse negative emotions they may have surrounding the vaccine\u2014especially fear, uncertainty, and doubt. 2.

If necessary, offer to take some of the vaccine yourself, to show that it is only helpful, not harmful. CAREGIVER & INFLUENCER MESSAGES \u00bbPROBLEM 1. We have frequently communicated the safety of the vaccine, so a persistent belief that the vaccine is unsafe indicates that our message was not received, not trusted if it was received, or that a rumour is creating enough uncertainty to make normal safety messages ineffective.BELIEF THAT ORAL POLIO VACCINE IS UNSAFEINTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION THEME 2 27 ENDURING OUTBREAK INTERPERSONAL ENGAGEMENT & KEY MESSAGESBELIEF THAT VACCINE IS UNSAFE CONTINUED \u00bb CAREGIVER MESSAGES Introduce yourself to the caregiver, including your name, role, and origin and who you know in the area who would be known to the caregiver. 1. I can see how you would feel this way. I've felt this way, too, with the children in my family. But then I found out that it is actually completely safe, and I've never seen any child get ill from taking the vaccine. The worst thing that can happen is a slight fever, which is normal and a sign that the body is using the vaccine to become immune to polio. 2. We've been giving the vaccine for years in this [community/village/neighbourhood/city/area], and all of the children are fine. If you think about it, you already know so many people who take it whenever we come by, and they don't have any problems. You probably know most of them very well, too, your [community leaders] and [religious leaders] have also given their children this exact vaccine, and they are perfectly healthy. That's because we all know that it is completely safe. We're fortunate that there is such an easy way to prevent this disease. It is a wonderful thing. 3. Giving the vaccine doesn't just protect your children, it actually will help us completely stop polio from harming the children in our community forever. If you'd like, I can take some of the vaccine right now with your child. It's only helpful, there's no risk at all to anyone from taking it. INFLUENCER MESSAGES (We are assuming we will only engage influencers who personally support the vaccine) Introduce yourself to the Influencer, including your name, role, and origin and who you know in the area who would be known to the influencer. 1. How many people in your community have taken vaccines, including you and your family? And no one has ever gotten sick because they are perfectly safe. Taking them is just normal. And when we give them to all our children, we can protect all of our families and the entire community from disease. We're fortunate that there is such an easy way to prevent this disease and that we have access to it. It is a wonderful thing. 2. Some people seem to worry that the vaccine is unsafe. That's okay; it's good to worry about your children and their health. We want them to know that it is safe, and that nothing bad ever happens to the children to whom we give the vaccine. They can see the proof: We have given it to children in the community before, and those children are perfectly healthy and polio-free. We hope that you will help us by talking to your family, friends, neighbours, [and community/religious following if applicable], about how safe the vaccine is and how they actually do know so many people who have taken it.INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION THEME 2: BELIEF THAT ORAL POLIO VACCINE IS UNSAFE 28 ENDURING OUTBREAK INTERPERSONAL ENGAGEMENT & KEY MESSAGESPROBLEM To ensure that a child is protected, they must receive multiple doses of OPV. In ideal scenarios, three doses through routine immunisation are effective to protect children. But to eradicate a disease, more doses are required, depending on the strength of the child's immune system and environmental conditions. COMMUNICATION APPROACH 1. Ask caregivers why they believe the vaccine is ineffective. 2. Empathise with the caregiver to defuse any tensions that disagreement with their belief may cause. 3. Explain that the vaccine is effective, but that every child is different and some children need less and most children need more vaccine to be fully protected, which is why some people believe the vaccine is ineffective. 4. If the caregiver doesn't understand how vaccines are effective in general, use simple metaphors to explain the notion of preventing illness. 5. If the caregiver cannot be persuaded, ask them for their trust and willingness to give the vaccine as just a precaution. CAREGIVER MESSAGES \u00bbBELIEF THAT ORAL POLIO VACCINE IS INEFFECTIVE INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION THEME 3 29 ENDURING OUTBREAK INTERPERSONAL ENGAGEMENT & KEY MESSAGES5. As you can imagine, it's hard to vaccinate everyone in an entire village, let alone a big city or an entire country. But we've been successful, and we've protected so many children by doing this all together; when it comes to diseases and illnesses, we're all fighting them together. The vaccine becomes so much more effective once everyone has it because it becomes harder for polio to find unprotected children to pass through. 6. Since there's no risk here, I can take a few drops right now. If you want to watch, they are totally safe. May we give them to your child just to be safe? Because that's the funny thing about vaccines: when they work, disease is prevented, so it's worth being safe and taking them. 7. To ensure the vaccine works as best as it possibly can, your child needs to be strong enough to fight infections. Wash hands with soap to prevent diarrhea, get your full routine immunisation to ensure he/she is protected from all other diseases, and feed him good, nutritious food, together with breastfeeding until two years of age.

I understand how you feel, and I thought about that, too. But then I found out that the vaccine is more effective taken more times, and you have to give it as many times as you can to get the best protection. That's why we come by so frequently. 3. It really depends on your child, and every child is a little different, especially when it comes to health. Some never seem to get sick, even when they are newborns, and some seem to always need more help fighting off fevers and illnesses. The vaccine works the same way, but it's okay because it's safe to take it many times. In any case, with any child, it's safest to take it every time we are here.

Has anyone ever mentioned that they think the polio vaccine just doesn't work? What did they say? Why do you think they feel that way? 2. The polio vaccine actually does work, but sometimes children who are a little weaker need more doses to be fully protected, so sometimes people believe that it simply doesn't work. I can see why they would come to that conclusion. It actually can take many doses to give complete protection, which is why we come here so often. It's not worth the risk of catching polio when taking the vaccine is easy, free, and safe. 3. It really depends on the child, and every child is a little different, especially when it comes to health. Some never seem to get sick, even when they are newborns, and some seem to always need more help fighting off fevers and illnesses; it's the same with the vaccine, so to be safe, we need your help. Please talk with your friends, neighbours, and family, and tell them we are happy to talk to them and to listen to them about their concerns. It's okay to have questions about vaccines for children, and we want to help. 4. How might we get better at talking to people in your community about the vaccine's effectiveness?INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION THEME 3: BELIEF THAT ORAL POLIO VACCINE IS INEFFECTIVE 31 ENDURING OUTBREAK INTERPERSONAL ENGAGEMENT & KEY MESSAGESPROBLEM 1. The polio programme is ubiquitous, and campaigns are frequent. More individuals experience contact with the campaign than experience contact with polio or its symptoms. The comparative rareness of the disease means that the cause of the vaccination activities is not always known and immediate to individuals on a firsthand basis. Instead, they must learn about it through communication and their community, rather than firsthand observation. 2. The poor information environment leads to natural scepticism and distrust of official narratives, especially when they do not explain their origins, agendas, and owners in detail. 3. Regional insecurity and instability exacerbate trust issues by making scepticism and suspicion rational and normal.4. Rumours and competing explanations are entertained and accepted when they are both unchallenged and emotionally satisfying. 5. Beliefs about corruption may have a basis in fact, giving additional credibility to rumours and mistrust. This will be especially true if the government has a history of censorship and control of news, journalism, and mass media within the region. In some cases, this effect is so extreme that foreign and international sources of information might be more credible than local and domestic sources. 6. Providing the correct information is only one part of the solution to correcting misbeliefs and rumours. CONTINUED \u00bbCAMPAIGN MISTRUSTINTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION THEME 4 32 ENDURING OUTBREAK INTERPERSONAL ENGAGEMENT & KEY MESSAGESCOMMUNICATION APPROACH The information provided via IPC must reframe the campaigns as trustworthy, using information that is credible coming directly from a health worker or social mobiliser. Make the right introduction. The health worker/social mobiliser must introduce himself or herself, explain who they are, where they are from, and who they know in common with the caregiver within the community. If the health worker has an ID card, he or she should show the card (provided it is associated with a trusted entity, i.e., the Ministry of Health or the GPEI). This establishes their personal trustworthiness and credibility and gives the caregiver a sense of control, as they will be able to verify the health worker/social mobiliser's credibility through someone they trust. 1. Convey that the campaign is the standard approach to polio outbreaks and has been implemented safely in the past and in other countries. 2. Emphasise that this information was acquired personally through access the health worker/social mobiliser had during training. 3. Emphasise that the people behind the programme are known and trusted by the health worker/social mobiliser. CAREGIVER & INFLUENCER MESSAGES \u00bb\u00bb CAMPAIGN MISTRUST, PROBLEM CONTINUED 7. By itself, information is often insufficient when mistrust is prevalent. 8. Trust begins with the credibility of the source, not the correctness of the information. A sceptical individual will carefully consider the source before deciding to trust the information itself. 9. Multiple factors influence the perception of credibility: a. Is the source known to the individual (e.g., a well-known and trusted brand, company, or individual) or unknown? b. Does the source have firsthand, special, or eyewitness knowledge of the information that is being communicated? c. Does the information have sufficient detail? d. Would it have been difficult to manipulate or distort the information? 10. Simply denying rumours and contradictions is inadequate, as the lack of trust means the new information is not credible, whether correct or not.INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION THEME 4: CAMPAIGN MISTRUST 33 ENDURING OUTBREAK INTERPERSONAL ENGAGEMENT & KEY MESSAGESINFLUENCER MESSAGES Introduce yourself to the influencer, including your name, role, and origin and who you know in the area who would be known to the influencer. 1. Some people seem worried that the polio campaigns aren't just about vaccinating children against polio, and they are confused. They think there is something else going on. That's not the truth, though. The truth is that the campaigns are just completely ordinary. I know, as I've seen that we use the same training and methods that older campaigns in other countries have used. It's almost exactly the same, everywhere. That's because it works; it's a difficult and big effort to vaccinate all of the children in our area, so we need to be really organised and consistent. As long as we keep going, we'll keep getting closer to completely protecting our children against polio, forever. And once that happens, we can stop the campaigns. It's as simple as that.\u00bb CAMPAIGN MISTRUST CONTINUED CAREGIVER MESSAGES Introduce yourself to the caregiver, including your name, role, and origin and who you know in the area who would be known to the caregiver. 1. I understand what you're saying, but that's not the truth. These campaigns are actually completely ordinary, and the way we do them here is similar to how they have been conducted everywhere else in the world. We actually use similar training and the same vaccine\u2014I've seen all of this myself when I started helping with the campaigns by talking to parents about polio and vaccination against polio. The campaigns have been the same for decades because they work. It's all very ordinary. You can ask any of us - we've all seen the same thing during our training and when we go and get the vaccines. For everyone who works on these campaigns, it's a job and a big effort. But we know it's worth it because together, we can protect children. We're here to help, and with your help we can ensure that your children, the children in this community, and children across the world are protected from polio. INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION THEME 4: CAMPAIGN MISTRUST 34 ENDURING OUTBREAK INTERPERSONAL ENGAGEMENT & KEY MESSAGESPROBLEM The cause for the unavailability needs to be understood on an individual basis in order to give the correct response and, on a collective basis, to understand whether there is a broader pattern of unavailability that requires an additional intervention to address, beyond one-to-one IPC communication. 1. It is also possible that claims of child unavailability are a \"soft\" refusal of the vaccine, made with the intent of avoiding direct confrontation. a. If so, ignoring this desire to avoid confrontation communicates a lack of empathy for the caregiver, which may harden their refusal into outright rejection. b. At the same time, simply taking their word for it may further incentivise \"soft\" refusals within a community or area, if it becomes known that these kinds of refusals will go unchallenged. c. Further complicating matters, the truthfulness of a claim of unavailability may be difficult or impossible to discern in the moment.COMMUNICATION APPROACH Gently probe into the issue to see if the caregiver is willing to explain further, and ask them to suggest a time that would work for them to create a sense of reciprocity within your conversation. 1. Inform them that they and their children have the right to the vaccine, which is being provided free of charge, and that they are missing their chances to receive it when their children are unavailable. Ask them when their children will be home so they can return to vaccinate them. 2. If regional security allows, provide the caregiver with further information on when health workers will visit, as well as alternative places and ways (health camps and other healthcare facilities) to get the vaccine. 3. Ask them to talk to their neighbours about the vaccine and the days the health workers are coming as well.

I'm sorry to hear that your children aren't around. It's all right, we will be returning [insert date] to try again. You and your children have the right to these vaccines, free of charge, so it's important that we find a time when they can get them. Otherwise, they won't be getting what is fair for them, and what they need to protect them - and your family - from polio. May I ask where they are and why they couldn't be here to get their vaccines? Is there anything we can do to ensure they are protected? What is a better time for us to return to protect your child? 2. When would be a good time for us to come back? Is there a period of time when your children are typically home? 3. Would you be willing to discuss this with your family, friends, and neighbours? We want everyone to know his or her rights, and we want everyone to take advantage of this service, which is being provided at no charge. Note: If communities are offering alternative times that would be more convenient for them, make sure there is a way for this information to reach programme managers who can alter microplans for the next round.INFLUENCER MESSAGES Introduce yourself to the Influencer, including your name, role, and origin and who you know in the area who would be known to the influencer. 1. Some of the parents in your area have been telling us their children aren't around when we come with vaccines for polio. We worry they don't understand that they and their children have a right to these medicines, and that they are going to miss their chance because it isn't clear when they need to be home to get them. Would you be willing to talk to your community about this and let them know that they need to have their children there so they can receive what is rightfully theirs? 2. We are also open to coming by at different times, if it would be more convenient for some parents. When do you think would be the best time? INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION THEME 5: CHILDREN ARE NOT AVAILABLE 36 ENDURING OUTBREAK INTERPERSONAL ENGAGEMENT & KEY MESSAGESPROBLEM 1. Caregivers may believe that polio is curable, especially if they have seen someone exhibit key symptoms from which they recovered while receiving care. 2. Although polio is not curable, children do sometimes recover from the symptoms, and it is natural for people to assume that all paralysis is the same, implying that polio is curable. 3. These experiences, whether firsthand or hearsay from trusted sources, provide a credible basis for the incorrect belief to caregivers that cannot be refuted simply.COMMUNICATION APPROACH 1. Empathise with the caregiver and gently probe them about their belief that polio is curable and the reasons they believe it. 2. If their belief is based on anecdotes of recoveries from polio, do not tell them they are wrong, or that the stories they have heard are false. Instead, express amazement and gratitude for the miraculous recovery of those children. 3. Explain that it takes a miracle to recover from polio, and that in all your time working as health worker, you have never seen this happen. 4. Within that context, we should all hope for miracles for the sick, but it's more reliable to take action and protect children through vaccination, instead of leaving it to chance. 5. If they simply hold erroneous beliefs, provide correct information without disagreeing with them directly or telling them that they are wrong.

[If beliefs are based on anecdotes of recovery] That is amazing, and we should all be thankful for such a miraculous recovery. Thank you for sharing that story with me. I wish that all children could be so blessed. If they were, then I would not need to do this work, and I could turn toward other things. Unfortunately, most children are not so lucky, and it's far safer to vaccinate children and give them certain protection than to risk their paralysis by hoping and praying for a miracle. That's why we must be vigilant. 3. [Otherwise] I understand how you feel, and I thought about that, too. But then I found out that very few children are lucky enough to recover from those effects of the disease and that home remedies and other medicines don't work reliably.

I understand why someone would feel that way, and it's good to be hopeful. But the truth is that very few children recover from the symptoms, and home remedies and medicines simply don't work. It's pretty much a miracle when a child makes a good recovery, and we would be truly lucky if it happened more often. Unfortunately, most are not so lucky, and it's far safer to vaccinate children and give them certainty in their protection against polio than to risk their paralysis by hoping and praying for a miracle. 3. Together, I hope we can spread this message: don't rely on miracles when there's a safer way. Vaccinate your children. 4.

If this occurs AND there are enough unvaccinated children within the area, it is possible that an outbreak will occur.COMMUNICATION APPROACH VDPV outbreaks are addressed in exactly the same manner as other outbreaks, and sufficient vaccination coverage of children is the key to ending the outbreak. As such, there is no need to actively communicate about VDPV specifically, unless knowledge of VDPV is a specific source of refusals and people begin to believe that the vaccine is unsafe because of it. 1. In such a case, it must be emphasised that VDPV is only a threat to children who have not been vaccinated, and that properly vaccinating children with all antigens affords them complete protection against all diseases, including wild poliovirus and VDPV.

It is ideal to state goals in simple and direct language. The goal is also how we can measure our success, so it should link to specific criteria, like frequency of behaviour. It's critical to understand why people aren't already perceiving or behaving how we desire, as stated in the goal section.

When reviewing media channel performance, also consider what publicity the programme has received and how it has assisted or hindered the programme's progress. This will determine whether your media strategy should adopt a high-or-low visibility approach. By using the ROOT CAUSES IDENTIFICATION TOOL (page 7) and the COMMUNICATION PLANNING WORKSHEET (page 41 ), you should have already identified the barriers that remain and determined how best to address them with messaging. The next step is to identify which specific media channels are most effective in getting caregivers to either allow health workers in the home or take their children to the clinics or camps where vaccination occurs. MEDIA CHANNEL PLANNING \u00bb 44 ENDURING OUTBREAKCOST OF USING THE CHANNEL Which channels are more cost- effective to use than others? Radio versus TV?EFFECTIVENESS OF THE CHANNEL What channels were most effective in changing behaviour over the last six to 12 months? Have you done any survey or focus group work to determine this? Which channels showed the quickest \"wear-out\" (i.e., failure to resonate or engage the audience)? Did the messaging no longer resonate with caregivers because of the message, creative execution, or the media channel?When planning your communication, you should identify your intended population's preferred channels and media use, the objectives for using each channel, as well as their capacity for passing on information within our target population's social network. Answer the following questions to determine media channel planning in an Enduring Outbreak. CHANNEL TARGETING Are some channels better for reaching rural populations? Urban targets?

This campaign can be useful in settings where the health workers are unfamiliar or have low trust from target populations.WE ARE ALL INTERTWINED The We Are Intertwined campaign may be used to leverage the supportive social norms, values, and messages that promote repeated vaccination to incite collective action and community protection. This concept may be useful in settings where the social support system for repeated vaccination is weak, or if individual families are growing tired of repeated campaigns.There are two conceptual territories to use as a basis for creating mass communication in Enduring Outbreaks. Each looks at health workers and children's health from a slightly different perspective and can be tailored to address particular issues more directly. Which campaign you would choose will depend largely on the audience barriers that you have identified. 48 ENDURING OUTBREAKThe core of this concept is the idea that immunisation and children's health are shared community obligations and that the community remains strong only if every child is protected. It depicts the positive behaviour of immunisation support and acceptance. Drawing inspiration from the rich tradition of textiles in many of the at-risk regions, it takes the metaphor of community as fabric and uses it to illustrate our interconnectedness, and the superior value of a collective gain. WE ARE ALL INTERTWINED In other media, the metaphor is extended by showing other kinds of interrelationships and connectivity, such as a truck driver who is connected to others through his travel or a brick worker connecting bricks to build a strong foundation for a home. In these stories, we also have the ability to depict the health worker in a very positive heroic light so as to remove any barriers to acceptance and access. The goal is to socially normalise immunisation by emphasising the collective responsibility to vaccinate every child for the good of all children.SELECTION CHECKLIST \u00a3 General appeal for the importance of immunisation \u00a3 Overcome fatigue from perception of too many immunisation campaigns \u00a3 Overcome antivaccination sentiments \u00a3 Shift from a sense of individual responsibility to communal responsibility and protection WE ARE ALL INTERTWINED 49 ENDURING OUTBREAK CREATIVE CONCEPTSThis concept uses the metaphor of a brick wall to bring to life the importance of communal strength and responsibility.

This television commercial was produced in Pakistan and addresses the Pashtun audience in the highest-risk areas. The commercial metaphorically links to building a strong foundation for a house with the actions necessary to build a strong community.

RATIONALE Having met our characters in the context of weaving, we now shift to expanding our understanding of them to include the role of the health worker via the cooler. This firmly establishes the health worker as being a member of the community both literally (she's part of a group that is depicted on screen) and figuratively. We use her transition from a private space to a public one to talk about the work they do to strengthen the community and to frame the effort as being in the service of protecting children.

If you look at health workers solely through their role, you will be less likely to listen to them than if you have a bit of context. This concept creates a context of trust around the health workers by humanising them. In mass media, we meet them through their background and interests and then pivot to their roles as health workers.

The method(s) selected to monitor a programme will depend on the purpose of the programme, the users of the findings, the resources available to collect data, the accessibility of study participants, the type of information (e.g., generalisable or descriptive), and the relative advantages or disadvantages of the method(s). All programme monitoring should aim to use mixed methods (i.e., a combination of quantitative and qualitative research) to capture multiple facets of programme outcomes and to triangulate the findings. Source: UNICEF, MNCHN C4D Guide Model 2: http://www.unicef.org/cbsc/index_65738.html2. PREPARE AN OPERATIONAL PLAN How will you collect the data for each indicator? What are your source(s)? Who will collect the data and when? What are the costs? When outlining your plan, be mindful of ethical practices of ensuring the privacy and security of information regarding programme participants. 3. DEVELOP MONITORING DATA COLLECTION TEMPLATES Create or adapt the tools that programme staff will use to conduct monitoring activities. For example: Detailed Case Investigation forms, Special Investigation Forms adapting the Global Forms Independent Monitoring forms, adapting the Global Guidelines and Forms Campaign Observation checklists Weekly brief survey questionnaires, using RapidPro or other technology if available Audience Assessment surveys Quarterly focus group discussions or other qualitative or anthropological research Knowledge Attitudes and Practices Studies (KAP) using Harvard Polling questionnaire and methods, if appropriate 69 ENDURING OUTBREAK MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, & EVALUATION: KEY ACTION STEPS4. DEVELOP A DATA ANALYSIS APPROACH Describe what information will be analysed, how, by whom, and by what dates. It is helpful to create dummy tables for the data analysis. 5. DEVELOP MONITORING REPORTING TEMPLATES Create easy-to-use reporting forms that are mindful of the time it will take to complete and read. The format should be concise so that the information can be readily interpreted and acted upon. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative has several dashboards that exist for outbreak contexts that you should consult first. 6. DEVELOP A MECHANISM FOR USING MONITORING REPORTS TO SUPPORT ON-GOING PROGRAMME ACTIVITIES Create a process for reviewing monitoring reports, discussing them with staff, partners, and stakeholders as necessary, and delegating tasks to address any issue that are detected through the monitoring activities. This may be done through Communication Taskforces or other forums.7. WRITE A REPORT ON THE FINDINGS AFTER EACH CAMPAIGN OR QUARTER Communicating results effectively is critical if they are to be used for advocacy and re-planning. The narrative should be supported by graphics and illustrations to help the reader understand the findings. Translate the report into local languages as necessary to ensure the data reaches all critical stakeholders, particularly those who are implementing strategies at sub-national levels.8. DISSEMINATE RESULTS Share and discuss monitoring evaluation results with relevant partners, donors, and all stakeholders, communities, and programme/study participants as appropriate. Programme staff should seek out opportunities to convey evaluation results via briefings, websites, e-mails, bulletins, listserves, press releases, journal articles, conference presentations, and other appropriate forums. In order for the findings to be most useful, you should make sure that they are communicated using formats that fit the needs of the recipients. 70 ENDURING OUTBREAK MEASUREMENT, MONITORING, & EVALUATION: KEY ACTION STEPS "}
