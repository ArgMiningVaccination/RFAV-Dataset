EXECUTIVE SUMMARY A US -UK Funders and Researchers Workshop was held in the US on 1 -3 June 2015. It was co -funded and facilitated by the Biotechnology and Biological Sc iences Research Council (BBSRC); the National Institute of Food and Agricu lture (NIFA), United States Departmen t of Agriculture (USDA); the Research Council UK (RCUK) Washington; and the UK Science and Innovation Network (SIN) - Houston. The University of Maryland -College Park also facilitated. In general, there was great enthusiasm from both US and UK attendees for joint partnership and an opportunity to bring together two large research entities in the world with complementary strengths to address some of the major issue s in animal health and w elfare. The works hop had two parts. During part one , 33 scientists (22 US; 11 UK) identified potential areas for cross -country collaborations in: vaccinology for animal health and food safety; antimicrobial alternat ives to current an timicrobials and antiparasitic s; emerging & re - emerging animal pathogens, including zoonoses; and animal welfare. Six US Federal agencies (USDA - NIFA; USDA -Agricultural Research Service ; National Science Foundation (NSF) ; National Institutes of Health (NIH) ; Depart ment of Homeland Security (DHS) ; US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ) and 3 UK agencies ( BBSRC; RCUK Washington; UK -SIN Houston) also attended and summarized their portfolios. A SWOT ( Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis w as done for the four workshop topics. Researchers highlighted that US -UK collaboration builds on a history of successful collaboration in the topic area and provides a unique oppor tunity to exploit biodiversity and the unique agricultural and management models in both countries as a way to develop agri-system resilience in both countries . Scientists in both coun tries noted insufficient resources to address the workshop topics; working cross-country could significantly leverage limited funding for mutual U S-UK benefits. Participants identified over 70 research topics for potential collaboration of which 26 {Diagnostics, data modeling, ant iparasitic resistance, immunology , /wellbeing and microbiome linking to immunology } were identified as high impact and high need f or transatlantic collaboration. There were two research topics which were considered to be low impact but participant s expressed high need for collaboration (Emerging pathogens of unknown clinical significance and tick-borne diseases) . The group also identified two areas for joint US -UK networking activity: microbiome as marker for health , welfare and disease and animal behaviour as a predictor of disease outbreak . Following that classification, u sing the research topics as a starting point, twenty -one short -, medium - and long -term deliverables were identified that are ripe for impactful US -UK collaboration. Scientists responding to a post workshop survey judged pa rt one of the meeting to be excellent to very good. Part 2 was a closed funders meeting (USDA -NIFA; NSF; NIH ; DHS; FDA BBSRC; UK -SIN; RCUK). N ext steps towards development of a strategic framework for multi -year collaborations around the workshop themes w ere confidentially discussed and will be continued outside of the workshop. 3 2. BACKGROUND Building on the high quality science base in the US and UK, BBSRC and USDA -NIFA launched a joint pilot call (request for applications) in 2014 to support research of high strategic relevance to both countries in areas of Animal Health & Disease, including Veterinary Immune Reagents. There was an overwhelming response from both US and UK communities to this call (including 51 letters of intent to submit proposals); some very strong US -UK research partnerships were developed and funded. BBSRC and NIFA jointly funded 5 US -UK collaborative projects through this call to control the spread of pathogens and minimize health risks and environmental impacts of food production worldwide. There was positive feedback from both communities. BBSRC and NIFA agreed that there is a need to build a stronger and sustainable trans - Atlantic partn ership between funders and researchers that will allow world -leading researchers in both countries to work together to address emerging and re -emerging threats in animal health and food safety while safeguarding food supplies, animal welfare and public health. Subsequently, BBSRC and the UK -Science and Innovation Network (SIN) Houston Team developed a joint bid to secure UK funding to support a small, high -level workshop with government and research representatives from the US and UK. The focus would be to consider next generation vaccines, alternatives to antimicrobials in livestock, and ot her research challenges and areas of shared concern to address the global emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance . NIFA provided USDA co -funding for the workshop and also partnered with the University of Maryland -College Park to support participat ion from the US research community , as well as oversee on -site workshop needs. Through this joint researchers' and funders' workshop, BBSRC and NIFA are initiating the development of a strategic framework for working within Animal Health and Welfare, including Food Safety, Veterinary Vaccinology, and Antimicrobial Resistance. The aim is to develop a longer term US -UK partnership driven by scientific needs and priorities of mutual benefit. We welcome participation in the strategic framework's developmen t from other federal partners whose mission areas complement one or more of the workshop themes. 3.

In summary, NIFA has several programs that support the themes of this workshop and has a history of partnerships with federal agencies . NIFA is growing its' engagement with BBSRC to link science communities and e ager for innovative ways to enhance links around worksh op themes with BBSRC & other federal agencies for mutual benefit . Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (Sadhana Sharma, Strategy and Policy Man ager - Animal Health & Welfare) BBSRC is the UK's leading funder of academic research and training in the non -clinical life sciences. One of 7 UK Research Councils that work together as Research Councils UK, BBSRC is funded by the UK Government Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, with an annual budget of around \u00a3484 million (2013 -2014). BBSRC has a unique and central place in supporting the UK's world -leading position in bioscience, investing in world -class bioscience research and training on behalf of the UK public. Our aim is to further scientific knowledge, to promote economi c growth, wealth and job creation and to improve quality of life in the UK and beyond. BBSRC's Strategic Plan: The Age of Bioscience which was refreshed in 2013 highlights three major strategic science priorities: Agriculture and Food Security; Industria l Biotechnology and Bioenergy, Bioscience for Health and three crucial enabling themes, which are critical to our vision for UK bioscience: Enabling innovation, exploiting new ways of working, partnership. BBSRC operate s flexible funding streams from sma ll, pump -priming or proof of -concept studies through to strategic longer, larger programmes of research. Responsive mode funding, is the main funding mechanism that support excellent research in response to unsolicited ideas from research groups, consortia or individuals in any area relevant to BBSRC's remit. 11 BBSRC's responsive mode highlight number of priorities and those that are relevant to this workshop are: animal health; welfare of managed animals; t he replacement, refinement and reduction (3Rs) in r esearch using animals ; combatting antimicrobial resistance; and sustainably enhancing agricultural production . BBSRC has number of existing international collaboration in animal health and welfare with Brazil, Europe, India, USA (NSF and NIFA) and China. 6. US-UK PARTNERSHIP: SWOT (STRENGT HS, WEAKNESS ES, OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS) ANALYSIS The participants performed a SWOT (STRENGTHS, WEAKNESS ES, OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS) analysis on all four workshop topics . The detailed analysis is at Annex 3 . The group highlighted that US -UK collaboration provide s a unique opportunity to exploit biodiversity , and unique agricultural and management models in both countries to develop agri-system resilience in both countries . The top three opportunities and c hallenges identified by the participants are summarized below: Vaccinology (for animal health and food safety) Opportunities : Building on collaborative global networks (Veterinary Vaccinology Network, G lobal Foot and Mouth disease Research Alliance (GFRA) , Global African Swine Fever Research Alliance (GARA) ) between two countries, a joint US-UK collaboration could address biogenomics and immunogenetics that underpin vaccine research and address the gap in development of immune reagents . Challenges: Participants highlighted developing vaccines to large complex pathogen s and the lack of immune reagents as major challenge s impeding vaccine research . In addition , there is a need to develop better methods for discovery/predicting protective antigen s. Antimicrobial Resistance - Alternatives to Current Antimicrobials & Antiparasitic Opportunities: A joint collaboration between the UK and US, that between them have developed m ost of the world's antibiotics, could address the dynamics of AMR in populations , analyze gene flow , and strengthen research in developing alternative s to current antibiotics . Also, joint training programmes , including informatics , would help address a capacity gap. Challenges : A key challenge is to identify what alternatives should be pursued and influencing behavioural changes (current versus adopted) . Also, differences in regulatory framework s in the US and UK could restrict joint collaboration . Information on alternatives to antibiotics (ATA) that are c urrently in the research pipeline {see USDA ATA Resource Center: http://www.ars.usda.gov/alternativestoantibiotics/ } 12 Emerging & Re -emerging Ani mal Pathogens, including Zoonose s Opportunities: A joint UK -UK collaboration w ould be very beneficial to help address issues of emerging infections by developing disease surveillance system s and getting a global perspective on disease emergence . Collaboration w ould enable better integration of data e.g. genomics, location/movement of animals. Challenges : Two most important drivers for disease emergence are: climate change and global trade . Animal Welfare/ Well -Being Opportunities: A joint collaboration would provide more opportunities in welfare research ; coordinat ing research across countries would reduc e unnecessary duplication and the number of animals in research . Working together , US -UK researchers would broaden a multidisciplinary approach ; strengthen collaborations between animal scientists and veterinarian s; and accelerate the translat ion of basic research into applied research and outcome oriented results available for producer adoption. Challenges: There is decrease d funding for animal welfare in both US and UK. There can be competing interests of funders, producers and consumers that make welfare research challenging. US -UK collaboration s will need to consider differences in regulation/legislation between the two countries . 7. RESEARCH GAPS AND CHALLENGES This session included a series of short presentations from the UK and US delegates to highlight key research challenges, current gaps and unmet needs. Vaccinology (for animal health and food safety) Vaccinology present s an ideal opp ortunity for collaboration as it builds on the UK's and USA's strengths in immunology and genomics and there fore, presents ideal opportunities for collaborative projects to apply novel technologies to vaccine studies for specific diseases . There are some existing US-UK links in development of underpinning technolog ies; expanding joint collaboration with funding would reduce duplication and accelerate progress . There are similar gaps and issues in vaccine research in both countries and a joint collaboration will enable them to be addressed effectively by a ccess ing expertise and funding in both countries . Researchers agreed that collaboration between the US and UK historically has been difficult as little funding has been available from the US for this . Gaps Diseases that have often proved refractory to vaccination - Frequently persistent infections - Antigenically complex pathogens ( e.g. parasites) - Need to understanding immune mechanisms Difficulties in extrapolating from mice and humans: mouse models often do n ot translate to larger species Different requirements for animal and human vaccines ( e.g. adjuvants and vectors) Limitations in immune reagents and genotyping tools 13 Opportunities using high throughput technologies - New sequencing platforms - Decreasing cost Transcriptomic signatures of protective immunity - Technology is not new but has not yet fulfilled its full potential in field of vaccinology . To date, analyses have mostly been done of whole leukocyte populations but b asic data on normal transcript profiles and pathways in farm animals improving rapidly - Opportunity for targeted analyses of defined cell populations following vaccination and challenge (difficult in human studies) High quality bioinformatics is critical for vaccine research Challenges Improving understanding of host pathogen interactions Markers for immune cell types Relationship between immune gene expression/ protein expression/function - indicators of protection against pathogens - impact of long /short term environmental changes on t he virulence of pathogens and the efficacy of vaccines Development of new vaccines , improvement of existing vaccines and vaccine delivery platforms Mechanism of adjuvant action, improving targeting and reducing side effects Use of DNA vaccines and live vaccines , including consideration of regulat ory hurdles Development of oral vaccines based on better understanding of mucosal immunity Development of parasite vaccines Development of vaccine delivery platforms Research areas that would benefit f rom joint US-UK collaboration include o Fundamental understanding of immune systems in livestock species to underpin studies of immune responses : - Cell surface markers to identify cell types and their stages of maturation and activation - Molecular tools (MHC, NK receptors ) to define host immunogenotypes and to dissect cellular immune responses ( e.g. cloned MHC genes, MHC tetramers, transfected cell lines. - Reference reagents for analyses of antigen receptor repertoires (immunoglobulins and T cell receptor) o Working together to make 'applying next generation sequencing and bioinformatics for livestock' efficient and informative - Discovery Platform s: High throughput sequencing to analyse transcript omes, to define antigen receptor repertoires, to determine sequence div ersity of targeted polymorphic genes and to analyse pathogen diversity. - Bioinformatics tools and expertise . o Application of reagents and omics technologies to: - Evaluate immune responses to infectious agents in the target species - Discover potential vaccine antigens - Evaluate efficacy of existing vaccines - \"correlates of immunity \" in the target species 14 - Design new vaccines & reagents for 'strategic interventions 'or 'countermeasures Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) - Alternatives to Current A ntimicrobials & Antiparasitic AMR is a global problem with huge efforts from both the US and UK to tackle this issue. US- UK collaboration s will provide an opportunity for partnership of two of the best research entities in the world , which have developed most of the world's antibiotics. Both countries face similar problem s and goals in this area. Both counties are trying to answer similar unanswered questions , such as: To what extent has clinically significant AMR been driv en by ant ibiotic use in animals? What is the nature, direction & frequency of AMR transfer under selection & during infection ? How rapidly does AMR decay on farm or food when selection is removed i.e. the effect of resistance on biological fitness ? Gaps Group identified There are few drug classes and limited chemical space represented in current antibiotics Few MoA (7) and few distinct chemical classes (11) (poor arsenal) Contemporary drug screening is high throughput, but limited in \"chemical space\" Few drug mechanisms of actions (MoAs) have been exploited so far Recently developed drugs lack new MoAs Challenges Resistance is an enormous challenge New chemical classes and MoA s have proven difficult to exploit Most novel ideas involve development of la rger molecules , where delivery becomes a challenge Pathogen selective anti-bacterial s are difficult to develop and market forces favour broad spectrum drugs Little or no progress with Gram -negative bacteria Alternatives to Antibiotics Alternatives can take advantage of many unexploited essential genes to idemtify potential targets to screen for novel antimicrobials as well as drugs (e.g. there are 19 essential genes for DNA replication alone and only 3 targeted with current drugs ). Alternatives could include Nucleic acid target ing agents (e.g. DNA : bleomycin and RNA : aminoglycosides ) or nucleic acid as drug s (antisense and repressor decoys) Larger molecules that target proteins, such as antibacterial antibodies, Nanoparticles, which could improve delivery or control release , Resentace blocking strategies, which could rejuvenate current anti -bacterials as exemplified by clavulanic acid, 15 Host defen se peptides can be directly microbicidal & immunomodulatory Bacteriophages are licensed & partly effective as topical carcass treatments for foodborne pathogens Phytochemicals with antibacterial activity and/or enhancers of innate immunity Vaccines that could reduce the use antibiotics in animal production Research areas that would benefit from join t US -UK collaboration include Target identification and prioritisation : which microbial genes are most essential for viability and virulence (i.e. most effectively targeted) and do not have close orthologues in the host, in order to exploit as antimicrobial targets? Develop ing better cell based high throughput screening assays Develop ing antimicrobials , including alternatives , that are unlike ly to succumb to resistance Understand ing the role of microbial communities (e.g. to what extent does the indigenous & unculturable microbiota receive & donate AMR elements) and rational manipulation of the microbiota Develop ing pathogen selective antimicrobials Identify ing natural antimicrobial products and develop ing recombinant antimicrobial products Developing g reater understanding of e volutionary biology of microbes Control of diseases that rely on antibiotics by selection and tran sgenesis . Antiparasitic Developing resistance to antiparasitic is an area of major concern that threatens the sustainability of livestock production . In poultry for example, incursion of ectoparasites (mites) into intensive layer industry is causing significant wel fare and economic problems in Europe and N orth America, with very little effort invested into new/alternative methods of control. Lack of subunit/broad spectrum vaccines for coccidia is leaving the broiler industry reliant on a limited arsenal of drugs whi ch poorly control parasite growth leading to suboptimal weight gains, poor welfare (pathological lesions even in the absence of external symptoms), and increasing risk of severe disease outbreaks. No drugs/vaccines at all for many protists including zoon otics such as Cryptosporidium (topical in the UK), toxoplasma. In addition, there are poor financial incentives for big pharma to develop new ant iparasitic s. Gaps: In vitro and HTS assays o Culturing of m ost major veterinary parasites as they cannot be maintained outside of the animal host o Genetic manipulation remains intractable for the majority of parasites Evolutionary biology of parasites (and Hosts) o Microbial genetics and evolution as it is critical in driving resistance to drugs and vaccines o What p arasites are out there? How diverse are they? How common is polyclonal infection? How likely is cross -fertilisation? o Need to combine genomics, genetics, epidemiology and modelling in order to predict longevity of targets in 'real' farm situations Integrated management of agri -systems 16 o Tackling parasitic diseases requires long -term investment (with public -private funding partnerships) and a co -ordinated interdisciplinary approach o Solutions must consider sustainability, economic threats, potential financial returns, farm engineering, human behaviour and m otivation, and societal opinions Research areas that would benefit from joint US -UK collaboration include Generation of complete genome sequences of complex eukaryotic pathogens for which there ar e currently limited sequence data e.g. helminthes, ticks and mites including need for information on the genotypic structure and diversity of parasite populations {limited available information indicates that nematodes isolates are genotypically heterogene ous which has resulted in difficulties in assembling parasite genomes. Also implies frequent genetic crossing} Establishment of genetic markers for resistance to all ant iparasitics Identification of novel drug targets Genetic identification of parasite -resistant breeding stock and understanding of the genetic and mechanistic basis Development of novel non -chemical approaches to decrease use of antiparasitics Working in collaboration to develop b etter high throughput screening assays Developing a ntimicrobials that are unlikely to succumb to resistance Understanding r ole of microbial communities including the effect of the microbiome on susceptibility to parasites or host responses Emerging & Re -emerging Ani mal Pathogens, including Zoonose s The US and UK bring complementary strengths in this area. A joint collaboration w ould increase the critical mass of researchers and enable sharing of reagents and facilities (e.g. high containment for large animals ). Emerging and re -emerging pathogens of chicken (e.g. avian Influenza ) and swine (e.g. porcine epidemic diarrhea virus , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ) were highlighted. A recommended aim is to develop knowledge -based integrated app roaches that result in technological breakthroughs in animal production systems, disease management, detection, prevention and control (of pathogens) . Challenges and Research areas that would benefit from joint US -UK collaboration Understanding and predicting cross -species transmission o Detailed understanding of pathogen biology to identify host and pathogen factors that enable/restrict replication o Ability of virus to adapt to new host Understanding the role of reservoir hosts and pathogen evolution and pathogenesis Studying m ulti-host pathogens at the epidemiological scale Uses of 'omics technologies for forensic epidemiology (in particular whole genome sequencing/phylodynamics, but also touching on transcriptomics) What are the d rivers of emergence (climate change, global trade ) Changing epidemiological paradigms with 'big data' 17 Inadequate funding for emerging animal infectious agents especially those with unknown clinical implications in animals. Need strong international collaborations for emerging animal infectious agent surveillance and research Animal Welfare/ Well -Being Consumers in b oth the US and UK are very keen on wanting to be assured that the welfare of agricultural animals is not compromised in a negative way. A joint US -UK coll aboration in this area w ould benefit from the diversity of animal management systems in both countries . The UK has a strong track record in underpinning research on behaviour, cognition, early experience, and welfare assessment ; new technologies are being incorporated into welfare assessment approaches . Gaps and Challenges: Welfare measures: that welfare / well -being are based on the assumption that animals can suffer and experience negative affective states - welfare measures should reflect these states and should be quick and practical. Animal behaviour: Understanding how animals view the world/others around them and understanding causes of abnormal and damaging behaviour, especially in the social context New metrics of well -being: Cognition and genomics based methods to objectively classify impacts of management practices on well -being Early life challenges: Understanding what types of prenatal and postnatal experience exert beneficial or detrimental effects on later behaviour, coping, productivity and welfare, and how they exert such effects Housing management and environment: m anaging animals in a way that provides for their behavioural wants and needs and systems that work for small and large operators Pain and nociception : Pain assessment is difficult. R ecog nising and managing animal pain and u nderstanding the relevance of pai n for animal welfare and welfare assessment . Lack of analgesic drugs in the USA compared to UK . Stress: Understanding the role of genetic variation in animal welfare / stress responses: Using that vari ation to improve animal welfare. Linking stress to AMR . Transportation: stress caused immunosuppression that lead to e.g. Bovine Respiratory Diseases. Understanding sources of transportation stress and research to optimize preconditioning. Research areas that would benefit from joint US -UK collaboration include Comprehensive, multi -disciplinary approaches - improved links with other disciplines, with veterinary science and with social science New technologies to monitor animals - animal -mounted and environmental sensing platforms Stress biology, especially chronic stress, better tools for assessment Genetics and genomics - data -sharing or linked phenotyped populations Genetic selection for group housing Epidemiological approaches to understanding welfare risks 18 On farm assessment of welfare Ability to identify o utlier animals (highest welfare risks) Standardized assessment tools/criteria? New metrics of well -being Translation and application of discoveries Ethical thinking and social acceptability of use of animals 8.
