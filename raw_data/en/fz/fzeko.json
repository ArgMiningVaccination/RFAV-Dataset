Lord Joffe's Patient(Assisted Dying) Bill 1passed its second reading on 6 June without a vote, and now goes to thecommittee stage, where it can be amended and revised beforereturning for a third reading and final vote probably this autu mn. If it traverses the House of Lords it then faces the much easierchallenge of three readings in the Commons before becoming law. The Bill seeks to legalise euthanasia for any patient with an 'irremediable condition' (defined as 'a terminal or serious phy sical illness') with 'unbearable suffering' (as defined by the patien t) provided that two doctors can confirm that the patient is of so und mind and has made the request voluntarily. If passed it wouldopen the floodgates to euthanasia in this country given the cur rent climate of favourable public opinion, some willing doctors, andmany patients already feeling a burden to relatives, carers andsociety at large. Requests for voluntary euthanasia are rarely free and voluntary , and in fact extremely rare when patients' physical, psychologic al and spiritual needs are properly met. CMF has consistentlyopposed euthanasia on the grounds that it is unnecessary (becau se alternative treatments exist), dangerous (because of the slippe ry slope) and morally wrong (contrary to all historically acceptedcodes of medical ethics and the Judeo-Christian ethic). We can be encouraged from the House of Lords debate that the Bill has drawn together a strong opposing coalition consisting of people who would not normally be on the same side in otherbioethical debates, especially those concerning the beginning o f life: Lord Alton and the All-Party Parliamentary Prolife Group,Archbishop Rowan Williams, Broadcaster Robert Winstone andRichard Harries, Bishop of Oxford. It is noteworthy that a House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics in 1994 opposed any change in the law to alloweuthanasia after an extensive enquiry and concluded that 'it wa s virtually impossible to ensure that all acts of euthanasia were truly voluntary and that any liberalisation of the law in the UnitedKingdom could not be abused.' They 'were also concerned thatvulnerable people - the elderly, lonely, sick or distressed - w ould feel pressure, whether real or imagined, to request early death .' We need to pray that this wisdom continues to prevail. Christian doctors are encouraged to write to individual House o f Lords members, encouraging them to oppose the Bill, at House ofLords, London, SW1A 0PW. A full list of members, along withinstructions on how to address them is available on the interne t. 2 Peter Saunders Managing Editor of Triple Helix 1www.parliament.the-stationery- office.co.uk/pa/ld200203/ldbills/037/2003037.pdf 2www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld/ldinfo/a-z.htmThe Sexual Health Enquiry Good on diagnosis but offers an ineffective prescription On Wednesday 11 June 2003 the much leaked in advance House of Commons Health Committee Reporton Sexual Health 1was published. Having been one of just two GPs who gave oral evidence to the Committee,I was not surprised at its findings. David Hinchliffe the Labour chair of the committee was widely q uoted as saying that sexual health in the UK was 'in crisis' and 'We do not use the word \"crisis\" lightly'. This remark was prompted not only b y the steep rises in STIs (gonorrhoea rates have doubled and syphilis risen by 500% in the past 6 years) but by the breakdown in GUM services to cope with this rise. People were reported as being turned away from clinics and told to come back two weeks later! In terms of diagnosis the report in its shortest section quite correctly highlights changes in sexual behaviour such as increasing numbe rs of both serial and concurrent sexual partners, decreased age of fi rst intercourse, increasing numbers of men ever having had sex with other men, increasing numbers of men paying for sex and increasing fr equency of anal sex for both men and women. The prescription for improving sexual health does not lie in mo difying these behaviours however but in reducing the risk by greater co ndom use and more (and compulsory) sex education in schools. No referenc e at all is made to the increasing evidence of the ineffectiveness of co ndoms to prevent the spread of the most common STIs such as HPV , HSV andchlamydia 2and there is no convincing evidence anywhere in the world that the sort of sex education programmes which this report pro motes achieve either a reduction in teenage pregnancies or in STI rat es. Despite the evidence I presented3along with Robert Whelan, the Director of Family Education T rust on the evidence for the effectiveness ofabstinence education the report states, 'We see no benefit in p reventative approaches based primarily around promoting abstinence'. What they do promote as a model to follow is the Swedish system of care. This is quite bizarre since the report also states that ' our visits to Sweden and the Netherlands also showed us that the public healt h problems caused by sexual ill health are increasing rapidly eve n in countries where such good practice is found'. Quite so. The chl amydia rate in Sweden has risen by 60% in the past four years and rate s of STIs are rising at an alarming rate in the Netherlands. Why is their practice then considered 'good' by the committee? Professing to be wise, this report shows that they are fools. 4Putting potted plants and wicker chairs in the GUM clinic waiting room may be laudable but the government's blind refusal to tackle behaviour al change as a primary prevention priority will mean that sexual health i n the UK will be much worse in ten years time in spite of the committee' s good work in highlighting the severity of the problem that exists ev en now. Trevor Stammers General Practitioner in West London 1 www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmselect/cmhealth/6 9/6902.htm 2 Stammers T. The Condom Controversy. Triple Helix 2002; 20:10,11 (Summer) 3 www.famyouth.org.uk/Inquiry.pdf4 Romans 1:22Editorials Photo: Wellcome Photo LibraryOn T uesday 8 April the Court of Appeal gave the go- ahead for the Hashmi family to have a child by in vitrofertilisation in order to provide a 'life-saving' bonemarrow transplant for their son Zain, who has B-thalassemia major. The ruling overturned a December 2002 HighCourt judgement in favour of 'Comment on Reproductive Ethics'(CORE) and was widely applauded in the press, and in particular by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) and theBritish Medical Association (BMA). More recently on 16 June Britain's first 'designer baby' was bo rn in Sheffield. Michelle and Jayson Whitaker's baby Jamie wasgenetically selected in a Chicago Clinic, whilst still an embry o, to be a near perfectly matched blood stem cell donor for his four- year old brother Charlie who suffers from Diamond-Blackfan Anaemia.The HFEA had earlier opposed the Whittakers having embryoselection in the UK on the grounds that it would not directlybenefit the selected embryo, and stood by its earlier decision, this time unsupported by the BMA. Media and public opinion seemed to be strongly behind the parents in both cases; but there were several things that distu rbed me. First, I was concerned by the way public opinion was manipulated by selective and inaccurate reporting of the medica l facts. The impression given by the media, that both Zain Hashmiand Charlie Whittaker would die soon without the transplants an d that the transplants would be straightforward and uncomplicated , was quite misleading. There is no doubt that both B-thalassemia and Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (DBA) are serious conditions. Before any treatment wasavailable all sufferers died within a year from the inability t o produce red blood cells. T reatment with regular monthly blood transfusi ons (the only treatment still available in most developing countrie s) extends life-span to the early teenage years, but then most pat ients die from the complications of iron deposition. This can beameliorated with chelation treatment using desferrioxamine, giv en five times a week by slow subcutaneous infusion (usually over n ight). This has made possible a median survival of 31 years for DBA an d 40- 50 years for B-thalassemia, and results are improving all the t ime. Bone marrow transplantation from a tissue-matched donor (almost always a sibling or close family member) for both conditions of fers the only chance of a complete cure but there are risks. 5% of patie nts do not survive the procedure, and a further 10% are not cured; and there are also the long-term risks of debilitating 'graft versus host disease' and the side-effects of immuno-suppressant drugs, which includeincreased susceptibility to infection and some forms of cancer. Gene therapy may offer further treatment options in the future but n ot yet. Haematologists themselves remain divided over whethertransfusion/chelation or bone marrow transplant is best in any given case; it is by no means clear-cut.In the Whittaker's case a suitable donor may have already been found (in newborn baby Jamie) although seven embryos of the'wrong' tissue type were discarded in the selection process and one other that was implanted failed to survive. Ironically it is st ill possible (up to 25% chance) that Jamie too may turn out to suffer from D BA and that the Whittakers may be left with two children with thecondition! For the Hashmi's, only about one in five embryosproduced by IVF will be the right HLA tissue type and free of t he disease and in a woman of Mrs Hashmi's age the chance of anyimplanted embryo surviving is around 10% per cycle (with each c ycle costing around \u00a32,500). So, in other words, we can expect aroun d 50 embryos, all human lives in their own right, to be discarded or lost for each one that survives. And even then there are difficulties wi th pre- natal screening. Zain himself initially tested normal, and an e arlier sibling who was thought to be a good match turned out not to be . Another sibling was aborted when found to have Zain's condition . The rush to conceive a sibling is not because Zain is about to die, but because his mother's biological clock is ticking such that an I VF child will not long be an option. Second, it is often said that 'hard cases make bad law' and the Hashmi ruling has, I believe, created a very dangerous preceden t. Many of us already have severe misgivings about pre-implantatio n diagnosis, a procedure already legal in this country, whereby h uman embryos having various disabilities are searched out and destro yed. This seems to strike at the very heart of Christian morality, w hich decrees that the strong have a duty to protect and respect the weak. It also runs counter to the Declaration of Geneva (1948), whichcalls doctors to 'maintain the utmost respect for human life fr om the time of conception even against threat'. After all, what hu man life is more vulnerable and defenceless than an embryo with spe cial needs? But the Hashmi ruling goes a step further because it hasopened the door for human beings to be manufactured for theprime purpose of providing tissue for someone else. It isparticularly disturbing that a case where the proposed treatmen t involves significant mortality (not just for the discarded embr yos but also possibly for the sick child) and where the chances ofsuccess are so low should have been used to legitimise the high ly controversial practice of embryo selection for tissue type. The Court of Appeal, HFEA and BMA have taken a quantum leap down the slippery slope to 'designer' babies, whereby humanembryos can be created and discarded for increasingly trivial r easons. The Hashmi decision was made in haste in an emotionally chargedatmosphere where a proper objective consideration of the facts of the case and consequences of the judgement was well-nigh impossible . I am convinced that we will come to regret it.

Designer babies Photo: PAThe Hashmi family DesignerResearch Homeopathy is one of the most popular and controversial of theplethora of alternative therapiesavailable within and without the NHS. The word homeopathy is derived from twoGreek words, homoios meaning 'like' and patheia meaning 'pain or suffering'. Homeopathyepitomises strong paradox inherent in thepresent attitude towards so-called integrativemedicine. On one hand, there is a desire to pursueclinical excellence, properly dependent uponevidence-based medicine; on the other, there is asomewhat illogical desire to embrace alternativetherapies dependent on unscientific philosophiessuch as ch'i, life force and universal cosmic energy. Origins No clear ancient origins exist, although both Hippocrates (c460-370 BC) and Paracelsus (1493-1542 AD) considered that healing might befacilitated by medicines that produce symptomssimilar to those of the disease. They didn't considerusing extreme dilutions, a process of shaking orpotentisation and neither followed their thinkingthrough into practical medicines. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843) was the founder of homeopathy. He was born in Meissen, Saxonyand studied medicine and chemistry at theuniversities of Leipzig, Vienna and Erlangen. Hegraduated with a degree in medicine in 1779 andbegan to practice in a variety of posts but continuedhis research into chemistry. He soon becamedisillusioned with the ineffective, painful andsometimes fatal treatments of his day that includedbloodletting, leaches, purging and medicinescontaining dangerous chemicals such as arsenic andmercury. He gave up his practice and turned to research and translation. After translating a treatise onMateria Medica by William Cullen, an Edinburgh physician, he became interested in Peruviancinchona bark as a treatment for malaria. 1Having tested it on himself, he believed that small dosesproduced symptoms similar to those of malaria.After testing other substances, a process called provings, he concluded that they could be used totreat diseases with similar symptoms. Heformulated his first principle (sometimes known as'law') of homeopathy: similar similibus curantor meaning 'let like be cured by like'. Hahnemann returned to medical practice and put his newfound theory into practice but with limitedsuccess. Concerned about side effects calledaggravations, he decided to dilute his originalmedicines or mother tinctures. One drop wasdiluted with nine or ninety nine drops of solvent(water and alcohol) making a dilution of one in ten(lx) or one in a hundred (lc) respectively. Thisprocess was repeated six, twelve or 30 times, eg 6c,12c or 30c. This process of dilution is the secondprinciple of homeopathy. Still dissatisfied with clinical results, Hahnemann decided to shake the solutions between eachdilution, a process he called succussion, which hebelieved potentised the resulting remedy withsome form of vital force. Potentisation is the thirdprinciple of homeopathy. In 1810 he set out his findings in the Organon of Rational Medicine, later to be called the Organon of the Rational Art of Healing . 2He later published a six volume Homeopathic Materia Medica .3Despite widespread opposition, he continued to teach andpractise his new system of medicine, based on thesethree essential principles, in his native Germanyand later in Paris where he died in 1843. Althoughhis views were generally unpopular with themedical establishment, a few doctors did accept hisprinciples and there was a gradual worldwidespread, which we continue to witness today. It isrecorded that Hahnemann was born into a Christianfamily but became a very active Freemason andlater followed the teachings of Confucius. 4 Homeopathy in Britain Dr Frederick Quinn studied under Hahnemann and believed that he had been healed of cholera bya homeopathic preparation of camphor. He went onto introduce homeopathy into England in 1826, SUMMER 03 IITRIPLE HELIX 5HomeopathyGeorge Smith continues his series with a look at this widely usedalternative medicine KEY POINTS Homeopathy was first developed by Samuel Hahnemann in the early19th century and is based onthe principle that extremelydiluted and shaken solutionsof substances that producesimilar symptoms to a givendisease, have curativeproperties. Althoughrelatively safe (apart from itsuse possibly delayingeffective orthodoxtreatment) it has no rationalscientific basis and extensivereviews have shown noconclusive or consistentevidence of efficacy.Furthermore there are practitioners haveoccult associations.Homeopathy cannot berecommended on the basisthat it appears to be neitherbiblically sound nor evidence based.setting up a practice in London and establishing the British Homeopathic Society in 1832. The LondonHomeopathic Hospital was founded in 1850 andthere are now similar hospitals in Bristol, Glasgow,Liverpool and T unbridge Wells. Established in1978, the Society of Homeopaths grants registration(RSHom) and fellowships (FSHom); medicallyqualified practitioners may become members of theFaculty of Homeopathy (MFHom). 5 T oday, homeopathy is the third most popular therapy (after osteopathy and chiropractic) in theUnited Kingdom. Queen Adelaide (wife of WilliamIV), who came from Saxony and was acontemporary of Hahnemann, started the RoyalFamily's custom of using homeopathic medicinesand recent monarchs have regularly appointed ahomeopathic physician. Prince Charles, a strongsupporter of many forms of alternative medicine,advocates homeopathy for both humans andanimals. Homeopathic diagnosis includes a full medical history, examination and special investigationsalthough these are necessarily restricted in thosewithout a medical qualification. Homeopaths assessappearance, constitution and personality and arriveat a symptom picture. When homeopathy ispresented in New Age settings such as Mind, Body,Spirit Festivals or Psychic Fayres, diagnosis mayinclude divination, astrology and pendulumswinging. In the United most medicallyqualified homeopaths would distance themselvesfrom such practices. Homeopathic treatment today still depends on Hahnemann's three original principles. Havingassessed the symptom picture, treatment is based onmatching this with a remedy picture selected from ahomeopathic pharmacopoeia . 6The remedy may be given perhaps for six doses; if not effective, a furtherselection is made. If a 6c dilution does not work, a30c strength may then be selected. 6x is the usualstrength for over-the-counter preparations but 6cand 30c would be common starting strengths fortrained homeopaths. It is presumed that the moreextreme the dilution, the greater its efficacy. It is commonly believed that homeopathic remedies are based only on herbs, plants and othernatural substances assuming that 'natural meansharmless'. However, many of the substances in themother tincture are noxious and poisonous includinganthrax poison from the spleen of an infected sheep,rattlesnake and cobra venom, discharge from ascabies blister, sulphuric acid and arsenic. But no harm results because of the extreme dilution. Medical Checklist 1. Does it have a rational, scientific basis? The idea that 'like may cure like' is quite contrary to orthodox medical principles. Symptomsare usually treated and respond to medicines withthe opposite effect: diarrhoea responds toconstipating medicines such as codeine rather thanbowel irritants such as castor oil. This is termedallopathy , the opposite principle to homeopathy. Within therapeutic limits, conventionalpharmacology dictates that a higher drugconcentration gives a more powerful effect.Homeopathy turns this on its head: the extremedilutions involved mean that, from the dilutions of12c onwards, not one molecule of substance ispresent in the homeopathic preparation, be itliquid, powder or tablets. Homeopaths do notdispute this but believe that some form of imagingor ultra molecular action takes place in the solventduring the process of potentisation. Evidence forthis is not forthcoming. The recent chance findingthat molecules in solution cluster together as thesolution is diluted was thought to have a possiblerelevance to the preparation of homeopathicremedies but this has not been progressed to ascientific conclusion. 7,8Homeopathy is not scientifically comparable with vaccination,immunisation or allergic desensitisation.Homeopaths maintain that the process ofpotentisation produces a healing power in theremedy called a vital force. This term clearlyequates to the ch'i of Chinese acupuncture, the prana of Ayurvedic medicine and the universal cosmic energy associated with New Age advocatesof alternative therapies. 2. Does it work? It is generally accepted that anecdotal observations are insufficient to demonstrate thevalidity of any therapy, be it orthodox or alternative.A considerable number of scientific investigationsinto homeopathy have been attempted. Resultshave been correlated, (particularly by meta-analysis)and subjected to clinical, scientific and statisticalscrutiny in the Department of ComplementaryMedicine at Exeter University, directed by 6 TRIPLE HELIX IISUMMER 03Research IBopp H.

London: Guild, 1989 IPfeifer S. Healing at Any Price? Milton Keynes: Word, 1980 Kindersley, 1995BibliographyCan we, with integrity, prescribe a medicine that does not contain one molecule of effective remedy?Research Professor Edzard Ernst. Almost 50 reports have been published in their journal FACT over the past six years.9Methodology has been of varying standards but after excluding results due to non-specific placebo effects no consistent or conclusiveevidence of efficacy emerges. A paper published inthe European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology set out to evaluate the clinical efficacy of homeopathy. Itemphasised the difficulties encountered becausethere was no consensus as to the treatment inparticular situations. Furthermore, it noted that themore rigorous the trial, the less likely it was toproduce possible evidence in support of thehomeopathic preparation. The authorsrecommended that more research be carried out butstated, 'There is simply not enough evidence toconclude that homeopathy is clinically effective'. 10 It is generally agreed that the placebo effect is of real importance in general medical care, in the useof alternative therapies and in scientific assessmentof all medical treatments undergoing clinical trials.Professor Ernst discusses this in depth in his book,Complementary Medicine - An ObjectiveAppraisal. 11Of course, with its present popularity and wide royal and celebrity patronage, a significantdegree of placebo effect is to be anticipated fromhomeopathy. Patients may well feel better butwhether any pathological process has beenimproved or cured is very much in doubt. 3. Is it safe? Homeopathy is often considered to be safe for minor and self-limiting complaints. There are noreasonable grounds for advocating its use instead oforthodox immunisation in children. Generally, it isnot considered appropriate for serious or lifethreatening illness. A valid criticism of homeopathyis that it can encourage serious delay before seekingproven conventional treatment. Dr Andrew Lockie'spopular textbook, A Family Guide to Homeopathy , is subtitled 'A Safe Form of Medicine for the Future'.So it is somewhat disconcerting to read advice thatsuspected ectopic pregnancy may be treatedhomeopathically for two hours before seekingorthodox treatment! 12Similarly, twelve hours' homeopathic treatment for suspected deep is considered acceptable beforeconsidering orthodox treatment. 13These potentially life-threatening conditions should receive proventreatments as soon as they are diagnosed. T orecommend otherwise is not safe medicine! Christian Checklist There are significant areas of concern. Can we, with integrity, prescribe a medicine that does notcontain one molecule of effective remedy? Is itgood practice to prescribe remedies that have beeninvestigated without producing any consistentevidence of efficacy? Is it responsible to delay orwithhold orthodox proven medical treatment whilstrelying on an unproven alternative remedy? Is itacceptable to use a therapy that relies on theprinciple of vital force, clearly comparable with theCh'i (yin and yang) of Eastern religions and the cosmic energy of New Age philosophies? Should weuse a therapy that some practitioners mix withdivination, astrology and pendulum swinging, whichare clearly forbidden in the Bible? 14 Miranda Castro FSHom states: 'Homeopaths believe that there is a balancing mechanism thatkeeps us in health, provided that the stresses on ourconstitution are neither too prolonged or too great.This balancing mechanism Hahnemann called\"vital force\" and he believed it to be \"thatenergetic substance, independent of physical andchemical forces that literally gives us life and isabsent at our death\"' 15 Summary It is appreciated that there are committed and zealous Christians - including past and presentdoctors, nurses and missionaries - who have foundhomeopathy acceptable and useful in their ministry.In today's climate of integrative medicine, it isparticularly relevant for Christian doctors andnurses to decide whether or not they findhomeopathy acceptable. Scientific evidence,biblical guidance and discernment from the HolySpirit all play a part in making this decision. Having said this and taking into account everything discussed in this article, it is my ownconviction that homeopathy clearly falls far short ofbeing a therapy that can be acceptable to use orrecommend. Prove all things, hold fast to that which is good, abstain from all appearance of evil.

The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is one of the world's most controversial internationalorganisations. Serious allegations have been madeby donor nations and human rights groups:complicity in coercive population control, secretabortion promotion, financial and programmemismanagement. The USA and Spain havewithdrawn their funding and there is disagreementin Europe over the agency's future role. The International Organizations Research Group investigated UNFPA's activities. 2Their findings were presented to the European and BritishParliaments this January and are summarised here. Coercive population control UNFPA was set up in 1969 to slow population growth. It is the largest international sponsor ofpopulation programmes. 3Some of these are invaluable: antenatal and postnatal care, efforts toreduce maternal morbidity and mortality, andprovision of gynaecological services. 4Other projects are causing worldwide concern. By funding andassisting in coercive population control, UNFPA hasbeen complicit in human rights violations. China In 1979 UNFPA gave China a grant of $50 million and assisted in the implementation of theOne Child Policy. A demographic institute collecteddata, conducted research and disseminatedinformation on population and family planning. 5So, the Chinese State Family Planning Commissionwere able to tell where women were evading family planning regulations and so set regionalcontraceptive and abortive quotas. In 1985, the USAgency for International Development (USAID)stated, 'The kind and quality of assistance providedby UNFPA contributed significantly to China'sability to manage and implement a populationprogram in which coercion was pervasive'. 6 UNFPA is still active in 32 Chinese counties on the understanding that quotas and birth restrictionshave ceased. 7In October 2001, a human rights group alleged continuing coercion. They describedsecret interviews by the US-based PopulationResearch Institute (PRI) with women in Sihuicounty. The women testified to forced abortionsand sterilisations, arrests and detention. Onewoman, pregnant with her second child, told PRIthat officials 'wanted me to report to the hospitalfor an abortion but I refused to go. I went intohiding in my mother's village. They arrested sixpeople in my mother-in-law's family and destroyedthree homes'. 8 UNFPA's own investigators didn't find any evidence of coercion. Still, none of the team metwith women without the knowledge or presence ofChinese officials; there weren't any private,unmonitored or confidential meetings. In May 2002the United States government sent its owninvestigative team. They found that UNFPA worksin one county where women with more than onechild must pay a 'social compensation fee', up tothree years' income. Based on these findings, theBush administration ended all UNFPA support.Secretary of State, Colin Powell, wrote, 'UNFPA'ssupport of, and involvement in, China's population-planning activities allows the Chinese governmentto implement more effectively its program of 8 TRIPLE HELIX IISUMMER 03UNFPA KEY POINTS The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has done somegood work control, secretabortion promotion, tothe Spainwithdrawing Thisarticle documents specificabuses in programmes inChina, Vietnam and Peruand gives examples ofbotched projects andmisuse of funds. In the faceof this it has to be askedwhy the EU and UK arestill providing funding tothis international agency.Clare Cooper looks at an agency in crisis The United Nations Population Fund The United Nations Population Fund UNFPA coercive abortion'.9He also criticised their supplying of computers andmedical equipment to family planningoffices engaged in coercive practices. Vietnam Vietnam's population programme calls for coercive measures in a thirdpregnancy: a 'two child policy'. Parentsmay have to pay health and educationcosts of a third child, land may beconfiscated and Communist partymembers are expelled. 10A 1989 report stated that women had been forced intoabortions and IUCD use. 11By 2001 Vietnam had one of the world's highestabortion rates. 12According to a UN document, 'Vietnam is undergoing thedemographic transition which is usuallynecessary for a sustainable reduction ofpoverty. Although government policybears the main responsibility for thisachievement, UNFPA's assistance inpreparing for and supporting the policyreform provided necessary capacity andsupport for implementing it'. 13UNFPA gives financial and public relationssupport for this programme. Peru In 1995 Peru embarked on a massive sterilisation programme but reports ofhuman rights abuses quickly arose. 14 USAID voiced concerns over coercivepractices - promises of food for sterilisedwomen and bonuses for health workerswho brought women for sterilisation -and withdrew its family planningfunding in Peru. 15,16UNFPA neither publicly acknowledged coercivepractice nor stopped funding. In June2002 a Peruvian congressionalcommission noted that 90 percent of the200,000 sterilised women had beenpressured or tricked. 'UNFPA, knownfor its support of population control indeveloping countries, took charge. Forthat end, UNFPA acted as T echnicalSecretary.' 17 Abortion UNFPA's policy is not to provide assistance for abortions or abortionservices. 18Yet it conducts abortion research and advises abortion providerson specific procedures. 19Their refugee camp 'emergency be distributed in sub-kits called 'pregnancy termination kits'.21 Programme mismanagement In 1999 the UN Board of Auditors uncovered evidence of programmemismanagement. UNFPA havepurchased contraceptives withoutchecking quality, delivery or supply. 22 In 2002 T anzania rejected an $800,000shipment of ten million faulty condomsafter they failed T anzanianpermeability tests. 23 Financial mismanagement UNFPA couldn't account for 50 percent of money given to nations andnon-governmental organisations in 1998-99. 24This amounts to tens of millions of dollars that could have been usedeffectively.

It wouldbe an improvement if money weregiven for specific projects; better still,funding could be switched toalternative development programmes.The USA transferred its funding toUSAID; they concluded that goodeconomic policies reduce poverty betterthan family planning programmes. 30 Christians know a Father who gently leads those with young and this shouldbe reflected in healthcare planning. Inview of UNFPA's failure to care forpeople as individuals or speak out forjustice, a new international medicalagency should be established to providecare for parents and their children,treating them with respect and dignity.

New York: UNFPA, 2001, 7 May:9 27 Photo LibraryT here's little doubt that Western culture is starving to death. In tenyears of professional pro-lifeeducation, I have observed large numbers of young people who think the elderly havea duty to die, elderly people who think the prebornare a threat to global health, and healthy people whothink the sick and disabled would be better off dead. The trouble with our culture seems to be a spiritual ignorance about who we are and what human beingsare meant for. People are not able to understand themeaning of suffering if they do not sense that they aremade in the image and likeness of a God who createdthem to share in his life-giving and love-giving legacy.Instead of viewing suffering as a profound opportunityto share more fully in the mystery of self-gift, theyperceive it as debilitating, embarrassing, humiliating,undignified and useless. In turn, they resent a Godwho allows it and convince themselves thatcompassion means avoidance of suffering at all costs.That's precisely what abortion, euthanasia, cloning,and destructive stem cell research seek to do. Healingwill only come through a conversion of the heartconcerning what we, as a culture, are living for. In his groundbreaking book, Healing the Culture, A Commonsense Philosophy of Happiness, Freedom, andthe Life Issues , Robert J. Spitzer, President of Gonzaga University, offers a guide to effective pro-life education by looking to the four basic desireswithin the human soul which motivate what we doand how we live. 1 The first human desire is for physical pleasure . It can be immediately satisfied, uses very little of our humanpowers to fulfill, and is necessary for existence. Whilethere is nothing wrong with physical pleasure in itself,a person who makes it his raison d'etre will soon become unsatisfied. He will sense that he is radicallyunder-living his life. This is the soul's way of indicating that there are deeper powers to the humannature yet unfulfilled. The desire for 'something more' is the catalyst for awakening our second human desire: ego-drive or the desire to create a self-identity through comparison,competition, success, popularity, recognition, powerand control. While there's nothing wrong objectivelywith it, pursuing ego-gratification as one's final endwill make life fraught with jealousy, anxiety, suspicion,fear, aggression, obsessive compulsions, contempt forothers and even self-hatred. Many philosophers point out that the solution to this crisis is to look beyond the self to the needs ofothers. This third desire - to contribute and enter into communion with one another - can lead to some of 10 TRIPLE HELIX IISUMMER 03Ethics Camille De Blasi looks at the reasons for the Western world's cultural demise Camille De Blasi looks at the reasons for the Western world's cultural demise CULTURE The good news is that Western culture is not terminally ill. It is just critically sick.How to heal the Keeping I couldn't do without 'to do' lists. Recently, I read an interesting list for growing older!Written by a Harvard medical schoolprofessor, ' Aging Well - Surprising Guideposts to a Happier Life ' suggests the following: don't smoke adopt an adaptive coping style avoid alcohol abusemaintain a healthy weightkeep stability in marriagelook out for the younger generationexercise regularly complete an education 1CULTUREHow to heal the the greatest moments of common cause. It can also lead to some of the darkest moments of despair as wequickly become idealists. The trouble is that we begin to seek fulfillment not in mere love but in perfect, absolute, infinite andunconditional Love. If a person tries to fulfill thisdesire with imperfect, finite human beings, he willexperience inevitable frustration and dashedexpectations. On the other hand, if he responds to thisdesire by entertaining a faith that goes beyond what he can see, then this fourth desire for ultimacy has thepotential to lead him to God and the joy that resultsfrom entering into relationship with absolute andunconditional Love. These four levels of happiness - physical, ego, contribution and faith - offer us a key to the crisis ofmodern man. The culprit seems to be an identity thatignores the ultimate yearnings of the human soul -indeed, ignores the very existence of the soul - andfocuses instead on trying to fulfill a spiritual self withmaterial goods and ego-gratification. This attitude canhave devastating effects. Consider a person who has spent a lifetime defining happiness in terms of physical pleasure and ego-gratification. Success is defined as independence, control, and avoiding pain and loss; he viewsdisabilities with contempt. Quality of life is judged by the ratio of what he has to what he does not have; hemay view euthanasia for the terminally ill as liberating.Love is equated with lust, admiration, and domination over the other; sex is seen as the satisfaction of hisanimal appetite. Suffering is only useful if it can be controlled, and completely useless if it cannot;consequently he may view abortion in Third Worldcountries as compassionate. Ethics entails a calculation of harms and benefits; research on frozen embryosseems like a good ending to a sad story. Freedom means escape from externally imposed obligations andcommitments; he sees rules against cloning asthwarting scientific advancement. T o this person, rights and personhood have become a Peter Singer-likedescription of functions and abilities; he may even call into question partially born and newborn infants.From his perspective, abortion and euthanasia appearto be good answers to human suffering. We cannotchange his answers unless we change his viewpoint. So, let us consider God's point of view. T rue success doesn't come from the things of this world but frombelief in Christ. 2The quality of our lives is not based on what we have but on the fact that God wants us forhimself. 3Love is not about sensation and control but involves compassion and self-sacrifice.4Suffering teaches us to be gentle and humble of heart.5Ethics is not cold calculation but is about being true, noble,pure, lovely and admirable. 6Freedom should be used to serve one another in love.7Personhood and rights belong to each one of us from the moment we arecreated in the womb. 8 If we want a culture that respects the dignity of all human life, we need to awaken the desire for higherideals in the individuals that constitute that culture.This can be accomplished in small ways such asspeaking with family members, friends andcolleagues, leading them to consider deeper levels ofhuman purpose. 9It can be done in bigger ways such as establishing a corps of hospital volunteers who aretrained to help patients find deeper meaning in theirsuffering. 10It can also be accomplished in more formal ways: through retreats, lectures, articles, mediainterviews, public discussions, or classroom activities. 11 The good news is that Western culture is not terminally ill. It is just critically sick. But it needsdesperately to be fed a vision of hope, dignity, love,compassion and faith. There is much to beoptimistic about. The human spirit that floundersunder the weight of ignorance is also the humanspirit that will soar to untold heights when liberatedby a vision of its own dignity. Camille E.

Human desirescan be thought of asoperating at four levels;physical pleasure, ego-drive, contribution toothers and faith. If life issimply seen to be aboutmaximising physicalpleasure and gratifyingthe ego then success,quality of life, sufferingand freedom will beviewed within theseparameters. But seenthrough the eyes of faiththey take on completelydifferent meanings.

London: Little, Brown & Co, 2002ReferencesMost Christian doctors have reached a personal opinion on when lifestarts and are unwilling toprescribe a drug or device that acts at or after that point. It's also an importantissue for many couples when deciding on acontraceptive. It's important that we are armed withthe facts. When do you consider life to start? Is it at fertilisation? Does it start later: before, during oreven after implantation? This debate is ongoing inCMF and will not be considered here. MostChristian doctors have a personal opinion; thoughthis varies, they are united in being unwilling toprescribe a contraceptive drug or device that acts ator after that point. It's also an important issue formany couples when deciding on their own method.We need to be armed with the facts. Yet, partlybecause non-Christian colleagues often do not shareour concerns, accurate scientific information can behard to obtain. T wo research review articles are worth considering. 1,2The take-home message is that human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) is firstmeasurable in the maternal circulation shortly after the time of implantation . 3Hence, research showing no hCG or other known embryo-specific substances inthe maternal blood during contraceptive use, onlytells us that it does not operate after implantation.At least on some occasions, it might operate afterfertilisation, by prevention of implantation or directdestruction of the blastocyst. Clearly, any methodlinked with the presence of serum hCG would beoff-limits to someone requiring a contraceptive thatonly operated before fertilisation. Intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUCDs) The following table summarises the interesting results of a study.4 On this evidence, both copper and inert devices sometimes operate well after fertilisation. Thefindings regarding the Levonorgestrel-intrauterine system (levonorgestrel-IUS) are compatible fertilisation, either through the levonorgestrel effecton cervico-uterine mucus blocking sperm migration oranovulation in a proportion of cycles. Yet unfavourablecervical mucus is not always observed and we knowthat ovulation still occurs in most cycles. 5Is the levonorgestrel effect on sperm migration within theuterine fluid always enough to stop the spermreaching any egg in the tubes? Although there are nodirect data, the very rare cases of ectopic pregnancy inwomen using this method provide indirect evidencethat fertilisation can occur. Several studies have demonstrated that hCG is not the earliest signal of pregnancy. Although not testablein clinical laboratories, Early Pregnancy Factor (EPF)is part of the materno-embryonic immunomodulatoryinteraction. It appears two to six days earlier than hCGand can occur two to seven days after ovulation inwomen who have conceived. 6In fact, EPF is 12 TRIPLE HELIX IISUMMER 03clinical practice Family planning professor John Guillebaud brings an update on the options available forcontraception and the scientific facts on howand when they actually do their work KEY POINTS T he status of the human embryo remains controversial within CMF , buta significant number ofChristian doctors believe thathuman shownthe utmost respect from thetime of fertilisation and soare unwilling to prescribe orrecommend 'contraceptives'that may act after this event.Because most non-Christiancolleagues do not sharethese concerns, and becausethere is no reliablebiochemical marker forfertilisation as opposed toimplantation, the facts onwhich to base suchprescribing decisions can bedifficult to obtain.

Family planning professor John Guillebaud brings an update on the options available forcontraception and the scientific facts on howand when they actually do their workCLinical practice detectable in maternal serum in some cases within 24- 48 hours of fertilisation.7However, the vast majority of research using EPF has been for detecting very earlypregnancy in subfertile women, not for aiding ourunderstanding of the exact modes of action of variouscontraceptives. More research is needed in this area.So, as there is no routinely testable biological markerof the time between fertilisation and implantation, wemust remain unsure that the Levonorgestrel-IUS absolutely never operates post-fertilisation. Systemically applied hormonal methods With the notable exception of Cerazette , the progestogen-only pill (POP) sometimes acts post-fertilisation. 8It permits ovulation in many cycles. Reduced sperm-penetrability of cervico-uterinemucus is unlikely to explain all the failures toconceive in the presence of ovulation. As with IUCDs,the occurrence of ectopic pregnancies provides furtherevidence, though not proof, of this. However, the conscientiously taken low dose combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), Cerazette (a particular POP), the Depo-Provera injection and implant Implanon are all such effective anovulants (preventing ovulation and therefore fertilisation) thatit is scientifically justifiable to conclude that theyoperate prior to fertilisation. The fact that they are capable of blocking implantation does not mean that they ever haveto use this back-up mechanism. Obviously a forgetful COCP user, particularly if taking Loestrin 20, Mercilon or Femodette (the lowest dose UK products), might run the risk of ovulation. Itis the lengthening of the pill-free interval that causespill-failure pregnancies and 'near-misses'. Withoutlengthening of the pill-free time beyond seven daysthrough non-compliance, fertile ovulation is very rare. 9 Even if ovulation did occur without subsequentpregnancy, it does not follow that the COCP actedpost-fertilisation: the sperm may have been blockedby COCP's well-known effect on the mucus. Mostexperts believe that if sufficient pills were missed tocause the mucus mechanism to fail as well, there stillwouldn't be any interference beyond fertilisation; theanti-implantation effect (being the COCP's weakestcontraceptive effect) would fail also, leading toconception. Of course, one couldn't be certain of thisover many years of forgetful pill-taking. Still, we aretalking about a forgetful pill-taker taking one of the weakest available pills. If a couple hold the view that blocking implantation is a form of abortion and are worried about their ownpill-taking compliance, one could recommend thatthey shorten their pill-free intervals and/or use thetricycle regimen (see below). Depo-Provera (D-P) is a brilliantly effective anovulant if injected accurately every 12 weeks. Forsomeone with concerns regarding its modes of action,there is the option of having the injection every tenweeks. This gives added confidence that ovulation isalways blocked with the unacceptable back-upmechanism never being utilised. Summary Assuming perfect compliance, I feel one could be confident that, even after say 20 years' perfect use ofthe COCP , Cerazette, Implanon or Depo-Provera , there would not have been a single occasion when a post-fertilisation mechanism would have been utilised.Moreover, having done everything possible in the light of thebest available scientific data, might not a believer legitimate ly ask her omnipotent Lord to ensure that this would be so forher? After prayerful consideration, my own personal view is that implantation is the biological event thatseparates family planning from abortion. 10Still, I conclude by listing methods that are entirely securefor those who hold the absolutist ethical position thatblocking implantation is a form of abortion. IMale and female sterilisation. IThe combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) , provided the pill-free interval (PFI) is neverlengthened. For added security, the PFI could beshortened to 4 days on a regular basis; or there isthe option of a tricycle regimen. - in which thePFI is eliminated usually for four, three orsometimes (for better bleeding control) twomonophasic pill cycles and then also shortened after each run of packets. 11 ICerazette is a new continuously-taken POP that is as effective as the COCP at blocking ovulationplus blocks sperm by the mucus effect. Moreover,it is taken 365 days a year and so does not havethe COCP's weakness of regular 7-day breaksfrom its actions. IImplanon is a subdermal implant whose hormone content and actions are very similar to Cerazette . It should be replaced no later than the licensed threeyears. IDepo-Provera is another anovulant method. If the 12 week injection interval is never exceeded, it isnot thought that Depo-Provera would ever use a post-fertilisation mechanism. Someone wantingeven greater confidence on that point could beoffered injections every 10 weeks. IFull breast-feeding combined with the POP or Depo-Provera . With the old-type POP , there would only be a slight risk of breakthrough ovulation(and hence the back-up anti-implantationmechanism being used) during weaning. As soonas the baby was not obtaining 100 percent of itsnutrition from breast-feeding, the woman shouldchange to Cerazette or use additional barrier contraception effectively.

Or perhapsProverbs 23 :29-35 for the experience of thebloodshot, bruised, swaying and hallucinatingalcoholic. Depression is commonly diagnosed ingeneral practice and up to half of us may sufferdepression at some time in our lives. Might there besomething in God's Word to describe depression? Ibelieve psalms 42 and 43 give us a good insight. All of us will come across depression at some time, whether in ourselves or others. These psalms suggestthat it is a common part of the human experience andgive us a clear view of how it feels to be depressed.The psalmist describes his mood as 'downcast' and 'disturbed' three times. He says, 'tears have been myfood,' suggesting a chronicity to his condition, and perhaps loss of appetite. His depression has physicalsensation, 'My bones have suffered mortal agony' withperhaps an indication of morbidly expecting his owndeath. Depressed people often have feelings of grief and mourning either as a cause or effect of depression, 'Why must I go about mourning' occurring in bothpsalms 42 and 43. He has feelings of chaos,represented by the deeps in the waterfall, and ofbeing overwhelmed: 'all your waves and breakers haveswept over me.' Many depressed people do seem tostruggle with organising their thoughts and feel out ofcontrol. Planning in depressed people may become difficult: 'When can I go and meet with God?'Paranoia-like feelings may occur in depression and are described in 43:1. Since there is such a detailed description of depression in God's Word, we can reassuredepressed Christians that God understands thedepressive condition. Some depressed peoplereport feeling guilty that they do not feel happier,considering all of God's gifts to them. These psalms give us 'permission' to be depressed . The cause for the psalmist's depression is not clear. The cause may be spiritual ; a felt separation from God. One of the striking features of these twopsalms is this feeling. From the beautiful and well-known opening verses of Psalm 42 describingthirsting for God, he asks rhetorically, 'where can Igo and meet with God?' and poignantly, 'why haveyou forgotten me?' This separation is felt rather thanreal as Romans 8:39 reassures us that 'neither heightnor depth nor anything else in all creation will beable to separate us from the love of God that is inChrist Jesus our Lord.' His sense of separation fromGod may be either a cause or a consequence of hisdepression. Certainly no Christian can be content orcomplete without fellowship with God. Perhaps it is his circumstances that are causing his depression. He is separated from his fellows and maybe lonely living in Jordan away from his Jerusalemhome. Perhaps he has withdrawn from his friends as aresult of his depression. Persecution undermines thetoughest man (Ps 42: 3), and the depressed Christianmaybe more susceptible to mocking, 'Where is yourGod?' Physical symptoms can be a cause or at least a precipitation for depression. It might, however, beargued that the psalmist rejects any of these as thecause of his depression as he repeatedly asks why heis depressed. The Christian depressive and hisattendants may find it difficult to separate cause andeffect; spiritual, physical or emotional. Since theanswer eloquently stated in these psalms is to turn toGod, this may not matter very much anyway. Some of the distortion and slowing of mental processing which may occur in depression can prevent the depressed Christian from praying toGod for himself. The practical effects of this meansthat his Christian friends may need to do the praying for him. The very fact of the depressed person'sinability to pray can add to his feelings of guilt.Since he may already have low self-esteem and low 14 TRIPLE HELIX IISUMMER 03psychiatry depressionBEATING Timely advice from the Psalms KEY POINTS P salms 42 and 43 give a good description of the clinicalfeatures of depression andprovide assurance thatdepression is both part planning andparanoia.

These two psalms then give us one wayto pray for, and counsel, the depressed Christian.We can point out that the depressed person shouldtry to put their hope in God , for he sends forth his light and truth, which will guide our depressedbrother. We can reassure our brother that he will praise God again and that God will be his delight (43:3-4), even if he doesn't feel it possible at thatmoment. The psalmist makes a deliberate decisionto put his hope in God (42 :5, 11, 43:5). He is entirely confident that God will respond - that God will send forth his light, guide him, and that he willbe with God on his Holy Mountain, where there isno chance of depression.

I tried, but failed, to reassure her that the procedure would be verystraightforward. 'Lord,' I prayed silently, 'Thismum is so anxious, please help me find the rightwords to say.' I found myself asking audibly, 'Doyou believe in God?' 'Yes,' she replied, 'I'm a Catholic.''Do you believe that God loves your child?' I asked.'I suppose he does, though I don't think I've thought about that before.' 'Well,' I said, 'I promise to pray that God will look after him if you do the same. He is more than able tosee him through the operation, don't you think?' Sheagreed hesitatingly, and the consultation came to anend. On admission to the ward some weeks later sheand her boy were given a 'parent and child' cubicle. Itvery soon became clear that things were not going tobe easy - this mother's anxiety level was 'sky-high'and made all our efforts to care for her boyexceptionally difficult. The operation came and wentuneventfully. The boy was discharged home after afew days. Some weeks later, the boy made his return visit to my clinic. His post-operative progress had beenuneventful - thankfully. When I thought theconsultation was finished, I said, 'So God answeredour prayers then?' She replied, 'Mr Fyfe, I think something strange is happening; I think God is trying to speak to me.' 'What makes you say that?' I asked, with another silent prayer. It was a fascinating story. On the way out of the local supermarket one morning, she had beenstruggling with her boy in one arm, and the bag offoodstuff in the other. A stranger helpfully opened theshop door and then offered to carry her shopping bagto her car in the car park. On the way there, thisunknown woman said, 'I hope you don't mind mesaying this but I'm a Christian, and as I was prayingthis morning, into my mind came a picture of a littleboy - and it was your boy. Do you mind if we pray fora minute?' So, there in the local car park, thisunknown lady prayed with a perfect stranger. 'Mr Fyfe, I think God is speaking to me.'T o this I readily agreed, and suggested that during the coming week she should simply ask Godto speak to her each day, and then read one of theGospels. She promised to come to our Church thefollowing Sunday morning.When she did arrive at Church that next Sunday, she was wearing what appeared to be a veryexpensive purplish (my wife says-lilac!) gown.Remarkably, the preacher that morning spoke onthe parable that Jesus told about the rich persondressed in purple 1. This lady quietly wept throughout the service. 16 TRIPLE HELIX IISUMMER 03witness Alasdair Fyfe shares a moving story of God breaking into the life of a mother of a three year-old patient God in hospital 'Mr Fyfe, I think God is speaking to me.' Patients entering hospital experience a variety of emotions and utilise differingcoping mechanisms to help them. Onesuch mechanism is the presence of a personal religious faith. 1Increasingly, it is recognised that faith and hope are valuable adjuncts to the healingprocess. 2,3Yet there has not been much research on doctors' roles in patients' spiritual affairs. Researchcarried out in a pulmonary outpatient departmentindicated that 94% of patients would welcomephysician enquiry into such issues but only 15% hadever had experience of this. 4Physicians themselves report varying approaches to spiritual assessment butthey affirmed that spiritual discussion should beapproached with sensitivity and integrity. 5 Method I carried out an 11-point interviewer-directed questionnaire survey to determine participants'religious backgrounds, practices and views regardingphysician enquiry into their spiritual beliefs. SouthBirmingham Local Research Ethics Committeeapproval was obtained. Hospital inpatients on acutewards in a Birmingham teaching hospital wererandomly selected (using the PAS computer databasesystem) for inclusion into the study between Augustand November 2001. Patients who lacked sufficientmental capacity to answer the questions posed wereexcluded. No patient refused to take part. Results The group of 43 patients was 53% female, 58% over 60 years of age and 98% white European. 63% saidthey were Christian but 56% never attended churchand only 18% attended weekly. 77% believed in God,but only 56% believed in life after death. 81% hadnever had a doctor enquire about their religiousSpirituality Elizabeth asks if doctors should enquire aboutMeetingReferenceswitness SUMMER 03 IITRIPLE HELIX 17At lunch in our home later she told me about her week. She said, 'I don't know what is happening tome. Normally I can't get up in the mornings, I'malways rushing frantically at the last minute to getthe children ready for school, things are usuallychaotic. This week, however, I've been wakening at6 am, and I'm desperate to read the Bible, and Ican't stop praying! I've learnt so much, and I feel somuch at peace.' This lady was radiant with a new-found joy that only Christ could bring, she had found the Lordwithout realising it. I said, 'I believe you have beenborn again. You asked God to speak to you, and hedid; you opened yourself to him and read his Word,and he has come - at your invitation.' There, in our lounge, I had the privilege of praying with this lady whom the loving God had carefully andpersistently sought and found. It was a special holy moment, and a fresh realisation for me that God willstop at nothing to seek and to find the lost so that hecame 'that they may have life and have it to the full'. 2 I thank God for a faithful unknown Christian lady ina shopping centre who dared to be obedient to herLord, who dared to pray with a stranger, not knowingthe response. I thank God for allowing me to witnessthe wonder of his new birth, the transforming work ofgrace in someone's life. And so it was. Her mind and heart were at peace, knowing that her God was in control. It made all thedifference in the world. 'Therefore, if anyone is inChrist, he is a new creation; the old has gone, thenew has come.' 3 Alasdair Fyfe is a Consultant Paediatrician in Glasgow beliefs, but 67% felt it was perfectly appropriate for doctors to do so and 44% felt that doctors should praywith patients. Only 28% felt it was inappropriate fordoctors to share their own religious beliefs if asked bythe patient. The demographic data reflected the demography of the Selly Oak area of Birmingham. Compared with arecent national census, the percentage of participantsdeclaring themselves as 'Christian' was relativelysmall. 6The small sample size arose because of time constraints and delay in obtaining ethics committeeapproval. Consequently, I did not perform statisticalanalysis. Discussion Spirituality has been defined as 'a quality that goes beyond religious affiliation, that strives for inspirations,reverence, awe, meaning and, purpose, even in thosethat do not believe in any god'. 7It has been argued that all individuals have a unique personal spirituality,irrespective of religious orientation. T raditionally, spiritual care has been perceived as a nursing role. 8Indeed, British nurse education has long acknowledged the importance of addressing spiritualissues in patient care. 9Interestingly through, over three quarters of nurses surveyed felt that spiritual carewas best provided by a multidisciplinary teamincluding a physician. 10 There is little data on physicians' roles in their patients' spiritual affairs. Reasons for this are unclear.Research amongst nurses has shown a number ofbarriers to spiritual care provision: lack of knowledgeof other religious faiths, time shortage, fear of personalprejudices. 11It is possible that these issues apply to medical staff as well. However, a survey carried outamongst American family physicians revealed that thevast majority felt that doctors could address religiousissues with patients; 37% had prayed with patients and 89% of these felt that that it had been of some help. 12 The issue of physicians sharing their own religious faith with patients is more contentious. Concernedthat doctors could abuse their authority and forcepersonal beliefs onto vulnerable patients, there hasbeen much debate amongst medical organisations oflate. 13The GMC have considered the matter: 'The Council has hitherto taken the view that the professionof personal opinions or faith is not of itself improperand that the Council could intervene only where therewas evidence that a doctor had failed to provide anadequate standard of care...it would not be right to tryto prevent doctors from expressing their personalreligious, political or other views to patients'. 14In this study, half of the patients would have welcomed suchdiscussion. Conclusion Spirituality appears to be an important issue amongst hospital inpatients. Whilst not guaranteeingrecovery from illness, spiritual beliefs act as copingmechanisms for hospitalised patients through illness.Medical staff should be aware of this dimension tohealthcare provision and endeavour to consider thespiritual needs of patients under their care. It isimperative that spiritual discussions between doctorand patient are broached sensitively and with thepatient's consent. This study adds to the literature bysuggesting that many patients feel it appropriate fordoctors to share their own religious beliefs and evenpray with consenting patients. I am planning anotherlarger study and encourage other CMF members toconsider doing the same.

Teenage pregnancy rates in England and Wales are four times tha t of the Netherlands, a fact often put down to the Dutch having more open attitudes to sex and earlier explicit sex education.

Each case history receives half a dozen pages. The author brings a compassionateviewpoint that demonstrates his wideexperiences as a psychotherapist andpreviously as a Church Social Worker,Deputy Children's Officer and Lecturer inHuman Growth and Behaviour. Althoughnot medically qualified, he shows anunderstanding of how physical andemotional problems are related, eg in thecase of 'Sula', who had depression andhypothyroidism. The author is strong on the psychological and psychiatric perspectiveand he derives a lot of his thought from theBible. Much of the bibliography comesfrom the counselling literature but this isnot an academic book. It will be of value toclergy, doctors, students of counselling andpastoral studies, but particularly toChristians who have emotional problems.As the back cover says, 'The reader isencouraged to consider whether theparticular problem or worry they have maybe a symptom of some deeper malaise ordysfunction - physical, mental or spiritual -and to feel comfortable about seeking theskills and empathy of a trained counselloror psychotherapist.'

Church- based responses to HIV andAIDS in three southern African countries Gideon Byamugisha, Lucy Steinitz, Glen Williams andPhumzile Zondi Strategies Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa andUNAIDS assisted the authors in writing this wellpresented and illustrated book. While defining'faith based' as having 'a religious affiliation', thebook focuses on the Christian tradition. Theintroduction states that growing numbers ofsecular leaders have come to appreciate theunique potential that churches and other faithbased organisations have for preventing thespread of HIV . It continues, 'Yet Christians havelacked sufficient urgency' the main reason being'the association in the collective mind... ofHIV/AIDS with immoral sexual behaviour.' Thishas led to 'judgmental attitudes' reinforcingdenial and secrecy on the part of people whobelieve themselves to be HIV positive. Christians might accept this apology in a book that is largely practical. It describes how churcheshave pioneered care of those infected with andaffected by the disease. It contains inspired ideassuch as encouraging an infected mother to keep amemory box of photos, possessions, a book ofmemories and other documents that she canleave to her children. There are testimonies ofhow HIV positive individuals have responded bycoming to faith in Christ and intensifying thequality of their care for others. But not all practical ideas are harmless. There is considerable promotion of condom use,particularly in Roman Catholic projects. Whilethere may be a place for their use by somemarried couples there is no clear warning of themany harmful knock-on effects of promotingpromiscuity, whether intentionally orunintentionally. Much promotion of condom useelsewhere is based on secular humanist teachingthat is opposed to biblical teaching and theChristian's good news. I would only place this book in a library after warning potential, unsuspecting Christian readersof its hidden dangers that emanate mainly fromthe West. I would at the same time recommendits many excellent ideas and commend thereaders to join in communal repentance for oursins of omission and commission that arecontributing to this terrible pandemic.

Do you wantto be a more effectivewitness? This book, written by an Honorary Lecturer inEpidemiology at the London Hospital,champions the biblical theme of building thebody of Christ in the local church. It suggeststhat God-honouring relationships are anintegral part of Gospel living that we haveneglected to our detriment. Paul's doctrinal teaching has been a tremendous resource for the church over thecenturies but his teaching on relationships, whichis also extensive, has been under-emphasised.This has resulted in an unbalanced andindividualistic Christian experience that maymake us frustrated with our failure to continue togrow and failure to witness effectively. Despite years of belonging to church, we are likely to find that the biblical qualities of givingtime, listening well, serving practically, offeringencouragement, learning by apprenticeship andmaintaining our walk with God by mutualaccountability are not as evident in our fellowshipas they might be. How refreshing it would be ifwe moved in such an environment! This book points the way towards developing a Christian community that not only pays lipservice to loving out brothers and sisters, but aimsto live it out in the confidence of God's love andforgiveness for us all. Shared life activelystrengthens sound doctrine but also provides asafe place to express doubt and admit struggle.

Kevin Vaughan is a General Practitioner in Birmingham and immediate past Chairman of CMF Culture of Life - Culture of Death The Linacre Centre for Healthcare Ethics, London2002Ed: Luke Gormally\u00a317.95 Pb 352 ppISBN 0 90656 124 8 This book consists of 22 papers by historians,legal and political theorists, medical practitioners, pastors,philosophers and theologians, delivered at theInternational Conference on 'The GreatJubilee and the Culture of Life' held atQueen's College, Cambridge in July 2000.This was organised for Roman Catholics withan active interest in healthcare ethics inresponse to Pope John Paul II's invitation tocelebrate the year 2000. Luke Gormally, Director of the Linacre Centre for Healthcare Ethics, a Catholic think-tank, explains that this book deals with the'Clash of orthodoxies' - contemporary liberalsecularism versus Judaeo-Christian moraltradition, two cultures with deeply opposedunderstandings of human life. The coverpicture, Gernt van Honthorst's Christ before the High Priest , symbolises the confrontation between the culture of death and the culture oflife. It was Caiaphas, the High Priest, whouttered the prototypical consequentialistjudgement, 'You do not realise that it is betterfor you that one man die for the people than thewhole nation perish.' (John 11:50). Willingnessto sacrifice the innocent for 'the greater good' iscentral to the philosophy of the culture ofdeath. However there was prophetic truth inCaiaphas' words beyond their intendedmeaning. Christ's redeeming death brought amessage of life and hope to the world. The ultimate source of the culture of life is our LordJesus in his life, death and resurrection. Cardinal Winning's opening address identifies characteristic manifestations of the culture ofdeath: abortion, embryo experimentation andimperialist imposition of contraception andabortion policies on developing countries. Theroot of this culture is 'the eclipse of the sense ofGod and man'. Among four chapters on theculture of death, is a fascinating one about thede-Christianising of England. This one tracesthe evolution of secular philosophy that hasprofoundly influenced contemporary medicalethics eg from key thinkers such as JS Mill. Inher on Human Fertilisation andEmbryology in 1984, Baroness Warnock appealsto Mill for her justification of relativism.Chapters on the culture of life deal with itstheology, promotion, politics and medicine inthe developing world. Examples of Christianinitiatives bringing hope to destitute mothers,combating the spread of AIDS and caring forAIDS victims are eloquently described.Supplementary papers deal with eugenicgenetic engineering, stem cell research,contraception and 'quality of life' ethics. This Roman Catholic publication inevitably refers to classic papal encyclicals and traditionalRoman doctrines without scriptural foundationsuch as the ban on 'artificial' contraception, thecelibacy of priests, the 'sacrifice' of the Massand human suffering sharing in the redemptionaccomplished by Christ. Some of these willappear to evangelicals to detract from the gloryand atoning work.Nevertheless, read with discernment, there ismuch here that is valuable, thought provokingand consistent with a true biblical medical ethic,to interest, stimulate and challenge theChristian doctor. Stephen Browne is a GP Principal in Birmingham Doctors and Patients: an anthology 993 1 Analysis of the current trend in narrative-basedmedicine reveals, as thewriter of Ecclesiastesindicated, that there is nothing new under the sun. The increasing number of books andarticles on the role of narrative and the use ofthe arts in medicine is rooted in history and notin post modernity. It is part of this heritage thatthis book explores. Edited by Cecil Helman,General Practitioner, Medical Anthropologistand creator of Helman's folk model used inconsultation skills, this anthology bringstogether a selection of narratives from theperspective of doctors and patients, as well asfrom the clinical encounter itself. Some of thesestories are fictional, some true but all are rootedin an experience of health and illness.Contributors include world famous authors likeFranz Kafka and A J Cronin, who wrote DrFinlay's Casebook, and more modern, less well-known writers. The collected narratives relate many key issues that doctors and patients meet in day- to-day life. The reader is drawn into the story andcomes to understand the value of experientiallearning, the difficulties in telling and hearingthe truth, the problems of managing uncertaintyand of the hurts caused by dysfunctionalcommunication. The reader experiences anemotional roller coaster, moving from laughterto tears in a few short sentences in the world ofterminal and chronic illness. The anthology also acknowledges the time spent in health care by people who are worriedbut well, people who attend frequently andpeople who have problems with addiction.Their stories encourage empathy andchallenge the reader's prejudices andpreconceptions. Overall, the book encouragesreflection on the whole person - physical,emotional and spiritual. T o quote Oliver Sacks, neurologist and author of 'The Man who Mistook his Wife for a Hat',from his contribution to the book about a younglady called Rebecca: 'A child follows the Biblebefore he follows Euclid. Not because the Bibleis simpler (the reverse might be said) butbecause it is cast in a symbolic and narrativemode.' This book, being full of stories, is simpleto read but within it lie many challenges to usboth as doctors and Christians. With theincreasing secular medical interest in narrative,it is worth reading to increase awareness ofcurrent trends in the medical world. I wouldalso recommend this book for those involved inteaching communication skills or in medicaleducation generally.

In his article 'The morning-after pill - how does it really work?' complex argumentsof extrapolation his the evidence 'strongly suggests that[the morning-after pill] can disruptimplantation'. He gives the impression thathe wishes the evidence to support his view,which was recently rejected by the HighCourt in the UK. Has Howard taken his arguments to a journal such as the Lancet for robust debate? In the interests of intellectual honesty, howabout inviting a response from HoraciaoCroxatto, author of 'Emergencycontraception pills: www.ippf.org ). His acknowledges the uncertaintyabout precise modes of action. You couldalso ask Schering Healthcare since theirdeputy medical director is quoted, or one of the investigators in the UK arm of theWHO study. Phil Howard replies. In the Judicial Review of the morning after pill (MAP), Mr Justice Munby held thatMAP could not be abortifacient as 'if it is tobe effective, [it] has in any event to be takenat a time - no later than 72 hours afterintercourse - when implantation will nothave begun'. The court accepted thatimplantation began around 4 days afterfertilisation. This ignores two points. First, the 72-hour period is the time before the pill is given and this lag time must not be confused with theduration of action after drug ingestion .Moreover, this refers to the first dose, the second being taken 12 hours later.Following ingestion, levonorgestrel will sayin the blood for up to 25 hours and will actthrough de novo protein synthesis. Hence,its effects will last for days. Second, MAPcan actually be given up to 120 hours afterunprotected intercourse and still beeffective. While it remains clear that MAPcannot cause an implanted egg to de-implant, this does mean that MAP can beactive during the period of receptivity todisrupt implantation. Hilary Cooling rightly draws attention to the WHO trial published in the Lancet in 1998. At entry to this trial, urine or bloodsamples were taken for pregnancy tests butthere was no requirement for these samplesto be analysed prior to enrolment - contraryto the usual canons of research ethics. It istherefore likely that some women were inthe early stages of pregnancy at enrolment.Only the samples of women found to havesustained a clinical pregnancy during thetrial were analysed, so we cannot know howmany women lost early pregnancies.Moreover, we know that up to a third ofwomen continued to have intercourse aftertaking MAP (in breach of the trial protocol),so its effects were almost certainly on morethan one act of intercourse. As far as I amaware the ethics of this trail have not beenpublicly challenged. For many with a conscientious objection to the use of abortifacient pills, the moralobjection is not the interruption ofpregnancy, but rather the destruction ofearly human life. There is a 'moleculardialogue' between the embryo and motherstarting within hours of fertilisation. This'cross-talk' prepares the endometrium forimplantation. Surely, to prevent implantationfrom occurring is no different to disruptingimplantation once it has occurred? MAP isdestructive of human life at any time afterfertilisation, when human life starts. 'From Medicine to Miracle' by Dr Mary Self Deborah Pitt , Staff Grade Psychiatrist in Glamorgan, finds the criticism in Dr PeterMay's book review rather harsh. Having read the book by Dr Mary Self 'From Medicine to Miracle' and Dr May'sreview ( Triple Helix 2003;Winter: 19), I thought his criticism rather harsh. It isreasonable to highlight any inconsistency inthe details of the healing from cancer thatDr Self received, and which she attributes toher faith in Christ. Nevertheless, I wasconcerned about his reaction to her style ofrelating the diagnosis of bone cancer andthe subsequent development of her faith.Perhaps such stark honesty and rawemotion is unfamiliar to Dr May, and I foundthe book sometimes uncomfortable reading.However, he was so dismissive of the realityand anguish of her suffering and desperatesearch for God that he appears to havemissed the point. Dr Self's story is essentiallyone from rebellion and ambivalence to faithand trust in the Lord and is more valuablefor her 'warts and all' portrayal. Christine Walter , CMF member from Blackburn, agrees. When I had finished reading Dr Self's account of her illness and healing, I wrote toher to thank her for her honesty about herfeelings. I found this insight particularlyhelpful as I too was experiencing 'an endlessroller-coaster ride of emotions'. I was quitetaken aback that Dr May found this'tiresome'. On a more serious note, I was shocked to read Dr May accusing Mary of not tellingthe truth about her illness. Mary was facingdeath from an untreatable metastasis, asdiagnosed by her oncologist. Now she iswell and enjoying life with the children shewas told she would never have. As well asbeing healed from cancer, she was set freefrom fear and experienced God's love in anew and powerful way. I believe it was amiracle and I expect the 10,000 people whowere praying think so too. 22 TRIPLE HELIX IISUMMER 03 The completely resdesigned CMF website is now available on CD-ROMcontaining over 800 articles, reviewsand reports including: 19 editions of Triple Helix, the CMF doctors' journal 41 editions of Nucleus, the CMF Students' journal 12 years of CMF government submissions on Ethics The Doctors' Life Support, a year's supply of daily devotions The complete CMF Files on Medical Ethics The complete Confident Christianity evangelism training course Five years of news summaries on medical ethics...and much moreNew CMF CD-ROM \u00a35 To order see the THOUGHTS When prayer seems SUMMER 03 IITRIPLE HELIX 23There's no heavenly insurance policy exempting people from life's realities, writes Janet Goodall . But that's not the end of the story. I n Disappointment with God , Philip Yancey reflects on those whose faith in God is seriously shaken byseemingly unanswered prayer. 1Although earnestly asked to intervene, the Almighty still allows devastating wars. Disabling accidents or overwhelming illnesses arrive that provefatal, despite prayers for and even claims of healing. The cata logue of permitted evil seems endless: child, drug and trust abuseabound, famines and earthquakes persist, terrorism and torturecontinue. We may be involved personally in some of thesetraumas. There is no heavenly insurance policy protectingChristians against strained or sundered relationships, failedexaminations, poverty or homelessness; we are not immune to theconstant strain of hope deferred. Where is God? Why does heseem so distant and deaf? There aren't any easy answers. Throughout the Bible, God's people were kept waiting, their faith tested yet strengthened i n the process. Abraham was 100 years old by the time God's 25-yea r- old promise was met in Isaac's birth. 2Joseph was in his thirties when he was catapulted from prison to premiership and saw histeenage dreams realised. 3Moses was 80 years old when he found his true vocation and spent another 40 years struggling to fulf il it.4 Amongst many others, Job, Jeremiah and Hosea all knew painful times of great darkness and distress. Our Lord Jesus Christ knew dark times. On the cross, he cried out, 'My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?'5By carrying infirmities, sorrows and sins to the cross, he was able to offe r us his liberating, guiding and energising Spirit.6Still, he neither exempts us from pains and perplexities nor readily explains them to us.7YetPaul spoke of delighting in his lengthy list of afflictions.8He had confidence in the Lord's personal promise, offered in the midst of pain, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made per fect in weakness'.9Good reasons for holding onto God's promise: 'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you'.10 Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have summoned you by name; you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and when you pass through the rivers, they will not sweep over you. When you walk through the fire, you will not be burned; the flames will not s et you ablaze...Since you are precious and honoured in my sight, and bec ause I love you...Do not be afraid, for I am with you...(Isaiah 43: 1-2, 4 -5) We need to cling to these promises, anchoring unstable feelings in the unshakeable fact that our loving Lord is with us, come w hat may. With this assurance, may we emerge from our trials with fa ith strengthened and encouragement to share. Janet Goodall is a retired consultant paediatrician 1 Yancey P . Disappointment with God .
