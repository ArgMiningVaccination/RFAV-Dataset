In most host species, the disease primarily affects the reproductive system [ [9](#B9)], with major clinical manifestation of brucellosis in wildlife and cattle being abortion, decreased fertility, and placenta retention [ [27](#B27), [35](#B35)]. Brucellosis has been known to exist in wildlife populations [ [10](#B10)]. Wild rats are known to harbor Brucella organisms [ [17](#B17), [36](#B36)] and have found to be infected with Brucella (B.) abortus on farms where cattle were infected [ [17](#B17)]. In Siberia and the Far East, gray rats were found to be a carrier of brucellosis [ [19](#B19)]. The occurrence of disease in humans is largely dependent on the occurrence of brucellosis in wildlife reservoirs [ [12](#B12)]. [2](#B2)- [4](#B4)]. Vertical infection among offspring born to infected dams constitutes a major problem in eradication of brucellosis [ [34](#B34)]. Successful eradication programs of brucellosis requires the elimination of brucellosis from the primary reservoir of the disease as well as free ranging wildlife, development of intervention measures against congenital brucellosis, use of efficacious vaccine and implementation of biosecurity measures [ [2](#B2), [10](#B10), [26](#B26)]. [28](#B28)]. RB51 is a stable rough mutant derived from the standard virulent B. abortus strain 2308 [ [28](#B28)] and research data suggests that it induces protection in bison and cattle against abortion or infection with virulent B. abortus strains [ [20](#B20)- [22](#B22)]. Our previous study had demonstrated vertical transmission of B. abortus biotype 1 in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats [ [2](#B2)]. In this study we verified the protective capacity of RB51 vaccine in the SD rats against infection as well as vertical transmission of the virulent B. abortus biotype 1 Korean bovine isolate. Materials and Methods Experimental rats Vaccination and challenge of rats Clinical examinations Breeding of rats Collection of tissues Bacteriologic studies [1](#B1), [28](#B28)]. Polymerase chain reaction [16](#B16)]. For Bruce-ladder multiplex PCR profiling, DNA was extracted from Brucella suspected colonies by a genomic DNA extraction kit (AccuPrep DNA Extraction Kit; Bioneer, Korea) using the manufacturer's protocol. total in the sera of RB51-vaccinated and non-vaccinated control rats 3 weeks post challenge or at necropsy were measured by ELISA using smooth lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of B. abortus biotype 1. The LPS was extracted from the B. abortus biotype 1 by a commercial LPS extraction kit (Intron Biotechnology, Korea) using manufacturer's protocol. Flat-bottomed 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates (Nunc, Denmark) were coated with 100 \u00b5L of LPS (5 \u00b5g/mL) of B. abortus biotype 1 suspended in 0.05 mM sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6). Affinity purified rat IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a (Bethyl Laboratories, USA) were used to coat the 96-well plate starting from 500 ng/well to 7.8 ng/well to generate the standard curve. Each plate was incubated at 4 overnight. Plates were washed three times with wash solution [PBST: PBS (pH 7.4) with 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20]. Each well of the antigen-coated plates were blocked with 200 \u00b5L of blocking solution of 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma Aldrich, USA) in PBS and incubated at 37 for 30 min. Then the plates were washed three times with PBST. Each sample of sera was diluted 1 : 100 in sample diluent (50 mM tris, 0.14 M Nacl, 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) and 100 \u00b5L of diluted serum was added to duplicate wells of a 96-wells plate. The plates were sealed and incubated at 37 for 1 h. After five washing cycles with PBST, each well was incubated with 100 \u00b5L of 1 : 100,000 dilution of 0.14 M Nacl, 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0), and the plates incubated at 37 for 1 h. After five washings as described above, the color reaction was developed by adding 200 \u00b5L/well of a solution containing 1.0 mg/mL of O-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD; Sigma, USA) in buffer 4.0) with 0.04% (v/v) H2O2. The plates were incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature then the colorimetric reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 \u00b5L/well of 3 M H2SO4. The absorbance measurements were made at 492 nm, using an automatic ELISA plate reader (Tecan, Austria). Statistical analysis Results Clinical signs Pregnancy rate, litter size, offspring weight and survival data [Table 1](#T1). Dam and offspring infections At necropsy, 3 of 16 RB51-vaccinated rats were seroconverted according to RBPAT, standard tube agglutination test and ELISA. All rats in the non-vaccinated group showed B. abortus specific antibody responses at necropsy and pregnant rats in this group had lower (p < 0.05) standard tube agglutination titers (314 \u00b1 26) when compared to the non-pregnant rats (411 \u00b1 11). The RB51-vaccinated rats had significantly lower (p < 0.001) standard tube agglutination titers (83 \u00b1 14) non-vaccinated rats at necropsy ( [Fig. 2](#F2)). Our ELISA data also showed (p < 0.001) IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a titers in the sera of RB51-vaccinated rats compared to non-vaccinated control rats at 3 weeks post challenge [ [24](#B24)], despite animal control and eradication programs. Control of brucellosis in animals is essential for its control in humans [ [13](#B13)]. The current brucellosis control programs in many parts of the world, including Korea, are based on test and slaughter of sero-positive cattle [ [33](#B33)]. If the slaughter of infected herds is limited to sero-positive adult animals, the latently infected calves could be a source of infection to the new farm [ [15](#B15)]. Another likely source for reintroduction of brucellosis into livestock is from infected populations of free-ranging wildlife [ [10](#B10)]. To control bovine brucellosis in endemic areas, the wild animals need to be free from brucellosis. Congenital infection caused by B. abortus in domesticated and wild animals is significant in the epizootiology of brucellosis [ [2](#B2), [34](#B34)] as eradication of brucellosis could not be achieved without preventing vertical transmission. The need to develop intervention measures against congenital brucellosis in wild and domesticated animals prompted us to evaluate the RB51 vaccine on the protection of infection and vertical transmission against B. abortus biotype 1 in a SD rat model. [11](#B11)]. The data of this study demonstrated that the pregnancy rate was higher in RB51-vaccinated rats (100%) compared with non-vaccinated rats (56.25%), and the mean litter size was also significantly higher in RB51-vaccinated rats (11.50 \u00b1 1.31) in comparison to the non-vaccinated rats (9.88 \u00b1 1.45) (p > 0.05). In addition, the mean weight of day-old live offspring was significantly higher in RB51-vaccinated rats (6.93 \u00b1 0.32) compare to 0.31) (p < 0.001). B. abortus causes loss in productivity of animals by abortion, infertility, decrease in milk production and birth of weak and dead calves through reproductive tract infection [ [9](#B9)]. In this study, 2 of 16 (12.5%) uteri of RB51-vaccinated pregnant rats and 7 of 9 (77.78%) non-vaccinated pregnant rats were found to be infected with B. abortus 10 weeks after challenge. The significant difference of pregnancy rate, litter size and weight of offspring between RB51-vaccinated and non-vaccinated rats in our studies indicated that RB51-vaccine elicited significant protection against infection in vaccinated rats when compared to non-vaccinated rats. [6](#B6), [26](#B26)]. [26](#B26)]. In the current study, isolation of B. abortus biotype 1 was performed from the spleen, liver, kidney, lung and uterus, as these are most frequently infected tissue in B. abortus infected animals [ [7](#B7)]. At necropsy, we recorded a low level of persistence of B. abortus in the maternal tissues of RB51-vaccinated rats (18.75%) compared to the non-vaccinated rat (100%). Localization of B. abortus was primarily recorded in the lymphoid and uterine tissues of the non-vaccinated rat. Results of our bacteriological data suggest that vaccination with RB51 was efficacious in preventing intrauterine and fetal infection following exposure to virulent strain of B. abortus. [18](#B18)]. In the present study, all of the non-vaccinated control rats were found to be infected with B. abortus biotype 1 following experimental challenge with 1.5 \u00d7 B. abortus biotype 1. [5](#B5), lack of antibody response in RB51 vaccinates is most likely due to the absence of O-antigen [ [5](#B5), [7](#B7), [28](#B28), [29](#B29)]. After challenging with B. abortus biotype 1 all rats gave positive results in the serological tests used in this study. [14](#B14), [30](#B30), [32](#B32)]. Our serological tests did not detect antibody responses induced by strain RB51 6 weeks after vaccination. Antibody responses in the present study were detected only after challenge with B. abortus biotype 1. Serological data in this study showed low antibody titers in the RB51-vaccinated rats compared to non-vaccinated rats following challenge with B. abortus biotype 1. The low recovery rate of B. abortus biotype 1 in the vaccinated rats might have been responsible for the reduction of sero-converted antibody titers in RB51-vaccinated rats compared to non-vaccinated rats. Bison vaccinated with RB51 also showed lower standard tube agglutination titers as compared to non-vaccinated control following an experimental challenge with B. abortus 2308 [ [21](#B21)]. In mice, RB51 vaccine caused no increase of antibody titers over non-vaccinated control following a challenge with B. [ [14](#B14)]. [28](#B28), [31](#B31)]. [14](#B14), [31](#B31)]. The RB51 induces a good CMI response in cattle [ [31](#B31)], and mice were reported to be protected by RB51 vaccine against B. abortus 2308 through CMI response [ [14](#B14), [32](#B32)]. The RB51 vaccine in mice and bison significantly reduced the recovery of virulent B. abortus 2308 compared to non-vaccinated controls [ [14](#B14), [21](#B21)]. In our study, B. abortus isolation rate was lower in the RB51-vaccinated group compared to the non-vaccinated control group, suggesting that the RB51 vaccine in SD rats might have played an important role for the intracellular killing of challenged bacteria in various organs (spleen, liver, kidney, lung and uterus) through CMI response. [2](#B2)]. We vaccinated SD rats with RB51 through the intraperitoneal route because other studies showed that this route confers the best protection in mice against B. abortus compared to subcutaneous and oral routes [ [14](#B14), [25](#B25)]. Under field conditions, the intraperitoneal route may not be a good option for vaccinating wildlife. Further studies are required for the development of an effective vaccine delivery system for free ranging wildlife under field conditions. Our data suggests that the RB51 vaccine is effective in protecting SD rats against infection and vertical transmission of B. abortus. Therefore, RB51 vaccine would be beneficial in reducing the prevalence of B. abortus in the wild rat to facilitate eradication of brucellosis in humans and animals. "}
