Today, I am sharing with you a complete guide to holistic healing. So, what is it and how you can practice it. I actually got introduced to this lifestyle through my witchcraft practice and some wellness influencers I follow. It was truly inspiring to see them follow this way of living and it, in return, encouraged me to make more research and follow different holistic practices. Now, let's get into and don't forget to check out my previous post: [6 WAYS TO PRACTICE MINDFULNESS](https://mademoiselleolantern.com/2022/01/31/6-ways-to-practice-mindfulness/)! A Complete Guide To Holistic Healing What is holistic healing? According to WebMD (2020), Holistic medicine is a form of healing that considers the whole person - so body, mind, spirit, and emotions - in the quest for optimal health and wellness. According to the holistic medicine philosophy, one can achieve such a thing by gaining proper balance in life. A balance of work, creativity, social life, nutrition, movement, relationships, home life, and so much more. It's the belief that if people have imbalances (whether it is physical, emotional, or spiritual) in their lives, it can negatively affect their overall health. Holistic healing bases itself on five pillars: mind, emotions, spirit, physical and social. In this next section, I will detail each of these aspects and share tips on how to start your holistic journey! How to practice it? Clear Your Mind The first step to practicing holistic healing is by clearing your mind. In general, clearing your mind involves creating a relaxed, calm, and empty space within your mind so you may fill it up with good stuff. Such as, worrying less, being more present, and not letting the little things bother you. It will teach you how to dial back and slow down your brain. Two ways you can clear your mind are through meditation or [practicing mindfulness](https://mademoiselleolantern.com/2022/01/31/6-ways-to-practice-mindfulness/) on a daily basis. My morning routine actually includes meditating for 10 minutes to start the day well and on a clean slate. Nurture your spirit and heal emotional traumas The second step is to nurture your spirit and heal emotional traumas. Connecting to your spirit is the essence of who you are. It's your core self. Journaling is a wonderful way you can get in touch with your soul and, notably to find out what emotions and traumas are weighing on you. I would recommend journaling because it is an action, a preparation, and a declaration that you are ready for change. There's something more rewarding to write something down, rather than just think it. Moreover, we cannot write as fast as we can think, so by sitting down and writing our thoughts, we slow down our brain. We take the time to think and reflect, to peel back the layers of a situation or behavior, and hence, bring new things to the surface. Strengthen your body The next step to healing naturally is to strengthen your body. When I say that, I don't mean lifting weights, I mean eating correctly, cutting bad habits (smoking, junk food, sugar intake), adopting some healing modalities (such as massages, acupuncture, crystal healing...), and moving your body (such as working out, yoga or jogging). I mentioned this several times on my blog but your physical self is what hosts your soul and it deserves to be treated like a temple. It deserves to be taken care of. Find Your Tribe The last step to practicing holistic health is by finding your tribe. Finding your tribe is about having fellow compassionate human beings who have your back. It's having a friend or a group of friends you can call at any time and just be you. One way you can start nurturing the social aspect of your life is by calling a friend once a week at least and actually opening up to them. Be vulnerable and transparent. I know that it is sometimes easier to isolate yourself because you may feel like a burden or you're afraid to be judged. But, it's important to know that by not reaching out, you are denying your friends the chance to help you. Also, think that if your friend is in pain, you'd want them to reach out to you.
