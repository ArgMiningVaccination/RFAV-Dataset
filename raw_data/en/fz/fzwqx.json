Veterinarians have a unique opportunity to expand their practice scope into more aspects of the health of transition cows. The veterinarian's role in the health of the transition cow is the focus of this year's meeting. On Thursday and Friday, Dr. Daryl Nydam and Dr. Nigel Cook have a very intensive program planned to present the latest in transition cow facilities, monitoring, immunity, and overall management. www.ohiodairyvets.org https://tinyurl.com/y7xhlq5r Saturday will consist of Dr. Je ff Hayes discussing the latest in diagnostic testing in dairy practice. There will also be a practice tips session and practitioner roundtable so that we can learn more from our colleagues.

USDBUIRS00075Introducing Imrestor (pegbovigrastim injection)\u2014 the first-of-its-kind immune restorative for periparturient dairy cows and heifers, available only by veterinary prescription. During the critical time around calving when a dairy cow's immune system is suppressed, Imrestor helps restore the integrity of a cow's innate immune system to reduce the incidence of clinical mastitis by 28% in the first 30 days of lactation in periparturient dairy cows and periparturient replacement dairy heifers, helping protect her potential and the well-being of the entire dairy.It's just the helping hand a dairy producer needs.Important Safety Information: No withdrawal period or milk discard time is required. In case of accidental self-injection, wash the site of injection thoroughly with clean running water. Foreign proteins such as pegbovigrastim have the potential to cause anaphylactic-type reactions. Do not use Imrestor to treat cows with clinical mastitis because effectiveness has not been demonstrated for this use. Some cases of hypersensitivity-type reactions have been observed in studies. Abomasal ulcerations/erosions were observed in safety studies; it was concluded that these findings were not clinically relevant. Please see Brief Summary of full Prescribing Information for additional information. To help protect the whole herd with Imrestor as part of an ongoing herd health management program, contact your veterinarian or Elanco representative.Visit www.HelpProtectYourDairyHerd.com to learn more.Page 12Cold weather used to get your calves down, but now they're singing a different tune.

Short -stay maternity pen -where cows are moved to the maternity pen less than 2 days before they calve 3. Long -stay maternity pen -where cows are moved into the maternity pen more than 7 days before they calveShort -Stay Maternity Pen Cows within 2 days of calving avoid social contact and do not appear to be as affected by regrouping stress as cows 2 -7 days before calving The success of this approach depends on the ability of workers to predict calving 2 days prior to the event This approach is therefore more applicable to smaller herds, typically less than ~ 250 cows, where dry cow groups are small and social stresses less than in larger herds. The elements critical to the success of short -stay maternity pens are: Excellent stockmanship and timing of calving A group maternity pen -to avoid prolonged isolation of individual cows Page 70Most common approach in smaller herds 30-35' (9 -10m) Bedding retainer Water trough with access from concrete feed alley side only~100 sqft(10 sq m) per cow at max fill 30-35' 12-14' Water trough with access from concrete feed alley side onlyBedding retainerBedded area Concrete feed alleyBedded Pack Guidelines 54% 15 % 32% 2011 Data from 201 freestall housed herds >200 cowsTCI\u00aeand Days in Calving Pen prefresh cows 2 -6 days before calving -negative impact on the cow Maternity Pen Options 1.

Short -stay maternity pen -where cows are moved to the maternity pen less than 2 days before they calve 3. Long -stay maternity pen -where cows are moved into the maternity pen more than 7 days before they calveLong -Stay Maternity Pen With this strategy, we try to move cows into the mate rnity pen more than 7 days before calving. It is virtually impossible to predict that an individual cow will calve in 7 days - but a group approach can be taken in herds more than ~350 cows The concept is to move a group of cows from the dry cow group to a maternity pen each week -with a group pen of sufficient capacity to accommodate a week of calving cows, and sufficient separate maternity pens to accommodate each group until they all calve, with the minimum of regrouping. Page 71Long -Stay Maternity Pen Typically, 85 -95% of cows calve over a 14 -day period around 280 days carried calf (DCC). This spread should be examined in the individual herd and the appropriate DCC selected to optimize the 14 -day period chosen to accommodate the majority of the cows, while ensuring that most cows spend more than 7 days in the maternity pen.

Baffles serve to redirect the air down toward the cow - ideal for cross -vent barns over head to head stalls Each baffle adds ~ 0.017 \" Hg static pressure to the barn Page 154Problems Between the Baffles Air trapped between baffles Retractable baffles for the winter -do they help prevent trapping of air?

Now specify the ventilation by body mass or ACH ... not air speed and put fans over the stalls Hybrid Barns Use a combination of mechanical and natural ventilation approaches Attractive in more moderate climates with hot summers and cold winters vs 'hot all year round'Hybrid Barns Mechanically ventilate in the summer and transitional periods, 'naturally' ventilate in the winter Manage the ridge opening -curtain or cupola Side wall curtains along the length of the barn (maybe partial) Can let the cows outside!
