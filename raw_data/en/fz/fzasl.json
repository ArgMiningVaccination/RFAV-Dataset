We are happy with the successful integration and strong start of the new Flow Control business line as part of Valmet.In addition to the merger, we continued smaller-scale strategic acquisitions to strengthen Valmet's offering and local presence in growth areas.

We are collaborating closely with our customers to enable carbon neutral production in their mills and plants, and we have successfully started to engage with the highest emitting suppliers in our supplier sustainability engagement program, where CO2 emissions reduction is one of the key targets. Furthermore, to support our customers in the green transition, we launched a new R&D and innovation program called Beyond Circularity. The program aims to further strengthen Valmet's R&D work to develop process technologies, automation and services to utilize renewable materials and recycled, waste and sidestreams.

Good resilience and adaptation capability in a continuously changing world During the year, we have succeeded on many fronts, moving Valmet, our work community and our customers' performance forward. Together with our customers, we have truly made a difference. The global turbulence due to the war in Ukraine and economic and political developments is expected to continue. Past years have shown that we at Valmet can adapt well to continuous changes and will also continue to remain resilient in the changing environment in the future. I thank every Valmeteer for their excellent work and commitment in moving Valmet and our customers' performance forward. I want to express my warmest thanks to our customers around the world for the trust you have shown. I am looking forward to our continued collaboration in 2023!

The focus of this program is on the one hand on finding new applications and customer segments for existing products and expanding our offering to existing segments, and on the other hand on developing new technologies and offerings for emerging new market segments. In 2022, the program was reviewed. Industrial Internet, Filtration, Emission Control, Biomass Concepts, Nonwovens, Recycled and Cellulose-based Textile Fibers and 3D/Molded Fiber continue as part of the program. The new 3D/Molded fiber Business Accelerator is tackling global environmental challenges by creating sustainable solutions for the world's packaging needs. The novel molded fiber products are manufactured from wood fiber with the objective of replacing plastic. In 2022, Valmet and Mets\u00e4 Group's innovation company Mets\u00e4 Spring began the operations at the 3D fiber product pilot plant in \u00c4\u00e4nekoski, Finland. The greenfield pilot plant enables further research into and development of the new wood-based packaging solution and its production process. Valmet has developed technology for both recycling textile waste and making textile fiber from biomass or organic waste. In 2022, Valmet continued to contribute to this important industry with technology deliveries to two major developments in this area. In cooperation with Renewcell, the start-up of the world's first commercial-scale textile recycling plant commenced in Sundsvall, Sweden, while the Spinnova-Suzano joint venture textile fiber factory is being built in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland.

The Boards of Directors of Valmet and Neles Corporation signed a combination agreement and merger plan to combine the two companies through a merger on July 2, 2021. The Extraordinary General Meetings of Valmet and Neles resolved to approve the merger of Neles into Valmet on September 22, 2021. On March 21, 2022, Valmet announced that the companies had received all the competition approvals for the merger. The combination of Valmet's and Neles' business operations was completed on April 1, 2022, creating a company with a unique offering for the global process industries and 17,500 professionals around the world. The merged company Neles became Valmet's fifth business line, called Flow Control. After the merger, Valmet's business lines are Services, Flow Control, Automation Systems, Paper, and Pulp and Energy. The Automation Systems business line was previously called Automation. A leading company The merger had a strong strategic rationale. After the merger, Valmet is a leading company with a unique, competitive and balanced total offering for process industries globally. It has strong positions in its respective segments, including flow control, automation systems and services as well as board, paper, pulp and energy technologies. Valmet is also well-positioned to benefit from the strong sustainability focus in the combined company's end markets, such as energy transition and increasing demand for renewables. Services, automation systems and flow control are characterized by predictable and growing demand, long-term customer relationships with recurring business driven by the installed base and customer operating rates. This creates opportunities to exceed market growth, increase profitability and maintain a strong financial profile with end-market diversification across the process and energy industries. Further growth opportunities in automation With the Flow Control business line as part of Valmet, the company has a solid platform for further growth in the automation sphere, consisting of automation systems, automation products and flow control solutions. Valmet has a leading position in process-critical valves and valve automation products, pulp and paper automation systems, analyzers, and measurements. We also continuously develop technology for new applications, including green hydrogen. Valmet also has growth potential in these sectors and through the increased penetration into energy and process industry end markets. Valmet has an excellent track record and a strong capability in integrating and developing acquired businesses. This is well- evidenced in Valmet's successful growth of its Automation business and multiple acquisitions over the past few years. Integration proceeding as planned The integration of Flow Control into Valmet is proceeding according to plan. Active sales and marketing of Valmet's combined offering commenced soon after the merger was completed, and the implementation of several cost synergy actions regarding function costs, common locations and the supply chain continued during the rest of the year. Valmet expects to generate annual run rate synergies of approximately EUR 25 million, of which approximately 60 percent are expected to be achieved by the end of 2023, and approximately 90 percent by the end of 2024.The merger created a leading company with unique offering Unique, competitive and balanced total offering for process industries Large recurring and stable business, providing resilience to business cycles Strong industrial logic from the combination of flow control and automation systems Solid platform for further growth in flow control and automation systems Revenue, technology development and cost synergy potential, contributing to shareholder value creation valmet | annual review 2022 || strategy | neles merger completed33 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Valmet's Way Forward Progress of Must-Win actions Financial targets Neles merger completed Research and development Supply chain Quality Sustainability ContactsResearch and development Innovation, cooperation and technology leadership for a carbon neutral future.

Valmet's supply chain directly contributes to the company's profitability, competitiveness, sustainability and overall delivery efficiency. The aim is to have a world-class supply chain operation that delivers sustainable and competitive results through close collaboration with suppliers. Valmet has over 30,000 active suppliers in around 60 countries, and spends over EUR 3 billion in direct and indirect purchases annually. Valmet's procurement, logistics and warehouse workforce totals 1,200 employees globally, located in five continents in more than 25 countries. Reorganizing for higher efficiency In 2022, the Procurement function was renamed Supply Chain and given responsibility for leading and developing both procurement and logistics. While Supply Chain teams remain distributed throughout our business lines and areas, some consolidation was carried out to optimize and centralize global tasks such as indirect sourcing and category management. The reorganization has led to the creation of a team which will focus on leveraging Valmet's purchasing power across business lines. The aim is to create supply contracts that serve multiple business lines with the best price and quality, consolidating contracts for better procurement performance. Valmet's new Flow Control business line was also successfully integrated into the new Supply Chain organization. The integrated team and common development plans allowed Valmet to identify savings opportunities in annual procurement spend. valmet | annual review 2022 || strategy | supply chain36 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Valmet's Way Forward Progress of Must-Win actions Financial targets Neles merger completed Research and development Supply chain Quality Sustainability ContactsExcellent performance in extraordinary times Most of 2022 was marked by uncertainty and extreme inflation. Driving the inflation were a faster-than-expected recovery after the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic was over and the outbreak of war in Ukraine, which reduced the availability of many raw materials worldwide, particularly in Europe. Compounding the problems was the continued unreliability of supply chains. Late vessels and congested ports slowed deliveries all over the world. Despite many countries seeing inflation of 10 percent or more for the year, many of our procurement performance indicators developed favorably during 2022. Procurement savings in 2022 were on a par with 2021, which was a better outcome than expected given cost inflation.Supply chain highlights in 2022 New Supply Chain organization established, covering procurement and logistics High procurement savings despitechallenging cost and supply chainenvironment New engagement program to improvesupplier sustainabilityOngoing mitigation efforts for better resilience The mitigation efforts Valmet started in 2021 continued in 2022 with increased urgency. We are sourcing more from established suppliers in cost-competitive countries, as well as introducing new sourcing locations. Our aim is to further expand our sourcing network to increase our overall ability to react to and accommodate changes in supply and demand. Nearly 1,000 new suppliers were onboarded over the course of 2022. This represents improvements in both cost-competitive and local sourcing. Whenever possible, Valmet uses local sourcing, buying close to customers, to reduce delivery times and simplify logistics. Sustainability at the forefront Ensuring a sustainable supply chain remains a top priority for Valmet. During 2022, we completed 42 supplier sustainability audits. We also rolled out a new reporting tool that gives us a direct insight into the coverage of Valmet's Sustainable Supply Chain Policy over our total procurement spend. Coverage is currently over 80 percent, with targets set for 2023 and beyond. In 2022, as part of the Valmet Climate Program, we started onboarding suppliers to help them improve their sustainability and reduce CO 2 emissions. The new engagement program includes a sustainability e-learning course for suppliers, which is available in three languages. All Supply Chain teams worked actively in 2022 to prepare to ramp up activities according to our Climate Program in 2023. We aim to grow the engagement scope over the next years from dozens to hundreds of suppliers to reduce CO 2 emissions by 20 percent in our supply chain by 2030. read more: Climate Sustainable Supply ChainPURCHASES (10 LARGEST COUNTRIES) EUR MILLION 2022 Finland 1,225 China 438 Sweden 331 USA 306 Germany 155 Brazil 105 India 82 Poland 75 Canada 74 Italy 54 valmet | annual review 2022 ||strategy | supply chain37 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Valmet's Way Forward Progress of Must-Win actions Financial targets Neles merger completed Research and development Supply chain Quality Sustainability ContactsQuality Quality is a cornerstone of the Valmet culture and is fundamental to the success of our customers and our business. Valmet supplies customers with sustainable solutions based on high-quality technology, processes and services. Our quality function aims to strengthen customer satisfaction and loyalty through continuous improvement across the value chain. Focus on processes The quality governance model implemented in recent years has delivered the expected results, and quality progressed as planned during 2022. As part of the continuous improvement driven by our Global Management System (GMS), a key focus area was process development. The Valmet quality function has worked extensively this year on creating standardized, structured process documentation. The process documentation work included the unifying of certain area-specific practices into global processes and broadening the scope of fundamental global processes. Key quality processes, for global as well as business line and area operations, are now documented with established workflows for follow-up and improvement. For example, Valmet now has 18 global processes covering core quality practices, such as root cause analysis and supplier incident management. Improving quality metrics A key performance indicator is Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ), measured as a percentage of net sales. This indicator not only helps us determine the impact of quality on our business but makes quality more concrete and helps prioritize corrective actions. valmet | annual review 2022 || strategy | quality38 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Valmet's Way Forward Progress of Must-Win actions Financial targets Neles merger completed Research and development Supply chain Quality Sustainability ContactsWhile COPQ is very important, Valmet monitors many other quality metrics such as the Continuous Improvement incident completion rate. To make these metrics more transparent and easier to use, Valmet started redefining several indicators in 2022. In addition, we kicked off a development project to build a quality dashboard. The quality dashboard will give Valmet a clear overview of all key performance indicators. It will also provide a centralized system for finding quality-related metrics quickly. This definition work and dashboard development will continue into the next year. Enhancing Valmet's culture of quality Valmet's culture of quality is reinforced by timely and impactful communication. Our work to raise awareness and instill a sense of personal ownership of quality into every Valmet employee began some years ago and continued in 2022, with much of the quality communications responsibilities now driven by the business lines and areas. Along with the transfer of responsibilities, quality communications were ramped up across the organization. Bulletins, weekly quality letters, videos, success stories and more are produced by teams around the world to boost our quality culture. Special activities were organized around key events such as the introduction of new processes.In addition to communications, we started to renew our quality training in 2022. After a thorough review of the needs across the organization, Valmet developed an entirely new quality training portfolio. This was done in parallel with creating formal definitions of quality competences and skills. Flow Control integration proceeds ahead of schedule Valmet's quality organization prepared well for the Neles merger and the integration of the new Flow Control business line. Quality integration plans were ready as soon as the merger was finalized, allowing prompt action. The Flow Control business line successfully followed and even exceeded the integration targets for 2022. Valmet's quality governance model was fully adopted, as well as the use of Valmet's continuous improvement tool, Spotlight. Flow Control employees benefited from the 2022 launch of our new quality training portfolio and successfully completed the courses. Key quality metrics, including COPQ, were also positive for the year. For 2023, integration plans include rolling out Valmet processes and moving the Flow Control quality and HSE ISO certifications into the Valmet global multisite certificate. read more: Certified operationsQuality highlights in 2022 Global quality processes mapped and documented Advanced quality mindset in continuous improvement and problem solving Global quality tools implementation to support quality performance valmet | annual review 2022 || strategy | quality39 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Valmet's Way Forward Progress of Must-Win actions Financial targets Neles merger completed Research and development Supply chain Quality Sustainability ContactsSustainability valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability40 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsSustainability360\u00b0 agenda Sustainability is fully integrated into Valmet's strategy and operations through the comprehensive Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda. In 2022, we renewed the agenda to highlight the impact of Valmet's sustainability work in the entire value chain. Valmet's guiding principles, transparent reporting and the comprehensive Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda create a solid foundation for sustainable business operations. Sustainability is an integral part of our strategy and related Must-Wins that provide structure and focus for our strategic initiatives, decisions and performance indicators. Our Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda has nine focus areas with systematic target setting, annual action plans and monitoring of progress. The agenda is aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement's 1.5-degree pathway and Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. A systematic, company-wide renewal effort In 2022, as part of continuous development, Valmet renewed its Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda, which has been the backbone for building the company's acknowledged sustainability work over the years. The renewed agenda includes environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects for sustainability and covers Valmet's entire value chain, including the supply chain, Valmet's own operations, and the use phase of Valmet's technologies. The agenda renewal process included an extensive analysis of the business environment, benchmarks and peer reviews, industry and corporate sustainability trends, future regulatory requirements, and stakeholder expectations. Based on the results, we defined nine ESG focus areas for the Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda and updated the main material sustainability topics for our value chain. Valmet's Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda's main material topics under the Environmental focus area are Circularity, Climate and Environmental efficiency. The main material topics under the Social focus area are Engaged workplace, Health and safety and Corporate citizenship. The main material topics under the Governance focus area are Ethical business practices, Sustainable supply chain and Transparent reporting.

Improving water efficiency and decreasing water consumption are also part of Valmet's environ mental targets for its own operations by 2030. Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy Valmet's energy solutions are based on biomass, waste or a mixture of different fuels. Valmet impacts this goal through energy technologies, e.g. by enabling heat and power production in biomass, waste and multifuel boilers, increasing the use of different fuel mixes, and air emission control systems for pulp mill and power plant flue gases. Valmet is also contributing to this goal by replacing fossil fuels with renewables, purchasing CO2-free electricity, and improving energy efficiency in its own operations.Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth Valmet's goal is zero harm to people and the environment. Valmet aims for a positive, safe, and fair working environment, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. We have a human rights management process for our own operations and the supply chain, e.g. to ensure human rights and protect labor rights. Valmet contributes to global economic productivity through investments in R&D, manufacturing high value-adding and resource-efficient technology, and fostering innovation. Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production Valmet develops process technologies, automation, and services to enable replacement of fossil materials with renewables and to support customers in producing high-value end products.

Valmet's technologies are designed for maximum resource and raw material efficiency, enabling the circular economy. Lightweight technologies that reduce fiber in board production, hybrid technologies that save fiber in tissue production, high-yield chemical pulp cooking, and fiberlines and power boilers that use residues impact this goal by significantly increasing the efficient use of resources. Valmet has a waste management target for its own operations by 2030. Valmet's sustainable supply chain management also contributes to this goal.Goal 13: Climate action Valmet has validated science-based CO2 emissions reduction targets and concrete actions for the whole value chain. Valmet contributes to this goal by offering bioenergy self-sufficient chemical pulp mills and enabling carbon neutral biomass-based heat and power production. By 2030, our target is to enable 100 percent carbon neutral production for customers. In addition, our target is to reduce CO2 emissions by 80 percent in our own operations and 20 percent in our supply chain by 2030. Valmet has also analyzed the potential long-term climate-related physical and transitional risks and their financial impact on its operations and business environment with different climate scenarios to support strategy and the capability of adapting to and mitigating climate change.Valmet supports the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We have identified the SDGs on which Valmet can have the most positive impact, or where we aim to minimize our negative impact. Our Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda and related targets have been aligned with selected SDGs. valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability | sustainability360\u00b0 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsProgress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda MATERIAL TOPIC TARGET KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATOR 2022 (2021) PROGRESS DESCRIPTION RELEVANT SDGS Environment Circularity, Climate and Environmental efficiency20 percent reduction of CO 2 emissions from supply chain by 20301CO 2 emissions from purchased goods and services (Scope 3 category 1), 1,000 tCO 2e2,237 (1,656) In 2022, Valmet's supply chain emissions increased due to organic company growth and the Neles merger. 80 percent reduction of CO 2 emissions from own operations by 20301% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 (market-based) CO 2 emissions, 1,000 tCO 2e-16 (-3) In 2022, Valmet continued to increase purchases of low-carbon electricity and energy efficiency actions and to promote low-carbon commuting and business travel. 75 percent waste from own operations diverted from disposal by 20301% waste diverted from disposal 65 (64) Waste reduction actions continued in locations, with the focus in 2022 on implementing targets and plans in recently acquired and merged operations. 20 percent reduction in water consumption from own operations by 20301% water consumption change +11 (+3) Water consumption reduction actions continued in locations, with the focus in 2022 on implementing targets and plans in recently acquired and merged operations.

The fundamental idea of circularity is embedded in our mission: Converting renewable resources into sustainable results. Circularity is an integral part of Valmet's solutions for pulp, paper and energy production. For several decades, Valmet has systematically developed circularity through its process technology, automation and services, in its own operations, and the supply chain. We play a key role in enabling our customers to apply a circular economy to their operations. In 2022, we carried out several initiatives to reduce waste, improve recycling and close process cycles. Supporting and integrating suppliers Valmet enables circularity in its supply chain, its own operations and during the use phase of its solutions. Applying circularity criteria starts from the product design and drawings, where weight reduction and the increase of alternative raw materials are utilized. Circularity has been embedded into our Sustainable Supply Chain policy requirements, which sets the basis for Valmet's Supplier Sustainability engagement program. Through environmental management requirements, we support and urge our suppliers to reduce their environmental impacts and reuse and increase the share of recycled materials in their operations. We have also included circularity as a topic in the e-learning course, which was developed specifically for suppliers and was launched in 2022. Circular economy in everyday operations In our own operations, we are constantly improving our processes by increasing resource efficiency, with the aim of maximizing the use of renewable and recycled raw materials in our technology offering by closing cycles in production processes, cascading the use of production sidestreams and reducing waste. An important part of the circularity work at Valmet is our take back, exchange and reconditioning programs. Our global network of workshop services recondition everyday rolls, feeders, shafts and screens, extending the lifecycle for our customers. We also have exchange programs, for example, where winder units are rebuilt and upgraded. In addition, about 1,300 tonnes of refiner segments and 3,000 winder slitters are taken back for recycling each year. We are exploring extending the take back offering to other products. All Valmet foundries have targets for the use of recycled metal. In 2022, the share of recycled steel and iron in Valmet's foundries was 68 percent. We are also exploring the increased use of recycled polymers in fabrics production. Developing new innovations to speed up the green transition All wood raw material and production sidestreams are utilized at Mets\u00e4 Group's \u00c4\u00e4nekoski mill in Finland. valmet | annual || sustainability | environmental45 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsDuring the year, we also continued the cascading of fabrics production sidestreams for reuse in other industries. For example, production scraps are now used as raw material in shoe production, bag making and furniture parts, as well as new felt raw materials. During the first ever Fabrics Climate Week, Valmeteers generated a further 100 ideas to further develop circularity in our operations. All our operations work to increase waste recycling and reuse. For example, 10,600 tonnes of foundry sand are reused by partners in road construction and land stabilization, and the wood waste of our Helsinki plant is reused to make chipboard for furniture. Our operations in Spain continued to develop their safety glove reuse program with the aim of reducing glove waste by 80 percent. We are also working to increase the use of renewable materials in the packaging of our products. Circular economy is fundamental to Valmet's mission With our solutions, customers can use and recover energy, water and chemicals more efficiently or minimize waste by using production sidestreams from other applications, processes or even industries. Our energy technologies enable the conversion of waste to energy, and our comprehensive services and automation help customers utilize these technologies for decades. Valmet is also playing a strong role in the textile industry revolution and sees novel cellulose-based textiles and fiber-to- fiber textile recycling as the solution for more sustainable and circular textile production. Valmet delivered key technology for refining, washing, bleaching and drying to Renewcell's new textile recycling plant in Sundsvall, Sweden. It is the first commercial- scale fiber-to-fiber textile recycling plant of its kind in the world and was started up this year. Furthermore, Valmet has focused on commercializing new biomass conversion technologies such as lignin extraction technology for replacing fossil chemicals and pyrolysis for liquid biofuel solutions. For instance, a LignoBoost XSTM plant will be delivered to Mercer Rosenthal Lignin Center in Germany, where the extracted lignin will be used to develop various bio-based materials that can replace fossil raw materials. The joint venture between Valmet and Mets\u00e4 Group's innovation company Mets\u00e4 Spring creates sustainable solutions for the world's packaging needs. The novel molded fiber products are manufactured from wood fiber from northern woods and are a great option for replacing plastic. Since the demand for molded fiber products is growing fast, this new technology offers Valmet a great opportunity to enter a new market with its molded fiber technology, Valmet 3D Fiber. In 2022, Valmet launched Beyond Circularity, a new R&D and innovation program. Through this program, we will enhance our readiness to support the green transition in customer industries based on Valmet's technology vision 2030. The program will further strengthen our R&D work to develop process technologies, automation and services that utilize renewable materials, as well as recycled waste and sidestreams. read more: Supplier sustainability engagement program valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability | environmental46 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsENVIRONMENTAL Climate Valmet believes that technology plays a key role in mitigating climate change and global warming and wants to enable the green transition to carbon neutral operations for its customers. During 2022, we progressed systematically in the implementation of our Climate Program, covering our supply chain, our own operations and the use phase of our technologies and services. Climate change and global warming are significant challenges that are driving companies to rapidly transform and reduce their carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. In 2021, Valmet launched an ambitious climate program Forward to a Carbon Neutral Future - with concrete targets for the whole value chain to address these challenges. Using 2019 as the baseline, the program aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 80 percent in our own operations and by 20 percent in the supply chain by 2030. For the use phase of Valmet's technologies, we will be able to provide fully carbon neutral pulp and paper solutions to our customers by 2030 at the latest, while continuing to improve the efficiency of the current technologies. Valmet already provides customers today with pulp and energy solutions that enable fully carbon neutral energy production by using biomass. In 2022, we continued to enhance supplier collaboration and engagement, transform our own operations and develop technologies enabling carbon neutral production for customers. Valmet will achieve the program targets, approved by the Science Based Targets initiative, without emission compensation. The efforts are aligned with the Paris Climate Agreement 1.5-degree pathway and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Good progress in the first full year of program The climate program has been well received by Valmet's stakeholders and is progressing on schedule. During 2022 - the first full year of the program - detailed roadmaps were created, and the implementation continued. The program is an integral part of Valmet's Sustainability360\u00ba agenda, and is thus included in the company's strategy and related annual planning. In 2022, Valmet launched a comprehensive e-learning course to give its employees insights into climate change and the circular economy. The e-learning course covers the impacts on our business environment and the actions we are taking with our suppliers and customers to decarbonize the operations. Enhanced supplier collaboration to reduce emissions We have defined several actions in Valmet's supply chain to reach the emissions reduction targets set, such as increasing the share of recycled steel in Valmet's products. In 2022, we mapped the level of recycled steel and iron used at all our foundries globally. In 2022, the share of recycled steel and iron increased by six percent to 68 percent. Transportation emissions were also reduced by using more rail transportation than air and ocean freight, for example. In 2022, the number and weight of our air shipments decreased by 12 percent. This year we also continued to identify the highest emitting suppliers among our supplier base and started to engage them valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability | environmental47 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance Contactsin a new CO2 emissions reduction effort as part of our existing Supplier Sustainability engagement program. The engagement program also includes a climate change e-learning course, created specifically for suppliers, and global supplier sustainability innovation initiatives. Continued transformation of our own operations Valmet is driving quickly toward a low-carbon future by replacing fossil fuels, purchasing CO2-free electricity and district heating, and investing in energy efficiency improvements. We are continuing to extend the use of digital tools and further develop remote ways of working that reduce business travel emissions. In 2022, a change to carbon neutral fuels was started at selected Valmet locations. Multiple energy efficiency investment projects such as LED lighting upgrades, compressed air improvements and installation of heat recovery systems were also implemented. Energy audits to find future action areas were performed in workshops in Poland, India and Indonesia. To promote sustainable commuting, Valmet enables electric vehicle charging for employees, with new guidance for charging stations at our locations. The company also participates in various energy-saving initiatives such as the nationwide Down a degree campaign in Finland, targeting concrete energy-saving actions. We continue to support the installation of solar panels in our facilities - most recently, in Brazil. We have already reached 20 percent CO2-free electricity consumption at Valmet locations in 2022, thanks to CO2-free electricity contracts and guarantee of origin certificates. Carbon neutral processes for customers Most of the carbon footprint of our value chain comes from the use phase of our technologies. Most chemical pulp mills provided by Valmet today are already self-sufficient in energy. Furthermore, we enable carbon neutral heat and power production with our current biomass energy solutions, and are working on developing energy source options beyond biomass. Full scope offering for CO2 emissions reduction \"Technology will play a crucial role in the transition to carbon neutrality,\" says Janne Pynn\u00f6nen, Vice President of R&D. In 2022, we continued to enhance supplier collaboration and engagement, transform our own operations and develop technologies enabling carbon neutral production for customers.In 2022, we identified the remaining process technologies in our offering that still use fossil fuels and created plans to change them to electricity or renewables. We also promoted our climate offering in process technologies, automation and services to reduce CO2 emissions and other environmental impacts. read more: Climate training Climate offering valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability | environmental48 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsUSE PHASE OF VALMET'S TECHNOLOGIES Existing process technologies that still use fossil fuels have been identified, and plans for how to change them to electricity or renewables have been defined Target to increase energy efficiency is fully integrated in all R&D projects Valmet's offering for process technologies, automation and services to reduce CO2 emissions and other environmental impacts has been launchedSUPPLY CHAIN -20% CO2 emission reduction1 MAIN ACTIONS Actions to reduce emissions in direct purchasing and logistics include increased share of recycled steel in products supporting high CO2 intensive suppliers in reducing emissions redesigning lightweight steel products, introducing alternative raw materials and optimizing component manufacturing methods centralizing spend to selected suppliers offering low carbon transportation continuing to develop freight planning SUPPLY CHAIN The level of recycled steel and iron has been mapped at Valmet's foundries.

ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsWe actively enhance environmental efficiency in our value chain: We do more with less. To minimize environmental impacts in our supply chain, we have a global supplier sustainability management process and engagement program. For our own operations, the Environmental Program was updated in 2022 to accelerate efficiency gains. To improve efficiency during the use phase of our technology at customers' operations, Valmet has technology vision 2030, R&D processes and guidelines in place. According to an estimate, a four percent environmental impact arises from our supply chain when we purchase manufactured goods and services from our suppliers and transport them to Valmet's sites, while less than one percent arises from our own operations. Most of the environmental impact, around 95 percent of Valmet's value chain impact, is created when our customers are using our process technologies during the product's lifetime. Environmental efficiency is part of Valmet's sustainable supply chain management process. To learn more about our sustainability work with suppliers, please check out the Sustainable supply chain on page 63 and Climate on page 47.Environmental program speeding up progress in Valmet's own operations To manage and improve environmental efficiency in our own operations, we have had an environmental program in place since 2009, with ambitious targets for reducing energy, water, and waste. In 2022, we updated the targets and baselines of the program to 2030. To support the cascading of the global program into local actions, we aim for 80 percent of our employees to be working in locations certified to the ISO 14001:2015 environmental management system by 2025. We are on track, and during 2022, we certified 10 more locations to the environmental standard, increasing the total number to 80 and the coverage to 78 (76) percent of employees. We continually invest in environmental improvements in our facilities. This year, many actions were related to energy efficiency such as LED lighting upgrades, the installation of motion sensors, improving building insulation and new ventilation systems. Several of our Finnish units also participated in the national Down a degree energy-saving campaign, with actions such as fixing compressed air leaks and reducing room temperatures. We also included environmental efficiency requirements in our real estate guidelines for new facilities and renovations and created good practice guidance during the year. Environmental efficiency plays a key role in the innovation process Customer needs and global megatrends such as pursuing a more resource-efficient and cleaner world drive our R&D work. Valmet's process technology, automation and services are designed to improve raw material, energy, water and chemical efficiency and reduce emissions.ENVIRONMENTAL Environmental efficiency valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability | environmental50 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance Contacts1 Valmet merged with Neles on April 1, 2022.

The company also offered virtual resilience workshops to interested Valmeteers. Work-life integration is an area where local influence is often the strongest and most impactful, thus creating a need for locally driven practices. For example, a Viva a Vida 'Enjoy Life' program covering psychological orientation, anxiety, stress and financial planning was offered in South America, an on-site yoga series was offered in India in conjunction with international yoga day and an extra holiday was added to the U.S. holiday calendar. Meanwhile, the team in Finland managed to utilize 87 percent of the ePassi wellness benefit. Sustainability e-learning grows knowledge In 2022, a new Climate e-learning course was launched, increasing employees' understanding of climate change and the circular economy. >40 COUNTRIESAttracting talent Effective resourcing and talent attraction activities continued to be important in 2022. Business growth, workforce aging, an active job market and high internal mobility challenged us to look for new ways to attract talent, widen our candidate pool and promote ourselves as an attractive employer. In 2022, we successfully hired more than 1,990 new employees and filled 39 percent of positions with internal candidates. As part of our efforts to widen our recruitment pool, we have increased cooperation with universities and developed new trainee programs for students and recent graduates. In Brazil, we launched a new FirstStepForward trainee program and continued with our international graduate program for tissue professionals and our summer trainee program in Finland. Plans are also underway for multiple new trainee programs in 2023, for example, for project management and industrial software development. We are also in the process of expanding our recruitment referral programs to new countries. Strengthening our employer image continues to be a key priority for us. In 2022, Valmet received recognition as an attractive employer in several core markets, including Finland. We are also actively working to raise our profile in lesser-known markets to ensure we continue to get the best talent to join our winning team, now and in the future. valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability | social55 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsSOCIAL Health and safety We believe a safety-first mindset paired with a commitment to robust standards is critical to ensuring that everyone returns home healthy and safe at the end of every day. In 2022, we worked to develop injury prevention, contractor and site safety, and our safety culture. Valmet is committed to protecting the health and safety of its people, customers, partners, and the communities where we operate. We protect people by investing in a positive safety culture, collaborating with customers and partners, and constantly improving our safety-related processes and practices. Valmet's overall focus on health and safety continued throughout 2022, and our Total Recordable Incident Frequency (TRIF) for external workers was at its lowest ever at 4.7 (6.8). For our own employees it remained at 3.2 (3.1). We significantly increased the number of walks, inspections and conversations promoting health and safety to four per manager. However, there is more to do. Regrettably, in January, a fatal contractor injury occurred during installation work at Valmet's customer site in Sweden, and in December, a contractor passed away after an incident during flow control product testing in Valmet's factory in Ambernath, India. Immediately after both incidents, Valmet initiated investigations in cooperation with the authorities and other stakeholders. Corrective actions and improvements have been taken, and lessons learned shared globally. In May 2022, a fire broke out at Valmet's Rautpohja factory in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland. While material damage could not be avoided, our evacuation routines worked as drilled, and no one was seriously injured, despite the risk the fire posed. In response, Valmet conducted systematic fire safety checks at all other facilities worldwide. Campaigns for hands and working at heights Valmet safety campaigns are rooted in the firm belief that all incidents can be prevented, and our goal of zero harm is achievable. Over the course of 2022, Valmet's injury prevention campaigns centered on hand safety and working at heights. Since about 40 percent of all injuries to our people and partners involve hands, in February, we started to raise awareness of the hand injury risks many Valmeteers face. The campaign included tool inspections, holding seminars about Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), as well as sharing information about hand safety. Our second major campaign of the year addressed working at heights. A primary campaign focus was to promote the proper use of safety harnesses. We also emphasized the responsibility of managers in assessing and executing such work safely, as well as the key role employees play in identifying and suggesting improvements in our ways of working. Contractor and site safety Engaging our partners in health and safety dialogue and development is a critical element of our safety management approach. Every year, we hold several Contractor health, safety and environment (HSE) days, during which we align safety commitments and expectations with our main site suppliers. These events are highly appreciated by our partners, and in 2022, we continued the effort in Brazil, China, Finland, India and Sweden. valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability | social56 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsWe also help our partners through our contractor safety program. The program is an end-to-end effort to improve safety in all contract relations. We train contractors about rules and expectations, and during the year, we developed a training on HSE for site supervisors, which will also be launched for contractor supervisors. As part of our continuous improvement efforts, we updated Valmet's minimum safety standards in 2022. The Valmet minimum safety standards cover 15 high-risk activities and are available in 17 languages. Embedding safety into workplace culture Through standards, processes, and routines, we can systematically control and improve health and safety. To achieve our goal of zero harm, however, we need to have a safety-first mindset. This comes from nurturing a culture of safety at the workplace. To support our safety culture, a key focus during 2022 was to increase HSE communications and awareness through team- based toolbox talk practices, as well as info calls and newsletters on topical issues.

During this week, global online events and local in-person activities are held. Local activities range from simple stretching and strength exercise sessions to organizing special safety clinics, wellbeing seminars and campaigns. In 2022, we started piloting our new HSE Ambassador Program in Valmet's Pulp and Energy business line, offering opportunities for people interested in health and safety to promote our safety culture in day-to-day activities. Global health and safety process development Health and safety are an essential element of the Valmet product offering. In 2022, we invested in product safety development and established a cross-functional team to develop training, share best practices and improve tools. Our approach for product and process safety management covers all phases from research and development to lifecycle services after the project delivery. In 2022, we continued to define and develop global health and safety processes, which are included in the Valmet Handbook for all Valmeteers. We also continued to work on aligning and integrating operations that Valmet has acquired into our HSE processes and global management system. Good practices from South America Valmet's team in South America has systematically developed a strong safety culture and fact-driven improvements that support site safety. valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability | social57 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsSOCIAL Corporate citizenship With operations in over 40 countries and a global network of partners and stakeholders, Valmet carries significant responsibility as a corporate citizen. In 2022, we launched a renewed social responsibility program, while continuing our strong support for research and education and engaging with local communities. As a global company and a recognized sustainability leader in our industry, we work in a multicultural business environment, where companies may have a range of potential social impacts. Our growing presence in emerging markets emphasizes our responsibility toward local communities. Our corporate citizenship efforts aim to build awareness of Valmet as a positive contributor to the societies where we operate. With global operations, we directly provide employment and business opportunities and indirectly build wellbeing in local communities.Renewed focus on local needs and actions In 2022, Valmet renewed its Social Responsibility Program with the target of building local programs linked to key themes. Based on a systematic selection process involving Valmet employees, several local projects were started at the end of the year, covering all the geographical areas in which Valmet operates. The renewed program aims to increase the local impact of donated funds, enhance Valmet's visibility in communities, and open up more opportunities for local Valmeteers to engage in local program activities. In March 2022, Valmet donated EUR 50,000 to UNICEF Finland to help children and their families affected by the war in Ukraine. The plight of Ukrainians also sparked a Valmeteer to kick off an employee fundraiser for the Finnish Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund to help the victims of the war. By the end of the fundraising period in July 2022, employees had donated over EUR 26,000. In recognition of the employee-driven effort, Valmet donated EUR 25,000 to the Finnish Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund in April 2022. Partnering with universities to drive development Valmet has a long history of mutual cooperation with universities, for example, in the fields of engineering and mathematics. Valmet's research and development work is complemented by a network of world-leading research facilities and universities. In recent years, that cooperation has intensified, with several Valmet employees completing their doctoral research as a part of their work and personal development.

For instance, a EUR 50,000 donation to the University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 in Finland was announced in July. The donation supports the important work that the university is doing for science and education. We also continue our summer trainee program in Finland and Sweden. In 2022, Valmet had nearly 500 trainees working in its locations around Finland alone. The training period gives students valuable work experience, but it is also valuable for Valmet. The students bring fresh ideas and the latest information with them, contributing to Valmet's aim of continuous improvement and renewal. Valmet expands its global Social Responsibility Program with new local projects The Social Responsibility Program is part of Valmet's sustainability agenda implementation. valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability | social59 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsGovernance We follow ethical business practices, ensure a sustainable supply chain and report transparently.

The campaign emphasized the importance of reporting concerns and raised awareness of reporting channels, particularly our external reporting channel, TrustLine. The portal, operated by a third party to guarantee anonymity, is open 24/7 and can be reached via the internet or telephone in the reporter's native language. Valmet runs a global Privacy Program based on European Data Protection Principles. Local adaptation of global procedures has been one of the focus areas in 2022. We have e-learning courses on the Valmet Code, Anti-Bribery and Corruption, Competition Law Compliance and Data Privacy. By the end of 2022, 87 percent of 17,548 employees have completed the current mandatory Code of Conduct e-learning course. Social impact of ethical business Valmet is committed to the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and we express our engagement in our Human Rights Statement. We have a comprehensive due diligence framework to monitor and manage social impacts related to our own operations and our supply chain. The due diligence framework includes social impact assessments and their findings, action plan creation and monitoring progress. We have a location-specific social impact assessment process, targeting the assessment of social impacts in our operations to ensure our social policies and procedures are effective and adequate. In late 2022, we conducted a social impact assessment in India.We strive to ensure that all operations are carried out in a socially responsible manner. In 2022, we revised our Ethics and Compliance Program, refined our list of salient human rights issues, strengthened sustainability management and expanded operational certifications. We strive for globally consistent and transparent management practices so that all our stakeholders can reliably assess the sustainability of our operations and development. Valmet also supports and promotes selected international guidelines and principles and is a signatory of the UN Global Compact. Code of Conduct Valmet's Code of Conduct guides the actions and decisions of Valmet's employees and its partners. The code sets the standards of responsible behavior and creates a uniform foundation for ethical business transactions and work assignments. Our Code of Conduct applies to everyone, everywhere, every day. To reinforce this message, Valmet launched a revised Ethics and Compliance Program in 2022. The program focuses on ensuring that all employees understand that everyone is responsible for ensuring that Valmet does business ethically and legally. This starts with ethical leadership and leading by example. In 2022, we also prepared for the EU Whistleblowing Directive to ensure we are compliant as local legislation comes into force. We defined and facilitated a restructured organization for handling reported misconduct throughout the company. Corporate and Area Compliance Committees were created to valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability | governance61 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsIn 2022, we evaluated our social impact due diligence framework to ensure full alignment with the United Nations' Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We redefined our salient human rights issues as part of continuous renewal and development. The updated list of salient issues includes 14 UN human rights. Valmet's human rights due diligence framework can now focus exclusively on these salient issues. Our due diligence process remains as before, with four distinct phases: collecting information about social impacts; identifying actual or potential impacts; analyzing findings for corrective actions; and implementing and reporting on these actions. Certified operations equal well-managed business Valmet's Global Management System (GMS) provides a common platform for quality and HSE management in all operations. Through the annual planning process, targets and improvement initiatives are aligned across all units and locations to drive development toward our strategic objectives. By taking best practice into common global practice, we are able to continually improve. We believe that multisite certification of our operations assures our customers and other stakeholders that we have a process- oriented and standardized global way of working according to the international ISO standards for quality (9001:2015), environment (14001:2015), and health and safety (ISO 45001:2018) management systems. Our target is that at least 80 percent of our people will work in operations certified to all three standards by 2025. We made significant progress toward that 80 percent goal during 2022, as 11 locations were added with new or expanded certifications. Altogether, 37 Valmet locations were audited by an external auditor during the year. Strengthened sustainability management Valmet has strengthened sustainability-related governance to increase dialogue with Valmet's functions, business lines and areas. With its renewed Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda, Valmet significantly strengthened sustainability related governance. We created a broader and more detailed formulation of our sustainability governance framework, explicitly defining teams, meeting purposes, schedules and agendas. With stronger sustainability management, Valmet aims to deepen the systematic and impactful dialogue across all business lines and areas. The larger communication framework with a greater degree of formality will help ensure our sustainability efforts remain focused on Valmet's material topics with progress checks and regular support for annual sustainability planning.

During 2022, we updated Valmet's Sustainable Supply Chain Policy and supplier sustainability risk assessment, launched a climate-related e-learning course for our suppliers and continued our supplier engagement. Valmet's Supply Chain aims to be a world-class operation that delivers sustainable and competitive results through close collaboration with suppliers. As many production phases of Valmet are handled by its suppliers, it has an extensive supplier network today, with over 30,000 active suppliers in nearly 60 countries. Global supply chains are complex and challenging to monitor. Valmet has systematically developed and integrated sustainability into its supply chain processes. We engage our suppliers to continuously develop their sustainability performance to ensure transparent and sustainable operations. Valmet's suppliers have different sustainability risk levels, derived from the supplier's country of origin or purchasing category. For identifying, assessing, and managing various sustainability risks, Valmet has a global four-step supplier sustainability management process. Valmet's Sustainable Supply Chain Policy sets the basic themes and requirements for all steps in the process, covering business ethics and compliance, human and labor rights, occupational health and safety, climate and environmental management, and sustainable products and services. Valmet's supplier sustainability management process is an integral part of the supplier approval process. It includes gates and controls to ensure Valmet cooperates only with suppliers that share the same ethical principles and ideology of responsible business practices. The supplier evaluation process is mandatory in evaluating new suppliers before starting cooperation. Updated policy requirements and enhanced sustainability risk assessments Our Sustainable Supply Chain Policy has been in place since 2014. In 2022, we updated the policy with new legal compliance requirements related to export control, trade sanction laws and regulations. We also strengthened our requirements related to climate, products and services. We expect suppliers to monitor, report, and strive to reduce the CO2 emissions of their operations and their own value chain. In addition, suppliers must continually reduce hazardous substances in their products and ensure conflict-free sourcing. All suppliers are evaluated through a sustainability risk assessment based on the country of purchase and the purchasing category. The risk assessment is the second step of our supplier sustainability management process, aiming to assess the potential negative impacts and risks. The outcome determines the actions needed in the remaining steps of the process: self-assessment; and sustainability auditing. In 2022, Valmet updated both country and purchasing category risk levels. Ensuring compliance with Valmet's requirements through auditing To ensure compliance with the requirements of our Sustainable Supply Chain Policy and with related local and international laws, we have a systematic auditing framework in place. Valmet has conducted supplier sustainability audits globally every year since 2015. In 2022, we conducted 45 supplier sustainability audits in 14 countries with a certified third-party auditor. valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability | governance63 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsWe also continued to focus on ensuring the right timing and good quality of the audit follow-up process and the verification of agreed corrective actions. The findings of these audits were mainly related to human and labor rights, and health and safety. Of all corrective actions agreed with suppliers in 2022, 47 percent had been completed and verified by the end of the year. Since 2015, 90 percent of all actions agreed with suppliers as part of the auditing process had been completed and verified by the end of 2022. Valmet has identified increased sustainability risks at customers' sites, where many of our contractors and their subcontractors operate. We have developed a specific auditing process for site works suppliers to mitigate risks at sites, monitor subcontractors' compliance more efficiently and to further increase the visibility to our supply chain beyond tier 1 suppliers. In 2022, we piloted the process at customer sites in Sweden and Finland. Supplier sustainability engagement reinforced To further strengthen the cooperation with suppliers in the field of sustainability, Valmet has implemented a Sustainability Engagement Program since 2018. The program supports and monitors suppliers' performance and provides hands-on concrete tools and training for them to take the most critical steps to develop their sustainability practices. The program is based on the principles of Valmet's Sustainable Supply Chain Policy, and it is an integral part of our Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) program. SRM is used to evaluate, manage and improve suppliers' sustainability in a globally aligned manner. The program includes internal training and a virtual supplier sustainability day for the participating suppliers to introduce the importance of sustainability at Valmet, identify collaboration areas and share best practices. The aim is to increase awareness and give practical advice on how to develop more sustainable business operations. Since the launch of Valmet's Climate Program in 2021, we have been developing our Supplier Engagement Program further to cover climate related topics more fully. During 2022, selected suppliers from China and EMEA with the most CO2-intensive operations were invited to join the new engagement program. By working together based on open dialogue about the impacts of climate change, we can reduce the emissions in the supply chain and meet the growing market expectations for carbon neutral products and services and reach the supply chain's CO2 reduction target of 20 percent by 2030. We also aim to increase data quality for more precise and transparent sustainability reports by introducing supplier- specific emissions reporting for these selected suppliers. Our suppliers not only benefit from Valmet's experience in sustainable operations, but they are able to achieve operational cost savings through lower emissions and better energy efficiency, improving business performance and contributing to customer satisfaction and trust. All Valmet suppliers are provided access to a competence- building library with concrete development tools, several e-learning courses, and practical handbooks. We aim to increase awareness and give practical advice on how to develop more sustainable business practices. In 2022, Valmet launched a new Climate e-learning course for suppliers to specifically address emissions, and how to reduce them.

In 2022, we further developed our reporting framework to prepare for future requirements regarding sustainability reporting. Valmet strives for globally consistent and transparent management and reporting practices and participates in several third-party sustainability ratings to help stakeholders assess its sustainability performance. We also actively collaborate with our stakeholders to share thoughts and communicate about our recent developments through numerous channels. Preparing for future reporting requirements The sustainability reporting landscape is rapidly changing. More reporting frameworks have been introduced, and stakeholders expect these new reporting requirements to be followed. Valmet has been reporting sustainability performance according to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards since 2014. Valmet is a committed participant of the UN Global Compact (UNGC) and its Ten Principles on human rights, labor, environment and anti-corruption. Since 2014, we have reported on our sustainability performance annually in line with the UNGC's Communication of Progress process. In 2018, we started to report selected sustainability indicators according to the EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD). Since 2020, we have reported climate-related information according to the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. In 2022, Valmet continued the climate scenario analysis of its operations and business environment with quantitative modeling of the most impactful climate-related risks and opportunities. Focusing on Valmet's largest geographical locations and key elements in the supply chain, the analysis provided a financial impact range for the climate-related risks and opportunities by 2030, based on the 1.5 \u00b0C and 4 \u00b0C scenarios. Valmet reported financial figures according to the EU's taxonomy regulation for the first time in 2021, and the work continued in 2022. To support current and future integrated reporting needs, we continued to develop internal reporting systems and started to assess external reporting tools in 2022. read more: Valmet's TCFD report EU taxonomy reporting continued In 2022, Valmet continued to develop its processes related to the EU taxonomy, a system for determining environmentally sustainable activities. valmet | annual review 2022 || sustainability | governance65 ANNUAL REVIEW 2022 Valmet in brief President and CEO's review This is Valmet Business reviews Strategy Sustainability Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Progress on Sustainability360\u00b0 agenda Environmental Social Governance ContactsSustainability Award Bronze Class 2022 Valmet recognized as a sustainability leader We report to several third-party sustainability rating organizations for independent evaluation of our sustainability efforts.
