Materials and Methods: Of 1750 chronic renal disease patients who were undergoing hemodialysis, only 450 patients attended in the study. Among 450 patients, 388 gave consent and were interviewed using a previously tested questionnaire. Questions about complementary and alternative medicine use, a list of commonly used methods, and the sources of knowledge about these were asked of all patients. Results: We observed a significant difference in the patients who were using complementary and alternative medicines before and after diagnosis of chronic renal disease (P < .001). We noted that 87% of the patients used complementary and alternative medicines before diagnosis and 49.8% used these after diagnosis. Among the patients who used complementary and alternative medicines, 76% had faith in these therapies. Of patients who used complementary and alternative medicines, 95% believed that the remedies or processes used were beneficial to their health. Furthermore, 71% of users had great confidence in these therapies and had no belief that these could be harmful. Of those who used complementary and alternative therapies, 51% had no idea whether these therapies were harmful. The source of knowledge was mass media tools (47%), social life (friends, relatives, neighbors, colleagues; 45%), and other patients with chronic renal disease (8%). Conclusions: Complementary and alternative medicine therapies have a significant impact on patients with chronic renal disease. Doctors can warn patients about possible dangers of complementary and alternative medicine remedies and treatments. Key words : Chronic renal disease, Complementary and alternative medicine, Hemodialysis Introduction End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a progressive chronic disease, and there is no cure. Medical technologies such as hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and renal transplant are prolonging lives; however, many patients still die from the disease. The adaptation of these patients to illness and accepting life changes with ESRD are not always straightforward. Chronic hemodialysis requires significant alterations in lifestyle, and there are many potential problems, which can be grouped as physiologic, psychosocial, and economic.1-4 During the early phases of hemodialysis, patients are especially vulnerable to anxiety, depression, and demoralization due to feelings of restriction emerging from hemodialysis treatment.1-9 Although religious beliefs could be an important factor in a patient's ability to cope, patients have been reported to try other various complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) throughout their illness and dialysis process.10-13 There are no clear and consistent definitions of alternative or complementary medicines. Because CAM practices involve many components, some definitions have been found to be incomplete, whereas others have been found to be unclear. In 1995, the Panel on Definition and Description announced the following definition at a National Institutes of Health research methodology conference: \"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a broad domain of resources that encompasses health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes such resources perceived by their users as associated with positive health outcomes. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and the domain of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed.\"14 Complementary and alternative medicines have been available for centuries. The Ebers papyrus, which was written in 1536 BC and accepted as the first textbook on medicine, has over 900 recipes for almost every health problem.15 Because of the lack of modern medical supplies, CAM applications were the only approaches to heal the sick. Until the 19th and 20th centuries, CAM applications were used by caregivers. With the technological developments of the Industrial Revolution, the instruments of the health caregivers have evolved and everything changed. First, cells were identified, then the germ theory was articulated, and, throughout the modernization process, plant extracts were taken to create modern medicine.16,17 During the past 2 decades, CAM use has increased to reach almost 80% in the world.18,19 Increased life expectancy have also increased the number of individuals with chronic diseases, which has increased CAM use. Although some herbal remedies result in organ deficiencies, users are unconvinced of potential dangers, perhaps as a result of mass media and the Internet.19-23 Today, natural and other alternative approaches that complement conventional medicine include dietary supplements, megadose vitamins, herbal preparations, fruit teas, acupuncture, massage therapy, magnet therapy, spiritual healing, and meditation. Patients with ESRD use CAM as a way out of hopelessness. Patients may use every possible means to find a miracle, but these may lead to complications. Understanding and caring for these complications can be a challenge to medical teams since they may not know what the patient is using. We conducted this study to gather information about CAM applications used by chronic renal failure patients and their relation to demographic factors. Materials and Methods All patients had ESRD and were receiving hemodialysis treatment. Data were collected from different cultural regions of Turkey. Hemodialysis patients at the Bakent University Ankara, Adana, Alanya, and skenderun Dialysis Centers (1700 total hemodialysis patients) were asked to participate in the study. Patients who were at least 18 years old and who verbally consented were included in the study. Among 1750 patients, 450 agreed to participate, with 388 of 450 patients giving their consent. The patients were interviewed by using a pretested questionnaire. The questionnaire included 21 questions with subsets that were clustered under 4 different subjects. The first subject group involved patient demographic characteristics. The second group included questions on CAM use (whether they were currently using CAM or had used CAM in the past before ESRD diagnosis; their perceptions of its efficacy, that is, whether CAM had worsened their condition, made no difference, helped somewhat, or helped substantially; and whether they used CAM occasionally or regularly). The third subject group included a list of commonly used methods (alternative medical systems, mind-body interventions, biologic-based therapies, manipulative and body-based methods, and energy therapies). The final subject group included questions regarding the patient's knowledge about CAM and the source of their knowledge. Results Of 388 hemodialysis patients included in the study, there were 204 men (52.6%) and 184 women (47.4%) with a mean age of 48.9 \u00b1 15.9 years (range, 18-85 years) ( [Table 1](javascript:void(0);)). Our results showed that 225 participants (58%) used at least one CAM application. Among these users, most had lower levels of education and believed that these applications were beneficial for their disease (P < .001). The socio-demographic characteristics of the 225 patients who used at least one type of CAM for their condition are shown in [Table 2](javascript:void(0);). As shown, there were no significant associations between CAM use versus sex and age. However, we did observe a significant correlation between use of CAM and level of education (P < .05). The geographical area of patients was also significantly associated with CAM use ( [Table 3](javascript:void(0);)). Patients who lived in Alanya and Iskenderun had the highest percentage of CAM use. There was a significant difference in CAM use before and after diagnosis ( [Figure 1](javascript:void(0);)). Before diagnosis, 87% of patients used CAM; however, after diagnosis, 49.8% started to use CAM (P < .001). Only 12.9% of patients did not use CAM before diagnosis, whereas 50.2% did not use CAM after diagnosis. Among patients who used CAM, 76% had faith in these therapies and 71% reported having a great level of confidence in these treatments that they disregarded that these could be harmful ( [Figure 2](javascript:void(0);)). In users of CAM therapies, 51% had no idea whether CAM was harmful. In addition, 95% also believed that CAM treatments were beneficial to their health. Complementary and alternative medicines can be divided into 3 groups: herbal remedies, religious-based applications, and other CAM therapies based on patient choices. As shown in [Table 4](javascript:void(0);), most patients used herbal mixtures (43.1%) among the herbal remedy group. These mixtures were followed by fruit teas (30.2%) and seed or fruit consumption (20%). Among religious-based CAM therapies ( [Table 5](javascript:void(0);)), Zamzam water (24.2%) had the highest percentage, whereas thermal therapy (42.5%) was the leading choice in the \"other\" CAM types ( [Table 6](javascript:void(0);)). Regarding source of information, most patients who used CAM applications received information from mass media (47%) or relatives and friends (45%) (P < .001). The most popular CAM applications were the ones related to their religion (82.1%). Discussion Type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension are the leading causes of ESRD; both of these conditions have increased in frequency with the rise in life expectancy in the population. Although ESRD is mostly seen in older people in developed countries, in Turkey, it can be seen in every age group. This can be explained by the population distribution of Turkey, as Turkey has a higher percentage of younger people than developed countries. Most research on CAM has shown statistical differences in use between the sexes, marital status, and working status. Our study showed no significant differences in CAM use among these factors. This can be explained by the cultural structure of Turkey. Although ESRD is one of the most desperate chronic diseases and involves a restricted life, the nature of the Turkish culture has a big effect on the person itself. No matter the level of education, Turkish people will listen to the advice of friends and relatives. Our study supports this contention as friends and family were an important source of information (45%), which was nearly equal with mass media as the source (47%). Studies in the United States have shown a positive correlation between CAM use and level of education, with a higher level of education equaling a higher use of CAM.24,25 However, our study showed the opposite. We found that most CAM users had either a primary school education or none. This result can be explained by the effects of culture and faith in traditional treatments in Turkey. The effects of culture and tradition in developing countries have been reported by the World Health Organization. That study indicated that, especially in developing or underdeveloped countries, most illnesses are treated with traditional methods. The influence of culture-oriented region was shown in our study. Regarding distribution of CAM users among the hemodialysis centers included in our study, patients treated and living in the southern part of Turkey had the highest percentages of CAM users (Alanya with 71.6% and skenderun with 66.7%). Knowledge on CAM therapies and applications was not significantly associated with use. Patients tended to use CAM modalities even if they did not have any idea of their purpose. The reason for this behavior can be explained by the hopelessness of ESRD patients, who are diagnosed with a chronic disease that will be life long and will require a treatment that restricts their life. These factors can create a desperate person looking for a miracle. The high CAM use with less knowledge can also be explained by the educational status of our study patients. Because most of the users had low levels of education, the information sources were limited. We observed significant associations between use of CAM and belief of CAM therapies. Among 338 patients, 162 patients had faith in CAM therapies, with 75.9% of these patients using at least one CAM therapy or application. This result is not surprising. However, it is surprising that 45% of users had no faith in the CAM treatment, perhaps using CAM as a coping mechanism. To cope with comorbidities, patients may try new things to comfort themselves even if they do not believe in them. The percentage of users among those who believed that CAM therapies were not harmful was 71%. The percentage of users who thought that CAM can be harmful and still used them was 45%; among those who had no idea about its harm, use was 53.2%. The use of CAM modalities among those who believe that they are not harmful is an expected result. Nevertheless, use among patients who believe that CAM modalities are harmful can only be explained by the progressive nature of the illness. Although this study did not study quality of life, it is a known fact that quality of life of hemodialysis patients decreases. Therefore, hemodialysis patients will do anything to improve quality of life because they believe they have nothing to lose. In addition, the placebo effect of these therapies is an undeniable factor of the continuum.23,26,27 All of these determinants can be the underlying factors of this result. Those who have nothing to lose may try anything, even if they believe it is harmful. The use of CAM before and after diagnosis was significantly different. We found that CAM use was higher before diagnosis. The reason for continued CAM use after diagnosis may be explained by the belief of patients in these remedies. They may not believe that they are harmful and may not believe that there could be a relation between the herbal remedy used and the progress of the illness. After patients are diagnosed with a chronic disease, they may more fully believe and hold on to their belief in CAM therapies.23,28-32 Complementary and alternative therapies and applications can be grouped into 3 groups. The first group, which includes herbal remedies and herbal mixtures, was the most frequently used. Ingredients included stinging nettle, apple peel, cinnamon, lemon zest, dried tea, white wine, flaxseed, garlic, ginger, cherry stem, fennel, senna, sage, rosehip, linden, molasses, sesame oil, flaxseed oil, and grape seed. Frequency of use ranged from daily to 2 or 3 times per week. The herbs listed here are different from those used in Europe and the United States.13,14,18,21,23-25,28-45 This result can be explained by vegetation differences between countries. Studies have shown that herbal mixtures are often considered safe by patients,19-23 leading to their preferred use. The second group includes religious-based applications. When patients are diagnosed with a chronic disease, they may take refuge in religion. Because ESRD is accompanied by restrictive treatment and no cure, religious activities and belief in God for a miracle may occur. We also observed this pattern in our study. The ESRD diagnosis itself led to the patient relying more on religious applications, with most stating use of Zamzam water (24.2%) followed by making offerings (16.9%). As shown in [Table 5](javascript:void(0);), although there is no scientific evidence of healing powers, patients prefer to wear evil eye beads, charms, and cevsen. This belief in their healing powers could be attributed to comfort in religion. Despite turning to use of religious-based modalities, patients did not necessarily seek advice from religious leaders. The third group of CAM therapies included thermal therapy (42.5% use), massage (30.97% use), and acupuncture (7.96% use). Because Turkey has many thermal therapy sites, resulting in a lesser cost, patients often used this CAM modality. Conclusions and suggestions Complementary and alternative therapies have a significant effect on ESRD patients, who gather knowledge on these modalities from either mass media or social engagements. There is a positive correlation between CAM use and education. Geographic origin also plays a significant role in CAM use. Doctors should alert ESRD patients about the possible dangers of CAM remedies and therapies. Mass media can also be used to inform ESRD patients and their families about the pros and cons of CAM use. A similar study in patients after transplant could be helpful to see the effects of CAM therapies.
