She'll share some health challenges that are caused by toxins as well as how you can work to naturally cleanse your immune system. Hi everyone. I'm Sandra Pascal from North Carolina. And I'm here today to talk about toxic load and how it affects our immune system and overall wellbeing. Well, before I get into that, I like to tell you a little bit more about myself and how I even get introduced to these amazing products. Long, long time ago, six years ago, you can believe that, this amazing woman was bugging me and texting me and Facebooking me and anything me, trying to get me to try these amazing essential oils. And I would just yeah, yeah, maybe next week. Oh I can't. Oh I'm busy. Oh whatever, like any excuse in the book not to go. Meanwhile I was at home trying to figure out how I could support my emotions in a healthy way because the things that I was doing were definitely not working. Overeating. Using alcohol. And even some other questionable substances. And life can get stressful. I was a full-time working mom and I was married, and I had a really high-power job, which I actually loved and enjoyed. But just the days in and out of being a mom and a wife and a full-time career woman was starting to cause havoc on my health. And it all started with my stress. And we started to notice that the more stress I had, the less sleep I got, the less quality sleep I got, and the more bad decisions I was making with the things that I was putting into my body. So after an entire year, I finally said yes and I welcomed doTERRA into my life and nothing has ever been the same. I've used these products to support my emotions, to support my health, especially my immune system, and we've had amazing results. Stress Management and Reducing Toxic Load So I want to dive in a little deeper and talk about more specifically on reducing toxic load, why we should do that, and how it impacts our immune system. So everything was going really well until about a year and a half ago when I went to go see my doctor and they had some unfortunate, which actually turned out to be a very big blessing in my life. It was one of those moments when you find yourself wondering is this a dream? Am I dreaming? Is this really happening? No, he can't be talking to me. Like he must have the wrong chart. Nope, it was Sandra Pascal he was talking about. And as freaked out as I was, and as scared as I was, at the same time, it was very comforting to know that I had doTERRA in my life and that I was going to be able to get to do a cleansing from a body, mind and spirit level. And what was very clear working with my team of doctors is that I needed to reduce my toxic load. So, what do you mean toxic load? Like what are you talking about? I eat organic. I use the oils. I'm using this. I'm doing that. Well, for me we went back to stress management. So I was able to incorporate and look a little bit deeper into the products and low and behold doTERRA had introduced new products into our already amazing arsenal of magic-ness. Copaiba Essential Oil and Stress Management So one of them Copaiba. I love this oil. This came in just in the nick of time. And why all the rage about Copaiba? Well, because there is a lot of talk right now about CBD on the market. And people are getting results from it. And I'm not saying that it doesn't work. It's just for me and for my piece of mind, Copaiba is my essential oil of choice when we're talking about cannabinoids because it actually doesn't have that ingredient in it that can cause those unwanted side effects. Like those hallucinogenic side effects. And it actually helps with boosting my immune system.* It really helps me balance my emotions.* I really love using this oil first thing in the morning. A drop on my tongue just like this. Sorry, I can't talk about the product and not use them. It's a thing. So I love ingesting Copaiba every single day. And what I really, there's just so many things I love about doTERRA but the standard of quality and purity is so incredible that I know that I'm comfortable and I feel safe ingesting these oils. I know that there's no fillers or contaminants. They haven't been adulterated. They're exactly the way that Mother Nature intended them to be. So that just makes me feel so awesome and I can just rest assured that it's all good baby. It's just Copaiba in the bottle. Nothing else. Reducing Exposure to Toxicity So, let's talk about exactly what toxic loads that I need to look at. And that we should all be looking at. So we're exposed to toxicity all day every day. And as much as we try to be proactive, listen we gotta breathe, right? And a lot of us live in different areas and different countries have different levels of toxicity when it comes to their air. Gases, fumes from cars, so what can you do to reduce that toxic load? Well I'm gonna tell you in a second. Every day we're exposed to toxins in our environment. In the food that we eat, the products that we use in our home to clean it, the products that we use in our bathroom. Did you guys know that one of the most toxic times of the day is happening first thing in the morning in our bathroom? When I heard that, I was blown away because I always thought oh, you get up in the morning, you go to the bathroom, you take a shower, you're getting ready. How could that possibly be the most toxic time of the day? Well, it makes a lot of sense. You're in the shower. You have warm water. You're opening up your pores. And here you go lathering yourself up with all these concoctions and lotions and potions and shampoos and conditioners and face cleaners and scrubs, and this and that. And your pores are nice and wide open just sucking in all those toxins, all those chemicals, all those artificial fillers and craziness that they put in these products that we're using. And I never thought of that. It really never crossed my mind. I just looked at oh, frizz free. Or this'll help my skin be smoother. Or anti-aging. Or exfoliating. That's what I was looking at. I really wasn't turning the bottles and looking at the ingredients. And once I started doing that, what does that say? What does that mean? Why am I putting this on my body? And you may think well it's not a big deal. It's just, it's a quick shower. Yeah but you're doing this day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year. And eventually, your immune system starts to take a hit. And it all started in your bathroom in your shower. Now we get out of the shower and here we go. Round two of toxicity let's just lather on some yummy, fruity, strawberry creamsicle smelling concoctions on our body to make our skin nice and soft. And then let's just put some more face stuff on. And there you go, round two. And then for the women watching this, here with go with the makeup, right? And then hairsprays and all these other things we're putting in our hair. Hair dyes. Nail polish. It's just like chemical, chemical, chemical, chemical, chemical. One on top of the other. And then we start feeling lethargic and tired. And we're not losing weight the way that we would like to. As quickly as we would like to. We're starting to feel some brain fog. Even our memory starts to be affected. And our skin, we start to see it in our skin. It's dry and we start having skin issues. And we're breaking out. And we wonder what am I doing wrong? What's happening? Well, let's talk about what are you using to clean your house with? Your floors and your windows. And what are you using to clean your dishes? And what detergents are you using? All of these things. Toxic, toxic, toxic. Non-Toxic Alternatives and Solutions And I'm not trying to here to scare you guys. This is just information. And when we're informed, then we can make better decisions. And listen, as scary as this all has been sounding, there's good news. We have amazing products to reduce that toxic load. So I'm not saying you can't take a shower again and you can't put moisturizer on again or you can't wash your clothes again or you can't clean your house again. No, doTERRA to the rescue. We have a line of products to take care of us from the inside and out. So in the bathroom, in the shower I use our shampoo and conditioner. I use our face washes and our exfoliators. We have an amazing line of face creams and they're anti-aging. We have them for all kinds of skin types. We have serums for our hair, which I love. I actually haven't dyed my hair in a year because I needed to reduce the toxic load in my body so I had to make some choices. So there you go. It's slowly growing out. You can see it. It's actually in style right now to have triple, quadruple colors in your hair so I don't look that much of an outsider. But that's what's happening right now. I'm not dyeing my hair. And yes ladies I have grays too. And I don't care because to me, it's about making a choice about weighing it out. It's not about being perfect, but just picking and choosing what it is that you're gonna do and how much you're willing to compromise your health. And for me, dyeing my hair, ah, who cares? Like forget about it, I really don't care. So it is what it is. And look how shiny my hair is. I love it. I get lots of compliments. And it's all because of the doTERRA shampoo, conditioner and serum. I love it. Use it all the time. Creating Routines The second thing that I highly recommend is that you just start a daily routine. So having the oils and the products placed in your home for easy access is going to help you stay on a routine. And it's gonna help you stay on track to be able to continuously take the products and use them on a consistent basis. So that you can create long term results. Lemon Essential Oil So next to my bed stand I have a glass of water. And first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is put a drop of Lemon oil in my water and take a sip. Super easy. And it tastes amazing. Now why would we want to ingest Lemon essential oil? Well because, and for those of you who haven't done this experiment, put a drop of Lemon essential oil on a styrofoam cup, come back two minutes later and see what happens. What I love about this is that you're going to ingest this essential oil and it's gonna help you with your digestive system.* It's gonna help it get all those pipes nice and clean. So in the morning and before I go to bed, I like to take a drop of Lemon essential oil in my water. Supplements Even though our essential oils are the number one in the planet, do you know what our number one product is? Our supplements. I love our doTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack\u00ae. These supplements have everything that your body needs to function.* Now I know that a lot of us are really working hard to eat right. But it doesn't matter how much you try, it's really hard to get everything that you need on a daily basis into your body. You would have to eat these insane amounts of kale in order to get the right dosage that you need for your body. So what did doTERRA do? As usual, they make our life easier by giving us this amazing Vitality pack that has everything that our body needs. So let me break it down for you real quick. Our Alpha CRS+\u00ae is amazing. This is our cellular vitality. And boom, you take your Alpha CRS+ and it's gonna help you have nice healthy cells.* And one of the main ingredients in our Alpha CRS+ is actually milk thistle. And it's known as the king of detoxifying herbs. So this supports your liver and your cells.* So you're definitely gonna want to take this every single day. There's also turmeric in this. The next bottle is our xEO Mega\u00ae. Love it. Why do we take this? Because it has amazing fish oils and plant based oils and it works beautifully for our neurological system and our cardiovascular system.* Really important. So remember how I was telling you about my emotions when I first started in doTERRA? This baby was a huge game changer for me. So if you're watching this and you need emotional support, you gotta get on this. Like it's a no brainer. Like you have to have it. And then last, but not least, going back to food because food fuels our body, it's what gives us energy. The Microplex VMz\u00ae, amazing food nutrient complex. Jam packed with all the vitamins and minerals that we need to have a nice system. * Now I know that this is gonna look like it's weird, people think I'm crazy, but I'd be crazy not to walk around with my supplements all the time. I don't leave home without 'em. They mean the world to me. And I honestly can feel the difference when I'm off of them. And I know that thousands and hundreds of thousands of you watching this video agree with me that when we're off of these for like two weeks, it's like . It's like total panic mode. We can totally see the shift in mood, in energy, in focus, in clarity, in our sleep. It's like downhill. It's a recipe for disaster. So I never leave home without this. Remember when I was telling you before to place products in easy to spot places, they're easy to reach and you can use them? This is how I carry around my supplements so that they're just always ready to go and I don't ever have to miss my dosage because I don't think anybody in my house wants me to miss my dosage of my supplements. All right. So enough of that. Let's talk about DigestZen TerraZyme\u00ae. TerraZyme is also really powerful supplement that you must take every day. Because when we cook our foods, they lose a lot of their natural enzymes so it's harder for our body to process our food when we ingest it. So I like to take one of these with my meal and I know that my food's going in, and these enzymes are gonna break it down, and my body's gonna absorb the nutrients.* Oh, I gotta go back to our supplements. Something that makes them so amazing is also the way that they're formulated. Our body reads them as a whole food complex. So it's able to break it down and absorb it. And that's why they are so amazing because listen, I tried all the supplements, pretty much all of them out on the market, and I was really skeptical to try our supplements because I really had never gotten long term results. And that's why is because the ingredients, the quality, it wasn't there. The delivery system. My body wasn't understanding what I was taking so it was like I don't know what that is, let's just get rid of it. But when I take the LLV, my body understands it and it reads it and it's able to absorb it. And I get the results, the benefits from it. So another product that I am totally in love with, that really helps improve my immune system* and support it is our one and only DDR Prime\u00ae. I love this. You can get it in the softgel form or you can also get it in the essential oil form. I take two of these every single day. This helps my cells stay nice and healthy.8 It helps rejuvenate them. It helps with oxidative stress.* And when we're talking about all these toxins that are in our body that through our air, our food, you're definitely gonna want to get on DDR Prime. Frankincense Essential Oil Frankincense, the king of all oils. It's a must have. I love taking this every single day to support healthy brain* and something very interesting that I learned about when your immune system's compromised, you can actually start to feel achy joints.* So I am going to teach you guys something really simple and easy to do. You can just take Frankincense straight up on your tongue or you can put it in a glass of water. But we have these empty veggie capsules. And what I like to do. And I'm gonna show you how easy it is you guys. I really encourage you to take two to three drops of Frankincense, put it in your veggie cap. And easy peasy. Boom. Just like that and you've got Frankincense in your system. On Guard\u00ae Now, when we're talking about immune support,* we cannot leave out the one and only, and I know every mama's favorite out there, On Guard. This beautiful essential oil blend is made to protect and help boost our immune system. And it's so amazing that we just don't have it in an oil form, we have the beadlets. If you guys don't have these, you need to have these. This has to be in your car. You have to have one in your purse ladies. Kids in their backpacks. This is a must have. When I'm out and about, I don't have to get worried and stressed out. I just simply pop one of these babies in my mouth and I know that I'm protected. And I know for me, I was a super germophobe, so hand sanitizers. I would just bathe in those. Want to talk about toxic. They're full of alcohol and crazy chemicals. But we have our beautiful On Guard spray. It smells amazing. It's easy to carry. Easy to use. And it's safe. My kids have these in their backpack. So super easy to use our products. Cinnamon Bark Essential Oil The other product that I wanted to highlight, when we talk about our immune system I am really passionate about Cinnamon Bark. Cinnamon Bark has always been one of my favorite oils. And I just love the smell of it. Probably because it evokes memories of my childhood and Christmas. And just all those yummy desserts. But, now that I've researched more into it, I fell in love with it even more. Because, well let me tell a little bit about more actually where this comes from. So Cinnamon Bark is an evergreen tree. And it can grow up to be up to 45 feet high. And we actually extract the cinnamon oil from the bark. And the reason why I love cinnamon is because it actually helps maintain a healthy immune system.* And it also supports a healthy metabolic function.* So for all of you out there trying to stimulate your metabolism, cinnamon is a great essential oil to use every day.* And it's a hot oil. So what I mean by that is that you may have a sensitivity to it if you were to put it directly on your skin, so you don't want to do that. You're gonna want to grab your coconut oil and you're gonna place two to three drops on your skin like so, and what you're doing is that you always want to use precaution and safety. You don't want to just go ahead and start pouring oils on your skin. Because some oils can be hot like cinnamon. And so what you're doing when you're applying coconut oil is you're creating a barrier, a protective barrier, between your skin and the essential oil. So you can go ahead and apply a drop of the essential oil on your skin. And you won't have a reaction. So I love using cinnamon in a hot cup of tea. It's tastes amazing. Also, for all of you chefs out there or foodies, cinnamon apple crisps. How does that sound? How does a cinnamon apple shake in the morning sound? Amazing. How about putting this in icings? To flavor icings or any of your favorite desserts? Also, I learned something when I was on a trip to Mexico that you can take a Mason jar and put sugar in it, your favorite sweetener. And you could actually drop some cinnamon, just one drop of cinnamon oil in there, shake it up and then now you have cinnamon sugar for your pastries, or for your hot chocolate, or your coffee and it tastes amazing. I love it. It's so, so, so, so good. Also on yams. I know during our holiday season, we use a lot of Cinnamon Bark in our cooking. So isn't this so cool how this oil has these properties that can help us with our immune system*, our metabolism*, and at the same time it tastes amazing and we can eat it and put it in our food? So here you are you're thinking you're eating this amazing cinnamon apple shake in the morning, but you're getting all the health benefits of doTERRA essential oil or Cinnamon Bark. Body Butter I also wanted to share a quick tip with you guys. Remember when I was talking about what we put on our skin and our body, how toxic it can be? All those lotions and potions. Well, I like to take our body butter and I buy these containers and then I put our creams and lotions in these smaller containers so that they're easy to carry around in my purse and I have 'em and I don't have to worry about putting toxic stuff on my skin or my children. I have clean, healthy, beautiful, high quality ingredients that I know aren't gonna harm me or my children. So that's just a little tip on how I carry some of my favorite doTERRA products around. Support the Immune System by Reducing Toxins Removing toxins from our body is really important so we can have a healthy immune system. Long term exposure to toxins is gonna compromise your mood, your brain health, your immune system, your cells, and we don't want that. So remember to use our doTERRA products on a daily basis. Start off small. Don't get overwhelmed. I recommend the Lifelong Vitality pack. It's easy peasy. Everything's in there. Grab some Lemon in your water. Hey, better yet, why don't you get the Healthy Habits kit? It's all there ready for you to go. It's an easy way to get started for those of you right now that are feeling a little overwhelmed. Well, do I need every oil? Well, yeah you do, but. But you can just rest assured that dTERRA has put together a really awesome kit. It's called the Healthy Habits kit. And it's got the basics of what you need to support your immune system and reduce toxic load in your body.* Next, take a look at your house. Start writing a list of the things that are in your home that are questionable. Look at the ingredients on the back of your products. Start with your shower in your bathroom. And start getting rid of those. Next, move into the kitchen. And last but not least, into your garage. And slowly but surely welcome doTERRA into your home. And one day at a time you'll start making changes that'll be long term. And you're gonna start seeing the positive effects, not only on your body, but in your body, and your body, mind, and spirit with you and your family and hey, your friends might even start asking you, \"You're looking really good. \"You have energy. \"What are you doing? \"Your skin looks amazing. \"Your hair is so shiny. \"And, are you looking younger?\" And the answer is yes. 'Cause that's what happens when you have less toxicity in your body and you bring in more healthy natural products into your life. It was a pleasure to be here with you today.
