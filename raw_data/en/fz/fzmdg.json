I use this oil in a diffuser at night. It relaxes me so much! And it helps my two small children wind down and go to sleep too. I first discovered Snow Lotus through my acupuncturist. First blend I ever tried was Digestease. It worked so well I began ordering more oils from here. Meditation blend is the best and my favorite by far. I put a few drops on my wrists and perform alternate nostril breathing. Instant calm. My mood is leveled throughout the day. Highly recommend this blend and Snow Lotus brand. I LOVE how this smells. This blend is perfection. Frankincense, Myrrh, Sandalwood - Divine I use this blend every day. It smells so great and immediately grounds you and calms anxiety. Also great to use before bed to relax into sleep. I share it with my yoga students before class and they are obsessed! It's the best oil I own! This oil is out of this world! Amazing. Our whole meditation class bought their own bottles after we used it in class. "}
