So, my answer below is based ... [](https://rita-kara-robinson.com/dairy-intolerance/) My team and I love dealing with autism cases - because the scope for healing is immense. We see the power of detoxing daily and it is a privilege to be part of watching these children unfold like rosebuds. Based on my own first-hand experience, homeopathy is so much easier than supplements, gentler than chelation and more effective than other therapies. I have seen children begin to talk, regain speech, develop understanding and begin to play with toys - it's so exciting to hear about how their school teachers have noticed big changes whilst completely unaware that they are doing a homeopathic detox. Many parents speak of their children changing their behaviour after a specific vaccine. Other parents say there were problems from birth. Depending on the perceived cause, there are two ways to treat this homeopathically. If vaccines are thought to be the cause - then you can detox those vaccines with one of my detox programs. I also use classical prescribing where I choose 1 or 2 remedies that fit the whole picture. Information linking autism with vaccines is growing rapidly and widely available on the web. You you do not. Autism labels are not actually very useful to me. Every single child I see with this diagnosis has a different set of symptoms and strengths. The symptoms they have in common have different intensities, triggers, and frequency. No two prescriptions are alike. I treat the child not the label. I work with many children on the spectrum who are not vaccinated. Working with me doesn't just involve detoxing vaccines and medicines. I have many remedies to help autism symptoms. There is no answer for this. I cannot predict anything for anyone, on the spectrum or not. This depends on many things : age, sleep, diet, stress, home life, school life, family dynamics, interaction with your child, other therapies, medical history and so on. Homeopathy is a part of the puzzle. Many other things need to be aligned to get quick progress and these things are out of my control and out of any therapist's control whatever therapy you choose. Healing isn't about pills - it's about a whole healing system that takes into account the whole person. If you are focussed on many aspects of your child's life then the road should be easier. There is no quick fix for brain trauma. It takes time whatever method you choose. However, I am aiming to do my best in the shortest amount of time. if you are aiming to do one session only... then I suggest that perhaps you consider not booking in. I work with people over a significant period of time - which is why I have a waitlist. People stay with me. The symptoms didn't come overnight, and chances are your child has had these issues for many years. So healing them in 2 months is unrealistic- for any therapy. One needs patience and to focus on the gentle consistent gains when trying to heal a child on the spectrum and realise we are in theory trying to do brain surgery without any tools. Homeopathy is based on teeny tiny sugar pills which are coated with super diluted substances which have no taste ( because they are so diluted many times over). This means they are very easy to take and many parents tell me the children look forward to taking them. Fantastic! These are my favourite clients because we have the biggest chance of full reversal when we see the clients under 3 years old. The younger the better. Babies need very few sessions. Follow your mother's instinct and focus on healing your child and not on waiting to get a label. The groove gets deeper each year that passes.

Luke is a 5 year old who had the ... As we are the most experienced homeopathic team dealing with this type of case, we have decided to only take on clients who fit the new criteria below. If you do not fit the criteria below then homeopathy can still work for you, but we are not the right therapists for you. 1. The patient has to be committed to healing themselves and understand that they are fully responsible for their health. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? That the patient doesn't rely on us and the pills to do all the work. To understand that their lifestyle choices will speed up or impair recovery and that no medicine can be a substitute for lifestyle choices that hinder recovery. At the end of the day, we are all responsible for ourselves, and the choices we make. 2. To begin working with us the patient has to have in place or commit to having a clean sleep routine. This means going to sleep with the lights out by 10 pm the latest and being on no devices an hour beforehand. All of our patients have adrenal fatigue and thyroid issues. When you go to bed late or are on devices late, then too much light is being emitted from phones/tablets a few inches from your eyes. That amount of bright light signals the body to make more adrenaline because it thinks it's in the afternoon and that then creates more cortisol that prevents sleep and makes you tired in the morning. Melatonin and pineal levels are messed up too. Our patients have severely imbalanced hormones, and melatonin, the pineal gland, adrenals and the thyroid all need to be in balance to recover. If your sleep cycle is out, you don't need pills to correct it - you just need to get a clean sleep routine and your body will get into balance in a couple of days. What you do when you are recovered is up to you - but if you want to work with us, this is a non-negotiable requirement. 3. You are not on the contraceptive pill or are on steroid inhalers. These are synthetic hormones and are a big block to curing. When someone is on these, we can't really get started as they are contributing to the hormones being unbalanced. We can work with you if you intend to come off the pill before your prescription starts or if you intend to come off inhalers before we start detoxing. We cannot start detoxing or bring you to a full recovery unless these 2 medicines are out of the picture. We can help with period pain, and asthma anyway in the prescriptions. If you are fully reliant on these medicines then we are not the therapists for you. 4. You have a good diet and eat vegetables. What you eat affects your health. A lot of the imbalance in the body centres in the stomach. This doesn't mean you have stomach pains - but your microbiome is key to healing. We are looking for patients who eat some vegetables and fruits. We cannot work with patients who just eat processed food and no fruits and vegetables at all. We can work with patients who have a limited diet but are committed to eating a wider variety of healthy foods. If you don't meet this criteria it will take too long to help you fully recover and we will only get halfway. 5. If you are on prescribed medicines it is your wish and intention to get off them. Some patients want to stay on medication while asking us to fully heal them. All medicines come with side effects, which we can't heal while the patient is on them, therefore we are being asked to do an impossible task. Of course, we see many patients on meds and they end up reducing their dosage and not needing them. They actively don't want to be on them. If you are happy with any medicines and want to stay on them, then we are not the therapists for you. We are interested in working with people who want to be fully and holistically well, and only then can we work to the best of our ability. IF YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS CRITERIA THEN PLEASE DO EMAIL ME. If you fulfil this criteria then we are confident that we can heal the majority of patients in 1-3 sessions. WE WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH YOU. "}
