Then I realized how much wonderful reading there is packed into this journal and decided you may appreciate some fun pictures instead. So here are some photos of my dear sweet English Springer Spaniel, Halle. I have also included some of Halle's favorite \"people\" to play with. Enjoy this wonderful issue compiled by NAHA's own Kelly Holland Azzaro with the help and donation of all of the wonderful Authors and contribu- tors that make every issue like this possible. Blessings, Michele A. Miller -Clarke Greetings from the President \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 4 Kelly Holland Azzaro NAHA Vice President Photo by Todd Bush I had a wonderful and enlightening experience gathering articles, case studies, research, poems and personal stories for this amazing animal theme -based journal. The best part was getting to work with amazing people who took the time to share their information and getting to know their animal friends through reading their stories of love and devotion. At times I would find myself having tears flow as I felt Joyce's grief of the loss of her beloved Ms. Truf fle and Jennifer's boy Morgan. My own sadness of our boy Teddy and how his passing allowed me to channel my grief onto paper to share with others was a powerful part of the healing process. Tears of joy over - poured for the happiness found in Monty the pony's story shared by Anna Knight. Anna was so generous in devoting much time to sharing a very educational article on Animal Aromatics -the Power of Selection which includes equine case -studies. I got to meet a new friend and fellow Aromatherapist Lisa Davis who shared two amazing stories of how Animal Aromatics had profound positive results with her two fur babies, Sweet Pea and Hyde. Both Anna and Lisa have studied with Animal Aromatics founder and pioneer Caroline Ingraham. If you have not met or studied with Caroline you are really missing out on a rare gem. Caroline is such a lovely woman, she has a gift that she shares with others when it comes to Animal Aro- matics. Visit Caroline's website to learn more about her amazing animal adventures from working with donkeys in Spain to elephants in Kenya (read about this very moving story in the International Federation of Aromatherapists In Essence Win- ter 2007 Vol. 6 No. 3 journal www.ifparoma.org ). One of my teachers Dr. Bruce Berkowsky the founder of Spiritual PhytoEssencing as always shares a unique and pro- found way to work with essential oils for deep soul level work. This is something that many animal lovers can relate to and that is the deep love they have for their animal companions, a soul -friend bond. Prof. Dr. Jurgen Reichling of Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Dep. of Biology research paper Phyto- therapeutical use of essential oils in veterinarian medicine will also be included on the NAHA website's Research section along with an update from Tony Burfield of Cropwatch educating about the use of animal byproducts in the cosmetics in- dustry and how we can help protect the welfare and rights of animals by not using products that contain ingredients such as emu oil, shark and turtle oil, civet paste, musk oil, and castoreum. Connecting with Jann Garitty of the Flower Essence Society and her generosity in allowing NAHA the permission to in- clude the FES chart of flower essence helpful for your animal friends allowed me the opportunity to expand my own flower essence work to another level. I found that their Post -Trauma Stabilizer essence has helped me and my animals to move through the past trauma (see 2007.1 issue) and with Teddy's passing. Jann also shared with me how the FES website has an entire section devoted to animals and the caregivers who give from the heart by way of working with the essences and each animal's individuality. Animal lovers always want to do what is best for their animal friends many make sacrifices in their own life in order to pro- vide for their best friends. Aromatherapy and flower essences can be effective and affordable tools that can help transform \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 5 NAHA Vice President an emotional blockage and decrease stress. When working with animals it is important to include them as part of the choice process. It is also very important to work with safe aromatherapy techniques and avoid exposing your animal to any unnecessary harm that could be experienced by such applications of using essential oil neat along the animal's spine or applying essential oils directly into their nostrils or ear cavities. NAHA Safety Committee and Board Members under the guidance of Safety Chair Sylla Sheppard Hanger have worked very diligently on the Essential Oil Reaction Report Form http://www.naha.org/safety.htm . This form is available for submitting information on any type of negative reaction to unsafe essential oil applications to people and pets, and is a valuable tool and resource for the NAHA Membership and general public. Unfor- tunately NAHA has heard of an equine and caregiver suffering from the negative effects of multiple applica- tions of RDT http://www.naha.org/rdt_statement.htm we hope that this horse will recover without any perma- nent ill health. The internet provides us with an endless supply of information, doing a world -wide web -search for animal aromatherapy data I stumbled upon a website that had a link to someone who is applying essential oils neat to the spine on every cat that is being brought in for adoption! I feel blessed to be able to bring all these people and their unique animal's stories together into one format for all of us to learn, share and grow. How exciting to have such a wide variety of works in this journal issue from veterinarian phytotherapeutical research, animal aromatics and zoopharmacognosy to working on a subtle and spiritual level allowing the animals to guide us along the way. I am extremely grateful to everyone who donated their time and energy to writing, editing and even offering to write book reviews. You can feel their passion and love they have for animals and I want to honor each and every one of you and your animals for the gift of sharing that with all of us. We all have a little of Dr. Doolittle in all of us! I'd like to share that I also have had the unique opportunity to work with some very special farm animals that have a one of a kind home Apple Hill Farm whose motto is a place where animals speak and people listen. Horses, llamas, alpacas, donkeys, goats, dogs and cats are all open to receiving natural forms of holistic therapies including aromatherapy, flower essences, massage and reiki. Recently MM a mother boar goat ral- lied after intestinal issues. To see her reunited with her fellow goat family makes me sing each time I see her lovely face as I call out MM how you doing girl... she walks over to the fence line and smiles, if you can imag- ine a goat smile. Now I know that our part was very small as I only created a tummy rub blend for her caregiv- ers Lee and Kathleen to apply to her belly and for inhalation. I also offered MM reiki energy work each night while she was stalled in the main barn while allowing her the choice to inhale the aromatherapy blend and my husband did Qigong therapy and healing chants over MM's body -field. Her caregivers provided around the clock care, physically, emotionally and spiritually, we all were witness to MM's miraculous recovery. Was aro- matherapy a part of that recovery, I hope so, yet most importantly I feel it was the intentions of all who love MM and who knew in their hearts that she'd be ok. If MM was living at another place I don't know if true heal- ing would have been the same outcome. I feel it is important to share how special people such as you and those at Apple Hill Farm have such tremendous love and respect for the well -being of animals it is truly inspir- ing. I hope to have more animal aromatherapy stories to share for future journals. We'd love to hear yours! \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 6 By Anna Knight Animals that roam wild seek out plants and minerals that they instinctively know they need, both to nourish and to medicate themselves. The animals we care for dont often have this opportunity - but we can help them, by offering for their self -selection concentrated plant essences and natural substances with the power to protect and heal. This process is known as Animal Aromatics (the Ingraham method). Profound health im- provements can be experienced when an animal selects its own cure from a range of essen- tial oils, plant extracts, herbs and minerals. Zoopharmacognosy - the interface between evolution and health Millions of years ago, all animals lived wild, out in the middle of nature, amongst the plants which nourished them. They evolved along with these plants. As the earth and its climate underwent changes, so the plants changed; the animals evolved t o adapt to these changes. The plants in turn developed defence mechanisms to protect themselves from the animals that grazed on them - as well as from other things, such as potentially destructive insects and infections. Then the animals developed physiological tools to deal in turn with these measures taken by the plants, so they could graze safely. (Even carnivorous an imals had a dependent relationship on plants: indirectly, as they predated the animals which ate the plants; and directly as they a te plant material from the gut of their prey and also would eat/interact with fresh plants if they needed them.) One of the means of protection which plants evolved was that they started producing essential oils in specially adapted cells . These cocktails of chemicals all had powerful smells, mostly bitter tastes, and sometimes profound effects when ingested by a ni- mals. They could have the effect of poisoning if they were over -eaten when not needed. If they were needed, however, they were health -maintaining or healing. The animals had to make adaptations to help them work out which was which; to avoid taking in unwanted secondary metabolites with their food material, and conversely to seek out compounds which might be needed for re- balancing the system. And so they developed: - A powerful sense of smell. Most animals have a sense of smell hundreds of times more efficient than a human's. They have many times more scent receptors in their olfactory system and also have the vomeronasal organ (organ of Jacobsen), which seems to enable them to read chemical messages in the primitive, limbic system of the brain (the two organs are closely connected anatomically). Expansion of the parts of the brain needed to interpret sensory input - in other words, they learned to recognise and distin- guish the plant chemicals by smell. A digestive and metabolic system which could cope with the plant chemicals once they were in the body. As the animals evolved this became an innate wisdom which has protected wild animals and kept them healthy in their habitats through the millennia, and which they still practise, given the opportunity, today. A negative example of self -selection as it e xists today would be the horse grazing in a field containing ragwort. The ragwort is still waist -high although the other herbage is ea ten to within centimetres of the ground. The horse can read the ragwort's scent -signals that it contains compounds which are haz- ardous if not needed. A positive example, on the other hand, would be the well -fed dog who fossicks around in a hedgerow and finds, some cleaver plant ( Galium aparine ) and munches on it, maybe for its diuretic properties. Animals need to choose Innate, evolved behaviours become behaviours which animals need to enact in order to maintain physical and mental equilibrium. Self-selection of food and medicine is as much an innate behaviour as mutual grooming and constant free movement are for horses or forming pack hierarchies is for dogs. Domestic and captive animals have (necessarily in some cases) compromised and adapted living environments, but we often find that we ignore or deny their expression of their innate behaviours at our peril. There is increasing recognition of this among humans, perhaps especially in the case of horses where it's widely acknowledged Animal Aromatics \u2014The Power of Self -Selection \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 7 for example that constant stabling, i.e. denying them free movement and association with their own species, has a detrimental psychological effect which in turn impacts on the horse's health and training, creates safety issues and thus compromises its use- fulness as a domestic animal. Domestic animals' food and medicine is chosen for them, and dosed, according to the often widel y varying opinions of a being whose natural wisdom in these matters has been lost as its cortex grew and it became more sight - dependent. No wonder, it could be said, they often fall prey to illnesses and imbalances. Instead, self -selection should be one of a raft of innate animal behaviours which we as their custodians should strive to facilitate. Unfortunately the process is severely curtailed for most of our domestic animals. They cannot be allowed the range of a wild ani- mal (a wild horse would cover about 50 miles a day); fields, stables, kennels, human houses/gardens, hutches etc. are all lim ited in their bio -diverse range. This has several unfortunate effects: an animal can have a severe and long -lasting lack of a nutrie nt or secondary metabolite, leading to illness; or worse still, an animal might exercise its self - selective ability only so far, with detri- mental results. For example horses will often eat acorns because acorns are high in carbohydrates. If they had complete free range, they would probably then go and eat a plant high in saponins to offset the high level of tannins in the acorns. If the y can only perform one half of this procedure, the tannins may have a poisonous effect. So the animal needs to have a choice from a s wide a range of plants as possible. This is where the Animal Aromatics practitioner comes in. Not An Aromatherapist Aromatics is not aromatherapy, which for some (especially in countries where clinical aromatherapy is not practised) has co nno- tations of pleasant fragrances, relaxing massages and whale music! It has in common with aromatherapy only that it makes use of essential plant oils. It is, rather, a way of working with animals' primitive natures to allow them to harness the powerfu l healing substances in the plants with which they have an evolutionary relationship. Aromatics professionals do not diagnose, dose , or treat, but use their observations of an animal's constitution (including any presenting ailments), their knowledge of the p owers of individual plant extracts and, not least, their extensive kit to facilitate the animal in choosing its remedies. The owner is then given the tools to continue this process until balance is restored to the animal; but the animal always guides the route to this re storation in terms of choice and dosage. The term animal aromatics was coined by Caroline Ingraham , a Tisserand -trained aromatherapist who was the first to apply the principles of zoopharmacognosy to the treatment of domestic animals. She was the pioneer in bringing the plant materials to animals who do not have the range to seek out and forage the plants themselves; and over the last twenty years she has had some astonishing success in enabling these animals to heal, and written the only comprehensive guides on the subject.* Aromatics professionals do not only use essential oils, but a variety of substances: - Essential oils and absolutes The biggest group of Aromatics, essential oils and absolutes are as their name suggests the intrinsic essence of the properti es of a plant, derived from it by a process of steam distillation (or solvent extraction in the case of absolutes) and consisting e ntirely of secondary metabolites. Each has its own unmistakable smell and is made up of a unique mixture of around fifty individual pla nt chemicals which work in synergy to create the oil's unique properties. The essential oils used in Aromatics, because animals might select them for ingestion, have to be of the very highest quality and organically produced if at all possible. Cold-pressed oils Oils such as we would be familiar with from kitchen/culinary use; the group includes olive, rice bran and sunflower oils. The y do not smell nearly as distinctive as essential oils to us, yet it's surprising how picky animals can be in selecting one and no t an- other! They are often used in Aromatics as base oils (to dilute essential oils with), and yet they have health -giving properties in their own right. Some indeed should not be used as base oils for this reason, for example hemp, flax, evening primrose, borag e, black cumin and argan oils. They are wonderful sources of essential fatty acids, which have abundant health implications for ani- mals, as well as having their own unique properties. Animal Aromatics \u2014The Power of Self -Selection \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 8 Macerated oils Base oils in which plant material has been steeped, usually over several weeks; the oil is then strained off, and retains the prop- erties of the plant which have leeched into it. Most herbs can be macerated and it's a useful way of allowing animals to take the active ingredients of a plant that can't be steam distilled easily, or which should be taken carefully (they are in much lowe r con- centrations in macerates). Commonly used macerates wort, marigold and chickweed. Aromatic waters Also known as hydrolats, these are the by -products of steam distillation. They contain many of the properties of the essential o il in a gentler form and are very useful in their own right. Animals are often keen to lick them in large quantities and where t he cost of an oil, or difficulty in sourcing it is prohibitive (e.g. melissa oil) using the hydrolat can be a good alternative. A cou ple are gentle enough to use in topical application on the eyes. Dried herbs in powdered or whole form Dried herbal extracts can be very useful in treating animals. In powdered form, maybe mixed with water or base oil, they can be easily identified and easily absorbed and contain the useful active ingredients of the plant, though in lower concentration t han in an essential oil. Dandelion root, liquorice root, slippery elm, wheatgrass are among the most frequently used. The disadvanta ge with offering herbs in chopped dried form to animals is that their individual smell is not very strong and identifiable by th e animal. For this reason, among others, herbalists dose the animal rather than allowing it to self -select; and this is also why horses can get ragwort poisoning, by eating the dried plant undetected in hay. Aromatics professionals, therefore, tend to make much les s, very selective use of dried herbs. Powdered minerals Owners often observe that animals will appear to eat or lick soil. This is not necessarily a bad thing - the animal is probably trying (and hopefully succeeding!) to get some mineral that it needs. In Aromatics, different clays are used both topically or inter nally to draw toxins from the intestinal tract, carry needed minerals into the system, draw infection from the skin or protect it from the sun. Powdered chalk, Dead Sea mud and silica are also sometimes used. Fresh herbs Herbivores love fresh herbs and will forage for them given the chance. There are occasions when they will prefer to tuck into a sheaf of fresh comfrey leaves or wilted nettles rather than take a concentrated essence. Caution has to be exercised, for th e reasons discussed above and also because you have to be completely sure you can identify the plant you are offering, and that the animal isn't taking it because it is hungry. (Animals will not take essential oils or other extracts out of hunger.) Infused/decocted herbs, tinctures Some Aromatics professionals have had some success with tinctures of herbs, including flower remedies; they can be problem- atic when it comes to self -selection, however. Is the animal refusing because it doesn't need the herbal essence, or because it wants to avoid the alcohol, or because the alcohol is masking the smell of the herb? There are occasions when infusions/ decoctions are useful for poultices, dressings and skin complaints, and an infusion of eyebright is a useful ingredient of an eye- wash. Sometimes an animal will select an infusion to drink. Other... A few other substances don't fit any of the categories. Powdered spirulina (an algae) is a fantastic superfood, especially fo r dogs, regulating digestion, shoring up the immune system and providing a wealth of nutrients. Aloe vera gel is a good base for some skin preparations; beeswax for others. Water is also a vital ingredient! Animal Aromatics \u2014The Power of Self -Selection \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 9 Because of their powerful scents, essential plant oils have an affinity with treatment by inhalation - and often that's all an a nimal needs to access the substance's medicinal properties - the active ingredients pass through the nasal mucosa directly into the bloodstream, and are also taken quickly to the limbic system of the brain (this is how essential oils get their reputation fo r altering mood: see below). Sometimes the animal may want to lick a plant extract. Even then it's a different process of absorption from the action of eating, especially with essential oils as the animals tend to take them in such tiny amounts - drops rather than p alm- fuls. The substances therefore pass through the buccal and sublingual membranes of the mouth into the bloodstream before they can be swallowed. Taking substances in sufficient quantity to go through the digestive system (which sometimes happens with the macerated oils, dried extracts, and diluted essential oils) is relatively inefficient as the substance will undergo many alt era- tions by enzymes which destroy some or all of its properties before it reaches the required site. The skin is also an effective path- way for the application of essential oils - too effective for animals sometimes, as their abundance of hair follicles provides a shunt pathway into the body which can easily result in overdose. For this reason Aromatics practitioners apply topical prep ara- tions only to a specific site of affected skin they are trying to help, and then only when animals have selected them. It's n ot at all appropriate to massage oils generally into an animal's coat or to apply shampoos, etc, with a high content of an unselected o il. Over her twenty+ years of work with animals and Aromatics, and through the case studies of her students, Caroline Ingraham has found the whole discipline of facilitating self -selection to be useful for nearly all animals displaying a wide range of ill nesses and imbalances. Her work with orphaned elephants in Kenya, captive tigers, pet parrots and chameleons has shown that Animal Aromatics is not confined to domestic herbivores in its benefits - and it has been seen to help animals with: - Poor condition, including conditions related to old age; aches, sprains, arthritic complaints and movement problems; inflamma tory conditions such as laminitis; disorders; respiratory problems; infestations, like mange or and behavioural is- sues; convalescence and recovery from surgery and drug regimens. One of the most important discoveries about the exercise of zoopharmacognosy is that its safe and holistic nature means that it not only addresses any physical issues that the animal may be suffering, but also any emotional wounds, past shock or trauma, and hard -wired stress reactions that may underlie those physical issues. It's an amazing thing but Aromatics can act as a kind o f olfactory counselling for an animal. They can't speak or understand human language but they understand chemicals in the oils which allow them to calm down, open up to healing, recover self -esteem, allay fears and release the cell memories associated with past trauma. Astonishing displays of emotional release have been witnessed when an animal has been enabled to access the oil it needs, and astonishing turns around in behaviour and attitude have also been seen. Treating with Aromatics allows a great degree of owner/animal bonding ; the animal almost always responds positively to being given back the self -determination treating with Aromatics involves. Monty, a 10 year old New Forest gelding, was brought to my attention in 2007. He was pre- senting with worsening behavioural prob- lems, both around humans and with other horses. Background Monty, a 13.2 hands high, black New Forest pony, ran free on the forest for the first 7 years after his birth was registered. Then he was brought in, auctioned in the sales and broken to ride in 2004. It is not known at what age he was gelded; there is a possibility that he ran free as a breeding stallion for some or all of the 7 years. As a New Forest animal he was presumably sub- jected to the annual drifts when horses are Animal Aromatics \u2014The Power of Self -Selection \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 10 rounded up and herded into small corrals to be wormed, vaccinated etc (he may have been gelded during one such event). Whatever the truth, the transition from those years of herd life on the forest to being a more domesticated, riding horse can be presumed to have been traumatic for Monty in some degree. His last owner said that Monty was worked fairly frequently and was grazed with a herd including a number of mares; had a thr ee month turned away period; and three months in a riding school. He was then in a field with some much bigger horses. Appar- ently he was bullied by these horses and was very afraid of them. The Cruickshank family bought him in 2006 and had him for about nine months before consulting me. He was bought as a riding pony mainly for the 11 year old daughter, Chloe. He was being ridden nearly every day, though under protest, either out on th e roads or in the school; always accompanied by someone on foot. It varied as to whether he was turned out 24/7 or brought in a t night, due partly to interactions with the other three horses on the land and partly to the laminitis danger to him as a nati ve pony. He was being fed hay and one or two feeds of a cool mix/pasture mix with some garlic supplement. He was unshod, and trimmed by the farrier. He was regularly wormed, vaccinated and had his teeth checked. Symptoms Monty's owners had handling difficulties with him on and off, to a more or lesser extent, since they got him. Unpredictable was the word used to describe his behaviour. He came across as both a dominant pony, and insecure. His difficult behaviours in- cluded: - napping, spooking, pulling away when being led or going his own way when ridden, not standing still to be mounted, saddle -shyness, girth -shyness, head -shyness, bridling difficulties, nippy behaviour, invading humans' space, reluctance to have his feet picked up (with tensing/kicking), mounting mares which broke into the field, aggressive behaviour towards the geldin gs on the yard, barging through the stable door, jumping out of the school (while ridden). He often seemed uncomfortable being h an- dled with a lot of tail -swishing and laying -back of ears. His owners tried to secure lessons for him and Chloe with a BHS instru ctor but after riding him for a short while herself, the instructor refused, saying he was dangerous. However sometimes Monty seemed calm, biddable and affectionate and he seemed to have developed a bond of acceptance with Chloe (if not a whole lot of respect!). It must be said the Cruickshanks were novices to horse -owning and possibly a little tentative and Monty might benefit from more consistency and firmness. Recently Monty had got very over -assertive with the geldings in the field, constantly herdin g one and aggressively chasing off another and maybe challenging the third (the pasture alpha, but only out during the day); so much so that he had to be removed from the field for everyone's safety. From then he grazed alone in an adjoining field and seemed much more docile in this situation. Due to all this there was a concern about stallion -like tendencies in Monty. He could actually have been riggish but it seemed more likely this was wired -in behaviour stemming from his time on the forest and also a reflection of his late schooling. The owners seriously considered selling Monty, and it's true that in his current state he seemed totally unsuitable as a chil d's pony. However, they had formed too much emotional attachment to him, especially Chloe. He had recently been seen by the vet for leg pain/lameness but the vet thought it was mostly abnormal gait. No action was taken and he was not on any medication. First consultation: 10th June 2007 I decided that if Monty was co -operative I would offer of oils for emotional/behavioural issues - a wide range because the roots of the problem are hard to define. It made sense to me that Monty would probably have issues relating to past difficulties, and obvi- ously the male problems needed to be addressed though I intended to try and get a picture of whether these were a result of actual riggishness or were stemming from fear or anxiety. I was also concerned that some of Monty's angry behaviour, handling difficulties and unpredictability might be due to pain, given the history of leg pain/lameness, his reluctance to hold up his feet and his sporadic unwillingness to be ridden, so I wanted to try oils that might be indicated for possible inflammatory conditions . I offered the following oils, for the following reasons and with the following responses: - 1. Arnica macerate For opening to healing, physical and emotional bruising, inflammation Monty was interested in the smell and mouthed the bottle; he didn't want to lick any poured either into the hand or a scoop, but rubbed his muzzle in it really quite violently, grabbing the scoop in his teeth and throwing it about. An emotional release Animal Aromatics \u2014The Power of Self -Selection \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 11 2. Angelica root EO For opening to healing; comforting He was interested and took it in with distended nostrils, coming back a few times 3. Rose Otto EO For releasing past trauma; anger, resentment; inherited issues/unwanted memories He seemed very interested in this. He drank in the smell quite avidly, mouthed the bottle, rubbed his muzzle into a few drops on the hand. He looked round at the horses in the field. Then he seemed to have had enough and went back to his hay 4. Yarrow EO Also for emotional wounds; repressed anger. To give feelings of protection. Also anti - inflammatory properties . He liked this even more. Having sniffed it he was immediately keen to lick some. He licked quite a lot, neat, from my hand. He had a relieved air while he licked it, though seemed a bit desperate, biting at my hand at times. Licked with both sides of tongue. 5. Neroli EO For loss, separation, sadness . He took it in with distended nostrils for a short time. He looked round at the horses in the field. He came back a second time. Not as dramatic as the rose. 6. Linden blossom absolute Releasing heavy emotions caused by trauma/abuse . Very interested, immediately wanting to mouth the bottle; he licked some neat and rubbed his muzzle in it; he seemed a little agitated whilst being offered it. He took a while over it, looking thoughtful in between palmfuls. A definite positive reaction; there was something to be re- leased there. He let me put a dab on his poll. 7. Jasmine EO Comforting. For aggressive male dominance . Took in a lot through distended nostrils and went quite still. 8. Ylang ylang EO Also for aggressive male dominance; to instil confidence; for bullying (given or received) Similar to jasmine but a stronger reaction; took it in for longer and came back a few times. 9. Bergamot EO Balancing to the system This was the first one he really didn't seem that interested in. A cursory sniff and that was it. 10. Roman chamomile EO For anxious temperament especially displaying tense, hard muscles. He was very interested in this with a strong sniffing reaction; he mouthed the bottle, licked some neat from my hand and then had had enough. 11. Peppermint EO Lack of confidence; boredom; uplifting. Inflammation to tendons and muscles; aches and sprains. Circulatory difficulties. Nerve tonic/repair. This had a pronounced reaction, with a strong flehmen response, lots of licking and mouthing the bottle; he took a really long time savouring it in his mouth and looked rather sleepy. 12. Frankincense EO Fear Not much of a response. 13. Pink lotus absolute Balancing to the spirit Nor to this; he started wandering on his rope like he'd rather lost interest in the proceedings. Balancing oils obviously not his thing. 14. Sandalwood EO Fear He gave a cursory sniff and then turned away; didn't want a second one. 15. Marjoram EO Male hormones; aggression; excessive mounting. Also antispasmodic, warming for stiff mus- cles and joints; comforting. This had an intriguing response. It didn't seem strong at first but he did keep returning given the chance, in between going and interacting with his owners. At one point he looked at me quite angrily. He took in a lot from a quite still posture, distending his nostrils. He yawned sev- eral times and also then fed keeping his head lowered in a relaxed way. Made blowing noises. 16. Nutmeg EO Unpredictable, bargey behaviour; scattered energy. He had a cursory sniff but was not very interested. Animal Aromatics \u2014The Power of Self -Selection \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 12 17. Vetiver EO Balancing to hormonal system, calming sexual excitability and \"riggish\" behaviour. Calming, grounding, focusing . He was very interested, took in a lot through distended nostrils, kept head low. A few similar responses to Marjoram but not as strong. 18. Valerian EO Relaxing Not especially interested. 19. Vanilla absolute For irritability and nervous tension A fairly firm NO. 20. German chamomile EO Anxiety, tension. Inflamed conditions . This was a favourite. Monty smelled it and quickly started mouthing the bottle, but was not keen to lick though he still seemed interested - a response I've often seen with German chamomile so I decided to dilute some for him. I tried him out with a few base oils and he chose safflower (which itself is indicated for inflammation); I then mixed this with the essential oil. Monty was incredibly keen, licking it up with both sides of the tongue, yawning and pawing - I had to mix three lots before he was satisfied. 21. Violet leaf absolute Nervous, spooky behaviour; adjusting to change This provoked a lot of interest too with Monty quickly indicating he wanted to lick it. I mixed it in a strong solution with the safflower. However he did not lick it but violently rubbed his muzzle in it until all the oil on my hand was absorbed. Let me rub a little on his chest. 22. Seaweed absolute Impaired movement I was interested to see that while he seemed fascinated by the smell, inhaling avidly with a very surprised look on his face, he made no indication of wanting to lick. In retrospect it could be that it smelled too strong...? 23. Comfrey macerate Pulled muscles, tendons, ligaments; inflammation No interest 24. Marigold macerate Cheering Quite liked the smell but didn't want to lick 25. St John's wort macerate Relaxing/sedative; nerve pain A firm NO I tried the arnica again but it got no response. 26. Devil's claw Anti-inflammatory and analgesic Was interested in the bag but not the contents! 27. Rosehips Just as a treat and tonic Liked these very much, ate all I had. Monty seemed very relaxed after his oils and his young rider picked out his feet with no trouble. Something quite notable hap- pened then however: Mr Cruickshank was stroking Monty, and just rested his arm across his back in the saddle position. Sud- denly Monty's head was in the air, his ears back and his tail swishing. When he withdrew Monty was calm again. I felt along Monty's back and there was a place just to one side of his spine in front of the sacro -iliac where the pads of the saddle would sit where a slightly raised bump could be seen and felt. When I pressed it Monty had an immediate angry response; he kicked out with his back leg whilst turning to bite, ears back. This led me to discuss with the owners the possibility that certainly his reluctance to be girthed up and mounted, and maybe some of his other angry behaviour was stemming from pain. The leg problems could have been caused by Monty compensating in his movement for the pain in his back. As Monty hadn't been interested in the more obviously analgesic substances offered, I thought that it probably wasn't pain he was feeling all the time, which suggested that it was either a) caused by the saddle, b) some sort of strain from another cause but made uncomfortable by the saddle, or c) nerve rather than muscle/ligament pain. I suggested that both saddle and back be checked, the back by an equine bodyworker, to eliminate them as the cause of some or all of the problems; the oils I knew could help with the pain but in addition manipulation might be needed. I felt the presen ce of the inflammation could have been the reason (or at least one of them) for his keenness on the yarrow, German chamomile and peppermint and to a lesser extent the choice of safflower as a base oil (he did not select comfrey and did not take any arnic a or Animal Aromatics \u2014The Power of Self -Selection \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2009 13 seaweed orally, but it could be that the other oils did the job as far as he was concerned). I suggested that I make up a gel to apply topically to the swelling. Most of the oils I would have added to the gel Monty had already tried, but I then offered, to be sure: 28. Wintergreen Muscular aches, inflammation, analgesic He was interested, prolonged inhalation with dilated nostrils. I felt there would probably be a many -stranded solution to Monty's problems. I expressed an opinion to the owners that a guided consistent training program would probably benefit Monty and his foot balance should be looked at. What the choices told me From Monty's choices I formed the opinion that resentment and confusion caused by his earlier experiences, especially those around the time of being taken off the forest, were currently a block to his development of calm in his new situation, which he needed to clear. They led to anxiety about his handling and his position with other horses, which in turn needed to be soothe d. If this happened I believed Monty's maleness problems would be less of an issue (if they continued in spite of treatment I wou ld try Monty with a strong hormone balancer such as vitex agnus castus; and recommend he get tested for testosterone levels to find out if he is a true rig) as, if he was less anxious about herd life, he wouldn't have to try and exert so much inappro priate control. Also, there was evidently some physical inflammation, pain and/or predisposition to it through what the vet describe d as his abnormal gait (and/or saddle fitting) which may have set up a vicious circle of Monty not using himself properly, muscl es not developing as they should leading to further weakness; also him expecting pain when saddled, and therefore using dominant behaviour to try to avoid it. This could have caused some of his angry, tense behaviour, driving away of the other horses, an d handling problems. This was a chicken -and-egg thing however, as it could also be that Monty holding himself very tensely a lot o f the time CAUSED muscular discomfort. It was very noticeable that Monty held his head in the air and his neck was stiff, with overdeveloped muscles on the underside. However if the musculo -skeletal issues could be resolved in tandem with the anxiety ones, I was hoping we might see a calmer Monty. Update 1 After ten days of being offered the oils, Monty was still keeping up an interest in many of them. After a few days he phased out: angelica root, neroli, ylang ylang. His interest in vetiver waned considerably. His strongest oils were: German chamomile, Roman chamomile, peppermint and rose, with him keeping up a moderate interest in yarrow, violet leaf, jasmine and seaweed. He also took, on and off, large amounts of plain safflower oil. His use of linde n blos- som, strong at first, waned and then he became interested again. He accepted and sometimes even apparently enjoyed his topical muscle rub. There are a few things I found particularly intriguing. Monty's most consistently strong (and some medium) interest oils - the chamomiles, peppermint, safflower, yarrow and seaweed - have indications for inflammation/muscular tension. Monty stopped licking in favour of just inhaling most of these after a few days, and this coincided with him getting his muscle rub (there was a Animal Aromatics \u2014The Power of Self -Selection I left Monty's owners: Angelica root in water Rose in water Yarrow, 50% in oil Neroli in water Linden blossom, 50% in oil Jasmine in oil Ylang ylang in water Roman chamomile in water Peppermint, 50% in oil Sweet Marjoram in water Vetiver in oil German chamomile, 50% in oil Violet leaf, 50% in oil Seaweed, 50% in oil (I wanted this tried in a Rosehips dilution as he had been keen on smelling it) Some safflower oil either for mixing or to give straight An aloe -based gel with peppermint, yarrow, wintergreen and marjoram (I had no aloe at the time so this followed a few days later). I usually only leave between 3 and 10 oils. However, I believed Monty would eliminate some of the oils used for emotional is sues quite quickly and maybe make a definite choice between some that do similar things e.g. jasmine and ylang ylang, marjoram and vetiver instead. \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 14 delay at the beginning as I was waiting for supplies of aloe). A couple of days later, the pain in the back and the visible i nflamma- tion did seem to have abated and Monty was not responding so angrily to pressure in the area. However he was still defensive of approaches to the saddle area - and generally more defensive of his right side than his left; which could indicate remembered or residual pain or that he was fairly clear the saddle/being ridden was causing the problem. He would still intermittently lick the chamomiles and seaweed. A two -pronged approach was taken with Monty: treatment with the oils, and some ground training which started six days into his treatment with the oils. His starting this training coincided with his interest in all the oils waning to the point where he was inhaling rather than licking most of them; and for three days the training seemed to be going in a positive direction. However on the fourth day, apparently Monty was upset in the morning, getting agitated in the field when the other horses went out of sight; and then during his training session he was also agitated, displaying dominant behaviour and charging around. More than an hour was spent just trying to get him to settle and be calm with the trainer nearby (especially standing in the saddle area). That evening, Monty started licking all his oils again and assumed a strong in- terest where it had gone down to medium before: rose, yarrow, peppermint, sweet marjoram, German chamomile, violet leaf, seaweed, safflower all were licked, with a strong inhale (up from medium or none) for linden blossom, jasmine and vetiver. Only Roman chamomile stayed the same (always strong). He took a LOT of seaweed, peppermint, violet leaf and safflower; went sleepy after the peppermint and sweet marjoram; and enjoyed his rub. The day had obviously been a bit emotional for Monty and some old issues (with the herd, dominance etc and also fear of potentially being ridden) which had appeared more settled had come up again. Also, the charging around may have stressed his muscles again. I was especially interested in Monty's use of violet leaf; when he showed strong interest seemed to correspond fairly exactly to him having some kind of traumatic event that day. He usually showed moderate interest and inhaled it. On the fourth day of training (when he went a bit crazy) and on the day before training started - the only day during treatment when an attempt was made to saddle him - he had a strong interest in violet leaf and licked up four palmfuls. Rose and yarrow showed a similar, though not as strong, pattern. I was interested in whether the violet leaf was a response to something Monty found frightening or if he used it to help him cope with similar events that might be upcoming; or perhaps he was physically responding to the (analgesic) salicylic acid in the violet leaf; or a bit of all of these. Update 2 On the two days following Monty's training regression, his training showed a vast improvement even from what it was before. His owners noted that he was suddenly more settled. Monty was not responding to pressure in the back area indicating an easin g of pain; however he was still anxious about being saddled, rugged and, especially, mounted (remembered pain). During these two days Monty's interest in the oils dropped considerably again, with him showing very little interest at all on Day 2. The decline in interest continued for a few days. Meanwhile in his training Monty worked up to accepting a bareback pad, then a treeless sad- dle without anxiety though he remained anxious about being mounted. His old saddle was checked and found to be much too small. A body worker (physiotherapist/chiropractor) came to see Monty and established that he did have stiffness in the poll area/ne ck on the right side, an abnormality of gait possibly from the stifle of his right hind, and back pain, for which she suggested manipu- lation under sedation (at a future appointment) and continuing the ground training. She said a couple of interesting things: one was that equines put up with a lot of pain, but that for some reason pain in the neck/poll area or stifle area actually frigh tens them (I could see a link there with Monty's use of violet leaf which has both some pain relieving and fear -relieving properties: frightening pain) and makes them very defensive; another was that New Forest ponies apparently have a genetic tendency to conformational irregularities involving the stifle joint. She was quite definite that the pain would have caused at least som e of his behavioural problems. Monty took a couple of handfuls of Devil's claw (analgesic) after the visit. His feet were trimmed by a specialist barefoot trimmer. Animal Aromatics \u2014The Power of Self -Selection \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 15 A couple of days later Monty's interest in the oils had declined further. He was still having his muscle rub. He phased out r ose, yarrow, linden blossom, vetiver and safflower. Interestingly, the last time he took linden blossom was the first day after I started training him that we didn't have a training session (because I had to go to a funeral) - his owners reported that he was quite nippy and aggressive after he had had the linden blossom and making faces when approached with subsequent oils - although he then had a strong interest in jasmine that day. From then on when I went out to do training with Monty, if I sensed he was spooky, reactive or defensive (which he sometimes was) I started offering him some violet leaf absolute before we got underway with the session. He would stand and inhale it c are- fully through each nostril in turn and sometimes ask for a bit on my hand to rub his muzzle in a little. It seemed to calm an d focus him and we could recommence the session with a new sense of co -operation. It was especially helpful if he could see the saddle on the fence: dealing with his fear of anticipated pain. In conclusion Two weeks later both the chiropractor and the vet noted how much better Monty was than when they previously saw him - his muscles had softened, his behaviour when handled had improved vastly (there was now virtually no nipping or aggressive behav- iour), he was more relaxed around the other horses, he would come up to you in the field like a friendly pony, and he would s tand still to be saddled and mounted, making no fuss. He had phased out nearly all of his oils, still showing an occasional intere st in Roman chamomile (always his favourite - for anxiety and tense muscles), jasmine (comforting; for male dominance) and of course the specific occasional use of violet leaf. It had been quite a journey with Monty and had drawn in lots of other aspects of his care - training, footcare, physiotherapy, s ad- dling - but the oils were key in supporting him both emotionally and physically, and also to deciphering the messages he was trying to give.

Or perhaps you are curious to know how essential oils, natural botanicals and flower essences may add to your pet's holistic health regime. In either case, I invite you to explore the world of Aromatherapy for animals by attending classes, workshops and gathering your own research based on case studies. Anyone who seeks to expand their aromatherapy awareness while honoring their pet's keen sense of smell and sensitive systems should consider additional study in Animal Aromatics. Essential Oil safety in topical and environmental application to avoid negative reactions is a key factor when working with animals and well as people. Placing potent essential oils neat along the spinal area is not the safe way to go with regard to a pet or a per- son's health. I have reviewed the two following books in consideration of using Aromatherapy on and for Animals. The Animal Aromatics Workbook by Caroline Ingraham is a wonderful resource and a wealth of infor- mation for the pet enthusiast. NAHA Member and Director, Jennifer Hochell, has also Authored a valuable booklet titled; Aromatherapy Guide for Pets. Either of these would be an excellent addition to your Aromatherapy li- brary. Aromatherapy Guide for Pets; by Jennifer Hochell; JennScents Inc. A Compilation of JennScents Research and Recipes This 120 page Guide contains over 75 recipes divided into sections for Dogs, Cats, Horses, Llamas. The guide includes Aromath erapy His- tory, Safe Use of Essential Oils, Blending Techniques and Aromatherapy Applications. There are additional sections on 'green cleaning' your pet's environment and diet for healthy living which includes tips on Nutrition, Homeopathy and Flower Essences. Each animal's body sys- tems are highlighted to list essential oils useful for specific area health concerns such as digestive, immune system, respir atory, muscu- lar/joints and emotional balance. The section on aromatherapy for cats has a thoughtful approach to how application should be used for such a sensitive species as the feline. Recipes for feline blends include safety instructions for mist spraying blends 'around' the cat and cat bedding. Jennifer includes several interesting ingredients such as 'Nature's Fresh' which is a plant based en- zyme spray that I use often to nourish and hydrate the skin as well as drive botanicals and oils in deeper for optimum results. As enzymes are historically known to do, this spray destroys allergens, pet dander, fleas and stains (as these are made up of proteins). Other ingredients include Colloidal Silver, a natural anti -biotic useful in killing germs, and a product called pH greenzone which is a Green Powder used to balance pH and supply nutrients to the body.'

Dr. Bruce Berkowsky In June of 1973 I was teaching biology and general science in a very rough school in Brooklyn. Like many people who eventually became practitioners of the natural healing arts, I am driven by a strong Tubercular miasm current. Thus, like a fire -horse straining at the reins, my soul yearned to be out in Nature among the wild plants, animals, trails and streams. Tubercular Miasm The main themes of the Tubercular miasm include a feeling of being oppressed with a need to break free to avoid dying . In the success state of this miasm, there may be significant creativity --a compulsion to work hard in order to break free of oppression . But in the failed state, the individual is burnt out and consumed with defeatism. The feelings of the Tubercular miasm includ e: caught and suffocating; compressed; the gap is narrowing; time is running out. In my case, Brooklyn's hard -edged congestion and sedimentary grime oppressed me. Oddly, even though I grew up in the asphalt jungle, I only felt truly at home in Nature. The demands of teaching in a tense, inner city school raised my Tuberc ular miasm feelings to a fever pitch. When the last week of school finally arrived, I already had my camping gear and supplies sorted and packed. Two days after th e end of the term, I whistled my golden retriever into the back of my Chevy station wagon, climbed into the driver's seat and headed west. It wasn't until after I had passed through gritty, industrial New Jersey and entered rural Pennsylvania that I t ook my first deep breath of free air. I was no longer caught and suffocating. Time was no longer running out. My clock had been re- wound. Mangas Colorado My traveling partner that summer was my dog Mangas Colorado. At the time I got him, I was studying a great deal about the cul- ture and history of the Plains and Rocky Mountain Indian tribes. This dog had huge paws and an eager athleticism that inspire d me to name him after a renowned Apache war chief. In the mid -19th century, John Cremony, author of Life Among The Apaches, described this great warrior. He writes: \"Mangas Colorado, or Red Sleeves, was, undoubtedly, the most prominent and influential Apache who has existed for a century. Gifted with a large and powerful frame, corded with iron -like sinews and muscles, and possessed of far more than an ordinary amount of brain strength, he succeeded at an early age, in winning a reputation unequaled in his tribe.\" My dog Mangas was unusually large, athletic and strong. As it turned out, he became a fearsome warrior. Like most golden re- trievers, he was a loveable teddy bear when interacting with humans. However, when a potential male -dog rival arrived on the scene, Mangas immediately established who was top dog. He was an absolutely fearless fighter. When I got home from work, Mangas and I would run 3 miles. I would drive to the last open fields in Canarsie, the Brooklyn neighborhood where I grew up, and still lived. Situated about 50 yards from the Atlantic Ocean, this undeveloped area consist ed of several square miles of open fields and cattail marshes from which redwing blackbirds called back and forth. Until I left New York for good in 1976, this wild area sustained me. On cold winter days while Mangas scouted around, I would build a fire in the shelter of some tall hedges and watch the Atlantic weather move across the sky. One afternoon as Mangas and I walked from the sidewalk down a narrow trail into the fields, we heard some growling. I looked to my left and emerging from among the cattails was a pack of about eight feral dogs. This was not a welcome sight. We were badl y outnumbered and there were no big sticks lying around to use for defense. ARCHETYPAL IMAGES, JUNIPER OIL And COWBOY JACK \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 19 Only a few seconds had passed before an additional growling sound began. It was Mangas, hackles raised, walking stiff -legged and menacingly toward the pack. For a few heartbeats, the ferals got ready to rumble: baring teeth, growling in concert and e dg- ing forward. Then as Mangas, utterly undeterred, kept coming, they one by one turned and trotted off until only the biggest, toughest one was standing alone to face Mangas as he kept moving forward with serious intent. The wild dog made a quick as- sessment of the situation, then tucked his tail between his legs and disappeared into the marshes. We never saw the pack agai n. Ostensibly, I was Mangas' master. However, it's safe to say I was in awe of that dog. He was the kind of dog that made a Broo k- lyn boy swell with pride and feel a lot safer both when trekking through wild country and along mean streets. Yarrow Oil and the Warrior -Type There are many essential oils that may be relevant for a warrior -type individual. Leading among these, and the first one to co me to my mind regarding Mangas, is yarrow. Yarrow ( Achillea millefolium ) is named for the Greek hero Achilles who used the herb to treat his wounded soldiers during the siege of Troy. In fact, yarrow was used in this capacity up to and through the American Civil War. Achilles, who was predispo sed by his mother from birth to play the role of hero, chose to live a short, glorious life rather than a long, uneventful one. I n ancient Rome, yarrow was dedicated to the spilling of blood in honor of Mars, the god of war. Also, yarrow has a rich tradition for t he treatment of wounds inflicted by weapons and was once referred to as military herb or soldier's wound wort. Yet there is a unique polarity in yarrow in that it also has a soft, yielding side to its nature for which its many soft, finely branched le aves are a prominent signature. Juniper Trees and a Place of a Vanished People That summer, Mangas and I camped in wild places all across the country: the Midwest, Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, South- west, California coast and the Pacific Northwest. On the return leg of our journey, after a long drive on a warm August day, we pulled in at a small, dusty camping area with only a few rough -hewn picnic tables and fire pits. I backed the Chevy under a fair ly large juniper tree, its branches heavy with berries, and set up camp there. (Interestingly, a juniper berry is the female see d cone. It takes about 18 months to fully mature, and it's not a true berry but rather a cone with unusually fleshy, merged scales th at lend it a berry -like appearance.) The few other campsites were empty, except for one. Tucked into a corner under another sizeable juniper tree was a small, old trailer --the kind that hooks onto a hitch on the rear bumper of a truck or car. This one appeared to have been built in the 40s or 50s. Its white paint was dull and chipped, the outward -facing side -window had a weary looking, angled Venetian blind pulled all the way down, slats closed. There was no vehicle parked by it. The trailer did not have the air of camping trip about it. I nstead, it had a look of shabby permanence. The whole place radiated a melancholy energy that seemed to emanate from long ago. It was like a ghost town where one could feel, rather than hear, echoes from the past. I called to Mangas and we followed a trail out of the camping area on to an ope n plateau populated only by scattered junipers and sagebrush. I couldn't shake the psychic perception of historical desolation and abandonment. Previously that summer I had spent time in the Black Hills of South Dakota, sacred ground of the Lakota (Sioux) tribes. I cou ld feel the presence of despairing ghosts there. I felt that same presence here in dry Idaho country. I felt certain this was an cient tribal land, perhaps Shoshone. The difference here was that, unlike the Black Hills, there weren't any dense forests to buffe r one's encounter with inhabitant spirits. This was a place of stark, rough terrain populated by patches of sagebrush and indiv idual junipers who kept their distance from each other. The ground was reddish -brown hardpan that sounded like a mixture of dry soil and ground glass when trod upon. To my left was a deep ravine out of which rose a rugged, barren red hillside. It was one of those cloudy days when the clouds are not deline ated and the grayness is backlit by a preternatural luminescence. ARCHETYPAL IMAGES, JUNIPER OIL And COWBOY JACK \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 20 After we had walked no more than 50 yards, I looked upward and saw two buzzards circling about 100 feet above us, wings out- spread, floating on a thermal. This added to my sense of unease. I noted that Mangas wasn't showing his usual eagerness to ru n around after the long drive. Instead, he walked closely by my side. I had no desire to walk any farther and so turned back to ward our camp. Mangas concurred and trotted back to camp with alacrity. He had the great nose of a hunting dog and must have picked up the scent of ghosts. Open juniper woodlands such as this one serve as watersheds in dry country and are important ranges for wildlife, especially deer and songbirds. But that day, aside from the buzzards, I saw no animal life nor heard any bird utter a sound. The silence was eerie and pervasive. Juniper is considered to be a protective oil which supports the spirit during challenging situations. It encourages inner vis ions and facilitates trances such as those that characterized the Native American spirit quest. Juniper is also one of the herbs burnt by Tibetans as a means of driving off evil spirits. Too, various American Indian tribes used juniper to treat wounds. Cowboy Jack When Mangas and I returned to camp, I heard the door of the trailer open. I turned and saw a middle -aged man in Western garb step out and move about his campsite. He was perhaps in his late 50s or 60s. When he turned in my direction, I waved and he nodded back. After a minute or two, he reentered his trailer and shut the door. He had been inside there all along. He clearly didn't have a vehicle, and I realized then that he actually lived in this deso late place. I had the feeling that he had been watching us through the gaps of his window blind and now had taken the opportunity to announce his presence to the visitors to his home -ground. It was now late afternoon, so I started preparing my supper and getting ready for nightfall. I walked around the area and gat hered pieces of long -dried juniper wood that lay like old bison bones amid the sagebrush and got a fire going. By the time I had finished dinner and fed Mangas, night had fallen. Like a lot of members of the Woodstock generation, I had taken up guitar. I taught myself how to play some chords and traditional finger -picking patterns. Aside from the crackle of the fire and the sound of Mangas chewing on a stick of firewood, the place was still totally silent, so I got out my guitar to fill th e void. I was sitting on a picnic table bench and had played through a few of the simple tunes I was able to play with some degree of competence when I heard the trailer door open. I didn't see Jack until he walked out of the darkness into my small circle of fire- light. He was dressed in a clean white Western -style shirt, neatly pressed jeans with a large brass belt buckle and polished cow- boy boots, all topped with a new -looking white cowboy hat. (In general, the juniper -type tends toward neatness of appearance.) He had the appearance of someone who had just stepped out of an old -style hotel like you see in movie westerns. He was neatly shaven and I could pick up the scent of aftershave tinctured with whisky. He had the raw beefsteak complexion and glazed corneas of the serious drinker. I stood and we shook hands and introduced ourselves. I'm Jack, he said. I invited him to have a seat and we sat in silence a bit with Mangas curled up by the fire, his golden coat glowing in its li ght and burning juniper wood scenting the air. Then, he asked me to play some songs. I was a bit hesitant as, at best, I was a medioc re guitarist. Nevertheless, I proceeded to play and sing the traditional folk -blues songs I knew, such as Midnight Special and Hous e Of The Rising Sun, figuring this was the genre most suitable for this particular audience. He was silent throughout my performance. I didn't know whether he liked the music or was just politely waiting for me to quit . As the old saying goes: Beggars can't be choosers. There wasn't exactly a line of professional musicians lining up to play this venue. After a few songs, I put down the guitar and we began to talk. I told him I was a science and biology teacher from New York C ity. ARCHETYPAL IMAGES, JUNIPER OIL And COWBOY JACK \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 21 He looked at me as if I'd said I just landed from Saturn. I asked him about his life and he described his many years working on ranches, herding cows, mending fence, etc. With the wonder of a Brooklyn boy who had grown up watching old black and white westerns on rainy weekend afternoons, I couldn't help thinking: By golly, Im sitting and talking with a real live cowboy. Jack had the quiet voice and withdrawn manner of a man who had spent much of his life alone, doing hard and often dangerous physical labor. Like this place where he chose to live, his essence was infused with loss, regret and loneliness. There is a song (relevant regarding Jack) that goes: Half my life I can't remember, the other half I can't forget. Neither one of us liked talking about ourselves too much, so after a while the conversation petered out and we bid each other goodnight. I watched the juniper fire burn down and then got into my sleeping bag with Mangas settling down by my side. It ha d been a long day. Looking Back and the Sycotic Miasm The next morning at daybreak, I ate a quick breakfast and stowed my gear in the station wagon. Unbidden, Mangas leapt into th e back. This was his way of saying: Start this car and step on it. I shifted into first gear and rolled slowly out of the camping area. I looked in my rearview mirror and saw the battered old trailer for the last time. There was no sign of Jack. I had a lot of unique experiences that summer but only a few have stayed so vividly chronicled in my memory. It wasn't until 25 years after I had my encounter with Jack --when I was writing the Juniper chapter for my Synthesis Materia Medica/Spiritualis of Essential Oils --that I realized Jack was an archetypical Juniper individual, and it was no coincidence that he chose to live under a juniper tree. It should be noted that the juniper type does not necessarily have a history of significant alcohol use. In some cases, the j uniper- type, while not particularly drawn to alcohol, reports that his father or mother were heavy drinkers. The parent sometimes ac tually preferred gin. In other cases, there is no personal or family history of alcohol abuse. However, juniper has an historical association with alcohol as it has long been used as a flavoring ingredient in gin. The na me gin is derived from the Dutch word jenever which means juniper. It is used in Sweden to make a variety of beer. Also, juniper oil is sometimes used to help an individual to overcome addictions. The juniper alcoholic tends to be non -violent, melancholy, morose and withdrawn. When the juniper -type drinks, the alcohol does not fuel rage, but rather, helps to sustain his need for withdrawal from life's relentless assaults. The juniper alcoholic cr aves a barroom's sheltering darkness and quietness and is moved by the songs of pain and loss coming from its jukebox. Looking back now, I can see why my instincts led me to play folk -blues when Jack called for a song. Juniper is associated with the Sycotic miasm, a keynote is secretiveness . The juniper patient's Sycotic secretiveness is not so much motivated by an inherent secretiveness as by a yearning to withdraw or retreat from life's stressful challenges a nd to build a fort around deep -seated fears and emotional wounds, weaknesses and weariness. The hiding of the juniper -type is a strategic retreat, a self -imposed isolation due to the feeling that one is misunderstood a nd unsupported by others. In concert with this desire to withdraw, a type of aloofness due to acquired skepticism, cynicism, los s of social confidence and an inability to place trust in themselves or others should guide the blender to juniper oil. The Key Difference Between Juniper and Thuja closely occidentalis ), another major Sycotic oil. There are some similarities between these two oils yet they are also quite different in many ways, and one is readily distinguishable from the other. Juniper lacks thuja's intense deceptive quality. The secretiveness of thuja is one that is colder and more calculating. ARCHETYPAL IMAGES, JUNIPER OIL And COWBOY JACK \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 22 Whereas the shame and hiddenness of thuja derives from acts that the thuja individual has personally committed, these same qualities in the juniper -type are generally due to acts committed by others with whom they are closely linked. The juniper -type tends to be the witness or victim rather than the perpetrator. For instance, while the thuja -type may feel shame about committin g adultery, the juniper -type feels shame because her father or husband committed adultery. The case history of the juniper -type commonly features a pattern of sexual misconduct by a family member. Juniper is a specific for the Sycotic individual who, though secretive, tends to be gentle and sensitive. The \"Feeling\" of Juniper My purpose in writing this piece is to convey the feeling of juniper oil. Juniper oil and Cowboy Jack have become inseparab le in my mind. Most likely he is gone now. Alcoholics living alone in battered trailers are not ideal candidates for living to a ri pe old age. Perhaps he has joined the other spirits that inhabit that place where we met. If so, I hope their company comforts him.

Q: Do you have any information on diluting essential oils for bathing a dog or cat? -Thanks, Shawn Dear Shawn, Thanks for contacting NAHA for information regarding essential oils for bathing dogs and cats. Please check out this web -link below to the Aromatherapy Safety webpage which includes posted information from Caroline Ingraham 'author' of Animal Aro- matics. Also a helpful book and website is Kristen Leigh Bell's Holistic Aromatherapy for Animals www.aromaleigh.com http://www.naha.org/pdf/Aromatherapy_for_Animals_Safety_Page.pdf There is a much debate in the aromatherapy world about use of essential oils with animals. Most data to this point shows to avoid use with cats and birds due to their highly sensitive systems. Essential oils have been used in diluted formulas for topic al application and environmental diffusion for dogs and horses. In regards to 'bathing' it can be difficult to give a generic response due to the fact that essential oils do not mix with wa ter unless the essential oils chosen are diluted in a natural shampoo base. Just using essential oils alone (non -diluted) in water would be too strong for animals (and most people) as well as could cause skin sensitivities. Once you choose a specific essential oil based o n the animals needs you could try to incorporate that with a shampoo base to see how that works for that individual animal. Eac h animal (like people) have individual health issues and some can be highly sensitive to essential oils as well as other topica l prod- ucts such as even a base shampoo. Work with a professional aromatherapist to find the correct dilution method along with the animal's owner and veterinarian (esp. if the animal has any health issues) when working with pure essential oils. On a personal note, I have used essential oils for over 20 years working with people and their animal friends, in particular our own horses and dogs. I have seen one of my dogs have a severe allergic reaction to Tea Tree essential oil (which is a very co m- mon essential oil that seems to be in many topical application bases). K. Bell's book has a section dedicated to safety issue s with Tea Tree. And yet I have used diluted Tea Tree with no negative reactions with my horses when used for topical application to minor scrapes or bug bites. Many pre -made blends can be very useful for animals, however working with each animal individu- ally prior to choosing a blend can also rule out if the animal will be hyper -sensitive to any of the essential oils. I don't bathe my dogs that often (as that washes away their natural oils, yet when I have bathed them I use a special oatmeal shampoo from our vet, I don't add any essential oils) I have used diluted mist sprays which contain 'hydrosols' (the left -over a ro- matic waters from when the plant material has been distilled) these can be very useful for mist spraying the animal's coat and as an environmental mist spray. I have used Dr. Bronner's natural soap base with a few drops of essential oils for my horses when given their summer time bath to help with fly bite reactions, Lavender and Rosemary 2 drops each diluted to 1/4 cup natural soap base which is then added to a bucket filled with warm water. So that is 'very' dilute for such a large animal as a horse. I've also used Geranium (few drops) in a bathing blend for our mare during her in -season time. I hope this information is helpful, please feel free to email if you have any additional questions or need more information.

In it she sets out the philosophy of Animal Aromatics, before embarking on a comprehensive guide to the essential oils, macerated oils, dried herbs and minerals frequently selected by animals; the body systems for which they are useful; animals' responses; and how to offer. There are species -specific sections dealing with common ailments and the oils that could possibly help; and Nick Thompson BSc (Hons), a renowned holistic vet, has contributed a section on nutrition. The cross -referencing makes it an easy book to use. All in all it is an inspirational volume and an essential addition to the book- shelf of all animal owners, or anyone interested in animals and their natural management or the health -enhancing properties of plants. I treated my own animals for a couple of years with its help and guidance before training with Caroline - but even now I'm quali- fied and practising professionally, a day doesn't pass when I don't open this book to refer to something or be reassured by C aro- line's experience and wisdom. It's one of the most battered books on my shelf!

Recipes and Reviews \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 25 When I started learning about essential oils and their therapeutic uses in 2003, one of my first uses of essential oils was with mice. I lived near open fields in Oklahoma and the mice wanted to come in for the winter. I researched that topic and made up a blend to deter them from coming in the house. The blend included and baseboards, waited three days sprayed again and then waited one week and sprayed one last time. I did not have any mice that winter. I then moved on to treat ant hills in the summertime with Peppermint essential oil. I was amazed at how well the oils worked. When I came across Caroline Ingraham's The Animal Aro- matics Workbook' everything seemed to come together for me. Her main message is let the animals choose, don't force a rem- edy on them. In perfect timing, as I was still reading and learning about Caroline's method I came across an invitation to a three day seminar she was teaching in Atlanta, Georgia. After spending the weekend there, I knew I was hooked. What could be better than to combine my two absolute loves, animals and aromatherapy? It couldn't get any better than that for me. I started her d i- ploma course in 2006. I have been to Wales and London for instruction under Caroline. I am currently finishing up the diploma course. Part of Caroline's diploma course includes documenting twelve case studies. Here are two of the studies I have done. Case Study #1: 5 lb Chihuahua Female 2 years old, Sweet Pea One night I went to feed my dogs and Sweet Pea didn't show up. This was unusual; she never missed an op- portunity for food. I found her in her bed. I coaxed her to eat 10 to 12 kibble but she regurgitated it after about 20 minutes. She was very lethargic and when I held her she felt weak. I left her in her bed for the night. The next morning she was still not interested in eating. I left her breakfast next to her bed. She ate a few kibble and stayed in bed. By noon she was looking very poorly, tail between her legs, ears down, too weak to stand. I offered her several essential oils including Peppermint (M entha piperita but all elicited response. When I offered Bitter Almond ( Prunus dulcis var. amara) there was a definite yes'. Note: This essential oil has had the prussic acid (cyanide) removed. I then needed to find a carrier oil for her. I offered of I offered the Sweet Almond ( Prunus dulcis ) she wanted it. Due to her small size, I mixed \u00bd a drop of the essential oil with 3 ml of the base oil. I offered it to her on my hand. She took two licks and was finished. About 15 minutes after her remedy she looked better and wanted me to hold her. After about 4 hours you would have never known she was ill. I was surprised at how quickly Sweet Pea went from appearing to need emergency care to being completely fine with no ill effects what so ever. Case Study #2: 20 lb Feline, Male 3 years old, Hyde Hyde is my son's cat. Twenty four hours prior to my seeing him he had his front claws removed. He was still bleeding and in a lot of pain. When I arrived Roger had Hyde on his bed in a carrier. It was obvious that the cat was in a lot of pain and wasn't going to put up with a lot of fuss. The essential oils I chose to have Hyde experience were: Angelica Root ( Angelica archangelica ), to open him up to the healing process. After inhaling for about a minute, he was finished with this oil. Rose ( Rosa damascena ), to help with any trauma. He spent some time inhaling this oil and then did not want any more. Chamomile, German ( Matricaria recutita ), for its anti -inflammatory Animal Studies By Lisa Davis RA \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 26 properties. There was a no response. Next came Neroli ( Citrus aurantium ). He was not interested in this oil. Frankincense ( Boswellia carteri ) was my next choice for fear and he was very happy with this oil. Carrot Seed ( Daucus carota ) was next because he was still bleeding 24 hours after surgery. Hyde was happy to inhale it for a few minutes and then wanted a break. Next was Seaweed ( Fucus vesiculosus ) but this was a definite no. I wanted to try something to help with his physical and emotional wounds so I offered Yarrow ( Achillea millefolium ). It wasn't his favorite but he didn't turn from it either. Due to his bruising and trauma I felt Helichrysum (Helichrysum angustifolium ) was a good choice, Hyde didn't agree with me. Last I offered him Aloe ( Aloe barbadensis ) as a base and he was fine with that. This was the only base I tried with Hyde because I felt with its strong healing properties this was the best choice and he was starting to get agitated. Final Remedies: I used Aloe gel with Yarrow and Carrot Seed essential oils to apply to Hyde's paws. As I applied the oils, my son Roger was amazed that Hyde let me touch them. Up until now Hyde wouldn't let Roger come close to his paws. I also made up a bottle of Frankincense for Hyde to inhale as needed. Final Outcome: The next morning Roger applied the Aloe remedy. Hyde didn't want the Frankincense. In the evening he didn't want any remedies. Roger said he looked great and the bleeding had stopped. Hyde was finished with his remedies. He only wanted two applications. It seems that he just needed a little boost to get him on his way to healing and he was fine after that. Roger was amazed at how quickly Hyde- recovered after experiencing the remedies. These are just two of the many case studies I have done. Time and time again I am amazed at how well the oils and herbs work with the animals. When we accept our role as a conduit to offering the animals wha t they would naturally seek in the wild if given the chance, it is truly amazing to see the healing that takes place.

Animal Aromatics \u2014Case Studies \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 27 ...Grieve not, nor speak of me with tears, but laugh and talk of me as if I were beside you...I loved you so -twas Heaven here with you.-Isia Paschal Richardson By Kelly Holland Azzaro RA CCAP LMT Most of us have or will experience a deep level of grief and sadness through the loss of a loved one's passing as they make t heir transition to spirit. When this happens you may feel you were prepared for the process from prior experience or because you i ntui- tively felt a shift in your loved ones energy or health. Or you may have been totally unprepared about how to deal with so ma ny different emotions. For most of us it is the latter. Even past experience with the ebb and flow of emotional upheaval during such a life-changing event truly cannot take away any of the pain on all levels that deep loss brings. The loss I am writing about is t he loss of a beloved animal friend; one that touches our lives so deeply that words cannot express how hard it feels to loose your be st friend. Many books are available on the subject of death and dying, grief and the grieving process. You may feel inclined to read suc h a book after time has passed and you once again feel like doing something instead of just being sad and depressed all the time. Yet when you begin to read you may find your mind wandering and unable to focus on the turning pages as your thoughts ebb and flow. Your heart aches emotionally and physically for your loved one's physical presence. So the book goes back to the book s helf for awhile. You are not ready to read the how -to of saying goodbye to a beloved friend. As you grab another tissue, wipe your ey es and let out a big sigh you wonder is this a natural part of the grieving process or if you should be able to move through thi s more quickly. Yes, it is natural and yes you will be able to move through the experience and have a deeper level of awareness. Each part of the grieving process is exactly how it should be for that person at that time. So what is one to do if it seems impossi- ble to move out of such a deep sadness? Denial and repression are not the way...your grief and sadness are real! Try talking about it with loved ones and friends, seek out a professional counselor who specializes in grief, share your feelings with ot her peo- ple who have experienced the loss of their animal friend. This type of support system can be an invaluable tool for people wh o feel that their pets have graced their lives in the same way as children, guardian angels, soul -friends, or best friend! I myself feel this way and have been hurt by those who say careless remarks like It's just a dog. Get over it, or Stolen h orses- well can't you buy two more? Words can feel like a punch to the very seat of your solar plexus, initiating a very intense in ternal response that floods your body with negative chemical reaction -similar to the fight for flight defense mechanism. Once this rele ase of adrenaline and hormones get going you may find yourself in a defensive mode, or crying, with an open flood -gate of up and down emotions. I chose to surround myself with caring people and best yet, with loving animal friends. It's not necessary to rush out and adopt a new pet to replace your lost friend. They really can't be replaced. Instead take time to heal and space to ho nor your best friend. In time and healing there may well come a day when a loving animal presents themselves to you. Receive this gift when you are ready. You can use essential oils to help you ease your grief and also to reconnect with a loved one. What was their favorite aroma? Did you ever make them a blend? If so, re -create the blend and use it for personal anointment, meditation and reflection. Diffuse th eir favorite essential oil aroma and allow the scent to transport you to a loving place where you and spirit can meet. If you did not have the opportunity to create a blend or know what their favorite aroma was try tapping into their energy by asking in medit ation for guidance toward which aroma to work with. Did they love apple pie or tend to an herbal garden? If so perhaps inhaling a d rop of cinnamon or herbaceous rosemary on a tissue will easily connect you with that loving memory. You may be pleasantly sur- prised by what you experience. Keep a journal and write about your process and include a picture of your loved one/s. Write a poem from the heart. My husban d has written a few very delightful poems about our fur angels, Maxine and Tao Kitty both still with us on the physical plane. I hope he will feel moved to do the same for the babies who have transcended, especially Teddy. Teddy was our devoted dog who just recently passed away in October 2007. He had followed my husband Marco, the Pied Piper of dogs, home one day. Picture this tough street dog who adopted us, dancing to music and carrying a stuffed animal toy around the house like he was caring for a baby. By sharing a memory like that, I have now tapped into that memory. Coping with the loss of beloved animal friend - the ebb and flow of the grieving process \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 28 I can harness the good' feeling of sharing with others and move forward, away from the sadness of missing my big furry loyal friend. An Aroma -essence type blend can be used as an anointment for you and your animal friend. We anointed Teddy and his burial area. I also anointed his collar that I have placed near his picture along with special items that keep the spiritual connect ion open: quartz crystals from our own North Carolina Mountain trails and a handmade herbal bundle made of organic rosemary, lavender and sage. These herbs were harvested from our garden where Teddy frequently took pleasure in inhaling the fresh herbal aro- mas. Eucalyptus leaves as an offering from our farm family were gently placed within the handmade sage wand. Teddy's favorite baby toy was anointed and placed with him. We kept a few of his other favorites toys and gave some toys to the loving barn do gs whom were a part of our canine -support system, Magic, Botox (aka Bo Jangles), Cujo and Tiny Tim. Teddy's companion Maxine is mama's heart', one of those lifetime' dogs. Those of you who understand that type of bond will resonate. For those who don't, if you open your heart to allow being in the presence of animal spirit you will never be the s ame. They touch you so profoundly and it's hard to express how this unique relationship taps into an ancient part of you -- the anima . Maxine was present at Teddy's passing -she placed her head in my lap and we both wept. For a long time, she would not leave my side and made little whimpers as she stood over Teddy's body. A few months prior to Teddy's passing Maxine had been diagnosed with diabetes and Teddy was by her side more so then ever. He seemed to be watching her especially when they would be in the back yard together, being her seeing eye' companion. Littl e did we know at the time that Maxine's eyesight was changing most likely due to the diabetes. Since Teddy's transition, she ha s developed slight cataracts (is this from the diabetes...probably...but we also feel it could be from the intense grief and her wi t- nessing his transition, not wanting to see' her companion go). Maxine continues to move thru her grief as she helps us to do the same. Her health is stabilized with insulin injections twic e a day and a healthy home made diet which includes herbs and supplements as well as daily Medical Qigong Therapy, flower essences and homeopathy. We are also trying a natural form of eye drops that are touted as being helpful in dissolving cataracts in pe ople and humans. She actually is seeing' better and has even adapted herself to a tactile walkway by using the throw rugs and out er stone tile areas for maneuvering in and out of the house. You'd never know there was an eyesight issue unless we told you. So is it the insulin intervention, natural diet and herbal supplements or is it her moving through her grief or is it a bit of both . This is something to consider when you take the holistic path' to health of mind -body -spirit for you and your animal friends. With working with aromatherapy -flower essence like the blends listed below, it could be quite useful to have a blend pre -made ahead of time. Because when already in a very sensitive and emotional time a time, you may not be in the right state of mind to choose which essence or blend to use. Though we never want to think we will loose a loved one, it is part of life, so while c reating a pre -blend can feel odd, the creative process is a time to harness the positive feelings of joy and happiness of being in the p re- sent with your loved one. You can also create a special blend based on their essence of being; Teddy's blend was based on es- sential oils and flower essences helpful for grief, sadness, despair and fear. We honored his great protector spirit and inne r puppy joy by choosing two of our and his favorite essential oils; Frankincense and Neroli. Teddys Transition Blend: Essential Oils and Flower Essences (for you and your animal friends) Base carrier: Jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) or Aloe Vera gel (Aloe bar- badenis). Blend can also be created as a mist spray with hydrosols instead of essential oils. Or mix essential oils with sea salts and dried lavender buds for a healing bath salt soak or salt purification ceremony. Coping with the loss of beloved animal friend - the ebb and flow of the grieving process \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 29 Pure Essential Oils: In TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) grief is associated with the lung meridian channel. Lung health issues can range from clinical symptoms such as upper respiratory infections and allergies and unresolved emotional blocks such as long term grievi ng. Several of the essential oils chosen are based on Chinese Medicine Theory and balancing of Mind -Body -Spirit Connection. Angelica (Angelica archangelica): The botanical name resonates in my heart as an aroma that would accompany one of the Arch Angels written about in ancient texts as spiritual guardians, protectors and warriors of the heavens. I have found the aroma to be useful when working with people who have difficulty opening up' and the emotions they have been feeling are manifesting phys i- cally in muscular aches and pains, headaches, tension, anxiety and stress. Referenced in medieval and renaissance herbals as Angels herb or the Root of the Holy Spirit (1) Cypress ( Cupressus sempervirens ): Ancient Greeks and Romans planted Cypress trees in their burial ground sites . (2) Dr. Bruce Berkowsky's Phyto -Spiritual Essencing (PSE) writings include Cypress as one of the main essential oil remedies for grief. At one time it was purported to aid in transition of the spirit from this world to the next. Battaglia's Complete Guide to Aromather apy listed references Susanne Fischer -Rizzi: Cypress for uncontrollable crying spells and for strengthening the nervous system by restoring calm. He lists Patricia Davis reference to Cypress for times of transition' and bereavement'. Eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus globulus ): When I think of Eucalyptus the first thought that comes to mind is breathing'. Profound crying, deep sighs and roller -coaster weeping is usually accompanied by imbalanced breathing. Either holding one's breath or shallow breathing when crying can sometimes bring on waves of anxiety, coughing and fatigue. Just one drop of Eucalyptus can be use- ful in allowing you to find your breathing rhythm for balanced inhalation and exhalation of lung qi (chi). Frankincense ( Boswellia carterii ): Frankincense with its ancient aroma often used as incense for spiritual cleansing and purifica- tion. If I were to choose one essential oil to work with grief, sadness and wanting to open a spiritual connection for intui tive com- munication I would choose Frankincense. Lavender ( Lavender angustifolia ): Useful for grief, sadness, anxiety and disturbed sleep. Insomnia is often experienced during the grieving process. This essential oil can help you and your grieving animal friends to be more at peace. Neroli (Citrus aurantium var. amar): A favorite of ours and Teddy's, this is one of the main essential oils that all our animal friends have become acquainted with. The sweet, tender, loving aroma offers a special way for us to connect with our beautiful babies . Flower Essences for transition blend: (for you and your animal friends) Flower essence drops can be placed in water to drink or mixed with an aromatherapy blend to apply topically or as a spray mis t. Follow directions on flower essence labels. Rock Rose (Intense feelings of panic and fear about what is happening) Star of Bethlehem (after effect of trauma, fright, sorrow) Sweet Chestnut (extreme mental anguish, feeling alone) Walnut (aids in change') transitioning from body to spirit is a big change' on all levels. While going through the many ups and downs that accompany the grieving process we used the following flower essences for emotional support. We also gave the Bach Flower Blend; Rescue Remedy\u00d3 to our dog Maxine to help her before, during and after the transition of her best friend, Teddy. Flower Essences: helpful for after -shock and grieving process Gentian (Discouraged, despondent) Gorse (Hopelessness, despair, pessimism) Oak (Exhausted but struggles on) Pine (feelings of guilt) I took this remedy off and on when I would have thoughts like what if I had done this, what if I ha d done Coping with the loss of beloved animal friend - the ebb and flow of the grieving process \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 30 that -- then Teddy would still be alive'. I had a lingering sense of guilt and sadness. Star of Bethlehem (after effect of trauma, fright, sorrow) Flower Essences can be added to your aromatherapy blends to create an aroma -essence' anointment. Crystal and gemstone elixirs can also be included based on the vibrational properties of each stone. When I create an aroma -essence' blend I will surround the bottles with beautiful healing crystal and gemstones draped by herbal purification wands. This allows me to focus my intentions for creating the blends. This is something one can't find in a bottle it comes from the heart that wants to help others. Creating a Sacred Resting Place Ceremony; If you plan to place your animal friend's body within the sacredness of the earth, consider anointing the area with essential oils, flower essences, sage purification salts, incense, crystals, herbs, flowers and your animal friend's favorite toy. Planting Forget -Me-Not flower seeds or other flowers is a beautiful way to enjoy the beauty that blossoms from this special resting place. Plant a few fresh parsley herbs as a protection boarder or at the corner of each direction, east, west, north and south. Ancient Greek funeral ceremonies included the use of parsley placed on graves and woven into ceremonial wreaths. Creating a sacred resting place for your beloved animal friend allows the space and time for healing to occur. It will be a special place to visit, share memories and allow the grieving process to unfold. Many people choose to have their pet's bodies cremated and honor their spirit by keeping their ashes in a ceremonial urn. This can be pla ced in an area dedicated in a similar manner by surrounding the urn with flowers, crystals, sea shells (if you both loved the oce an) and a beautiful photograph of your friend. Inside a thoughtful sympathy card sent to us by our good friend, holistic veterinarian Maggie Federhart was a packet of Forg et- Me-Not' seeds to plant near Teddy's resting place and a copy of The Rainbow Bridge'. I share the poem below hoping it brings peace to your heart. The Rainbow Bridge There is a bridge connecting Heaven and Earth. It is called the Rainbow Bridge because of its many colors. Just this side of the Rainbow Bridge there is a land of meadows, hills and valleys with lush green grass. When a beloved pet dies, the pet goes to this place. There is always food and water and warm spring weather. The old and frai l animals are young again. Those who are maimed are made whole again. They play all day with each other. There is only one thing missing. They are not with their special person who loved them on earth. So, each day they run and pl ay until the day comes when one suddenly stops playing and looks up. The nose twitches! The ears are up. The eyes are staring. And this one suddenly runs from the group. You have been seen, and when you and your special friend meet, you take him or her in your arms and embrace. Your face is kissed again and again and again, and you look once more into the eyes of your trusting pet. Then you cross the Rainbow Bridge together, never again to be separated. -author unknown Recommended Reading: The Animal Aromatics Workbook; Caroline Ingraham Bach Flower Remedies for Animals; Stefan Ball and Judy Howard Dr. Pitcairn's Complete Guide to Natural Health for Dogs & Cats; Richard Pitcarin DVM Four Paws Five Directions;Guide to Chinese Medicine for Cats and Dogs Cheryl Schwartz, DVM Holistic Aromatherapy for Animals; Kristen Leigh Bell Natural Healing for Dogs and Cats; Diane Stein Coping with the loss of beloved animal friend - the ebb and flow of the grieving process \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 31 http://www.flowersociety.org/Animals.htm References: Battaglia, Salavatore; The Complete Guide to Aromatherapy with Battaglia's reference to Grieve, M., A Modern Herbal.

At first all went well, but after they journeyed some distance, one of the number, Agrimony, began to be worried as to whether they were on the right path. Later in the afternoon as they went deeper into the shadows, Mimulus began to be afraid, afraid that they had lost the road. When the sun set and the shadows deepened and the night noises of the forest were heard around them, Rock Rose became full of terror and was in a state of panic. In the middle of the night when all was blackness, Gorse lost all hope and said, I can go no further; you go along, but I shall stay here as I am until death relieves my suffe rings.' Oak on the other hand, though feeling all was lost and that they would never again see the sunshine said, I shall strug- gle on to the very last', and he did in a wild way. Scleranthus had some hope but at times he suffered so from uncertainty and indecision, first wanting to take one road and almost at once another. Clematis plodded on quietly and patiently, but caring oh so little if he fell into the last sound sleep or whether he got out of the forest. Gentian at times much cheered the party, but at others fell into a state of despondency and de- pression. Others of the travelers never feared but that they would get through and in their own way wanted so much to help their companions. Heather was very sure he knew the path and wanted all the company to take his way. Chicory had now concern about the end of the journey but was full of solicitude as to whether his fellows were footsore or tired or had enough to eat. Cera to had not much confidence in his judgment and wanted to try every path to be sure they were not wrong, and meek little Centaury so wanted to lighten the burden that he was ready to carry everybody's baggage. Unfortunately for little Centaury, he generally car- ried the burden of those most able to bear their own because they called the loudest. Rock Water, all afire to help, a little depressed the party because he would criticize what they were doing wrong, and yet Rock Water knew the way. Vervain should also have known the path well enough, but although he had become a little confused, held forth at length as to the only way out of the wood. Impatiens, too, well knew the pathway home, so well that he was impa tient with those less speedy than himself. Water Violet had traveled that way before and knew the right road and yet was a little proud and a little disdainful that others did not understand. Water Violet thought them a little inferior. And in the end they all came through the forest. Now they go as guides to other travelers who have not made the journey before, and, because they know there is a pathway through, and because they know the darkness of the forest is but the shadows of the night, they walk as gentlemen unafraid', and each of the sixteen sojourners teach in their own way the lesson, the example needed. Agrimony strides along free of all care, and jests on everything. Mimulus can know no fear; Rock Rose in the darkest moments is just a picture of calm, serene courage. Gorse in the blackest night tells them of the progress they will make when the sun rises in the morning. Oak stands steadfast in the strongest gale; Scleranthus walks with perfect certainty; the eyes of Clematis are fixed with joy on the journey's end, and no difficulties or setbacks can discourage Gentian. Heather has learnt that each traveler must walk in his own way and quietly strides in front to show it can be done. Chic- ory, always waiting to lend a hand, but only when asked, and then so quietly. Cerato knows so well the little paths that lead to nowhere, and Centaury ever seeks the weakest who find their burden heavy. Rock Water has forgotten to accuse, he just spends all the time encouraging. Vervain no longer preaches but silently points the way. Impatiens knows no hurry but lingers amongst the hindmost to keep their pace; and Water Violet, more like an angel than a man, passes amongst the company like a breath of warm wind or a ray of glorious sunshine, blessing everyone. - Edward Bach 1934 \"The Story of the Travelers\" \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 33 Greetings! Since the world seems to have gone into warp speed, I'm sure I'm not alone in reporting that I am constantly on the go with a multitude of tasks and communications to attend to along with teaching, massage, aromatherapy and astrology work...hardly any time for tuning into nature and that more creative side.* I am leaning heavily on my aromatic helpers these days and find a growing number of people are asking me to make blends for personal use. Sometimes I wish our society, like ancient Egypt, had suitable aromas diffusing into the air at different t imes of the day and eve- ning to support the appropriate physical, mental and spiritual needs. How about a mass diffusion of sandalwood, clary sage, g eranium and a few others for current issues that affect us all? I have been blessed with teaching another wonderful group in my Professional Level Aromatherapy class and grateful to observe the expansion of perception the study of essential oils brings. Starting out in 1987, it amazes me at how these students receive information i n 30 weeks that it once took years to acquire. And how exciting that there is always something new to learn! This summer, I had the privilege of at tending a talk given by David Crow of Floracopeia in Asheville and meet the special essential oil from Ecuador, Palo Santo. The effect on anxiety is quick and with pro- longed inhalation, much like the euphoric intoxication of Clary Sage, but with a greater depth and spiritual aspect. I have experienced smelling the oil even when the bottle has not been opened in a while when there was a need for to use it ... but so has a client of mine w ho experienced the strong aroma of this essence during moments of anxiety even though the small 2 ml bottle she purchased had never been opened or removed from the zip lock bag and was still in her purse! David has agreed to do some article profiles for the e -journal and I do hope we wi ll be reading more about this unusual essence. The timing of Palo Santo coming to our awareness is perfect and providential. Just like the U.S., NAHA is ready for a new administration to step up and take the helm. We are looking forward to seeing ded icated Aromathera- pists come forward with inspired leadership to support the wonderful innovations brought into being by our current President and Vice President, including this e -journal format and a fantastic website and then go on to manifest current and new ideas. It has been extremely rewarding to be a part of the Board that has kept NAHA the largest and most influential organization of its kind and to see NAHA move forward i nto new areas of expression. As the way we all experience life changes, this organization must also change to meet the needs. The best is yet to come! Aromatic blessings, Shellie *Click the Cat to read my poem SHELLIE ENTEEN Update from the Director Coordinator \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 34 By Joyce Benoit It seems that in order to give Ms Truffle her due, as it is only the way she would have liked it, her story needs to be told. Truffle was born April of 1999, in Wolfeboro, NH. She was what they called a chocolate -dapple mini dachshund. She probably only weighed 6 ponds soaking wet when we first met. She actually looked like a chocolate truffle. I went to pick this little cherub up eight weeks later, and she actually walked to the car on her own and hopped right in. This is exactly how she lived her life, on the edge all the time and a companion dog before the label became the \"in thing\". Jumping up on my sofa when I was treating patients in my office, she was so sensitive to their emotions, and just so gentle when working with children. She truly understood their feelings. I bred her with a standard wire -haired dachshund when she was old enough and there were no problems with the pregnancy. It was clear very early that she enjoyed the scent of lavender as it was the scent most used at my summer home, amongst others, thanks to the dampness. She began looking very pregnant by May and June, and I was preparing to set up my summer home in Sandwich, MA, so that a room for the birthing would be ready and in place. On the 13th of July the birthing room is ready and the weather is great. Ms Truffle woke me up at 6:15 and we went immediately to the back room where I had set up a comfortable spot for her. The delivery went very well. First to arrive was Buddha Boy at 7am, then Bootsie at 7:15, Tommie at 7:25, Avalanche at 8:30, and last of all but not least ( the longest to arrive) was Percival at 1pm. Well, it wasn't too long, perhaps 2 weeks or so when it was apparent that all the puppies were favoring the same teat; and even a shorter amount of time, only days, when I noticed that they were still favoring the same teat!#!*. It was just a few days later that I noticed that her teat was starting to pull away from her belly. I quickly placed the puppies in a basket and searched for some oils, with the help from others watching the puppies. I put tea tree and lavender neat on the teat several times a day for 3 days. It was necessary to ring up the veterinarian about the food issue for the pups. Thankfully they were old enough to go on pabulum cereal. After my puppies appointment with the vet, he was very quick to tell me \"You need to cut this out or you will kill my business\". We still remember that time with much laughter. It is now seven years later, and Ms Truffle came down quite ill one October day. It appeared she was in need of immediate medical attention. After many weeks of tests, treatments, eye drops and other medica- tions; I found out that she had renal failure. Ultimately I had a devastating follow -up meeting with the vet, only to discover that she also had Lyme Disease! I could have fallen to the floor and to this day I don't know how I didn't. I rang up my Chinese practitioner and asked for his help. Over the next 5 weeks we tried everything. Of course, I knew in my heart of hearts that it may be futile, but I was going to do it anyway. It was nearly 5 weeks to the day in December when I asked my friend Sue to please dig a hole in the back yard, as that was where I wanted her to be buried. Fortunately the ground wasn't frozen yet. My Chinese practitioner, Charles, had given Truffle a treatment earlier in the day but he had already left for the day. I placed a com- Precious Moments with Ms Truffle Using Essential Oils \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 35 forting blanket on the floor, played some soothing music for Sue and I and then proceeded to use my oils. I placed oils of lavender, frankincense and laurel around her blanket, never leaving her side. I also placed lavender on her heart. Her sonny boy, Percival never left her side either. My hand was on the phone to call the vet and say I was coming but I quickly changed my mind. So, Ms Truffle simply fell asleep and passed away quietly. I was sobbing and I believed the other dogs did not visually know what was going on. I found out differently later. We buried her there in the back yard with all her toys, etc and with the other beloved pets from years past. I have reflected on many things in writing this wonderful article and have come to a few conclusions. One, animals know more than we give them credit for. Two, I experienced that with her passing, the boys (Percival and Mr. Hans) did not sleep well that night or for the next five weeks. I tried the usual things, lav- ender around the heart, in the bedding but with little success. Many thanks to my friend and colleague, Kathleen Baker, who made a wonderful blend of hydrosols comprised of: cornflower, orange blossoms and yarrow. I followed Kathleen's directions to a tee. I was to spray some of this blend into my hands, rubbing them together, and then rub behind both ears of the dogs and around their hearts. I was overjoyed when the first night they slept a longer amount of time. Each night following they slept increasingly longer until they were back on track and their \"mom\" was back on her schedule and the rest is history. It really is a blessing that essential oils were part of my journey with Ms. Truffle. Post note: The morning after Truffle's passing, when I let the boys out to do their business, they flew down my ramp and jumped over a small fence and found where she was buried. I was very happy that I had fol- lowed them out as I believe they would have dug her up. It is truly amazing what a strong bond our ani- mals share with one another. I continue to use essential oils for the two boys and they regard this gesture as heartwarming. How do I know that? Well, they do not move one inch while I massage them. They rest quite comfortably and sleep thru the night and much later into the morning. I have had many experiences in my life and many that have changed me. The experience with Ms. Truffle and the gift of helping her die peacefully has been an experience of a lifetime. It changed me and en- hanced my professional desire to include this in my lectures about death and dying, to raise it to a new plateau with talks at veterinarian's offices and informing their staff whenever possible.

Aromatherapy has been around for centuries. It is commonly used in skin care products, to flavor foods and disinfect hospitals. Humans have become accustomed to nice, refreshing and relaxing scents sur- rounding us in the bathroom, the kitchen and workplace. Well, aro- matherapy is not just for humans, it is equally beneficial for animals too. Animals have a powerful and heightened sense of smell and respond very quickly to aromas. Scent to an animal can dictate if they are in a safe environment or if they are in danger. Historically, we have seen animals employed to sniff out the scent of missing people and drugs. Their heightened sensitivity to smell is an example of the significance and importance scent may play on emotions, behavior and physical concerns. I personally use aromatherapy with my pets and they love it. It has helped with a variety of con- cerns such as thunderstorm freight, submissive urination, anxiety, skin irritations and grief. I place a few drops of essential oil on an Aromaball diffuser anytime we need it. When the animal has had enough, they get up and move to another room to let me know its time to unplug the dif- fuser. They typically lie next to the scent anywhere from a few minutes to twenty minutes. I also mist the air with an aromatic room spray, use an aromatherapy shampoo or conduct olfactory sensory testing (OST) to help with specific concerns. To conduct OST, I place one essential oil under the animal's nostril and watch their response. If they back away or run, this tells me that is not the scent for them. If they stay still and breathe easier and deeper, I will let them have 1 -3 more sniffs. I only use about 2 -3 oils during one ses- sion of OST. I am very careful not to get the undiluted essential oil on the pet's nose, hair or skin, as it may cause severe skin irritation. Aromatherapy may offer a variety of benefits for pets such as anti- bacterial, antiviral, anti -parasitic and stomachic. Essential oils may help pets with preventing and combating disease, provide energy, pain relief, vitality and comfort. Scent can affect animals the same as humans by provoking the hypothalamus and pituitary and di- recting the body how to react to a certain situation or stimulus. A- romatherapy has been shown to stimulate the body's own healing mechanisms thus offering a quick therapeutic response. The ol- faction process affects mood immediately as scent enters the nose in less than one second and absorbs through the skin in less than three seconds. When using aromatherapy with animals, I am most comfortable working with dogs, cats, horses and llamas. Other animals such as birds, fish, exotic animals, ferrets and others have a much more heightened sensitivity, thus the essential oil components may be toxic and hazardous. Humans and most animals have similar ol- Aromatherapy Benefits for Animals \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 37 factory systems. The biggest difference is the number of receptors each animal has. For exam- ple, dogs may have over 200 receptors whereas cats have more than double that. I personally find that dogs, horses and llamas are more than twice as sensitive to scent as humans. When creating blends for these animals, I use s 1% or less dilution ratio. Cats are more than twice as sensitive as dogs so I only use a couple drops total in a two -ounce blend. They have a much more sensitive olfactory system, delicate skin and cannot metabolize or excrete essential oils as fast therefore, I use more caution. Less is always better when working with any animal. Some symptoms to watch for with essential oil toxicity or overload may be vom- iting, dizziness, clumsiness, lack of appetite and lack of energy. In my natural health retail store, I am regularly asked about remedies for pet ailments such as behavioral issues, skin irritations, wounds, anxiety and sadness. One of the most popular com- plaints I hear is dry, itchy, red, inflamed skin irritation on the back of dogs. I find that anti - inflammatory, antispasmodic and relaxant oils work best. Here is one of my favorite recipes: Skin Irritation Spray (4 oz.) Plant -Based Enzyme Spray or Distilled Water 3 ounces Aloe Vera Gel 1 ounces Lavender ( ( Helichrysum italicum ) 2 drops Combine ingredients in a two ounce bottle, shake well and use twice daily as needed. Discon- tinue use when achieve your desired results. Our society is becoming more aware of the true therapeutic benefits aromatherapy can play on their pets overall health and are embracing this ancient old therapy. A survey conducted by the American Pet Product Manufacturers Association in 2007 found that over 63% of households in America have at least one pet. Consumers are spending more money than ever on their pets and seeking out higher quality pet foods, pet products and pet remedies. According to the Organic Trade Association (OTA), organic pet foods in 2007 reached $55 million and is expected to reach nearly $73 million in 2008. The best consumer is an educated consumer. I encourage each of you to look around at your local grocer and start reading the ingredients on some of the pet products such as shampoo, flea repellent and digestive aids. Most of them probably contain some form of essential oils. Know what you are putting in and on your pet so you can make a responsible and educated decision. 100% pure essential oils offer therapeutic benefits. Fragrance, synthetic and chemically -adulterated oils do not. Remember, quality is im- portant but education is key. Using aromatherapy and natural remedies with my pets has been a real journey. I started with my old soul canine friend, Morgan over seven years ago. At the beginning of my aromatherapy journey, he was diagnosed with lymphoma. Although the vet gave him 4 -6 weeks to live, Aromatherapy Benefits for Animals \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 38 of my aromatherapy journey, he was diagnosed with lymphoma. Although the vet gave him 4 -6 weeks to live, he had six quality -filled months before his passing. When I am confronted with challenges like this, I find comfort in seeking out the greater good or lessons to be learned from the situation. Morgan brought me more joy and happiness than words can express. He taught me more about myself and about the type of person I wanted to become. My only regret is that I wasn't able to tell him this personally while he was still alive. I know in my heart that he will al- ways be with me, offering strength, courage and conviction. Morgan was my inspiration for writ- ing my third book, Aromatherapy Guide for Pets. My goal is to share my journey with others to help them help themselves.

Phytotherapeutical use of essential oils in veterinary medicine Evidence -based veterinary phytotherapy is still in its infancy. Especially the phytotherapeutical use of essential oils in anima ls is mainly based on anecdotal reports and experiences of veterinarians, aroma therapists and pet owners. The complaints which are commonly treated with essential oils, for example, in horses, poultries, pigs, dogs, cats and rabbits, concern the digestion system, skin infections, wounds, inflammations, respiratory ailments and diarrhoea. Essential oils enter the body in three ways: (1) applied to skin; (2) inhaled or (3) ingested. For external application, it is generally recommended to use essential oils in concentr ations of 3 to 5% diluted in carrier oil, such as sweet almond oil, apricot kernel oil, jojoba oil, avocado oil, and olive oil, or embedd ed in creams, liniments, sprays, tinctures, and shampoos. (a) For example, lavender oil ( Lavandula angustifolia ) can be used on the skin for cuts and minor burns, and it can also be inhaled to promote relaxation and sleep. (b) Essential oils can also be massaged locally to alleviate pain. For that reason, some drops (approximately 30 -50ml) of essent ial oils, such as juniper oil or rosemary oil, dissolved in carrier oil can be applied to skin area with gentle rubbing. (c) A blend to control pet odor may consist of lavender oil, geranium oil and lemon oil. It is recommended to add one or two drops of the essential oil mixture to carrier oil, and subsequently massaged gently for 3 to 4 minutes into hairless or least hairy ar ea of the skin, such as armpit, groin or thigh. (d) To calm down nervous or hyperactive dogs, it is reported to place a few drops of lavender oil on the dog\u00b4s bed or sleepin g area or rub a little on the food pads. (e) Fleas hide within the pet\u00b4s fur as well as in carpets, parquets and window coverings. A blend for the treatment of flea i nfested animals is claimed by an USA patent. In this case a mixture of pennyroyal oil, eucalyptus oil, cedar oil, citronella oil and rue oil in- serted into apricot kernel oil, olive oil or almond oil up to a concentration of 7% is recommended. (f) To combat ticks, a mixture of TTO (10 drops) and lavender oil (10 drops) dissolved in carrier oil (all together 10 ml) is recom- mended. In this context, the question poses if essential oils are able to affect ticks. In an in vitro experiment the acaricidal effect of TTO against nymphs of Ixodes ricinus (tick) was examined. It could be shown that 8 to 10 ml TTO was lethal for more than 80% of the ticks when TTO was inhaled. The effect correlated very well with the duration of exposure of ticks to TTO, with a signifi cant ef- fect after 90 minutes of exposure. This finding shows that TTO seems to be useful in controlling ticks on dogs because ticks are efficient vectors of pathogens. (g) Essential oils are also widely used for parasitic mite infection control in honeybee colonies. Laboratory and field tests have shown that essential oils are very effective (50 to 95%) against Varroa lives in the tracheal tubes of honeybees. The volatile oils are used in bee hives either as fumi- gants, or mixed with sugar syrup for ingestion by bees. The last finding is that microencapsulated menthol is a new formulati on which can be added to honeybee feed for an effective mite infection control. II. Antifungal effect of TTO on Malassezia pachydermatis isolated from canines suffering from cutaneous disease While human skin is usually colonized by lipid -dependent Malassezia furfur , from the skin of wild and domestic carnivores, such as dogs, cats, bears, ferrets and foxes, Malassezia pachydermatis can be recovered. The yeast exhibited a short oval to ellipsoidal cell shape and a typical unipolar budding reproduction procedure ( power point image 9 ). Particular in dogs and cats Malassezia pachydermatis plays an important role in the pathogenesis of externa and seborrhoic dermatitis. Additionally, a high coloniza- tion rate of the yeast was found on parts of the body with poor air circulation, for instance, in interdigital areas ( power point im- mage 10 ) as as anal sac and vagina. colonization by coagulase -positive staphylococci such as Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus intermedius has been frequently demon- strated. The diagnosis of these infected skin lesions was characterized by pain, unrest, pruritus, erythema and a local loss of hair. In clinical practice miconazole or ketoconazole shampoos combined with chlorhexedine or selenium sulfide shampoos have been External application of essential oils in animals \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 45 commonly used. In order to look for an alternative agent we determined the minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of TTO against five clinical strains of Malassezia pachydermatis in comparison to terbinafine -HCL ( power point immage 11 ). TTO inhibited all test strains at uniform low concentrations of 560 to 1120 mg/ml. As expected the susceptibility of the test ed yeasts to terbinafine -HCL was prominent with MFC values of 0.4 to 1.6 mg/ml. In addition, apart from its antimycotic effect, TTO displayed also a remarkable antibacterial activity against different stap hylococci species with MIC -values 1200\u00b5g/ml to 5000\u00b5g/ml ( power point immage 12 ). This finding means that two microorganisms both involved in acute and chronic dermatitis can be inhibited at the same time by TTO in vitro . Therefore, clinical trials are needed to proof its efficacy in vivo. III. Topical use of a 10% TTO -containing cream against canine localised pruritic dermatitis The prevalence of dermatological disorders in animals has been shown to be more than 10% of all consultations in veterinary p rac- tices. Standard therapies for canine dermatitis glucocorticoids, admini stered both topically and systematically. Glucocorticoids and antibiotics are frequently misused pharmaceutical substances, responsi ble for well -known subsequent clinical adverse reactions. As a possible alternative treatment, we tested a standardised 10% tea trea oil cream against a commercial skin care cream (with hydroxybenzoat) in the management of canine localised acute and chronic der- matitis. Fifty-seven dogs with clinical manifestations of mostly pruritic skin lesions or alterations, corroberated by predominantly posi tive fungal and bacterial skin isolates, were enrolled by seven practising veterinarians. The study was perfomed as a randomised, con- trolled double -blind, multi -centre clinical trial. The dogs were randomly allocated to two study groups: 28 in the TTO group (10 % TTO cream) and 29 in the control group (commercial skin cream). Blinding was conducted by filling the two different creams in iden- tical white tubes. The pet owner was instructed how to apply the cream by another person, otherwise not involved in the study . The test creams were administered twice daily (dose: 25 mg of the 10% TTO cream per cm2 of skin was applied). Overall efficacy of treatment: After 10 days of treatment ( power point immage 13 ) the overall efficacy was scored at 71% as very good or good in the TTO group, whereas only 41% of the dogs in the control group had this score. The results of the two study groups differed significantly (p=0.04). Assessment of pruritus, erythema and alopecia: Efficacy results relating to individual improvement of the three most frequently occuring clinical signs in the study, pruritus, erythema and alopecia ( power point immage 14 ), were also analyzed on day 10 and compared to day 0. Differences between the two study groups, due to clinical sign severity changes from resolved to improve d to unchanged or to worse, were significant for pruritus (resolved: 24 dogs at day 0 to 12 dogs at day 10) and alopecia (resolved : 20 dogs at day 0 to 15 dogs at day 10), both in favour of TTO cream. In summary , ten days after beginning the study, clinically relevant and statistically significant improvements in favour of the 10% TTO cream were seen after symptomatic treatment of localised pruritic dermatitis manifestation. The control cream, a commerci al skin care cream preserved with hydroxybenzoat (antiseptic chemical), also turned out to be efficacious after 20 days, probabl y demonstrating a slower self healing process combined with antiseptic effects. The positive clinical effect of the 10% TTO cre am is assumed to depend on previously documented antibacterial, antifungal and the demonstrated antiprurigenous effects of its acti ve plant -based component TTO. IV. Species specific differences and toxicological aspects When using essential oils, veterinarians and aroma therapists must consider the differences between species and between herbi- vores and carnivors, along with other factors, like size and sex. For example : 1. Dogs can utilize carotinoids from plants to synthesize retinol, but cats require preformed Vitamin A from animal tissue. Dogs can use either fish or plant sources of omega -3-fatty acids, whereas cats require fish because they lack in delta -6- desaturase. Cats can synthesize neither eicosapentaenoic acid from a -linolenic acid nor arachidonic acid from linoleic acid. Essential oils are rapidly absorbed orally and dermally. Terpenes are metabolized by the liver to glucuronide, glycine and su l- fate conjugates. Repeated exposure can cause induction of the systems. Glucuronidation is an important detoxification mechanism present in most ani- mals except in cats. Cats are therefore highly sensitive to essential oils as their liver is lacking in glucuronyl transferas e External application of essential oils in animals \u00a9 Copyright NAHA All rights reserved 2008 46 activity. Lack in this enzyme system may result in slower elimination of terpenes and thus build up of toxic metabolites in the body of cats causing toxicity problems. On the other hand, essential oils are not associated with a higher incidence of adverse side -effects or intoxications than from ingestion of prescription or OTC pharmaceuticals. In most cases of reported adverse side effects, essential oils were used to treat dermatological conditions at inappropriate high doses. For instance, a dog was exposed to 2 g of pennyroyal oil per kg body weight due to its flea repellent activity. Histopathological examination of liver tissue showed massive hepato- cellular necrosis. The toxin in pennyroyal is thought to be pulegone which is bioactivated to a hepatotoxic metabolite called menthofuran. It is clear that in this special case pennyroyal oil was extremely overdosed. The most common clinical signs after dermal exposure of inappropriate high concentrations of essential oils include ataxia, muscle weakness, depression, and behavioral abnormalities. For instance, transient paresis was seen in small -breed dogs when TTO was applied down the spine as a topical flea treatment. Cats have developed scrotal dermatitis after exposure to D-limonene or linalool. V. Conclusion Evidence -based veterinary phytotherapy is still in its infancy. At present, the use of essential oils in animals is exclusively based on anecdotal reports and experiences of aroma therapist s and pet owners. So called aroma therapists are mostly laymen and subsequently lacking in a medicinal background. Our first clinical trial with TTO in dogs have shown that an evidence -based use of essential oil in animals is possible. When using essential oils in animals species specific differences have to be taken in account. Essential oils are powerful biological agents which should be used in appropriate doses, indicated ailments, during a limited time period and with care. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Scientific Background; Prof. Dr. J\u00fcrgen Reichling Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Dep. of Biology University of Heidelberg, INF 364, 69120 Heidelberg Born in Heidelberg, 1943.

With them comes renewed appreciation for the ability to swat or scratch. Consider the cow or horse in barn or field, constantly exposed, relying on a tail whose swish falls short of vulnerable face and eyes. Of necessity great patience must develop, One which tolerates smaller humans to Routinely ride or abuse the udder. Compare this to cat and dog, All four appendages efficiently able to vigorously address the needs of lower back, neck and head...a clear evolutionary advantage over human legs that go just so far, then must return. Yogis patiently learn to wrap their legs around their neck but can they brush away a gnat at the same time? Superior circumduction could unconsciously underlie the high esteem in which human animals hold the cat and dog, bringing them into homes where they are responsibly provided for; lovingly catered to with little reciprocity required beyond welcoming nuzzle, bark or lick. A hierarchy of servitude might be measured by the number and degree rotation of ball and socket joints with the ability to swat and scratch.
