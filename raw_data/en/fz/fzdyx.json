Cohn, DVM, PhD, DACVIM, Christopher Neha Taneja, MBA, MSHCM, LVT ABSTRACT These guidelines are an update and extension of previous AAHA peer-reviewed canine vaccination guidelines published in 2017. Vaccination is a cornerstone of canine preventive healthcare and one of the most cost-effective ways of maintainingad o g 's health, longevity, and quality of life. Canine vaccination also serves a public health function by forming a barrier against several zoonotic diseases affecting dogs and humans. Canine vaccines are broadly categorized as containingcore and noncore immunizing antigens, with administration recommendations based on assessment of individual patientrisk factors. The guidelines include a comprehensive table listing canine core and noncore vaccines and a recommendedvaccination and revaccination schedule for each vaccine. The guidelines explain the relevance of different vaccine formu-lations, including those containing modi ed-live virus, inactivated, and recombinant immunizing agents. Factors that potentially affect vaccine ef cacy are addressed, including the patient 's prevaccination immune status and vaccine dura- tion of immunity. Because animal shelters are one of the most challenging environments for prevention and control ofinfectious diseases, the guidelines also provide recommendations for vaccination of dogs presented at or housed in ani-mal shelters, including the appropriate response to an infectious disease outbreak in the shelter setting. The guidelinesexplain how practitioners can interpret a patient 's serological status, including maternally derived antibody titers, as indi- cators of immune status and suitability for vaccination. Other topics covered include factors associated with postvaccina-tion adverse events, vaccine storage and handling to preserve product ef cacy, interpreting product labeling to ensure proper vaccine use, and using client education and healthcare team training to raise awareness of the importance of vac-cinations.

Department of Agriculture). \u00a9 2022 by American Animal Hospital Association JAAHA.ORG 1VETERINARY PRACTICE GUIDELINESIntroduction Vaccination is an essential component of preventive pet healthcare and an important pathway to nurturing a long-term veterinarian- client-patient relationship. Universal, routine vaccination for high-morbidity or high-mortality diseases such as canine distemper, canine parvovirus enteritis, and rabies is necessary for individual health and to maintain herd immunity to these infections, therebyreducing the risk for disease spread and outbreaks. Recognizing thatthere is hesitancy and skepticism in the human population to vacci- nation, client education can play a key role in helping pet owners understand that vaccination is a safe, effective, and necessary part oftheir pet 's healthcare plan and that it acts as a barrier to zoonotic dis- eases that can affect client households. All members of the veterinary healthcare team should be able to communicate a consistent, uni ed message to clients about the importance of immunization against preventable infectious diseases. Protocols for baseline and individual- ized vaccination plans are useful tools not only for implementingvaccination practices but also for client education. These guidelines include updated vaccination recommendations and dosing schedules for canine vaccines licensed in the United States. These recommendations are presented in easy-to-referencetables, categorized by core and noncore vaccine antigens. Core vac- cines are de ned as those recommended for all dogs irrespective of lifestyle, e.g., rabies. Noncore vaccines are those recommended forsome dogs based on their risk of exposure when factors such as life-style, geographic location, and endemic conditions are considered, e.g., Lyme disease ( Borrelia burgdorferi infection). Because animal shelters represent one of the most challenging environments for theprevention of canine infectious disease, these guidelines include a detailed discussion of current recommendations for vaccination of shelter dogs \u2014at presentation, as resident animals, or in case of a dis- ease outbreak. A simpli ed approach to determining the role of patient serologic titers as indicators of the need for primary or repeat vaccination is also described. Licensed canine vaccines have a high degree of proven safety and ef cacy. For this reason, dogs that present with an incomplete or ambiguous vaccination or health history can still be vaccinated with the expectation of a protective immune response and a low risk of serious postvaccination adverse effects. Stated another way, veterinar- ians can assume that the bene ts of vaccination far outweigh the risks in cases of dogs with unknown immune status or vaccination history \u2014a common occurrence in veterinary practice. Examples of these real-world scenarios include the possibility of recent natural exposure, absence of serologic data to guide a vaccination decision,or suitability for noncore vaccines such as Leptospira spp. Thanks to the reliability of the licensed vaccine armamentarium, a good rule of thumb is, \"When in doubt, vaccinate. \"Vaccine Overview and Types Vaccines are one of the medical and public health successes of the 19th and 20th centuries. Their use has reduced morbidity and mor-tality more than any other intervention in human and veterinary medicine. Vaccination of companion animals protects the health of the individual animal, improves animal welfare in community set-tings (e.g., shelters), protects public health (e.g., rabies and leptospi- rosis), and reduces the occurrence of infectious diseases that transmit mainly within a species (e.g., canine variants of rabies virus, canine distemper, and canine parvovirus). Vaccines have mitigated the impact of infectious diseases on populations through herd immunityso successfully that some dog owners may hold the perception that vaccination is no longer necessary. Although individual dogs with low-risk lifestyles (i.e., minimal exposure to other animals) may ben-et from herd immunity, unvaccinated individuals are still more vul- nerable to infection, and reductions in population-level vaccination rates without eradication of the pathogen will inevitably result in arecurrence of disease at outbreak levels. This has been clearly demon- strated by recurrent canine distemper and parvovirus outbreaks in shelters, and by recent outbreaks of measles in human populationswhere reduced vaccine coverage exists. Vaccine ef cacy, assessed during product development, is mea- sured as the proportionate reduction of disease in vaccinated groups compared with unvaccinated groups. Although necessary for the pur-poses of licensing, vaccine ef cacy calculated under these controlled settings may not equate to the population impact of the vaccine in real-world settings. This impact, known as vaccine effectiveness, is more dif cult to quantify, especially in veterinary medicine, which lacks the robust surveillance systems for monitoring the numbers ofindividuals vaccinated and disease cases. Vaccination failures, namely, the occurrence of disease in an animal that has received an appropriately administered vaccine against that disease, are rare butshould be expected because no vaccine achieves 100% effectiveness. Vaccination failures can occur for many reasons including: /C15Failure of the vaccinated patient to mount an adequate immune response. /C15Exposure to the infection before being fully vaccinated. /C15Interference of maternal antibodies. /C15Improper storage or handling of the vaccine, including inappropri- ate administration. /C15Waning immunity (e.g., immunosenescence, or age-related deterio- ration of the immune system). /C15Vaccine manufacturing errors, such as lack of potency due to insta- bility, expiration, or improper storage. Vaccination failures should be promptly reported to the manu- facturer. These reports are essential for detecting changes in product performance due to defects in particular lots of vaccine. In theUnited States, if a veterinarian is unable to report to the 2 JAAHA | 58:5 Sep/Oct 2022manufacturer, reports can be made directly to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Center for Veterinary Biologics.More information and instructions on reporting are available onlinefrom the USDA at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/ animalhealth/veterinary-biologics/adverse-event-reporting/ct_vb_adverse_event . Although no vaccine produces complete immunity or protec- tion, the term duration of immunity (DOI) is commonly used forthe length of time a vaccine is expected to produce a robust immuneresponse and protection against illness following exposure. DOI data,unlike vaccine ef cacy (the reduction in disease in vaccinated ani- mals compared with unvaccinated animals) data, are not required for licensure by the USDA. Exceptions to this include rabies vaccines and, recently, new vaccines for which no pre-existing products areavailable. Vaccine labels historically recommend booster doses everyyear. Increasingly, data are available from postlicensing studies dem-onstrating that the effect of many vaccines persists for extended peri-ods. In some cases, DOI data have been submitted to the USDA to update vaccine labels. These data have also been considered in vac- cine guidelines developed by various stakeholder groups. Becausedata also reveal differences in serologic titers following administra-tion of different vaccine formulations for the same pathogen, extrap-olation about ef cacy and DOI between products may not always be appropriate. 1-11 Table 1 lists the characteristics of the four general categories of canine vaccines based on the physical attributes of the vaccine immunizing antigen. Recommendations for Core and Noncore Canine Vaccines Based on existing data and Task Force expertise, the AAHA Canine Vaccination Task Force has separated vaccines into two categories,core and noncore. Core vaccines are those de ned by the Task Force as vaccines recommended for all dogs irrespective of lifestyle, unless there is a speci c medical reason not to vaccinate. Examples of core vaccines include canine distemper virus, canine adenovirus type 2,canine parvovirus type 2, and rabies. Noncore vaccines are those rec-ommended for some dogs based on lifestyle, geographic location,and risk of exposure. Canine leptospirosis vaccine, canine Bordetella vaccine, canine Lyme vaccine, canine in fluenza vaccine, and the Western diamondback rattlesnake toxoid are considered noncore. Table 2 lists core and noncore vaccines as determined by the Task Force and their dosing recommendations. The designation of acore vaccine was unanimously supported by all members of the TaskForce, but there was not always consensus regarding noncore vac- cines. For example, some members of the Task Force asserted that the canine leptospirosis vaccine should be considered a core vaccinebased on the increasing geographical prevalence of the disease. How- ever, others preferred to leave this decision up to the veterinarian.For regions where noncore pathogens are endemic, such as canine leptospirosis and canine Lyme disease, these traditionally noncore vaccines may be considered a core vaccine by veterinary practices in those locations. As travel with pets becomes more popular and vector-borne diseases spread, patients should be carefully assessed at least annually to determine their vaccine requirements. These should be considered general rather than universally prescriptive recom-mendations. Veterinarians have the discretion to administer vaccines off-label when scienti c data, local circumstances, or evolving stand- ards of care support that decision. In those situations, informed con- sent from the client is still an important consideration. 12 These guidelines have been revised from prior versions to pro- vide consolidated and updated clinical information, allowing the vet- erinarian to select the best vaccines and protocols to t individual patient needs. The guidelines are to be considered discretionary rec-ommendations, and the Task Force emphasizes that practitioners should be aware of the importance of reviewing and following manu- facturer 's label instructions for speci c vaccines, including instruc- tions on proper mixing and use of diluents. Different types of vaccines for the same pathogen may induce different immunologicresponses depending on vaccine technology, formulation, route of administration, and patient factors. Key Vaccination Considerations by Antigen Canine Distemper Virus, Canine Adenovirus, and Canine Parvovirus Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) Canine distemper virus can infect many species including domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, foxes, ferrets, skunks, and raccoons. Although relatively unstable in the environment, the wide host range and worldwide disease distribution allow for increased risk of virus expo- sure for free-roaming dogs. CDV vaccines are considered core vaccines, recommended for all dogs regardless of geographical location. CDV vaccines contain vector with tar- geted CDV genes. The minimum age to begin the primary vaccina- tion protocol in puppies is 6 -8 wk. MLV vaccines can be blocked, however, by maternally derived antibodies (MDA) against CDV,which decline exponentially over time and are usually absent by 12-14 wk of age. Revaccination is therefore recommended at 2 to 4 wk intervals until greater than 16 wk old; 18 -20 wk of age may be preferred particularly in areas of high CDV risk. After the primary puppy series of vaccinations, a booster should be administered within 1 yr. Thereafter, interval boosters every 3 yr2022 AAHA Canine Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 3are recommended; annual boosters are not necessary. Longer (.3 yr) duration of immunity after vaccination has been suggested11 b u ti sl a r g e l yu n s u b s t a n t i a t e di nt h ep e e r - r e v i e w e dl i t e r a t u r e . Detection of CDV antibodies after vaccination can be performed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI), virus neutralization (VN), orenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). (See the guidelines s e c t i o no nU t i l i z a t i o na n dI n t e r p r e t a t i o no fS e r o l o g i cT i t e r s ) . Canine Parvovirus (CPV) Canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2) is the most common cause of viral enteritis in dogs. Three antigenic canine variants, CPV-2a, CPV-2b,and CPV-2c, have been identi ed, but they are 99% genetically similar. 12 Domestic and wild canids are susceptible to CPV-2, but risk of infection is most likely from virus particles shed by other domesticdogs. The virus is relatively stable in the environment. CPV is trans-mitted by oronasal exposure, but CPV MLV vaccines are currentlyregistered for parenteral administration and are generally highlyeffective once maternal antibody concentrations fall below inhibitory levels. CPV MLV vaccines are considered core vaccines, recom- mended for all dogs regardless of geographical location, and areTABLE 1 Categories of Canine Vaccines Based on Physical Type of Immunizing Antigen /C3A list of licensed veterinary biologics is available at /C3 IN, intranasal; SQ, subcutaneous. /C3For dogs in shelter environments, see narrative for additional recommendations.2022 AAHA Canine Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 5currently considered protective against the three known variants.13 The minimum age to begin the primary vaccination protocol in pup- pies is 6 -8 wk. However, MLV vaccines can be blocked by MDA against CPV, which decline exponentially over time and may persist for 13 -15 wk or possibly longer.2,14Revaccination is therefore recommended at 2 to 4 wk intervals until greater than 16 wk old; 18-20 wk old is preferred particularly in areas of high CPV risk. In spite of the core vaccination recommendation for CPV, CPV diagnoses in young dogs ( ,1 yr old) continue owing to a lack of protective antibodies, particularly in dogs presenting to animal shel- ters.15Although host-related factors may play a role, failure to com- plete primary vaccine schedules or vaccine storage or administrationerrors may account for many or most \"vaccine failures. \" 16,17 After the primary puppy series of vaccinations, a booster should be administered within 1 yr. Thereafter, interval boosters every 3 yr are recommended; annual boosters are not necessary. Longer (.3 yr) duration of immunity after vaccination has been suggested11 b u ti sl a r g e l yu n s u b s t a n t i a t e di nt h ep e e r - r e v i e w e dl i t e r a t u r e . Detection of CPV antibodies after vaccination can be performed by HI, VN, or ELISA diagnostic tests. (See section on Utilization and Interpretation of Serologic Titers.) Canine Adenovirus (CAV) Canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) is considered a core vaccine, pri- marily because it is necessary for the prevention of canine adenovirus type 1 (CAV-1) (against which it cross-protects),18the cause of infec- tious canine hepatitis, historically recognized as a severe and often fatal disease of canids. Although uncommon, sporadic cases of CAV- 1 infection are still reported.19Vaccination schedules for parenteral CAV-2 vaccines follow the recommendations for CDV and CPV, and CAV-2 is usually a component of combination vaccines. CAV-2 can also cause tracheobronchitis and is part of the canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) complex. Given in combination with canine parain fluenza virus (CPIV) and Bordetella vaccines, MLV CAV-2 vaccine can be administered intranasally (IN) to puppies asyoung as 3 wk of age, as mucosal immunity is not blocked by MDA. Rabies In the United States, stray dog control programs initiated in the1940s, combined with routine rabies vaccination of owned dogs, eliminated the canine rabies virus variant (strain) from circulation by 2008. The elimination of this variant of an almost uniformly fatal virus from a domestic animal species that lives as a companion in close contact with humans has saved both canine and human lives. Today, in the United States and Canada, dogs (and humans) remain at risk from host-adapted rabies virus variants in wildlife reservoirspecies such as skunks, raccoons, foxes, and bats. The extent of spill- over from wildlife is driven by the wildlife reservoir in the endemicarea, with spillover most common in areas with the raccoon variant,somewhat less with skunk variants, and least common in areas whereonly bat variants occur. The US CDC publish an annual rabies sur-veillance summary that includes useful maps illustrating the distribu- tion of terrestrial rabies virus variants as well as spillover events into dogs. Links to recent publications on rabies and rabies epidemiologyare available at https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/ index.html . The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) also compiles rabies statistics at https://inspection.canada.ca/animal- health/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/rabies/rabies-in-canada/eng/1356156989919/1356157139999 . Because of the high fatality rate and public health risk posed by rabies infection, administration of rabies vaccine to dogs is legallymandated in many jurisdictions. Age at initial vaccination, timing ofbooster doses, vaccine formulation, response to overdue boosterdoses, and whether rabies vaccine exemptions are permitted may allbe stipulated in laws or regulations. Mandates can exist at the local,state, and provincial levels, and veterinarians should be aware of allapplicable requirements in their area. Veterinarians that serve clientsin multiple jurisdictions with variable requirements should generallyapply the requirements of the jurisdiction where the animal resides.Local and state health departments ( https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/ resources/contacts.html ) and state public health veterinarians (listed at http://nasphv.org/Documents/StatePublicHealthVeterinariansBy State.pdf ) are important sources of information about vaccine requirements, local rabies epidemiology, animal rabies testing, andrisk assessments following a possible rabies exposure. Rabies vaccines are highly immunogenic and effective. Vaccine failures are rarely reported. In jurisdictions where it is not man-dated, rabies is recommended as a core vaccine, used in accordancewith the most current recommendations in the Compendium ofAnimal Rabies Prevention and Control ( http://www.nasphv.org/ documentsCompendia.html ). Currently, all licensed rabies vaccines for dogs are inactivated (killed) with 1 and 3 yr DOI formulationsavailable. All licensed products are labeled for puppies 3 mo of ageand older. A booster dose is recommended 1 yr following the initialvaccination regardless of the formulation or age at initial vaccina-tion. The booster 's purpose is to immunize any animals that failed to respond to the initial dose. At this time, there are no publisheddata supporting the ef cacy of half-doses of rabies vaccine. Legal exemptions from rabies vaccination requirements are only available in certain jurisdictions. Because exposure to rabiesposes a risk to both animal and human health in unvaccinated orundervaccinated dogs, possible exemptions should be discussed withthe owner in the context of the animal 's health and lifestyle (i.e., risk 6 JAAHA | 58:5 Sep/Oct 2022of exposure). Veterinarians should document these discussions in the medical record. Antibody titer levels as correlates of protection have not been established for rabies, and serologic testing is not con- sidered a substitute for vaccination.20-25 Leptospirosis Vaccination for the prevention of leptospirosis should be strongly considered for most dogs in North America as the disease can be life-threatening, is endemic in much of the continent, and is zoo- notic. In addition to protection from disease, vaccination may be necessary to meet state or international requirements for importation and transport of dogs. Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by spirochetes in the genus Leptospira , including L interrogans andLk i r s c h n e r i .S u r - face antigens delineate multiple different serovars, with the predomi- nant disease-associated serovars varying with geographic location and over time. In the past, L interrogans serovars Canicola and Icter- ohemorrhagiae were predominant in North American dogs, and vac- cines for these serovars have been available since the 1960s.26In more recent years, L interrogans and have emerged as important canine pathogens.27Quadrivalent vaccines for use in North America now include the addition of serovars Pomona andGrippotyphosa bacterins. The Task Force recommends the use of the 4-serovar vaccines for protection against the most relevant pathogens because vaccines induce only partial or no immunity to heterologous serogroups. 28,29 Most nonadjuvanted bacterin vaccines have been marketed more recently.28,30As is typical for bacterin vaccines, annual boosters are required, with DOI shown for various vaccine serovars ranging from 12 to 18 mo.30-35 Most dogs in North America should be considered at risk of leptospirosis. Historically, the disease was most common in large- breed dogs with rural outdoor exposure. This is no longer true. Small-breed dogs are frequently infected, perhaps because of urban and suburban exposure of dogs to wildlife reservoirs including rodents.36,37Dogs of any age, breed, or sex can be infected.38Lepto- spirosis occurs throughout North America, and while often associ- ated with exposure to water, infection is well documented in arid r e g i o n ss u c ha sA r i z o n a .38Risk factors for leptospirosis include dogs spending any time outdoors (including urban, suburban, and rural environments), exposure to rodents, and time in kennels or dog daycares.37-39 Vaccination against leptospirosis can induce antibodies that may lead to false-positive serologic tests meant for disease diagnosis.Both microscopic agglutination tests and point-of-care serologic assays are impacted by this effect.40-45Fortunately, this becomes less important in light of the fact that clinical disease is unlikely in vacci- nated dogs. Vaccination does not result in positive real-time poly- merase chain reaction test results.43 Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic pathogen.46Although there is little evidence of direct human infection from dogs, greater canine exposure to contaminated environments and close contact with people may link environmental sources to humans.47-49Newer vaccines have been documented to dramati- cally reduce or prevent renal carriage and urinary shedding of leptospires from exposed dogs, potentially protecting humanseven if indirectly. 27,32,35,50,51 Historically, veterinarians have been concerned about adverse reactions to leptospiral vaccines.52-54V a c c i n ef o r m u l a t i o n sh a v en o w been altered to minimize the likelihood of such reactions. Based on available information, adverse reactions to leptospiral vaccines seem to be rare, with ,53 adverse events per 10,000 doses.53,54Most adverse reactions are minor, and serious anaphylactic reactions were reported no more often for dogs given leptospiral vaccines than for other vaccine antigens. Nevertheless, adverse reactions of any type are more likely in smaller and younger dogs.53For this reason, the Task Force suggests that the initial dose be administered at or after 12 wk of age. Other measures to mitigate adverse reactions include minimizing the number of different vaccines administered at a single visit and following manufacturers recommendations, such as allow-ing a vaccine to reach room temperature before injection. 54 Borrelia (Lyme Disease) Vaccination for Lyme borreliosis should be considered for dogs that live within or travel to regions with emerging or endemic Lyme dis- ease. Lyme disease is caused by infection with tick-transmitted borre- lial pathogens. Although at least 21 species of borrelial pathogens can cause Lyme disease, in North America disease is due almost exclu- sively to Borrelia burgdorferi .55,56In 2014, species in the B burgdorferi sensu lato complex were awarded a new genus designation, Borre- liella. However, this nomenclature is not yet routinely used by veteri- narians and Bb u r g d o r f e r i refers to either.56 Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of Ixodid ticks.55In the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central United States and east- ern Canadian provinces, the primary vector is Ixodes scapularis (black-legged tick, or deer tick), whereas on the Paci cc o a s t ,t h ep r i - mary vector is Ixodes paci cus(western black-legged tick). Although the geographic expansion of endemic areas may well occur, currently infections are largely restricted to clusters of states where these ticks, and appropriate mammalian disease hosts, are abundant.2022 AAHA Canine Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 7Dogs that spend time outdoors in endemic regions are most likely to bene t from vaccination. Vaccination should be comple- mented with an ectoparasite control program as prevention of tickfeeding prevents disease transmission. 57,58For dogs with travel planned to an endemic area, both initial vaccinations should be com-pleted 2 to 4 wk before travel. In a recent large dataset (2013 -2019), states with $5% seroprevalence in tested dogs included (in order of highest to lowest prevalence) Connecticut (15.5% seroprevalence),Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire,Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, West Virginia, Minnesota, Vir-ginia, Maryland, Delaware, Wisconsin, and District of Columbia. 59 In Canada, the disease is endemic in portions of Manitoba, easternOntario, southern Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. 60,61 Dogs can serve as sentinels for infection in humans for this zoonoticdisease, and regions with the greatest canine seroprevalence mirrorregions with more human infections. 59,62Fortunately, although Lyme disease is zoonotic, there is no direct transmission frominfected dogs to people, and infection in either species depends onvector transmission. 63 Most dogs infected with Bb u r g d o r f e r i remain healthy.63Only #10% develop a polyarthritis that is responsive to antimicrobial therapy.63The most important potential consequence of infection is protein-losing nephropathy. For the estimated 1 to 5% of infecteddogs that develop Lyme nephritis, the outcome is often fatal despiteantimicrobial therapy. 63-65Predisposition to Lyme nephritis has been suggested for retriever breeds, perhaps warranting additionalconsideration for vaccination in these breeds. 63,64,66 There are four types of Borrelia vaccines approved for use, each of which has been proved safe and ef cacious. Vaccines for preven- tion of Lyme disease exert their protective effect in an unusual way.All available vaccines can induce canine antibodies that bind borre-lial outer surface proteins that are expressed while the pathogen is inthe tick (OspA). Having only OspA in a vaccine has been shown tobe effective. 67It is also known that lipidation is a determinant of immunogenicity, and the lipidated recombinant OspA-only vaccineelicits a robust immune response. 68Some vaccines can also induce antibodies to an antigen that is expressed shortly after transmissionto the dog (OspC). 56,69,70When the tick ingests antibodies to OspA from the vaccinated dog while feeding, the bacteria are killed beforetransmission. Antibodies to OspC extend protection against any bac-teria that were not successfully killed inside the tick, thus acting syn-ergistically with antibodies to OspA. 69,70 Antibodies induced through vaccination may or may not result in positive serologic tests depending on test methodology.63,71 -73It is important to understand the impact of vaccination on tests used foreither screening or disease diagnosis. Differentiation of vaccinationfrom infection is possible for Bb u r g d o r f e r i .Bordetella , Canine Parainfluenza, and Canine Influenza Previously evaluated74challenge of immunity studies in Bordetella bronchiseptica (Bb)-seronegative beagle puppies have provided vari- ably ef ed-live combination IN and single-component oral vaccines forBb. More recently, current combination IN and single-component oral vaccines for Bbhave been directly compared.75,76Data from these studies75,76are con flicting concerning the equivalency of the oral versus IN route in conferring immunity; one showed no differ-ence between routes, 75whereas the other demonstrated superior clini- cal ef cacy of the IN route.76Altogether, available data indicate that commercial vaccines for Bball\"work \"at some level, regardless of the route of administration.74-76However, in general, the IN (versus oral) route of administration is preferable for respiratory pathogens. This isbecause it has been recognized that the common mucosal immune system, as originally conceptualized, was an oversimpli cation and that there is compartmentalization of mucosal immune responses, atleast to some extent, making IN delivery of antigen more effectivethan oral at stimulating responses in the respiratory tract. 77-83 There may be an immunological bene t in combining different vaccines and routes of administration in a primary series. This strat- egy is called \"heterologous prime-boost \"and involves administering different forms of an antigen by different routes to broaden andextend a response. 83Although little studied in small animal veteri- nary medicine, there is an extensive comparative literature,78includ- ing a dog-relevant Bordetella pertussis murine model,84supporting this approach. Currently, heterologous prime-boost is being widelyinvestigated in an effort to improve responses to vaccines for COVID-19. 85One study using a combination of IN and injectable (whole-cell bacterin) Bbvaccines demonstrated a signi cant clinical benet to this approach versus either vaccine alone.86However, this strategy has not yet been evaluated with current canine vaccines for Bbor other pathogens. Concerning boosting of Bbvaccines, current combination IN and single-component acellular injectable Bbvaccines have been shown to induce equivalent anamnestic (memory) Bb-speci cI g G a n dI g Ar e s p o n s e sw h e nu s e da sb o o s t e rv a c c i n e si np r e v i o u s l y immunized adult household dogs.87There are no similar published studies concerning the use of the single-component oral vaccine forthis purpose or any use in household dogs. Dogs that are at risk for Bbare also at risk for canine parain- fluenza virus (CPIV) and canine adenovirus virus-2 (CAV-2) and should be vaccinated for all three pathogens. 88,89Only the current combination IN and injectable (core) vaccines contain these patho-gens. Therefore, the use of single-component oral and injectable Bb vaccines is not recommended. Exceptions include dogs that cannot 8 JAAHA | 58:5 Sep/Oct 2022be vaccinated IN, or in the case where the injectable Bbvaccine is used simultaneously with the injectable core vaccines as a booster forIN primed responses in a puppy series. 85,86If an IN (modi ed-live) Bbvaccine is inadvertently administered by injection, the vaccine package insert or manufacturer should be consulted, as resulting inflammatory reactions can be serious.90 Duration of immunity and related recommendations for annual vaccination for Bband CPIV are largely based on experimental infec- tions in seronegative laboratory beagle puppies.74,91,92Such studies, usually conducted at peak immune response after vaccination, cangenerally accurately assess the ability of a vaccine to reduce disease.However, the validity of using such studies employing group-housed,genetically similar subjects to determine DOI conferred by vaccines tohousehold dogs is questionable. It is dif cult to model heterogeneous household conditions comprising the plethora of the host, environ-mental and pathogen cofactors that can contribute to the brevity orlongevity of protective clinical immunity. The latter endeavor requireswell-designed and well-conducted eld trials, including disease report- ing; however, these types of studies are rare. One seminal study of thenatural history of Bbindicated that the duration of clinical immunity (reduction of disease) may be as short as /C246m o . 93The duration of clinical immunity to CPIV in household dogs is unknown.91There- fore, for patients at high risk for CPIV and Bb, it may be advantageous to use IN combination Bband CPIV vaccines more frequently than annually, for example, before boarding. In addition to boosting adap-tive immune responses, the latter practice may better ameliorate dis-ease through stimulation of the local innate immune response (type 1 interferon), 94although this is poorly documented in small animals. Canine in fluenza virus (CIV) serotypes H3N8 and H3N2 have been documented in North America and other parts of the world.95 Disease caused by these viruses is usually indistinguishable from that caused by other respiratory pathogens associated with canine infec-tious respiratory disease (CIRD), although severe and sometimesfatal disease can occur in CIV-infected dogs. In contrast to CPIV,which tends to be endemic, or at least prevalent, in canine popula-tions, 88,89CIV infections and clinical disease to date have occurred as multicentric nonsustaining outbreaks.95Therefore, the routine use of CIV vaccines in all dogs is currently not recommended. Etiologicdiagnoses of CIRD cases using quantitative polymerase chain reac-tion respiratory pathogen panels, together with monitoring CIV ( https://www.vet.cornell.edu/animal- health-diagnostic-center/news/canine-in fluenza-civ-updates ), should be used to determine whether CIV vaccination is warranted in indi-vidual dogs, especially in dogs that are boarded and otherwise com-mingled at dog daycare, dog parks, dog shows and agility events, andin dogs who travel. Although immunity to in fluenza viruses is pri- marily serotype-speci c, the use of bivalent CIV vaccines may avoidskewing of responses to one serotype. 96This could broaden protec- tive immunity and is therefore recommended. Rattlesnake Toxoid Currently, there are no published data documenting the cacy of the western diamondback rattlesnake ( Crotalus atrox )v e n o mt o x o i d in dogs.97-99In a published experimental challenge study,100mice were vaccinated with 50- to 1500-fold (by volume) higher doses oftoxoid than recommended in dogs and were subsequently challenged intraperitoneally with high doses (twice the LD 50)o fv e n o m .T h i s protocol and challenge are of questionable relevance to rattlesnake- bitten dogs. In addition, although vaccinated mice had an increased survival time, a cohort of vaccinees died or required euthanasia earlier than unvaccinated controls following exposure to venom. Similarly, adverse reactions, including anaphylaxis, in previously vac- cinated, then envenomated, dogs have been reported.99 The venom of pit vipers including the Crotalidae is antigenically heterogeneous.101Despite the manufacturer 'sc l a i m so fc r o s s - protection against envenomation by pit vipers other than Ca t r o x , there are no published data to support this in dogs. Veterinarians choosing to use this toxoid should be aware of the lack of peer- reviewed published data. Polyvalent antivenin therapy is an alterna- tive to vaccination in suspect cases of rattlesnake bite.98 Vaccination of Shelter Dogs and Puppies Increased opportunities for disease exposure and transmission,heightened animal stress, and high population turnover rates con- tribute to an elevated risk for infectious disease in dogs housed in high-density environments such as animal shelters. In addition, dogs entering shelters are less likely to be immune against CPV and CDV than owned dogs. 102-104Of equal importance, infectious diseases are detrimental for individual animals, entire shelter populations, and community animals if an outbreak occurs. These increased environ- mental and patient risk factors inherent to shelter populations war- rant more stringent vaccination requirements than those for owned dogs. Accordingly, all dogs, unless severely ill and unable to be housed within the shelter, should be vaccinated upon shelter entry. MLV vaccines should be used (as opposed to inactivated vaccines)owing to the possibility of more rapid onset of immunity. The DA2PP vaccination schedule in puppies should be started at a youn- ger age, have shorter intervals between vaccinations, and end at an older age than that in owned puppies. Core vaccines for dogs in shelter environments include paren- teral or high-risk foster homes, foster-based rescues, breeding facilities, sanctuaries, boarding2022 AAHA Canine Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 9kennels, and pet stores, should consider following the same vaccina- tion protocol. Unless suf cient and reliable documentation of current vaccina- tion status is presented, all dogs and puppies 4 wk of age and oldershould receive an MLV DA2PP vaccine at or before shelter entryand receive boosters at 2 to 3 wk intervals until they reach 18 -20 wk of age. In addition, exposure to infectious disease should be physi-cally avoided for puppies, ideally through placement in foster careuntil adoption or upon reaching 18 -20 wk of age. All dogs older than 18 -2 0w ko fa g ea tt i m eo fe n t r ys h o u l d receive an initial dose of MLV DA2PP vaccine followed by a boostervaccine 2 -3 wk later, administered either within the shelter, if the dog remains in care, or by their owner 's veterinarian after adoption. When dogs are housed in shelters for prolonged periods of time, theyshould receive booster vaccinations as recommended for owned dogs. All puppies and dogs older than 3 wk of age should receive an INBband CPIV vaccine with or without CAV-2 at or before entry to mitigate CIRD. Although not documented in dogs, IN administra-tion probably stimulates a local, rapid innate (interferon) response inaddition to mucosal IgA. In puppies, this immune response avoidsinterference from maternal antibodies. 89,105,106Single-component mucosal vaccines that contain only Bbshould be avoided because dogs that are deemed at risk for Bbshould be vaccinated against CPIV as well. Injectable Bbvaccines should be avoided in shelter environments owing to a delayed onset of immunity, including littlestimulation of the local immune responses in the upper respiratorytract. This leads to reduced ef cacy in limiting CIRD compared with IN vaccines. Oral or injectable single-component Bbvaccines are only recommended when it is not possible to administer a two-wayIN vaccine. A single dose of a rabies vaccine should be administered paren- terally to all dogs older than 12 wk of age before release from theshelter. Rabies vaccination is not required upon shelter entry, as riskof exposure to rabies within the shelter environment is limited. How-ever, if a long-term stay is anticipated, rabies vaccine should beadministered on entry with the other core vaccines. Local legal man- dates regarding the level of veterinary supervision required for rabies vaccination should be considered when developing shelter protocols.Rabies vaccination is acceptable even if additional vaccines may havebeen administered to the patient within the past 2 wk. Conclusiveevidence is lacking that concurrent vaccination against multiplepathogens will impair the expected immune response to any individ-ual component. Ensuring shelter dogs are vaccinated against rabiesupon release from the shelter provides a signi cant public health benet and outweighs any theoretical risk of vaccine interference. Routine vaccination of shelter-housed dogs against Leptospira , B burgdorferi (Lyme disease), and canine in fluenza virus (CIV;H3N8 or H3N2 serotypes) is not recommended because these infec- tions usually pose a minimal risk within the shelter environment. However, local endemic or epizootic infections, such as in CIV out- breaks with potential for shelter exposure, as well as available shelter resources, legal requirements, and the risks and bene ts of vaccines should be considered if adopting these noncore vaccinations in a shelter protocol. 107Shelters should advise owners to discuss an indi- vidually tailored vaccination program with their veterinarian after adoption. Pregnancy and mild illness or injury are not contraindications to administering core vaccines (CDV, CPV, CAV-2) to shelter- housed dogs. The overall bene ts of MLV vaccination in a high-risk environment outweigh the potential risks posed by vaccination.108If ad o gi sm i l d l yi l lw h e nv a c c i n a t e do ne n t r yt ot h es h e l t e ra n dt h e immune response to vaccination is of concern, then boostering the MLV DA2PP vaccine in 2 -3 wk (or after the animal has recovered) will likely provide additional protection. Shelters that vaccinate all animals on entry provide optimum herd immunity within their pop- ulation. Conversely, shelters that do not vaccinate on entry or do not vaccinate all dogs are at higher risk for an infectious disease outbreak.109,110 Infectious Disease Outbreak Management in Shelters An infectious disease outbreak is one of the more daunting chal- lenges in the high-risk animal shelter setting. Temporary cessation of animal intakes is a helpful initial approach to an outbreak. Appropri- ate vaccination of resident or incoming dogs is a crucial strategy when an infectious disease outbreak occurs in the animal shelter population. A proper vaccination strategy in the face of an outbreak is dependent on the pathogen involved, its route of transmission (oral vs. respiratory), the stage of the outbreak, effectiveness of local sanitation practices, and the vaccine formulations being used. Unfor- tunately, there are virtually no published data from controlled studies in dogs that address these issues, relegating decisions to clinical judgments. Serological testing offers shelters an effective tool to help man- age disease outbreaks, particularly in the case of CDV and CPV, as opposed to depopulation or prolonged lockdown of the shelter. Although additional host, pathogen, and environmental cofactorsthat contribute to disease outbreaks must also be taken into account during the outbreak management process, serological testing can provide supplemental insights. Serological testing, by providing indi- vidual risk assessment, can assist in population flow decision making during an outbreak. In general, healthy, seropositive dogs, especially those with high titers, are likely resistant to disease and can be con- sidered low risk. They can be adopted with appropriate waivers. 10 JAAHA | 58:5 Sep/Oct 2022Healthy, seronegative dogs, who are potentially susceptible to disease a n dc o n s i d e r e dh i g hr i s k ,s h o u l db eq u a r a n t i n e da n ds e p a r a t e df r o mthe rest of the population (ideally, placed in foster care outside of theshelter). They should be revaccinated, observed for development ofclinical signs throughout the anticipated incubation period of the dis-ease, and serologically retested 10 -14 days later. Puppies, especially those#4 mo of age, require additional management during an out- break. Serological testing and risk assessment of dogs in this agegroup can be misinterpreted because of the potential presence oftransient maternal antibodies. Cessation of intake into the shelter is critical for effective out- break management. If temporary cessation of intake is not possible, then housing newly admitted dogs in a completely segregated area of the shelter (with infection control practices, including designatedstaff and equipment) is required to prevent disease transmission. Utilization and Interpretation of Serologic Titers In human medicine, the ef cacy of modern vaccines is established and monitored primarily on the basis of standardized serology (\"titers \") in conjunction with large-scale clinical trials and usually substantial centralized disease-reporting processes from vaccinatedpopulations. 111A similar approach has been applied to some extent in livestock medicine. This has been facilitated by large vaccinatedpopulations and driven by economic imperatives; immunity favor-ably affects production parameters. Data deriving from such studies are nearly absent in canine populations. Studies of experimental infections to determine vaccine ef cacy in dogs generally involve small numbers of animals and may usechallenge organisms and methods that do not reproduce naturallyoccurring diseases. In addition, vaccine ef cacy and licensing studies generally use purebred beagles with limited genetic heterogeneity.There are relatively few studies conducted in household dogs. Under- standing these limitations, as well as the biological reality that vac- cines almost never protect 100% of the population 100% of the time,is essential to convey reasonable expectations of vaccine ef cacy to clients. \"Protective titers \"f o rC D V ,C P V ,a n dt oal e s s e re x t e n tC A V - 1 have been of most interest to general practitioners. These viruses often cause lethal infections in na\u00efve dogs and comprise the core antigens for which there are very effective vaccines. Generally, labo-ratories determining titers have used VN tests for CDV and HI testsfor CPV. 112-114Both are bioassays and report results as titers, which are dilutions of antibody. Both VN and HI tests measure antibodiesto viral surface proteins that directly relate to neutralization of the virus (VN) or are a surrogate for actual neutralization (HI). In con- trast, depending on how the test antigen is prepared, ELISA tests canmeasure antibody responses that are not involved in protection, such as responses to internal nuclear proteins. Results are generallyreported as \"units, \"not titers. Interpretation of titers can be dif cult for several reasons. First, by their nature, they are subject to intralaboratory and interlabora-tory variation. This issue was at least implied in seminal stud-ies. 112,113Second, there is no readily available documentation of standardization or comparative results of these or other tests when performed in different laboratories. This makes it dif cult to inter- pret a titer, especially if it is not very low or very high. Lastly, at best,the determination of \"protective titers \"h a sb e e nb a s e do nl i m i t e d data. These data were thoroughly reviewed 20 years ago. 112Nothing more substantive has become available since then. ELISA-based in-clinic antibody detection tests have been available for CPV and CDVfor more than 20 years. 115,116HI and VN tests, respectively, were used as \"gold standards \"to determine their sensitivity and speci city, as it relates to a \"protective titer. \"115-117Commercial ELISAs have been applied in shelter populations outside of the laboratory and fur-ther compared with HI and VN tests. 117,118Such applications have provided no further basis for a determination of \"protective titers, \" primarily because the titers or amounts of antibody were not corre-lated with clinical outcomes. Recognizing these limitations, no valuesfor\"protective titers \"are indicated in these guidelines, although some commercial laboratories will provide them. After the disappearance of maternal antibodies, the presence of any detectable antibody (a titer) indicates, by de nition, that an immune response to vaccination or exposure to an antigen involvingat least B and helper (CD4 1) T cells has occurred. 94The presence, or absence, of antibody is not necessarily indicative of coincidentcell-mediated immune responses, or their absence. 94Altogether, a titer, almost regardless of the amount, is not necessarily indicative ofprotection or susceptibility. Rather, it is more complicated thanthat. 119Disease in the individual animal results from the interaction of host, pathogen, and environmental cofactors. It can be misleadingto forecast an outcome on the basis of one cofactor: a titer. Routine administration of commonly used vaccines has been associated with uncommon to rare adverse events in dogs. 52,120Cur- rently, for the core antigens, most practicing veterinarians haveadopted a 3 yr protocol. Unlike in human medicine, it is based onvery limited population-based data involving disease reportage, andexperimental challenge studies directly comparing the responses inannually versus triennially (or any other interval) vaccinated dogsare lacking. Altogether, routine \"titer testing \"to ascertain the neces- sity to revaccinate at currently recommended intervals is not usuallyadvised, except in cases in which dogs have a history of adverseresponses to vaccination, there is a suspicion of vaccine-related auto-immune disease, or when owners express resistance or hesitancy to2022 AAHA Canine Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 11having their dogs vaccinated or boostered \u2014in which case client com- munication and education may help overcome this hesitancy. Postvaccination Adverse Events and Reactions Undesired or unexpected consequences after vaccination include fail- ure to provide protection from disease and adverse reactions associ- ated with vaccine administration. Failure to provide protective immunity is primarily of concern in very young or very old dogs.Young dogs most commonly fail to mount a suf cient immune response following vaccination because of the presence of MDAfrom colostrum. Puppies in some breeds, e.g., Doberman pinschersand rottweilers, have been purported to be immune nonresponders to a standard initial vaccination series, but de nitive evidence of this characteristic is lacking. Questions are sometimes raised about whether multiple vac- cines, simultaneously administered, diminish or overwhelm theimmune response. Although antibody responses can vary afteradministration of different vaccines and antigens, there is no evi-dence of a lack of protective immunity following concurrent admin- istration of multiple antigens or vaccines. Vaccine ef cacy in older dogs is typically related to concerns of immunosenescence, an age-related decline in the function of theimmune system. Although geriatric dogs may have a relative diminu-tion of na\u00efve T cells to confront new antigens, these patients gener-ally do not lack memory cells created from previous exposure to antigens in early or mid-life. 121 Adverse postvaccination reactions may be (1) caused by inap- propriate administration of a modi ed-live product, (2) secondary to innate immune responses to the vaccine, (3) speci c cell-mediated or humoral immune responses to vaccine components, or (4) inducedby vaccine antigens that return to virulence (unlikely in appropriatelytested and licensed vaccines). Localized cell-mediated immune reactions or generalized sys- temic responses can occur after vaccination. Type I hypersensitivity reactions have been linked to vaccination, but vaccine associationswith other immune-mediated diseases, e.g., immune-mediated throm-bocytopenia, immune-mediated polyarthritis, are less consistent. 122-126This may indicate that factors besides vaccine antigens are responsible for immune disease sequelae following vaccination. Adverse reactions, as well as desirable immune responses, are genetically in fluenced in some cases. Immunogenetics is a developing investigative eld for adverse drug and vaccine reactions in peo- ple127,128but is basically unexplored in veterinary medicine. Although some breeds have been identi ed as at increased risk of vaccine reactions,52breed (a phenotype) is a crude indicator ofgenetics. More likely, genetic predisposition for individuals exists within some family lines, thus selectively increasing risk overall forsome breeds. Owners should be informed that adverse event riskoccurs at the individual patient level. 129 In genetically predisposed individuals, undesirable immune responses can be triggered by various vaccine antigens.123,130In dogs, IgE reactivity has been detected against components of cell culturemedia used to propagate vaccinal viruses and other pathogens. Mostly,the offending substances are xenogeneic (to dogs) proteins, such as infetal calf serum, e.g., bovine serum albumin, gelatin and casein. 131In other words, the antigens of concern are typically componentsthat are notthe label (pathogen) antigens. Thus, identi cation and quantity of these antigens are not part of manufacturer labels. Although genetic predisposition cannot be altered, adverse event risk can be diminished by reducing the quantity of vaccineantigens presented to the patient 's immune system. Because antigens of concern are not the label antigens, combination vaccines contain-ing multiple pathogens do not inherently carry more adverse eventrisk than single-component vaccines. Because of the way rabies vac- cine virus is propagated, single-component rabies vaccines may have more adverse event risk, as they have a more diverse array of pro-teins than combination vaccines containing other viruses that arepropagated similarly, or other single-component vaccines. 132 Reducing antigenic stimuli can be achieved by reducing the number of vaccines administered at a single of ce visit. This is a par- ticularly useful approach in small dogs.52Reducing the administered volume ( \"split dosing \") for any vaccine below the manufacturer 's recommended volume is notadvised, because the USDA and manu- facturer have not approved such reductions. Therefore, this practicec o u l di n v o l v et h ea s s u m p t i o no fl i a b i l i t y . 12 Reducing the number of vaccines administered at a single of ce visit may necessitate additional of ce visits in order to provide neces- sary vaccine coverage and complete protection. Although compari-son studies have not been performed, at least 2 wk is recommendedbetween vaccines to allow the heightened immune response from themost previous vaccination to subside. If possible within guidelines and manufacturer recommenda- tions, administering vaccines nonparenterally, e.g., mucosally or IN,can also reduce adverse event risk. A common question is whether at-risk patients should be pretreated with diphenhydramine before vaccination. If the risk is hypothetical, i.e., involving an at-risk breed but in cases in which no previous reactions have occurred, pretreatment as a precaution isgenerally not recommended. Although prevaccination administrationof diphenhydramine may prevent type I hypersensitivity reactions,the lack of any subsequent reaction does not actually prove the pre-treatment was bene cial or necessary. 12 JAAHA | 58:5 Sep/Oct 2022If the vaccination risk involves a dog with a history of previous vaccine reaction, one cannot presume reactions will automaticallyrecur. Precautions such as limiting the number of vaccines adminis- tered are prudent, as is prevaccination of diphenhy- dramine. Single anti-in flammatory doses of glucocorticoids, if administered, do not impair humoral responses to vaccination. 133,134 If the vaccination risk involves a patient with an existing immune- mediated disease, consideration should be given to the stability and condition of the patient, the need for vaccination, and prudent waysto minimize adverse event risk. If vaccines are administered to patients with existing medical conditions or health concerns, clients should sign an informed con- sent statement as increased risk of disease may result if the dog 's immunocompetence is compromised. When a dog experiences a possible adverse event, the veterinary team should report the speci c patient and vaccine information to the vaccine manufacturerand/or the USDA. ( https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/ animalhealth/veterinary-biologics/adverse-event-reporting/ct_ vb_adverse_event ). Vaccine Storage and Handling Vaccines are among some of the most important resources used to protect animals 'health. However, they are only effective if they are stored and handled correctly. Improper handling and storage can decrease the ef cacy of the vaccine, leaving the animal vulnerable to disease.135Speci c details about storage and handling protocols can be found in each manufacturer package insert. In general, storage and handling require vaccines to be kept in a temperature-controlled environment from the time they leave themanufacturer to the time of their administration, a process known asthe vaccine cold chain. 135,136The vaccine cold chain is a shared responsibility between the manufacturer, distributor, and veterinary team. The development of a standard operating procedure to ensureproper ordering, storage, and administration is essential to the vac- cine protocol of a veterinary healthcare provider. Storage and temperature monitoring equipment are critical to ensure proper vaccine potency. The CDC recommends purpose-builtunits (also known as pharmaceutical grade) or stand-alone house- hold refrigeration units to properly store vaccines. 135,136Either purpose-built or stand-alone units can be compact size or larger. Ahigh-quality thermometer should be kept in the center of the refrig-erator. Temperatures should be monitored and recorded per the vet- erinary team 's standard operating manual. Refrigerated vaccines should be stored at temperatures between 2 /C14Ca n d8/C14C( 3 6/C14Fa n d4 6/C14F).135,136The thermostat should be set at midrange to achieve a temperature of /C245/C14C( 4 0/C14F), which will decrease the likelihood of temperature fluctuations.135,136Vaccinesshould be organized and placed centrally in the refrigeration unit to promote proper air flow, typically 2 -3 inches from the walls and doors.135,136R e m o v ed e l i ,f r u i t ,a n dv e g e t a b l ed r a w e r s ,a st h e s ea r e a s have unstable temperatures and are unsuitable for storage. Vaccines should be kept in their original packaging with lids closed until ready to open.135,136The refrigerated vaccine storage unit should be desig- nated for only vaccines. Single-dose vaccines (both freeze-dried and liquid forms) should not be removed from the refrigerator until the time of admin- istration.135,136A new, sterile syringe and needle should always be used for proper vaccine administration. A delay in vaccine reconsti- tution and administration could decrease the ef cacy of the vaccine owing to the fragility of the vaccine and temperature fluctua- tions.135,136Multidose vaccines typically have preservatives to allow prolonged storage once the seal has been opened.135,136See the vac- cine package insert for manufacturer recommendations and direc-tions for proper storage and handling. Interpreting Vaccine Labels Labels for veterinary vaccines have recently undergone considerable changes to bring greater clarity to the user. Historically, veterinary vaccines were assigned a tier system based on the effectiveness of the protection of the vaccine.137The tier system was initially not well understood and led to confusion among veterinary practitioners. As a result, the USDA implemented a new rule that requires vaccine labels to contain a simple claim and provide the public the opportu- nity to view the relevant safety and ef cacy studies online.137,138The new label system states: \"This product has been shown to be effective for the vaccination of healthy ( name of species, weeks of age or older against name of disease).137Veterinarians are encouraged to review individual manufacturer ef cacy and safety data online at the Licensed Biological Product Information website: https://www.aphis. usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/animalhealth/veterinary-biologics/CT_ Vb_licensed_products . Vaccine Licensure veterinary biologics include vaccines, bacterins, antisera, diagnostic test kits, and other products of biological origin acting through immunologic mechanisms to prevent disease.139The USDA, under the authority of the Virus-Serum-Toxin Act, governsand mandates the licensure of biologics. 139The USDA prohibits the preparation or sale of veterinary biologics that are ineffective, contaminated, dangerous, or harmful.140The mandate of the Virus- Serum-Toxin Act is interpreted with the understanding that veterinary biologics should be safe, pure, potent, and ef cacious.140Regulatory over- sight through the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is described in 9 CFR 101-124. In the United States, manufacturers2022 AAHA Canine Vaccination Guidelines JAAHA.ORG 13are inspected before the issue of their rst license for a product and then periodically inspected afterward. Not only are the physicalplants inspected, but starting materials (seed virus, bacteria, and celllines) are also tested for purity and identi cation. 137Once a license has been granted, no substantial changes in the manufacturing pro-cess are allowed to ensure a consistent product. 137 Vaccines are granted different licenses through different catego- ries.137Fully licensed products meet the requirements that establish the purity, safety, potency, and ef cacy of the product. Conditional licenses are issued in order to meet an emergency condition, limited market,local situation, or other special circumstance under expedited proce-dures that ensure purity, safety, and a reasonable expectation of ef - cacy. Imported products can be permitted for distribution and sale and must meet the same standards as fully licensed products. This scenario is typically associated with factors such as a lack of USDA-licensedproducts and a viable threat of emerging infectious animal disease. 137 The licensure standards for veterinary vaccines in Canada are similar to those required in the United States for fully licensed prod-ucts. Regulated products include vaccines, immunoglobulin prod-ucts, and diagnostic kits that are used for the prevention, treatment, or diagnosis of diseases in animals, including domestic livestock, poultry, pets, wildlife, and sh. To meet the requirements for licen- sure, veterinary biologics must be shown to be pure, potent, safe, andeffective when used in the target species according to the manufac-turer 's label recommendations. Product labeling must be compliant with Canadian requirements, including the use of metric units and complete information available in both English and French. The CFIA, under the legislative authority of the Health of Animals Actand Regulations, is responsible for regulating veterinary biologics inCanada. 141Responsibilities of the CFIA in licensing vaccines include verication of products (master seeds), licensing of the manufactur- ing facilities, and issuance of import and/or export permits.141In addition, the licensing submission must also contain supporting data demonstrating that the product can be manufactured and used with-out adversely affecting animal health, human health, food safety, orthe environment. 141 Client Education and Training the Healthcare Team Creating a well-de ned vaccination protocol with consistent messag- ing serves as a framework for the veterinary team to reference during patient visits. This reinforces the importance of vaccines for the vet-erinary team and ensures that a consistent message is communicatedbetween the healthcare team and clients. A protocol also helps thehealthcare team follow a consistent vaccination schedule, especiallywhen starting an initial series of vaccines, while concurrently consid- ering the lifestyle, geographical location, and risk factors for eachindividual pet. At a minimum, a vaccination schedule should consist of the following information: /C15Anatomical location of vaccine administration /C15Route of administration /C15Age requirements and/or restrictions /C15Frequency of administration A vaccination protocol should be created with the patient 's needs and lifestyle in mind, with buy-in from the client through edu- cation explaining the importance of vaccines. The Need for Consistency Creating consistency across the healthcare team builds a strong prac-tice culture, decreases confusion about recommendations, assists with training team members, and increases compliance. This better enables all team members to educate clients about vaccination schedules, disease prevention, and what to expect following vaccination. Clienteducation materials can support practices by educating clients about vaccinations, vaccine reactions, and disease processes. Wellness plans prove to be advantageous by creating consis- tency within a practice and providing a standard for quality pet care. Wellness plans often include the recommended vaccinations for pets and help the healthcare team deliver a clear message when it comes to the health of the dog. They can also reduce redundancy in deliver- ing key points about certain vaccines, vaccination protocols, and theimportance of vaccination. Developing Client Education Materials Client education continues even after a dog presents to a practice for vaccination. Developing client education materials and creating a practice library can provide a ready resource to clients about why,what, and when vaccines should be given to their pet. The more cli- ents understand the reasons for vaccination, the more likely they will see the importance of adhering to an individualized vaccination schedule for their dog. Each practice should consider creating a source (online or physical copies) of educational material for clients, discharge instructions for practice teams, and short blurbs of 1 -2 sentences about each vaccine and the disease(s) it prevents. More comprehensive educational material can be stored in a repository and used as requested or needed. Determining the Best Communication Approach In order to determine how to best communicate with clients, it is important to assess client communication preferences. A survey or questionnaire can be used to ask clients about their preferred contact methods or whether they would like to receive speci c additional 14 JAAHA | 58:5 Sep/Oct 2022material. Client preferences can then be noted in the patient 'sh i s t o r y . This allows information to be relayed in a way the client understands. With electronic medical record systems now in veterinary practices, documenting and nding client information has simpli ed. Some electronic medical record systems can even connect with mobile appli- cations where clients and hospital teams can communicate. Summary Regular vaccination of canine patients is a central component of pre- ventive healthcare, as well as an opportunity for the practice to engagewith clients to discuss the importance of disease prevention. These vaccination guidelines provide a current and comprehensive resource for making informed decisions when designing vaccination protocols for dogs. Vaccination best practices are based on individualized needs determined by the patient 's history and risk of disease exposure. Whereas core vaccines are recommended for every dog regardless of lifestyle, noncore vaccine recommendations are determined by assess- ing the likelihood of a dog 's exposure to a given infectious disease. Licensed canine vaccines have a high degree of safety and ef cacy, and in most cases, the bene ts of vaccination far outweigh the risks. Dogs presented at, residing in, or originating from animal shelters are in a high-risk setting for infectious disease exposure and outbreaks, and shelter-speci c vaccination protocols seek to mitigate that risk. It is important that the entire healthcare team be well versed on the practice 's vaccination philosophy and protocols. The practice team is then prepared to deliver a consistent and uni ed message to clients on the importance and role of vaccination in patients 'healthcare plans. Improper vaccine storage and handling and failure to adhere to label recommendations are the principal reasons for the occasional incidence of vaccination failure. Periodic staff training can minimize these procedural shortfalls and help ensure that vaccination is a reli- able and useful tool for delivering optimum pet healthcare.
