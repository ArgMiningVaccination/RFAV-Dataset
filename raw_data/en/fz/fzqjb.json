It is optional for transfer students, but we hope you'll join us. wayne.edu/orientation/two Watch your WSU email for further details this summer!ACADEMICS Wayne State University | 7 Know what we mean A glossary of common academic advising terms Academic advisor: Professional staff or faculty members who help students determine their requirements for graduation, select appropriate courses and connect to campus resources. Blackboard: This online resource connects you to your professors and classmates. You'll find your syllabus, textbook requirements and homework assignments here. Log on to blackboard.wayne.edu with your AccessID and password, then scroll to the bottom of the page to take a free, self-paced online tutorial. See page 16 for more information. Bulletin: Intended to provide academic information and course descriptions, it specifies the requirements that must be met and the courses that must be taken to complete each degree. This document is found online at bulletins.wayne.edu. Changing your major: This is accomplished by declaring a new major through an academic advisor. Corequisite (coreq): A course that is paired with another course and must be taken the same semester (such as a lecture/lab combination). Declaring your major: This is accomplished through an academic advisor so official records can indicate the degree you are working toward. General education requirements: Classes in addition to major professional courses needed to ensure fundamental skills and a well-rounded education. Some majors require choosing from a preselected list to fulfill these requirements. Learning Community: A team of students led by an upperclassman peer mentor and faculty member who work together toward course or program goals, supporting each other in study groups and other activities outside the classroom. There is no additional charge beyond standard tuition. See page 16 and lc.wayne.edu for details. Plan of work: A year-by-year list of the courses a student needs to successfully complete their degree. Because some classes must be taken in the right order, this outline keeps students on track and takes uncertainty out of registration. Meet with an academic advisor to create a plan of work specific to your program, and see page 57 for a general example. Pipeline: An Internet gateway that provides single sign-on and secure access to WSU computer systems (such as Wayne Connect email and calendars, Blackboard and OneCard) as well as university, library and computing resources, and financial aid. Prerequisite (prereq): A course or qualifying exam that is required before enrolling in a desired class. Who is my advisor? College of Liberal Arts and Sciences: Students who enter the university with a declared CLAS major will meet with an academic advisor for their specific major. You can find your advisor online at clasweb.clas.wayne.edu/advisor. Pre-Medicine and Health Science Center: Provides prerequisite advising, academic support and professional development strategies for students interested in pre-med, pre-dental, pre-nursing, pre-pharmacy and health sciences professional programs. You will meet with an academic advisor at 1600 David Adamany Undergraduate Library. See facebook.com/WSUPreHealth or call 313-577-2680 for more information. CLAS Exploratory Tracks: Undergraduate students who are not ready to choose a major upon admission select an Exploratory Track that best fits their interests. Academic advisors work with these students in an intentional and programmatic way to help them explore the majors that WSU has to offer while making progress in general education and college requirements (limited to 45 credit hours, upon which time a major must be declared). You will meet with your academic advisor at 1600 David Adamany Undergraduate Library. See advising.wayne.edu or call 313-577-2680 for more information. Each department in the College of Fine, Performing and Communication Arts has its own academic advisors. Students should go to www.cfpca.wayne.edu to find the right academic advisor for their major. Students pursuing a degree in the College of Engineering should contact the advisor for their specific program. Visit engineering.wayne.edu and click on Current Students for a list of academic advisors and faculty members. College of Education academic advisors have walk-in appointments every Tuesday (excluding holidays) at 9 a.m.-4 p.m., or you can call the Student Services office to make an appointment. Education Building, Room 489 coe.wayne.edu 313-577-1601 Students who are majoring in accounting, finance, global supply chain management, information systems management, management or marketing will receive advising from the School of Business Administration. Walk-in advising is held every Tuesday (excluding holidays) from 9 a.m.-6 p.m. Call the Student Services office in the School of Business Administration to schedule an appointment. Prentis Building, Room 200 business.wayne.edu 313-577-45108 | Green & Gold GuideMarks An I (Incomplete) is given to an undergraduate student when they have not completed all of the coursework as planned for the term and when there is, in the judgment of the instructor, a reasonable probability that the student will complete the course successfully without again attending regular class sessions. The student should be passing at the time the grade of I is given. A written contract specifying the work to be completed should be signed by the student and instructor. Responsibility for completing all coursework rests with the student. The I will be changed to a letter grade when the student completes the coursework as arranged with the instructor or, if the instructor has left the university, with the chairperson of the department or other instructional unit. Work must be completed within one calendar year. There are no extensions. An I will not be awarded if, in the instructor's judgment, it is necessary for the student to attend subsequent sessions of the class. If regular attendance is necessary to complete coursework, the student must register for the class for the semester in which attendance is planned. The student will be assessed tuition and applicable fees for the second registration. If the student decided to register for the course subsequent to the assignment of an I, then the mark of I for the original election will be changed to a WP (Withdrawal/Passing) and the student will be responsible for tuition and applicable fees for the second registration. Students are responsible for notifying their department offering the course that they have reregistered for the course so that the I is not changed to an F (Failure). Any unchanged I will within, one calendar year from the time it was received, be changed to an F. This will not be changed. WF (Official Withdrawal Failing) is given when the student withdraws from the course in accordance with the university policy and the student had earned a failing grade as of the date the withdrawal is approved. WN (Withdrawal Non-Attendance) is given to students who did not attend any classes and/or did not complete any assignments and/or did not participate in credit-earning activities by the withdrawal date. WP (Official Withdrawal Passing) is given when the student drops the course in accordance with the university policy and the student had earned a passing grade as of the date the withdrawal is approved. Y (Deferred) is given when the student is up-to-date with the work of a course planned to continue beyond the semester (i.e., essay, thesis, dissertation and certain courses taken in sequence). Z (Audit) is given when the student has formally registered for the course for audit. The student's academic dean or designee must provide written audit authorization to the student at the time of registration.

Grade points are calculated per credit. P, N, S, U, M, ANC, BNC, CNC, PNC, NNC, SNC and MNC grades are not reflected in the grade-point average. Undergraduate courses completed with a P may count toward a degree. S, M or U performance in non-degree courses and certain designated courses such as fieldwork, practicums and internships do not affect grade-point averages.Wayne State University | 9 Student Code of Conduct The primary purpose of the Student Code of Conduct is to promote campus civility and academic integrity and to provide the framework for the imposition of discipline in the university setting. The code gives general notice of prohibited conduct and of the sanctions to be imposed if such conduct occurs. The code specifies the rights of the student and the rights of other parties to the procedure. The code is designed to ensure that students who are alleged to have engaged in unacceptable behavior receive fair and impartial consideration. It is important that each of us become familiar with the Student Code of Conduct and share the responsibility for maintaining a reputable university committed to academic excellence. For more information and to read the Student Code of Conduct, visit the Dean of Students Office website at doso.wayne.edu. Academic misconduct Academic misconduct is any activity that tends to compromise the academic integrity of the institution or undermine the education process. Examples of academic misconduct include: Plagiarism: To take and use another's words or ideas as your own without appropriate referencing or citation. Cheating: Intentionally using or attempting to use or intentionally providing unauthorized materials, information or assistance in any academic exercise. This includes copying from another student's test paper, allowing another student to copy from your test, using unauthorized material during an exam and submitting a term paper for a current class that has been submitted in a past class without appropriate permission. Fabrication: Intentional or unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation, such as knowingly attributing citations to the wrong source or listing a fake reference in the paper or bibliography. Other: Selling, buying or stealing all or part of a test or term paper, unauthorized use of resources, enlisting in the assistance of a substitute when taking exams, destroying another's work, threatening or exploiting students or instructors, or any other violation of course rules as contained in the course syllabus or other written information. Sanctions if a student is found guilty of academic misconduct: Disciplinary reprimand: A formal notification to the student that their conduct has been unacceptable and a warning that another offense may result in a more serious sanction. Disciplinary probation: A disciplinary status that does not interfere with the student's rights to enroll and attend classes but that includes specified requirements or restrictions. Suspension: A denial of privilege to continue as a student anywhere in the university and denial of all student rights and privileges for a specified period of time. Expulsion: A permanent denial of the privilege of continuing or enrolling as a student anywhere within the university and permanent denial of all student rights and privileges. Transcript disciplinary record: An entry onto the student's transcript permanently or for a specified period of time, indicating the violation and sanction imposed. Other sanctions: Other sanctions may be imposed instead of or in addition to those specified above. Grade-point average The grade-point average is the numerical index of your scholastic average. Points are assigned to each letter grade for each hour of credit. For example, a grade of A in a class carrying three credits would be assigned 12 honor points (3x4) and a grade of a C in a class carrying 4 credits would be assigned eight honor points (4x2). To compute your grade-point average, multiply the honor points assigned to each grade by the number of credits for each course; then add the results and divide by the total number of credits. In the example below, the grade-point average would be 20 (honor points) divided by 7 (credits attempted) = 2.85, nominally a B- average. Course Grade Honor Credits T otal points HIS 1040 A 4 x 3 = 12 BIO 1010 C 2 x 4 = 8 You can also use the GPA calculator at reg.wayne.edu/students/gpa.php.

If you're undecided, we have a program to help students test the waters. These exploratory tracks are limited to 45 credit hours or less and, after completion, you must declare a major. Your advisor will be there to help every step of the way. Communication Arts 3 Fine Arts3 Humanities3 Pre-Professional Curricula If your ultimate career goal requires more than an undergraduate degree, Wayne State can help you get there. These pre-professional programs are not majors, but are designed to put you in prime position for advanced schooling. The Irvin D. Reid Honors College is for motivated students who thrive on academic challenges. Honors students can pursue any major and choose one of four Start programs, which set your course directly for graduate school at Wayne State. B Start (Business)Engineering GradStartHealthPro Start MedStart Graduate School gradschool.wayne.edu Wayne State is well known for its graduate school. Here, you can earn certificates as well as master's, doctoral and professional degrees in hundreds of fields, including law, medicine, library and information science, nursing, social work, pharmacy, physical therapy, business and more. Whether you walk onto campus knowing exactly where you want to go or you're searching for your passion, Wayne State stands ready with hundreds of undergraduate program options. 1 Students cannot apply directly to this program. Additional application process required. 2 Pre-professional curricula available. 3 Not a bachelor's degree program. Selecting classes for registration It is important to meet with your academic advisor to carefully go over your options before the priority registration period each semester. Among the things to consider when choosing your courses: How early you need to leave home. If you are commuting, figure out how long it will take to drive to campus, find a parking spot and walk to your classroom. Keep in mind that depending on where you are coming from and at what time, you could be facing rush hour traffic. And don't forget that bad weather can slow you down. Are you an early bird or night owl? Think about when you learn best and look for classes that meet around those times. Give yourself room to breathe. Be sure to leave time to get from one class to the next as well as time to have lunch or review your notes between classes. If every day is hectic, you could burn out quickly. Do you meet the requirements? Check to make sure you don't need a prerequisite before taking the class \u2014 you may not be able to register for it, or you may get to class and find yourself already behind on the first day. Have a backup plan. When deciding which classes to take, have a few backups mapped out in case something fills before you can claim your seat. Consider other time commitments. Think about family and work obligations to avoid conflicts that would mean missed classes or coursework. How many credits should you take? Generally, most students take 12-16 credits. The minimum to be a full-time student is 12, but we recommend 15 to keep pace with your degree program. When deciding what's right for you, keep in mind that for every one hour in class, you should plan to spend at least two hours outside of class doing homework and studying. 12 credits = 12 hours in class + 24 hours studying 36 hours/week as a full-time student 16 credits = 16 hours in class + 32 hours studying 48 hours/week as a full-time student Remember, you need a minimum of 120 credits to graduate, but there are only 168 hours in each week \u2014 and some of those should be spent sleeping! Wayne State University | 11 Know what we mean A glossary of common registration terms Class Schedule: Use the website classschedule.wayne.edu for registration \u2014 as well as to research classes, compose wish lists and get help as needed. Closed class: During registration, when a class is available, it will have an open status. When a class is full or otherwise not available for registration, it will have a closed status. To inquire about entering a closed class, contact the department offering that class. CRN (Course Reference Number): A unique number assigned to each class at the university. You may use this when registering for your classes. Degree audit: A self-service tool within Pipeline that allows you to evaluate your progress toward completion of your degree program. Find instructions and more by selecting STARS for Degree Audit under the Student tab on Pipeline. Degree completion requirements: A minimum of 120 credit hours is required for all degree programs. See your academic advisor to determine your school or college and program requirements. Dropping or withdrawing: Students must drop classes in Pipeline, and must do so before the end of the fourth week for a 15-week class. A dropped class will not appear on your transcript. Beginning the fifth week of class, students are no longer allowed to drop but must withdraw from classes by contacting a university official. There may be financial aid and academic consequences at this point. For details, visit reg.wayne.edu. S.M.A.R.T. Check: In order to prevent students from making rash decisions that could negatively affect their financial aid and graduation plans, Wayne State requires that anyone wishing to withdraw must first meet with an enrollment counselor. During a S.M.A.R.T. Check, a counselor will talk with the student about why they want to drop, and outline the financial and academic consequences \u2014 as well as alternatives such as tutoring. This mandatory pre-withdrawal process takes place on a walk-in basis in the Welcome Center lobby during regular business hours. Supplemental Instruction (SI): A free series of group study lessons led by undergraduates who have successfully completed that course. Find details at success.wayne.edu. Wish list: A feature in Class Schedule that allows you to find classes and save their names for quick reference during registration.

Remember why you are in college. Identify long-term goals and remind yourself of them when frustrated or overwhelmed. 2. Go to class and participate. Don't abuse your new freedom. Being in class is your responsibility, and you'll be graded on what happens there. 3. Connect with people who can help you succeed. Engage with advisors, instructors, organization sponsors, learning specialists and fellow students. 4. Make a plan. Create a schedule for your entire semester. Include due dates for your class assignments, extracurricular activities and personal time. Review it daily. 5. Improve your study habits. Students who had an easy time in high school often experience difficulty in college. Visit the Academic Success Center for personalized study support. 6. Stay healthy. Eat well, get enough sleep, and exercise your body and mind. Your well-being can positively affect your GPA. 7. Develop critical thinking skills. Challenge yourself to understand the \"why\" of course material. Why is it important? Why is it believable? This also will help you make wise decisions in other areas of life. 8. Keep a positive attitude. Things will not always work out the way you expect, so focus on what is truly important. Acknowledge what you have accomplished. 9. Get involved. Immerse yourself in the Wayne State community through student organizations, athletics, Learning Communities and other campus activities. 10. Seek out support. Asking for help is a sign of maturity. Connect with support resources regularly to stay on the right track.General ed classes: Do the write thing While Wayne State students develop a great depth of knowledge in their chosen field of study, the general education program ensures they are exposed to a broad range of topics providing a variety of ideas and approaches. It is through general education classes that students improve their skills and are introduced to methods of inquiry, modes of thought, bodies of knowledge, and representative ideas drawn from many academic disciplines. What's more, general education helps students connect what they learn in the classroom to real-world experiences. Why take writing courses early in your college career? Learning to write at the college level is an essential part of succeeding at WSU. Research shows that students who pass freshman composition are far more likely to continue into their sophomore year. Related research shows that students who do continue from freshman to sophomore year are very likely to complete their college education and graduate. General education writing courses are important because they prepare you to succeed in later courses. You'll write in many of your courses at WSU, and writing varies across professions and communities. Writing in biology is quite different from writing in psychology, and both are different from writing in philosophy, business or law. To prepare students for writing competency in different courses, careers and situations, WSU has three general education writing requirements: Basic Composition (BC), Intermediate Composition (IC) and Writing Intensive (WI) in the majors. Most students fulfill these requirements by taking a sequence of three or four of the following courses: n Basic Writing - ENG 1010, a developmental course that prepares students to succeed in freshman writing and other courses n Introductory College W riting - ENG 1020, WSU's freshman composition course n Intermediate Writing - ENG 3010, which prepares students to take required Writing Intensive, or WI, courses in their major n A major-specific WI course These courses work in sequence, each building on the last. ENG 1010 explains fundamental reading and writing concepts in depth and examines how these concepts are used in other writers' work. ENG 1020 guides students in using the concepts in their own writing for audiences in and outside the university. In ENG 3010, students learn how the concepts operate in writing within specific disciplines and professions to prepare them for WI courses and beyond. You can make important progress toward succeeding at WSU by taking and passing ENG 1010 or 1020 during your freshman year and ENG 3010 in your sophomore or junior year. Talk to your academic advisor with questions about your specific plan.

Warren Detroit, MI 48202-0340 313-577-2100 fax: 313-577-6648 studentservice@wayne.edu Know what we mean A glossary of common financial aid terms Satisfactory academic progress: In order to retain your financial aid eligibility, you must consistently make satisfactory academic progress. The financial aid office will check your progress each semester according to three standards: GP A - As an undergraduate, you must maintain a minimum 2.0 GPA. Pace - Y ou must complete at least 67 percent of your registered courses with passing grades. T ime frame - You must not exceed your program credit hours by more than 150 percent. If you fail to meet any of these criteria, you will be given one warning semester before you are denied financial aid. If you are denied aid due to unsatisfactory progress, you may appeal if you can show a reasonable plan to succeed. What's the best way to retain your financial aid? Take classes every semester, work hard and seek academic assistance if you need it. Financial responsibility: An agreement electronically signed by all students prior to registering for classes each semester. Student accepts full responsibility for paying tuition and fees, and any costs associated with collecting them. Current account balance: The balance presently showing on your student account. This amount updates in real-time whenever new fees or payments are posted to the account. This balance is available in two places on the student tab: 1. The first line under \"my eBill\"2. On the Bill/Account Summary pageTitle IV authorization: Some fees and/or charges that can be assessed on your student account are not automatically paid with federal financial aid. These fees and charges include an orientation fee, book vouchers and late registration fees. Students can authorize payment of these fees in the current semester or up to $200 of a prior year balance by signing a Title IV authorization form. If a Title IV authorization is not on file, you will be responsible for paying these fees out of pocket. You can submit the form online at finaid.wayne.edu/ receiving/title-iv.php or complete the form in the back of this book and submit it to the Student Accounts Receivable Office on the fourth floor of the Welcome Center. 18 | Green & Gold GuideFAFSA: This abbreviation is commonly pronounced as a word, but those letters stand for something important: Free Application for Federal Student Aid. The U.S. Department of Education aims to provide all those eligible with federally funded financial assistance for education beyond high school. You must complete the FAFSA every year (available beginning January 1) using the WSU school code 002329. For details and to apply, visit fafsa.gov. Grants: Generally awarded based on financial need and require no repayment. Student Service fee: Assessed to all students, it's used primarily to maintain, upgrade and replace student computing and technology resources on campus. A small portion is also used to fund student activities on campus and to enhance programs directed toward improving on-campus activities, including athletics. Scholarships: Awarded based on many factors, including academic achievement, special talent, ability or financial need. No repayment is required. Visit scholarships.wayne.edu for a complete list. Subsidized loans: Direct subsidized loans are for students with financial need. WSU reviews the results of your FAFSA and determines the amount you can borrow. You are not charged interest while you're in school at least half-time and during grace periods and deferment periods. Unsubsidized loans: You are not required to demonstrate financial need to receive a direct unsubsidized loan. Like subsidized loans, WSU determines the amount you can borrow. Interest accrues (accumulates) on an unsubsidized loan after disbursement. Verification: This is the process to confirm the information you provided on the FAFSA. You will be asked to provide documentation such as a tax transcript. Verification documents can be tracked on Pipeline. Work-study: A form of need-based federal financial aid. Work-study provides students with part-time employment opportunities in a variety of on- and off-campus jobs. Refunds: Your financial aid will be credited to your tuition account to pay for your tuition, fees and any residential housing charges. When these charges are paid, any remaining aid will be refunded to you on your Higher One card, or by check or direct deposit. This excess aid is for you to use for your books, housing, food, transportation and other miscellaneous costs.

The full-service department is available to the university community 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year, with a response time of 90 seconds or less in most situations. All WSU police officers are fully licensed through the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards (MCOLES), are sworn peace officers commissioned under state law, and have been commissioned as Detroit police officers. They are empowered to enforce all federal and state laws as well as the Michigan Motor Vehicle Code and City of Detroit ordinances on and off campus. As sworn police officers, they are authorized to investigate, arrest or take any other necessary action to address any criminal or other public infraction in the vicinity of the WSU campus. WSU police officers work closely with the Detroit Police Department, Wayne County Sheriff's Department, Michigan State Police and federal law enforcement authorities.

Designed so that students can create a network of friends at the beginning of their Wayne State experience, the Freshmen Quest program sends 14 freshmen on a three-day, two-night trip on either Aug. 6-8 or Aug. 13-15. To participate, you'll sign up for the two-credit course during fall 2014 registration and pay a $75 classroom activity fee. A pre-trip meeting the week of departure covers specifics such as what to pack. No need to track down sleeping bags or tents \u2014 those are provided by WSU. Trips are headed up by an upperclassman student leader. WSU staff members accompany the group to teach outdoor skills and guide campfire conversations about college success, touching on topics such as study skills, team building and stress-management. Never been camping? You're not alone. Most participants say they've never participated in the sorts of activities covered during Freshmen Quest. The program was created to expose students to new challenges \u2014 mental and physical. Past participants praise this unique program for helping them make friends, connect with Wayne State, appreciate nature, gain independence and cooperate with others. The canoe and camping trip is just the first part of the program. Students stay connected throughout the fall semester by meeting four times as a group. Classroom sessions elaborate on the lessons learned from the trip, as well as setting students up for a successful college experience.

Parking on campus You'll probably hear a lot about parking at Wayne State. In fact, parking is likely to be at a premium at any university situated in the middle of a bustling city. However, parking at WSU can be very easy. Even when the closest structures and lots are full, there is plenty of perimeter parking with free shuttle service available. The best way to approach parking, and the method that will give you the most peace of mind, is to purchase a semester-long assigned parking pass ($280 for most structures, or $360 for premium parking*). This allows unlimited entry and access to a designated structure or lot, which you'll choose based on availability and where you spend most of your time on campus. Each new parking pass customer will pay a one-time fee ($25*) for an RFID tag, which hangs from your rearview mirror to allow for quick, hands-free entry and exit. The hangtag is linked to your OneCard and all current (and future) parking assignments, so hold on to it throughout your WSU career, even if you take a semester off from assigned parking. General parking is another option, allowing you to pay as you go, with access to any of the general student parking areas. Deposit funds to your OneCard (see page 41) for easy in-and-out access and to take advantage of the discounted student OneCard parking rate of $3.50* ($4.50* for premium parking areas). The general public may park in designated WSU lots and structures at the public rate, typically around $6.50-$7*, using a credit/debit card for entrance and exit and cash at limited locations. Visit parking.wayne.edu to see up-to-the- minute availability of open spots, or check while you're on the go using the Wayne State mobile app. To purchase a pass or get more information, visit parking.wayne.edu and click the Student Parking tab or go to the OneCard/Parking Service Center in room 257 of the Welcome Center. *Based on 2012-13 academic year rates.Midtown Connection Shuttle Wayne State currently offers a complimentary shuttle service that allows you to park your car and get from one part of campus to another simply by showing your OneCard (see page 41).

In 1881, the Detroit Normal Training School was established, which is now the College of Education. The now-iconic Old Main Hall was built in 1896 as Central High School, which began adding college classes in 1913. Those classes evolved into the Detroit Junior College (offering a two-year general education program) in 1917, which became the College of the City of Detroit (with four-year degree programs) in 1923, and now is the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. In 1924, the College of Pharmacy was organized, and six years later the first regular graduate courses were offered in liberal arts and education. Frank Cody became the first president in 1933, with the existing colleges united into a university organization, eventually named Wayne University, taken from Wayne County in honor of General Anthony Wayne. Wayne University continued to grow, adding the School of Social Work, the Law School, and the School of Business Administration. In 1956, it was renamed Wayne State University. In 1963, Wayne State was designated one of Michigan's three constitutionally established universities. Our vision Wayne State University's vision is to become the model public research university engaged in the urban community.Our mission As a nationally recognized urban, public research university, Wayne State's mission is to create knowledge and prepare a diverse body of students to excel in an increasingly complex and global society. Our goals Five specific goals result from Wayne State's strategic vision for the university. These goals articulate its aspirations and provide a framework for the way in which its new plan will be translated into action. Wayne State University has pledged: n to promote an exceptional learning experience. n to improve the university's stature as a nationally ranked research institution. n to nurture a strong and dynamic campus community. n to sustain our role as an engaged university in an urban environment. n to diversify and broaden the university's funding base. Wayne State intends to remain one of the nation's most respected public research universities, and feels that these goals provide a way to make that happen. National recognition is not an end in itself; what matters most is how Wayne State's progress as shaped by these goals will position the university to benefit its students and, ultimately, its city, state, nation and the world.
