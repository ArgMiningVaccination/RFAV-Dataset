This peel is a unique blend of alpha-hydroxy and retinoic acid that creates one of the strongest, but safest and most gentle peels.

Dramatic results are achieved with a series of peels. Spider veins and varicose veins have different causes and different treatments. Esteem specialists can provide treatment options for both. Spider Veins Spider veins\u2014those small clusters of red, blue or purple veins appear for some women on the thighs, calves and ankles and become noticeable at a young age. For others, the veins may not become obvious until much later. A number of factors may contribute to the development of spider veins in the legs: - heredity - hormonal shifts - occupations or activities that require prolonged sitting or standing - pregnancy - weight fluctuation Diminish spider veins from your face or legs, as well as symptoms associated with spider veins, quickly, safely and effectively. Varicose Veins Varicose veins are large, raised, swollen twisted blood vessels that can be seen through the skin's surface. They typically occur more often in women than men, and increase in frequency with age. Up to 60 percent of adults are reported to have varicose veins. Clients with varicose veins complain of different symptoms: - Aching and cramping in the legs - Tiredness, restlessness in the legs - Burning, throbbing and tingling in the legs - Heaviness in the legs Beyond wearing support stockings and making lifestyle changes to ease the swelling and pain, there are effective, minimally invasive procedures to eliminate varicose veins, including endothermal ablation, phlebectomy, and sclerotherapy. In-person consultations with a member of the [Esteem team](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/about/our-team/) can better determine each individual's best option. Sclerotherapy Sclerotherapy is the preferred method for reducing spider veins due to its safety and efficacy. It involves the injection of a solution, called a sclerosant, into the small vessels using an ultra fine needle. The solution irritates the lining of the vessels. This induces the vein walls to stick together so the blood cannot flow through it anymore. Over the next few weeks, the vessel fades from view, eventually becoming barely or not at all visible. Most patients enjoy 50-70% improvement with each treatment session. To get the best results, you may need two or three treatments. External laser treatment can also be used on the surface of the skin for very fine spider veins. The small bursts of light make small veins disappear. The experts at Esteem will combine sclerotherapy and laser to offer you the best possible results.

Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pa. - Fellowship: Craniofacial Surgery, University of Toronto, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto What is a thigh lift? A thigh lift surgically reshapes thighs by reducing excess skin and fat, resulting in smoother skin and better-proportioned contours of the thighs and lower body. Thigh lifts are not intended strictly for the removal of excess fat. In cases where skin elasticity is poor, a thigh lift, along with liposuction, may be recommended to remove excess fat deposits where skin has good elasticity and is able to naturally conform to new body contours. Ideal candidates for thigh lift procedures include: - Those with relatively stable weight - Those with excess soft tissue along the inner or outer thigh - No other medical conditions that would challenge recovery - Non-smokers - Those committed to leading healthy lifestyles with appropriate diet and exercise. Results of thigh lift procedures are almost immediately visible, but longer lasting results may take a few months to fully develop. Overall results are typically long-lasting. Body and Breast Services Whether looking to achieve a renewed shape or accentuate your naturally beautiful self, the body and breast services of Esteem Penn State Health Cosmetic Associates provide various options for both breast and body procedures. Facial Treatments Look youthful and feel more confident by enhancing your natural features. Skin Therapies Skin rejuvenation and resurfacing treatments range from restoring healthy skin with daily preventive skin care while sustaining a healthier lifestyle to physically removing the top layer of skin with procedures and treatments, such as lasers and chemical peels. Men's Services The Esteem Penn State Health Cosmetic Associates team of compassionate and skilled aesthetic professionals is committed to understanding the specific needs and concerns of its male clients. As many as 25 percent of people with tattoos report being less than happy with that decision. Individuals considering tattoo removal should contact a member of the Esteem team to schedule an in-person consultation to best evaluate the options for removal. Good candidates for tattoo removal are those with medium-to-fair skin and tattoo(s) containing dark, but not dense, ink that is not too deep. Medium and fair skinned people react well, because the laser can selectively target ink. For tattoos on a spot with good circulation (arms, chest, buttocks), individuals should see results fairly quickly. Areas with poor circulation (ankles, fingers) are a bit more of a challenge. Although laser tattoo removal can be uncomfortable, our physicians utilize a combination of topical or injected anesthesia to ensure the procedure is well tolerated. Complete removal of tattoos will typically take several treatments with each treatment helping the tattoo to fade.

Spider veins\u2014those small clusters of red, blue, or purple veins\u2014can appear on the thighs, calves, and ankles and may become noticeable at a young age; for others, these veins may not become obvious until much later. Aside from their potentially unsightly appearance, spider veins are typically harmless. A number of factors may contribute to the development of spider veins in the legs: - heredity - hormonal shifts - occupations or activities that require prolonged sitting or standing - pregnancy - weight fluctuation The Esteem team of professionals offers individuals options to diminish spider veins from the face or legs quickly, safely, and effectively. Illuminize Peel\u00ae The Illuminize Peel is appropriate for first-time peel clients. It is a gentle, superficial facial peel that tightens skin and increases radiance and glow while improving clarity, color and texture; restores a more youthful appearance with very little, if any, visible peeling. Rejuvenize Peel The Rejuvenize Peel is a professional grade, deep-action chemical peel to help minimize the effects sun damage, melasma, acne scarring and fine wrinkles. It penetrates deep into the surface layers of the skin, and begins working almost instantly to deliver even, radical exfoliation and expose fresher, more beautiful looking skin in as little as one treatment. The Rejuvenize Peel is specially formulated to provide the most dramatic results possible while maintaining minimal downtime and discomfort. If over-the-counter skin care products have left you disappointed for the treatment of fine wrinkles, minor blemishes, rough, sun-damaged skin or acne scars, then a Rejuvenize Peel treatment may be just what you need! Vitalize Peel\u00ae The Vitalize Peel offers a unique blend of mild acids and cosmeceutical ingredients to provide a complete and safe peel, gentle enough to use every three weeks. Improves skin tone and texture, fades age spots, minimizes and lessens superficial lines, reduces large pores and pigmentation irregularities, as well as stimulates collagen production. This unique blend of alpha-hydroxy and retinoic acid creates one of the strongest, but safest and most gentle peels; more dramatic results are achieved following multiple treatments. Two to three days following this peel, mild to moderate flaking will occur, but can be controlled with moisturizers. Acne and Acne Scarring The Esteem Penn State Health Cosmetic Associates team takes great pride in the treatment of teen and adult acne. To begin, the process starts with a complimentary consultation to analyze the client's skin. This allows the experts to customize an acne treatment program. Acne occurs when pores (tiny holes on the surface of the skin) become clogged. - Each pore opens to a follicle that contains a hair and an oil gland. The oil released by the gland helps remove old skin cells and keeps skin soft. - When glands produce too much oil, pores become blocked. Dirt, bacteria and inflammatory cells build-up. The blockage is called a plug or comedone. - When top of the plug is white, it is called a whitehead. - When the top of the plug is dark, it is called a blackhead. - If it breaks open, it is followed by swelling and the appearance of red bumps. Acne deep in the skin can cause hard, painful cysts called nodulocystic acne. Although acne often diminishes after the teenage years, it can last into middle age. The condition often responds well to treatment after six to eight weeks, but may flare-up from time to time. Scarring occurs when severe acne is not treated. Rosacea Patients with the condition called 'rosacea' typically report a slow progression of symptoms, such as broken vessels in the cheeks and on the nose, small round bumps and a dry, ruddy appearance of the skin. Rosacea treatments begin with an understanding of what triggers the flare-ups and developing a strategy to avoid those triggers. Only high-quality and very gentle products should be used on the skin; it is important to identify anti-inflammatory products that help with the treatment of rosacea. Rosacea Symptoms: - Redness of the face - Blushing or flushing easily - Many spider-like blood vessels (telangiectasia) of the face - A red nose (called a 'bulbous nose') - Acne-like skin sores that may ooze or crust - Burning or stinging feeling in the face - Irritated, bloodshot, watery eyes Melasma Melasma is a common skin disorder that most often appears in young women with brownish skin tone, but can affect anyone. Melasma is often associated with the female hormones estrogen and progesterone, and is typically common with pregnancy, when using birth control pills (oral contraceptives), and if using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause. Melasma Symptoms: Skin color changes that most often appear an even brown color, typically appearing on the cheeks, forehead, nose or upper lip; symmetrical dark patches. Skin Therapies Skin Rejuvenation/Resurfacing What is skin rejuvenation and resurfacing? Skin rejuvenation and resurfacing treatments range from restoring healthy skin with daily preventive skin care while sustaining a healthier lifestyle to physically removing the top layer of skin with procedures and treatments, such as lasers and chemical peels. Skin rejuvenation and resurfacing may treat various conditions: [Rosacea](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/skin-therapies-treatments/#rosacea), excessive redness and 'flushing' of inflamed and visible blood vessels - Large pores; fine wrinkles - Common skin blemishes and textural irregularities, including [acne and acne scarring](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/skin-therapies-treatments/) - Uneven pigmentation, including freckles and \"sun spots\" or other darkened skin patches - Loss of skin tone, firmness and cellulite - Dynamic wrinkles, known as expression lines, that may appear as folds when the skin is not moving and deepen with facial movements or expressions [Melasma](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/skin-therapies-treatments/#melasma)/hyperpigmentation - Specialized laser treatment may be added to your treatment strategy for this difficult condition to help with pigment removal and skin resurfacing.

The procedure involves the injection of a solution, called a sclerosant, into the small vessels using an ultra-fine needle. The solution irritates the lining of the vessels. This induces the vein walls to stick together so the blood cannot flow through those veins anymore. Over the next few weeks, the vessels fade from view, eventually becoming barely or not at all visible. Most patients enjoy 50-70% improvement with each treatment session. Depending on the size and number of veins being treated, multiple sessions may be needed to achieve maximum results. Sclerotherapy can be scheduled at the Esteem office in Harrisburg and do not require anesthesia. Appointments typically take less than one hour to complete, and you will be permitted to resume usual activities (including driving home), immediately afterward. Veins that respond to this treatment typically do not return, but new veins may appear in time. In addition, external laser treatment can be used on the surface of the skin for very fine spider veins. The small bursts of light make small veins disappear. The experts at Esteem can combine sclerotherapy and laser to offer the best possible results for each individual. Scars are visible signs that remain after a wound has healed. They may be noticeable, due to size, shape or location; they can also be raised or depressed and may differ in color or texture from the surrounding healthy tissue. Scars are the unavoidable results of injury or surgery their development can be unpredictable. Poor healing may contribute to scars that are obvious, unsightly or disfiguring. Even a wound that heals well may result in a scar that affects appearance significantly. Scar revision procedures attempt to minimize scars, so that they are less conspicuous and blend in with the surrounding skin tone and texture. Treatment options vary based on the type and degree of scarring: - simple topical treatments - minimally invasive procedures - surgical revision with advanced techniques in wound closure Scar reversion is very individualized and each client is different.

When PRP is injected in the scalp, the platelets are activated and can then release several growth factors that promote hair growth. The known growth factors in PRP include: - Epidermal growth factor - Transforming growth factor - Vascular endothelial growth factor - Fibroblast growth factor - Platelet-derived growth Factor - Insulin-like growth factor Disadvantages - Minimal risk of allergic reaction or rejection - Some injection discomfort - Results can vary - Insurance will not cover the cost of the treatments The Procedure - Blood is drawn from a vein in the arm by a medical professional. The amount is similar to basic lab tests. - The blood is placed into a centrifuge, which spins the blood and separates the components. - A medical professional extracts the platelets using a syringe. - A doctor injects the platelets into appropriate areas of the scalp. Treatment Schedule This treatment requires several spaced appointments. The treatment intervals should include: - Monthly sessions for the first three months - Six months after the last treatment - Nine months after that for maintenance Maintenance routines will vary between individuals. It is important to know that PRP is not a cure for male and female pattern hair loss. Results The results of PRP will vary from individual to individual, and PRP does not work for everyone. Typically, patients still need to continue their medical therapy to maximize their results. It is important to understand that hair growth will take time. Considering plastic surgery? Plastic surgery has become increasingly more popular with men. The American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery recently reported an impressive 325 percent increase in male plastic surgery since the late 1990s. Evolving attitudes and newer technologies in aesthetic medicine have made it more appealing for men to consider cosmetic plastic surgery and non-surgical aesthetic enhancements as a way to improve their appearance and gain more confidence. Popular plastic surgery options for men: [Chin and jaw augmentation](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/chinjaw-augmentation/) [Eyelid surgery](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/blepharoplastyeyelift/) [Liposuction](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/liposuction/) [Nose reshaping (rhinoplasty)](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/nose-reshapingrhinoplasty/) - Male breast reduction Plastic or cosmetic surgery is performed using a variety of techniques to refine and enhance an individual's features. A personal consultation to discuss skin history, consider appropriate treatments and products, and to define skin care goals with an Esteem team member will help to best determine next steps. Male Breast Reduction Surgery What is involved with male breast reduction? More than 200,000 cases of gynecomastia, the appearance of larger breasts in males, are reported each year. Some boys and men are bothered by the appearance of excess fat and breast tissue. They report being self-conscious and, as a result, avoid taking off their shirts in public, like at the beach. Male breast reduction surgery, or subcutaneous mastectomy, could be a solution to resolve this issue. It removes extra breast tissue and fat providing a more sculpted look to the male chest. Today's advanced techniques offer men a permanent solution to restore a naturally masculine appearance with short surgery and quick recovery. There are several techniques for the reduction of enlarged male breasts\u2014such as liposuction, direct areolar tissue reduction surgery with a short scar near the nipple, and full breast reduction surgery with scars around the nipple and along the chest (for very droopy breasts, such as those in massive weight loss clients). Full results are typically seen within a few weeks. the removal of thickened outer layers of skin improving skin imperfections, such as fine lines and pigmentation irregularities; some visible peeling may occur. Micro Peel Plus Micro Peel Plus helps to diminish fine lines, uneven pigmentation, acne and environmental damage by stimulating cell turnover with salicylic acid application; some peeling may occur a few days following application. Light Refresh Peel A light refresh peel improves the texture and appearance of the skin by increasing cell turnover. It relieves skin congestion, dullness, sallowness and improves acne with no downtime. Ultra-gentle lactic peel For thin, fragile and sensitive skin types, there is the ultra-gentle lactic peel alternative to provide excellent exfoliation with little to no visible peeling.

[View full profile](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/staff/nina-shirley-ma/) What is rhinoplasty? Rhinoplasty (nose reshaping) enhances facial harmony and the proportions of the nose. Rhinoplasty may successfully treat nose aesthetics, such as: - Nose size in relation to facial balance - Nose width at the bridge or in the size and position of the nostrils - Nose profile with visible humps or depressions on the bridge - Nasal tip that is enlarged or bulbous, drooping, upturned or hooked - Nasal asymmetry If a more symmetrical nose is desired, keep in mind that everyone's face is asymmetric to some degree. Results may not be completely symmetric, although the goal is to create facial balance and correct proportion. What is septoplasty? Septoplasty, which can be performed in conjunction with rhinoplasty, can correct impaired breathing caused by structural defects in the nose, such as a deviated septum or broken nose. Nose surgery performed to improve an obstructed airway requires careful evaluation of the nasal structure as it relates to airflow and breathing. Correction of a deviated septum, one of the most common causes of breathing impairment, is achieved by adjusting the nasal structure to produce better alignment. Nina Shirley has been with Penn State Health since 2014. She began her career as a medical assistant in pediatrics, where she worked for 14 years. She believes that at Esteem patients can receive all of the best services in one place. Expertise: Plastic and reconstructive surgery and dermatology What is a neck lift? A neck lift, or lower rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure that improves visible signs of aging in the jawline and neck. Neck lift surgery may successfully treat these conditions: - Excessive fat and skin relaxation of the lower cheeks that create jowls - Unwanted fatty deposits under the chin - Loose, hanging neck skin - Muscle banding in the neck, creating abnormal contours The loss of youthful shape in the face and neck can be due to a variety of factors, including heredity, gravity, environmental conditions and stress. Some people feel they are not ready for a full [face lift](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/facelift/), because the upper face still looks youthful. However, many clients notice excess wrinkling of the neck skin, a double chin or \"turkey wattle\" and jowl lines. When the neck area doesn't match the upper facial appearance, a neck lift may be a reasonable option. Other procedures that may be performed in combination with a neck lift: - A [brow lift](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/browlift/)to correct sagging or deeply furrowed brows - Fat transfers to add fullness to the lips and cheeks, as well as reduce the appearance of wrinkles [Eyelid surgery](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/blepharoplastyeyelift/)to rejuvenate aging eyes [Chin augmentation](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/chinjaw-augmentation/) [Rhinoplasty](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/nose-reshapingrhinoplasty/), as a \"nose job\" or \"nose reshaping\" What does neck lift surgery not do? As a restorative surgery, a neck lift does not change an individual's fundamental appearance and cannot stop the aging process. A neck lift can only be performed surgically; nonsurgical rejuvenation treatments do not achieve the same results, but may help delay the time when a neck lift becomes appropriate and complement the results of surgery. Enjoy the exfoliation benefits of microdermabrasion and non-invasive laser technology. Laser genesis skin therapy gently heats the dermis below the skin's surface to stimulate collagen growth. This treatment can safely and discreetly treat sun damage and scars, and diffuse excessive redness. Large pores are reduced and fine lines and wrinkles are diminished. With each treatment, clients see subtle and consistent results without skin irritation. For more dramatic results, multiple treatments are recommended (average four to six treatments). A spray of fine crystals removes the outer layer of skin to promote changes in skin texture, color and appearance. Microdermabrasion can help to treat fine lines, uneven skin color, clogged pores, blackheads and dull skin. Following treatment, clients can immediately return to their daily routines. Microdermabrasion helps with various issues: - Improve age spots and hyperpigmentation - Lessens appearance of stretch marks - Reduces fine lines, wrinkles and enlarged pores - Treats acne and acne scars - Exfoliates skin to reveal refreshed appearance Microdermabrasion helps to build collagen for younger, smoother appearance. Cell turnover is stimulated with the application of salicylic acid. Micro Peel Plus helps to diminish fine lines, uneven pigmentation, acne and environmental damage. After the peel, skin may be pink and sensitive for a few days. Some peeling may occur two to three days after the peel.

For individuals who are bothered by excess fat deposits anywhere on the body that have not responded to diet and exercise options up to now, liposuction may be worth considering. What is liposuction? Liposuction removes fat deposits from specific areas resistant to exercise and diet, including the abdomen, hips, buttocks, thighs, knees, upper arms, chest, chin, cheeks and neck, as well as calves and ankles. In recent years, liposuction techniques have improved offering safer, easier and less painful treatments. Ideal liposuction candidates: - adults within 30 percent of their ideal body weight who have firm, elastic skin and good muscle tone - healthy individuals who do not have a life-threatening illness or medical conditions that can impair healing - non-smokers - individuals with a positive outlook and specific goals in mind for body contouring In conjunction with liposuction, other procedures may be performed: facelift, breast reduction or tummy tuck. Liposuction is not a treatment for obesity, a substitute for proper diet and exercise, or an effective treatment for cellulite. It is used to reshape one or more areas of the body, but not to reduce weight. If fitness and weight control efforts have not helped clients to achieve their goals for a firmer, more youthful-looking body and more proportionate overall body image, a surgical lift may be worth consideration. Lasers are useful because of their incredible selectivity in the treatment of unwanted skin conditions. They can penetrate to a target within the skin, such as a spider vein or a tattoo ink particle, while causing little damage to surrounding tissues. Although lasers are powerful devices, the best results are seen after multiple treatments. Lasers available: HALO Laser Treatment HALO is a hybrid fractional laser that targets skin damage and restores the skin's natural glow. The topmost layers of skin are exfoliated while thermal wavelengths stimulate deep collagen and elastin production. HALO can be used to treat the following with great results and minimal downtime: - Discoloration - Sun damage - Visible signs of aging - Uneven skin tone - Enlarged pores - Poor texture Forever Young BBL Forever Young BBL is a preventive regimen that rejuvenates the skin and provides a more youthful appearance. This innovative technology take years off your face while reducing the effects of time and sun exposure. Forever Young BBL is used to treat: - Age spots - Sun damage - Small blood vessels Forever Clear BBL Forever Clear BBL is a cutting-edge acne treatment that uses the power of light to comfortably and effectively clear acne without creams or medicines.

Forever Clear BBL treats: - Acne - Acne scarring Forever Bare Hair Removal Forever Bare BBL uses revolutionary technology to evenly heat hair follicles, reducing the chances of missing areas that occur with traditional treatments. The result is hair removal that's more comfortable, safer and typically faster. Forever Bare can be used to treat any area of the body with unwanted hair. Enjoy permanent hair reduction from your face, legs, underarms, back and bikini-line. What is laser hair removal? As one of the most common aesthetic procedures in the nation, laser hair removal is a noninvasive technique that uses highly concentrated light to penetrate hair follicles. The laser light is absorbed by the pigment in the hair shaft in the follicle\u2014generating heat that damages the follicle to inhibit future hair growth. It provides smoother results than waxing, electrolysis and shaving. Because laser hair removal only affects actively growing hair follicles, it may take several laser hair removal treatments to provide significant hair reduction. Plucking hair before treatment reduces the effectiveness of the laser treatment as the target is absent. Additionally, while laser hair removal effectively slows hair growth, it doesn't guarantee permanent hair removal. Periodic maintenance treatments may be needed. This is a gentle hair removal option that can treat larger areas effectively with minimal discomfort and no downtime. Results Most clients achieve permanent hair loss after an average of three to eight sessions.

Injectables minimize facial wrinkling with wrinkle correction treatments, such as those listed on this site. Injectables Botox\u00ae Cosmetic What is Botox Cosmetic? Botox is a purified natural protein toxin that, in small doses, blocks the nerve impulses to muscles and reduces frown lines caused by facial muscles pulling. How does Botox Cosmetic work? Frown lines are caused from facial muscle contraction causing the skin to bunch and creating a constant furrow, or frown line. Injecting Botox Cosmetic directly into the facial muscle weakens it and stops muscles from being able to draw the eyebrows together when an individual frowns. The action of frowning is stopped, the frown lines soften, relax and diminish, and give a more youthful appearance. When does Botox Cosmetic start to work, and how long does it last? The results of each Botox Cosmetic treatment begin to appear in three to four days. The effect will last three to four months, after which the treated muscles gradually regain their action and a simple repeat treatment is all that is necessary to maintain the desired results. What are the other uses of Botox Cosmetic? Botox Cosmetic effectively relaxes and softens wrinkles around the eyes, such as crow's feet and forehead wrinkles. Botox Cosmetic can also reduce the appearance of lines that are caused by other facial muscles, such as nose creases, neck lines, neck bands and some of the lines on the upper lip. In addition, Botox Cosmetic can dramatically reduce excessive underarm sweating, hypohydrosis, and is also effective in controlling marked sweating from the palms of the hands. Who can perform Botox Cosmetic treatments? Botox Cosmetic therapy should only be performed under the direction of a physician experienced and trained for its cosmetic use. Has Botox Cosmetic been tested and approved? There have been many scientific articles showing the positive effect of Botox Cosmetic on facial lines. In 2002, the FDA approved Botox Cosmetic for the cosmetic treatment of frown lines in the mid face, known as glabellar furrows. Botox Cosmetic has also been used since 1980 for the treatment of strabismus (lazy eye) and blepharospasm (uncontrolled eye blinking). Since 1989, it has been used for hyperfunctional facial lines. What possible side effects can occur with Botox Cosmetic? As with any injection, there can be temporary swelling, redness, bruising, headache or local discomfort. Rarely, clients have been reported to temporarily develop a slight lowering of the eyelid (ptosis), or slight lowering of the forehead, resolving within a few weeks. Some clients may have an uneven or incomplete response to treatment. Botox Cosmetic does not reduce the action of the muscles of facial expression distant from the site of treatment. Clients with neuromuscular disorders should inform their doctors before therapy. Botox Cosmetic treatment should not be used on pregnant women. Dermal Fillers What are dermal fillers? Dermal fillers help to diminish facial lines and restore volume and fullness in the face. With age, faces naturally lose fat under the skin. The facial muscles then work closer to the skin surface making smile lines and crow's feet more apparent. The facial skin also stretches, adding to this loss of facial volume. Other factors that affect the facial skin include sun exposure, heredity and lifestyle. What dermal fillers do: - Decrease or remove the shadow of the lower lids - Enhance shallow contours - Improve the appearance of recessed scars - Plump thin lips - Reconstruct contour deformities in the face - Soften facial creases and wrinkles Dermal fillers can be very helpful in those with early signs of aging, or as a value-added part of facial rejuvenation surgery. What dermal fillers cannot do: For some clients, surgery, such as a facelift, browlift or eyelift, may be the best approach. Nonsurgical rejuvenation treatments, such as soft tissue fillers, cannot achieve the same results, but may help delay the time when consideration of a facelift becomes appropriate. It is important to remember that dermal fillers are temporary treatments for facial aging and that ongoing treatments are needed for long-term results. Belotero Balance\u00ae What is Belotero Balance? Belotero Balance is an FDA-approved hyaluronic acid injectable filler used to temporarily smooth and fill moderate-to-severe folds or wrinkles from the side of the nose to the corner of the mouth. What does Belotero Balance do? Belotero Balance is a soft and cohesive gel that, once injected, instantly fills the skin to help smooth moderate-to-severe lines and wrinkles. It fills in areas within the skin to reduce the depth of wrinkles, lines and folds. The skin remains mobile and flexible, with a natural look, feel and movement. How is Belotero Balance administered? With a fine-gauge needle, a licensed professional injects Belotero Balance into the skin. Clients can either sit or recline during treatment. The aftercare is minimal. Is Belotero Balance painful? As with all injectable treatments, there may be discomfort associated with the procedure, but the professionals at Esteem can discuss effective options for managing discomfort during treatment. Clients may experience injection site reactions. These reactions can include inflammation and usually last less than seven days. How long do Belotero Balance results last? Individual results vary, but Belotero Balance is said to last approximately six months and sometimes longer, depending on the amount of product used and the specific area where it is injected. For example, areas with more movement due to eating, talking and smiling, the product may not last as long as other less active areas. What side effects can occur with Belotero Balance? Just like any injection, clients may experience mild irritation, swelling, itching, redness, bruising or tenderness at the injection site. These side effects typically resolve themselves within a few days. If any side effects persist for more than seven days, the doctor should be contacted immediately. Juv\u00e9derm\u00ae What is Juv\u00e9derm? Juv\u00e9derm is an injectable gel made of hyaluronic acid (HA). It is used by cosmetic dermatologists to restore volume creating a smooth, natural, youthful look. As we age, our face loses volume and we begin to see facial folds and wrinkles, better known as smile lines. What does Juv\u00e9derm do? Juv\u00e9derm temporarily adds new volume to sagging skin and fills in hollow spaces on the face, giving a fuller, smoother and more youthful appearance. How is Juv\u00e9derm administered? A cosmetic dermatologist uses a very fine needle to inject the Juv\u00e9derm into mid-to-deep layers of skin to correct moderate-to-severe facial wrinkles and folds. Once injected into the skin, HA helps to create new collagen and stops the breakdown of existing collagen. Is Juv\u00e9derm painful? Injections may cause some discomfort during and after the injection. Juv\u00e9derm's gel consistency allows the doctor to administer it easily and smoothly. And, with a fine needle for minimal injection discomfort, Juv\u00e9derm is injected directly into the skin. Doctors may choose to numb (anesthetize) the treatment area to further minimize discomfort. How long is the individual Juv\u00e9derm injection process? The injection process takes only about 15 minutes. Clients should also allow time to consult with the doctor, prior to treatment. How long do Juv\u00e9derm results last? Juv\u00e9derm is the only FDA-approved HA filler that lasts up to a year. Touch-up injections, as well as repeat injections, are usually needed to maintain optimal corrections. Can people with different skin tones and colors be treated with Juv\u00e9derm? Yes. In fact, Juv\u00e9derm injectable gel is the first FDA-approved HA dermal filler that has proven its safety and effectiveness in persons of color. Studies with Juv\u00e9derm showed no increased risk of hyperpigmentation or hypertrophic scarring in clients of color. What side effects can occur with Juv\u00e9derm injectable gel? Most side effects are mild or moderate in nature. The duration is typically brief (seven days or fewer). The most common side effects include, but are not limited to, discoloration and temporary injections site reactions, such as redness, pain and tenderness, firmness, swelling, lumps and bumps, bruising or itching. As with all skin injection procedures, there is a risk of infection. Juv\u00e9derm Voluma\u00ae What is Juv\u00e9derm Voluma? Voluma, from the Juv\u00e9derm family of products, is a dermal filler treatment made of hyaluronic acid (HA), a substance naturally occurring in the body that aids in providing skin elasticity lost with age. What makes Voluma unique is that it is used specifically to restore volume loss in larger areas of the face than other fillers. Its thick gel consistency and unique formulation allow it to be injected deeply into hollow areas with a small needle. It is a smooth, pliable gel filler that produces even, consistent results. The results of Voluma injections are seen immediately and studies have indicated the results are long-lasting (up to 18 months with a treatment regimen). Voluma is most commonly used for volume restoration in the following areas: - Cheeks - Cheekbones - Chin and jawline - Temples Voluma offers non-surgical options for smooth chin and cheekbone augmentation results. Clients looking for stronger cheekbones or a more prominent chin can achieve natural-looking, temporary results with Voluma injections by an expert. Although the results are temporary, clients can return for touch-up injections to maintain their desired look. How is Voluma different from other dermal fillers? Voluma is the only dermal filler made specifically to address volume loss in the cheeks, chin and jawline. The HA works with collagen and elastin to produce smooth, plump results instantly, and has been shown to have long-lasting results. Do Voluma injections hurt? Dermal filler injections typically do not cause pain. Voluma, specifically, contains a small amount of lidocaine, which numbs the treatment area as it is injected. Each client should discuss any concerns and questions with the board-certified dermatologist who is performing the injection, beforehand. The doctor can also apply a topical numbing cream to the skin, prior to injection. How long do Voluma results last? All dermal filler treatment results vary from one client to the next. However, clients who have had Voluma treatments report that the results do last longer\u2014up to 18 months for many clients who follow a treatment regimen. Does Voluma address wrinkles? Voluma is indicated for severe volume loss treatment and works best when injected deep under the skin to fill in hollow areas. Other dermal fillers, such as Restylane, Juv\u00e9derm and Belotero may be better options for minimizing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles that are more superficial. The Esteem professionals can develop a liquid facelift treatment plan to best meet each client's needs. The liquid facelift includes a combination of injectable treatments to address all problem areas. What are the side effects associated with Voluma? Although Voluma is well-tolerated by most individuals, as with any injectable treatment, there are potential side effects including, but not limited to, bruising, swelling, redness or itching after treatment. These should not last longer than a few days. For side effects lasting longer than a week, the doctor should be contacted for further evaluation. Kybella What is Kybella (Deoxycholic acid) injection? Say Goodbye to Your Double Chin for Good with Kybella Kybella injection is the first and only FDA-approved injectable drug that contours and improves the appearance of a double chin, due to fat deposition beneath the chin. Kybella is a naturally occurring substance, deoxycholic acid, which aids in the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat. Kybella is indicated for improvement in the appearance of moderate-to-severe fullness associated with fat beneath the chin in adults. What is a double chin and 'submental' fullness? Fat deposits below the chin lead to the appearance of a \"double chin,\" which is a common, yet undertreated facial aesthetic condition. It can detract from an otherwise balanced and harmonious facial appearance, leading to an older and heavier look. It is not limited to people who are overweight. This condition can impact men or women of average weight and can be caused by aging, genetics and weight gain. It is often resistant to diet and exercise alone. How does Kybella work? Kybella is a non-human and non-animal formulation of deoxycholic acid, a naturally-occurring molecule in the body that helps with the breakdown and absorption of dietary fat. When injected into subcutaneous fat, Kybella causes the destruction of fat cells. Once destroyed, those cells cannot store or accumulate fat. How is Kybella administered? - Kybella is injected into the fat under the chin. - Each in-office treatment session is typically 15-20 minutes. - Treatment with Kybella is customized by the physician to the client's aesthetic goals for an improved chin profile. What are the results of Kybella? Many clients experience visible results in two to four treatments and have typically reported high satisfaction. Is Kybella safe? Kybella has been the focus of a global clinical development program involving more than 20 clinical studies and 2,600 clients worldwide. Kybella contains no human or animal-derived substances. The safe and effective use of Kybella for the treatment of fat outside the chin region has not been established and is not recommended Restylane\u00ae What is Restylane? Restylane is the world's best-selling dermal filler, providing rejuvenating cosmetic beauty treatments for a natural, younger-looking face. It is well-tolerated, nonsurgical and long lasting (usually around six months). Hyaluronic acid and how skin ages Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a naturally occurring substance in skin that helps to provide fullness and elasticity. Over time, skin loses HA and, as a result, volume. When skin loses volume, it increases the chances for wrinkles and folds to appear. There's no stopping it; skin changes with age. But the good news is, there's something that can be done about it. Here are the Facts: - Young skin is smooth and full. - Restylane is injected into the skin to restore volume to correct moderate-to-severe facial wrinkles and folds, such as the lines from the nose to the corners of your mouth (nasolabial folds). Restylane gives natural-looking results an FDA-approved injectable that addresses the underlying cause of facial aging\u2014lost collagen\u2014not just the symptoms: smile lines between the nose and mouth, laugh lines surrounding the mouth; chin wrinkles. Sculptra Aesthetic helps gradually replace lost collagen for results that can last more than two years.* Not all treatments or injectables are created the same, nor do they target the same areas of the face. Sculptra Aesthetic is more effective than collagen creams and dietary collagen, which are not well absorbed. What are the results of Sculptra Aesthetic injections? With Sculptra Aesthetic, results appear gradually over the treatment regime (typically three injections over the course of three to four months) and can last up to two years.* *Individual results and treatment sessions may vary. Clinical trial ended at 25 months. How does Sculptra Aesthetic work? As a poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA) collagen stimulator, Sculptra Aesthetic works with the body, rather than topically, to help revitalize collagen production and help restore skin's inner structure and volume. As Sculptra Aesthetic is absorbed, it stimulates collagen production. Rebuilt collagen strands gradually help to restore facial volume and the look of fullness to wrinkles and folds. For a more youthful appearance \u2014 without any obvious or extreme appearance changes \u2014 Sculptra Aesthetic can provide another alternative to surgery. How is it administered? The specialist injects treatment within the deep dermis, where strands of collagen support the skin's structure. Over time, Sculptra Aesthetic helps the body reproduce lost collagen. On average, three injection appointments over a period of a few months are necessary for maximum results. The number of injection appointments and the number of injections per appointment vary from person to person, depending on how much collagen has been lost. Safety and side effects of Sculptra Aesthetic Sculptra Aesthetic is FDA-approved in the U.S. and has been used worldwide since 1999. Though allergy testing is not required prior to treatment, individuals should not use Sculptra Aesthetic if they are allergic to any of its ingredients. In addition, clients should not go through treatment if they have an active skin infection or inflammation in the treatment area, or with a history or susceptibility to keloid formation or hypertrophic scarring. Sculptra Aesthetic should be injected into the deep dermis. Superficial injections may be associated with small bumps and larger lumps under the skin in the treated area. In a clinical study, a few clients reported these bumps and lumps, but none of these events were reported as serious adverse events by the investigator.

When to consider fat transfer options: - The appearance of sunken or creased facial features - Desire for more long-lasting results than temporary fillers - To improve and rejuvenate body contour, scars and other bodily depressions - For breast reconstruction; fills-in contours and hides obvious signs of implants Ideal candidates for fat transfer procedures should not have any circulation issues and should be non-smokers. A consultation with a member of the Esteem team will help determine best options based on several factors: - personal goals - desired downtime and recovery - body type and physical characteristics What is a face lift? A face lift, or rhytidectomy, is a surgical procedure that improves visible signs of aging in the face and neck and treats various other issues: - Sagging facial skin - Visible fold lines between the nose and corner of the mouth - Fat that has reduced or disappeared - A double chin - Loose hanging neck skin resembling a \"turkey neck\" The loss of youthful appearance in the face can be due to a variety of factors, including thinning of the skin, loss of facial fat, gravity, sun damage and smoking, along with heredity and stress. Other procedures that may be performed in combination with a face lift: - A brow lift and eyelid surgery can rejuvenate aging eyes. - Fat transfers or fillers to replace lost fatty volume. - Skin treatments, such as intense pulse light (IPL), dermabrasion, peels or laser to improve the quality and texture of the skin. What does face lift surgery not do? As a restorative surgery, a face lift does not change your fundamental appearance and cannot stop the aging process. A face lift can only be performed surgically; nonsurgical rejuvenation treatments do not achieve the same results, but may help delay the time when a face lift becomes appropriate and complement the results of surgery. Facial Rejuvenation Look youthful and feel more confident by enhancing your natural features. A face lift, neck lift, brow lift or eyelid surgery can help to improve visible signs of aging. A chin augmentation, nose or ear reshaping can provide well-defined and more balanced features.

Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pa. Changes in the vagina can happen as the body ages, but childbirth, menopause and some medical procedures can contribute to pain, dryness and urinary incontinence. Esteem offers a quick, nonsurgical, in-office procedure to help address a woman's most intimate challenges. How does it work? diVa\u00ae utilizes hybrid fractional laser technology to rebuild and rejuvenate vaginal tissue. Its unique design delivers two laser beams at once to the wall of the vaginal canal. The first laser deeply resurfaces the tissue layers, which stimulates the growth of new, healthy tissue. The second laser heats the layers where collagen exists. Together, this increases the thickness of the vaginal walls and rebuilds the structural support tissues of the vagina and those that support the bladder. What does it treat? - Vaginal atrophy - Vaginal laxity - Urinary incontinence Benefits of diVa\u00ae laser therapy: - Quick, in-office procedure - Most treatments are pain-free - Little to no downtime Who is an ideal candidate for laser vaginal therapy? Any woman who is concerned about vaginal health after menopause, childbirth, chemotherapy, breastfeeding, hysterectomy or chemotherapy, or who would like to reclaim her sexual health and/or have a non-surgical option for urinary incontinence. What to expect during treatment The laser treatment procedure takes about three to five minutes. While doctors can use a topical anesthetic, most treatments are pain-free. How many treatments are recommended? Three laser treatments are given every 4 to 6 weeks, followed by one maintenance treatment every 12 months. How long is recovery? With a diVa\u00ae treatment, there is little to no downtime. After your procedure, you can return to your daily routine, although your doctor may ask you to avoid sexual intercourse for 48 hours. Dermaplaning uses a hand-held instrument to carefully remove dead layers of skin, as well as fine \"peach fuzz\" (fine, light-colored facial hairs); shedding lackluster layers of skin helps to restore a healthier look and feel to the overall complexion. Recommended for the following issues: - To reduce \"peach fuzz\" - fine, light-colored facial hair - Exfoliation to leave skin silky smooth What to expect (there is no downtime with this procedure): - Skin is thoroughly cleansed, prior to treatment. - Skin is gently scraped to remove dead skin layers. - To finish, a sunscreen is applied. - Skin glows. Dermabrasion helps to refinish the top layers of skin by controlled surgical scraping giving the skin a smoother appearance. This procedure is most often used on facial skin left scarred by accidents or previous surgery, as well as to remove pre-cancerous growths. Recovery Skin will be fairly red and swollen following dermabrasion treatment. A scab forms over the treated area as it begins to heal. Beneath the scab, a new layer of tight skin is forming. Recovery typically lasts several weeks for dermabrasion. This can offer dramatic results, but will take some time before final results are seen. What is cosmetic ear surgery? Cosmetic ear surgery, also known as otoplasty or ear pinning, surgically reshapes the ears. The cartilage is shaped using internal stitches or sculpting techniques and small incisions behind the ears. Cosmetic ear surgery may successfully treat these conditions: - Large, prominent ears that are further from the head than preferred - Abnormal shape or position of the outer ear, \"lop\" or low-set ears - Self-consciousness or embarrassment over unusually shape of ears Earlobe Reduction/Repair Earlobe repairs may be performed to correct elongation of piercings or complete earlobe clefts (torn earlobes), caused by an earring tearing out. As we age, ear lobes become longer and longer. Earlobe reduction may quickly restore a youthful appearance. Shortening of the earlobes produce a very inconspicuous scar. The entire face typically looks rejuvenated with this simple procedure.

What is a chin and jaw augmentation? Chin and jaw augmentation (genioplasty/mentoplasty) can alter the underlying structure of the face to enhance facial profile and shape, providing more balance to the features. The procedure may involve reduction or addition of material to the chin in the form of chin rounding by osteotomy, or chin augmentation using surgical implants. Chin augmentation may strengthen appearance by successfully treating these conditions: - Overly prominent jaw or chin - A sunken or underdeveloped \"weak\" chin - An unbalanced, uneven facial profile The facial profile and general appearance of chin, jaw and neckline are all interconnected. There is no one corrective solution for everybody. Careful three-dimensional analysis of the soft tissue and underlying bone structure of the midface, lower jaw and neck are important to choosing the correct procedure to improve the jaw and neckline. Other procedures that may be performed in combination with chin and jaw augmentation: - Restoration of a strong jaw line by replacing missing soft tissue volume in the fat compartments of the midface with filler agents like [Voluma](https://esteem.pennstatehealth.org/service/injectables-dermal-fillers//#juvederm-voluma)or via fat grafting - Nose surgery or rhinoplasty - Cheek implant and lip augmentation to help provide overall facial balance - Facial liposuction to remove fat from under the chin and neck [Charlene Lam, MD, MPH](http://hmc.pennstatehealth.org/display-provider/-/provider/1847/charlene-c-lam-md-mph), associate professor of dermatology, is a board-certified dermatologist with Penn State Health.

A brow lift, also known as a forehead lift, is a surgical procedure that improves the forehead and space above the eyebrows, reducing the sagging skin of the forehead, upper eyelids and eyebrows. A brow lift may successfully treat the following conditions: - Frown lines, the deep vertical creases that develop between the eyebrows or across the top of your nose - Drooping eyebrows that hood the upper eyelids - Deep horizontal lines across the forehead - Sagging, drooping, tired-looking eyes Other cosmetic procedures that may be performed along with a brow lift: - Upper and or lower eyelid surgery (blepharoplasty) - A face lift - Skin resurfacing techniques What is breast reduction surgery? Breast reduction, also known as reduction mammoplasty, removes excess breast fat, glandular tissue and skin to achieve breast size in proportion with the individual's body, as well as to alleviate the discomfort associated with overly large breasts. For individuals with large breasts, breast reduction can offer various benefits: - eases discomfort - achieves a proportionate breast size in context with the body - helps improve self-image and confidence - improves the ability to participate in physical activities Results of breast reduction surgery are long-lasting. Some women feel that, in addition to droopy breasts, they have lost breast volume over the years. This is quite common in women who have given birth and nursed children. Mastopexy augment, or a breast lift augmentation, tightens the breast skin, elevates the nipple to a better height and increases the size for better upper chest fullness. The recovery from this surgery is slightly lengthier than that from a breast lift. Aging causes loose skin and breast volume loss, both of which cause breasts to droop or sag. These changes are often intensified by childbirth and weight changes. New statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons show breast lifts have grown 70 percent since 2000, outpacing breast implants two-to-one. What is breast lift surgery? A breast lift, also known as mastopexy, raises the breasts by removing excess skin and tightening the surrounding tissue to reshape and support the new breast contour. Sometimes the areola becomes enlarged over time, and a breast lift can reduce this, as well. Breast lift surgery does not significantly change the size of breasts, nor does it round out the upper part of the breast. If you want your breasts to look fuller, breast lift and breast augmentation surgery should be considered instead. While some implants last a lifetime, others may have issues or complications over time as bodies change. Breast implant revision surgery involves removal and replacement of saline or silicone breast implants. It is often for individuals who are unhappy with the size or type of implants that had been used or to correct any complications from their primary breast augmentation. Even for those whose breast implant surgery was perfectly planned and beautifully executed, body changes can occur over time. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, more than 250,000 breast augmentation procedures were performed in 2016. Breast augmentation is a common plastic surgery procedure that involves placing implants behind the breasts to increase overall size. This is a common interest for many people, including those who are underdeveloped, those who have lost volume after childbirth or weight loss, and those who just desire more volume in their breasts. Though the majority of women have minor volume differences in their breasts, clients with significant differences may also request augmentation of one or both breasts. Breast augmentation can increase breast fullness, improve balance with hip contours, as well as enhance self-image and confidence. There are situations when it is appropriate to perform a breast lift, as well. A consultation with a member of the Esteem team will help each client determine the best path for each individual. Body and Breast Whether looking to achieve a renewed shape or accentuate your naturally beautiful self, the body and breast services of Esteem Penn State Health Cosmetic Associates provide various options for both breast and body procedures. Body Contouring Body contouring treatment options offer solutions for those hoping to tighten or reshape parts of the body that have lost elasticity or shape. For example, substantial amount of weight loss, either because of weight loss surgery or lifestyle changes, can cause the skin and tissue to lack elasticity to adapt to reduced body size. Plastic surgeons use body contouring techniques to remove excess skin and help to achieve the individual's desired shape and figure following significant weight loss. What is body contouring? Surgical body contouring removes excess sagging skin and fat while improving the shape of the underlying support tissue, resulting in better proportioned appearance with smoother contours. Body contouring procedures: Breast Treatments Breast sculpting is based on tailored procedures, including augmentation with breast implants, breast lift procedures and breast reduction techniques, which can be combined to provide a natural and pleasing cosmetic outcomes. Effects of weight change Large weight gain can enlarge the breasts significantly and cause the surrounding skin to stretch and thin. Subsequent weight loss typically causes breast volume loss, but leaves stretched thin skin, with overall breast droop. This situation commonly requires both augmentation and breast lift procedures to restore breast shape. Clients with mild and moderate weight changes may be able to achieve desired breast shape with breast implants alone. Weight loss after breast procedures and other procedures may alter the results achieved originally following surgery. At the first consultation, the Esteem team assesses each individual's needs and forms a tailored approach to achieve the desired goal.

What is blepharoplasty? Blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery), more commonly known as an eye lift, is a surgical procedure to improve the appearance of the eyelids. Surgery can be performed on the upper lids, lower lids or both. Whether desiring an improved appearance or experiencing functional problems, eyelid surgery can rejuvenate the area surrounding the eyes. Eyelid surgery may successfully treat these conditions: - Excess, loose or sagging skin that creates unsightly folds or disturbs the natural contour of the upper eyelid, sometimes impairing vision - Fatty deposits appearing as puffiness in the eyelids - Bagginess and drooping of lower eyelids, revealing white below the iris - Excess skin and fine wrinkles of the lower eyelid Fluctuations in weight, aging and heredity can all cause upper arms to droop and sag; a change in appearance that cannot be corrected through exercise. What is an arm lift? An arm lift, or brachioplasty, is a surgical procedure to address a few different issues: - reduces excess sagging skin that droops downward - tightens and smooths the underlying supportive tissue defining the shape of the upper arm - reduces localized pockets of fat in the upper arm region Arm lift surgery may be right for you if the underside of your upper arms are sagging or appear loose and full, due to excess skin and fat. Recovery Recovery from arm lift surgery may include bandages on the incisions themselves, as well as an elastic bandage or wrap around the arm to minimize swelling after surgery. Sometimes a small tube is placed temporarily under the skin to drain excess blood or fluid. Everyone's recovery is different. Clients should speak with their doctor regarding specifics.

A flat and well-toned abdomen is something many of us strive for through exercise and weight control, yet sometimes these methods fall short of achieving our goals. Even individuals of otherwise normal body weight and proportion can develop an abdomen that bulges or is loose and sagging for various reasons: - aging - heredity - pregnancy - prior surgery - significant weight fluctuations What is abdominal wall surgery or a tummy tuck? Abdominal wall surgery, also known as abdominoplasty or a \"tummy tuck,\" removes excess fat and skin and, in most cases, restores weakened or separated muscles creating a firm and smooth abdominal profile. What a tummy tuck does not do? Tummy tucks cannot correct stretch marks, except those that are located on the areas of excess skin to be removed. Although the results of a tummy tuck are technically permanent and positive, outcomes can be greatly diminished by significant weight fluctuations. For this reason, individuals who are planning substantial weight loss or women who may be considering future pregnancies are typically advised to postpone tummy tuck procedures. "}
