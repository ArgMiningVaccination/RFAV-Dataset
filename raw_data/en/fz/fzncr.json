And who doesn't like that? But don't go running (or limping) to your closest chiropractic office too fast. Aside from some benefits here and there, chiropractic is mostly hokum. If you're gonna voluntarily have someone rough you up in an intimate setting, it might as well involve some harnesses and whips. (Or so I've been told). The [history of chiropractic](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/chiropractic-a-brief-overview-part-i/) screams bovine scat. It was started in 1895 by D.D. Palmer, who was a magnetic healer once before. Palmer allegedly discovered chiropractic (literally meaning \"by hand\") when he \"cured\" a janitor of deafness by manipulating the spinal column in his neck. FYI deafness is not associated with the spine at all. Information from the ear does not travel via the spinal cord. But why let facts interfere with a grandiose claim? Contrary to the germ theory of disease, Palmer based this on the debunked ideas of [vitalism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/vitalism). Without any research, Palmer claimed that all disease-ALL DISEASE-is caused by subluxated (misaligned) bones. These subluxated bones disrupt the \"flow\" of a vital spiritual life force that he called \"innate intelligence,\" especially in the spinal cord. But does this mean chiropractic is 100% useless? Not quite. Evidence shows a few chiropractic practices may be helpful under certain circumstances. (Ernst, 2008; Strahinjevich & Simpson, 2018). Despite these limitations, there are more than [70,000 chiropractors](https://www.acatoday.org/News-Publications/Newsroom/Key-Facts) in the United States. These are not doctors. A chiropractor is often licensed, but they are not medical doctors. The field still has plenty of quacks who adhere to those original principles, but not all do this, nor are all charlatans. But if a chiropractor starts talking about vitalism, then run away (or hobble away, depending on your back). Homeopathy (from another post) As [I've written before](https://sgtscholar.wordpress.com/2020/03/25/2011s-contagion-a-warning-of-pseudoscience-paranoia-bad-journalism-and-charlatans/) (almost verbatim, actually), [homeopathy is bullshit](https://www.livescience.com/31977-homeopathy.html). Utter bullshit. Homeopathy was invented in the late 18th century Germany by Samuel Hahnemann. He claimed that \"like cures like\" in minute concentrations. Hahnemann's Homeopathy proposes that water retains the \"memory\" of an active ingredient, and the water can be used as the remedy. This is nonsense, but it gets wackier. This ingredient is then diluted to about 1 part \"ingredient\" to 1030 parts water (Loudon, 2006). At this concentration, you would need to drink approximately 8,000 gallons of water to get a single molecule of the active ingredient. If you applied this to trying to get pregnant, you would need 8,000 gallons of diluted semen to get one sperm. This pseudoscientific dribble flies right in the face of physical laws. If this is how chemistry operated, I would never have to buy another beer. I would just keep watering down the same one for the rest of my life. Not to mention, water has been on Earth for billions of years. Conceivably, every water molecule has the \"memory\" of a slew of substances, which potentially includes naturally occurring arsenic to T-Rex love juice. Yum. But now that we had our laugh, let's get serious for a moment. [tragic case](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/belief-in-homeopathy-results-in-the-death-of-a-7-year-old-italian-child/), an Italian seven-year-old boy died from an ear infection because his parents refused to give him antibiotics. They insisted on giving him a homeopathic medicine. Beliefs have consequences. Carpe Datum and Semper Sci, Sgt Scholar, out. Please help us by liking, commenting, sharing, and following!
