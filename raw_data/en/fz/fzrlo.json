Variations - Make it gluten free: Use gluten-free bread. - [Quinoa, craisin, parsley and pine nut stuffing](https://www.healthyfood.com/healthy-recipes/quinoa-craisin-parsley-and-pine-nut-stuffing/) HFG tip - We used a turkey with no added salt. - The stuffing must be completely cooled before stuffing turkey to prevent bacteria growing. Don't stuff the turkey too tightly, as the meat won't cook evenly and the stuffing expands when cooked. If using a frozen turkey, place on a tray and defrost in the fridge. A 4-5kg turkey takes about 70 hours (3 days) to defrost. - Check the ingredients list on your frozen turkey as many are basted in salty brine to tenderise, possibly with added flavour and thickener, which makes the turkey high in sodium.
