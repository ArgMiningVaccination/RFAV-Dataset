Introduction The shipping and receiving of biological materials is regulated by several government agencies. According to federal regulations: \"It is the responsibility of the shipper to ensure correct identification, classification, packaging, labeling, marking, and documentation for all shipments of infectious substances. In addition, the shipper must make advance arran gements with the recipient (consignee) and operator (carrier), including acquisition of any permits for the importation of infectious substances from foreign countries. Failure to comply with federal and international regulations can result in refusal of t he shipment by the airline, penalties of fines, jail, or both. Hand carriage of infectious substances by air is strictly prohibited by law.\" Applicable Transportation Regulations FedEx - General guidelines for packaging, marking and labeling clinical samp les and biological substance, Category B, http://www.fedex.com/us/services/packageshipment/index.html?CMP=PAC -GTS - VURL008 (see Pack like a Pro in menu bar) DOT regulates the shipment of Etiological Agents, http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2008/01/23/E8 -1050/interstate -shipment -of- etiologic -agents IATA - Dangerous Goods Regulations (DEHS has copies of the regulations) WHO - Guidelines for the Safe Transport of Infectious Substances and Diagnostic Specimens, 1997 Postal Service Hazardous Materials Domestic Mail Regulation, http://www.ups.com/content/us/en/resources/ship/hazardous/index.html Before requesting biological material to be shipped to you: Obtain any required permits, see Sections III & VI, and send copies to the shipper. If shipment is from a foreign country be sure they are aware of U.S. shipping regulations and that they have the correct labels, send labels to the foreign shipper if needed. Be sure you have current Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC at http://gero.n ku.edu/research/rgc/irb/ibc.html ) approval to work with the material if it requires Biosafety Level 2 or higher precautions or is a biologically derived toxin. Arrange to have someone present to receive the material when it arrives. Get approval from acade mic department and dean to receive materials. After receiving biological material: Notify the Biosafety Officer to have Biosafety Level 2 or higher organisms and biologically derived toxins added to the university's biological material inventory. 2 Before s hipping biological material: Request a copy of Biological Safety Officer approval for pathogen possession/use from the receiver's institution; send a copy of the approval to Safety and Emergency Management . Determine if a Material Transfer Agreement is required. See Section III D . Determine the material's classification; see Section IV and the Classification Flow Chart. (Appendix 1) If the material is classified as a Category A or B Infectious Substance, or shipped on dry ice, or a toxin you must contact the Department of Bio logical Science Lab Manager who will supervise and sign off on all shipments. In the event the Lab Manger is not available, contact the Safety and Emergency Management Director. Obtain the correct type of packaging and labels for the material classificat ion. If the receiver needs a permit, request a copy from them before shipping. If shipment is going to another country, see Section VI and include a customs courtesy letter . Arrange for the receiver to be available to take possession of the package when it arrives. The information provided in these guidelines is an overview and not meant to be comprehensive. It may be necessary to contact applicable government agencies for clarification and updates regarding permit requirements. II. Training Requirements If you regularly ship Category A or B Infecti ous Substances ( see Appendix 1 Infectious Substance Classification Flow Chart) or on dry ice or toxins as described in Section IV , you must receive initial and update training to fulfill the requirements of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the shipping companies. Shipping training must be updated every two years or more frequently if regulations change . These guidelines are meant to supplement the above training and are not a substitute for the hazardous material shipping class. Shipping biological materials listed as excluded from dangerous goods regulations in S ection IV does not require training. III. Permits to Receive Biological Materials Federal permits are required to import/export disease- causing agents for humans and animals, vectors for those agents, animal products, plants, plant products, and plant pe sts. Permits may also be required for domestic transport of some agents. The recipient of the material must obtain any required permits. If you are the shipper, request a copy of any applicable permits from the recipient. The U.S. receiver (importer) is responsible for the package being sent to them from a foreign country. The receiver must assure that the foreign shipper has packed and labeled the material according to U.S. Public Health Service and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) regul ations. The importer must send the proper shipping labels and a copy of their import permit to 3 the shipper. Complying with foreign import regulations should prevent packages from being held at customs or denied entry. See Section VI for additional information. Inquire to the proper government agency listed below for permit requirements and applications well before the material is needed as it may take several weeks to process a permit application. A. USDA/APHIS Transport Permits The USDA/APHIS (Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) regulates transport of materials that could potentially harm U.S. agricultural products including livestock, poultry and crops. APHIS permits may be required for import, export, and interstate transport of animal or plant pathogens, pathogen vectors, animals, animal products, plants, plant products, and the introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment. 1. Transportation of Infectious Substances See Appendix 2 2. USDA Import Guidelines For Products That Do Not Require An Import Permit See Appendix 3 1110 Microbially Produced Materials: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/animals/animal_import/downloads/imicro.html 1114 http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/animals/animal_import/downloads/irecom.html 3. Animal Related USDA/ APHIS permits are required for imports/ exports and inter -state transport of: animal or plant pathogens including challenge material from the USDA specimens reasonably believed to contain animal or plant pathogens* vectors of animal or plant disease* potentially hazardous animal or plant products *USDA/APHIS regulation 9 CFR Animals and Animal Products Parts 94, 95, and 122 covers transport of organisms or vectors that can cause infectious diseases of animals. The regulation defines material requiring a permit as, \"(d) Organisms. All cultures or collections of organisms or their deri vatives, which may introduce or disseminate any contagious or infectious disease of animals (including poultry). (e) Vectors. All animals (including poultry) such as mice, pigeons, guinea pigs, rats, ferrets, rabbits, chickens, dogs, and the like, which ha ve been treated or inoculated with organisms, or which are diseased or infected with any contagious, infectious, or communicable disease of animals or poultry or which have bee n exposed to any such disease. http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_03/9cfrv1_03.html . An Import/Transport permit: 4 must be obtained by the intended receiver of the material before shipment is made is good for one year and is amendable/renew able application (VS Form 16 -3) can be downloaded at: http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/animals/downloads/vs16_3.pdf form is for either foreign import or interstate transfer requires 6 to 8 weeks for processing To determine if the material you wish to transport requires a permit, visit the APHIS: National Center for Import and Export (NCIE) Website at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/index.shtml NOTE: According to the USDA, \"Generally, a USDA veterinary permit (VS -16-6) is needed for materials derived from animals or exposed to animal- source materials. Materials which require a permit include, animal tissues, blood, cells or cell lines of livestock or poultry origin, RNA/DNA extracts, hormones, enzymes, monoclonal antibodies for IN VIVO use in non- human species, certain polyclonal antib odies, antisera, bulk shipments of test kit reagents, and microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi. Exceptions to this requirement are human and non-human primate tissues, serum, and blood. \" 4. Plant Related USDA/APHIS regulation 7 CFR Part 330 Federal Plant Pest Regulations covers the transport of plant pests ( http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text /text- idx?sid=d3893c775af403b08c654c1f15a669be&c=ecfr&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title07/7tab_02.tpl ). For information on plant pest transport permits see http://www.aphis.usda.gov/permits/ppq_eperm its.shtml . For information on plant and plant product transport permits see http://www.aphis.usda.gov/permits/ppq_epermits.shtml . The intended receiver of plants and plant pests must obt ain a permit for transport before shipment is made. Allow 6 to 8 weeks for processing. Examples of some permit applications are: PPQ 526 Application for Permit to Move Live Plant Pests or Noxious Weeds PPQ 586 Application for Permit to Transit Plants and/ or Plant Products Into or Through the United States PPQ 587(MD) Application for Permit to Import Plants or Plant Products PPQ 588 Application for Permit to Import Plants or Plant Products for Experimental Purposes Phytosanitary certificate: document requ ired by many states and foreign countries see http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/plants/plant_exports/pcit.shtml for description Contact APHIS for clarification of which permit is required, instructions on how to obtain permit applications, and to determine if any changes have been made to the initial regulation. APHIS National Center for Import/Export Products (301 734- 3277) http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/about/welcome.html 5 5. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) To determine if a permit is needed to import or transport a GMO, contact the APHIS Biotechnology permit branch via a letter of notification . B. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) The Department of Health and Human Services, through the CDC, regulates the transport of biological materials that could cause illness in humans, including pathogens and biological toxins. Human infectious substances . In general, a permit is needed for any infectious agent known or suspected to cause disease in humans that you wish to import into the United States. In some cases subsequent distribution of an agent (i.e., SARS -CoV, select agents, viruses requiring BSL -4 containment) is prohibited within the United States and requires CDC authorization/permit prior to transfer to another location within the U.S. These permits may be obtained from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, Office of Health and Safety, Etiologic Agent Import Permit Program at http://www.cdc.gov/od/eaipp/ or telephone (404) 498- 1600 for further information. Foreign imports of the following materials require a Permit to Imp ort or Transport Agents or Vectors of Human Disease: any etiologic agent any arthropod or other animal host or vector of human disease any exotic living arthropod or other animal capable of being a host or vector of human disease Non-human primate materia l - all non- human primate material (e.g., blood, plasma, tissue, urine, feces) requires an import permit, unless it has been specifically treated and rendered non-infectious. Domestic transport may or may not require a permit. To determine if your shipment requires a permit: call 404 -498-2260 visit the CDC Web site at http://www.cdc.gov/od/eaipp/ Go to the online form to submit a permit application http://www.cdc.gov/od/eaipp/faq.htm Some microorganisms and cell lines purchased from ATCC require permits to be shipped domestically. For ATCC permit info see http://www.atcc.org/Order/permits.cfm. C. Phytosanitary Certificate A phytosanitary certificate is a document often required by many states and foreign countries for the import of nonprocessed, plant products, http://www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/plants/plant_exports/pcit.shtml 6 D. Material Transfer Agreement Steps to ship a Select Agent: Contact the Department of Biological Sciences Lab Manager to coordinate shipment and CDC/USDA approval with the receiving entity. After CDC/USDA approval has been received to ship the material, the material will remain in the Biological Sciences Department for pick -up. Immediately update your inventory including the date sent and signature of the authorized individual who removed the material from storage. Send a copy to EHS Department. Notify EHS Department any time a request is received for a Select Agent even if you do not agree to ship the material. Steps to receive a Select Agent: Call the Biosafety Officer to verify that the University's Certificate of Registration includes your lab and the desired Select Agent material. You will need to have an active NKU Biohazardous Agent Registration (BAR) before using the material. If there are no permits required from Homeland Security or CDC, then your package can be shipped. The location and approximate amounts of Biosafety Level 2 pathogens and select agents will be tracked by the Biosafety Officer and the Director of EHS. After the shipping entity receives CDC/USDA approval for th e transfer, the Department of Biological Sciences Lab Manager will arrange for shipment. The shipment will be delivered to your department. Open the package in a biological safety cabinet, to examine the contents for damage. Update your inventory immedia tely including the date received, source of material, and any identifying characteristics. Sign the amended inventory log and send a copy to EHS Department. The Office of Research, Grants and Contracts handles all incoming Material Transfer Agreements. Contact Mary Ucci for details. IV. Classification of Hazardous Material Biological materials that fall under the Dangerous Goods Regulations for shipping by air are classified in one of four different groups: Category A Infectio us substances: Hazard Class 6.2, which are BSL -3 and BSL -4 Category B Infectious Substance (previously called Diagnostic/Clinical specimens): Hazard Class 6.2 Toxins: Hazard Class 6.1 Some genetically modified organisms (GMOs) including microorganisms: Hazard Class 9 UN3245 7 These classifications are used to select the proper shipping procedures, see Section V . Shipping Category A & B Infectious Agents, Toxins, and some GMOs require attending a trai ning session, see Section II . See Appendix 1 Infectious Substance Classification Flow chart to help determine if a material falls under Category A or B Infectious Substances. NOTE: If the material is also classified as a Select Agent, additional regulations apply, see Section E below. The following materials are not cla ssified as dangerous goods and are not subject to IATA regulations: Biological products which are manufactured and packaged in accordance with the requirements of appropriate national authorities and transported for the purposes of final packaging or distr ibution, and use for personal health care by medical professionals or individuals. Biological products which are certified by the USDA, FDA, or other national authority for use in the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of disease in humans or animals, or for development, experimental or investigational purposes related thereto. NOTE: If the product contains an infectious substance it must be shipped as Category A or B Infectious Substance. Substances which do not contain infectious substances or substances that are unlikely to cause disease in humans or animals. Substances containing microorganisms which are non- pathogenic to humans or animals. Patient specimens for which there is minimal likelihood that pathogens are present. Note: Patient specimens ar e material collected directly from humans or animals, including, but not limited to, excreta, secreta, blood and its components, tissue and tissue fluid swabs, and body parts being transported for purpose such as research, diagnosis, investigational activi ties, disease treatment and prevention. Note: In determining whether a patient specimen has a minimal likelihood that pathogens are present, an element of professional judgement is required to determine if a substance is exempt. That judgement should be based on the known medical history, symptoms and individual circumstances of the source, human or animal, and endemic local conditions. If there is any reason to suspect that the specimen contains a pathogen, it cannot be shipped as exempt from Class 6.2 Ha zardous Material. Substances in a form that any present pathogens have been neutralized or inactivated such that they no longer pose a health risk. Environmental samples (including food and water samples) which are not considered to pose a significant ris k of infection. Dried blood spots, collected by applying a drop of blood onto absorbent material, or faecal occult blood screening tests. Material collected for transfusion or transplantation. 8 All human blood, human blood products and human cells must ha ve a biohazard label (OSHA) on the sample on the primary containment but not on the outside of an \"exempt human specimen\". Exempt substances do not require a Declaration of Dangerous Goods or hazardous material training. However, if the substance is shipped on dry ice the dangerous goods regulation for dry ice must be followed and training is still required. USDA/APHIS permits may still be required even if IATA transportation regulations do not apply. A. Category A Infectious Substances Infectious substances are materials that are known or are reasonably expected to contain pathogens. Pathogens are defined as microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, rickettsiae, parasites, fungi) and other agents, such as prions, which can cause disease in humans or animals. Category A Infectious Su bstances are agents which are transported in a form that, when exposure to it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability or life threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals. All material meeting these criteria must be shippe d as Category A. See Appendix 6 for examples of Category A agents. Note: Some of the materials on this list only need to be shipped as Category A if it is cultured. Cultures do not include patient samples. Patient samples are collected directly from the p atient and are not propagated for diagnosis. When in doubt, ship as Category A B. Biological Substances Category B (Previously Called Diagnostic/Clinical Specimens): Category B Infectious Substances are biological materials that: do not meet criteria for i nclusion in Category A are not exempt patient samples and are not included in the exemptions listed above Category B substances are shipped under the proper shipping name: Biological Substance, Category B. Any material listed in Appendix 6 cannot be shi pped as Category B. This is a list of examples only and is not meant to include all materials forbidden as Category B. When in doubt, ship as Category A. C. Non -infectious Exempt Patient Specimens IATA (air transport) regulations allow for some patient spe cimens to be shipped as exempt from Dangerous Goods requirements. These regulations are adhered to by FedEx and can also be used for DHL/Airborne shipments. Exempt patient specimens are those for which there is minimal likelihood that pathogens are present , but that does not mean these are not regulated. 9 Note: Patient specimens are material collected directly from humans or animals, including, but not limited to, excreta, secreta, blood and its components, tissue and tissue fluid swabs, and body parts being transported for purpose such as research, diagnosis, investigational activities, disease treatment and prevention. Note: In determining whether a patient specimen has a minimal likelihood that pathogens are present, an element of professional judgement i s required to determine if a substance is exempt. That judgement should be based on the known medical history, symptoms and individual circumstances of the source, human or animal, and endemic local conditions. If there is any reason to suspect that the specimen contains a pathogen, it cannot be shipped as exempt from Class 6.2 Hazardous Material. Exempt substances do not require a Declaration of Dangerous Goods or hazardous material training. However, if the substance is shipped on dry ice the dangerous goods regulation for dry ice must be followed and training is still required. Exempt pat ient specimens must be properly packaged. D. Toxins Toxins are material obtained from a plant, animal, fungal, or bacterial source that are toxic to humans or animals. Shipping of toxins falls under Hazardous Material regulations. If the toxin is contained in an infectious substance or if the toxin contains an infectious substance, it must be classified as an Infectious Substance, not a toxin. Packing Group (PG I, II, or I II) criteria for toxins is based on severity of risk according to its LD 50. Shipping training is required. Toxins are Class 6.1. E. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) Genetically modified microorganisms (GMMOs) and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are microorganisms and organisms in which genetic material has been purposely altered through genetic engineering in a way that does not occur naturally. Classifying GMOs for shipping: If a GMO meets the definition of a Category A or B Infectious Substance it must be classified as such. GMO/ GMMOs, which do not meet the definition of infectious substances, must be assigned to class 9 UN3245 if shipped by air. Individual countries have strict regulations r egarding GMOs. Be sure to become informed of the receiving country's regulations. F. Select Agents The federal government regulates the use, handling, and transport of certain biological materials considered to be potential bioterrorism agents. 10 Select Ag ents are classified as either Infectious Substances or Toxins. Follow IATA packing and labeling instructions according to its classification. Transport of Select Agents is subject to the following additional regulations; The Department of Health and Human Services' Regulation 42 Part 73, Possession, Use, and Transfer of Select Agents and Toxins; Final Rule, http://www.cdc.gov/od/sap/pdfs/42_cfr_73_final_rule.pdf , the USDA's Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act, and university policy. Notify the university's Biosafety Officer if you wish to ship, receive, or transfer any quantity of Select Agents. This includes on campus transfers. All infectious Select Agents and Select Agent toxins, in quantities above CDC exemption quantities, require DEHS and CDC or USDA approval prior to shipping . The Biosafety Officer is responsible for tracking all transfers of Select Agents both on and off campus, documenting and reporting transfers to CDC or the USDA, verif ying that transfers are only made between registered facilities, maintaining an accurate Select Agent inventory, and notifying CDC or USDA of suspicious activity or requests regarding the transfer of Select Agents. Federally Regulated Quantities of Select Agents CDC or USDA must approve all shipments of Select Agents between entities. Both the receiving and the shipping entity must have a current Select Agent Certificate of Registration. The receiving entity is responsible for initiating the approval proce ss. All documentation should be forwarded to Safety and Emergency Management. Steps to ship a Select Agent: Contact the Department of Biological Sciences Lab Manager to coordinate shipment and CDC/USDA approval with the receiving entity. After CDC/USDA approval has been received to ship the material, the material will remain in the shipping department for pick- up. Immediately update your inventory including the date sent and signature of the authorized individual who removed the material from storage. Send a copy to Safety and Emergency Management . Notify Safety and Emergency Management any time a request is received for a Select Agent even if you do not agree to ship the material. Steps to receive a Select Agent: Call the Biosafety Officer to verify that the university's Certificate of registration includes your lab and the desired Select Agent material. If it does not, you will need to fill out a Biohazardous Registration Form that will be reviewed by NLU's Biosaf ety Officer. If approved, and if there are no permits required from Homeland Security or CDC, then your package can be shipped. Level 2 pathogens and select agents will be tracked by the Biosafety Officer and the Director of Safety and emergency Management . After the shipping entity receives CDC/USDA approval for the transfer, the Department of Biological Sciences Lab Manager will arrange for shipment. The shipment will be delivered to your department. 11 Open the package in a biological safety cabinet, to e xamine the contents for damage. Update your inventory immediately including the date received, source of material, and any identifying characteristics. Sign the amended inventory log and send a copy to Safety and Emergency Management . Federally Exempt Qu antities of Select Agent Toxins Contact Safety and Emergency Management prior to shipping or receiving any quantity of Select Agent Toxins. Exempt quantities of Select Agent toxins do not require submission of Report of Transfer Form EA101 to CDC/USDA but are still tracked by the Biosafety Officer in order to keep the university's biological material inventory up -to-date. Report to Safety and Emergency Management how much toxin is shipped, when it was shipped, and to whom it was shipped. On Campus Transf er of Select Agents Follow all transfer of biological material guidelines in Section VIII . In addition: transfers can only be made between laboratories that are registered for that particular Select Agent only authorized individuals can make transfers between labs the receiving lab must have an authorized individual present to accept the material Document the transfer by submitting a Record of Transfer of Select Agent to the Biosafety Officer, copy Safety and Emergency Management . Both transferring and receiving labs must immediately update their inventory including the date of transfer and a signature of the authorized individual making the transfer. V. Packing Instructions The following information is an overview, not comprehensive instructions. Hazard Class designations and packing groups are used to determine the packing instructions that must be followed for shipping. See Appendix 4 for a summary of shipment types, proper shipping names, UN numbers, hazard class, and packing instruction numbers . FedEx's Web site gives instructions on filling out their U.S. Airbill required for all shipments. Packages displaying UN markings referred to in the following packing instructions meet the United Nations (UN) packaging specifications and performance testing. A. Category A Infectious Substances: Packing Instruction 620 Infectious substances require a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods. FedEx's Web site , provides helpful information on filling out the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods. 12 General Requirements The Consignee section of the Shipper's Decl aration for Dangerous Goods must include a name and phone number for the person responsible for the shipment. Proper shipping names must be indicated on the outside of the package; for UN 2814 - Infectious Substance Affecting Humans and for UN 2900 - Infec tious Substance Affecting Animals. Technical names may be omitted from the proper shipping name on the outside of the package. If the technical name of the pathogen is not known, you may omit the technical name on the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous G oods and place \"Suspected Category A infectious Substance\" in parenthesis following the proper shipping name. The Additional Handling Information box on the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods must include \"Emergency Telephone Number 1- 800-424-9300\" . (ChemTrec) A SDS sheet must be on file with ChemTrec prior to shipping Enclose an itemized list of contents between the secondary packaging and the outer packaging. If an overpack is used for dry ice, infectious substance markings need to go on the outer box along with the statement \"Inner packages comply with prescribed specifications\". Inner Packaging Requirements Primary receptacles must be watertight. Secondary packaging must be watertight. An itemized list of the contents enclosed between the se condary packaging and the outer packaging Absorbent material must be placed between the primary receptacle(s) and secondary packaging and be of sufficient quantity to absorb the entire contents of the primary receptacle(s). Outer Packaging Requirements Must be rigid Package must be at least four inches in the smallest overall external dimension. Package must be properly labeled. Package must pass required testing and be marked with UN marking for CLASS 6.2 B. Category B Infectious Substances (Previous ly Called Diagnostic/Clinical Specimens): Packing Instruction 650 Shipments of Category B Infectious Substances do not require a Dangerous Goods Declaration. Packaging must be of good quality, strong enough to withstand normal transport conditions including manual or mechanical handling, vibration, changes in temperature, humidity, or pressure. Packaging must have a: a leak -proof primary receptacle not containing more than 1 liter or 4 kg 13 a leak -proof secondary package a rigid outer package not containi ng more than 4 liters or 4 kg Outer package must have a diamond -shaped label with UN3373 in letters at least 6mm high and the proper shipping name \"BIOLOGICAL SUBSTANCE, CATEGORY B\" adjacent to the diamond- shaped label. Outer package must have one side wi th a minimum of 100mm X100mm. Include name, address, and telephone number of responsible party either on the air waybill or on the package. Package may include 30ml or less of substances in Classes 3, 8, or 9 if required to maintain the viability of the sample, preserve the sample, or reduce the hazard of the sample. Remember, these packing instructions are for air shipments only. The complet ed package must be capable of passing a drop test of at least 1.2 meters. An itemized list of contents must be enclosed between the secondary packaging and the outer packaging. C. Non -infectious Exempt Patient Specimens Use a leak -proof primary receptacl e. When multiple fragile primary receptacles are placed in a single secondary package they must be either individually wrapped or otherwise separated to prevent contact between them. For liquid specimens, place sufficient absorbent material between the primary and secondary package to be able to absorb the entire volume. Use a leak -proof secondary receptacle. Use an outer package of adequate strength for its capacity, mass and intended use. The outer package must have at least one surface with minimum dimensions of 100mm x 100mm. If the outer package is smaller, place it in a shipping envelope. Mark the outer package \"Exempt Human Specimen\" or \"Exempt Animal Specimen\". For the FedEx Airbill question \"Does shipment contain dangerous goods?\" check no. D. Toxins: Packing Instructions Vary Biologically derived toxins that contain infectious substances or toxins that are contained in an infectious substance must be shipped as a Risk Class 6.2 Infectious Substances. All other biologically derived toxins fal l under Risk Class 6.1. Risk Class designations and packing groups are used to determine the packing instructions that must be followed for shipping. Packing Group criteria for toxins is based on severity of risk according to LD 50. Very small amounts of toxins in Risk Class 6.1 may be shipped as \"Dangerous Goods in Excepted Quantities.\" \"Excepted Quantities\" are accepted from the marking, labeling, and documentation requirements for shipping Dangerous Goods. No toxic label or Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods are needed. On the FedEx waybill, check the box marked \"Yes, does not require declaration of dangerous goods.\" If shipped by ground, the outer packaging must have the marking: \"This package conforms to 49 CFR 173.4.\" If shipped by air, package must have a special handling label for \"Excepted Quantities\" indicating the hazard class and UN number. 14 Any quantity of inhalation toxins in Packing Group I may not follow \"Excepted Quantities\" procedures. All \"Dangerous Goods in Excepted Quantities\" mus t be considered material that is permitted for shipping on passenger aircraft. \"Dangerous Goods in Excepted Quantities\" cannot be transported in either checked or carry -on baggage or shipped via mail. If shipping a quantity above the dangerous goods \"Exce pted Quantities\", a shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods is required, toxic labels need to be attached, and package must be marked as meeting with UN performance requirements. E. Genetically Modified Organisms: Packing Instruction 959 IATA regulated GMOs fall under Hazard Class 9, UN3245 and must follow Packing Instruction 959. Hazardous Material shipping training is required. Pack same as infectious materials (Packing Instruction 620) but package does not require testing. The maximum quantity in a primary receptacle must not exceed 100ml or 100g. F. Dry Ice: Packing Instruction 954 box must be able to release gas build- up indicate the dry ice weight in kg on both the waybill and on the box include the marking \"Dry Ice, UN1845\" on the box place a Class 9 label on the box G. Liquid Nitrogen Properly handled liquid nitrogen \"dry shippers\" can be transported without any additional regulations. Be sure t hat all the liquid nitrogen has been removed from the shipper before transport. Failure to do so can result in substantial fines.

Transporting Infectious Substances Safely FedEx - General guidelines for packaging, marking and labeling clinical samples and biological substance, Category B, http://www.fedex.com/us/services/packageshipment/index.html?CMP=PAC -GTS -VURL008 (see Pack like a Pro in menu bar) VI. International Shipment Regulations and Permits 15 The following agencies may require a permit for international shipments . Expect to need more preparation time to send or receive foreign shipments in order to process the required paperwork. The U.S. receiver (importer) is responsible for the package being sent to them from a foreign country. The receiver must assure that th e foreign shipper has packed and labeled the material according to U.S. Public Health Service and IATA regulations. The importer must send the proper shipping labels and a copy of the import permit to the shipper. Taking care to comply with foreign import regulations should prevent packages from being held at customs or denied entry. As an extra precaution, you may wish to find out what carrier the shipper will use and what day and at what port your package is expected to arrive. Contact the U.S. Customs O ffice at that port and inform them that a package will be arriving for you and what the contents will be. Ask them to contact you immediately if there are any questions A. USDA/APHIS Section III covered USDA and CDC permits required to ship/receive biological material both within the U.S. and from a foreign country. Be aware that Genetically Modified (Engineered) Organisms that are not controlled, or subject to regulations, may be hel d by customs because of the similarity of the organism to other organisms that are regulated. To prevent an international shipment from being stopped at the port of entry: include a courtesy form letter in the shipment, see Appendix 5 as another option, application may be made for a Courtesy Permit (APHIS Form 2000) http://www.aphis.usda.gov/brs/pdf/2000.pdf . Indicate on the form that the data is being submitted as a request for a courtesy permit. Include a statement explaining why you believe the organism or product does not come within the definition of a regulated article. The application must be submitted at least 60 days prior to the time the courtesy permit is s ought. B. Department of Commerce Exports of designated biological agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a threat to human, animal or plant life may require a license from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) . The scope of items subject to this licensing requirement is broader than \"select agents,\" and researchers must consult with the Director of Safety and Emergency management to conduct a separate review to determine if a BIS export license is required. BIS may require a license for the export of: Designated human, animal and plant pathogens, zoonoses and toxins Genetically modified microorganisms or genetic elements that contain nucleic acid sequences associated with the pathogenicity of a controlled organism or that code for a controlled toxin Genetic material and products which might be used for culture of large amounts of agents 16 These regulations are chemical and biological weapon controls and generally require licenses for all locations other than Canada. (Canada requires the recipient to have an import permit, see E. below.) Obtaining a license is a long process, and a license may be denied at the discretion of BIS. Researchers should contact the Export Controls Officer as early as possible, should build in three (3) months' lead -time to initiate foreign shipments of material requiring a license, and should not commit to delivery prior to issuance of a license. C. U.S. Fish and Wildlife A permit may be required by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife to export/import non- agricultural biological samples, including artificially propagated plants and endangered species. Call 1- 800-770-0150 or go to http://www.fws.gov/permits/ to determine if your shipment n eeds a permit. D. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) The FDA controls most food and other products that enter the U.S. Foods (except for certain meats and poultry products), drugs (human, animal and biological), cosmetics, medical devices and radiation e mitting devices, etc., offered for entry into the United States require a permit or registration. Go to http://www.fda.gov/ora/import/ to determine if your request for shipment of one of these products from another country is regulated. E. Canadian Import Regulations Shipments of human, animal, or plant pathogens to Canada will require a Canadian import permit. You will need to allow sufficient lead -time for the Canadian recipient to obtain the proper permits. Packaging of shipments will need to comply with the Canadian Transport of Dangerous Goods Regulations. See the Transport Canada Web site for details, http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/tdg/clear -tofc- 211.htm . VII. Receipt of Leaking, Damaged, or Suspicious Packages A. Leaking or Damaged Package Departments/laboratories that regularly receive shipments of biological materials should have a written procedure for the receipt of leaking or damaged packages. If you receive a biological material package that is leaking or has br oken containers inside, call Safety and Emergency Management. consult on clean- up procedures determine if any outside agencies need to be notified advise on disposal of the box and its contents If any material is spilled on a person, remove contaminated clothing and shoes, flush the skin for 15 minutes, and seek medical assistance immediately. 17 While waiting for help to arrive: do not touch or walk through spill area isolate the spill or leak area keep unauthorized personnel away obtain identity of the substance(s) involved B. Suspicious Package See the CDC Web site http://www.bt.cdc.gov/DocumentsApp/HAN50.pdf for guidelines on handling suspicious packages or envelopes. VIII. Transporting Infectious Substances by Ground When these materials are transported, Department of Transportation (DOT) Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) may apply and are extremely complex in nature. Laboratory personnel must properly package, transport, and handle any Infecti ous substances that are used in their research. Labeling using the universal biohazard symbol is also required for any infectious biological materials in order to prevent accidental exposure to unsuspecting personnel who may be exposed to the biological ma terial (e.g., couriers, administrative staff, and janitors). A. Packaging and Training Requirements The following packaging requirements apply to all ground transport of infectious substances prepared for transport either on- grounds or off -grounds irrespec tive of the mode of transportation. Category A: It is permissible to hand- carry between buildings. IATA/DOT Packing Instruction PI 620 must be followed. If the distance is too great for carrying by hand, materials must be shipped by air with a commercial c arrier (e.g. FedEx, DHL). Cat.A material must NEVER be transported by ground in a motor vehicle. Category B: must follow the IATA/DOT Packaging Instruction, PI 650. Exempt Patient/Animal Specimens 2: Triple -packaged (i.e., as in Category B with leak proof primary and secondary containers ). Absorbent material for liquids, and a rigid outer container. If materials are human in origin, a biohazard symbol must be placed on either the secondary container or the outer container to meet OSHA compliance (29 CFR 1910.1030). Dry Ice: Package must be labeled \"Dry Ice\" on two sides. No Training requirements for Ground. B. Means of Transport The following are means by which Infectious Substances may be legally transported within and around the University. The DOT Hazardous Material Regulations (49 CFR Parts 171- 180) regulates 18 the movement of Division 6.2 Infectious Substances and are regulated when carriage is considered to be \"in commerce\". Transport in Personal or University Vehicle Under NO circumstances may public transportation be used for transport of Hazardous Materials. In general, movement or ground transport of regulated materials is covered by the DOT's Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) only when they are considered to be \"in commerce.\" If a Division 6.2 infectious substances is transported in a personal or university (i.e., government) vehicle for use in university activities (projects, research, etc.) it is generally not considered to be \"in commerce.\" However, these personnel must 1. have a valid driver's l icense, 2. be authorized to use a University vehicle, 3. use the proper containment and packaging materials in -route and 4. Be trained and authorized to handle and transport hazardous materials within University property. 5. Should use a University vehicle when avail able. *Note : If using a personal vehicle to transport the individual should consult with his/her personal insurance policy regarding liability and coverage in this instance. Transport by contracted carrier Commercial or Private carriers (i.e., commercial t ransport companies) are subject to the HMR. These include companies such as FedEx, DHL as well as medical couriers etc. Transport of infectious substances to other institutions or entities such as another university, a waste disposal facility, or a return to the manufacturer should only be done by DOT licensed hazardous materials carriers to another location via a public thoroughfare. When Principal Investigators leave an institution, the research may be transferred to the new institution, which then become s the owner; however, the original institution is legally responsible for the shipment to the new institution. Contact the Biological Science Lab Manager for consultation. Category A and Category B Infectious Substance should be consigned by air (exempt human specimens are exempt but regulated). Assurance from the carrier must be given that DOT regulations are being met. As of October 1, 2006 the DOT regulations state that Materials of Trade (MOTS) see 49 CFR \u00a7173.6 exceptions only apply to patient specime ns or those samples that would be otherwise considered Category B that are contained in a human (patient) or animal sample (no cultures). Therefore personal or dedicated vehicle transport in addition to carrier transport can only use a MOTS exception for P atient Specimens. Transport (hand- carry) between University labs or buildings through public areas 19 Infectious substances must be transported or moved between laboratories in way as to prevent spills and accidental exposure or release. Include the following: Provide your contact information: name, address, and phone on the outside of the package Place material in a primary (specimen) container that is leak -proof and secured with a tight - fitting cap, parafilm, or lab tape. Place sufficient absorbent material (diapers, absorbent towels, pads) around the primary containers to contain all the liquid if a breakage occurs. Place the primary containers in a secondary transport container that is also sealed and labeled with a biohazard symbol. Rigid outer pa ckage of good quality strong enough to withstand normal transport conditions.3 If transporting on dry ice label the package \"Dry Ice\" on two sides. Materials packed in this way may be moved on a cart or other device between rooms or buildings. Lab coats an d gloves are not appropriate attire for moving between buildings or transporting material in tunnels. Wear PPE that is appropriate for movement through public areas (e.g. lab coat and/or single -glove technique where appropriate -- it is not advisable to we ar gloves when using public elevators, however, a single -glove technique may be employed when moving through laboratory floors). Leave the material with a known responsible individual in the receiving lab. Do not leave the material unattended or with an un known individual.

A pathogen is a microorganism (including bacteria, viruses, rickettsiae, parasites, fungi) or other agent, such as a proteinaceous infectious particle (prion), that can cause disease in humans or animals. Infectious substances may exist as purified and concentrated cultures, but may also be present in a variety of materials, such as body fluids or tissues. Transportation of infectious substances and material s that are known or suspected to contain them are regulated as hazardous materials by the United State Department of Transportation (DOT), foreign governments, and the International Civil Aviation Organization, and their transportation is subject to regula tory controls. For transport purposes, the term \"infectious substance\" is understood to include the term \"etiologic agent.\" Transportation Regulations International and domestic transport regulations for infectious substances are designed to prevent the r elease of these materials in transit to protect the public, workers, property, and the environment from the harmful effects that may occur from exposure to these materials. Protection is achieved through rigorous packaging requirements and hazard communica tion. Packages must be designed to withstand rough handling and other forces experienced in transportation, such as changes in air pressure and temperature, vibration, stacking, and moisture. Hazard communication includes shipping papers, labels, markings on the outside of packagings, and other information necessary to enable transport workers and emergency response personnel to correctly identify the material and respond efficiently in an emergency situation. In addition, shippers and carriers must be trained on these regulations so they can properly prepare shipments and recognize and respond to the risks posed by these materials. Select agents include infectious substances that have been identified by the CDC and the USDA as having the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety. Persons who offer for transportation or transport select agents in commerce in the United States must develop and implement security plans for such transportation. A security plan must include an assessment of t he possible transportation security risks for materials covered by the security plan and specific measures to reduce or eliminate the assessed risks. At a minimum, a security plan must include measures to address those risks associated with personnel secur ity, en route security, and unauthorized access.

General DOT Packaging Requirements for Transport of Infectious Substances by Aircraft The DOT packagings for transporting infectious substances by aircraft are required by domestic an d international aircraft carriers, and are the basis for infectious substance packagings for motor vehicle, railcar, and vessel transport. The following is a summary of each packaging type and related transportation requirements. Category A Infectious Su bstance (UN 2814 and UN 2900): Figure 1. A Category A material is an infectious substance that is transported in a form that is capable of causing permanent disability or life- threatening or fatal disease to otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposur e to it occurs. An exposure occurs when an infectious substance is released outside of its protective packaging, resulting in physical contact with humans or animals. Category A infectious substances are assigned to identification number \"UN 2814\" for substances that cause disease in humans or in both humans and animals, or \"UN 2900\" for substances that cause disease in animals only. Figure 1 shows an example of the UN standard triple packaging system for materials known or suspected of being a Categor y A infectious substance. The package consists of a watertight primary receptacle or receptacles; a watertight secondary packaging; for liquid materials, the secondary packaging must contain absorbent material in sufficient quantities to absorb the entire contents of all primary receptacles; and a rigid outer packaging of adequate strength for its capacity, mass, and intended use. Each surface of the external dimension of the packaging must be 100 mm (3.9 inches) or more. The completed package must pass specific performance tests, including a drop test and a water -spray test, and must be capable of withstanding, without leakage, an internal pressure producing a pressure differential of not less than 95 kPa (0.95 bar, 14 psi). The completed package must also be capable of withstanding, without leakage, temperatures in the range of - 40\u00baC to +55\u00baC ( -40\u00baF to 131\u00baF). The completed package must be marked \"Infectious substances, affecting humans, UN 2814\" or \"Infectious substances, affecting animals, UN 2900\" and labeled with a Division 6.2 (infectious substance) label. In addition, the package must be accompanied by appropriate shipping documentation, including a shipping paper and emergency response information. 26 Figure 1. A Category A UN Standard Triple Packaging Biological specimen, Category B (UN 3373): Figure 2. (previously known as Clinical specimen and Diagnostic Specimen). A Category B infectious substance is one that does not meet the criteria for inclusion in Category A. A Category B infectious substance does not cause permanent disability or life -threatening or fatal disease to humans or animals when exposure to it occur s. The proper shipping name for a Category B infectious substance, \"Biological specimen, Category B,\" is assigned to identification number \"UN The proper shipping names \"Diagnostic specimen\" and \"Clinical specimen\" may no longer be used (as of Janua ry 1, 2007). Figure 2 shows an example of the triple packaging system for materials known or suspected of containing a Category B infectious substance. A Category B infectious substance must be placed in a packaging consisting of a leak proof primary rec eptacle, leak proof secondary packaging, and rigid outer packaging. At least one surface of the outer packaging must have a minimum dimension of 100 mm by 100 mm (3.9 inches). The packaging must be of good quality and strong enough to withstand the shocks and loadings normally encountered during transportation. For liquid materials, the secondary packaging must contain absorbent material in sufficient quantities to absorb the entire contents of all primary receptacles. The primary or secondary packaging must be capable of withstanding, without leakage, an internal pressure producing a pressure differential of 95 kPa. The package must be constructed and closed to prevent any loss of contents that might be caused under normal transportation conditions by vibr ation or changes in temperature, humidity, or pressure. The completed package must be capable of passing a 1.2- meter (3.9 feet) drop test. The package must be marked with a diamond- shaped marking containing the identification number \"UN 3373\" and with the proper shipping name \"Biological substance, Category B.\" In addition, the name, address, and telephone number of a person knowledgeable about the material must be provided on a written document, such as an air waybill, or on the package itself. Figure 2. A Category B Non- specification Triple Packaging 27 28 Import Export APHIS plays a vital role in ensuring the free flow of agricultural trade by keeping U.S. agricultural industries free from pests and diseases and certifying that the millions of U.S. agricultural and food products shipped to markets abroad meet the importi ng countries' entry requirements. APHIS makes sure that all imported agricultural products shipped to the United States from abroad meet the Agency's entry requirements to exclude pests and diseases of agriculture. APHIS also keeps export markets open fo r American agricultural products by working to eliminate unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary (SPS) barriers - that is, concerns involving plant and animal health - raised by U.S. trading partners. APHIS' team of technical experts, based in the United Sta tes and abroad, includes scientists, veterinarians, pathologists, and entomologists that advocate on behalf of U.S. agriculture. They build relationships with their agricultural health and regulatory counterparts in other countries and use scientific princ iples to make the case for American agricultural exports, explaining to foreign officials why U.S. commodities are safe to import. APHIS played a direct role in opening new markets and retaining and expanding existing market access for U.S. agricultural pr oducts worth billions of dollars annually.
