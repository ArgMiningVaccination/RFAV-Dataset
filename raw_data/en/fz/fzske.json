Of course, over-the-counter topical treatments exist, but if you're averse to any type of \"conventional\" medication, you can start by soaking the anal area regularly in plain warm water ten to fifteen minutes, two to three times a day. Make sure to keep the anal area clean, gently cleansing the skin around your anus with warm water. No soap, alcohol or perfume-based wipes needed. Gently dry with a hair dryer. Avoid dry toilet paper. When it comes to your diet, the first change almost unanimously suggested is increasing your fiber and water intake. Drink more water than you think you need. Start with two full glasses in the morning (not at once) before you leave the house, making sure you provide regular intervals throughout the day to consume additional glasses. Concerning food, certain ones are not as affected by our digestive enzymes, and will pass right through us, absorbing a percentage of water many times its weight. This produces a bulky, but soft stool, making it easy to eliminate without straining being a major factor that causes hemorrhoids. Add fibrous foods gradually to your diet (or risk excess gas, cramping, or diarrhea): Whole Grains (wheat, rice, oatmeal) Legumes and beans Fruits (apples, oranges, raisins) Stringy or green leafy vegetables (carrots, cabbage, green beans) Fiber supplements include: Psyllium Flaxseeds Lastly, in addition to fiber, consider these tips to promote a better bowel movement: Decrease excess straining during bowel movements, only go when you have to. Decrease the time you wait to go. If your job requires long periods of sitting, take breaks, get up and move around for a brisk walk. Even regular exercise can promote bowel function and health. Try sitting on a doughnut shaped cushion, taking pressure off your sensitive area. Don't scratch hemorrhoid area, and don't over-wipe. Wear breathable fabrics that are soft and less irritating than synthetic materials. Decrease your weight, placing less strain on your bottom, and, of course, your body overall. Reduce the amount of time you spend on the toilet (leave the book, kindle or magazine elsewhere) Natural Remedies There are also these inexpensive natural remedies you can use at home: A soft heated medical dressing: You can use potatoes that have been blended from small chunks until liquefied, moist, and spread over a thin gauze, folded in half and applied to the hemorrhoidal area for five-to-ten minutes to smooth pain. You can also use a warm, wet teabag that contain natural tannins to produce a similar effect. Also rich in tannins, dabbing hemorrhoids with cotton, soaked in undistilled witch hazel will reduce swelling and pain. If fiber isn't making the cut, try a natural laxative in conjunction to it. A diet with just one-to-three prunes a day will help soften stools. These are short-term solutions however. Also, if you're going to try a softener other than prunes, make sure to avoid ones with mineral oil, since it can interfere with the absorption of some essential nutrients, such as Vitamin A. If itching or burning has you down, use apple cider or distilled white vinegar to help provide relief. The astringent properties can facilitate the shrinking of swollen blood vessels. Also, a topical application of chamomile or calendula can help with this as well. Try frequently applying aloe vera gel to the anal area for soothing relief, and the promotion of healing. If these solutions fail to work, and your hemorrhoids do not disappear on their own, it may mean they've become thrombosed. If this is the case, you may need to explore other options, including surgery. "}
