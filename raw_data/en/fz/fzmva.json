After age 20, most women experience a decline in HGH levels due to the natural decrease in the body. A woman's body, lifestyle, and mental health can be negatively affected by growth hormone deficiency (GHD). Men also face lower HGH levels due to aging. Growth hormone deficiency causes decreased energy, sex drive, and muscle mass as you age, but using advanced treatments like [sermorelin HGH](https://www.balancehormoneoklahoma.com/contents/men/sermorelin-hgh-treatment-for-men) helps those dealing with the symptoms of PA-C](https://www.balancehormoneoklahoma.com/provider/gordon-hart-pa-c), and [Lisa Hargis, NP](https://www.balancehormoneoklahoma.com/provider/lisa-hargis), at [Balance Hormone Center](https://www.balancehormoneoklahoma.com/about), help men and women in the Norman, Oklahoma, area by addressing issues related to GHD. The natural treatment methods we offer, such as [sermorelin HGH](https://www.balancehormoneoklahoma.com/contents/women/sermorelin-hgh-treatment), provide a wide range of benefits without the risk of painful side effects. What is sermorelin? Sermorelin is a bioidentical hormone that's recently been genetically engineered to stimulate growth hormone secretion from the hypothalamus, a gland next to the pituitary gland. A unique, naturally occurring peptide, sermorelin releases growth hormone to stimulate the pituitary gland to release HGH. Synthetic HGH replacement therapy options cause an unnatural rise in HGH, but sermorelin works to stimulate your HGH production throughout the day consistently. Consequently, treatment is more effective, and you experience reduced side effects. We inject sermorelin into body fat, an anti-aging treatment that helps restore your body's HGH levels. Usually, you only need one daily injection of sermorelin to combat the symptoms of GHD. But because the effects of sermorelin are long-lasting, we can decrease or stop these injections altogether once we identify proper levels of HGH. Why should I use sermorelin? Your body experiences lots of different changes as you age. Once you reach the age of 30, your body begins to produce less HGH, causing physical symptoms and changes as part of this natural aging process. Some of these changes include drier hair, lethargy, a decline in cognitive response rate, and slower recovery from injuries. This also includes changes in your appearance and your sense of well-being. You might notice that activities that were once easy are becoming more challenging, such as playing sports or hiking. Your metabolism tanks, but sermorelin treatments can give you the boost you need to continue living your best, most active life. Benefits of sermorelin HGH treatment With lessened HGH production, your body can't fight off the changes that occur as you grow older. HGH plays an essential role in regulating and stimulating the growth of new tissues, but there are many other benefits to sermorelin treatment: - Increased energy - Decreased body aches like joint and muscle pain - Improved sleep - Increased sex drive - Increased muscle mass - Boost in metabolism - Improved bone density - Improved mental acuity These treatments also improve the health of your nails, skin, and hair. Sermorelin can help you heal faster after accidents or in post-surgery recovery. Chronic pain decreases, and brain fog disappears.
