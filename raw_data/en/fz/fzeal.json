Traditional knowledge systems like Ayurveda which can create high impact on physic and psyche but poorly explored in these days. Ayurvedic system has a potential branch named satvavajaya chikitsa where a person's mind has been treated as a whole, not independently out of the body. Many Ayurvedic therapies are efficient enough to bring normalcy of the mind but if we add counseling and psychotherapy can bring higher value additions. Many Ayurvedic procedures (shirodhara - continuous pouring of medication over the head for a prescribed period of time) has a potential to create a semi-hypnotic stage and at that stage many interventions are highly effective like counseling and psychotherapy.
