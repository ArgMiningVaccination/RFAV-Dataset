These developments usher a need to develop evidence-based methods for undermining the persuasive appeal of such groups and their disinformation-based messaging. To this end, a two-phase project is proposed to: (a)define, describe and document the rapidly growing nature and extent of the right-wing extremist disinformation ecosystem and how it influences radicalization and mobilization processes in the U.S., and (b)evaluate attitudinal inoculation as a strategy for combatting right-wing extremist disinformation. One critical feature of the proposed effort will be a workshop attended by top right-wing extremism researchers, policymakers, and security specialists. Using input from the workshop, we (in coordination with Google Jigsaw) will construct and test via real-world interventions, inoculation messages that diminish the persuasiveness of right-wing disinformation and increase the effectiveness of messages challenging that disinformation. Finally, we will develop a suite of operational tools, for use by a variety of stakeholders, to help negate the persuasiveness of right- wing extremist disinformation and reduce violence performed in support of it. 1 Project Narrative 1. Needs Assessment Right-Wing Violent Extremism In July of 2019, FBI Director Christopher Wray appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to speak about the threat of terrorism facing the country. During his testimony, Wray indicated that most domestic terrorism cases investigated by the FBI that year had been related to what he called \"white supremacist violence.\" Acknowledging the rapid expansion of activity, Wray further testified to the House Judiciary Committee in February of this year that \"the top threat we face from domestic violent extremists stems from those we now identify as racially/ethnically motivated extremists.\" He went on to designate right-wing violent extremism a domestic threat priority for 2020 and beyond.2 Despite a growing recognition of the increased domestic threat posed by this particular type of violence, dynamic changes in how right-wing violent extremists recruit members, promote radicalization, or motivate violence makes it difficult to develop tools and practices for combatting their appeal. One alarming phenomenon that has emerged as a key driver of right-wing extremist recruitment, radicalization, and violence is the proliferation of disinformation in support of right-wing extremist ideologies. Disinformation Disinformation has purposeful (and often malicious) intent to mislead audiences in support of objectives. These objectives can be relatively trivial (e.g., many hackers and trolls use disinformation to direct Internet traffic to specific pages, generating advertising income for themselves 3), but disinformation can also be used for more substantial, strategic ends. Political actors often use disinformation to sway elections in support of their ambitions, undermine democratic institutions, 4 and gain leverage over rivals.5 Similarly, violent extremists propagate online disinformation consistent with the goals of their ideologies. This disinformation reverberates within ideological echo chambers, eventually becoming normalized for the individuals within it.6 As several recent cases of right-wing violence have shown, the spread of disinformation can trigger radicalization processes that have deadly repercussions.' For instance, right-wing violent extremists have downplayed the lethality of COVID-19 in an attempt to amplify perceptions of government overreach and accelerate a militant uprising in the U.S. In April of 2020, the Tech Transparency Project found 125 Facebook groups dedicated to what far-right extremists call \"the Boogaloo,\" an impending civil war.8 Although the \"Boogaloo\" 1 Matt Zapotosky, \"Wray says FBI has recorded about 100 domestic terrorism arrests in fiscal 2019 and many investigations involve white supremacy,\" The Washington Post, July 23, 2019. 2 Christopher Wray, Statement Before the House Judiciary Committee, Washington DC, February 5, 2020. 3 See Ion Mihai Pacepa and Ronald J. Rychlak, Disinformation: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, Attacking Religion, and Promoting Terrorism (Washington, DC: WND Books, 2013). 4W.

D. Silva. (Bingley, UK: Emerald, 2020b). 7 Kurt Braddock and John F. Morrison, \"Cultivating Trust and Perceptions of Source Credibility in Online Counternarratives Intended to Reduce Support for Terrorism,\" Studies in Conflict & Terrorism 43, no. 6 (2020). 8 Extremists are Using Facebook to Organize Civil War Amid Coronavirus, Tech Transparency Project, April 22, 2020. 2 is often described satirically or as a viral mimetic phenomenon, discussions on the Facebook groups concerning the \"Boogaloo\" increasingly focus on COVID-19, and include tactical information on engaging in violence, including the development of homemade explosives. The potential for disinformation to motivate right-wing extremist violence demands that we urgently identify methods for fighting it. Ideally, any communicative strategy for challenging the appeal of right-wing extremist disinformation would accomplish two goals. First, it would reduce the persuasiveness of right-wing extremist disinformation. Second, it would boost the effectiveness of counter-messages intended to challenge that disinformation. Attitudinal inoculation holds potential as a communicative strategy that can achieve both goals. Attitudinal Inoculation Inoculation theory contends that if people (a) perceive a threat of an imminent attempt to change their beliefs or attitudes and (b) are given information needed to refute the arguments they will encounter, they are more likely to resist persuasion by those arguments. 9 The theory is a psychological analog to medical inoculation, which involves the introduction of a weakened virus into the body. The immune response triggered by the weakened virus is not so intense as to make the patient ill, but should be strong enough to trigger the development of antibodies that protect the patient against future exposures to the virus. Attitudinal inoculation works in a similar way. Just as medical inoculation is intended to maintain healthy bodily functioning, attitudinal inoculation is intended to maintain healthy (i.e., preferred) beliefs and attitudes. When individuals recognize threats posed by future persuasive attacks against their currently-held beliefs and attitudes, they are motivated to reject those persuasive attacks and maintain their current positions. A defining, and exciting, feature of inoculation is its documented effectiveness in many domains, including violent extremism. i\u00b0 A second type of inoculation message also elicits threat, but rather than warn the target of impending persuasive attempts (as in a traditional inoculation message), they warn the target of feelings they may experience in response to a persuasive message, thereby reducing the counter- persuasive power of those feelings. In this case, the message target would be warned that they may feel anger or counter-argue against what the speaker is about to say.11 Whereas traditional inoculation messages raise audience defenses against future persuasive attempts, inoculation messages that warn of audience pushback against persuasion induce targets to \"let their guard down,\" making them receptive to persuasive messages delivered by the speaker. Given that attitudinal inoculation has been shown to (a) protect against persuasion by messages from \"undesirable\" sources and (b) facilitate persuasion by messages from \"friendly\" sources, it follows that inoculation strategies could prove useful in combating the proliferation of online disinformation by right-wing violent extremists that intend to sow discord, promote distrust in key institutions, and inspire violent action. Target Population and Added Value 9 William J. McGuire, \"Inducing Resistance to Persuasion: Some Contemporary Approaches,\" in Advances in Experimental Social Psychology 1, edited by Leonard Berkowitz (New York: Academic Press, 1964): 191-229. 10 See John A. Banas and Stephen A. Rains, \"A Meta-Analysis of Research Using Inoculation to Confer Resistance to Persuasion by Extremist Propaganda,\" Terrorism and Political Violence (2019). 11 Richards and Banas, \"Inoculating against Reactance to Persuasive Health Messages.\" 3 There are several efforts afoot to diminish the persuasive efficacy of extremist disinformation. 12 Despite the promise demonstrated by such initiatives, we lack a thorough understanding of the nature, extent, influence and effect of ideas that comprise the various elements of the fight-wing disinformation ecosystem. Consequently, there are no evidence-based tools for practitioners to quickly and easily adapt messaging campaigns against right-wing disinformation. The work proposed in the current effort seeks to redress this deficiency by... (a)...developing knowledge of right-wing extremist disinformation, including themes that comprise it and most effectively resonate with audiences. Through these activities, we seek to map the right-wing violent extremism ecosystem and disinformation's role within it. To assist in this mapping exercise, we will develop a comprehensive, systematic review of literature and related source material, bring together a pool of experts, and maintain an advisory clearinghouse for those that seek counsel on right-wing extremist groups and activities (including their use of disinformation). Informed by this activity, we (b)...engage in real-world testing of attitudinal inoculation as a means of protecting vulnerable populations (typically males, aged 18-35) from persuasion via on- and offline disinformation consistent with right-wing violent extremist ideologies, and from (a) and (b)... (c)...produce tools, guides, and strategies for use by practitioners (to include DHS and relevant 'customers' identified with the help of DHS input) to facilitate the design and implementation of on- and offline inoculation campaigns that diminish the persuasiveness of right-wing extremist disinformation and increase the persuasiveness of messages intended to counter it. 2. Program Design Problem Statement Right-wing violent extremists increasingly use disinformation to cause confusion, garner support, and inspire violence. We currently lack any evidence-based means of challenging this. Equipping practitioners and end-users with data-driven tools would mitigate the effectiveness of violent right-wing violent extremist disinformation by reducing its persuasive efficacy. Program Goals The goals of the proposed research are consistent with Objectives 1 and 2 outlined in Goal 3 of the the DHS Strategic Framework for Countering Terrorism and Targeted Violence (CTTV). Objective 1 seeks to strengthen societal resistance against the drivers of violent extremism and ensure broad awareness of the threat of targeted violence and terrorism. Accordingly, this project seeks to (a) raise awareness of right-wing extremist disinformation and demonstrate how it is used to promote violent extremism and mobilization to violence among them, (b) increase resistance to radicalization by right-wing extremist disinformation, and (c) increase receptiveness to counter-messaging targeting right-wing extremist disinformation. Objective 2 seeks to counter terrorists and violent extremists' influence online. Accordingly, the proposed project is also designed to (a) strengthen audience critical thinking skills with respect to online right-wing extremist disinformation, (b) increase audience skepticism of online right-wing extremist disinformation, (c) increase audience resistance to online right-wing 12 See, for example, work by the U.S. Department of State's Global Engagement Center, Moonshot CVE (a London- based NGO), and the Center for Countering Digital Hate. 4 extremist disinformation narratives that promote radicalization, and (d) increase the efficacy of right-wing extremist disinformation counter-messaging efforts by tech companies, non- government organizations, government agencies, and members of civil society.

Project Inputs This project represents a collaborative effort between researchers at American University (AU), Georgia State University (GSU), and co-investigators with unique access to data and research capabilities (e.g., Google Jigsaw). The overall effort will be directed by PI Braddock (AU), who will be responsible for the overall technical, financial direction and strategic management of the project. At GSU, Co-PI Horgan has significant experience in the management of complex research projects. Braddock and Horgan will work closely together on every aspect of the project, and will identify, track, and manage project progress and disseminate project information to all personnel across and within local and partnering institutions. Braddock will manage and oversee the overall research process and with Horgan, will jointly lead the generation and dissemination of the detailed analyses of the research effort. Braddock and Horgan will assume coordination responsibilities to ensure milestones are met and deliverables produced on time and on budget. Coordination will be handled by bi-weekly teleconference 6 meetings between AU, GSU, and Google Jigsaw. We will also hold quarterly in-person meetings between PI Braddock and Co-PI Horgan for each year of the project. At AU, we will recruit and train a PhD-level student to help with data verification and analysis. This student will be competitively recruited from the School of Communication PhD cohort and will work on the project for 20 hours per week. This student will be supported by Braddock (who will act as the person's primary supervisor). The student will be trained in data analysis as per project needs and will be assigned tasks to support critical project functions. Overseen by Beth Goldberg, Google Jigsaw will provide research input activities primarily in Phase 2. Specifically, Jigsaw will work closely with PI Braddock and Co-PI Horgan to (a) identify populations at risk of exposure to disinformation in support of right-wing violent extremism and (b) implement the pilot interventions to samples drawn from those populations. Jigsaw was specifically invited to assist on this project because of its long history of domestic counter-radicalization intervention activities, including those performed on right-wing extremists. Finally, Caty Borum-Chattoo and AU's Center for Media and Social Impact will provide specific expertise, equipment, and personnel to professionally develop the video stimuli to be used in the Phase 2 pilot tests. Taken together, the research team boasts the experience, networks and aptitude to implement all proposed activities. Moreover, American University, Georgia State University, and Google Jigsaw collectively possess the resources to execute all proposed activities (e.g, workshop space, equipment for media production). Program Activities Given available inputs, we plan to implement project activities over two phases. In the first phase of the project, all activities will be geared towards developing a comprehensive knowledge base concerning the role of disinformation in the propagation of right-wing violent extremist ideologies and engagement in violence in support of them. The second phase will comprise activities intended to evaluate attitudinal inoculation as a viable intervention strategy for reducing right-wing extremist violence inspired by disinformation. Phase 1 Program Activities. These focus on developing a comprehensive knowledge base related to the use of disinformation to motivate right-wing extremist violence. These include: 1.Literature Review on Disinformation and Right-Wing Violent Extremism. The first step in the analysis of any phenomenon should be a survey of the current state of understanding. We will perform a comprehensive literature review on issues surrounding disinformation and right- wing violent extremism from work in terrorism studies, psychology, sociology, criminology, and related fields. As part of this, we will evaluate how different right-wing violent extremist ideologies have used disinformation to achieve strategic objectives. 2.Database on Right-wing Extremist Violence and Disinformation (REV-D). Whereas the literature review will synthesize current knowledge related to disinformation and right-wing extremist violence, this project will also seek to provide up-to-date data on events and actors in which disinformation played a role in the performance of right-wing extremist violence. To this end, we will compile a comprehensive database of incidents (starting in the year 2000) in which right-wing extremist violence was inspired (in whole or in part) by disinformation. The database will be made publicly available to facilitate continued analysis of the phenomenon. 3.Workshop on Right-wing Violent Extremism and Disinformation. To supplement the literature review and database, we plan to host a three-day meeting of the foremost experts on right-wing violent extremism, radicalization, and disinformation. This workshop will meet at American University in Washington, DC and involve academics, media experts, former right- 7 wing extremists, and others with critical relevant knowledge. The workshop goals are twofold. First, it will identify themes underpinning disinformation that motivate right-wing violent extremists. This knowledge will (a) inform policymakers' and practitioners' efforts to counter disinformation and (b) guide the development of inoculation messages to be tested in Phase 2. Second, this workshop will serve as the opening meeting of a working group that may be of interest to policymakers and practitioners in the future. Rather than have a \"one-off' meeting, we intend to maintain an active network of experts on far-right domestic extremism, terrorism, and disinformation that will be well-positioned to help security specialists respond to emerging challenges. We have contacted multiple experts on right-wing extremism about their willingness to share their expertise and join the working group.13 4.Writeup of Programmatic and Financial Reports to DHS. Per the requirements of the funding, the research team will compile Programmatic and Financial Reports for DHS on a quarterly basis. We will also produce monthly progress reports on all activities. 5.Dissemination Activities. Given the value of the knowledge created about right-wing violent extremism and disinformation during Phase 1, it will be imperative to share this knowledge with practitioners and policymakers. Braddock and Horgan will make use of their extensive academic and professional networks to organize briefings and disseminate one- to three-page briefs on all findings related to the literature review, database, and workshop. In addition to sharing Phase 1 results with policymakers and practitioners, we plan to present our findings to academic audiences via academic conferences on issues related to security, violent extremism, and terrorism. Knowledge gained from activities related to the development of the literature review, the compiling of data concerning right-wing violent extremism and disinformation, and the organization of the workshop will provide sufficient material to produce a number of academic publications during Phase 1 as well. Furthermore, we will publish a special issue of Terrorism and Political Violence focusing on right-wing violent extremism and disinformation. This issue will contain articles selected by the PI and Co-PI as the best papers presented at the workshop described in Item 3. This will be simultaneously released as a book to be published by Routledge's Political Violence Series. Phase 2 Program Activities. These activities will center on the evaluation of attitudinal inoculation as a strategy for (a) increasing resistance to right-wing violent extremist disinformation and (b) increasing the efficacy of counter-messaging. These activities include: 1. Real-World Tests of Inoculation as a Strategy for Combating Violent Right-Wing Extremist Disinformation. The centerpiece of the second phase of the overall project will be a series of empirical evaluations that test attitudinal inoculation as a strategy for (a) increasing resistance to right-wing violent extremist disinformation and (b) decreasing resistance to counter-messages intended to challenge right-wing violent extremist disinformation. In contrast to past evaluations of intervention strategies, these tests will be performed using real-world subjects vulnerable to persuasion by right-wing violent extremist disinformation. Specifically, we will coordinate with the Google Jigsaw project to identify a sample of young (aged 18-35), white individuals that are likely to be targeted with online right-wing violent disinformation in support of violence.14 13 Invitees that have expressed interest in attending include Kathleen Belew, J.M. Berger, Tore Bjorgo, Kathleen Blee, Caleb Cain, Peter Simi, Helen Taylor, and Renske van der Veer. 14 See the attached Letter of Cooperation from Beth Goldberg, Research Manager at the Google Jigsaw project. 8 To ensure that we can adequately (p <0.05) detect small effects (f? 0.15) with sufficient statistical power ([1 - (3] = 0.80), we will recruit no fewer than 650 subjects for participation. Once recruited, these individuals will provide consent to participate and complete a brief prescreen index to ensure they are eligible to participate. If deemed eligible, participants will be randomly assigned to one of five groups. Two of the five groups will be exposed to traditional inoculation messages that warn of an impending persuasion attempt via right-wing violent extremist disinformation. One of these traditional inoculation conditions will inoculate participants against disinformation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The other traditional inoculation will inoculate participants against disinformation concerning \"The Great Replacement\" (TGR) -- a supposed plot to replace white Americans with minorities through immigration. Following inoculation treatments, these participants will be respectively directed to right-wing violent extremist disinformation related to COVID-19 and TGR. Following this, they will complete a survey comprised of multiple measures to indicate the degree to which they were persuaded by the disinformation. In two other conditions, participants will be exposed to reactance inoculation messages that warn them that they will be exposed to counter-messaging that intends to persuade them to dismiss right-wing violent extremist disinformation. In one of reactance inoculation conditions, participants will be told that they may be exposed to messages designed to persuade them to dismiss COVlD-19 disinformation. In the other reactance inoculation condition, participants will be informed that they may be exposed to messages designed to persuade them to dismiss anything they see about TGR. In both of these conditions, participants will be warned that they may counter-argue or feel anger against the subsequent messages. After being exposed to the reactance inoculation messages, participants will be directed to right-wing violent extremist disinformation related to COVID-19 and TGR, respectively. They will then be surveyed on their responses. In the fifth condition, participants will be exposed to a no-inoculation control message that does not warn them of any impending attempts to persuade them, either by disinformation or messages that challenge that disinformation. Following exposure to this message, participants will be randomly assigned to view one of the disinformation messages or the counter-messages challenging the disinformation. The latter groups will then also be exposed to the disinformation propaganda as well. As in the treatment groups, all control group participants will then go on to complete all post-test measures. By structuring the evaluations in this way, we can draw conclusions about: The effectiveness of inoculation across topics pervading right-wing extremist disinformation; The degree to which traditional inoculation messages confer resistance to persuasion via right-wing extremist disinformation; The degree to which reactance inoculation messages reduce resistance to persuasion via counter-messaging intended to challenge right-wing extremist disinformation; The optimal inoculation strategy for challenging disinformation: increasing resistance to that disinformation, reducing negative responses to counter-messaging that targets that disinformation, or some combination thereof; and The optimal focus of counter-messaging efforts intended to challenge disinformation. 2. Research Support Activities with Google Jigsaw. To assist in the evaluation of inoculation as a strategy for combating violent right-wing extremist disinformation, PI Braddock and Co-PI Horgan will engage with Google Jigsaw analysts to (a) identify online populations of specific dispositions to find and recruit individuals (white, mostly male, aged 18-35) who are at greatest risk for radicalization by violent right-wing extremist disinformation and (b) analyze and 9 interpret not only the data collected from measurement instruments that are administered as part of the pilot tests, but also the data on participant characteristics (to the degree allowed by Google privacy requirements). 3.Research Support Activities with AU's Center for Media and Social Impact (CMSD. The development of effective stimulus messages is critical for the successful implementation of our inoculation pilot tests as described in Item 1. Specifically, pilot tests will require the production of five novel video-based messages: two traditional inoculation messages that warn of subsequent exposure to violent right-wing extremist disinformation respectively related to COVID-19 and TGR, two reactance inoculation messages that warn of subsequent exposure to counter-messages that respectively challenge disinformation related to COVID-19 and TGR, and one no-inoculation control video. With close oversight from PI Braddock, the direction, production, and editing of these videos will be performed by the Center for Media and Social Impact (CMSI) in the School of Communication at American University. 15 All videos will feature professionally trained actors and actresses delivering the inoculation or control messages, and produced by professionally trained media experts. 4.Dissemination Activities. Activities geared towards disseminating the results of the inoculation pilot tests and their implications for dealing with violent right-wing extremist disinformation and its role in violent radicalization will be similar to those described in Phase 1. That is, briefings and \"quick-win\" documents will be regularly provided to security practitioners and U.S. Government institutions, with the addition of the International Association of the Chiefs of Police. In addition, the involvement of Google Jigsaw in Phase 2 will also allow us to disseminate program findings to policymakers in the tech sector, including Facebook, Twitter, and Microsoft. Phase 2 dissemination activities that target academics and practitioners will be similar to academic dissemination activities in Phase 1. Specifically, we will present Phase 2 pilot test results at widely attended conferences and in peer-reviewed academic journals. Program Outputs The proposed activities are designed to produce unique outputs that contribute to intended outcomes. Both the short- and long-term outcomes associated with the project will produce knowledge allowing researchers and practitioners to systematically engage with and address violent right-wing extremist disinformation. This, in turn, will reduce the incidence of violent activity performed as a result of audience interaction with this disinformation. Specific project outputs that contribute to overall program success include: 1.A systematic literature review on right-wing violent extremism and disinformation; 2.A comprehensive database of right-wing violent incidents (and their perpetrators) inspired (at least in part) by disinformation; 3.A synopsis of the right-wing violent extremist disinformation workshop, including detailed summaries of each speaker's presentation and discussions between experts; 4.An ontology of terms and concepts related to the right-wing violent ideological ecosystem and the role of disinformation within it; 5.A clearinghouse of experts on right-wing violent extremism and disinformation, access to which (pending expert availability) can be made available to researchers and practitioners 6.A comprehensive report on findings related to inoculation field tests; 7.One- to three-page \"quick wins\" to summarize project activities and outputs; 8.Monthly updates and quarterly programmatic and financial reports to DHS; 15 See the attached Letter of Cooperation from CSMI Director Caty Borum-Chattoo. 10 9.Academic outputs, including a special issue of Terrorism and Political Violence on disinformation and right-wing violent extremism, peer-reviewed journal articles on other project outputs (e.g., results of inoculation pilot tests), conference presentations; and 10.Strategic guides for recognizing and analyzing themes that underpin disinformation, developing inoculation messages intended to reduce persuasiveness of right-wing violent extremist disinformation/increase the persuasiveness of counter-messages targeting violent right-wing extremist disinformation Program Short-Term Outcomes The proposed activities and outputs will act as an antidote for weaknesses in research direction surrounding domestic right-wing violent extremism that have been thus far dependent on short- term research funding and/or limited systematic attention. They will integrate proven theory with practice, which will lead to real-world benefits. They will facilitate conceptual discussion about the role of disinformation in the perpetuation of domestic right-wing violent extremism -- discussion that is often difficult in the context of political frameworks or given the immediacy of practitioner demands. They will also contribute to knowledge and a critical appreciation of violent right-wing extremist disinformation among relevant practitioners, policy makers, and academic experts. To be sure, such broad outcomes are critical. However, it is just as important to recognize specific short-term proposed outcomes: 1.Phase 1: The systematic literature review will directly contribute to a shared understanding of the phenomenon of violent right-wing extremism, including disinformation strategies employed by right-wing extremists for the purposes of recruitment and radicalization. Such actionable knowledge will directly contribute to the training of analysts, practitioners, and other national security responders. 2.Phase 1: The workshop event will directly lead to an increase in awareness and practical knowledge surrounding the nature and extent of themes that pervade violent right-wing extremist disinformation and the role it plays in promoting domestic terrorism. The workshop will also assist in developing a shared research agenda focused on domestic right-wing terrorism, thereby contributing to its prioritization as a key threat facing the American homeland. Moreover, the workshop will result in a shared ontology to help researchers and practitioners to move beyond definitional debates that stall progress and measurement of effective interventions. Finally, the workshop will serve as a natural opportunity for researchers and practitioners to network, exchange and challenge ideas. 3.Phase 1: The REV-D database will afford practitioners increased access to systematic data on violent incidents predicated on right-wing extremist disinformation and their perpetrators. Access to these data will facilitate secondary analyses far beyond the term of the proposed work. 4.Phase 2: The pilot tests for real-world inoculation interventions will directly lead to an understanding of the degree to which attitudinal inoculation confers resistance to violent right-wing extremist disinformation and reduces resistance to counter-messaging that targets such disinformation. These pilot tests will also demonstrate to practitioners how best to structure inoculation messages for use in the field. 5.Phase 2: Increased knowledge transfer with Google Jigsaw will directly promote cooperation between the tech sector, researchers, and practitioners. Despite calls for increased coordination between these entities, there remains a divide between them. This is unfortunate, given the consistency of our goals with respect to reducing domestic terrorist violence. Consider 11 that Google Jigsaw explicitly states that \"through on-the-ground research and partnerships, we work to find new solutions to keep everyone safer.\" Consistent with these goals, we will teach Google Jigsaw about the nature of right-wing violent extremism, Google Jigsaw will teach us about the identification of those vulnerable to persuasion by disinformation from violent right- wing extremists, and together, we will identify emerging issues and inoculation-related solutions for contending with them. These outcomes will be achieved through training modules, workshops, and regular meetings between all members of the research team. 6.Phase 2 knowledge transfer with DHS S&T. Training modules and workshops with DHS personnel, in which we will discuss the threat of right-wing violent extremism, the psychological implications of disinformation, the practical development of inoculation messages to reduce the negative associated outcomes. Working with DHS to identify and develop practice- ready products that would be useful for dissemination to relevant partners. Program Long-Term Outcomes Ultimately, project activities and outputs will use the findings, theories and methods of the behavioral and social sciences to help reduce the threat of right-wing violent extremism, and will build and sustain national, multidisciplinary, multi-agency collaboration to achieve multiple objectives. Specifically, this project's activities are designed to exert lasting effects on violent right-wing disinformation and the domestic threats it promotes. These include: 1.Increased resilience to persuasion by disinformation among those targeted by violent right-wing extremist propaganda 2.Increased persuasive effectiveness of counter-messaging that targets violent right-wing extremist disinformation 3.Decreased susceptibility to violent radicalization stemming from exposure to violent right-wing extremist disinformation 4.Decreased incidence of domestic terrorism stemming from exposure to violent right-wing extremist disinformation 5.Increased community safety owing to reduced likelihood of domestic terrorist incidents Contextual Factors and Underlying Assumptions The multidisciplinary perspective proposed both through the methodological approach and the background of the assembled team will essentially allow us to treat individual, social and community-level factors associated with disinformation as an integrated whole, and encourages a systematic, and ultimately more comprehensive consideration of the factors affecting disinformation and associated efforts to mitigate it. This kind of collaboration, particularly between the fields of communication (Braddock) and psychology (Horgan) will result in deeper consideration of theoretical and conceptual issues, along with innovative methodological sophistication and rigor. Across both basic research functions (e.g. research design, data collection, etc.) and project management activities, the assembled team has tried and tested protocols which have been formulated, streamlined and successfully implemented across multiple prior collaborations by Co-PI Horgan on DHS-funded, NIJ-funded, and DOD-funded (via the Minerva Initiative) research project. Previous success with these activities will streamline activities for this project. Moreover, the universities at which activities will be carried out are optimally equipped to carry out the proposed work. American University, where PI Braddock and the CMSI are based, is located in Washington, DC, facilitating access to policymakers, security professionals, the intelligence community, and the Department of 12 Homeland Security itself. Georgia State University, where co-PI Horgan is based, is well equipped to handle project activities as well as to help in the dissemination of its emergent products. Both AU and GSU have long-produced tools of use to the security and intelligence communities, having been funded by a wide variety of security agencies, governments, and science directorates. Finally, although the COVID-19 pandemic has threatened a significant amount of empirical work, all personnel on the project are experienced in the coordination of networking and research activities online. As a result, should the need arise, most (if not all) activities proposed can be carried out virtually. 3.Organization and Key Personnel Professor Kurt Braddock, American University (Principal Investigator) Dr. Kurt Braddock is an Assistant Professor of Public Communication in the School of Communication at American University. He is also an associated faculty fellow at AU's Polarization and Extremism Research and Interventions Lab (PERIL) and the School of Communication's Center for Media and Social Impact (CSMI). A specialist on the topics of communication, radicalization, and terrorism, Dr. Braddock has authored several peer-reviewed journal articles, chapters, and books on issues surrounding the use of persuasion in processes that contribute to (or diminish) violent radicalization. He has worked on grants from a variety of funding entities, including the U.S. Office of Naval Research, the National Institute of Justice, and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Professor John Horgan, Georgia State University (Co-Principal Investigator) Dr. John Horgan is Distinguished University Professor at the Georgia State University's Department of Psychology. Author of more than 120 publications including several full volumes on the psychology of terrorism, Dr. Horgan is a member of the Research Working Group of the FBI's National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime (NCAVC) and holds a Ph.D. and B.A. in Applied Psychology from University College, Cork. He has significant experience as a performer on social science research grants exceeding $20 million for sponsors including the U.S. Department of Defense Minerva Initiative, multiple grants awarded from the Office of Naval Research, NIJ, DHS, DTRA, and many others. Professor Caty Borum-Chattoo, Center for Media and Social Impact, American University Dr. Caty Borum Chattoo is Executive Director of the Center for Media & Social Impact (CMSI), an innovation lab and research center at American University that creates, showcases and studies media designed for social change; and Assistant Professor at the American University School of Communication in Washington, D.C. Her recent research and creative work in media, entertainment and social change has been supported by more than 30 external grants. Beth Goldberg, Google Jigsaw (Data Collection and Research Methods) Ms. Beth Goldberg serves as a research program manager with Jigsaw, a Google initiative meant to predict and confront issues related to the distribution of online extremist content on digital platforms. Jigsaw researchers are trained in mixed-methods approaches to collecting data for the purpose of P/CVE. 4.Sustainability Our sustainability strategy involves a major conference, a mixture of real-time and virtual workshops aimed at law enforcement practitioners, a final research report, individual research papers, conference presentations and research briefs, the development of which will continue beyond the life of the project. Braddock and Horgan both respectively teach graduate level 13 courses on homeland security and terrorism, and findings from the proposed effort will inform lesson plans for educating future generations of national security professionals. We will also work with DHS to identify relevant partners at multiple levels, and while we anticipate dissemination activity to happen organically owing to the team's embeddedness in promoting solutions to targeted violence generally, we anticipate exploring future formalized efforts as well. In addition, Google Jigsaw is a central figure in the tech sector, and is perfectly positioned to distribute our findings, recommendations, and outputs to other technology-focused organizations. Continued collaboration with Beth Goldberg and Google Jigsaw guarantees that the importance of this project will be communicated to policymakers in the tech sector well past its 2022 ending date. 5.

For each outcome in the IMP, create an Implementation Plan table and a Measurement Plan table. Please use the definitions provided in the IMP guidance document when crafting your plan. Draft, in the box below, the overarching goal statement for the project. Following completion of the IMP, each grantee is expected to complete the Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan in Appendix A. In the Implementation Plan table: Type each activity in a separate row; add as many rows as needed. Arrange activity rows chronologically by the start date of the activity. This IMP should span both years of performance under this grant program. In the Measurement Plan table: Type each outcome indicator in a separate row. Include indicators that will help measure the results of the project; it is not necessary to have more than one indicator if that indicator sufficiently measures results. Identify and/or design data collection methods to be used to obtain the data that will be reported on quarterly. Ensure attention to collection of data that can be broken down by sex and age of project participants or beneficiaries. NOTE: Data collection methods should be specific and timebound. Any expenses incurred from the collection of data must come from the grant already awarded. No additional funds will be made available by DHS for this purpose. Organization Name American University Project Title VACCINE-RED: The Viability and Adaptive Capacity of Communicative Inoculation for Neutralizing the Effects of Right-wing Extremist Disinformation Grant Number _ DHS-20-TTP-132-00-01 Grant Implementation Period: October 1, 2020 \u2014 September 30, 2022 (24 months) Reporting Period: Quarterly (Four per year) 1 Project Goal Statement To reduce incidence of violent radicalization and domestic terrorism inspired by right-wing extremist disinformation hy (1) generating knowledge on the role of disinformation in the spread and appeal of fight-wing violent extremist propaganda and ideologies, (2) evaluating attitudinal inoculation as an intervention strategy for combating violent right-wing extremist disinformation and/or amplifying the counter- persuasive effects of extant messaging efforts targeting violent right-wing extremist disinformation, and (3) providing practitioners with evidence-based tools for reducing the persuasiveness of violent right-wing extremist disinformation and increasing receptiveness to counter- messaging that targets such disinformation. Target Population Although the findings produced by the proposed work can benefit all kinds of populations, our focus on violent right-wing disinformation and its potential to facilitate violent radicalization demands that we focus on populations most vulnerable to persuasion by that content. As such, we will work with Google Jigsaw to identify populations of young (aged 18-35), white individuals (most of whom are male) with whom we will test attitudinal inoculation as an intervention strategy. Beneficiaries of this work include the practitioners and policymakers (including those in DHS) who are in a position to develop intervention strategies to stem the rising tide of domestic terrorism coming from right-wing violent extremists. To this end, we seek to produce usable knowledge for government security agencies, P/CVE-oriented NG0s, members of civil society, and other actors that seek evidence-based guidance for the development of effective counter-messaging strategies targeting disinformation messages that promote right-wing violent extremism. 2 OUTCOME 1: Practitioners, researchers, and other experts have a comprehensive and shared understanding of violent right-wing extremism, disinformation, and how the latter perpetuates the former. Mid-Term Outcome 1.1: Researchers and practitioners are better prepared to identify, collect, and analyze relevant scholarly literature and other material on right-wing violent extremism, disinformation, and how the two relate. Mid-Term Outcome 1.2: Researchers and practitioners have comprehensive understanding of the current state of knowledge concerning right-wing violent extremism and disinformation. Mid-Term Outcome 1.3: Researchers and practitioners develop an operational consensus about the themes and terms used in the study of right-wing violent extremism and/or disinformation.

Risks could include, but are not limited to: economic, social, or political changes; changes to planned partnerships; legal or compliance changes; or other risks unique to this project. Use the chart below to identify these risks; add additional rows if necessary. Risk Identified Likelihood of Risk Occurring (low/medium/high) Risk Analysis (brief assessment of the impact the identified risk could/would have on the project) Risk Management Plan (plan to minimize the impact that the risk presents to the project and adjustments to be made if the risk transpires) Re-emergence of COVID-19 in late 2020, with persistence into early 2021 Medium The proposed workshop in Phase 1 could be impacted due to community distancing guidelines, travel restrictions, or other unforeseen barriers to collective gatherings. This could limit the degree to which we could produce detailed knowledge to be carried into Phase 2. Workshop could be held virtually with all attendees participating via Zoom Workshop could be moved to mid-2021, when COVID-19 is expected dissipate and a vaccine is due to be created (focus from Oct 2020\u2014 Mar 2021 would be on literature review and database development) Delay in data collection for Phase 2 owing to IRB amendments proposed work I ,,\\\\ American University's Institutional Review Board may require a longer-than-anticipated review of the project, given our proposal to collect from a non- college sample. This is unlikely, however, as similar studies have not been delayed substantially for this reason (Braddock, in press at Terrorism and Political Violence, e.g.) PI Braddock will be in close contact with American University's IRB from the outset of the project to ensure adherence to all standards long before the start of Phase 2 Workshop participants declining invitations to workshop Low Although we have discussed the workshop with more than 20 experts on right-wing violent extremism and disinformation that have expressed interest in attending, it is possible that some may yet decline invitations if funds are allocated. With too few participants, knowledge gained would be less than anticipated. PI Braddock remains in touch with all invitees to periodically re-affirm interest in attendance at the workshop We have developed a secondary list of 10-15 experts to be invited in the event that some participants drop out CURRICULUM VITAE (MAY 2020) KURT BRADDOCK AMERICAN UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF COMMUNICATION (b)(6) ACADEMIC POSITIONS Assistant Professor of Public Communication (2020 - Present) American University, School of Communication Faculty Fellow, Center for Media and Social Impact, American University Faculty Fellow, Polarization and Extremism Research and Intervention Lab, American University Research Fellow, Center for University Excellence, American University Assistant Teaching Professor (2012 - 2020) Penn State University, Department of Communication Arts and Sciences EDUCATION Ph.D., Communication Arts and Sciences, 2012 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA Dissertation: Fighting Words: The Persuasive Effect of Online Extremist Narrative on the Radicalization Process Dissertation Committee Chair: Dr. James Price Dillard M.A., Communication, 2006 University of Delaware, Newark, DE Thesis: Looking Beyond Biology: The Impact of Psychological Gender on Small Group Leadership Emergence Thesis Committee Chair: Dr. Charles Pavitt B.A., Business Management, 2004 The College of New Jersey, Ewing, NJ RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS BOOKS Braddock, K.

I supervise the team and graduate student fellows on all aspects of research and creative project protocol and design, implementation, data analysis, writing, production, collaboration with artists and civil society organizations, strategic communication, and public dissemination associated with CMSI's media productions, research initiatives, and convenings. I cultivate funding opportunities and serve as principal investigator for externally-funded research and creative initiatives focused on media, social change and equity; I have raised more than $3.2 million in grant and contract funding (approximately 39 grants, contracts, and gifts) since 2013.

Specifically, for this effort funded by the Department of Homeland Security, CMSI, under my supervision, will produce the stimulus videos that reside at the heart of his effort. We are well-positioned to collaboratively facilitate this work given our extensive background and expertise in creative production and media effects research, and my own extensive media credits as a producer and engaged scholar for close to two decades. To provide additional context and qualifications: The Center for Media & Social Impact is a creative innovation lab and research center that creates, studies, and showcases media for social impact. Focusing on independent, documentary, entertainment, and public media, the Center bridges boundaries between scholars, producers and communication practitioners across media production, media impact, public policy, and audience engagement. The Center produces resources for the field and academic research; convenes conferences and events; and works collaboratively to understand and design media that matter. Over the past five years, CMSI has administered more than 40 grants and contracts for creative production and research efforts related to media's powerful role for social good. We look forward to working on this important effort. Sincerely, (b)(6) Gary Borum Chattoo I Professor John Horgan Department of Psychology Georgia State University (b)(6) June 10, 2020 Dear Colleagues: This letter is meant to express my commitment to working with Dr. Kurt Braddock at American University's School of Communication on the project entitled VACCINE-RED: Validating the Adaptable Capacity of Communicative Inoculation to Neutralize the Effects of Right-wing Extremist Disinformation. Specifically, for this effort, funded by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, I will serve as Co-Principal Investigator alongside Dr. Braddock. As Co-PI, I will perform the duties as laid out in the Statement of Work, as well as any emergent duties that will facilitate the successful implementation of the project. In discussions with Dr. Braddock, we have decided upon a split effort in which he will perform 65% of the duties and I will perform 35% (not counting the duties attended to by other collaborators on the project). I have worked with Dr. Braddock for many years and have collaborated on many projects with him; I have no doubt that together, we will effectively carry out the proposed activities. I have authored more than 120 publications related to the psychology of terrorism, and am well- positioned in practitioner circles to effectively disseminate the outputs we produce and the results we discover. I also have extensive experience in working on social science grants related to the psychology of terrorism. These grants (collectively exceeding $20 million), have been earned from multiple security-related sponsors, including the U.S. Department of Defense, the Office of Naval Research, the National Institute of Justice, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and others. Should you have any questions related to my commitment to the project, please do not hesitate to e-mail me a b)(6) Many thanks, Dr. John Horgan .3 JIGSAW Memo re: Documentation of Support To: Department of Homeland Security, TVTP Grant Program From: Beth Goldberg, Research Manager at Jigsaw (Google) Date: May 13, 2020 To whom it may concern, I am writing a letter in support of the project proposed by Kurt Braddock and John Horgan to the TVTP Grant Program. I am a research manager at Jigsaw, a unit within Google focused on protecting people from digital conflict, where I lead a portfolio of initiatives to counter violent extremism and radicalization online. I believe this project has great potential to prevent terrorist radicalization through conferring greater resilience to terrorist messaging. Jigsaw has over a decade of experience in countering violent extremism online. Our researchers have deep mixed methods expertise in CVE, conducting ethnographic fieldwork with ISIS defectors in Iraq and former white supremacists across the US, as well as data science and linguistic models on PVE counternarratives. For this study, Jigsaw researchers will advise on study design, respondent sampling, stimuli and treatment messaging, and selection of the messenger. Additionally, Jigsaw will leverage our position within Google to share findings with policymakers and technologists in influential roles in the tech industry. For this project, the Jigsaw team intends to work closely with the principal investigators on at least two project components. First, we plan to contribute to the process of identifying at-risk populations who are most susceptible to radicalization to reach with interventions. Second, we plan to help implement and analyze the two inoculation treatments, including a traditional inoculation method and a new, promising avenue of research that can help users to better discern similar inoculative techniques by terrorist actors. Jigsaw is optimistic about this approach to countering radicalization and our team is currently supporting two separate foundational studies on inoculative messages. We fully support this project as the logical next step from these studies and a vital expansion of the field of knowledge on inoculation for countering violent extremism. We are familiar with the high quality research by Kurt Braddock, having collaborated with him already on a PVE study. We have relied upon his extensive work in the counter-narrative and counter-radicalization field for years. We are confident that this collaboration with Kurt and John will produce high quality, actionable insights that can inform future technology products and existing product policies that will protect end users online. J JIGSAW Sincerely, Elizabeth Goldberg moonshot 15 June 2020 To whom it may concern, I hope this letter finds you well. My name is Ross Frenett and I am the founder and CEO of Moonshot CVE. Moonshot has developed and implemented a wide array of data-based intervention programs intended to challenge terrorist ideologies all around the world. Thus far, we have implemented over 100 programs aimed at directing vulnerable audiences away from radicalizing content. In addition to several other programs, I am currently in the process of designing and executing programs intended to mitigate the radicalizing potential of right-wing extremist propaganda in the United States through various intervention strategies. I have known Kurt Braddock for the last five years, and in that time, have become familiar with his work on communicative interventions to stem violent extremism. Related to this, he recently told me about his plans to submit a funding prospectus to the Department of Homeland Security. I have had the chance to review this prospectus, and as an end-user that could make use of the findings produced by the proposed work, I feel that both phases of Dr. Braddock's proposed project would be useful for my work on far-right disinformation in the United States. First, I would agree with Dr. Braddock's assertion that our knowledge base related to the role of disinformation in right-wing violent extremism is limited. His proposed Phase 1 activities, including the holding of a large-scale workshop of right-wing extremism experts and development of a database on right-wing attacks based on disinformation, would help guide Moonshot's activities in the right-wing extremism space. Both activities would build our understanding related to right-wing violent extremism in the United States, as well as how disinformation spread by various online actors helps propagate it. Given that Moonshot's activities center around having a detailed understanding the nature of the ideologies that we mean to counter, these kinds of activities would be invaluable for us and other stakeholders. moonshot Beyond this, Dr. Braddock (and his co-PI, Dr. John Horgan), also plan to evaluate inoculation as a potential communicative strategy for (1) turning budding right-wing extremists away from disinformation that might push them towards violence and (2) increasing the effectiveness of our own counter-messaging campaigns. I recognize inoculation's potential for protecting our targets from persuasion by right-wing extremist propaganda and in fact, have spoken with Dr. Braddock about using his work in our own programming. The work he proposes with Dr. Horgan would be an immensely useful first step down that path. Finally, I understand that Braddock and Horgan plan to develop tools for practitioners to translate their findings into counter-radicalization practice. Though this seems an obvious step, it is rare that researchers are focused on turning their findings into actionable guidance. What Braddock and Horgan propose here can do exactly that. In reviewing their proposal, they plan to develop exactly the kinds of guides that practitioners such as ourselves can use to best utilize the knowledge they produce in both phases of their work. Given the benefits that are likely to result from the work proposed by Braddock (as PI) and Horgan (as co-PI), I would vouch for their work. I would further recommend that the Department of Homeland Security consider funding the activities they propose, as they would have direct implications for practitioners who seek to mitigate the radicalizing potential of disinformation on potential right-wing violent extremists. If you would like to discuss Moonshot, the work proposed by Dr. Braddock, or how that work can influence our own efforts, please contact me at (b)(6) Yours sincerely (b)(6) moonshot Ross Frenett United States Department of State Washington, D.C. 20520 RE: Letter of Support from DOS/GEC for Dr. Braddock and Dr. Horgan Dear DHS Colleagues: My name is Adela Levis and I am the Academic & Think-Tank Liaison for the U.S. Department of State's Global Engagement Center (GEC). The GEC's mandate is to lead, coordinate and synchronize the U.S. Government's efforts to counter Violent Extremist and state-sponsored disinformation and propaganda. I have been in serving in this capacity throughout the fight against ISIS, and other jihadist inspired terrorist organizations, and have been driving the GEC's coordination with the Interagency, to promote a better understanding and countering of Racially and Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists' (REMVE) disinformation and propaganda. My work includes leading internal interagency discussions on the topic to deconflict and coordinate on available resources and gaps, and external engagements with a broad range of academics to fill knowledge gaps critical to USG needs. Currently, I lead an interagency effort to develop the Top 10 USG Research Questions on Countering Disinformation, in collaboration with DHS/CISA, DOD, USAID, FBI, USAGM, and NCTC \u2014 this effort includes REMVE as a key area of concern. It is in this capacity that I strongly support the funding proposal that Dr. Kurt Braddock intends to submit to the DHS's Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention Program. I recently had the opportunity to review the proposal and given the threat to domestic security posed by REMVE actors, as well as the proposal's focus on disinformation as a factor contributing to that threat: all three phases of the work proposed by Dr. Braddock (and his colleague, Dr. John Horgan) will be\u2014 both individually and collectively\u2014immensely useful for several agencies and organizations responsible for domestic security and our international interests. Dr. Braddock's practitioner-oriented thought leadership in this space has been shaping how the GEC and our Allies and Partners counter terrorist narratives; he has been providing pro bono advising services to the GEC to inform our counter-messaging efforts for three years, and much of the knowledge he has contributed has found its way into the GEC's strategic messaging campaigns, decision making, programs, and strategic planning. The proposed workshop, in the first phase of their project, would be instrumental to help us with defining the nature and extent of the REMVE threat currently facing U.S. domestic security, but would also aid in the framing of international efforts \u2014 especially given the multi-national nature of this phenomena, which touches on the needs of various USG Agencies. By bringing together researchers, government officials, security specialists, and former extremists, Braddock and Horgan will provide much needed insights to the DHS and other agencies seeking to prevent terrorism. The workshop will produce two key resources that we do not yet have. First, it will give us a comprehensive account of Racially and Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremism, their propaganda and disinformation, and how the two interrelate to form a specific violent threat. Second, Braddock and Horgan will provide stakeholders like the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security with ready access to a collection of experts who focus on different aspects of the REMVE threat \u2014 this is the type of multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary approach necessary to combatting this threat. United States Department of State Washington, D.C. 20520 Furthermore, I cannot overstate the importance of the applicants' plan to field test a specific communicative method, inoculation, as a strategy for preventing radicalization via REMVE disinformation and circumventing barriers to our own counter-messaging campaigns. Braddock has successfully tested inoculation on a smaller scale in the past and has counseled us on its potential to mitigate the effectiveness of terrorist propaganda. Using it in this capacity to prevent radicalization via REMVE disinformation has obvious benefits. Just as exciting, however, is the potential for inoculation to increase the effectiveness of our own counter-messaging campaigns. One of the perennial challenges with counter- messaging programs is resistance on the part of our targets. By field-testing inoculation as a means of preventing the anger and counter-arguing we encounter when we try to communicate with those we mean to protect from radicalization, Braddock and Horgan can provide an important tool for overcoming this obstacle. This application will be useful for all kinds of campaigns intended to prevent terrorism via counter-messaging, including those related to REMVE. And of course, the tools (guides, protocols, etc.) that Braddock and Horgan propose will be useful as well. It is critical for this kind of work to translate into usable instruments that guide our efforts. The third phase of the project (stemming from the first two phases) promises to do just that. Having reviewed the proposal, I believe that the DHS would do well to fund the work proposed by Drs. Braddock and Horgan. It will address a clear threat to U.S. domestic security, build our knowledge base about that threat, provide us with guidance on contending with it, and inform our practices moving forward. As a stakeholder who can use the outcomes associated with this project, I advocate its being funded. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions. Warm regards.
