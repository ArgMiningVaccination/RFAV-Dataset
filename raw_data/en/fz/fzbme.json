Today, society is reaping the rewards of investments in biomedi-cal research made over the past 50 years, which are leading to longer life, better health, more productiv-ity and lower healthcare costs. Over this time, medical innovation has dramatically reduced the cost of care and increased quality of life and economic well-being in a number of signi cant diseases\u2014polio, diabetes, heart disease, HIV and, in recent years, cancer. Among the technological advances of the twentieth century, medical innovation contributed more to our ability to live longer, healthier and more prosperous lives than any-thing else. Research shows a 96% decrease in death rate per thousand people and a 62% increase in life expectancy during the twentieth cen-tury, much of which can be attributed to medical innovation. Over the past 50 years, half of all economic growth can be attributed to advances in medical innovation that have reduced disability and dramatically increased productivity among people with long-term, but now manageable, diseases. Medical innovation is truly the greatest source of longer, better life and economic prosperity this world has ever known. In the twenty- rst century, it will continue to dra-matically improve health outcomes, reduce the overall cost of healthcare and stimulate growth of the global economy in ways never seen before. Thanks in part to Celgene, the two-year survival rate for patients with multiple myeloma has increased by 85% since the mid-1990s and chronic myeloid leukemia is now a long-term manageable disease. In the last 35 years, dramatic advancements in breast cancer have decreased mortality despite an increase in inci-dence. Over the past two decades, the incidence of lung cancer in men has steadily declined and is now starting to decline in women, and new strate-gies to treat pancreatic cancer show promise for the immediate future. This vision of the future, in which cancer is eradicated or controlled, is now within society's grasp. To make it happen, resources are required to develop more targeted cancer research for improved and more personalized prevention, diagnosis and treatment. What is required to make this vision for our future\u2014in which the most challenging diseases have been dramatically altered\u2014a reality? What will it take to deliver a world free from cancer? The answer can be found at the biopharmaceutical rm Celgene, whose corporate headquar-ters' main entrance is framed with fl ags that proclaim the delivery of a new life-enhancing cancer therapy, \"Discovered Here,\" \"Developed Here\" and \"Commercialized Here.\" These proclamations are elements of what Celgene calls the virtuous cycle of innovation, a process that requires continued commitment, investment and vision. For Celgene, it is more than a slogan; it is a restatement of the path this organization took as it moved from a fl edgling life science company to a global, preeminent biopharmaceutical innovator that has sustained revolutionary dis-coveries for a widening array of illnesses including cancer. Through medical innovation, the research community has made re-markable progress in helping cancer patients live longer, healthier lives. The cancer death rate has continued a decline that began in the 1990s. Over the past 50 years, half of all economic growth can be attributed to advances in medical innovation...

Science continues on the verge of breakthroughs to combat cancer, neurological disorders and many other diseases. The potential of science has never been greater and yet research and development investment, even in cancer, is declining. Conquering cancer and other diseases requires the ongoing dedication, passionate commitment and collaboration\u2014the collective intent\u2014of researchers, clinicians, innovators and entrepreneurs from industry, academia and govern-ments around the world. It requires a policy environment that fosters, values and supports the entire \"ecosystem of innovation\"\u2014including academic medical centers, voluntary health organizations, government agencies and biopharmaceutical industry scientists, entrepreneurs and investors.A policy environment that under- stands and supports the value of in-novation cannot be taken for granted. It is, in fact, very much at risk. When patients have access to innovative new treatments, health outcomes improve, and overall health system costs can be reduced, which posi-tively affects the economy. Medical science is accelerating at a rapid pace, fueled by technologies\u2014including genomics and proteomics, cell-based therapies, systems biology, nanotechnology and informatics\u2014that provide previously unimagined insights into molecular biology. This remarkable innovation has the potential to transform cancer from a leading cause of death to a long-term, manageable disease. We all envision a world in which serious diseases are prevented and once deadly diseases are either cured or treated as chronic, manageable conditions. Yet we are approaching a \"medical innovation cliff,\" a critical crossroads, where both the number of investments in medical innovation and the dollar value of those invest-ments are declining. A positive policy environment that supports continued investment in medical innovation is imperative to capitalize on the exciting opportunities that breakthroughs in science are now making possible. Within thirty years, medical inno- vation decreased the number of HIV-related deaths in the United States by 90%. Imagine that, by the year 2050, we could proclaim the same for patients with cancer. But rst, we need to develop effective, collabora-tive solutions that provide resources and maintain a robust ecosystem of innovation. By working together, we can once again change the course of human health and deliver a world free from cancer. -ROBERT GOLDBERG , Ph.D., cofounder & vice president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) is fo- cused on nding cures and improving the quality of life for blood cancer patients and their families. Recognizing that therapies were not getting to patients fast enough, in 2008, LLS initiated its Therapy Acceleration Program (TAP) forming venture philanthropy partnerships with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to help bridge the gap and advance innova-tive biomedical discoveries more quickly. In 2012, LLS unveiled the Targets, Leads & Candidates Program. The LLS partnership with Celgene Corporation is the rst in the program. Together, LLS and Celgene will identify and fund promising blood cancer research proj-ects. The collaboration leverages LLS's infrastructure for the identi cation and acceleration of innovative research at academic centers and Celgene's expertise in and com-mitment to developing innovative cancer therapies that help patients live longer, better lives. Celgene and LLS will also work together through LLS's Therapy Acceleration Program to overcome obstacles to drug development and further speed the development of novel blood cancer treatments. These partnerships are critical for blood cancer patients, as they have the potential to bring together the most innovative academic science and transform it more quickly into life-enhancing therapies through the global resources of biopharmaceutical companies. LLS supports the world's best and brightest academic researchers and awards grants based on merit to advance research addressing urgent, unmet needs. To date, LLS has invested more than $875 million in research. LLS research grants have funded many of the most promising breakthroughs, including targeted therapies and immuno-therapies. The impact of this investment is clear: Between 2000 and 2012, almost half of the cancer drugs newly approved by the FDA were developed rst to treat blood cancer patients. Many of these were advanced with funding from LLS and have now gone on to be used in the treatment of other cancers and diseases like rheumatoid arthritis. An explosion of innovative science, sustained research investment and the clinical successes of a new wave of targeted therapies are transforming the treatment land-scape of blood cancers. Thanks to research, survival rates for certain blood cancers have doubled, tripled and even quadrupled since 1960. Cures are the ultimate goal. LLS and Celgene continue to work toward the shared vision of a world without blood cancers. -LOUIS J.

Most of us know about one feature, the pharmaceutical industry's \"patent cliff, \" over which many blockbuster medicines, including the top-selling Lipitor, have tumbled from intellectual-property protection. In the cover section for our fifth year of Scientific American Worldview , we explore ongoing challenges in the drug industry, including another precipitous plunge\u2014the \"innovation cliff. \" Is the pharmaceutical industry heading for a drop in innovation? If so, what can be done to keep it on solid ground? Our team of talented writers explores some of the ongoing options, which range from drug discovery and regulatory changes to experimental teamwork between industry and academia. This year's issue also boasts the longest list of countries in our Scientific American Worldview Scorecard. As the numbers reveal, international competition in the biotechnology sector is fierce, and grows more so every year. Consequently, our Scorecard proves more valuable than ever in helping countries assess where they succeed and where they have room to improve. One of the world's greatest challenges\u2014hunger\u2014inspired this year's profiles section, which highlights three leaders in agricultural biotechnology. Plant virologist Rofina Y asmin Othman, at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lum-pur, mixed research and politics to enhance her country's capabilities. Adrian Dubock combined industry with philanthropy to battle malnutrition in nations that live largely on rice. And finally, Clive James utilized worldwide networks to develop a database of global biotechnology crops. As always, our Country Spotlights bring readers biotechnology stories from around the world, including a collaboration between Costa Rica and Spain, draught-resistant tea in Malawi, biotechnology meetings in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, and more. The need for collaborations, as described in some of our Spotlights, grows even more obvious in \"Making More from Math, \" a selection of articles that investigate the impact of data and analysis on today's biotechnology. Moreover, this section reveals another challenge of the biotechnology landscape\u2014the \"data cliff. \" Instead of peering down a perilous drop, as in the case of the innovation and patent cliffs, biotech experts stand at the base of the growing data cliff and wonder how to scale it. Our series of articles describes some of the most exciting attempts. Let us take a moment to express our gratitude for the support of our sponsors: Celgene, our Marquee Sponsor; AbbVie; Malaysian Biotechnology Corporation (BiotechCorp); PGT Healthcare; and Thailand Center of Excellence for Life Sciences (TCELS). Without them, we could not cover global life science innovation as rigorously as we do. Furthermore, Scientific American Worldview depends in every way on our Board of Advisers and the dedicated journalists around the world who help to create this publication.

In addition, the region still has large unmet medical needs, especially in diseases particularly prevalent in Asia, such as gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. Over the past ten years, Asia has moved toward a wider acceptance of foreign clinical data, increased promotion of drug devel-opment and structural and regulatory improvements.

Over the last few years, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) and Pharma-ceuticals and Medical De-vices Agency (PMDA) have made signi/f_i cant progress in driving innovation and evolving towards improved, stable processes/uni00A0with decreasing drug and device lag.

Additionally, countries such as Singapore are enjoy- ing signi/f_i cant government resources made available to strengthen R&D and are providing the structures and processes necessary for foreign companies to be successful. One example of this renewed R&D focus is Singapore's internationally recognized Singapore Gas-tric Cancer Consortium. As Northeast Asia's biopharmaceutical growth continues, it is impera-tive to harmonize and streamline regulatory policy amongst these Asian countries, and countries around the world, so that patients receive access \"As cultural and economic shifts continue to drive renewed awareness in biotech around the world, attention is shifting to Asia.\" \u2014ANNALISA JENKINSemerging options (2012, Scienti/f_i c American World-view , \"White Lightning\"). But whilst the way forward in technological and /f_i nan-cial terms seems relatively clear, for biosciences to be-come an engine for growth, two primary needs must /f_i rst be addressed: Mechanisms for ac- celerating collaboration. Since much of the demand for the products of a bio-economy will be from emerging and developing economies, the capac-ity to develop and deploy biotechnologies in these regions is essential. /T_h e global /f_l ow of technologies and knowledge on the scale required cannot happen without harmonization of regulations governing their development, di usion and deployment.

Science and society have become strangers and many technologies that would be the feedstock of a bio-economy have become the center of a polarized and fractious debate. /T_h e bio-technology industry and the yourVIEWS B_intro.indd 4 4/3/13 12:30 PMyourVIEWS 5 scientific community need to find ways to articulate the merits of a bio-economy as a vehicle for ensuring the provision of the global commons\u2014water, air and land\u2014and the protection of natural resource boundar-ies. Alliances between civil society, industry and the scientific community must be established, since we can no longer afford to continue the dialogues structured around vested interests and must focus instead on find-ing working solutions. There are grounds for optimism. The social com-petence and understanding that enable the transition to a bio-economy can be generated; in particular, the next phase of global development emerging in the United Nations's Post-2015 Development Agenda could provide the necessary high-level focus. But within this, and for new opinion leadership to emerge and find acceptance, there is a need for the creation of a space in which tensions can be defused around biotechnology and for a new collective understand-ing of the role of science in society to find life. \u00bb MIKE MAY (no relation to the editorial director) VP Public Affairs FuturaGeneS\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil +Ted Agres's \"White Lightning\" piece (2012, Scientific American World-view ) addressed one of the most exciting revolutions in manufacturing, indus-trial biotechnology. It will indeed explode in size over the next few years, driven in large part by advances being made in biology-based manufacturing technologies, such as gene synthesis. Innovations in high- accuracy, low-cost synthetic DNA fabrication tech-nologies can finally offer any number of industries a source of biologically derived building blocks in a manner that enables them to perform the high-throughput screen-ing needed to determine which genetic code makes for the most efficient en-zyme, the most robust crop strain or anything else they might imagine. The current limita- tions that have hobbled the growth of synthetic DNA as an engineering tool for many industrial applica-tions are finally being overcome. Using next-generation bio-fabrication platforms, R&D teams are now better able to predict what DNA sequences might work and test their functions faster and more reliably than ever before. That testing will sup-port the development of new materials, optimized enzymes, higher-efficiency biofuels and much more. Companies striving to design biofuels, for example, are already using DNA constructs to screen for pathways that optimize energy production and other components. Their success hinges on access to low-cost, high-throughput synthetic DNA. With bet-ter, more cost-effective and scalable DNA synthesis, industries ranging from agbio and enzyme manu-facturing to biofuels and specialty chemicals stand to make rapid and significant gains. Next-generation gene synthesis could prove to be as transformative for these and other multibillion-dollar industries as the semiconductor has been. \u00bb KEVIN MUNNELLY Chief Executive Officer Gen9Cambridge, Massachusetts THE DOUBLE BOTTOM LINE DANCE As a biotechnology start-up employing a creative mix of funding strategies, we read with interest \"Navigating The New Normal: Framing the critical strategic choices for life science firms today\" (2012, Scientific American Worldview ). Undoubtedly, the recent economic climate has produced challenges for even the most innova-tive companies to raise the necessary funding, through traditional means, and launch a successful biotech, which can run into tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. However, for companies with a double bottom line\u2014focusing on financial and social results\u2014alternative sources of capital are available to augment traditional approaches.PaxVax is such a double- bottom line company, devel-oping an oral platform that delivers innovative vaccines against infectious diseases in a socially responsible manner. We have raised more than $30 million in investment\u2014$20 million in government R&D revenue and $16 million in founda-tion debt financing plus a small amount of philan-thropy. All of our investors have an interest in both financial and social returns, but to varying degrees. Even charitable founda - tions want to ensure there is a sustain-able company that can de-liver results just as financial investors want to see some positive social returns. As a further novel fund- ing mechanism, we are also pursuing the award and subsequent sale of a Prior-ity Review Voucher (PRV). This government incentive, given for FDA approval of a therapy or vaccine against neglected tropical disease, grants the recipient priority review for another product that would not otherwise receive it and is worth po-tentially $50-300 million. PaxVax can develop vac-cines that qualify and then sell the subsequent vouch-ers to large pharmaceutical companies for cash to fund more vaccine development. We believe that in today's economic climate it B_intro.indd 5 4/3/13 8:59 PM6 LETTERS / OPINIONS / CRITIQUES is prudent to examine all av- enues to funding and capital efficiency, especially when it comes to public health. \u00bb KENNETH KELLEY Chief Executive Officer PaxVaxMenlo Park, California TALK ABOUT TWEETS In \"Tweeting For Tech- nology\" (2012, Scientific American Worldview ), Mike May took a good look at how biotech and pharma companies are trying to embrace mobile marketing and social networking tools to get their messages into the marketplace. One of the most significant barriers to adoption that he cited was the absence of clear govern-ment guidelines to enable industry to know precisely what they can and cannot do via the web. As pharma, bio- logic and medical device marketers look to social media as a means to create communities of patients and physicians with whom they can interact, their ac-tions may raise the concern of regulators. However, the FDA has provided only limited guidance on the proper use of social media despite citing social media guidance among the agency's top priorities.Despite public hearings and surveys, the FDA has only issued a single draft guidance to date that ad-dresses social media. That guidance really focused on off-label marketing and barely addressed the subject of social media. However, the guidance does cite the FDA 's examples of what it believes might be off-label violations through social media, includ-ing creating web addresses that would suggest off-label use, actively encouraging bloggers to write about off-label use and more. The previous guidance sheds some light on the ways in which the FDA may eventually regulate social media use by pharma, biotech and medical device manufacturers. The FDA will hold manufacturers responsible for their direct actions, as well as those of third parties. The FDA will monitor the implied mean- ing of content, as well as the direct meaning. Finally, the FDA will hold companies responsible for third party content even if it was unso-licited by the manufacturer. Companies must carefully and cautiously continue marketing their products with an informed social media strategy. To do nothing and wait for regulators to define the way on their own will only set a standard far too conserva-tive to be practical. In his article, Mike May also suggested (very appro-priately, I might add) that those individuals in biotech and pharma who are not currently using social media in their research and business activities should embrace a fundamental principle of Darwinism: adapt or face extinction. The same sage advice should be given to government regulators who remain slow to recognize that people communicate differently in the 21st century. \u00bb ERIK CLAUSEN Managing Partner Chempetitive GroupSan Diego, California +In ing (2012, Scientific American World-view ), he writes, \"The way we communicate today is vastly different from just a few decades ago. \" I sus-pect this comment seems obvious to most, but it is a good starting point when discussing social media, and specifically the reasons my company, a custom oligo- nucleotide and assay manu-facturer supporting biotech researchers, has for being active on social networks. First, we want to be good listeners. If a post doc at Northwestern University has success with quantita-tive PCR using our assays, and makes that known on Twitter, we want to be there to congratulate him or her. If a researcher expresses frustration with designing oligonucleotide primers, we want to reach out and offer advice. If a scientist at Y ale is frustrated with our online ordering process, we want to be able to walk him or her through it. Second, we want to be interesting. Not interesting to everybody on the planet, but interesting to those that have a passion for biology or science in general. We aim to do this by sharing and curating information that we hope is enlightening, educational, relevant, amus-ing, thoughtful, engaging. Third, we want to en- able. Specifically, we want to enable life science research-ers to perform the multitude of laboratory techniques and applications where our products could be used, such as PCR, qPCR, syn-thetic biology, mutagenesis and DNA sequencing. We accomplish this by shar - ing our own educational content, sharing educational material of others, and responding to technical questions posed directly to us on social networks. While we aim to do these three things, we remember some basic rules your mother probably taught you: Don't dominate the conversation; know when to be quiet; know when to speak up; know when to offer advice; and be respectful and helpful. \u00bb SEAN P.

Com- panies built upon rigorous scientific premises are intro-ducing concepts in diagnosis and treatment of diseases that were altogether unachievable just a decade ago. As these technologies are introduced, the com-munity has been challenged to clearly articulate their value proposition and\u2014to Goldberg's point\u2014define their cost relative to their value. A prime example of this can be found in the emergence of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), in which genomic sequencing technology is used to detect fetal abnormalities very early in a pregnancy (well before current methods) through a simple test of the mother's blood. In this case, the benefits of the technol-ogy offer vastly greater value for patients, who gain reliable information while avoiding the risks associated with current invasive tests. A critical barrier to the introduction of technolo-gies, like genomic sequenc-ing, has been recognition of the role the technology plays in the ever-improving quality of healthcare. Like other innovations, the NIPT space has been sub-ject to the struggle between the community and payers to adopt the technology in coverage programs. In terms of relative \"cost\" to current methods, the ad-vantage of providing highly accurate information, much faster, and without risk is undoubtedly a more ef-ficient and patient-friendly offering that has created significant value for the maternal-fetal community. An important consider- ation within this paradigm is the power of the patient voice. In the NIPT commu-nity, both patients and phy-sicians have been quick to adopt the technology, and have taken a leading role in advocating for their care in the interest of knowledge and convenience. As we see Moore's law in motion, who knows where diagnostic technologies could lead us in just a few years. \u00bb HARRY F. HIXSON, JR. Chairman and CEO SequenomSan Diego, California EATING AND THE EPIGENOME As Mike May pointed out in \"Calculating E. ColiContamination\" (2012, Scientific American World-view ) and increasing media headlines suggest, more must be done to address food safety issues. Fortu-nately, recent advances in biotechnology are opening new doors to managing outbreaks, which can cause loss of lives, serious health problems and significant financial burden to the food industry. Specifically, advances in new DNA sequencing technologies are providing exciting breakthroughs, as evidenced by the role of real-time sequencing to characterize the unusual strain that caused the deadly German E. coli outbreak. The gold standard for pathogen detection is a complete genome assembly. It is now possible to pro-duce a finished genome in a matter of hours of lab time and a few days or less of computational analysis. The availability of long-read sequencing technology allows the identification of full genes, genetic variants, structural variations and other virulence factors that could be missed with older techniques that required assembling the DNA frag-ments like a puzzle. As a result, the scientific com-munity can welcome a new kind of molecular epidemi-ology made possible with whole genome sequencing. Further, in the case of the German E. coli out - break, it was demonstrated that the \"epigenome\" (e.g., genomic methylation pat- terns) of this bacterium was impor-tant to its virulence. These base modifica-tions cannot be directly detected in methods that use PCR amplification, but can with one of the real-time sequencing. Quickly gener-ating high-quality refer-ence genomes of outbreak strains can then facilitate the development of highly specific, cost-effective as-says for testing purposes. Thus, while PCR-based methods can assist in response to food-contam-ination outbreaks, we are concerned that any efforts that do not examine the whole genome and epig-enome of a microorganism are missing an opportunity to reveal the full picture of information that may be critical to containing the outbreak. \u00bb JONAS KORLACH Chief Scientific Officer Pacific BiosciencesMenlo Park, California\"The gold standard pathogen detec-tion is genome assembly.\" \u2014JONAS KORLACH Think Asia, Invest ThailandAn Asian Hub, a World of Opportunity Globalized Business is a Race, Choose Your Lane Wisely.

BRIAIN DE BUITLIER: In consumer healthcare, the area where we operate, the main chal-lenge is helping consumers man-age the shift from what I would call \"managed\" care to self-care. There are three drivers: First, there is an increasing shift to self-care by many governments and other payers. Second, people are living longer and want more good years. It's a highly competitive world so we need to keep performing at our peak into our 60's and beyond. Third, there is a shift from treatment to prevention, which creates an increasing importance for health supplements and other products to help prevent illness and promote well-being. SAW: How did those issues contribute to the creation of PGT Healthcare? BDB: Both \"parent\" companies saw these trends and the growth poten-tial but at the same time realized that each could better compete and meet the needs of consumers in that changing environment by combining their strengths. P&G brings con-sumer insights and brand-building expertise\u2014the ability to communi-cate with consumers and establish brands that people trust. Teva brings the ability to produce a wide range of high-quality products. Plus, Teva Two Titans Team Up to Empower Healthcare Consumers supplies prescription drugs and OTC products, which means that it understands the total picture of what a pharmacist wants. We often talk about PGT Health- care as the \"child\" of two impressive \"parents.\" Our DNA is a combination of our parents' DNA. The challenge for PGT Healthcare is pulling the best from P&G and Teva. SAW: Why focus on over-the-counter drugs? BDB: That was natural intersec- tion point of Teva products and P&G's consumer focus. Teva brings a wide range of product expertise, but was weaker on the consumer side. P&G brings deep consumer understand-ing. So, this makes a strong partner-ship for OTC products. SAW: What regions will be the market focus of PGT Healthcare and why? BDB: I wouldn't say regions, because we are focused on key countries in every region\u2014ones that combine high growth potential and where one of the parent compa-nies already has strong capabilities and a deep understanding of the regulatory environment and market. You need that understanding. The regulatory environment alone is quite different country by country. Even in Europe, where there's some uniformity, each country has its own regulatory and marketing nuances. Outside of Europe, regulatory differ-ences are even more complex. P&G and Teva bring comple- mentary geographical strengths. In Latin American, for example, P&G is strong in Brazil and Mexico, and Teva is strong in Venezuela, Peru and Chile. Similar complementary strengths exist in Europe and Asia. That makes P&G and Teva very good at piecing together a jigsaw puzzle from a geographic point of view. Q&A WITH CEO OF PGT HEALTHCARE, BRIAIN DE BUITLIER \"/T_h e approach we're taking is to deliberately build in the /f_l exibility to evolve so that we can continue to meet the ever-evolving needs of people around the world. \" \u2014BRIAIN DE BUITLIERIn November 2011, the Procter & Gamble Company (Cincinnati, OH) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (Jerusalem, Israel) teamed up in a joint venture called PGT Healthcare, which is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. This represents a new model that combines development and commercialization skills in the market for over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. CEO Briain de Buitlier (pictured right) made time to share his perspective about this novel venture with editorial director Mike May. B_intro.indd 10 4/3/13 12:00 AMSAW: How would you describe the status of PGT Healthcare? BDB: PGT Healthcare is a child beginning to walk, with two proud, con dent parents encouraging its every step. We've accelerated our growth every quarter so far\u2014an unusual feat for any joint venture\u2014but the even bigger success in my opinion is how we're laying the foun-dation for the future. We are creating a unique way of working that draws the best from both parents, aligning the parent companies on a common strategy and approach. With a very strong leadership team\u2014built from strong leaders from both parent companies\u2014we are optimistic about tomorrow.SAW: Do you hope to expand this venture to additional partners? BDB: We de nitively want and expect additional partnerships. With so much innovation and complexity in the health-care market, there are many people out there doing interesting things that we could bring to the market in more powerful ways. PGT Healthcare is \"open for business.\" We are eager to hear from anyone who has a novel OTC product, innovative packaging solution or technology or service to improve our manufacturing and go-to-market ca-pabilities. We're especially interested in the respiratory, digestive wellness and vitamin, mineral and supplements categories but are open to opportunities in many other self-care categories.SAW: In the future, how do you see PGT Healthcare providing for the changing needs of patients around the world? BDB: The approach we're taking is to deliberately build in the flexibility to evolve so that we can continue to meet the ever-evolving needs of people around the world. We call our consumers \"people,\" not pa-tients. That comes back to the start of our discussion about prevention and wellness. We work hard to understand what people want and need, and then we find out how we can deliver that. That is really at the heart of what we do. PGT Healthcare employees work together at their Geneva-based o ces.

With few new mega blockbusters in sight to /f_i ll the lost revenue, many experts say that the sector needs a new business model to stay a/f_l oat. \"Some pharma companies, they've clearly gotten too fat, too big, too ine cient, and they waste an enormous amount of money and resources,\" says Steve Arlington, global advisory leader for pharmaceutical and life sci-ences at the consulting /f_i rm PwC. Others agree. For in-stance, Steven Burrill, chief executive o cer of Burrill and Company, a San Francisco-based /f_i nancial services /f_i rm focused on the life sciences industry, says, \"/T_h e question quite frankly is: Can these dinosaurs change fast enough before they become extinct?\" Pharma 's NEXT BIG MOVE EXPANDING OFFERINGS Pharmaceutical companies are trying to change. In recent years, the industry has begun the formidable task of unrav-eling its traditional operational models. Drug makers have moved away from long-standing systems of vertical integra-tion, in which all the steps of drug development and com-mercialization occur in-house, and toward a structure that focuses more heavily on deal-making, alliances, sales and Can top-to-bottom changes save the industry? BY ELIE DOLGIN C_report.indd MODEL 13global marketing. \"Big pharma of the future will look a little bit more like Walmart,\" says Burrill. These companies will be in the sales and distribution business, outsourcing innova - tion, development and manufacturing, he says. \"That's a very, very different pharma model than the one we have today.\" In this new landscape, the emerging markets\u2014Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and Turkey\u2014could offer the biggest growth opportunities. Although the profit margins in these countries might be slimmer than they've been historically in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the rising incidence of chronic conditions in the developing world provides a massive problem in need of a pharmaceu - tical solution. Additionally, running clinical trials in such locales can help bring down costs, as this phase of the drug-development process is one of the most expensive. Drug companies are also moving to provide total healthcare packages, offering products such as diagnostic tests and developing services that increase ac - cess and adherence to prescription drugs. \"Healthcare is no longer just about providing a drug,\" says Andy Plump, deputy head of research and translational medicine at the French drug giant Sanofi. \"It's about providing a medicine that offers a healthcare solution.\" FROM SECRETIVE TO SHARING Still, basic research and translational science remain para - mount. \"That's where the answers are going to come from,\" says Stewart Lyman, a Seattle-based consultant for the bio - technology and pharmaceutical sectors. But how can the research process be improved? Most major players in the industry have started to carve up their sprawling internal research operations into smaller and nimbler teams focused on specific therapeutic areas. They've also forged collaborations with academic research groups to bolster early drug discovery efforts and established licensing deals with smaller outfits to replen - ish thinning pipelines. Most unprecedented, the industry is now collaborating in the early stages of research and de - velopment to learn from each other's mistakes, and hope - fully cut costs. Last year, for example, ten major pharma - ceutical companies launched TransCelerate BioPharma, a nonprofit organization dedicated to solving common chal - lenges encountered during the clinical-trial process. \"The willingness to share information now is unlike anything I have seen in my 30 years of working in this field,\" says Kenneth Kaitin, director of the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development in Boston. \"I still am amazed when you hear a company say, 'Here's what we tried, here's the buy-in we got, here's how much it cost and here's why it failed.' That's something companies never used to talk about.\" In addition, the pharmaceutical sector is changing its approach to product development. Instead of develop - ing therapies for the masses, drug companies are pursu - ing medicines that treat smaller patient populations, but which are priced high enough to be hugely profitable. That trend came to the forefront last year when Hu - mira (adalimumab), an antibody drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other specialized immunologi - cal conditions, unseated the cholesterol-lowering agent Lipitor (atorvastatin) as the best-selling medicine in the world. In 2012, nearly half of the drugs approved by U.S. regulators also had orphan-drug designation, mean - ing they were in - tended to treat dis - eases affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the country. Many of these were targeted at specific forms of cancer, underscoring the big investments being made in genet - ics-driven personalized therapies. \"These have become the new blockbusters,\" Kaitin says. SUNNY SKIES AHEAD? Some experts believe the worst is over. \"I would argue with those who say the industry is broken, and I would reframe the argument to say the industry has gone through a ten-year period of turmoil that it's now coming out of,\" says John LaMattina, a senior partner at PureTech Ventures in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who previously led Pfizer's global research and development efforts. He points to in - creasing numbers of new medicines approved in the Unit - ed States: 30 in 2011 and 39 in 2012. Throughout the previ-ous decade, the number usually hovered in the low 20s. \"We are on an upswing for the industry,\" says Paul Stoffels, chief scientific officer and worldwide chairman of pharmaceuticals at Johnson & Johnson, in New Brunswick, New Jersey. \"We're getting significantly better at everything we do\u2014significantly faster, significantly cheaper, signifi - cantly more efficient. And that's in all aspects: innovation, development, regulatory submissions, getting approvals, getting products launched and getting drugs paid for.\" And while the challenges ahead are significant as well, LaMattina remains optimistic. \"Is it harder to do? Yes. Is it more expensive to do? Absolutely. But there are still a lot of diseases that need treatments and a lot of opportunities out there for good drugs,\" he says. \"The industry has come out of some dark periods, but for the next few years, I think it's in pretty good shape.\" Some pharma companies, they 've clearly gotten too fat, too big, too inefficient, and they waste an enormous amount of money and resources. \u2014Steve Arlington C_report.indd 13 PHARMA'S NEW MODEL 15 The roughly $1 bil - lion cost of devel - oping a new drug presents a financial hurdle to pharma - ceutical companies large and small. It not only prevents big pharma from investing in more drugs, but it also blocks many small innovators from entering the market at all. Which is why the success of Zhejiang Beta Pharma in develop - ing China's first cancer drug, with an investment that seems miniscule by Western standards, is creating such a stir worldwide. Beta Pharma's icotinib, marketed under the name Conmana, was ap - proved by China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) in June 2011. Some consider its development as a new benchmark, changing the way China's pharmaceutical com - panies and multinationals envision developing innovative drugs. In this young industry\u2014China's SFDA was only founded in 1998, and ten years ago many Chinese biotechnology firms existed only as dreams in the minds of their founders\u2014experts look to the regulatory and commercial success of icotinib as the precursor to a shift in the industry.The cost-cutting success of one Chinese startup makes the industry sit up and take notice BY REBECCA KANTHOR BETA PHARMA'S BUZZ So what's all the buzz about Beta Pharma? According to many industry experts, icotinib hit that sweet spot of low development costs, speedy ap - proval and a high rate of return. \"The rumors are that it will make $100 million in sales this year,\" says John Oyler, founder and CEO of BeiGene, a Beijing-based pharmaceu - tical company that is another one of China's startups to watch. \"It's a small molecule drug, so it will probably be pretty profitable, and that's just in China.\" He estimates Beta Pharma's investment in the drug to be between $20 and $30 million. \"In the U.S., you can't invest a couple million dollars into a company and ever even think about getting a drug,\" he says. \"In the U.S., people would be talking about hundreds of millions of dollars, not tens of millions of dollars.\" In addition, icotinib went from early development to market launch in only eight years\u2014faster than the typical ten years in the United States. BEHIND BETA PHARMA In 2003, three Chinese physicians\u2014returnees educated in the U.S.\u2014launched Beta Pharma. Cofounder Yinxiang Wang had considered devel - oping an anti-cancer drug in the U.S., but he couldn't raise U.S. venture cap - ital. Consequently, they moved back to China, where their networks were more established.STAR C_report.indd 15 4/2/13 4:35 PM16 Illustrations profile of Beta Pharma, Phar - mAsia News reported how CEO Yinxiang Wang told pharmaceutical professionals in Philadelphia last year that he saw an opportunity in China a decade ago, when few were doing in - novative research. \"Patients need in - novative drugs, but very few can afford them,\" he said. \"So we started thinking about the idea\u2014the me-too strategy. It is not complicated.\" When Wang re - turned to China, he found an investor in his friend Lieming Ding, a fellow physi - cian returnee who also dabbled in real estate and is now company president. The drug that they developed, icotinib, is a mouthful of a molecule: an epidermal growth factor recep - tor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The fact that it could be used to treat non-small cell lung cancer, a growing disease in the Chinese population, was key to its developers. Icotinib is actually a refor and Roche's Tarceva (erlotinib). Although its structural similarity to these drugs puts it in the \"me-too\" category, its unique structure makes it a new chemical entity\u2014one with the distinction of having been developed and tested on Chinese patients. While the company's total in - vestment in icotinib has only been rumored, the founders have acknowl - edged in interviews that costs were much lower than if they'd developed icotinib in the U.S. or even if they were a multinational developing the drug in China. Still, the costs were difficult for the small startup to cover. One of the biggest expenses was the phase III clinical trial, for which Beta Pharma secured loans from banks and local government of roughly $9.5 million to provide Conmana and competitor Iressa to more than 500 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Even in China, finding investors remained difficult. The company hit a snag when VCs who had expressed interest pulled out in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. When Beta Pharma completed phase III trials, however, it managed to strike a deal with Lilly Asia Ventures, Eli Lilly and Co.'s China fund, which had been fol - lowing the company but was waiting to invest in order to minimize risk. In an interview with PharmAsia News , Lilly Asia Ventures's managing direc - tor Yi Shi explained the rationale for his caution, saying, \"From over 100 projections [for various companies] I received 4-5 years ago, only one com - pany exceeded its projection\u2014that is Beta Pharma.\" PRODUCING A POSTER CHILD Certainly, government support smoothed the approval process of icotinib. In the PharmAsia News in- terview, Wang said that continual dialogue with the SFDA helped them move along the regulatory approval process and secure fast-track status, part of a system that the SFDA only finalized in 2009. Although most clin - ical-trial authorizations take 12-18 months in China, icotinib was cleared for clinical trials in only six. The government saw Beta Pharma as a poster child for the innovation that it hopes to foster. The drug was included as part of China's \"Signifi - cant Innovative Drug Development\" program to promote growth in the pharmaceutical industry. At Con - mana's official launch in August of 2011, in Beijing's Great Hall of the People\u2014the cavernous auditorium that hosts China's annual parlia - ment meetings\u2014officials called the discovery of icotinib a breakthrough, comparing its significance to China's development of bomb- and satellite-technology capabilities in the 1960s. For the SFDA, concerned with en - suring the safety of 1.3 billion people, icotinib was a per - fect drug to hold up as an example. \"Truthfully, I don't think the SFDA would have let some - thing through that was dramatically new,\" says Oyler. \"This [compound was] better understood, so likely it is safer. But it is a great beginning, a great start, and people should be very excited about it.\" Government support and the regulatory fast track helped Beta Pharma get icotinib on the market. \"Beta Pharma's example shows that it helps to be a Chinese company based in China,\" says Howard Liang, man - aging director of biotech research at Leerink Swann, a healthcare invest - ment bank headquartered in Boston. \"It is like having a special green chan - nel when we go through customs at the airport.\" Lilly Asia Ventures's Yi Shi took a risk that Chinese patients, who usu - ally cannot afford imported drugs, would flock to Conmana. As he told PharmAsia News, \"The thinking is that if something is as good as Iressa and Tarceva and has a lower price point, then you will open up a huge market that is China.\" So far it looks like he was right. In its first seven months on the market, sales of icotinib surpassed $16 mil - lion. People were definitely paying attention, even though the drug has yet to be reimbursed under China's government health insurance. As a lo - cally produced drug, icotinib sells in The government saw Beta Pharma as a poster child for the innovation that it hopes to foster. C_report.indd 16 4/2/13 4:30 PM PHARMA'S NEW MODEL 17China for a reported two-thirds of the price of its imported counterparts. Nonetheless, icotinib must be taken three times a day, while its predeces-sors only require once-a-day dosage. A/f_t er patients have used icotinib for six months, though, Beta Pharma of-fers them the drug for free for the rest of their lives. By 2016, sales are pro-jected to reach $160 million. With icotinib set to generate ten times its development cost in sales, experts wonder if this represents a new model of drug development for Chinese companies. PROSPECTS FOR BETTER PATIENT POPULATIONS What makes Beta Pharma work? /T_h e company's millions of dollars spent developing icotinib sound like pen-nies in the pharmaceutical industry. Ben Cavender, associate principal with China Market Research Group, a stra-tegic market intelligence /f_i rm head-quartered in Shanghai, argues that drug development in China is much more cost e ective. \"Con-ducting both R&D and testing in China makes sense, as drug companies have a relatively large pool of well-trained scientists willing to work for wages that are substantially lower than in the U.S. or Europe, as well as a large number of patients on which to run drug trials,\" he says. \"/T_h is combi-nation allows the process to go much faster and keeps costs down.\" Beyond low costs, Oyler points out that China o ers more access to /f_i rst-line patients\u2014ones who have not tried another treatment. \"Treating a /f_i rst-line patient doesn't have all the com-plications that you have with someone who's been on another therapy. /T_h e other therapy may have toxicity that trails into your study.\" He also notes, \"You're getting patients that are much sicker, because they are further along in the progression of their disease.\"Although China's healthcare mar- ket is growing, companies like Beta Pharma that get novel drugs approved in China still have to get approval in Western markets to distribute glob-ally. \"Inability to sell in Western mar-kets will continue to be a weakness, because innovative drug development involves expensive R&D and clinical testing,\" says Eric Langer, partner at BioPlan Associates in Rockville, Maryland. \"Until China matches Western standards for trials, and even manufacturing, this will continue to slow international market development for Chinese bio/pharma companies.\" CHINA-BASED CONNECTIONS ARE KEY Still, Beta Pharma's story has energized China's biotechnology and pharma-ceutical industries. \"/T_h e single biggest thing is there is a clinical path with /f_i rst-line patients for a novel chemical entity to get approved in China, and that can be done in a time-e cient matter,\" says Oyler. \"I think that just validates what a lot of people are trying to do.\" Analysts say that multi-nationals are paying attention to the advantag-es that come with working in China. \"We'll likely see foreign pharmaceu-tical companies continue to invest in China-based R&D centers,\" says Cav-ender. \"Quite likely, [we] will see in-creased cooperation with local /f_i rms, as those /f_i rms may o/f_t en understand the government approval process or have access to government backing or support that would otherwise be di cult to get.\" Other experts see the attraction to China as well. \"U.S. and global pharmaceutical companies have been cutting R&D, but almost all of them are building up their R&D centers in Shanghai or Beijing, says Li-ang. \"So there is a natural migra-tion of Chinese scientists and re- searchers from the West to China as a result. It's a lot easier to get money to invest in emerging markets like Chi-na. I think it will be inevitable that talent will follow money.\" /T_h e SFDA also plays a fundamen- tal role. \"We have all the advantages of the cost structure here, the regula-tory clinical path that Beta Pharma just used,\" says Oyler. \"It's an unbe-lievable situation to be in and largely people don't understand that. What you'll see in a /f_i ve-year period is lots of novel drugs that are in clinical tri-als that are of interest, not just for China but from a global perspective, because they do have the potential to be a best-in-class drug.\" AWAITING AN IPO Icotinib's lone approval in China keeps it under the radar abroad. \"I don't believe that the Beta Pharma story is widely understood and known at this point by the industry broadly,\" says Oyler. \"It has the intention to go public in China. If it was in the U.S., it would go public already.\" /T_h e IPO (initial public o ering) process is slower in China and a company has to be pro/f_i table for three years before going public. Whatever the future holds for Beta Pharma, its story thus far may offer a blueprint for other compa-nies\u2014both within and without Chi-na's borders\u2014for success in today's pharma marketplace.BGI in Shenzhen leads the world in sequencing capacity (see page 88).

C_report.indd 17 4/2/13 4:29 PM18 Illustrations by FRANCESCO BONGIORNI The BRAVE NEW WORLD of BIOSIMILARS Drug agencies around the world struggle to find safe and effective pathways to bring follow-on biologics to market BY PMThe promise of biopharmaceuti - cals\u2014a new generation of more potent medicines with fewer side effects\u2014accounts for the tremen - dous surge in their production around the world. But like any new generation, they come with their own set of complexities that could undermine that promise if not addressed with care and at - tention. The unique properties of these drugs, composed of proteins or nucleic acids, pres - ent even more challenges after their patents expire. At that point, other companies will seek to replicate their compli - cated nature to create comparable versions of them, drugs known as biosimilars or follow-on biologics. \"It's a new field,\" says Alasdair Breckenridge, former chair of the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The global market now includes some 168 biologics\u2014 insulin, antibodies and other therapeutic proteins culti - vated in living cells\u2014that target more than 250 diseases. Their growing use marks a shift away from chemically synthesized small-molecule drugs, like aspirin, which companies can easily translate into generics. The same can - not be said for bi - ologics. \"Even if biosimilars look the same on pa - per as the parent drug, they may not act the same in the human body,\" says Roger Stark, a healthcare-policy analyst at the Washington Policy Center. \"They're not the same.\" The processes required to generate these biosimilars are costly and difficult to replicate, creating numerous hurdles for manufacturers hoping to bring them to market. Regulators are scrambling to create rules that will allow biosimilars on the market without compromising patient safety or clinical effectiveness. CAUSES OF COMPLEXITY Biologics have already transformed HIV, certain cancers and other serious illnesses into treatable conditions. As scientists delve deeper in explorations of the human ge - nome and personal medicine, the marketplace can expect a flood of new biologics that will target many other life-threatening illnesses. Nonetheless, the complex configu - ration of biologics\u2014with active ingredients composed of intricately structured molecules consisting of tens of thou - sands of atoms\u2014makes them impossible to replicate exactly. The biological origin of biologics means that even mi - nor differences in manufacturing can alter a drug's effec - tiveness or lead to major changes in patient outcomes. \"The process is as important as the product,\" says Peter Pitts, president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest and a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) associate commissioner. \"So it isn't just the discovery of the molecule that's important. It's the ability to make the molecule and then reproduce it on a regular basis.\" The FDA has yet to approve a single biosimilar. By con - trast, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has already approved 15 biosimilar drugs (with two of those since with - drawn by the manufacturers before they hit the market). A \"large number\" are currently in the pipeline, accord - ing to Brecken - ridge. Nearly all are new versions of biologics are relatively small in size, such as so - matropin (human growth hormone) and epoetin alfa (a red blood cell production stimulator). A provision of President Obama's healthcare reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), specifically addressed regulation of biosimilars. That pro - vision, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA), empowered the FDA to license prod - ucts that are similar to or interchangeable with an already established biological treatment. It also laid out some basic Regulators are scrambling to create rules that will allow biosimilars on the market without compromising patient safety or clinical effectiveness. C_report.indd 19 4/10/13 7:23 AM20 Illustrations by FRANCESCO BONGIORNI guidelines the thornier considerations: how to prove biosimilarity. /T_h e bill states that a new biosimilar drug must be \"highly similar\" without \"clinically mean-ingful di erences\" in terms of safety, purity and potency and must use \"the same mechanism\" to treat a disease. /T_h e bill also requires manufacturer proof that the new drug su ciently replicates the existing biologic product, both in terms of structure and clinical results, gained through some combination of analytical, animal and clinical stud-ies. /T_h at proof, however, might require 80-90 percent of the testing needed for the parent drug, notes Stark. REASONING FOR NEW RULES /T_h e BPCIA leaves many issues for the FDA to resolve, in-cluding standards for interchangeability with the original drug, and the type and amount of data needed for each individual biosimilar applicant. /T_h e agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research is working to establish an appropriate regulatory pathway, just as the EMA's Com-mittee for Medicinal Products for Human Use did back in 2005. As explained by Joseph Damond, senior vice presi-dent for international a airs at the Washington, D.C.-based Biotechnology Industry Organization, \"Instead of setting a one-size-/f_i ts-all set of requirements in terms of how many clinical trials are needed, they're going to look at the 'totality of evidence' for each case in terms of what the requirements will be.\" /T_h is approach follows Europe's lead on the regulatory front in utilizing a variety of sources to collect data, in-dicating that the United States will determine testing re-quirements for biosimilars on a case-by-case basis. Preliminary guidelines were released in February 2012, but in August the FDA acknowledged that the process was moving slowly and is far from over. Damond expects that regulations will need to go through several dra/f_t s. \"I be-lieve they've got a framework set, but the speci/f_i cs of what the process is going to be are still being worked out,\" he says. It's not the /f_i rst time that new pharmaceutical alterna- tives have prompted new rules. Generics\u2014follow-on ver-sions of small-molecule drugs\u2014were granted a stream-lined approval pathway, distinct from innovator drugs, with the passing of the Drug Price Competition and Pat-ent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. /T_h e bill gave key concessions to originator companies, extending pharmaceutical patents for /f_i ve years and guaranteeing a minimum of /f_i ve years market exclusivity in exchange for shortening generics' march to approval. Like Hatch-Waxman, BPCIA gave some strong con- cessions to innovator companies. For example, companies were granted 12 years of data exclusivity following FDA licensing of a product\u2014a tradeo for the pathway that will cut the time biosimilars wait to enter public use. Uganda leads African countries in HIV-related publications (see page 61). CURVES IN THE ROAD /T_h e Obama administration, however, included a provision in the 2013 federal budget that would cut innovator data exclusivity from 12 years to seven. /T_h e proposal hopes to expedite competition for consumers. Some experts claim that seven years isn't enough time to recoup R&D invest-ments and will kill the incentive for companies to /f_i nd treatments for anything other than major health prob-lems. With a seven-year cap, \"will there even be a biosimi-lar industry?\" asks Stark. Another BPCIA provision has long-term legal impli- cations. Biosimilar applicants must provide the innovator company with the application and \"other information that describes the process or processes used to manufacture the biological product\" within 20 days of acceptance for review by the FDA. /T_h e originator may then respond with a list of possible patent infringements. If acceptable deals can't be brokered, the innovator may sue to gain compensation for some of those patents. Since the healthcare-reform legisla-tion does not require that legal battles be resolved before approval, lawsuits could theoretically drag on for years af-ter a biosimilar hits the market. /T_h e fear of lawsuits could fuel the creation of so-called biobetters\u2014biologics that are a step better than the origi-nator drug. \"[A biobetter] isn't necessarily a straight bio-similar, but a biologic copy that, for example, needs to be taken on a less frequent basis or has fewer side e ects. So it has actually improved the molecule,\" says Pitts. Biobetters step beyond structural imitation to incorpo- rate molecular or chemical modi/f_i cations that may length-en half-life, lower dosing frequency or increase potency. /T_h e European regulatory approach is di erent in three key ways. First, Europe grants a ten-year product exclusiv-ity period, compared with the U.S.'s current 12 years. Sec-ondly, Europe has strict \"pharmacovigilance\" guidelines to track drug safety throughout the life of a product. Pro-posed U.S. guidelines are less speci/f_i c about follow-up, says Breckenridge. Dra/f_t FDA regulations state that manufac-turers might be required to continue monitoring the medi-cal results of their products a/f_t er they enter the market. If the FDA feels that possible safety risks require additional data, they have the right to demand post-market studies. Last is the issue of how a biosimilar is de/f_i ned. /T_h ese complex proteins cannot be de/f_i ned as precisely as the C_report.indd 20 4/2/13 3:31 PM PHARMA'S NEW MODEL 21 simpler small-molecule drugs. \"The FDA has wanted to have a higher degree of precision between the reference compound and the biosimilar,\" says Breckenridge. But he adds that the U.S. and Europe are trying to do the same thing. \"We're doing it, as we often do, by slightly differ - ent methods,\" he says. \"But the aims are exactly the same: to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of this important new group of medicines.\" GOING FOR GLOBAL GUIDELINES The Japanese government recently established biosimilar guidelines that essentially follow the EU Framework Pro - gramme. Moreover, it is expected that the EMA\u2014with nearly a decade of regulatory experience with biosimilars under its belt\u2014and the FDA will set global standards for regulation of these drugs. Multinational producers will re - quire their products to adhere to these standards in order to be competitive in these huge markets. But elsewhere, in emerging markets such as China, India, Brazil and Mexico, where cost is a major factor in the abil - ity to treat patients, there is a more complex negotiation between safety and access. They generally set a lower bar in terms of regulation and clinical-trial requirements. Asia\u2014India, China and Korea in particular\u2014has a competitive advantage in the production of biosimilars because of low costs. But as biosimilars become big busi - ness, the region could be in for a difficult growth process if it does not tighten its rules. \"If you have a different regula - tory level than, say, the FDA or the EMA, which will have pretty high levels, you may be able to create a space for your local producers,\" says Damond. However, he adds, \"In terms of economics, there's going to be a price to be paid, because they may not be globally compliant.\" With plans to become a leading biosimilars producer, South Korea is expanding its world-class production infra - structure, building research and development capabilities and recruiting bio-specialized workers. India also aims to manufacture numerous biosimilars. Although the country just released draft regulatory guide - lines for biosimilars last June, the Central Drugs Stan - dard Control Organization has approved over 20 \"similar biologics\" in the domestic marketplace. The first of these drugs was Wockhardt's Biovac-B, a hepatitis B vaccine that came out in 2000. In China, which also lacks specific regulatory rules, biosimilars have been available since 1989. To date, more than 300 biosimilar drugs flood the market. The China State Food and Drug Administration announced in 2012 that it was crafting its first set of regulations in consulta - tion with the FDA and EMA. The complexity of manufacturing and high R&D price tag for biopharmaceutical treatments means that multinational companies will be the big players, among them R&D-based pharma, generics manufacturers and biotechnology companies. Over the next few years, some top-selling biologics\u2014including the breast cancer drug Herceptin\u2014will lose product patent protection, offering lucrative possibilities for many in the industry. TEAMING UP FOR TOMORROW Competition among drug makers is likely to yield better and cheaper medicines once biosimilars become widely available, with multinational companies jockeying for position and creating partnerships to work on certain products. Ameri - can pharmaceuti - cal giant Mylan has partnered with Bio - con, India's premier biotech firm, to sell Indian-made bio - similars for a wave of biologic patents that expire in 2015. Merck Serono, the Swiss affiliate of Germany's Merck KGaA, is working with another Indian company, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, to de - velop a portfolio of biosimilar cancer drugs. And Merck has partnered with South Korea's Hanwha Chemical to develop and commercialize a biosimilar version of Enbrel, a popular arthritis medicine. Biopharm treatments can be expensive. A 2009 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine (Engelberg, A.B. et al. 361, 1917-1919) estimated that the annual cost for pa - tients taking biologic drugs may range anywhere between $8,447 (for Epogen, which treats chronic anemia caused by kidney disease) to $200,000 (for Cerezyme, which is prescribed for type 1 Gaucher disease). Yearly treatment with many of the drugs profiled in this study ranged from $25,000 to more than $56,000. \"The cost of healthcare is on everyone's mind, so that's an issue,\" says Stark. Ultimately, even though biosimilars will give consum - ers an alternative to the original treatment, price cuts will be fairly limited. Based on the European experience, Pitts estimates that the cost will be 20-30 percent less than the innovator product\u2014far more expensive than generics, which are priced 70-80 percent below the original drug. A new day in pharmaceutical medicine is upon us, and the benefits to millions will be profound. However, as Breckenridge points out, \"We don't know everything about every biopharmaceutical. There may well be fresh problems coming up with new ones. And we're going to have to deal with them as they come about.\"Ultimately, even though biosimilars will give consumers an alternative to the original treatment, price cuts will be fairly limited. C_report.indd 21 4/2/13 3:30 PM22 NEW MODEL 23Innovative therapies won't reach the patients that need them unless drug regulators learn to innovate as well BY CASSANDRA WILLYARD In a YouTube video posted in April 2012, Darlene Gant, a mom with stage IV breast cancer and a liver riddled with tumors, lies in bed and pleads. Her voice cracking, Gant begs for ac - cess to a cancer drug that, at that time, hadn't yet been approved. Her frustration with the slow pace of drug approvals is pal - pable. \"We're just watching so many women die,\" she says. \"The trials are concluded. All the data is there.\" Yet the drug is just \"sitting in limbo.\" Gant's plea is heart wrenching. Yet others worry that regulators might be approving medicines too quickly, before they fully understand the risks. For example, evidence that the diabetes drug Avandia increases the risk of heart attack and stroke prompted drug regulators to severely restrict its access more than a decade after it was fast-tracked for approval. Margaret Hamburg, commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administra - tion (FDA), and former deputy com - missioner Joshua Sharfstein addressed this issue in a 2009 New England Journal of Medicine article (Ham - burg, M.A. & Sharfstein, J.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 360, 2493-2495). \"In the do - main of medical products, it has been said that the FDA has just two speeds of approval\u2014too fast and too slow,\" they wrote. \"Critics concerned about haste point out, accurately, that drugs and other products are generally ap - proved on the basis of relatively small studies and that safety problems often emerge when large populations are exposed to the products. Those wor - ried about delay note, correctly, that people with life-threatening diseases have no time to wait.\" Today's drug researchers ben - efit from unprecedented advances in technology. Powerful new tools en - able scientists to quickly sequence whole genomes, monitor changes in proteins and metabolites, and much more. Still, the rate of new drug ap - plications and new drug approvals has remained relatively flat. Mean - while, the cost of drug development has skyrocketed. There is a need for \"innovation in regulation to match the kind of innovation we're seeing in discovery and development of these new medical products,\" says Andrew von Eschenbach, former commis - sioner of the FDA and current presi - dent of Samaritan Health Initiatives, a healthcare policy consulting firm in Montgomery, Texas. To deal with these challenges, reg - ulatory agencies like the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) are rethinking their approach to drug regulation, searching for new ways to speed access to the most needed drugs, increase the efficiency of drug development and ensure the safety and efficacy of medicines even after they're approved. SPEEDING ACCESS TO NEW DRUGS For many diseases, the need for new drugs is urgent. For patients with advanced cancers of the lung and colon, for example, few therapies ex - ist. To prompt drug development and speed approval of experimental com - pounds, regulators have come up with a variety of schemes. In some cases, regulatory agencies offer incentives. Companies that receive FDA approval for a drug to treat malaria, tubercu - losis or a neglected tropical disease, REGULATORY Renovation C_report.indd 23 4/2/13 3:39 PM24 Illustrations by FRANCESCO BONGIORNI for example, receive a voucher that entitles them to a priority review of another compound of their choosing. They can keep the voucher for them - selves or sell it to another company. The voucher cuts the review time by approximately four months. Since the program began in 2007, however, only two companies have received vouchers. Last year, as part of the FDA Safety and Innovation Act, Congress extended the priority review voucher to drugs to treat rare pediatric diseases. The FDA employs a number of other mechanisms for speeding drug approvals. Priority review cuts the length of the review process. The ac - celerated approval pathway, adopted in the 1990s, allows for approval of drugs to treat serious diseases on the basis of surrogate endpoints. For in - stance, instead of providing evidence that a cancer drug extends the lives of patients with cancer, a drugmaker might only need to prove that the drug shrinks tumors, but the com - pany must conduct further studies to show a clinical benefit. The fast-track process allows for a speedy review of drugs to treat serious diseases that fill an unmet medical need. In 2012, lawmakers granted the agency a new tool to accelerate ap - provals for drugs that show early promise in treating life-threatening illnesses. Drugmakers can now apply for a \"breakthrough therapy\" designa - tion if \"preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demon - strate substantial improvement over existing therapies.\" Drugmakers who receive a breakthrough designation work closely with the FDA to develop trial designs to shorten or combine traditional phases of development. The first two breakthrough designa - tions went to U.S. drugmaker Vertex for its cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco\u2014for its use alone and in combination with another drug.THE CLINICAL -TRIAL CONUNDRUM Clinical trials constitute the most expensive aspect of drug develop - ment. To gain regulatory approval, drugs typically flow through a path - way that starts with a phase I safety study and ends with one or more large phase III trials that test the new drug against existing compounds. These studies look to \"eke out a small amount of benefit in a large broad population,\" says Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute in La Jolla, California, and author of The Creative Destruction of Medicine: How the Digital Revolution Will Create Better Health Care (Basic Books, 2012). If drugmakers could determine who is likely to respond to the medi - cation, they could then conduct smaller trials involving just a couple hundred patients. The strategy, re - ferred to as enrichment, isn't novel. But new tools, such as sequencing technologies, make it easier to iden - tify patients most likely to respond to a given drug. The cystic fibrosis drug Kalydeco is a perfect example. The drug only works in patients who have a par - ticular mutation, about 4 percent of people with the disease. Had the company tested the drug in all pa - tients with cystic fibrosis, the effect would likely have been undetectable. Instead Vertex tested the drug only in patients with the specific muta - tion. \"We need to be much more pre - cise, and we can be now,\" Topol says. \"There's all sorts of ways now that we can define the people likely to have this exquisite response.\" Another way to increase the ef - ficiency of clinical studies is to make them adaptive. Most clinical trials are designed to be static\u2014a set number of participants receive a set dose of a drug. The researchers don't see the data until the study is complete. In an adaptive trial, however, the results in-form the trial design. For example, the BATTLE study of lung cancer included multiple phases. In the first phase, par - ticipants were ran - domly assigned to receive one of four medicines. Before the study began, the researchers took a biopsy of the patients' tumors. They then used those biopsies to look for links between biomarkers and out - comes. For instance, patients with mutations in the KRAS gene tended to respond better to a drug called Sorafenib. In the second phase, pa - tients were assigned to groups based on their biomarkers. That is, the re - searchers gave participants the drugs deemed most likely to work. The FDA issued draft guidance on adaptive-tri - al designs in 2010. The EMA is open to them as well on a case-by-case ba - sis, says Hans-Georg Eichler, senior medical officer for the agency. There's a risk, of course. Smaller studies that include fewer partici - pants might fail to identify danger - ous side effects. But \"there's a danger no matter what you do,\" Topol says. Granting drugs conditional approval could mitigate some of the risk. Topol envisions that agencies would keep these medicines under tight control while they collect safety data. \"That mechanism would really be innova - tive,\" he says. BEYOND APPROVAL Just because a drug gets approved doesn't mean it's entirely safe. For decades the FDA relied on passive surveillance to identify adverse drug reactions. \"It's a very good system for identifying rare adverse events unre - lated to the indication of the drug,\" such as drug-induced liver injury, says Bruce Psaty, a drug safety expert ...there 's a danger no matter what you do. \u2014Eric Topol C_report.indd 24 4/2/13 3:18 PM PHARMA'S NEW MODEL 25\"/T_h ere hasn't been a concerted e ort to integrate risk-bene/f_i t information and provide that to patients,\" he says. \"It's a lot of work. It's not easy, and it's not exactly clear how one does it.\" A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE In a perfect world, a single agency would approve new drugs based on sound science, and the path to ap-proval would be crystal clear. Instead, countries have individual regulatory agencies that use di erent criteria, some more science-based and trans-parent than others. A drugmaker that seeks approval in China, the United States, Canada and Russia must sub- mit four separate applications. One notable exception is the Eu- ropean Union, where a central agency coordinates drug approvals. /T_h e EMA isn't a new agency, but it's one of a kind. \"In Europe you can apply for the marketing authorization that is valid for the whole European Union,\" says Lembit R\u00e4go, coordinator of qual-ity assurance and safety of medicines at the World Health Organization in Geneva. \"/T_h ere is one application and the applicant can get access to 27 na-tional markets.\" Drug regulators elsewhere have begun working together too. \"Even the big /f_i sh like the FDA and also European Medicines Agency are in-creasingly exchanging views and co-operating,\" R\u00e4go says. In 2009, the African Union launched the African Medicines Regulatory Harmonization Programme. /T_h e initiative\u2014supported by the World Health Organization, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the World Bank and others\u2014promotes regulatory harmonization and capac-ity building. \"A couple of years ago nobody was imagining that this type of harmonization would come up in poorer parts of the world,\" R\u00e4go says. One major driver of harmoniza- tion is globalization./uni00A0/T_h e /f_i rst Inter-national Conference on Harmonisa-tion of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) meeting, held in 1990, only included representa-tives from Europe, Japan and the United States. \"It was only these three regions because at this point the majority of products were man-ufactured and developed in these regions,\" says Pierre-Louis Lezotre, director of global regulatory a airs at the pharmaceutical company Al-lergan, based in Irvine, California. \"Now the situation is very di erent.\" In the United States, for example,/uni00A080 percent of active pharmaceutical in-gredients and 40 percent of /f_i nished drugs are produced abroad. To en-sure that those products are safe, \"regulators cannot work alone. /T_h ey have to work together,\" Lezotre says. /T_h e biannual ICH meetings now in-clude representatives from all over the world, including key countries like India, China and Brazil. In addition to ensuring safety, cooperation and harmonization can also help prevent duplication of ef-forts. In Africa, there are roughly 50 regulatory authorities that gov-ern drug registration. /T_h e process and paperwork di er from country to country, and the methodology is rarely transparent. As a result, drug-makers typically seek approval in just a few key countries. R\u00e4go envisions an increasingly harmonized future in which a handful of regulatory agen-cies would conduct assessments of new drugs \"and the others would just trust what they do,\" he says. \"We can't have everybody just repeating what others do. /T_h ere are just not enough resources for that.\" from the University of Washington in Seattle. But the system doesn't work so well if the goal is to pick up, as mentioned above, an increased risk of heart disease in people taking the diabetes drug Avandia. In 2008, the agency launched the Sentinel Initia-tive to provide electronic monitoring of medicines. So far, the initiative op-erates as a pilot program called Mini-Sentinel, which includes data on more than 125 million individuals. In 2010, the European Union ad- opted new legislation that strengthens oversight of drugs that have already been licensed. /T_h e new pharmaco- vigilance legislation aims to make re- porting adverse drug reactions easier and to help citizens understand the bene/f_i ts and risks of new medications. It also gives the EMA the authority to require drugmakers to conduct ef-/f_i cacy and safety studies a/f_t er a drug is approved. Risk-bene/f_i t assessments have been a topic of discussion in the United States as well. A 2012 report from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recom-mended that the FDA maintain a com-prehensive bene/f_i t and risk assessment and management plan to monitor a medication's bene/f_i ts and harms even a/f_t er it has been approved. /T_h e IOM en-visions a single document that would be publicly available. \"/T_h at becomes a potentially important document,\" says Psaty, one of the report's coauthors. Regulators see gene therapy with new hope (see Therapy's Renaissance,\" page BONGIORNI Monoclonal antibodies are the fast - est-growing class of therapeutic agents, worth over $100 billion per year. Since 1986, approximately 30 monoclonal antibodies have been introduced for clinical use, and many more are in research, de - velopmental and pre-clinical trial stages. In 2011, five of the top 12 best-selling pharmaceuti - cals were monoclonal antibodies. These drugs range from cancer-fighters like Herceptin and Avastin to drugs that help the immune system, like Humira and Remicade for arthritis and autoimmune dis - eases, respectively. They work by binding to target cells or proteins, and triggering a patient's own immune system to attack those cells. Compared to traditional drugs made through chemistry, the complex nature of these molecules makes them both helpful and challenging. While a molecule of aspirin may have a size of around 150 daltons (a measurement of mass on a molecular scale), the large and complex structures that make up monoclonal antibodies are 150,000 daltons or more. Further, antibodies are endlessly modifiable. This malleability is a double-edged sword: It makes antibodies attractive potential drugs, but also presents difficulties in characterizing them and figuring out their structure. In order to discover, create and characterize these drugs for production, researchers and drug companies are turning to new technology with the ability to track single ions and obtain a high-resolution picture of what makes up these antibodies. In some cases, that new technology is a form of mass spectrometry, a classic chemical analysis tool that has been modified to work with large molecules. \"The bigger the molecule, the more potential devia - tions in the sequence,\" says A. J. R. Heck, a professor at Utrecht University in the Netherlands who heads the bio-molecular mass spectrometry and proteomics group there. He adds that big molecules, like the novel biologic drugs, can bear a plethora of modifications. Those large molecules also present difficulties because they are not produced synthetically, but in living cells. In the past, analyzing these complex structures re - quired conventional chromatography\u2014something that worked well, says Heck, as long as the mixtures weren't too complicated. \"An antibody has a particular mass, but if it's decorated with one sugar or two, that changes the mass of these molecules slightly,\" he says. Minor alterations to the molecular structure could mean the 150,000 daltons would change by 10 or 100 daltons. \"Mass spectrometry can distinguish these things by mass, both qualitatively and quantitatively,\" says Heck. Also, the required mass resolving power has posed an additional challenge over the past few years. The mass difference between 300 daltons and 301 daltons may be easy to measure, but seeing the difference between 150,000 and 150,001 daltons\u2014a tiny change in percentage\u2014is much more difficult. \"The needed resolving power with good sensitivity has been a real bottleneck in the past,\" Heck explains. Another method previously used to analyze complex structures was ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy. \"UV can of - fer a lot of information, but when there is a small change you can't detect it,\" says Zhiqi Hao, biopharmaceuticals marketing program manager at Thermo Fisher Scientific in Fremont, California. \"On the other hand, mass spectrom - etry can analyze any tiny peak and give an accurate mass.\" A MACHINE to CAPTURE COMPLEXITY To mine the therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies, we need a powerful set of tools to analyze and understand them BY KATHARINE GAMMON C_report.indd 26 4/2/13 4:18 PM28 Illustrations by FRANCESCO BONGIORNI It used to be that mass spectrometry was restricted to the realm of small-molecule analysis, due to the inability to e ciently transfer large molecules and complexes to the gas phase. With the introduction of new ionization tech-niques, large molecules could successfully be introduced to the gas phase, making the biological molecular arena accessible for mass spectrometry. Now, the newest mass spectrometry technology opens up the detailed analysis of high-mass molecules, with sen-sitivity down to individual atoms. ENTER THE ORBITRAP Introduced in 2005, the Orbitrap has changed the way companies and researchers work with large biomolecules. \"It's like deep sequencing for genomes,\" Heck says. \"/T_h is allows sequencing for more proteins than ever before.\" /T_h e machine, which costs $500,000-750,000, was invented by Alexander Makarov, director of research for life sciences mass spectrometry at /T_h ermo Scienti/f_i c. Makarov says he wanted to create an analyzer with high analytical power in a small package. \"/T_h e major advan-tage of the Orbitrap is that fundamentally it's simple\u2014some electrodes trap ions and others listen to them,\" he explains. \"We listen while they're moving, so they're not destroyed\u2014and the longer we listen to them, the more sensitive we are to them.\" /T_h e concept for the machine is rooted in the principle of orbital trapping\u2014the ability to trap charged particles in electrostatic /f_i elds, de/f_i ned by the American chemist K. H. Kingdon in 1923. Experiments over the next few decades did show that charged particles could be trapped in elec-trostatic /f_i elds with masses separated, but the results were very basic and low-performance. In Makarov's invention, the ions rotate around an electrode while undergoing harmonic oscillations along the axis of rotation at frequencies related to their mass-to-charge ratio. He joined a small startup in the 1990s and won an award from the U.K. government to purchase parts for the experimental setup. In 2000, /T_h ermo Electron Corporation acquired the company and Makarov turned his e orts to interfacing the Orbitrap to continuous ion sources, rather than discrete pulses of ions. /T_h e machine takes precisely controlled ion popula- tions and injects them into the trap, where they are col-lected and cooled through collisions. /T_h ose cooled ions are injected with high energy and precise trajectory into the mass analyzer. /T_h ere, they oscillate across the trap at a frequency proportional to their mass-to-charge ratio. /T_h e machine detects and processes an image of the ion motion. /T_h e signal gets processed and converted into information about the mass. /T_h e longer the ions are bounced around, the higher the resolution. /T_h e path from idea to invention was paved with challenges, says Ma-karov. \"I counted six or seven times when we could have stopped it and said, 'No, it's not going to /f_l y',\" he recalls. Even so, he powered on, and the Orbitrap has now split into two families of analyzers. \"To make this instrument work, you needed to have a lot of development on external com-ponents to store ions and then get them into the analyzer. To provide the high vacuum in-side the system, this is one of the best pump systems in the world,\" he says, adding that there are 100-200 miles of parts inside the unit. Orbitrap-based mass spectrometers have become a workhorse in proteomics and are also widely used in all major applications of life science mass spectrometry, such as metabolomics, environmental, food and safety analysis. Makarov won the 2008 American Society for Mass Spec-trometry award for Distinguished Contribution in Mass Spectrometry for his development of the Orbitrap. IMPROVING ON THE INVENTION Even a/f_t er the Orbitrap was created in 2005, there was room for more innovation, especially in the life sciences. Mass spectrometers were too slow to really detect large mol-ecules such as antibodies, says Heck. Ions move through the machine at a certain speed, and partly because large molecules are slow, they dri/f_t o trajectory\u2014becoming lost before they reached the detector. \"We found a way to make large molecules more focused partly by trapping them in a particular compartment, enhancing the transmission more than a hundred-fold.\" Heck and his colleagues dampened the motion of high mass molecules in a dedicated compartment within the Financial incentives can drive biotechnology advances around the world (see \"Sweet Source of Power,\" page 79). C_report.indd 28 4/2/13 3:17 PM PHARMA'S NEW MODEL 29Orbitrap and altered the software to detect ions at a high - er range. But the rest of the hardware of the instrument changed little. Last year Makarov, Heck and other re - searchers showed that a modified Orbitrap has the poten - tial to detect individual ions, even when they have masses near 1 million daltons. Heck says he is excited about the mass-spectrometry possibilities both in and out of biopharmaceuticals. \"It will enable us to characterize hundreds of antibodies in a matter of a day,\" he says. \"You could change the cell-culture conditions, used to biologically synthesize the antibodies, and use mass spec to read out if the change makes the structure better or worse.\" An Orbitrap can also character - ize even larger protein complexes\u2014such as whole viruses and the ribosome, a protein-based natural nanomachinery that helps make other proteins. EXPANDING USES FOR MASS SPECTROMETRY For pharmaceutical companies, technology like the Orbi - trap is not only useful for discovery and analysis, but it can also help with ensuring that high-quality molecules are being produced. \"To bring complex molecules to the mar - ket, you have to show that they are safe and effective,\" says Gurmil Gendeh, market development manager at Thermo Fisher. \"You have to show that molecules you are making from one batch to another are identical and you have to characterize all modifications and impurities.\" Gendeh says that he often hears from industry partners that they want to shrink the size of quality-control labora - tories and move to a platform method with single analysis to look at multiple attributes. \"Using mass spectrometry can save them time, bench space, and from one analysis you get a lot of information,\" he says. \"We're seeing a slow migration of mass spectrome - try: First it was used in discovery, and now quality control, because it can be a single platform.\" For antibody-based drugs, the process of making the drug is the product\u2014 something that companies want to protect, says Gendeh. In addition, the technology can help with the thorny issue of biosimilar drugs: biological molecules, such as an - tibodies, that have a slightly different shape but that might act similarly in the body. \"Companies want to ensure safe - ty, but also protect their own product from being copied by other companies,\" explains Thermo Fisher's Hao. \"This is to say that biotherapeutic drugs are extremely hard to develop, and making one that is similar is very hard too.\" That's another reason why analyzing the exact molecular structure is key. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Creating antibody-based drugs is already complex, but a new line of research is going a step further and combin - ing traditional drugs and antibody drugs, which creates a combination known as antibody-drug conjugates. Alain Beck, director of antibody physical chemistry at the Centre d'Immunologie Pierre Fabre in St. Julien-en-Genevois, France, says that attaching small-molecule cytotoxic cancer drugs to monoclonal antibodies can make drugs capable of attacking specific tumor-associated antigens. The Orbitrap and other technology can help to detect and characterize these molecules, which are even more complex than typical antibodies. \"These drugs have bet - ter outcomes, because they only target the cancer cells, leaving the normal cells untouched,\" says Beck. \"The anti - bodies are used as a carrier, which targets a receptor that's overexpressed in a cancer cell. The result is that the drug is delivered right into the cell.\" The problem, says Beck, is that creating a consistent batch of effective and safe drugs is a challenge\u2014and another one that technology like the Orbitrap can address. So far, these drugs haven't been as clinically success - ful as the so-called naked antibodies that don't have cy - totoxic drugs attached, but Beck says that 30 of them are in the pipeline now to be tested and some are generating good results. For instance, Adcetris (brentuximab vedo - tin), produced by Seattle Genetics, was approved in 2011 to treat lymphoma, and Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtan - sine), a modified form of Herceptin used to treat breast cancer, made by Roche's Genentech unit, was approved in February. Beck says that new technology might enable compa - nies to develop new cancer drug targets that reduce resis - tance to current drug treatments. Over the past 30 years, more than 40 anti - bodies and their de - rivatives have been approved to treat various indications, nearly half of them for use in oncology. The success of new drugs could lie in their ability to attack the same targets in novel ways, like exploit - ing pathways, or even in finding new targets. \"The trend is currently to combine good ideas,\" says Beck. \"Even though there are still a lot of technical challenges to solve, hopefully we'll see more potent drugs with these techniques.\" From discovery to quality control, pioneering technol - ogy is advancing the pace of pharmaceutical innovation. And in the future, the emergence of further large-mole - cule drugs is sure to yield a new generation of tools to un - derstand and produce them. ... biotherapeutic drugs are extremely hard to develop, and making one that is similar is very hard too. \u2014Z hiqi Hao C_report.indd 29 BONGIORNI The life science-innovation ecosystem includes a delicate balance of players that are highly evolved to do what they do best\u2014work - ing collectively toward better health for a better value. In many ways, their success depends upon their ability to collaborate. Large pharmaceutical companies need new innovations coming from academic research institutions, emerging biotech firms and medical device and diagnostics businesses in order to thrive. Disrupting the innovation ecosystem at any point has a ripple effect on all other constituents, system-wide. Financial pressures as a result of the economic downturn of 2008 have had a dramatic impact on the life sciences industry, creating an environment less conducive to innovation. A number of venture capital firms have stopped in - vesting altogether in the sector, and there are fewer investments in life sci - ence companies. According to the 2013 PricewaterhouseCoopers MoneyTree Report, the amount of venture capital dollars invested in the life science sector was down by 15% in 2012 compared to 2011. This is bad news coming on the heels of several of the toughest years the industry has ever seen. Additionally, the U.S. government's fiscal crisis has negatively impacted innovation at its earliest stages, with reductions in funding for basic biomedical research from government agencies, such as National Institutes of Health. This decrease in investment in the life sciences creates an innovation bot - tleneck in our industry pipeline. Right now, late stage pipelines in large phar - maceutical companies are quite healthy, but there is a serious lack of early-stage assets, and the next generation of novel treatments are at risk of never making it to the patients who need them. Much like the ongoing patent cliff, the pharmaceutical industry now faces an innovation cliff that could stagnate the sector. Big pharmaceutical firms have a vested interest in and a responsi - bility to cultivate a healthy life science-innovation ecosystem. However, this is new terrain for all of us, and large companies are experimenting with a num - ber of different strategies to help the industry thrive. INVESTING IN INNOVATION One way big pharma is investing in innovation at its earliest stages is through partnerships with universities and research institutions. Through these al - liances, academic researchers receive much-needed funds to advance their discoveries, while pharmaceutical corporations obtain insights and expertise complementary to their own. Although such partnerships aren't new, theStrategic partnerships in the pharmaceutical industry may be the key to rescuing early-stage innovation from a perilous fall BY DIEGO MIRALLES Averting an INNOVATION CLIFF C_report.indd 30 4/2/13 2:52 PM PHARMA'S NEW MODEL 31 industry is exploring fresh approach - es, some of which involve increasingly larger-scale collaborations with the academic world. The ultimate goal of these ventures is the translation of early-stage discoveries into thera - peutic candidates. The Janssen Phar - maceuticals Companies have entered into a number of these translational partnerships with academia, includ - ing one with Vanderbilt University's Center for Neuroscience Drug Dis - covery that has already led to the ini - tiation of clinical studies of a novel class of medicines for schizophrenia. Other approaches to translational research being undertaken by big pharma include Bayer HealthCare's launch of the CoLaborator, in San Francisco's Mission Bay, which aims to move basic research discoveries to the drug development stage. Ad - ditionally, Merck has established the California Institute for Biomedical Research (Calibr) to conduct early-stage drug discovery work before in-licensing or passing drug candidates off to others in the industry for clini - cal development. Nearly every large pharmaceutical firm also has a corporate venture arm, which further enhances the industry's active role in investing in early-stage life science startups. Some companies are also forming limited partner - ships with venture capital firms. For example, GlaxoSmithKline recently committed $50 million to Sander - ling Ventures's early-stage healthcare fund, and last year Merck teamed up with Flagship Ventures to form a $250 million fund to bankroll early-stage biotech businesses. This investment model gives pharmaceutical com-panies greater reach and exposure to new technologies, sourced via the venture capital teams. Casting a wider net means uncovering exciting dis - coveries to fuel the pipeline. IMPROVING PARTNERING Pharmaceutical firms can also sup - port innovation by transforming the way in which we interact with poten - tial partners. Currently, early-stage businesses have difficulty finding the right point of entry into large phar - maceutical companies for the pur - poses of partnering. To make it easier for our partners, we are establishing regional Johnson & Johnson innova - tion centers that will provide direct access to the Johnson & Johnson Family of Companies for local and regional scientists, entrepreneurs and businesses looking for partnerships. We are locating Johnson & Johnson innovation centers in San Francisco, Boston, London and Shanghai, all re - gions with thriving life science com - munities that use diverse technolo - gies. Each of these centers will focus on identifying and building alliances. Each innovation center will house J&J science and technology experts and have full and broad deal-making capabilities, with flexibility to adapt deal structures, enabling us to sup - port and fuel regional innovation. I personally have been involved in a number of initiatives within the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson that are designed to support the life science ecosystem, including the Johnson & Johnson in - novation center in San Francisco and also Janssen Labs at San Diego. Jans - sen Labs provides a capital-efficient lab facility and facility operations platform designed to cut the time and cost of getting potential innova - tions to patients, while still allowing entrepreneurs maximum freedom to grow their businesses. Companies oc - cupying space at Janssen Labs have secured wet lab and office spaces, as well as access to shared core facilities equipment that many new firms could not afford to purchase on their own. The \"no strings attached\" model that we have employed has been highly attractive to emerging businesses, as Janssen Research & Development does not receive equity in the companies, nor is Janssen entitled to rights to products developed at Jans - sen Labs unless one of our companies enters into a sepa - rate agreement. We are already show - ing signs of success, having welcomed 18 businesses into the space\u2014and even \"graduated\" one firm that was so successful it outgrew our facilities in only a year. I am very encouraged by the broad range of experimentation being undertaken by large pharmaceutical companies. Some of the approaches to supporting innovation are already proving to be quite successful\u2014help - ing us bypass the looming innovation cliff. Big pharma's big experiments, like all experiments, involve quite a bit of trial and error. It is a process that is going to take some refinement and iteration until we get it right. But I'm excited to see that as a whole, pharma is stepping up to meet the challenges facing our sector and working to cre - ate an environment more conducive to innovation. This in turn will begin to fill the pipeline with new health - care products, and we'll see our entire industry thrive.

C_report.indd 31 4/2/13 2:49 PM32 Illustrations by FRANCESCO BONGIORNI SPONSOR PROFILE: THAILAND Thailand's Life Sciences Business Hub THAILAND CENTER OF EXCELLENCE FOR LIFE SCIENCES Thailand has a long history of world class R&D in the agricultural sciences, but it has been in the past ten years that a concerted effort, linking university based research, private industry and government support, has taken shape to promote the country's life sciences sector. In addition to its well-known attractive business environment for foreign investment, low cost of living, and modern amenities, Thailand can now boast of a well-developed physical and human infrastructure speci cally bene ting biotech and other life science enterprises. THE LIFE SCIENCES SECTOR GROWS For the 10 years ending in 2009, the number of private sector biotech companies nationwide grew at an average annual rate of 11%. For medical related biotech companies, the equivalent rate was 20%. In the private and public sectors com-bined, Thais currently employed in science and technology elds now number about three million, includ-ing over 60,000 engaged in R&D. The environment for science based enterprises in Thailand will continue to improve. By the end of this year, Thailand Science Park will have completed its Innova-tion Cluster II expansion. Mod-eled on the concept of \"work-play integration,\" it has been designed speci cally to meet the needs and expectations of today's talented knowledge workers. TSP inhabits 80 acres just outside Bangkok and is just one of 56 industrial estates, parks, and zones in the country. TCELS PROMOTES SECTOR GROWTH At the center of this national effort sits the Thailand Center of Excel-lence for Life Sciences (TCELS), an independent public organization under the auspices of the Ministry of Science and Technology. As Thailand's life sciences knowledge management hub, TCELS' broad mission is to: (1) promote and support Thailand's life sciences infrastructure to bring it in line with the highest of international standards of capability and competi-tiveness; (2) to coordinate among domestic and international agencies in order to facilitate the translation of research initiatives into attractive business opportunities; (3) to chan-nel internal and external resources where they promise to bring the most bene t to investors and other stakeholders, the Thai economy as a whole, and the Thai people. TCELS STRIVES FOR COMMERCIAL SUCCESS The commercialization efforts of TCELS and its research part-ners are starting to bear fruit in a number of areas. In 2006, a team C_report.indd 32 4/3/13 1:11 AM PHARMA'S NEW MODEL 33from Prince of Songkla University located in southern Thailand, sup-ported by TCELS funding, managed to isolate and extract a protease inhibitor in natural rubber latex serum which has skin whiten-ing properties. It has since been successfully commercialized and TCELS continues to work with the business sector to develop other rubber latex compounds that have cosmetic industry potential. Geneticists at the Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, have merged their own research with that of the international community to produce a multi-drug test kit for HIV patients that will scan their DNA for pharmacogenomic mark-ers that predict the likelihood of adverse drug reactions. This allows more effective original treatment regime prescription and spares the patient and the health care system costly treatment realignments. Today, this genetic testing service has been launched and Thais are already enjoying the bene t of drug optimization. TCELS continues to work with the Pharmacogenom- ics team on the commercializa-tion of this and other personal-ized medicine related products. TCELs work has resulted in the commercialization of a Japa-nese encephalitis vaccine. Now, researchers at Mahidol University have also developed a promising vaccine candidate for all four sero-types of dengue fever, a mosquito borne virus that infl icts between 50 and 100 million people annually in a growing portion of the globe. TCELS is supporting this initiative with funds towards a pre-industrial to industrial level vaccine manu-facturing and QC/QA testing facility that will also serve as a platform for other work on infectious diseases such as Chikungunya disease. These are just a few of the promising initiatives in which TCELS provides funding and coordina-tion in the larger effort to promote and commercialize publicly funded research in Thailand. Other product areas in which TCELS provides such support include gene and stem cell therapy, climatotherapy, medical devices, and medical robotics. TCELS SUPPORTS INFRASTRUCTURE TCELS is also actively involved in the development of Thailand's life sci-ences infrastructure to ensure that it meets the highest of international standards. Developmental initia-tives include health product safety testing centers, an animal breeding center, a laboratory animal monitor-ing center, a network of clinical trial sites and data management units and intellectual property manage- ment. Through the years TCELS has created many new agencies such as the Bioinformatics Systems Unit and the Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank to provide services to innovators. TCELS REACHES OUT On July 17-19, 2013, TCELS will host the ASEAN Life Sciences Confer-ence & Exhibition 2013 at the Queen Sirikit National Convention Center in Bangkok. This three day event, involving world-class speakers and exhibitors from 10 ASEAN coun-tries and more, will be of interest to researchers, private sector stakeholders, government of cials, and any other parties interested in the status and development of the life sciences sector in the ASEAN region.

C_report.indd 33 4/3/13 1:14 AM 2013 itself. For example, the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) hosted 14,040 partnering meetings at its 2009 convention in Atlanta, Georgia, and that number rose to 25,291 at its conference in Boston last year\u2014an increase of 80 percent. As Jim Greenwood, BIO president and CEO, says, \"The BIO Business Forum at the BIO International Convention is the in-dustry's largest partnering event and allows important business decisions to be made, which are often times critical to the advancement of our in-dustry.\" Likewise, the metrics tracked in our Scorecard determine the fate of biotechnology around the world. To keep feeding the biotechnology- growth engine, many countries form unique collaborations. Documenting this, the 2012 Scorecard included several WORLDVIEW SCORECARD In many ways, one word\u2014 growth\u2014describes the heart of biotechnology, a field of ever-expanding knowledge and applica-tions for which to use it. In fact, growth is what drives the Scientific American Worldview Scorecard. Our first Scorecard, published in 2009, analyzed 36 countries, while this year's version has expanded to include 54. That increase reflects the ongoing development of the field D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 34 4/3/13 6:14 AMGLOBAL BIOTECHNOLOGY INNOVATION 35 measurements of partnering between companies and countries worldwide. Since then, even more examples have emerged. For instance, the U.K.'s Imperial College London established a diabetes center in Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates, which happens to be one of the new countries on the 2013 Scorecard. Similarly, India's Department of Biotechnology and the European Union (EU) recently announced a joint project to use biological techniques to treat industrial and household wastewater for reuse in agricultural projects. India also collaborated with China to sequence the genomes of 90 types of chickpeas\u2014as detailed in a Nature Biotechnology article published online on 27 January 2013. This work involved the International Chickpea Genome Sequencing Consortium, headquartered in Hyderabad, India, and BGI, high-powered sequencing center in Shenzhen (for more on BGI, see page 88). Hyderabad also hosted BioAsia 2013, a bioscience partnering forum that included members of drug regulatory agencies from a wide range of countries: the Czech Republic, India, Jordan, Lithuania, Malaysia, Sweden, the Philippines, South Africa, the U.K. and the U.S. It is our hope that the Worldview Scorecard's growing history provides companies, countries and other biotechnology stakeholders with useful data to assess potential collaborations. Indeed, the seeds for some of tomorrow's most effective partnerships might well lie within the following pages. The recent growth in collabora- tive activities parallels indications of potential industry recovery reported in the 2012 Scorecard. This year's data revisit that topic to see if the global biotechnology sector really is on the upswing, or if early indicators merely reflected a blip in those data. Blip or not, the expansion of the Scorecard's list of countries, the industry statistics noted above and the continuing trend toward collaboration all indicate growth in a range of re-lated biotechnology sectors. Like any form of growth, however, some starts and stops emerge, and our data over half a decade reflect this intermit-tence in the biotechnology-innovation efforts of many countries. Ultimately, the most successful nations\u2014and companies\u2014find ways to move ahead in any \"PHARMA'S NEXT BIG MOVE,\" (PAGE 12). Measuring Innovation /T_h e evolution of biotechnology demands adaptive means of tracking a country's capabilities Bill Gates once told The Wall Street Journal, \"I believe in innovation and that the way you get innovation is you fund research and you learn the basic facts.\" Learn-ing the basic facts about biotech innovation is the purpose of the Sci-enti c American Worldview Scorecard. Like last year, the 2013 Scorecard is comprised of six crucial categories: Intellectual Property (IP), Intensity, Enterprise Support, Education/Work-force, Foundations, and Policy and Stability. By using this diverse set of measurements, the Scorecard gathers a wide range of biotechnology-related information that indicates a country's innovative capabilities and successes. The main categories are then bro- ken down further into multiple subcat-egories (except for IP). This approach ensures that the overall assessment ( nal score) is as conclusive and inclusive as possible. We rank each country's performance on these sub-categories\u2014such as \"public company employees per capita\" in the Intensity category\u2014most of which are assessed on a scale of 0 to 10, with the lowest-ranked nation scored as 0 and the highest-ranked one scored as 10. To assign a score for each category, we calculated the mean score from the components. A country's mean score for a series of components makes up its score for the category (except for IP, which arises from a single score, as noted). To get the nal scores, we add up each nation's category scores, which get normalized on a scale of 0 to 50. (For more details, see Methods, page 65.) Over the ve years that we've compiled the Scorecard, we have adapted the methodology to continually improve our analysis. For one thing, the list of countries keeps growing, as we access more data sources. In addition, we've adjusted the categories and intellectual property New studies show the ongoing value of IP protectioncomponents. As we continue in our quest to evaluate the world's \"innovation potential,\" our list of nations and our scoring methods will no doubt continue to evolve along with the eld itself. Interestingly, many experts believe that biotechnology remains in its infancy, leaving much room for growth. For example, Gillian Woollett, vice president at Avalere Health in Washington, D.C., explored innova-tion in biotechnology in the January 2012 issue of Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics . She wrote that discus- sions of innovation are \"often limited to products represented by current industry pipelines, as though the achievements of biotechnology to date represent the full extent of the types of innovation we can expect in the fu-ture.\" Then she added: \"One can more optimistically propose that biotech has barely begun to use its full scienti c and conceptual capacity.\" The same might be said for this Scorecard. We expect our evaluation of innovation in biotechnology to cover an increasing number of countries. Even more important, the results from our analysis have only begun to impact this industry. Much more lies ahead as we continue to measure innovation. According to the U.K.'s Intel-lectual Property Of ce, IP encompasses \"any forms of original creation that can be bought or sold.\" The World Intellectual Property Organization adds that IP \"refers to creations of the mind: inventions, lit-erary and artistic works, and symbols, names, images, and designs used in commerce.\" Many of those features 10 8 6420 austria belgiumargentina australiachile china brazil canada 37 9.05 9.05 9.05 apply to biotechnology. Consequently, IP makes up one of the categories of this Scorecard. Nonetheless, in many countries the strength of IP protection is not easily measured. As a result, some of the countries on our list were not included in this index, and do not get ranked on this metric. A range of recent information, how- ever, shows that IP must be protected for a country to excel in biotechnology. In 2012, for instance, BIO published \"The Economic Contribution of Univer-sity/Nonpro t Inventions in the United States: 1996-2010.\" Based on 15 years of information, this report concludes that \"the total contribution of these academic licensors to gross industry output ranges from $199B to $836B, in 2005 $US Dollars.\" Consequently, if a country fails to provide academic re-searchers with powerful IP protection, much basic research might not reach industry, where it fuels signi cant economic advances. In fact, some re-search might fail to appear worthwhile without adequate IP protection. As we showed last year (\"Drilling Down on IP,\" 2012 Scienti c American Worldview), IP strength correlates with the number of clinical trials, relative to population size, that take place in a country. Nations around the world realize the importance of strong IP protec-tion to their biotechnology industry. Last December, the Indian govern-ment released draft guidelines on processing biotech patents. Regarding these guidelines, Kalpana Mittal, an associate patent attorney at Lakshmi- kumaran and Sridharan in New Delhi, India, wrote that \"a biotechnological invention must possess the three prerequisites of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability in order for an application to be granted.\" She added, \"The draft guidelines empha-size India's intention to prevent the misappropriation of biological re-sources and traditional knowledge by introducing provisions for mandatory prior permission from the National Biodiversity Authority by the applicant for any patent application based on research or any information related to biological resources obtained from India.\" This analysis by Mittal indicates an increasing sensitivity to IP protec-tion in India\u2014a country that nishes very poorly on the IP index used in our Scorecard (see below). Most of the countries that lead the way in biotechnol-ogy innovation orchestrate broad efforts to protect the IP produced in public and private organizations. In the United States, for example, any effort to reduce IP protection spawns intense debate and analysis. (For an example related to biologic drugs, see page 18.) No country can emerge as a leader in this eld with-out addressing the IP-protection issue. ireland israelindia united states saudi arabiasingapore\"any forms of original creation that can be bought or sold.\" thailand4.95 6.620.49 6.03 6.66 10:54 AM38 FOR A CASE STUDY OF INTENSITY IN ACTION, READ \"CHINA STAR,\" (PAGE 14). austria 1.77 belgium 2.57argentina 0.08 australia 4.62 chile 0.02 china 1.06brazil 2.82 canada 2.25 Finland 0.67 France 2.15Czech Republic 1.65 Denmark 7.53 Hong Kong 1.99 Hungary 4.22Germany 1.33 ireland 4.31 israel 1.76india 1.40 indonesia 0.10 italy 1.09 japan 1.38 netherlands 2.52 new zealand 4.30malaysia 0.01 mexico 1.89 poland 2.93norway 0.92 russia 2.51 south africa 1.72 sweden 1.56south korea 1.71 spain 3.88saudi arabia 0.01 singapore 3.84 D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 38 4/3/13 8:25 AMWORLDVIEW SCORECARD 39 Intensity Denmark three-peats to stay on top When it comes to Intensity, a measurement of a country's overall efforts to drive inno- vation in biotechnology, Denmark, the United States, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand lead this year's Score-card. Moreover, the top-two countries, Denmark and the United States, run away from their competitors. In this category\u2014consisting of ve compo-nents that cover a range of topics, including metrics related to public companies, money spent on R&D, pat-ent data and more\u2014Denmark reigns as the three-peat winner, nishing rst since our 2011 issue. Likewise, the United States holds the second spot for the third time in three years. To capture the Intensity category, Denmark took the top spot in three of the seven components that make up Intensity, including \"public biotechnol-ogy company employees per capita,\" \"public biotechnology company revenues per US$ billion GDP\" and \"biotech patents per total patents led with the Patents Cooperation Treaty\" (a process facilitating international patenting). Those three top component scores essentially carried Denmark to the top spot in Intensity. The United States took the top spots in two of the components: \"value added of knowledge- and technology-intensive industries\" and \"business expenditures on biotech-nology R&D.\" The United States also scored reasonably well in most of the other components. Perhaps the most-surprising top- ten nish comes from Poland. Its Inten-sity score of 2.93 earned it tenth place switzerland 3.85 united kingdom 2.50taiwan, china 0.17 turkey 0.32 united states 6.91thailand 0.02 in this category, a rocket ride from its 24th place in 2012. Unfortunately, this improvement comes more from changes in the calculation of this cat-egory than from initiatives in Poland. Two of the high nishers in Inten- sity on the 2012 Scorecard, Estonia and Switzerland\u2014ranking second and third, respectively\u2014dropped out of this year's top ve. That is little surprise for Estonia. It nished high in 2012 because we only had data for it on a single metric, \"public companies per million population,\" which was removed from this year's calculations. Switzerland's fall stemmed from several fac-tors. For one thing, it dropped in one of the components: It earned a 7.09 in \"public company revenues per US$ billion GDP\" in 2012, but that number dropped to 5.75 this year. In short, that shows a drop in earnings for the country. In addition, Switzer-land scored very poorly in one of the new components, \"value added of knowledge- and technology-intensive industries.\" In combination, Switzer-land's scores on Intensity dropped it to the eighth spot. While Switzerland tumbled, some countries climbed in this category. For instance, Australia moved up in Intensity from seventh in 2012 to third this year. Likewise, Hungary moved from 14th in 2012 to sixth in 2013. Also, Spain worked its way from 11th place in Intensity last year to seventh this year. These climbs show signs of countries on the move in biotechnology. Perhaps surprisingly, China\u2014a country often cited as an up-and-coming powerhouse in biotechnology\u2014 nishes near the back of the pack. Nonethe-less, this country nearly doubled its Intensity score since last year. Denmark took the top spot in three of the seven components that make up intensity. 8 7654321 D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 39 4/3/13 5:32 PMTo drive domestic biotechnology startups and encour- age foreign companies to establish domestic facili-ties, a country must provide Enterprise Support. This metric quanti es a nation's business-friendly features and the availability of capital in various forms. Without Enter-prise Support, it becomes dif cult to start and grow a com-pany, and it diminishes the value of other components that support biotechnology. In a theme that we see repeated in the Scorecard, countries that are perceived as presenting great opportunities\u2014such as the United Kingdom\u2014often do not score highly in measures of supportive elements. This is partially a refl ection of the nature of industry: busi-ness opportunities exist where problems can be solved. So, resolving enterprise support or other problems to tap an underserved market, to reduce operating costs or to en-able new business models can yield great returns. Mature markets, which tend to have good enterprise support, and other supportive elements, tend to be low-growth opportu-nities (despite often being large markets). This section reveals significant change this year. For two years running, Hong Kong and Singapore topped the list. This year they have slipped to fourth and fifth place, respectively, while the United States, India and Israel have advanced to first, second and third places, respec-tively. When evaluating these new leaders it is important to keep the scores in context.

D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 40 4/3/13 8:29 AMWORLDVIEW SCORECARD 41 past that enterprise support alone did not make Hong Kong and Singapore global innovation leaders in biotech-nology, it is likewise important to consider the impact of the other Scorecard elements in gauging the future prospects for the United States, India and Israel. Ger-many, Puerto Rico and the emirate of Dubai bear witness to the limits of enterprise support. All have engaged in ambitious plans to support life science enterprises, but saw only limited sustained impacts from their initiatives. Nonetheless, notice that several Gulf countries\u2014Kuwait, Qatar and the UAE\u2014reached respectable ranking in Enterprise Support, largely due to the availability of venture capital.As mentioned above, the United Kingdom failed to score highly in this category, ranking a poor 27th. Worse yet, the United Kingdom ranked 14th in Enterprise Support in our 2012 Scorecard. This is clearly not a healthy trend for a country expected to play a strong role in the biotechnology industry. As mentioned briefl y in the introduction to this section, however, some players in the United Kingdom's biotechnology industry initiate collaboration in other coun-tries. To attract as much collaboration at home, the United Kingdom needs high scores for Enterprise Support. As Singapore and Hong Kong have slipped from the lead, it is worth asking: Will their past leadership in this area deliver fruit?Argentina Australia Austria Belgium Brazil Canada Chile China Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hong Kong Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Ireland Israel Italy Japan Kuwait Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Malaysia Mexico Netherlands New Zealand Norway Philippines Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Russia Saudi Arabia Singapore Slovak Republic South Africa South Korea Spain Sweden Switzerland Taiwan, China Thailand Turkey Ukraine UAE United Kingdom Luxembourg Luxembourg Malaysia Malaysia Mexico Mexico Netherlands Netherlands New Zealand New Zealand Norway Norway Philippines Philippines Poland Poland Portugal Portugal Puerto Rico Puerto Rico Qatar Qatar Russia Russia Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia Singapore Singapore Slovak Republic Slovak Republic South Africa South Africa South Korea South Korea Spain Spain Sweden Sweden Switzerland Switzerland Taiwan, China Taiwan, China Thailand Thailand Turkey Turkey Ukraine Ukraine UAE UAE United Kingdom United Kingdom 4.17 5.53 3.21 4.59 4.26 4.40 4/10/13 AM42 EGYPT EDUCATES ITS INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY COMMUNITY (SEE \"REDRAFTING SCIENCE & SOCIETY,\" PAGE 76). argentina Austria Australia Belgium Brazil Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hong Kong Ireland Israel Italy Japan Latvia Lithuania New Zealand Norway Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Russia TurkeyTaiwan, China SwitzerlandSweden AMWORLDVIEW SCORECARD 43 Education / Workforce Iceland turns up the heat in the battle for producing high-tech personnel Want to build a biotechnology nation? Don't forget the people. Any country with biotechnology aspira-tions needs a strong nish in our Education/Work- force category. In short, biotechnology research depends on people. It is a knowledge-intensive industry, requiring skilled scientists and other workers. Even non-research activities require familiarity with science to interface with researchers, physicians, regulators or other players. Accordingly, many managers at biotechnology compa-nies\u2014who in other industries might only have training in management-related disciplines\u2014often have advanced science degrees, making education an important measure-ment of a country's capacity for biotechnology innovation. In sum, these human resources serve as inputs that help a country build an innovation-based biotechnology industry. This year, Iceland earned our top spot in Education/ Workforce. In 2011, Iceland tied with South Korea for 13th place in this category. In 2012, Iceland moved up to seventh, tying with Malaysia. This year, Iceland edged out the United States, the runner-up in this category. All along, Iceland's drive to the top of this category depended on its supremacy in one component, \"R&D personnel per thousand employ-ment.\" It nished strong in that component in 2011, topped it in 2012 and nished second in it this year, with Finland grabbing the top spot. The United States also shows consistent strength in this category, winning it in 2011, nishing sixth in 2012 and coming in second this year. The United States continues to take top honors for brain gain, by luring the most inter-national students. Although the United States is often chas-tised for lackluster rankings on educational metrics, its high proportion of educated workers and strong brain gain combine to give it a high score in this category. Despite the United States's strong nish in brain gain, some students do go home after earning their degrees, and that factor generates our \"talent retention\" compo-nent. This year, Mexico leads that component, with more of its students seeking to return home after study abroad than any other country. Being at the bottom of this list is the least desirable spot\u2014China's position two years ago and India's in 2012. Now, China and India tie for the worst \"talent retention,\" with 90.8 percent of their graduates in U.S. doctoral programs not wishing to return to their native countries. When we rst included this metric we wondered if China and India would improve their talent retention, but it appears that they are sustaining their high rates of mi-gratory desire. The next two countries on the list are South Korea, with 86 percent of graduates not wishing to return, and Australia, with 81 percent of graduates not wishing to return. Interestingly, Australia is one of the leading desti-nations of international students\u2014although so many of its own who study in the United States want to stay there. Chile china Czech Republic DenmarkHungary Iceland Indonesia Luxembourg Mexico Netherlands Saudi Arabia Singapore Slovak Republic Ukraine United Kingdom United States0.54 3.32 2:33 PMFoundations A trio of countries dominates the top Every business depends on some sort of infrastruc- ture, and this category measures those capabilities. Since the start of our Scorecard in 2009, Finland has ranked high in this category: third in 2009, rst in 2010, second in 2011, rst in 2012 and rst again this year. Neighboring Sweden can boast a similar record: eighth in 2009, fth in 2010, rst in 2011, second in 2012 and third this year. This year's runner-up, Switzerland, has also nished strongly in this category for years. Several of the components here also produce in- teresting results. In \"business expenditures on R&D,\" for example, Israel and Finland have nished rst and second, respectively, this year and last. As we showed last year, however, they differ greatly in the sources of these expenditures. Israel's business expenditures come largely from foreign countries, indicating this country's reputation as one of the globe's go-to locations for R&D. In contrast, Finland's business R&D is largely locally-sourced, meaning that Finnish companies have suf cient bulk and con dence to invest in R&D domestically. Scandinavia also runs away with our \"entrepreneur- ship and opportunity\" component, with Denmark leading the way, followed by Sweden, Finland and Norway, in order. This metric indicates, among other things, the odds of creating spin-offs from universities or companies. Conse-quently, a strong score in this component could indicate extremely strong growth in biotechnology ahead. For anyone interested in the concept of clustering, this area offers a great example, although it is surprising to see such dominance in a component from one geographic region.Argentina Australia Austria Belgium Brazil Canada Chile China Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hong Kong Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Ireland Israel Italy Japan Kuwait Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Malaysia Mexico Netherlands New Zealand Norway Philippines Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Russia Saudi Arabia Singapore Slovak Republic South Africa South Korea Spain Sweden Switzerland Taiwan, China Thailand Turkey Ukraine UAE United Kingdom United States44 DUBAI BUILDS FOUNDATIONS WITH GUSTO (SEE \"CALLING FOR COLLABORATORS,\" 80).1.31 6.50 3.17 7.98 0.61 0.94 4.82 7.84 7.36 3.18 3.16 3.79 D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 44 4/10/13 7:14 AMWORLDVIEW SCORECARD 45 WORLDVIEW SCORECARD PB WORLDVIEW SCORECARD 45 WORLDVIEW SCORECARD This component also helped to propel a newcomer, the United Arab Emirates, to a very respectable eighth-place nish in this category. It earned that spot by encouraging entrepreneurs and developing high quality infrastructure overall, a feature that makes this country proud. Similar kudos do not go to the United States in this category, which placed 12th, dropping two places from 2012 and three compared to its ranking in 2011. Overall, the United States receives middle-of-the-pack scores for most of the components. Only its 12th-place nish in \"en-trepreneurship and opportunity\" keeps it at a decent spot in Foundations overall. The crucial information from this category emerges from countries like South Korea and Iceland, this year's fourth- and fth-place nishers, respectively, in this category. On our overall innovation score, these countries earn similar marks: 23.7 and 23.8, respectively, which give them only midlist status. As this reveals and as is intended, Foundations does not identify innovation leaders (Intensity is a far better individual metric for that), but Foundations does identify countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, that are ripe for more domestic and inward investment and those such as India, Indonesia and the Phil-ippines that must address their foundations to make the case for additional investments.Argentina Australia Austria Belgium Brazil Canada Chile China Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hong Kong Hungary Iceland India Indonesia Ireland Israel Italy Japan Kuwait Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Malaysia Mexico Netherlands New Zealand Norway Philippines Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Qatar Russia Saudi Arabia Singapore Slovak Republic South Africa South Korea Spain Sweden Switzerland Taiwan, China Thailand Turkey Ukraine UAE United Kingdom United StatesEvery business depends on some sort of infrastructure, and this category measures those capabilities.5.80 5.73 1.80 5.76 4.15 4.96 0.98 1.94 4.61 8.09 8.57 45 7:14 AM46 ONE POLICY POWERS THE PHILIPPINES (SEE \"SWEET SOURCE OF POWER,\" PAGE 79). policy & Stability Scandinavia maintains the control that contributes to successFor the second year, Finland comes out on top of our Policy and Stability category.

What's more, Denmark nishes high in this category overall, coming in second, as it did in 2012. This category\u2014only in its second year on the Scorecard\u2014combines a range of government-related factors, including political stability and gov-ernment effectiveness. So our results indicate world-leading stability from the governments in Finland and Denmark. New Zealand, which moved up from fth in 2012 to third this year, also demon-strates strong governmental leadership.

Unfortunately for Russia, it landed on the bottom of this category this year and last. China also ranks near the bottom, coming in seventh from last for 2012 and 2013\u2014rating poorly in each component of Policy and Stability. For the most part, countries landed in roughly the same spots on this scale for this year and last. For example, the United States ranked 19th this year and 20th in 2012. Although the United States scores reasonably well in most of the components, it fl ounders in \"political stability and absence of violence/terrorism.\" The United Kingdom ranked just one step higher, faltering in the same component. Several other European countries also bunch up in the middle of this category. For instance, Germany placed 15th in 2012 and again this year. France nishes 22nd this year, falling back from its 19th-place ranking in 2012. Spain lands even farther down the list, nishing at 29th this year and last. As the last category used in our Scorecard, Policy and Stability indi-cates the breadth of factors required to succeed in biotechnology. The fun-damental elements range from scien-ti c discoveries to societal stability. A country might excel in some and fail in others. In order to truly succeed in this complicated eld, however, a country must perform powerfully across many categories. To explore the details be-hind the Scorecard analysis, be sure\u2014as mentioned above\u2014to review our Methods (page 65). But for now, turn the page to see how countries around the world stacked up on our overall innovation Scorecard.Argentina AustraliaAustriaBelgiumBrazilCanadaChileChinaCzech RepublicDenmarkEstoniaFinlandFranceGermanyGreeceHong K ongHungar yIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIrelandIsraelI t aiw an, ChinaThailandTurkeyUkraineUAEUnited KingdomUnited St a tes Luxembourg Mala y sia Mexico Netherlands New Zealand Nor w a y Philippines Poland Portugal Puerto Rico Q ata r Russia Saudi Arabia Singapore Slov ak Republic South Africa South Korea S pa i n Sweden Switzerland T aiw an, China Thailand Turkey Ukraine UAE United Kingdom 9.34 5.40 2.92 9.19 9.65 9.03 1.42 6.46 7.15 2.55 3.34 1.28 5.80 7.97 7.81 Philippines Philippines Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia Ukraine Ukraine D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 47 4/3/13 8:19 AM48 The United States and Denmark, nishing rst and second on this year's Scorecard, clinch a three-year run of leading our overall results in that order. In fact, four of the ve top countries\u2014the two leaders plus Finland and Singapore\u2014also placed in last year's top ve. Only third-place nisher Switzerland is new to the top ve. While reviewing the overall Scorecard, keep in mind that it is the product of a collection of averages and totals. As a quick summary: Each country received a score in six categories\u2014IP, Intensity, Enterprise Support, Education/Workforce, Foundations, and Policy and Stability\u2014that each contained a set of components. Based on 0-10 scores, for lowest to highest, we averaged the component scores to determine the category score. The overall innovation score represents a simple sum of the category averages, indexed to a score from 0-50. The normalization involved in calculating the category and overall scores considers each component and each category on equal weighting. In short, this Scorecard gives equal importance to a business friendly environment, public biotechnology companies per capita, PhD graduates in life sciences per capita and every other component of the categories. In addition, any gaps in the individual components were ignored in calculating the averages for each category. Beyond the top of the overall Scorecard, many other factors deserve attention. For instance, the United Kingdom slipped into this year's top ten. To accommodate that U.K. climb, Ireland slipped from eighth in 2012 to 11th this year. Even more than the United Kingdom, the Netherlands re-ally shot up the chart this year, moving from 17th in 2012 to 12th on this year's Scorecard. In addition, the United Arab Emirates\u2014a newcomer to the list\u2014placed 40th, just behind China and right in front of Russia. The UAE also earns the honor of being the top Gulf state on the list, ahead of Qatar at 42nd, Saudi Arabia at 45th and Kuwait at 53rd. Although we print the list of top-to-bottom overall nishers, we urge you to explore the trees in this forest. A country's place on the overall Scorecard does not neces-sarily refl ect its capabilities in every way. Despite winning in the overall score, the United States took the top spot in only two categories, IP and Enterprise Support. Denmark won for Intensity, Iceland led the way for Education/Work-force, and Finland continues its dominance in Foundations, also topping the chart in Policy and Stability. Also notice that Thailand and Saudi Arabia score highly in Education/Workforce. This refl ects the strong desire of their students to return home following foreign doctoral studies. Other countries, such as Austria, can focus on their strength in Foundations and Policy and Stability, while directing attention to lling areas of relative weakness, such as Education/Workforce and Enterprise Support. Even countries at the top of the overall list still need work. For example, the United States continues to place poorly in Policy and Stability. Each year, the global competition refl ected in the Scienti c American Worldview Scorecard grows more erce. The list of countries it documents continually expands. Some of the new countries, such as the UAE and Qatar, may push others toward the bottom. Indeed, volatility is seen throughout the Scorecard, as some countries rise to the top and others tumble toward the bottom. How did your country score this year? What can it do to move up on next year's Scorecard? While basketball lovers want to \"be like Mike\"\u2014the iconic line about Michael Jordan that emerged from a 1990s Gatorade commercial and soared to everyday usage\u2014countries aspiring to succeed in biotechnology want to be like Finland, and you will see why in just a few pages.

Among the top- ve countries on the overall innovation scores\u2014the United States, Denmark, Switzerland, Finland and Singapore, in order from rst through fth\u2014only Switzerland is a newcomer, bumping Sweden farther down on the list. Over-all, these countries earned innovation scores of 37.6, 35.7, 31.1, 30.7 and 30.4. Not surprisingly, these countries also win most of the categories. This year, the United States holds onto rst place, but Denmark comes within less than two points of the U.S. score. Even so, that's a wider gap than in 2012, when the United States held off Denmark by less than one point. These countries, however, hold a fairly comfortable lead over third-place Switzerland, which is four points be-hind Denmark. A roughly seven-point gap separates the United States from Finland and Singapore. Ironically, the United States performs the worst in the most hard-fought category: Policy and Stability. In this category, the United States lags more than 20 percent behind the category winner, Finland. The other countries in the top ve, however, all earned scores within about four percent of each other in this category. Likewise, Denmark\u2014second-place nisher overall\u2014really stumbles in our Enterprise Support category, earning a score that lags behind the United States by nearly 50 percent. In fact, in every one of our categories, one of the top- ve countries performs poorly. In IP protection, Singapore scores 30 percent lower than the category-leading United States. In Intensity, Finland fl ounders more than 90 percent behind Denmark, which won this category. In Education/Workforce, Singapore scores more than 50 percent behind Iceland, which earns the best score in that category. UNDERLYING TURMOIL IN THE TOP FIVE Finally, in Foundations, Singapore also nishes more than 20 percent behind category-leading Finland. This top- ve analysis indicates that a country can falter in one category and still nish high up on the Scienti c American Worldview Scorecard. What's more, a country can even struggle in two categories, like Singapore does this year, and still compete at the top. None of our top- ve countries, howev-er, struggles signi cantly in more than two categories. In fact, only Singapore really struggles in two categories. For the most part, a country must build balanced biotechnology skills and ca-pabilities to take a top-notch position. The scores bunch up some just be- hind the top ve. For example, Sweden scores 29.79 for sixth place, breath-ing down the necks of Singapore and Finland. Then, a strong overall score of 25.13 only pushes Hong Kong to 20th on the overall board. So, a tight cluster of scores lies just outside of the top ve, which puts many coun-tries in a position to make a move up the ladder, possibly by improving in just one category or even in a couple of components. Even some of the countries at the very top falter dramatically in fundamental areas Denmark united states Switzerland Finland Singapore Among the bottom- ve countries on this year's overall score, only one\u2014the Philippines\u2014is returning from such a position last year. In fact, two of the ve countries at the bottom of our list are making their debut appearances: Kuwait and Puerto Rico. The fourth country in this bottom group, Latvia, is only making its second appearance. All of these countries score far lower than the leaders. Speci cally, Thailand lands at the bottom of our scorecard, with a score of 8.1. Kuwait lifts slightly from the bottom with a 10.9. Moving up to a score of 11.0, Puerto Rico nishes third from last. The Philippines and Latvia receive relatively similar scores of 11.6 and 12.0, respectively, to ll out the bottom ve. Overall, the NEWCOMERS POPULATE MOST OF THE BOTTOM FIVE A long and hard climb exposes challenges and openings INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INTENSITY ENTERPRISE SUPPORT EDUCATION/WORKFORCE FOUNDATIONS POLICY & STABILITY PhilippinesLatvia Puerto Rico Kuwait Thailand bottom- ve countries make a cluster even tighter than the top ve. Here, less than four points separates all of these countries. For the most part, none of these nations scores well in any category. The exception goes to the Philippines, which earns a 6.84 in IP protection. A few other performances of note ap-pear, including scores of 5.80 and 5.71 in Policy and Stability for Latvia and Puerto Rico, respectively. In addition, Kuwait receives a 5.73 in Enterprise Support. Despite pointing out these relative high spots, these countries score poorly across the categories in general. On the whole, these nations receive little good news. For instance, Thailand takes a score of 0.02 in Intensity\u2014the category that most directly measures a country's efforts in building biotechnology innovation. The other countries in the bottom ve, however, might fare just as poorly in Intensity, but we lack the data to ana-lyze them in this category. The Educa-tion/Workforce category also delivers bad news for these countries. Both the Philippines and Kuwait collect scores of zero in this category. Even Puerto Rico, with the best Education/Work-force score among this group, only gets a 1.45. The take-home message for these countries is easy: Improvement in vir-tually any biotechnology-related area will improve your position on future Scorecards. A bottom- ve country can simply pick a spot in our analysis and develop a system or process of improvement. For instance, since these countries perform so poorly in our Education/Workforce category, that makes an appealing target. As a speci c example, Kuwait earns a zero in the component of \"R&D personnel per thousand employment,\" making this an area in Education/Workforce worth addressing. The same is true for Puerto Rico, which receives only a 1.45 in this component. These potential openings for the bottom- ve countries can be exploit-ed. Furthermore, the tight bunching at the bottom means that small improve-ments might be enough to rise out of this group. Will your country be the one to make the leap that pushes it up next year's Scorecard? ON TOP DEMANDS KEEPING UP WITH TECHNOLOGY (SEE \"A MACHINE TO CAPTURE COMPLEXITY,\" PAGE 26). AUSTRALIA CANADADENMARKFINLAND NEW ZEALANDSINGAPORESWEDENSWITZERLANDUNITED STATESUNITED KINGDOM 5 YEARS OF RANKING BIOTECHNOLOGY This year's Scorecard refl ects a vast and volatile industry For the past ve years, the United States has claimed the top position overall on our Scienti c American Worldview Scorecard. However, the leading contend- ers are edging closer. Our data show that even though these individual challengers may lose and gain ground from year to year, as a group, they seem to be closing in on the U.S. This is just one example of the overall trends we seek to capture in our annual Scorecard. To continue to improve our analysis, we've made some changes over the years. For one thing, our list of countries keeps growing. Where it made sense, we've also incorpo-rated new metrics now and then, often to better evaluate the included countries. In order to accommodate these al-terations, we have normalized each year's data to accurate-ly compare our results over the past ve years. Speci cally, we normalized the overall innovation scores, from lowest to highest, to a range of 0-50 (2009 data were on a scale of 0-5). The results for data from 2009 through 2013 reveal how each country changed relative to itself and others.

Just knowing a country's score does not reveal its rank. As the graphs of the top ten by score (top) and rank (bottom) show, the ranking proves much more volatile than the scores. For instance, Israel receives relatively stable scores, but its ranking keeps dropping, more or less, over time. On the other hand, Australia's score jumps back and forth, but its ranking maintains a roughly improving trajec-tory. Even Germany\u2014which consistently held 16th place for the rst four years of the Scorecard\u2014shows ups and downs in its overall score. Plus, even though its score dropped a bit this year, Germany moved up to 14th spot overall. Among the top ten, only the U.S. and Denmark uphold consistent ranks, despite their changing scores. Finland also displays a top-ten trend worth noting, which is its general upward mobility. Likewise, the United Kingdom appears to be climbing in general, although a couple dips in its ranking cloud that perception. For now, the overall volatility makes it dif cult to ac- curately assess a nation's trend\u2014up or down\u2014in most cases. As we collect more data, though, we will create an increasingly precise picture of the evolution of biotechnol-ogy innovation around the world.20 25 30 25 2013 2012 Just knowing a country's score does not reveal its rank.

BEST-IN-CLASS COUNTRIES Some nations that ranked in the middle of our list have mastered certain key capabilities Just because a country ranks in the middle of our over-all Scorecard doesn't mean it hasn't shown excellence in a particular area. Take Mexico, for example. This nation has never nished higher than 33rd on our Scorecard, and this year it fell to 43rd. Still, Mexico leads the world in talent retention, with more of its U.S.-trained doctoral students want-ing to come home than anywhere else. Likewise, even though the Slo-vak Republic holds an average ve-year score of 29.8, it ranks third in Europe for providing venture capital (relative to its GDP). These countries remind us of the many factors that contribute to a healthy biotech in-dustry. In some cases, it also makes sense to look at a region, especially the EU, which contains many of the legacy pharmaceutical countries. It is therefore no surprise that the EU leads the world in pharmaceutical exports. With a population nearly twice the size of the U.S., the world's largest pharmaceutical market, the multi-market EU also leads in im-ports.

D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 55 4/3/13 5:39 PM56 BACTERIA MAKE A BANG IN ONE BIOTECH MARKET (SEE \"BEWARE OF BACTERIA BEARING DRUGS,\" PAGE 74). The number of U.S. public biotech companies keeps declining, going from 279 in our 2009 Scorecard to 216 this year\u2014 gures that represent scal years 2007 and 2011, respectively. Other countries, by contrast, saw their numbers increase. For instance, Israel's total public biotechnology companies rose from four to 14 over the same period. This example\u2014216 U.S. public companies versus 14 in Israel\u2014shows another trend: The United States is home to far more public biotechs than any other nation, as revealed by our comparison of 24 leading countries. Really assessing a country's public-company market requires a consideration of the market capitalization, which is the value of the combined shares that have been sold for all of the companies. This gure adds context to the number of public companies. For example, Australia, Sweden and the United Kingdom have seen increases in the number of their public companies, along with a rise in total market capital-ization. On the other hand, France has not seen signi cant growth in market capitalization as the number of its public companies has increased. This could be indicative of a poor climate for large public businesses, favoring the emergence of a larger number of smaller public rms. As with the raw number of public companies, the United States is the global leader in market capitalization. Even though the U.S. market capitalization has been dropping over the past few years, the market capitalization of public biotechs in the United States is nearly equal to the rest of the world combined. In the 2012 Scienti c American Worldview, we reported that biotechnology might be recovering from the effects of the global economic crisis, as possibly suggested by the increase in overall market capitalization for scal year 2010. Unfortunately, the data this year\u2014based on data for scal year 2011\u2014show a return to the general decline, with sev-eral interesting counter-examples. While the United States biotechnology market capitalization has been on a general decline since 2007, pulling down the global average due to its bulk, several countries have seen signi cant growth. The most dramatic increases in market capitalization for public biotechs continue to be in Australia, Denmark and the United Kingdom. Ireland has also seen dramatic growth, but its bio-technology market capitalization reported this year remains lower than it was in our 2009 issue. Given the lag in our data\u2014reporting on two-year-old scal stats\u2014a recovery might be underway, but we won't be able to assess that for a couple years.

This trade de cit arises in part from the huge increase in pharmaceutical imports to the United States\u2014nearly double\u2014during the period 2007-2010 versus 2003-2006. China and India also increased their pharmaceutical imports during these periods, but not by nearly as much. Conversely, Ireland reduced its imports by more than half. Germany and Singapore also decreased their pharmaceutical imports over this time, although not by as much. While reading these import and export variations, keep in mind that one of the important outcomes of innovation is the ability to generate a trade surplus. Producing valuable products enables a country's compa-nies to sell them globally, whereas lack of domestic production requires import. An advantage of global sales is that domestic companies, workers and governments (via taxes) can pro t from the ability to tap a larger market. A downside of extensive import is that it depletes foreign currency, which limits domestic ability to purchase other needed goods, and the local economy is unable to enjoy spillover effects of the economic activity as the revenues and wages are realized in other countries. As \"Balancing Acts\" shows, many countries import pharmaceuticals worth more than they export. For example, Russia imports drugs worth more than 18 times the value of what it exports. Even Japan's pharmaceuti-cal imports are worth more than twice as much as its exports. Overall, most countries are net importers. On the other hand, the European Union, China, India and Singapore are net exporters. The pie charts for \"Top Export- ers\" and \"Top Importers\" dive into the distribution. Among the top exporters, the European Union is the largest destination for drugs from the United States, and the United States is the largest destination for drugs from the European Union. China and India differ in their destinations; China's largest consumer is the European Union (which has substan-tially greater imports than the United States), and India's largest consumer is the United States. On imports, most countries import most of their drugs from the European Union. The largest single source of drugs in the European Union is the United States, but inter-EU trade ac-counts for a much larger value (data not shown). Roughly 90 percent of Russian drugs are imported from the European Union. With so few trading partners, Russia might be missing out on competitive pricing opportunities. Nonetheless, Russia is not alone in looking for a pharmaceutical-trade balance, because even the United States deals with a de cit. thailandTHE INS & OUTS OF THE DRUG TRADE BALANCING ACTS ($MM) United St a tes Exports imports brazilrussia mexico T aiw an South Korea Singapore Philippines Mala y sia Indonesia India Jap an EU 50,000100,000150,000200,000250,000300,000china D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 58 4/4/13 ChinaEUIndiaJap KoreaT aiw anThailandUnited St $8.8japan $5.4 D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 4/4/13 AM60 RUSSIA BUILDS BIOTECH BACKING (SEE \"A RUSSIAN FIRST,\" PAGE 77). VENTURE CAPITAL IN EUROPE Romania takes an unexpected lead Venture capital originated in the United States, and the bulk of VC investments remain based there. But how much VC exists in other countries? This chart (compiled from data from the European Private Equity and Venture Capital Association) shows the VC investment activity in Europe, as indexed by each nation's GDP, and the VC investments made in small companies. Interestingly, the leaders come from a diverse set of countries: Romania, Denmark, the Slovak Republic and France. In particular, Austria Belgium Bulgaria Cyprus Czech Republic Germany Denmark Estonia Spain Finland France United Kingdom Greece Hungary Ireland Italy Lithuania Luxembourg Latvia Malta Netherlands Poland Portugal Romania Sweden Slovenia Slovak Republic EUfew biotechnology experts would be likely to pick Romania as the European leader for relative VC investment. More-over, the proportion of VC in small companies shows an in-teresting trend: In the larger economies, such as Germany, the United Kingdom and France, seed and start-up VC accounts for roughly half of their overall VC investments. In smaller economies, such as Lithuania, Poland, Greece and Hungary, the proportion of VC investments in small com-panies is closer to 100 percent of the total investments. It is important to consider that small companies tend to take smaller investments than larger ones, so even a 50 percent ratio of small-company investment probably indicates that a larger number of small companies receive investments than do medium to large ones.

For 1990-2012, this table shows the number of papers in HIV basic research and HIV drug discovery that list researchers based in African countries. South Africa leads both categories, with 3,921 and 57 articles in HIV-related basic research and drug discovery, respectively. All of the countries produced far more basic-research articles than ones related to drug discovery. In part, this makes perfect sense, because basic research covers many more topics for potential exploration, from cell biology and physiology to epidemiology and social sciences. Consequently, some coun-tries put far more effort into basic research. For instance, researchers from Uganda appeared as authors on 1,058 HIV-related articles on basic research but only on seven related to drug discovery. The low relative drug-discovery activity, however, is not a negative indicator, because both basic research and applied research are important for innovation. Many very important innovations have emerged as unexpected tangents from basic re-search, so Morocco's position as being relatively strong on applied research and relatively weak on basic research might deliver fewer innovations in the long term than the converse.

That's how much money the United States generated in pharmaceuti- cal sales in 2010. It was more than one-quarter of the drug sales for the entire world. Plus, the U.S. drug sales outstripped its nearest competitor, China, by nearly 50 percent. What's more, the U.S. outsold third-place Japan by three times. What does this reveal about biotechnology? In short, pharmaceutical revenues portray the overall climate for biotech-nology revenues. Innovation can bring many things\u2014public health, products for domestic needs, employment, diplomatic leverage and more\u2014but one of the most important outputs is cash. Revenues enable companies to pay workers high wages, and governments can tax these revenues and salaries to deliver public services. So pharma-ceutical sales serve as a surrogate for measuring biotechnology. The relative immaturity of the biotechnology indus-try means that sales are concentrated in a smaller set of countries. One of the most prominent features of this chart is the stand-ing of China. China's pharmaceutical revenues exceed the sum of the ve leading European nations.

Although China takes second place among the countries, P zer beats it. Likewise, Amgen's revenues exceed the phar-maceutical revenues from all of the European countries, save Germany. Even one drug can tell a tale, especially if that drug is P zer's cholesterol-battling, blockbuster\u2014Lipitor. This drug's annual sales provide perspective on India's pro-generic policy. (We covered Novartis's patent dispute with India in \"A Message from India\" in Scienti c American Worldview in 2009, and the dispute still has not been resolved.) By offering weak pat-ent protection for drugs, India's policy favors generic manufacturing, which has put its companies into a \"race to the bottom,\" where they increas-ingly compete on price to sell drugs invented elsewhere. The negative consequences of weak patent protec-tion are clear: 2011 sales for a single innovative drug\u2014Lipitor\u2014generated 27 percent more revenue than the entire Indian pharmaceutical industry. That metric backs up the bene ts of innovation! D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 62 4/4/13 12:28 AMWORLDVIEW SCORECARD 63 Upon closer inspection, China tumbles from the top In fl at-out R&D expenditures, China outspends most of the world. Although the scorecard measures research expenditures and the number of research workers, these gross metrics warrant a deeper look. The charts below reveal overall R&D spending plus the support available for each worker. China excels in one and falters in the other. Here, R&D is measured using purchasing power parity (PPP)\u2014a calculation that attempts to adjust for differences in cost-of-living between countries and therefore is more representative of the relative resources available to each R&D worker. R&D workers are counted as full-time equiva-lents (FTE) rather than as the actual number of workers, which adjusts for situations where some workers might work part-time and thereby bias the results. In gross R&D expenditures, the United States would likely lead, but it is not included here. Consequently, China takes the top spot, followed by Japan, the large European economies and South Korea. No one, however, follows China closely on this metric. Nonetheless, evaluating the R&D budget per employee tells a different story. China falls to the bottom quarter of the list, and Japan remains near the top, behind Singapore, Switzerland, Sweden and Germany. Because the R&D expen-ditures are normalized for PPP, lower wages do not explain China's reduced investment per employee. In a nutshell, China simply invests less per employee, even on an adjusted scale. *Source: UNESCO 2011 or latest dataArgentina AustraliaAustriaBelgiumCanadaChileChinaCzech i nSwedenSwitzerlandTurkeyUnited KingdomDISSECTING R&D DOLLARS .05 .10 .15 .20 R&D SPEND GERD ($MM PPP)R&D SPEND PER R&D FTE D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 63 4/4/13 12:29 AM64 From a country perspective, it's not much of a battle for the leading number of biotechnology articles. In 2011, the United States ran away from the competition. In short, the United States is the Usain Bolt of biotechnology\u2014completely trashing the competition, at least in terms of publications. In fact, researchers in the United States published nearly 500 percent more articles than China, which came in second. What's more, the United States published more than 600 percent more articles than the United Kingdom, which came in third. The impact of biotechnology publishing, though, cannot be exposed with an article count alone. The number of cita-tions reveals the extent of an article's reach. So we present the \"Top 25 Institutions Publishing in Biotechnology,\" which provides the number of articles, the product of that number and citations and average citations, which is calculated by the number of citations divided by the number of articles. In fact, the last metric\u2014average citations\u2014tells the most about the interest in the publications. The awards for the highest average citations go to the University of Penn-sylvania, the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the MD Anderson Cancer Center, all tied for rst at 9. Then, other U.S.-based institutions take the next ve spots. The United Kingdom's Oxford and Cambridge Universities come in next in a ve-way tie with three other U.S. institutions.

International patent protection: 1960-2005. Research Policy 37(4),761-766 (2008) consists of the unweighted sum of five measures: patentable inventions, membership in interna-tional treaties, duration of protection, enforcement mechanisms and restric-tions (e.g., compulsory licensing). Despite its 2008 publications, this still serves as the leading global index of IP protection.INTENSITY To assess a country's overall efforts to drive biotechnology innovation, we merge five components into a measurement called Intensity. The components are: \"public bio-technology company employees per capita,\" \"public biotechnology com-pany revenues per US$ billion GDP,\" \"biotech patents per total patents filed with PCT\" (where PCT is the Patents Cooperation Treaty), \"value added of knowledge- and technology-intensive industries\" and \"business expendi-tures on biotechnology R&D.\" To reinforce the contributions of absolute over relative measures, the \"public companies per million popula-tion\" was removed from the Intensity section, because the other metrics\u2014\"public company employees per capita\" and \"public company revenues per US$ billion GDP\"\u2014do a sufficient job of expressing the relative level of activity in a country. In addition, \"business expenditures on R&D,\" which had been part of the Foundations section, was moved to the Intensity section where it replaced the \"biotechnology R&D as percentage of total expenditures on R&D\" metric. Several of the components of the Intensity metric rely on public biotech-nology company data that come from company disclosures and published information (Huggett, B., Hodgson, J. & L\u00e4hteenm\u00e4ki, R. Public biotech 2010\u2014the numbers. Nature Biotechnology 29, 585-591 (2011), and company dis-closures). For the \"public biotechnol-ogy company employees per capita\" component we divided the employee counts by the 2011 mid-year popula-tion as sourced from the US Census Bureau International Database. For \"public company revenues per US$ billion GDP,\" we used the 2011 GDP as sourced from the IMF World Eco-nomic Outlook Database. The data for \"biotech patents per total patents filed with PCT\" and \"business expenditures on biotechnology R&D\" came from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). \"Value added of knowledge- and technology-intensive industries\" was sourced from NSF Science and Engineer-ing Indicators, 2012.ENTERPRISE SUPPORT The En-terprise Support metric consists of an average of four components. We derived a \"business friendly environ-ment\" measurement from: Doing Business 2013, World Bank and the International Finance Corporation, which surveyed local experts on a syn-thetic business case. This approach includes some limitations because it relies on a specific business of a specified size and refers to conducting business in a country's largest city, with the exception of certain countries such as China. The \"biotechnology venture capital\" component depends on measurements from the OECD. The \"venture capital availability\" score comes from an index based on an international survey (Schwab, K. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2011-2012. World Economic Forum, 2011). The last component, \"capital availability,\" was derived from the Milken Institute Capital Access Index.EDUCATION/WORKFORCE This cat-egory consists of five components. For \"post-secondary science graduates per capita,\" we used UNESCO figures, divided by the 2011 mid-year popula-tion as sourced from the US Census Bureau International Database. For \"PhD graduates in the life sciences per capita\" and \"R&D personnel per thousand employment,\" we turned to OECD figures. To create a metric for \"talent retention,\" we calculated the percentage of a country's doc-toral recipients who did not express definite intentions to stay in the United States following graduation there, as reported by the US National Science Foundation. So a lower score in tal-ent retention means that more PhD graduates did express a desire to stay in the United States, which creates \"brain drain\" for the home country of those graduates.FOUNDATIONS Four components make up Foundations. Data from the OECD lie behind \"R&D business expenditures per GDP.\" UNESCO data are used for \"government support of R&D per GDP.\" For data on \"infra-structure quality,\" we turned to the World Economic Forum (Schwab, K. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2011-2012. World Economic Forum, 2011), which uses an international survey to produce its index. Last, we derived a component called \"innovation and entrepreneurship opportunity\" from the 2012 Legatum Prosperity Index.POLICY AND STABILITY To assess the policy and stability of each country we used the following measures from the World Bank's 2011 World Gover-nance Indicators: and absence of violence/terrorism\" measures perceptions of the likelihood that the government will be destabilized or overthrown by unconstitutional or violent means. \"Government effectiveness\" measures perceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures. \"Regulatory quality\" measures perceptions of the ability of the government to formulate and implement sound policies and regulations that permit and promote private sector development. \"Rule of law\" measures perceptions of confi-dence in and adherence to the rules of society, particularly the quality of contract enforcement, property rights, the police and the courts, as well as the likelihood of crime and violence. METHODS The data for each category of the Scorecard arises from public and/or private sources, which are listed here along with additional analytical details. D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 65 4/4/13 12:41 AMSPONSOR PROFILE: MALAYSIA One of the key drivers in propelling the na-tion towards becoming a high income and fully developed economy by 2020 lies in identifying high growth eco-nomic areas. Backed by a solid history and track record, this has always been a Malaysian forte. The growing robust agri- cultural industry of the country and its countless agriculture economic activities has not only spurred Malaysia to greater heights but has also been a lever-age for growth in biotechnology. As part of Prime Minister Najib's drive to propel Malaysia into a pros-perous, inclusive and sustainable economy by 2020, The Bioeconomy Transformation Programme (BTP) was launched in October 2012. BTP is based on biotechnology's poten-tial to cut across various industries, namely agbiotech (agriculture biotechnology), biomedical (health-care biotechnology) and bioindus-trial (industrial biotechnology) BTP is a platform provided by the Malaysian government for the private sector to channel and maximize commercial opportuni-ties in bio-based industries. It is a continuation of implementation strategies under the National Bio-technology Policy (NBP), Malay-sia's biotechnology Master Plan (2005-2020), championed by the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation and to be implemented by the Malaysian Biotechnology Corporation Sdn Bhd (BiotechCorp). According to BiotechCorp chief executive of cer Dato' Dr Mohd Nazlee Kamal, \"Malaysia was the rst in South-east Asia and second in Asia after China to kickstart its bioeconomy. Through the BTP, the government and leading industry \"BTP strategy is seen as a catalyst to further enhance the Economic Transformation Programme. /T_h rough the BTP , the government and leading industry players will work in tandem to set national goals for the application of biotechnology in agriculture production, industrial manufacturing and human health, put in place the structural conditions required and develop necessary mechanisms to ensure that policy can /f_l exibly adapt to new opportunities\" \u2014PRIME MINISTER NAJIB CURRENT ENTRY POINT PROJECTS (EPPS) & TRIGGER PROJECTS ( ) AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRIALHEALTHCAREBio-based farm inputs High value bioingredientsHigh value food varieties BiosimilarsDrug discovery & preclinical servicesMolecular screening & diagnosticsStem cells & regenerative medicine BiomaterialsIndustrial bio inputsBio-based chemicals20 TRIGGER PROJECTS & 10 EPPSLeveraging on the biomedical sector to ensure sustainable growth for the Malaysian bioeconomy players will work in tandem to set national goals for the applica-tion of biotechnology in agriculture production, industrial manufactur-ing and human health, put in place the structural conditions required and develop necessary mechanisms to ensure that policy can fl exibly adapt to new opportunities.\" BTP's strategy is seen as a cata- lyst to further enhance the Eco-nomic Transformation Programme. As a base, BTP has been projected to increase the Malaysian Gross National Income (GNI) to RM3.6(USD 1.2) billion in 2020, with total invest-ment reaching RM10 (USD 3.2)billion from existing 10 Entry Point Projects and 20 Trigger Projects. Biomedical has been identi ed as one of the critical sectors in supporting the implementation of the BTP. Out of the 20 BTP Trigger Projects identi ed, four are in the biomedical eld: biosimilars, drug discovery and pre-clinical services, ENRICHING THE NATION, SECURING THE FUTURE D_Scorecard_32-61.indd 66 4/4/13 12:32 AMBASIC RESEARCH BiotechCorp will escalate efforts to explore more R&D collaborations between multinational/global com-panies with local universi-ties/research institutes. DEVELOPMENTAL RESEARCH This encompasses clinical research and R&D for prod-uct development, e.g., proto-types and proof-of-concept for medical devices and pilot plants. The clinical re-search is a crucial element in this endeavor. Clinical Research Center (CRC) and the newly-established Clinical Research Malaysia (CRM) have successfully attracted about 300 clinical trials to Malaysia from 2011 to 2012. In line with the goal set for CRM, as part of \"NKEA Healthcare - EPP 2: Creating a supportive ecosystem to grow clinical research,\" CRM is expected to attract 1,000 clinical trials to Malaysia . MANUFACTURING Pharma, biopharma, medical devices, IVD - BiotechCorp will continue to intensify efforts within these sectors, with the new initiative coined as the \"BioMedical Clusters.\" COMMERCIALIZATION BiotechCorp will intensify efforts in commercializa-tion of products; however, emphasis would also be put on commercialisation of services, e.g CRO, CMO, as well as Care Delivery, which would ultimately lead to an increase in medical tourism in Malaysia. VACCINE INITIATIVE An integrated Malaysian Vaccine Programme has been proposed consisting of multiple Manufacturing and R&D-based initiatives. This presents an opportunity for local and international partners to be involved in this comprehensive vaccine programme to meet Malay-sia's needs. ENHANCING BIOMEDICAL FOR MALAYSIA'S BIOECONOMY E orts are being made to attract and secure high impact investment, both foreign and domestic. A new and more innovative approach will complete the value chain for the biomedical biotechnology industry in Malaysia in the following areas: U.S. APRIL 2012 CANADA 2009 EUROPE SEPTEMBER 2010 FINLAND JUNE 2012 RUSSIA JUNE 2012 CHINA JUNE 2007 MALAYSIA OCTOBER 2012 AUSTRALIA 2007 NEW ZEALAND NOVEMBER 2007 molecular screening and diagnostics, and stem cells and regenerative medicine. This complements the existing Entry Point Projects for Malaysian Pharma, Clinical Trials and Medical Devices in Malaysia. Moving forward, BTP seeks to lever-age on Malaysia's attractiveness in the biomedical sector and to include more private sector participation to ensure the sustainable growth of the country's bioeconomy.EMERGING TREND: Countries Establishing Bioeconomy Initiatives Bioeconomy to contribute to a global average of 2.7% to GDP by 2030 (OECD estimates) www.biotechcorp.com.my 4/2/13 EMILY W ALTZ ILLUSTRATIONS BY Deanna Staffo Sowing Solutions Around the world, more than 870 million people live with hunger .

YOU CAN'T JUST SIT AT THE UNIVERSITY AND CRY OUT FOR POLICY CHANGE.\" \u2014ROFINA YASMIN OTHMAN YASMIN OTHMAN A scientist steps out of her comfort zone to help her country succeed Like most scientists, plant virologist Rofina Yasmin Othman at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lum - pur loves getting buried in her research. But un - like most scientists, she has stepped out of the comfort of her academic lab to make a mark on national science policy. Over the past six years she has helped craft grassroots biotechnology legislation for Malaysia in a way that might help scientists there flourish. \"Good science rests on good regula - tions,\" she says. \"I was pushing for a proper regulatory framework.\" Until a few years ago, Malaysia had no review system, no guidance and no regulations for biotechnol - ogy development. \"Without that it is very difficult for local scientists to do work because no one wants to take on the liability,\" says Mahaletchumy Arujanan, executive director of the Malaysian Biotechnology Informa - tion Centre in Petaling Jaya. Scien - tists didn't know what they could and couldn't do, and private-sector play - ers in other countries were hesitant to work with them, she says. Malaysia in 2005 outlined its first formal biotech strategy with the pas - sage of the National Biotechnology Policy. But more specific legislation was needed to implement it and steer the country's bioeconomy. That's where Yasmin Othman stepped in. She got her first taste of national pol - icy when she was asked to serve as an adviser for the drafting of Malaysia's Biosafety Act, which would govern the release and import of living modified organisms. The Act proved controversial and strong criticism from industry delayed its implemen - tation. Yasmin Othman pushed her government to consult the private sector more, and eventually succeeded in bringing all the parties to the same meeting table\u2014the turning point for the implementation of the Act. From Plants to Policies While working on the Biosafety Act in 2009, Yasmin Othman was ap - proached by the deputy secretary general at the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation about taking on the role of undersecretary of the Ministry's biotechnology divi - sion. It was a position that other sci - entists had turned down. \"It is a hot seat where the government puts a lot of pressure to see the return of invest - ment,\" says Arujanan. \"Most scien - tists don't want to be involved with grassroots policy. Everyone wants to be in their comfort zone.\" Indeed, Yasmin Othman's first thought about the job offer was \"no,\" she says. \"I'd been in academics my whole career and it was too drastic a change.\" But after striking a deal that would allow her to fill the role while continuing her research and teach - ing at the university, she accepted. \"Scientists have to be more proactive. You can't just sit at the university and cry out for policy change,\" she says. \"I saw that you have to be involved at the highest level to make the changes.\" Besides, the policy she would be working on would directly affect her research at the university. For years she had been studying plant viruses as the cause of plant disease and as vec - tors in transgenic plants for the pro - duction of biopharmaceuticals. She was also working toward what could be Malaysia's first field trial of a biotech crop: a stress-tolerant banana. Both of these areas require guidance from the government, and she wanted it done right. \"Scientists like professor Yasmin\u2014they feel they must be the change agent,\" says Arujanan. As undersecretary, Yasmin Oth - man proposed to the Ministry a strat - egy to make biotechnology a driver of Malaysia's agriculture, healthcare, energy and manufacturing indus - tries. She emphasized using Malay - sia's biodiversity in a sustainable way. \"Malaysia is a very green country with very limited space,\" she says. \"There's not going to be an increase in arable land and we're not cutting down more forests. So what we have has to pro - duce more.\" The plan she proposed, called the Bioeconomy Initiative Ma - laysia, launched in 2011. While at the Ministry she also helped launch the country's first bioethics council to provide advice to the government and resolve national bioethics issues. Connecting Science To Society It was, to say the least, a challenge to balance serving the Ministry, working at the university and caring for her two sons, now ages 10 and 13. On a typical day, she would attend meetings at the Ministry from 9am to 5pm, meet with a student over lunch, do her academic reading during her one-hour com - mutes and scurry home in time to put her kids to bed. She taught two classes a week after hours at the university and traveled frequently for the Ministry. It was also a big change from the flexible academic schedule she had been on for nearly 30 years. Yasmin be - came interested in virus research as an undergraduate in the early 1980s at the University of Surrey in the United King - dom. \"I had a very inspirational lecturer F_Profiles.indd 69 4/2/13 12:58 PM70 BY EMILY W ALTZ on virology named Michael Butler who would ask philosophical questions,\" Yasmin Othman says. She came to see viruses as not just simple structures, but something that influences the economy, health and the environment. After completing her PhD in 1994 at the John Innes Center in the United Kingdom, she joined the Uni - versity of Malaya as a lecturer and later a professor. Her most important papers came from her study of plant viruses as tools for the production of biopharmaceuticals, such as antibod - ies and antigens. \"There were not so many people in Malaysia looking at high value products from plants,\" says Jennifer Harikrishna, head of the Cen - tre for Research in Biotechnology for Agriculture at the University of Ma - laya. \"She pioneered that.\" Yasmin also studied banana genomics\u2014a natural fit at the university, where there is a 40-year history working with the fruit. After serving the Ministry, Yasmin Othman returned to the university in 2012 with a different perspective. As head of the health and translational medicine cluster, she now encourages academic projects that are aligned with the national strategy, and asks her colleagues to be more aware of their work's relevance to the econo - my. Above all, she can conduct her research with the confidence that her government's regulatory framework will support it. \"We took our time in getting regulations in place and I think we did a good job,\" she says. ADRIAN DUBOCK A public-private deal\u2014 and superhuman persistence\u2014 made Golden Rice possible In January 2000, European scien - tists unveiled in Science the first compelling example of a geneti - cally modified crop that could benefit the poor: a rice variety nutritionally enhanced with be - ta-carotene. The yellow-tinted rice, dubbed Golden Rice, could alleviate Vitamin A deficiency, which leads to blindness and death and is prevalent in poor, rice-dependent countries. The initial promise of Golden Rice, and the rocky path that followed, made global headlines. But few know the story of the manager who found a way for his corporation to develop this humanitarian crop and give it away for free. Adrian Dubock, a persistent and jolly Brit, was the global commercial biotechnology manager for London-based Zeneca Group in 2000, and saw Golden Rice as an opportunity for his company. Zeneca was interested in nutritional enhancement of crops and in using rice as a model crop. Golden Rice aligned with both of those inter - ests and, as Dubock saw it, offered a clear consumer benefit. F_Profiles.indd 70 4/2/13 3:43 PMWORLDVIEW PROFILES 71 But the inventors of Golden Rice, Peter Beyer and Ingo Potrykus, wanted to see their technology developed and donated to the poor\u2014not the most business-friendly plan. \"Both of us as university professors didn't have a clue how to proceed,\" says Beyer, a biology professor at the University of Freiburg in Germany. (Potrykus retired in 1999.) \"That's where Adrian stepped in.\" Dubock proposed a deal: Beyer and Potrykus would license their tech - nology for free to Zeneca, the company would support development, and all parties would contribute technologi - cal improvements. Zeneca, which in the midst of the negotiations became part of the newly formed Basel-based Syngenta, would have the sole right to commercial exploitation of the tech - nology, and would license it back to the professors for free for carefully de - fined humanitarian applications. The idea took some explaining. \"Adrian would go around within the company, convincing his colleagues,\" Beyer recalls. \"It was a major under - taking.\" Pros and Cons of Persistence The key was in separating commercial from humanitarian markets. Dubock classified humanitarian markets as those with 'resource-poor farmers' in 'developing countries' and de - fined those terms in detail. He then convinced the owners of patents that touched on Golden Rice to grant free licenses for the humanitarian aspects of the project. Later Dubock devel - oped a network of licensed public-sector collaborators in developing countries so that the technology could be donated with ease, and established a governance body called the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board. The cash - less deal was likely the first of its kind in agricultural biotech. \"Adrian was the architect of the structure that made everybody happy,\" says Beyer. Syngenta's scientists quickly made significant improvements to the tech - nology, and the Golden Rice group thought they were on their way. But more than a decade later, Golden Rice still isn't available to farmers. Suspicions of biotech crops, churned up largely by activists, have created years of regulatory delays in develop - ing countries. \"Here we are not per - ceived as good guys,\" says Beyer. \"We are the bad guys. You have reason for being exhausted.\" If Dubock is exhausted, it doesn't show. He possesses this tireless com - bination of outward joviality and inward persistence. After Syngenta in 2004 abandoned the commercial aspects of Golden Rice as being too small, Dubock says he convinced the company to spend an additional $1 million on the project to make it donatable and pay for field trails in the United States. After retiring from Syngenta in 2007, Dubock took an unpaid position on the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board, where he still fights for the rice. \"He is undaunted by opposition if he believes his mission is ethical,\" says David Jones, former head of busi - ness development at Syngenta and Dubock's direct boss there. \"He's very driven about things he cares about and is single-minded and persistent in his goals.\" But his persistence didn't always pay off in a corporate setting. \"Not everyone was happy with Adrian's ardor,\" says Jones. \"It's a commend - able characteristic but is noisy and uncompromising as well. There were some bruising encounters that prob - ably held him back.\" Dubock began his career in ro - denticides. For his first corporate job, he traveled extensively in Asia and the Middle East for British multinational Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) selling a rodent-control technique he invented. One Saturday night a colleague called to tell him that Egyp - tian officials were meeting that Mon - day in Cairo to discuss buying prod - ucts against rodents in the country's orange groves. Dubock broke into his office building on Sunday morning to get his passport, booked a flight on his credit card, and made the meeting. He returned with \u00a3 1 million. Benefits of Being Bulletproof At age 35, in 1985, he became the chief executive of ICI's Panamericana agrochemical business, and moved his young family to Guatemala City for four years. His territory included seven Central American countries, most of which were at war. He took bulletproof cars to work and changed his route daily. As ICI morphed to Zeneca and eventually Syngenta, Dubock always found an international role at the company. By the sunset years of his career, Dubock had worked in doz - ens of developing countries, and the experiences helped form in him a disdain for the injustices of life in im - poverished regions. \"I've always hated the idea of injustice,\" he says. \"It's the injustice of people who don't have self sufficiency in food and the injustice of blocking a technology for no sub - stantial reason. They come together in Golden Rice.\" After Syngenta abandoned com - mercial development of Golden Rice in 2004, Dubock convinced Jones, who had been supportive of his proj - ects, to add humanitarian donations \"I'VE ALWAYS HATED THE IDEA EMILY W ALTZ to his title. But two years later Jones retired, leaving Dubock exposed. \"I had a rather strange job,\" says Dubock. \"I was in the business de - velopment unit and mergers and ac - quisitions but I was increasingly do -ing humanitarian work. I felt I was in an exposed position because I was working in an area that the company didn't value very highly.\" His post-retirement move to the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board may not be lucrative, but it's prob - ably the most suitable for Dubock. Dogged zeal is exactly what it takes to continue pursuing something like Golden Rice in the face of so many obstacles. CLIVE JAMES The go-to source for biotechnology crop data There's only one place to find comprehensive glob - al data on biotech crops, and it's not the United Nations's Food and Agri - culture Organization or the World Bank or any national agen - cy. It's a tiny not-for-profit called the International Service for the Acquisi - tion of Agri-Biotech Applications, or ISAAA. This group serves as the go-to source for everyone from government officials to journalists. Behind the data is one very connected scientist: Clive James. A plant pathologist with a more than 40-year career in global agricul - ture and development, James believes that biotechnology is a viable part of the solution to food insecurity in poor countries, and that the best way to en - courage the adoption of genetically modified (GM) crops in those areas is by sharing knowledge about how the technology is being used globally. The task his harder than you'd think. James has spent decades building an extensive network of international fact finders who supply him with numbers on an annual basis; usually more than one estimate for any one data point. It's a tough task when each country comes up with its own statis - tics based on its own definitions and, often, its own biases.ISAAA's signature data set is a tally of the global land area planted with biotech crops, which has been growing steadily since the organiza - tion began tracking it in 1996. Ac - cording to ISAAA's graph, a record 395 million acres were planted with biotech crops in 2011 and, most im - portant to James, developing coun - tries for the first time accounted for half of that. \"I call it the Clive curve,\" says Dafang Huang, former direc - tor of biotechnology at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing. Huang says he has used the graph, along with other data, to en - courage China's former and current prime ministers to embrace the tech - nology. \"We make policy to develop biotechnology based on that curve,\" Huang says. That's just how James hoped his data would make its mark. \"A farmer in a developing country sees that a farmer in Burkina Faso is us - ing biotechnology and thinks: 'Why can't I do that?'\" says James. \"We share with them what has already been achieved and let them decide what to do.\" It's not the most direct way to get GM crops into the hands of poor farmers. But as James sees it, knowledge is the foundation for the acceptance of the technology. With - out it, fear and misunderstanding stirred up by naysayers would guide policy, leaving no pathway for crop development. Power of Being a People Person James, an eloquent Welshman, first witnessed poverty in the 1970s while working for the Food and Agricul - ture Organization and the Canadian International Development Agency in countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya and Mali. \"You get immersed when you visit these countries and it creates an impression,\" James says. \"I became convinced that feeding the world is our most formidable challenge.\" He moved to Mexico in 1981 to work for the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) where he served as deputy director general for research. There he developed a close working relationship with Norman Borlaug, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate who is known as the \"father of the green rev - olution.\" Borlaug valued strongly the role of technology in achieving food security, and James admired him for that. \"It's not often that you have the chance to get to know a Nobel laure - ate and travel around the world with him, getting his wisdom,\" says James. James adopted much of Borlaug's way of thinking. \"Norman didn't fear people and some of that rubbed off on Clive,\" says Richard Flavell, chief scientific adviser at Ceres in Thousand Oaks, California, and for - mer secretary to ISAAA. \"Norman was willing to say to any government leader what he believed,\" Flavell says. \"Clive has that directness.\"\"I BECAME CONVINCED THAT FEEDING THE WORLD IS OUR MOST FORMIDABLE CHALLENGE.\" \u2014CLIVE JAMES F_Profiles.indd 72 4/2/13 1:04 PMWORLDVIEW PROFILES 73 James's first major foray into biotechnology was helping create a molecular genetics lab at CIMMYT in 1986. The lab established CIMMYT's capacity to collaborate in biotech's early years. It also gave James an op - portunity to build a network of inter - national contacts in crop biotechnol - ogy. \"Clive thought nothing of having breakfast in one country, lunch in another country and dinner in anoth - er,\" says Ronald Phillips, a genomics professor emeritus at the University of Minnesota who accompanied James on several networking trips to Europe. But James wanted to do more to bring biotech crops to developing countries. \"Clive, from his experience with CIMMYT, felt that developing countries were unlikely to get into the technology with the urgency that we all thought was important,\" says Fla - vell. In 1990 James retired from CIM - MYT to found ISAAA. The Biotech Broker James initially focused on brokering tech-transfer deals between private corporations, funding agencies and developing countries. In his first deal, in 1990, James convinced Monsanto to donate its virus-resistant potato technology to the Mexican govern - ment for use by small-scale farmers, and got the Rockefeller Foundation to fund the project. He was a natural. James went on to broker 10 public-private deals in ISAAA's first decade. \"There wasn't another organization doing that at the time, and that was its value,\" says Flavell. But by the late 1990s, public opinion of biotech had changed. \"It became harder to raise money from foundations and part of the reason it was hard was because of the unease stirred up by the Greenpeaces of the world,\" says Flavell. Also by then, oth - er agencies began serving as liaisons in agricultural biotech, and ISAAA's role ceased to be unique, he says. Undeterred, James began to see knowledge dissemination as the cru - cial piece to his mission. ISAAA's primary communication, its annual report, now reaches millions in 70 countries in more than 50 languag - es. The nearly 300-page document breaks down the distribution of crops by country, crop and trait, and James seems to have much of it memorized. Ask him a question about the regula - tory barriers blocking the adoption of biotech crops, and he'll invariably answer with a number that suggests that things are looking up. \"Fifty percent of growth in biotech crop production is in developing coun-tries,\" he might say. Like his mentor Borlaug, James's legacy, in part, may end up being his optimism. \u00a9 DEANNA STAFFO F_Profiles.indd 73 4/2/13 1:05 PM74 AUSTRALIA \\ COSTA RICA BEWARE OF BACTERIA BEARING DRUGS Australian-based EnGeneIC takes the Trojan Horse approach to /f_i ghting cancer Scientists engaged in the battle against can- cer have in recent years developed targeted therapies capable of attacking tumors without causing the side effects associated with traditional chemotherapy. The problem with this approach, however, is that the patient's surviving cancer cells can then mutate and develop resistance to the drugs being used.The founders of EnGeneIC, a small biotechnology company located on the outskirts of Sydney, Australia,believe they have found a solution. Jennifer MacDiarmid and Himanshu Brahmbhatt developed a delivery system that they say can be loaded with drugs for all types of solid tumors\u2014along with molecules capable of blocking key proteins responsible for multi-drug resistance. \"I think we have a platform that can nally make personalized cancer medicine a reality,\" says MacDiarmid. To produce their EnGeneIC Delivery Vehicles (EDVs), MacDiarmid and Himanshu encouraged bacteria to divide at their ends rather than at their middles, resulting in mini bacterial cells devoid of genetic material. In contrast to some other targeted therapies, the EDVs can be loaded with a wide range of drugs. At just 400 nanometers across, the EDVs slip through gaps in leaky blood-vessel walls, which tumors create to keep them supplied with oxygen and nutrients. To COUNTRY SPOTLIGHTSthe outside of the EDVs scientists add a molecular structure composed of two different antibodies. One end sticks to the EDV, and the other locks onto receptors on the surface of cancer cells. After the antibodies lock on, the cancerous cells swallow the bacterial ones, at which point they release their cancer- ghting payload. \"The drug doses are thousands of times lower than if you are just flooding the body, making it cheaper and\u2014more important for the patient\u2014preventing side effects,\" MacDiarmid says. Typically, tumors survive attacks from drugs through gene mutations that increase the production of multiple drug-resistant proteins and altered cell-death mecha-nisms. EnGeneIC showed that a short interfering RNA molecule (siRNA) that silences these genes can be packaged into their EDVs, thereby overcoming resistance. Back in 2007, animal research demonstrating the effectiveness of EDVs created a stir . More recently, the results of the rst human trial were presented at a 2012 American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Dublin, Ireland. The study showed EDVs loaded with the drug paclitaxel to be safe and well-tolerated in 28 patients with a variety of advanced, incurable can-cers. It remains to be seen if the technology improves outcomes. MacDiarmid and Himanshu set up the company in 2001 with private investment backing, and have received approximately $10 million of Australian government funding. Moreover, they recently got the go-ahead for a phase I/IIa trial, which will test the ef cacy of their EDVs against recurrent glioma. Still, MacDiarmid acknowledges that they are likely to need to team up with a larger pharmaceutical company to get EDVs to market. \u2014NIC FLEMING\"I think we have a platform that can nally make personalized cancer medicine a reality.\" \u2014Jennifer MacDiarmid Source: loaded into EDVTargted EDVLinker Antibody that binds to receptor on cancer cellAntibody that binds to PHARMAMAR Tales of pirate gold lure treasure hunters to its rainforests. Divers flock to its waters to see giant schools of hammerhead sharks. Now, a hunt for new anti-cancer drugs draws scientists to Costa Rica's Cocos Island, which lies 340 miles southwest of the country's Pacific coast. An expedition that started in February marks the beginning of a major research collaboration between Spanish pharmaceuti-cal company PharmaMar and Costa Rica's National Biodiversity Institute (INBio). Under a five-year deal, divers will collect samples of marine organisms, primarily invertebrates, such as sponges, sea squirts and mollusks. Extracts from these will be screened against panels of human tumor cells, with those exhibiting potential being studied further to identify active compounds. PharmaMar has built up a li- brary of extracts taken from 125,000 marine organism species through similar surveys in countries across the world, including Kenya, Tanza-nia, East Timor, Papua New Guinea, Vietnam and Madagascar . The company's drug Yondelis, based on an extract from a sea squirt, is an approved treatment for soft-tissue sarcoma and reoccurring ovarian cancer in Europe and elsewhere. It has four other marine compounds in the research pipeline. HEALING WATERS The Costa Rican government and Spain's PharmaMar go deep to find natural cures for cancer MARINE PLANTS AND ANIMALS COULD SPAWN ADVANCED DRUGS.As far as terrestrial species go, Costa Rica is known for its high levels of biodiversity, thanks to the mixing of species from North and South America. \"Its extensive marine biodiversity has not been as well studied,\" says Carmen Cuevas, director of research and develop-ment at PharmaMar . \"We think there is great potential there.\" Both the generation of new knowledge about the natural world as well as its sustainable use by humans were key principles behind the creation of INBio in 1989. It has since signed a series of collabora-tive bioprospecting agreements with private companies and academic institutions around the world. The PharmaMar partnership will help the country advance its ambition to become a leading biotechnology player, according to Gabriela Llobet, director gen-eral of the Costa Rican Investment Promotion Agency. \"Since 2010, we have been pushing the life sciences sector, which includes not only our existing cluster of medical-device companies but also a greater focus on biotechnology.\" At least one other expedition will take place this year following the first one to Cocos Island. The precise location of this and future missions are still to be discussed. PharmaMar will provide training sessions to help INBio researchers learn advanced techniques to iden-tify and develop potential sources of new drugs from natural sources. While PharmaMar scientists will focus on the discovery of anti-cancer compounds, INBio will also investigate the marine samples for other uses such as anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-inflammatory properties. The precise details of the agreement are confidential, however it is understood that INBio will earn a share in any benefits derived from profitable discoveries. \u2014NIC FLEMING CountrySpotlights.indd 75 4/2/13 11:23 AM76 EGYPT \\ MALW AI \\ RUSSIA While the nation ratified its constitution, scientists in Egypt held a new conference on industrial biotechnology Last December, as Egyptians prepared for the referendum on their new consti- tution, a group of scientists met in Cairo to focus on the future of the region's biotech industry. Attended by 65 scientists from 18 developing countries, the First Winter School on Industrial Biotechnology was organized by Egypt's Science and Technology Development Fund (STDF) and India's Centre for Science and Technology of the Non-Aligned and Other Developing Countries. The gathering was designed to benefit student research-ers in the field, providing lectures and hands-on training with an emphasis on bioprocessing, modeling systems and biotech-based enterprises. The event reflects the optimism of some Egyp-tian scientists about the future of biotech research and its applications in their country, despite the politi-cal unrest there. Mahmoud Sakr, STDF's executive director, points out that Egypt's newly ratified constitution (approved just weeks after the Winter School ended) requires the state to provide funding for universities and research centers. \"I think this is a very positive develop-ment,\" he says.One attendee, Oluse- gun Adetunji, chief sci-entific officer at Nigeria's National Biotechnology Development Agency, describes the facilities at Egypt's National Research Center, where the hands-on training sessions were held, as \"state-of-the-art.\" Adetunji says that many of the participants\u2014from countries includ-ing Egypt, South Africa, Sudan, Gambia, India, Nigeria and Zimbabwe\u2014 described tremendous competency in their countries in traditional industrial biotechnology involving food processing, the preparation of local medicines and enzyme production. However, he notes that the application of industrial biotechnol-ogy in some countries remains in its infancy, due to insufficient funding, an inadequate infrastructure and the poor commercial-ization of bioproducts. Nonetheless, Egypt is strong in industrial bio- technology as it relates to ag-riculture. One example is its production of Agerin, a Bacil-lus thuringiensisproduct that has insecticidal proper-ties. \"Egypt produces this commercially and exports it to many countries,\" TEA & SYNERGY In Malawi, researchers and tea farmers work together to produce drought-resistant crops Last year's severe drought in Malawi was grim for tea growers, who lost five per-cent of their crops due to a combination of parched conditions and rising temperatures. But the almost 300,000 people employed in the tea sector received some good news: many tea cultivars developed over the past 20 years and planted from around 2001 onward showed excellent drought-resistant traits. Furthermore, a large number of them exhibited higher-yielding traits, higher resistance to pests and diseases, and better quality. \"I would say that right now be- cause of drought-tolerant cultivars, as much as 20-25 percent of crops \"Most farmers in Egypt own only one or less faddans and thus prefer to resort to manual methods of biological control.\" \u2014Mahmoud SakrREDRAFTING SCIENCE & SOCIETYPICKERS IN MALAWI MAKE UP SOME OF THE ALMOST 300,000 PEOPLE EMPLOYED IN THE TEA INDUSTRY . CountrySpotlights.indd 76 4/2/13 11:38 says Albert Chan- gaya, director of the Tea Research Foundation of Central Africa, of which Malawi is a member . \"The cultivars showed different reactions due to the lack of rains. Most stopped growing but were still green, and one cultivar, called PC 168, dropped leaves due to drought,\" says Changaya, the excitement palpable in his voice. This is also good news for Malawi's foreign exchequer . Before the droughts started recurring frequently, as much as 15 percent of Malawi's foreign exchange came from tea exports. Now, those ex-ports generate $35 billion, just 8-10 percent of Malawi's total foreign ex-change. Last year Malawi produced 49 million kilograms of tea, down from highs of 60 million kilos when droughts were less frequent. Malawi experienced droughts in 1987, 1992 and 2005, but since then the frequency of severe dry periods has been increasing\u2014with another soon after in 2008, and another in 2012. The culprit is climate change, which not only causes droughts, but also rising temperatures. The most destructive pest for tea bushes is a bug called Helopeltis, which thrives in higher temperatures, multiply-ing very quickly. \"What [Helopeltis] does, is it sucks the sap from tender leaves,\" says Changaya, \"and the effect is only visible four or five months later, by which time it is too late to do anything about it.\" However, replanting entire tea estates with drought-resistant, high-yielding or pest-resistant tea clones is expensive, costing as much as $5,000 an acre. In addition, replanting involves removing the old cultivars and replacing them with new ones that take five years to reach maturity\u2014leading to a loss of revenue, particularly for small-holder farmers working less than two hectares of land. \"We tell them the initial invest- ment is high, sure, but the better cultivars will stay for 100 years,\" says Changaya, adding that the foundation is advising farmers to replace a small portion of old cultivars with plant resistant ones and gradually build up. Increasingly, tea growers are recognizing the value of the invest-ment. \"This has improved lives, as even now the tea quality is already much better,\" says Changaya. \"The future for tea in Malawi is very bright.\" \u2014SHAILAJA NEELAKANTAN says Sakr . Although Egypt has the capacity to produce biofertilizers and biopesticides, investment in these products remains low. \"Biological control products are used on very large farms,\" Sakr ex-plains. \"Most farmers in Egypt own only one or less feddans [approximately 1 acre] and thus prefer to resort to manual methods of biological control.\" Still, there are other areas in which Egypt could enhance its indus-trial biotechnology. For example, Mahmoud Ibra-him, head of the biotech-nology division at Egypt's National Research Center, sees the country as having a very strong potential for producing proteins and enzymes from local sources, such as plants specific to the region, which could then be used locally as well as exported. Ultimately, the inspiration generated by events like the Winter School may yield the biggest changes in Egypt's biotech future. \"We learned how to apply our theoretical knowledge and what we do in the lab at a large scale, and how it can then enter industry,\" says attendee Doaa Ali, a research assistant in genetic engi-neering and biotechnol-ogy at Egypt's National Research Center . \"The infrastructure is there,\" she says. \"We just need the additional fund-ing necessary to take production to the next level.\" \u2014NADIA EL-AWADYA RUSSIAN FIRST Government and private dollars merge to bolster the life sciences Building a biotech industry in any country poses huge challenges, and Russia faces some of the worst. In general, Russia lacks the foundations required for successful biotechnology innova- tion. Consequently, this country clings near the bottom of the Scientific American Worldview Scorecard, as it has for several years. Still, some Russians remain optimistic\u2014hoping to buy their way into a better position in the field. As Alexey Eliseev, managing director of the Maxwell Biotech Venture Fund (MBVF), says, \"What we have to do, in many ways, is build a new industry in the country.\" That requires collaboration, which the Russian government is working hard to generate. In June of 2006, the Russian Venture Company was launched to provide a public stream of venture capital funds intended to jump-start the country's investment opportunities. One of these, Eliseev's MBVF, is the first Russian venture fund fully dedicated to the life sciences. Worth $100 million and created with roughly 50% government money and 50% private capital, the MBVF is managed by a Russian financial firm, Maxwell Asset Management, and partners with the Maxwell Biotech Group in making portfolio investments.\u00a9 JANE MORRIS\"We tell them the initial investment is high, sure, but the better culti-vars will stay for 100 years.\" \u2014Albert Changaya CountrySpotlights.indd 77 4/2/13 11:39 AM78 THE PHILIPPINES \\ THE NETHERLANDS The drug, called Myrcludex B, is a synthesized peptide chain similar in structure to a hepatitis B membrane protein. Hepatera developed the drug in close collabo-ration with the German biotech company MYR GmbH, in Burgwedel, which is also funded by a European venture fund, High-Tech Gr\u00fcnderfonds. The results of the study are expected by the end of 2013. One of Maxwell's portfolio companies has already launched a product. The Russian firm Photonics\u2014yet another resident of the Skolkovo Innovation Center\u2014in collaboration with Dental Photonics, in Walpole, Massachusetts, developed a compact surgical laser system designed for soft-tissue procedures in cardiol-ogy, obstetrics and gynecology, proctology and the ear, nose and throat specialty. Originally called stLase and now marketed under the brand name Alta, Photonics is selling the system in the United States, Japan and Russia, and is seeking approval in South Korea. The laser design has won two international awards: the iF Product Design Award in 2013 and Good Design in 2012. The MBVF doesn't restrict its funding to late-stage products, however, and has several investments in pre-clinical therapies. Among these is Skolkovo's OncoMax, founded in 2010, which is developing a monoclonal antibody that targets a novel pathway for possible use in treating kidney cancer . Another is Osteros Biomed-ica, launched last year, which is currently preparing a proof-of-concept clinical trial program for its first drug candidate, MBC-11. Initially discovered by MBC Pharma in Aurora, Colorado, this drug shows promise in treating multiple myeloma, osteosarcoma and other metastatic bone lesions. Eliseev hopes that tangible products will emerge from many of the portfolio companies within the fund's ten-year life, which will end in 2019. But those involved in Maxwell don't want the initiative ending there. \"We are looking at the possibility of raising a new fund after that,\" Eliseev says. \"We're already talking to a variety of potential partners.\" \u2014MELISSA LEE PHILLIPS\"What we have to do, in many ways, is build a new industry in the country.\" \u2014Alexey Eliseev When the fund started four years ago, its partners analyzed the biotechnology investment opportunities in Russia, but decided that the field was still a bit too young to justify intense investment, says Eliseev. He and his colleagues realized that they needed to start from scratch. \"The way our fund has decided to do that,\" he says, \"is by collaborating with Western companies, particularly in the U.S., investing in those companies and licensing and co-developing products from that.\" To facilitate this collaboration, the fund maintains of-fices in both Moscow and Boston\u2014where two of their portfolio companies are located. The partnerships with Western companies make Maxwell a \"fairly unique investment model,\" Eliseev says. The Maxwell fund currently invests in nine com- panies: five are in the U.S., two are based on western European projects that began in Russia, and two are solely Russian. The scientific fields involved vary widely, including oncology, neurology, cardiology, infectious disease, asthma and medical devices. Maxwell personnel use several criteria to decide if a company or product is suitable for their investment, Eliseev says. The most important thing is having a promising product. \"In that sense, our criteria are not much different from other ven-ture capitalists,\" he says. But, because one of their major goals is promoting the development of Russia's biotechnology industry, they also consider whether the product in devel-opment is likely to be important in the Russian market. \"For most of the projects we invest in, we conduct part of the development in Russia\u2014in particular, the clinical trials,\" Eliseev says. \"Therapeutic projects are usually those that have good patient recruitment for trials in Russia and a properly developed infrastruc-ture,\" he says. \"We've invested in several therapeutic companies, and we're quite happy with their progress.\" In December 2012, the Russian company Infectex\u2014 located in the Skolkovo Innovation Center, a planned high-technology business area near Moscow\u2014announced enrollment in phase IIb-III clinical trials for a drug called SQ109, designed to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. SQ109 was originally developed by the U.S. biotech Sequella, in Rockville, Maryland. The trial is expected to last for two years, and will be the pivotal study determining Russian regulatory approval.

Some countries offer so-called feed-in tariffs (FITs) that force energy suppli-ers to pay customers\u2014often businesses them-selves\u2014who add power to the grid with their own renewable sources, which can range from biomass to solar . For example, the Philippine Energy Regula-tion Commission's July 2012 approval of FITs for renewable energy sources is expected to attract as much as $1.3 billion in investments in the sector, with biomass sources be-ing particularly attractive in this agricultural coun-try. The FIT for biomass was set at 6.63 Philippine pesos per kilowatt hour, and the installation target for biomass sources is set at a capacity of 250 mega-watts (MW). However, the poten- tial for biomass energy is much higher in the Philip-pines, and these FITs are expected to serve as a kickstart for the first three years of development in the sector . With its massive agricultural production, the Philippines generates huge volumes of waste with immense potential for biomass energy. Its major crops\u2014rice, corn, sugar and coconut\u2014all carry large quantities of agricultural trash that can be tapped for energy. Edna Tatel, a spokes- person for the Biomass Alliance of the Philip-pines, says the group has developed and proposed 39 projects to the country's National Renewable Energy Board that would provide a total installed capacity of 434 MW. \"These are a mix of combustion types, [including] methane capture from municipal and animal wastes and gasification technolo-gies,\" she explains. \"The potential is way above 434 MW, though, as this figure includes only 40 MW from sugar mills\u2014when in fact, the sugar sector holds a huge potential for bio-mass energy as a whole.\" Tatel says the alliance consists of 13 members. Francis Saturnino Juan, executive director of the country's Energy Regulatory Commission, agrees that the potential is larger than the installation target. Even so, the reason for the lower target is to limit the impact of FIT on the consumers, since all electricity consumers will pay for the FIT. The Philip-pines already has among the highest electricity rates in Asia. The biomass facili- ties currently generating power are mostly sugar mills. At present, the sugar companies use the power they generate themselves, and 200 MW per year is their current installed capacity. \"If we are to compare generation of electric-ity for every pound of sugarcane processed, we generate only 25-30 percent of what other sugar mills in Brazil and Guatemala are generat-ing,\" says a spokesperson of the Philippine Sugar Millers Association, who didn't wish to be named. According to Tatel, there are 29 operating sugar mills in the country, and if all these adapt to more efficient technologies, she says, the Philippine sugar industry will be able to make huge contributions to the grid. \u2014SHAILAJA with two treatments Since Jesse Gelsinger died from gene therapy in 1999, a viable future for those with the most to gain from such technology\u2014patients and inves-tors\u2014has been in doubt. Research-ers have struggled to find a delivery platform that overcomes concerns of causing cancer or compromising the immune system. Overall, gene therapy's real promise, a disease cure, has remained elusive because of overriding safety concerns. Nonetheless, in November 2012, the European Commission (EC) approved Glybera. uniQure, based in Amsterdam, the Nether-lands, built this gene therapy on an adeno-associated virus platform that is delivered via an insect-based system. Also known as alipogene tiparvovec, Glybera cures a rare disorder called lipoprotein lipase deficiency, and is delivered into the patients' legs via intramuscular injections. Affected patients have a faulty gene that fails to make lipoprotein lipase, which clears the SWEET SOURCE OF POWER Biomass-based energy promises to charge up the electricity market in the Philippines CountrySpotlights.indd 79 4/2/13 11:50 AM80 UNITED ARAB EMIRATES \\ UNITED STATES \\ DENMARK CALLING FOR COLLABORATORS A conference in Dubai looks for new ways to bring cutting-edge medicine to the United Arab Emirates As the midday sun sparkled off the Jumeirah Emirates Towers in Dubai on November 28, 2012, leaders from the United Arab Emirates government, representatives of multinational pharmaceutical companies and healthcare experts from around the world gathered to discuss the future of healthcare in the UAE. The two-day competitiveness fo-rum, \"Health Care and Access to Innovative Medicines in the UAE,\" began with a clear message from Nidal Fakhoury, chairman of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association Gulf (PhRMAG)\u2014the UAE is seeking to collaborate with key stakeholders in the healthcare industry. That message was echoed by Amin Al Amiri, assistant undersecretary for medical practices and licensing at the UAE's ministry of health. In his keynote address, Al Amiri stressed that healthcare is one of the most important issues to the UAE, and that the country is dedicated to bringing the most innovative medicines to its people. Some healthcare companies might ask, \"Why should I come to Dubai?\" In his talk at the forum, David Harris, director of international logistics services in the Dubai office of foreign direct investment, gave an answer: \"Geography.\" Harris pointed out the accessibility provided by 150 shipping lines at UAE ports and a wide range of airline flights. \"The infrastructure is there,\" he said. Harris and his colleagues are working to ensure that the research capital exists, as well. Along those lines, he noted ongoing work taking place to develop a network of venture capital sources supporting home-grown research in the UAE. During the second day of the forum, participants learned about the diversity of metrics used to assess a country's innovation potential in the Scientific American Worldview Scorecard. In addition, Sari Al-Abdulrazzak, manager of Deloitte & Touche Strategy Consulting in the UAE, highlighted how running clinical trials in the Emirates costs only about 50 percent of what it does in the U.S. or Europe. blood of fats. Glybera didn't come by its approval easily. Private inves-tors rescued uniQure's founding company, Amsterdam Molecular Therapeutics, during the treat-ment's drawn-out, two-year-long approval process. \"If Glybera had not been ap- proved, gene therapy might never have recovered, because companies like [uniQure] would no longer be able to find investors prepared to take the risk,\" says Norman Miller, director of Oxford PharmAssist, a London-based medical consulting company. Soon after Glybera's final ap- proval, uniQure started a phase 1 gene-therapy trial for acute inter-mittent porphyria, another rare, possibly life-threatening disease that can cause liver cancer and kidney failure. Sander van Deventer\u2014general partner at Forbion, an investment group in Naarden, the Netherlands\u2014says that while the phase 1 trial wasn't dependent on Glybera's approval, \"the approval of Glybera paves the way for other products. We are entering a new era of therapeutic possibilities.\" uniQure's CEO J\u00f6rn Aldag understands the EC's concerns, but says that the regulatory process needs more flexibility. Miller agrees. Once the product is proved safe, says Aldag, extensive, long-term clinical trials become super-fluous. \"You can't force people to get back to the old paradigm, the six-year development cycle,\" he says. \"It doesn't make economic sense.\" When the signs of clini-cal benefit appear, approve it, he says, and scrutinize the data later . A post-approval commitment to the European Medicines Agency involves doing just that. Miller said performing large patient trials involving gene therapy isn't possible because the subjects aren't available, and in some cases, neither is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. That was the case with Glybera. \"Its administration requires many intramuscular injections in a single session under spinal anesthesia, which for ethical reasons could not be given to controls,\" he explains. The U.S. Food and Drug Admin- istration also has concerns. For example, Brian Malkin, a partner at the Washington, D.C., law firm Frommer Lawrence & Haug, says the FDA wants drug sponsors to do more homework before applying for clinical-trial approval. \"They want more upfront work,\" he says. That requirement will be an added pressure on any company looking to enter this arena. \u2014CHRISTINE BAHLS CountrySpotlights.indd 80 4/2/13 12:03 PMCOUNTRY SPOTLIGHTS 81 TEAMING UP ON TYPE 1 DIABETES Denmark-based Novo Nordisk and the New York City-based JDRF combine forces Success in science often depends on teamwork. In the spring of 2012, a great example of this principle emerged in a partnership between the Denmark-based phar-maceutical giant Novo Nordisk and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foun-dation (JDRF), a nonprofit organization in New York City dedicated to funding research on type 1 dia-betes. For its part, JDRF will steer hand-picked projects to Novo Nordisk to review, and possibly de-velop further . One caveat: the specified projects must focus primarily on immune system-based therapies and vaccines. Matthias von Her- rath, a Novo Nordisk vice president who directs the company's type 1 diabetes R&D center in Seattle, characterizes the JDRF as having the \"best view\" of the type 1 research land-scape worldwide. But why focus pri- marily on immune system-based therapies? Because type 1 diabetes is an immune disease, von Herrath says, and has been proven so time and time again. In addition, says Peter Kurtzhals, Novo Nordisk's senior vice president in charge of its diabetes research division, \"We believe that autoantigen-specific therapies have a better chance [to produce] a better safety profile.\" He declines to say how much Novo Nordisk had set aside to spend on these new discoveries, but says his company is willing to \"go all the way.\" Its overall research budget for type 1 and 2 diabetes is $1.5 billion. Richard Insel, JDRF's chief scientific officer, says his organization joined the partnership because Novo Nordisk is interested in translational research. Without that, he says, a cure isn't possible. No money is chang- ing hands in this deal. \"This is not about funding Novo Nordisk,\" Insel says. \"This is an opportunity to take what [JDRF has] funded and translate it, use the know-how and the commercial orientation and mindset of a major pharmaceutical company and translate early stage discoveries and move our projects forward.\" Without pharma's input, he says, \"We will never succeed.\" Another reason why JDRF liked the col-laboration\u2014which in the beginning will go for two years, but will probably be extended further\u2014is that von Herrath is well-known to the group, having received the JDRF's Scholar Award in 2007. Insel wouldn't specify how many discoveries the JDRF has sent to von Herrath's group since the collaboration became official, other than to say \"multiple.\" What excites von Herrath is the project's innovative structure\u2014the opportunity for silos to cross, as he puts it\u2014to break down barriers. What he wants is for the right people to work together and in the right process. He is also excited about a new database that JDRF will help establish, one that will only publish failed findings. That's huge, von Herrath says. \"What we have seen in the last decade is a lot of disappointment,\" says Kurtzhals, referring to unsuccessful trials and therapies with safety con-cerns. \"It was time for us to act.\" \u2014CHRISTINE BAHLSNonetheless, innovation in medicine depends on more than just inexpensive clinical trials. As Peter Pitts, president and cofounder of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest and former associate commissioner for external relations at the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-istration, told the forum's participants, innovation is slow, hard, expensive, under attack and important. Moving forward with innovative healthcare prod- ucts and services in the UAE will likely depend on collaborations among many Gulf states. For example, in discussing the Gulf Cooperation Council\u2014a political and economical alliance between several nations\u2014Al Amiri said, \"We walk together as one for the sake of our communities.\" That kind of teamwork often pays large returns in today's healthcare environment, but success depends on building resources, from basic research and development through marketing. \u2014MIKE MAY \"What we have seen in the last decade is a lot of disappointment... It was time for us to act.\" \u2014Peter Kurtzhals CountrySpotlights.indd 81 4/2/13 12:07 PMGoogle \"big data\" and you might notice a few things. You'll get a live demo of the speed and power of Google's data-sifting algorithms. You'll see data-dishing giants like IBM and SAS jockeying to position their definitions of the term. For example, SAS breaks it down alliteratively as volume, variety and velocity. And you'll notice that the phrase is firmly planted in the lexicographical firmament, now surpassing in hits even the venerable \"big daddy.\" But what's the difference between \"big data\" and simply having lots of in - formation? \"The term arose when data became of a size that it couldn't fit into memory and couldn't be processed with the normal tools,\" says Colin Hill, CEO and cofounder of GNS Healthcare, in Cambridge, Massachusetts. GNS uses big data to tackle big problems. For instance, GNS is working with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Mount Sinai School of Medicine to unravel the biology behind multiple myeloma, a blood cancer. Big data has evolved with technology to encompass \"the speed [and] com - plexity of data [and] ultimately what you can do with the data,\" says Hill, who can frequently be found on the conference circuit leading sessions with such titles as \"Man + Machines: Big Strides in Big Data.\"Biotechnology plants its analytic head deep into the cloud, deploying algorithms to derive meaning from a flood of information MAKING THE MOST OF MATHHill and colleagues apply cloud-based supercomputers, artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques\u2014akin to the way a system teaches itself to distinguish spam from legit e-mail\u2014to multiple streams of incongruous data \"and start turning that data into knowledge.\" He says that these tech - niques have surpassed standard sta - tistical analysis, finding patterns and correlations, to adopt \"more sophisti - cated methods that can turn the data into models of complex systems.\" GNS's ascent follows the data ex - plosion of the genomics revolution, which has equipped scientists with the information \"to get to the under - lying molecular basis of human life 'Big' in 'Big Data 'The BY BILL CANNON ILLUSTRATIONS BY GREG BETZA G_Math.indd 82 4/2/13 12:15 PMand disease, disease-progression and drug Hill says. \"We cre - ated our company [12 years ago] to be the first to turn the 'omic data\u2014and not just from DNA sequences but also from gene expression and disease out - comes\u2014into computer models\" and, ultimately, medicine tailored to an individual's genetic makeup. \"Math is at the core of what we do,\" says Hill, himself trained as a physicist. \"The mathematics and those algorithms get implemented on the computers and get applied to biologi - cal and medical data.\" In fact, mathe - matics, physics and computer science make up \"the secret sauce,\" Hill says. \"It's not what you've heard a lot about in the world of medicine and biol - ogy and healthcare, but it's absolutely critical. Obamacare will not become a success and we will not get at our healthcare costs and quality conun - drum without the development and application and validation of the very best mathematical machine learning that companies like GNS Healthcare are pioneering.\" At the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Labora - tory in Richland, Washington, math - ematical biologists like William R. Cannon (no relation to the author)are butting against the limits of big data as they grapple with 'omics of their own to analyze small molecules in biofuels. \"We can generate lots of big data,\" Cannon says\u2014hundreds of terabytes. \"It's easy to do that now. But having the big data is both good and bad. The ability to generate all the data cheaply has really changed the way we do biology. But it's bad in that sometimes we get enamored with the data itself and forget that it's not just big data that's important but mean - ingful data\u2014data that we can accept or reject hypotheses with and make a significant step forward in our knowl - edge about the science.\" Whereas Google and others work in \"what we call model-free analysis,\" Cannon says, \"in science, the chal - lenge is actually different. We do what is called a model-based inference\" because \"we've got so much previous knowledge that needs to be captured. And before we generate data, we need to use those models to help us design experiments so that we can get the maximum information out of an ex - periment that generates big data.\" EVOLVING INTO EQUATIONS Machine-learning algorithms do have a place in basic science\u2014to a degree, Cannon says. Through machine learn - ing, biologists can find \"associations between different proteins or differ - ent genes. But the meaning of that association is often lost because of the nature of the data analysis.\" Suppose someone wants to fig - ure out how best to coax a microbe to produce a specific small molecule such as butanol. That researcher must be able to predict how much butanol the cell will produce under different conditions. \"You can do the metabo - lomics, and you can now measure the concentration or the counts of that metabolite, but you don't know how to integrate that with your model,\" Cannon says. \"It's the same thing with proteomics. An ex - periment may tell us observed versus not-observed\" as op - posed to more mean - ingful information, such as whether a product is present in a cell or is genuinely absent instead of simply unobserved. \"Those two things have different meanings and a model helps sort it out.\" A model informs the data and vice versa. With a solid model in place, Cannon says, \"we know what those associations are telling us, and then we can refine our model based on the new data. We can really start to translate the data into informa - tion regarding regulatory control or protein-protein interactions or even start building pathways based on the metabolites that we see.\" If all of this sounds a little more math-intensive than, for example, pre - paring an assay, you're on the right track. Biologists must evolve with a big data-driven biology. \"There are a lot of traditional folks who are educated in one area\u2014say, microbiology or immu - nology\u2014but don't have the broad back - grounds,\" says Cannon, who came up through the ranks as a biophysicist. He says the conversion of biology to a fully quantitative science \"is going to take a while. Serious efforts started probably back in the early 1990s, and it's 20 years later, and we still have a long way to go.\" \"Sometimes we get enamored with the data itself and forget that it's not just big data that's important but meaningful data\u2014data that we can accept or reject hypotheses with and make a significant step forward in our knowledge about the science.\" \u2014William R.

CHOI As the technology luminary Steve Jobs neared the end of his life, he told his bi-ographer, Walter Isaacson, \"I think the biggest innovations of the 21st century will be at the intersection of biology and technology. A new era is beginning.\" Among the companies seeking to bring this new era to life is Insilico Biotechnology, a privately held /f_i rm in Stuttgart, Germany. Insilico uses Europe's most powerful civil su-percomputer to help model and simulate living cells and solve problems for industry. Recent advances in computing power and high- throughput technologies that allow researchers to analyze biomolecules and cells en masse have triggered an explo-sion of data in the life sciences. For instance, the world's largest genome data centers now have the ability to store petabytes of data, with a petabyte representing nearly three times the amount of data stored in the U.S. Library of Congress's archive of websites. /T_h e /f_i eld of bioinformatics helps scientists extract knowledge from all of this information throughout the so-called 'omics levels\u2014from molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins and the metabolites generated by meta-bolic processes to cells, tissues, organs and, potentially, whole organisms. \"One of the holy grails of bioinformat-ics is computer models that can both describe and predict what is going on in cells,\" says Trey Ideker, chief of genet-ics at the University of California at San Diego's School of Medicine. SOUPED-UP CELLS Founded in 2001, Insilico creates computer models of living cells for such clients as BASF, the world's leading chemical company, and pharmaceutical giants Bayer and Seemingly S C I - F I Simulations Insilico Biotechnology uses computer-modeled cells to help answer the 'What ifs' of drug development G_Math.indd 84 4/2/13 8:05 AM MAKING MORE FROM MATH 85\u00a9 GREG BETZABoehringer Ingelheim. /T_h ese digital cells each can replicate the behavior of over 1,000 genes and up to 2,000 interconnected biochemical reactions simultaneously, such as those govern-ing metabolism and regulating genes. \"It can take ten years and cost hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a drug,\" says Bettina Stahnke, business development manager at Insili-co. \"Helping make drugs available earlier and at reduced cost doesn't only provide bene/f_i ts for companies, but for their patients as well. /T_h e potential of our technology is to save up to 50 percent of development costs.\" Currently, Insilico has models of about ten human cell types and more than 60 organisms, including humans, mice, yeast and such microbes as Streptomyces coelicol-or, which biotechnology /f_i rms o/f_t en use to manufacture drugs. /T_h ese models are tailored to match their customers' speci/f_i c cells, which involves asking for a host of data on how those cells behave\u2014for instance, how they grow dur-ing fermentation and what molecules they produce\u2014and verifying that these models mirror the actual cells. Using these models, Insilico can predict the e ects of changes their customers might want to carry out with their own cells. \"If a biotechnology company wants to en-hance the yield of a product,\" Stahnke explains, \"we can model what modi-fying the genes of the producing cells would accomplish, to see which genes they should target, which have a good chance for a favor-able yield, which reduce unwanted byproducts.\" For in-stance, when it comes to /f_i nding genes to target in the gut bacterium E. coli , Insilico can test 2-10 billion di erent gene combinations. \"We can also analyze other ways to optimize the pro- duction process, such as adjusting the composition of the media their cells grow in or the supplements they are fed,\" says Stahnke. \"/T_h at would be a very long and tedious pro-cess in the lab, but with high-performance computing, we can very quickly see what these changes will probably do in cells.\" One EU project bene/f_i ting from Insilico's tech-nology is PROMYSE (Products from Methanol by Syn-thetic Cell Factories), which aims to build cost-e ective, eco-friendly factories that use cells to manufacture com-pounds from methanol, in place of the relatively expensive sugars currently used as substrates. /T_h ese cells can also help pharmaceutical /f_i rms test po- tential drugs. \"Despite a great deal of preclinical and clini-cal testing, sometimes it's not until the late stages that a company /f_i nds out a drug doesn't work, and that a whole lot of money was spent for nothing,\" Stahnke says. \"We can model what e ects a potential drug at certain concen-trations will probably have, to see which might be the best candidate to proceed with. We can also model di erences between patients, such as di erent levels of enzymes they may possess, to see how patients of di erent backgrounds might respond to a drug.\" To run their models, Insilico has access to Hermit, Europe's fastest civil supercomputer. Hermit is currently capable of running at peta/f_l op speeds\u2014one quadrillion computing operations per second. \"Having access to one of Europe's fastest supercomputers, Insilico is able to run the simulation of many di erent cellular scenarios at the same time, which saves our customers valuable time,\" says Insilico CEO Klaus Mauch. A FANTASTIC FUTURE Insilico can also interconnect digital cells to form mod-els of organs. /T_h e company is part of Germany's Virtual Liver initiative, helping to model how the liver degrades, converts and synthesizes a variety of substances\u2014research that could lead to more e ective treatments for liver dis-ease. Insilico has also partnered with several EU research projects to de-velop computer models of cells and tissues that can help test cos-metics without using animals. In the future, Insilico hopes that bioinformatic models can advance personalized medicine and provide therapies tailored to each patient for maximum bene/f_i t and mini-mal unwanted side e ects. \"We could build simulations of di erent patients and see what might happen a/f_t er a drug is administered, to achieve a better /f_i t between drug and patient,\" Stahnke explains. Although bioinformatics companies like Insilico have already succeeded in building digital cell models, the /f_i eld remains far from mature. \"We can make models that can approximate what is going on in cells, but we need to know more biology before we can produce simulations that are truly predictive,\" says Leslie Loew, director of the Univer-sity of Connecticut Health Center's R. D. Berlin Center for Cell Analysis & Modeling. Still, \"No one doubts that in the long run, bioinfor- matics is going to be extraordinarily valuable for biotechs and pharma in guiding experiments and the development of new therapeutics,\" says Loew. \"I don't think truly predictive models have been realized yet, but there's no question it's going to happen.\" \"The potential of our technology is to save up to 50% of development costs.\" \u2014Bettina StahnkeDrugs can be mined from simulations and the sea (see page 75). G_Math.indd 85 4/2/13 12:14 PMLEARNING TO SHARE After decades of working in secrecy with a guarded silo mentality, the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers have reached a turning point. To thrive, indeed to survive, they've come to appreciate the need to cooperate and share information. And this could be the year that big pharma starts to collaborate in earnest. While it's true that drug - makers have always worked together in strategic alliances, what's different now is that sharing is happening on a large, some say unprec - edented, scale. Two powerful forces are shaping this trend: out-of-control drug development costs and public demands for transparency.In 2012, drugmakers representing more than half the worldwide pharma - ceutical industry joined forces to create TransCelerate BioPharma, a non-profit organization designed to cooperate in standardizing clinical trials, the most costly aspect of bringing a new medicine to market. Ten companies\u2014Abbott Laboratories, AstraZeneca, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Roche and Sanofi\u2014comprise its founding mem - bers, with their heads of R&D serving on TransCelerate's board of directors. \"It's really driven by financial is - sues that are arising from clinical trials costing north of $500 million now,\" says Robert Califf, director of the Duke Translational Medicine In - stitute at Duke University and cochair of the Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI), an effort by the US Food and Drug Administration to re - form the clinical trial process. \"It's got to come down.\" Califf sees CTTI in an advising role, developing and recommending best practices for clinical trials. Because of its industry heft, Califf says, \"Trans - Celerate is a major potential force to actually implement best practices and best policies.\" Healthcare companies combine strategies and data in an effort to make product development less costly and more efficient 86 BY KARYN HEDE G_Math.indd 86 4/2/13 8:11 AM MAKING MORE FROM MATH 87\u00a9 GREG BETZA GENTLE STEPS FOR GIANTS Initially, TransCelerate members have committed several million dollars to push development of shared resources, including a system for sharing drugs for use in comparative clinical trials and a common portal to standard-ize data entry from clinical-trial sites worldwide. \"/T_h ere are lots of things we do where there isn't competitive advantage,\" says Garry Neil, a for-mer executive at Johnson & Johnson who served as TransCelerate's interim CEO a/f_t er its founding. /T_h e goal is to achieve economies of scale in test-ing new drugs' safety and e cacy by combining forces to reduce ine cien-cy and avoid duplication of e ort. TransCelerate executives know that they are setting modest goals at the outset of this data-sharing experi-ment. \"We've started with projects which to us are imminently doable, and will then launch into larger and greater initiatives in a smart, stepwise fashion, as opposed to trying to boil the ocean at the outset,\" says Trans-Celerate's current CEO, Dalvir Gill. But TransCelerate is hardly the /f_i rst or only industry e ort to reform drug development and testing. In ad-dition to CTTI, two public-private reform groups\u2014the Critical Path In-stitute (C-PATH) and Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC)\u2014have formed the Coalition for Accelerating Standards and /T_h er-apies to create common standards and tools for studying major disease categories, such as pain and cardio-vascular disease.MERGING MENTAL METHODSHowever, real cooperation goes be-yond sharing tools and creating com-mon ground rules for conducting clinical research. For example, there has been a sense for some time among mental health researchers that in order to make meaningful progress, a dramatic shi/f_t toward pooling resourc-es and data is necessary. As a /f_i rst step toward encouraging companies to work together, Janssen Research & Development, an arm of Johnson & Johnson, created the Healthy Minds Initiative, a data-sharing project head-ed by Husseini Manji, who leads J&J's for neuroscience. /T_h e staggering complexity of men- tal health disease and the huge unmet need of its patients, says Manji, almost demands cooperation among compa-nies working in the /f_i eld. \"/T_h ere's a much greater chance you are going to be successful if you're working with other like-minded people who are putting in their resources, and that includes brain power and money, informatics capability, et cetera,\" he says. \"Sometimes that's hard.\" True as that may be, the success of some pioneering data-sharing proj-ects is helping to convince the indus-try of the bene/f_i ts of pooling data. In Europe, the Innovative Medi- cines Initiative, a $2.6 billion indus-try-sponsored initiative established in 2008, is starting to pay dividends. For example, several companies with active programs in schizophrenia re-search\u2014AstraZeneca, Janssen, Lilly, Lundbeck and P/f_i zer\u2014agreed to pool clinical-trial data from 64 industry-sponsored studies, along with two government-sponsored studies, in a common database. /T_h e pooled data yielded critical information for fu-ture research in the /f_i eld, according to Jonathan Rabinowitz of Bar-Ilan University in Israel, who presented an analysis of the data at a U.S. Institute of Medicine data-sharing meeting in November 2012. Among the /f_i ndings: four-week trials yielded as much use-ful information as six-week trials. EXPOSING THE SECRETS Data sharing has been more of a push-pull proposition in Europe, where public advocacy groups have been demanding access to raw data from clinical trials for several years. Facing public pressure, in late 2010 the Euro-pean Medicines Agency (EMA) began releasing\u2014upon written request\u2014regulatory documents for medicines that the agency had ruled on, regard-less of whether the drug was approved or rejected. /T_h e rule, which received little fanfare, has been used mainly by the drug compa-nies themselves to access each other's data, according to a review of requests published online by the Archives of In- ternal Medicine in December 2012. Beginning in 2014, the EMA will start making clinical-trial data pub-licly available. A dra/f_t of its policy is expected by June of this year for pub-lic comment and the /f_i nal policy will be published in late November. \"We know that industry is not very happy with what we are do-ing; that's not a secret,\" says Hans-Georg Eichler, senior medical o cer at EMA. \"But we always point out: 'Look, you will be the /f_i rst to learn from this exercise.' /T_h e number one user of our new openness is industry. /T_h ey want to see their competitors' data, and I trust that they hopefully will do something useful with it.\" Pharma's foundation is shifting toward sharing (see page 12). \"There's a much greater chance you are going to be successful if you're working with other like-minded people who are putting in ABEL Acentury and a half after Walt Whit - man observed, \"All truths wait in all things,\" hidden wonders are revealing themselves in the cells of bacteria and pandas, coded in grains of rice and the blood of unborn children. The delivery of genomic data has become an urgent need of clinical medicine, zoology, agriculture and dozens of other disciplines, all of them based on next-generation sequencing (NGS). The leader of this burgeon - ing field has arisen in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone in China, a nucleus of innovation, investment and genius barely a generation removed from the poor-man's paddies and political stranglehold of Maoist orthodoxy. At Shenzhen's BGI\u2014formerly the Beijing Genomics Institute\u2014squadrons of young scientists and technicians, some of them still of high-school age, are using the world's largest cadre of NGS capability to investigate everything from silkworms and the SARS virus to fruit bats and cucumbers. In 2010, the purchase of 128 sequencers from Illumina, of San Diego, California, gave BGI twice the sequencing capacity of any other institution. This purchase also supplied China with a commanding lead in genomic-data extraction. Such an extraordinary concentration of comput - ing power generates an avalanche of information needing to be stored, retrieved, transmitted and shared. Indeed, the challenges facing BGI's bioinformatics team stretch far beyond tera- and peta- to exabytes of information that, in Whitman's words, \"branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific.\" CHEAP DATA, SKYROCKETING ANALYSIS \"This is an unprecedented challenge for the world,\" says Shanghai-based George Baeder, senior vice president, Asia Pacific consulting and China commercial, Quintiles Transnational. \"The guys that founded BGI are on a mis - sion to create a whole new area of scientific inquiry. Their philosophy is, 'If it moves, sequence it.'\" Baeder is coauthor of the Monitor Group report \"China: The Life Sciences Leader of 2020.\" \"The way that drug discovery has operated for the past 100 years is to work through about 350 biological path - ways,\" Baeder explains. \"But the human-genome exercise over the past 30 years has given us a growing mass of data. Now, we can look at 35,000 pathways. The old model that we used has been blown out the window.\" Many experts echo his sentiments. \"When BGI ac - quired 50% of the sequencing capacity in the world, it was like a 'shock and awe' move,\" says Chicago-based Xing Xu, director of BGI's cloud computing product division. \"It made the world pay attention.\" Before this, Xu continues, \"you would basically search blindly around the genome, or you might have some very interesting phenotype, and you have to narrow down the target region. But with this amount of NGS technology, you can basically search everything. The bioinformatics challenge is to make this huge size of data accessible to the users.\" That's no small challenge. \"One of the jokes that people make is that 'we'll soon be down to the $1,000 genome and the $100,000 genome analysis,\" says Lincoln Stein, direc - tor of informatics and biocomputing at the Ontario Insti - tute for Cancer Research in Toronto, Canada. \"The wet lab is ahead of the dry lab. The challenge that everyone in the sequencing community is facing is how much data to keep. Often, it's more expensive to store the data than to re-run the experiment.\" Even now, one sequencing machine can produce more data than one research group can handle. CLOUDS BRING SUNSHINE The size of the data fuels the need for new analytical ap - proaches. \"We're trying to find a solution in the cloud,\" says Xu. \"We maintain the infrastructure, and the user can upload to the cloud, so they only pay for the time they need to do their calculations, and they don't need to buy the hardware.\" This liberates researchers from the daily, tedious maintenance work of doing analysis, so they can focus on solving biological problems, he says. Last June, Xu oversaw the first test of what he calls \"the data tsu - nami\"\u2014the transmission of 24 gigabytes of genomic data from Shenzhen to the University of California, Davis, in less than 30 seconds. Billions and Billions of Bytes With its unprecedented sequencing power, China's BGI unravels the genes of everything that moves \"The guys that founded BGI are on a mission to create a whole new area of scientific inquiry. Their philosophy is, 'If it moves, sequence already know that the amount of data will increase as sequencers become smaller and smaller and cheaper and cheaper,\" Xu says. So researchers need to move to cen-tralized resources, doing analysis in the cloud. \"To do it across the Internet is really, really painful because, with current technology, to transfer ten gigabytes of data would take a day or two. If we sequence a hundred times, it would take you a month!\" In transmitting data from Shenzhen to Davis, BGI relied on a bandwidth that is a thousand times what you get from the cable company. \"But how do you e ciently use this bandwidth?\" Xu asks. \"/T_h at's a really, really challenging problem.\" In looking at BGI's advances, Stein says, \"A lot of us feel in awe of what they've done. And they've done it so quick-ly. It's sort of like confronting a force of nature.\" He adds, \"But we don't feel that we're not competitive with them, because science involves asking the right questions. Hav-ing a lot of sequencing capacity doesn't necessarily mean that you can do that.\"/T_h e question is: How will BGI use this sequencing power? \"I think BGI's sponsors within the Chinese govern-ment see this as a platform for China's long-term competitiveness in science, technology and in-novation, but not as a means of dominance,\" says Baeder. \"Dominance in science is an outdated notion. /T_h e future of science is not a nationally owned thing.\" Nonetheless, BGI's bioinformatic prowess promises broad implications. \"/T_h e impact on every /f_i eld of science will be huge,\" says Xu. \"Maybe, in ten years, everyone who is born will be sequenced, and we can prevent disease. Like when a mechanic /f_i xes a car, they need a blueprint. Right now, your doctor prescribes drugs but he doesn't have your blueprint. But if we have seven billion people on earth, the amount of data will be huge. So we need a platform to han-dle this data, a new technology.\" What is important, he says, is the real-life application of the technology. \"/T_h is is the core behind BGI: how we use technology to change the world.\" Technologies beyond sequencing change today's biotechnology (see page 26). MAKING MORE FROM MATH 89 G_Math.indd 89 4/2/13 8:17 AM90 BY PETER GWYNNE he complexity and variation of the cancer genome means that patients with tumors of the same organ who receive identical treat-ments can experience markedly di erent results. To provide the most appropriate course of therapy, researchers need more precise methods for di erentiating between patients with high- and low-risk cancers of the same organ. A team of scientists at Norway's University of Oslo may have the solution. Based on a combination of statistics and genomics, their technique appears to stratify breast-cancer patients into groups with low and high risks of recurrence and death. If follow-up studies con/f_i rm the value of the approach, it could give physicians a reliable tool for avoiding unnecessarily aggressive or overly cautious treatment of individual cancer patients. \"Current methods cannot predict who will do well and who will not,\" says team member Hege Russnes, a patholo-gist at Oslo University Hospital. \"We wanted to identify the seriously ill patients so that they can receive aggressive treatment.\" Hans Kristian Vollan, Russnes's colleague at Oslo University Hospital, adds, \"With our new method, we can distinguish between patients with a good and a poor prognosis. /T_h is makes it easier to select the best treat-ment for the patient.\" /T_h e team focused on 600 Norwegians with breast can- cer, monitoring them over a ten-year period. /T_h e scientists discovered a statistical connection between alterations in a NOT JUST A NUMBER Norwegian scientists use statistical DNA analysis to predict disease outcomes, and perhaps save lives.Can smart bombs kill some cancers (see page 74)?

EVOLVING EXAMINATIONS Without an accurate means of assessing the risk of any par - ticular breast cancer, medical professionals will generally take an aggressive approach to treating all their patients, fearing the dangers of under-treating individuals incor - rectly labeled as low-risk. However, that approach offers potentially significant problems for patients who genuine - ly fall in the low-risk category. \"Many patients receive che - motherapy even though they do not need this treatment,\" Vollan says. \"They would not need to suffer serious side effects that are sometimes chronic or life-threatening.\" Physicians initially used pathology\u2014the appearance of tumors in the microscope\u2014to stratify the risk profiles of breast-cancer patients. More recently, diagnosticians started using the expression of genes associated with the tumors to gauge their risks. However, this type of ap - proach, which relies on identifying the single-helix ribo - nucleic acid (RNA) in the tumors, has two main problems. It misclassifies a substantial fraction of patients. And, as B\u00f8rresen-Dale explains, \"gene expression-based methods have the intrinsic problem of the instability of RNA.\" So her team focuses on the DNA in breast-tumor ge - nomes. \"As DNA is a more stable nucleic acid, prognostic markers based on genomic aberrations could potentially be a more reproducible test than the ones based on gene expression,\" B\u00f8rresen-Dale says. \"The type of genomic al-teration may reflect underlying mechanisms and provide information on the tumors' path of progression.\" Ole Christian Lingj\u00e6rde, another team member and a professor of medical bioinformatics at the University of Oslo, explains the rationale of focusing on tumor genomes. \"In cancer cells, changes take place in the genome, includ - ing changes in the number of copies. The changes can be very local or involve large areas in a chromosome,\" he says. \"We have focused on the situation where there are many local changes within a limited area of the genome.\" Specif - ically, the researchers studied areas of tumor genomes in which pieces of DNA had shifted, leading to missing genes or excess numbers of them.CHROMOSOMAL CLUTTERThe team developed two criteria to quantify those move - ments. They defined the whole-arm aberration index (WAAI) as the deviation from the normal number of cop - ies of DNA in a complete segment, or arm, of a chromo - some and the complex arm aberration index (CAAI) as the amount of local distortion of the DNA on an arm. \"The calculated WAAI and CAAI scores for every chromosome arm from all chromosomes revealed the architectural DNA changes in the individual tumors,\" Lingj\u00e6rde says. The researchers used the scores to differentiate among various types of breast tumors. The regions with complex genomic rearrangements \"had localized clusters of high-level amplifications of DNA, our CAAI score captured these tumors,\" B\u00f8rresen-Dale continues. \"Commonly al - tered regions combined with CAAI enabled classification of the tumors into eight distinct groups.\" Next, they applied standard statistical tools, such as Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression survival analyses, to connect the groups with patients' risks of dying from their breast cancers or suf - fering a return of the disease after appar - ently successful treat - ment. The relationship between genomic rearrangements and prognosis provides a multilayered approach to diag - nosing breast cancers. \"First, a tumor must be designated to a group, like our WAAI groups,\" B\u00f8rresen-Dale says. \"Secondly there will be applied group-specific markers for predicting therapy response.\" Their method provides an advantage beyond improved diagnostic accuracy. Unlike gene-expression studies, which require clinicians to use tumor material that was frozen quickly after a biopsy, it can use DNA extracted from tumor tissue fixed by formalin and embedded in paraffin for long-term storage. That, B\u00f8rresen-Dale points out, \"would significantly simplify implementation in rou - tine diagnostic labs.\" The Oslo team has now embarked on an effort to con - firm its results. In collaboration with groups in Vancouver, Canada, and Cambridge, U.K., it is studying 2,000 samples of breast cancer from patients in those two countries. The group is also refining the algorithms that connect local genomic alterations to prognoses of breast cancer, and ex - tending its findings to other types of cancer. In addition, B\u00f8rresen-Dale says, the team will investigate whether patients with such genomic alterations will benefit from specific treatments. With the results, physicians might measure the danger and likely outcome of an individual's breast cancer. \"With our new method, we can distinguish between patients with a good and a poor prognosis. This makes it easier to select the best treatment for the patient.\" \u2014Hans Kristian Vollan G_Math.indd 91 4/2/13 8:26 AM92 In the 1950s, Malaysia became in- dependent from Britain. In breaking away from England, the Federation of Malaya granted citizenship and prop-erty rights to Malays, Chinese and Indians. In doing so it created a small entrepreneurial class that\u2014rather than replanting rubber trees\u2014planted oil-palm trees, which produce palm oil. In ten years, Malaysia was sup-plying over 20 percent of the world's palm oil. /T_h is cash crop improved living standards, especially among indigenous peoples in rural areas. Malaysia's economy is on pace to be one of the faster growing economies in the world. Moreover, the nation's poverty\u2014roughly four percent in 2009 according to the country's department of statistics\u2014has been cut in half since 1995. Unemployment is at about In 1927, German Protestant pastor Fritz Jahr coined the term \"bioethics, \" describing the moral and philosophical re/f_l ection that the applica-tion of new science and technology requires. Nearly 90 years later, this topic cannot be ignored as the breadth and depth of biotechnol-ogy solutions encompass the globe. Indeed, with the multitude of nations participating in the \"bioeconomy, \" a fresh dialogue on bioethics\u2014particularly the social, cultural and political dimension of the related term \"geoethics\"\u2014is more timely than ever. /T_h is need for debate could be no more evident than in the ongoing battle over Malaysia's palm-oil industry. While environmental groups propose placing international controls over the production of palm oil, the imposition of foreign constraints on natural resources feels like another round of colonial-ism to Malaysians. Mid-nineteenth-century Malaysia was a loose and o/f_t en fractious feder- ation of states under the colonial rule of Great Britain. \" Advisers\" controlled Malaysia's trade, mining and plantations. /T_h e Malayan people, however, hardly bene/f_i ted from this industrialization and economic growth, since the British used Chinese and Indian labor to build infrastructure, mine the tin and extract the rubber.

Recently planted palms can be seen in the bright green grassy areas. BY ROBERT GOLDBERG G_Math.indd 92 4/2/13 12:40 PMBATTLES IN BIOETHICS Left unchecked, environmentalism can lead to bio-colonialism, the domination of bioactive energy and food sources by a small \"caste\" of characters.3.5 percent as more women enter the work force. In large part, palm oil fueled these economic advances. Seeking Balance In the name of saving the planet, en-vironmentalists\u2014like the colonialists of centuries past\u2014are seeking control of Malaysia's palm-oil production. The opponents of palm-oil production point out many potential problems. In the December 2012 Scientific Ameri-can, for example, the editors wrote: \"Converting forests into oil palm plan-tations destroys the home of not only orangutans but also such critically endangered creatures as the Sumatran tiger and the Sumatran rhino. \" They added that \"... the denuding of this land through logging and burning releases large quantities of the green-house gas carbon dioxide. Much of this forest sits on peat land, the drain-ing and burning of which releases even more carbon dioxide than the clearing of the overlying trees does. \" At times, oil-palm growing has come at the expense of orangutans and rainforest peat land. On the other hand, less than a third of the cleared forest in Malaysia supports the palm-oil industry, and most of the deforestation arises from illegal log-ging or fires. Moreover, deforestation is declining even as palm-oil produc-tion is increasing. Indeed, compared to other crops used for fuel and food sources, oil-palm trees yield more oil per hectare\u2014more than 4,000 kilo-grams, according to Oil World Annual 2008\u2014than soybeans, sunflower and rapeseed, which produce 370, 500 and 750 kilograms, respectively. This is not to suggest that environ- mental concerns over palm oil should be dismissed or sacrificed at the altar of unfettered capitalism. Rather, as the late American political scientist Aaron Wildavsky noted (paraphrased from Risk and Culture with Mary Douglas (University of California Press, 1982)): What we regard as risks, what dangers we select and how we frame risks reflects how we want society to be organized. Hence, asser- tions about risks are not necessarily scientific statements of fact. Battling Bio-Colonialism In general, multiple champions rou-tinely praise the merits of environ-mentalism while its limits are largely ignored. Left unchecked, environmen-talism can lead to bio-colonialism, the domination of bioactive energy and food sources by a small \"caste\" of characters. Like the colonial enter-prises of centuries past, bio-colonial-ists have advanced their own goals by wielding considerable influence over the use and development of biological or bioactive resources of others. For example, part of the increase in palm-oil production was in response to policies and subsidies designed to increase the use of biofuels. Many environmentalists eagerly pushed to certify biofuels as \"green\" without considering its impact on land use or indirect carbon emissions. Today's reversal of palm oil's environmental support\u2014imposing limits on its production\u2014would actually increase greenhouse gases. According to the 2010 \"Food Labeling Law and Policy Review\" from Australia's Institute of Public Affairs: \"Without palm oil[,] deforestation would still occur in the developing world. But instead of palm oil, growers would simply produce different crops, such as replacement oil seeds. Such a scenario would lead to expanded environmental degrada-tion and deforestation because of the relatively low-yield of alternatives. \" Bio-colonialism also causes other problems. For instance, small landholders account for about 40 percent of the area planted in oil palm in Malaysia, and the industry supports hundreds of thousands of workers. That is one of the reasons why the Asian Development Bank finances palm-oil projects; they are reliable sources of income that allow the bank to make loans on other activities. So increasing yields from oil palms are contributing to the investment in other industries, thus spurring greater growth. Finally, bio-colonialism is at odds with property ownership, and by extension, sustainability. International groups that regulate economic activ-ity to meet environmental goals are predicated on the assumption that the private use of property leads to the tragedy of the commons. Bio-colonialism, to paraphrase Matt Ridley, author of the best-selling book The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves (Harper, 2010), is based on the belief that individual-ism, technology and globalization are leading us headlong into hell. The tendency to despair is tied to a vision of how the world should be and not to any objective assessment of risk. The problem is: The anticipation of every technological danger\u2014whether it's nuclear power or palm oil\u2014leads to uniformity and reduces innova-tion and investment in other options. Unchecked, bio-colonialism makes societies less resilient and sustainable, not more. We all must consider the bioethics behind this conclusion.
