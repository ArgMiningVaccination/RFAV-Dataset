Our mission To improve, promote and protect the health of Western Australians by: caring for individuals and the community caring for those who need it most making the best use of funds and resources supporting our team. Our values WA Health's Code of Conduct identifies the values that we hold as fundamental in our work and describes how these values translate into action. Our values can be summarised as: Care - Respect - Excellence Integrity - Teamwork - Leadership Department of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 3Executive summary WA Health is a leading public health system that in 2012-13 performed well for the Western Australian community despite high demand for its services from the State's growing population. It also came amid change at the helm of the organisation with the departure of Kim Snowball in March 2013, after almost three years in the Director General's role. This solid performance was underpinned by long-term planning, regular and ongoing monitoring and review, innovative reform and a professional 43,000-strong workforce. Delivering a healthy WA While recognising that sections of the community experience poorer health outcomes than the rest, Western Australians as a whole enjoy an excellent standard of health, reflected in life expectancy among the best in the world and infant mortality rates among the lowest in Australia. The community benefits from effective public health programs, responsive health services and hospitals which, in the provision of patient care, meet high standards of safety and quality. WA Health continually works to improve its performance and align its efforts to the four key pillars of WA Health Strategic Intent 2010-15 : caring for individuals and the community caring for those who need it most making the best use of funds and resources supporting our team. The Department of Health is a key part of the broader health system which is responsible for health sector planning and providing advice to government. It is staffed by 850 people (full time equivalent) who work across a wide range of areas including public health, health finance, health reform, performance, activity and quality, planning and strategic direction. Western Australia's Chief Health Professions Officer, Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer, Chief Medical Officer and the Office of the Chief Psychiatrist are also part of the Department of Health. The 2012-13 year began with a major restructure of public health system governance by appointing high-level governing councils. The new governing councils are: North Metropolitan Health Service Governing Council South Metropolitan Health Service Governing Council Child and Adolescent Health Service Governing Council Northern and Remote Country Governing Council Southern Country Governing Council. Work also continued on the $7 billion infrastructure overhaul that is expanding and transforming hospitals and health facilities across Western Australia. Overview of AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 4In 2012-13 WA Health also acted on the recommendations of a far-reaching review of mental health practices in Western Australia and set the pace on national emergency department reform by outperforming all other states and territories in meeting the National Emergency Access Target. Caring for individuals and the community Through partnerships with not-for-profit agencies the Department of Health delivered a range of public health initiatives aimed at preventing chronic disease and injury. WA has always been at the forefront of tobacco control and reducing the number of smokers in Western Australia remains a priority for the Department. In 2012-13 this commitment to stamp out smoking was reaffirmed through ongoing initiatives such as Quitline, the Make Smoking History campaign and by WA's own Smoke-Free WA Health system policy. Among a range of efforts to better protect the community from vaccine-preventable diseases, the Department of Health developed the WA Immunisation Strategy 2013-15 and contributed to new national guidelines on managing Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in healthcare facilities. A new plan for dealing with extreme heatwaves was also established that allowed procedures for responding to major incidents and emergencies to be strengthened. In supporting the important work of health and medical researchers the Department of Health oversaw governance of research projects undertaken within WA Health and distributed around $15 million in research funding. Information communication technologies continued to streamline processes and enhance patient care and services. The Department of Health embraced the introduction of personally controlled electronic health records and smoothed the flow of patient information at select hospitals with the roll out of a new web-based patient administration system. Caring for those who need it most In caring for those who needed it most, efforts were focussed on emergency care, elective services, Aboriginal health, community and continuing care. In 2012-13 WA hospitals admitted, referred on or discharged more than 78 per cent of people who presented to emergency departments within four hours - surpassing the 76 per cent target set under the National Emergency Access Target program, an initiative of the National Partnership Agreement on improving public hospital services. While efforts to treat 94 per cent of elective surgery patients within the clinically recommended time fell shy of the National Elective Surgery Target, the development of a Statewide Elective Surgery Waitlist Plan and Elective Services Reform Program should aid future efforts. Overview of AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 5A range of community care initiatives were established to enhance services for people with a disability or chronic health condition and progress was made on operational plans aimed at delivering hospital and health workforce reform. Fostering strong Aboriginal leadership within the health system and raising awareness of the factors that have shaped Aboriginal views on health needs, outcomes and services were among initiatives undertaken by the Department to help improve Aboriginal health. Recipients of mental health services are set to benefit from the recommendations of three reviews undertaken by the Chief Psychiatrist's Office in 2012-13 as well as the far reaching review into the admission, referral discharge and transfer practices of public mental health facilities/services in Western Australia. Making the best use of our funds and resources Following the introduction of activity-based funding and management (ABF/ABM) in 2010-11, 76 per cent of WA Health services were funded under the ABF/ABM model in 2012-13. Several health building projects were completed including the new Albany Health Campus and the PathWest Centre at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre while construction continued on other major developments including the Fiona Stanley and new children's hospital, State Rehabilitation Service and Busselton Health Campus. The amount of revenue received from hospitals also increased following the introduction of an information technology-based patient billing and revenue collection initiative. Supporting our team People are WA Health's greatest asset and attracting and retaining the best people into the workforce is vital to maintaining a quality health system. The goal is to have the right doctors, nurses and allied health staff in the right numbers, in the right places and at the right time to meet the changing health needs of our State. In 2012-13 medical recruitment efforts turned to Ireland and the UK where a key focus was on attracting general practitioners and specialists to fill rural posts funded under the Southern Inland Health Initiative - a progressive $565 million State Government initiative that includes a $240 million investment in the health workforce. Increasing the number of Aboriginal people working in the health system is recognised as a key to lifting the health of Aboriginal people. In 2012-13 the Department embarked on a range of initiatives to attract Aboriginal people to the health workforce including the establishment of an Aboriginal cadetship program, which gave eight Aboriginal university students paid work experience while completing undergraduate education. An Aboriginal school-based traineeship program was also piloted that looked at new ways of supporting Aboriginal undergraduate nurses and midwives. Overview of AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 6WA Health enters the new year keen to consolidate and build on the achievements of 2012-13, positive about the changes that lie ahead and determined to continue serving our community with excellent health care that helps Western Australians lead healthy and fulfilling lives.

These key areas form the four pillars of our WA Health Strategic Intent 2010-2015 . WA Health is made up of more than 43,000 people, of whom 2,000 are employed by the Department of Health. The staff at the Department of Health work towards achieving the Strategic Intent through direct and indirect service provision, as well as supporting the vital functions provided by the WA public hospitals and other public health services. Our aim is to deliver a top-quality service to the WA community, regardless of income, physical location or health status. We understand the importance of strong partnerships within the healthcare community. The Department of Health collaborates with patients, the Australian Government, general practitioners, the private sector, Aboriginal and mental health sectors, non-government organisations and industry to ensure that Western Australians can receive the care they need, when they need it. Caring for individuals and the community The Department of Health contributes to the enhanced health and well being of all Western Australians. In order to care for individuals and the community, Department of Health activities focus on the key areas of: prevention, promotion, protection and intervention improving public health services improving safety and quality in health care. Prevention, promotion, protection and intervention Promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing disease Through the Chronic Disease Prevention Directorate in the System Policy and Planning Division, WA Health delivers strategies aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles. In 2012-13, The WA Health Promotion Strategic Framework 2012-2016 was released, which sets out Western Australia's strategic directions and priorities for the prevention of chronic disease and injury over the next five years. Implementation of this strategy will commence in 2013-14.Department of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 17In 2012-13, the Chronic Disease Prevention Directorate delivered chronic disease prevention initiatives through services purchased from the not-for-profit sector and provided policy support for statewide and community-based delivery of those initiatives. Areas of focus included: overweight and obesity physical inactivity injury prevention unhealthy eating smoking cessation. Obesity, nutrition and physical activity The Department of Health, through contracts with the Heart Foundation (WA Division) and the Cancer Council of WA, commenced implementation of the LiveLighter campaign. This campaign promotes a healthy lifestyle by combating poor nutrition, insufficient physical activity and obesity, which ultimately contribute to health problems such as heart disease and diabetes. The promotion of healthy lifestyles also aligns with national strategies as outlined within the Council of Australian Governments' National Partnership Agreement on Preventive Health , which extends to 2018. Measure Up local support programs The delivery of three initiatives supporting the national Swap It, Don't Stop It campaign was undertaken in 2012-13. These initiatives were the Measure Up local support program, the Non-English Speaking Background Measure Up support program and the Ngulluk Koolbaang program. Smoking cessation Reducing the number of smokers in the WA population is still considered a priority by the Department of Health as it impacts on the health of individuals by increasing the risk of diseases such as lung cancer, heart disease and emphysema. Through the purchase of services, initiatives such as the Make Smoking History\u00ae campaign and Quitline, as well as the Smoke Free WA Health System policy, are implemented to promote smoking cessation. These initiatives will continue into 2013-14. Injury prevention Injury prevention campaigns are a continued initiative for the Department of Health, with renewed service agreements with non-government organisations for delivery of programs for falls prevention, farm safety, child safety and water safety. These programs are to be supported in the upcoming year, and include Stay on Your Feet WA\u00ae; Living Longer, Living Stronger\u00ae; seasonal childhood injury prevention; Don't Drink and Drown ; and Keep Watch programs. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 18Communicable disease control The Communicable Disease Control Directorate, within Public Health and Clinical Services Department of Health continued to educate and support the Western Australian public in the prevention of communicable diseases. In 2012-13, the Communicable Disease Control Directorate developed the Western Australian Immunisation Strategy 2013-2015 , as well as implementing several initiatives and campaigns aimed at improved compliance with immunisation. The year also saw extensive involvement in the national surveillance of health care associated infections in conjunction with the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare, as well as the establishment of an expert advisory group and development of new guidelines for the management of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in health care facilities. Protecting our population Environmental health The Environmental Health Directorate within Public Health and Clinical Services, is responsible for providing protection for the WA population through the development and implementation of policies that protect our people from potential health problems that arise from our environment. In 2012-13, the Environmental Health Directorate began to develop draft supporting guidelines for the implementation of the proposed Public Health Bill as part of the Public Health Bill Implementation Plan. Preparing for and responding to disasters The Disaster Management, Response and Preparedness Directorate, within Public Health and Clinical Services, undertake initiatives aimed at minimising risks to the health of the WA public. In 2012-13, the Disaster Management, Response and Preparedness Directorate ,in conjunction with the State Emergency Service, developed the new Westplan Heatwave (2012) to deal with a heatwave emergency. It also reviewed the existing Westplan Health plan to guide prevention, preparation, response to and recovery from major incidents. In addition to these, and in response to a Premier's circular in 2012, the Disaster Management, Response and Preparedness Directorate has also been involved in the establishment of building protection zones as part of a Department of Fire and Emergency Services bush fire safety initiative. This will also be ongoing in 2013-14. Disaster Management, Response and Preparedness Directorate also coordinate the Western Australian Medical Assistance Team - an emergency group of medical professionals who deploy to the site of a disaster at short notice to provide short-term medical support. In 2012-13, WebEOC, a web-based crisis information management system, as well as integration of the AllocateMe application, which streamlines casualty allocation in major incidents,continued to be rolled out. These initiatives will facilitate better response to an emergency and continue to be implemented in 2013-14. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 19Medicines, poisons and therapeutic goods In 2012-13, the Disaster Management, Response and Preparedness Directorate completed the Regulatory Impact Statement for the draft of the new Medicines, Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Bill. Progression of this Bill through Parliament will occur in 2013-14 and consultation on the regulations to underpin the new legislation will begin. The development and approval of the Schedule 8 Medicines (drugs of dependence) Prescribing Code and supporting policies and tools, designed to ensure a risk-based approach to the regulation of these medicines were also undertaken. During 2013-2014, a comprehensive monitoring program will be implemented against the criteria of the Schedule 8 Medicines Prescribing Code. Early interventions and preventions A 2012 report from the WA Cancer Forum provided the basis to update the WA Cancer and Palliative Care Network cancer framework and refocus priorities in 2012-13. The WA Cancer and Palliative Care Network is well positioned to implement a comprehensive cancer control strategy, for which many of the foundations are already in place. WA Cancer and Palliative Care Network aims to continue support initiatives into 2013-14, through improving cancer control activities, identifying strategies for workforce sustainability, continuing collaborative partnerships for prevention campaigns, and supporting cancer control activities across Western Australia through research and evaluation. Research and development to prevent and protect Research and development is critical to ensure that the WA Health service remains at the forefront of international standards for quality of treatment as well as understanding the causes of illness and injury. The Department of Health has a central role in securing funding to enable research and development, as well and ensuring governance over research and development in WA Health. A State Government election commitment, Futurehealth WA, provided an additional injection of funding for health and medical research to the value of $30 million over four years. The Office of the Chief Medical Officer within the Department of Health will implement this initiative starting in the 2013-14 financial year, including a new funding structure which encourages complementary corporate and philanthropic investment. Other funding initiatives implemented by the Office of the Chief Medical Officer in the 2012-13 financial year were aimed at issues of significance to WA Health, improving cost effectiveness and/or efficiencies, supporting clinicians/healthcare professionals and supporting research infrastructure. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 20Other funding included: $6.8 million for research projects and Clinician Research Fellowships $2 million as part of the initiation of the Telethon - New Children's Hospital Research Fund grant program, jointly funded with the Channel 7 Telethon Trust support for the Australian Telehealth Research and Development Group in partnership with the CSIRO Australian e-Health Research Centre $5.8 million to the Medical and Health Research Infrastructure Fund. These initiatives and funding programs will continue into the new financial year. Improving public hospital services Innovation in health service delivery Through the Innovation and Health System Reform operations area, the Department of Health continued to implement the WA Health Clinical Services Framework 2010-2020 . This framework sets out the planned structure of public health service provision in Western Australia over the next 10 years 2010 to 2020. It is an important tool for strategic statewide planning and will assist health services in developing localised clinical service plans. The Clinical Services Framework 2010-2020 also informs statewide plans and submissions for workforce, infrastructure, ICT and budgets. In 2012-13 clinical service plans were developed across WA health service areas that included initiatives such as the continued progress of the Elective Services Reform Program, initiation of clinical redesign projects and a review of specialty level role delineation of public hospitals across the State. Although the Clinical Services Framework 2010-2020 was due for refresh for the period 2015-2025, rapid changes to the population and to the social and economic status of the State have outpaced the changes to WA Health that were planned back in 2009. Based on these changes, it has become necessary to commence preparation for a new clinical services framework a year earlier than scheduled. Preparation for a new clinical services framework has commence, with completion expected in early 2014. Implementation projects under the endorsed Elective Services Reform Program policy will also begin in 2014. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 21Information and communication technologies The Health Information Network works towards improving our public hospital services by implementing innovations in information and communications technologies. In June 2012, the Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records (PCEHR) Act 2012 and associated Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records (Consequential Amendments) Act 2012 were passed as Federal Legislation. As such, healthcare organisations wishing to participate in the eHealth record system must now comply with technical specifications and requirements as outlined in the PCEHR Rules 2012. This legislation represented a significant issue for the Health Information Network and as such, in 2012-13 an eHealth Memorandum of Understanding was finalised and significant contributions were made to the PCEHR rules development. The Health Information Network also commenced the development of the WA Health ICT Strategic Plan 2013-2023 , with a view to implement by October 2013. In 2012-13, Health Information Network delivered several initiatives into the public hospital system to improve the flow of patient information. WebPAS - a web-based patient administration system was deployed to four metropolitan hospitals and across the Great Southern region. In addition, Health Information Network rolled out the clinical management system (iCM) and new identity and access management systems to Albany Hospital as part of the new hospital build. At Fiona Stanley Hospital, 48 core Information and Communication Technology systems were identified for implementation within the hospital and these systems are being progressively updated, intergrated and configured in readiness for its opening. The systems are a mixture of current systems, such as iCM and the laboratory information system, and new systems, including the notification and clinical summary system and the e-forms and electronic health record system. The successful connection of WA Health to the Medicare Health Identifiers service was also completed in 2012-13 which gives healthcare providers access to a summary of patients' health information, making continuity of care easier and contribute to improved treatment decisions and positive health outcomes. Improving safety and quality in health care Providing appropriate care to individuals and the community requires care to be provided to the highest safety and quality standards. The Office of Safety and Quality in Healthcare within Performance, Activity and Quality, has responsibility for overseeing the development, implementation and monitoring of State patient safety and quality programs, policies and standards across WA Health. In 2012-13, the Office of Safety and Quality in Health Care continued to oversee the administration and development of the Safety and Quality Investment for Reform (SQuIRe) Program in WA public hospitals, which aims to ensure the delivery of safe, high-quality, evidence-based health care to patients and the community. The 2012-13 year also saw the development of the new four-year WA Strategic Plan for Safety and Quality in Health Care 2013-2017 , which will be implemented in 2013-14. To ensure continued excellence in health care, the Office of Safety and Quality in Health Care will continue to oversee the development, implementation and monitoring of state patient safety and quality programs, policies and standards across WA Health, including continued reforms through the SQuIRe program. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 22Patient feedback is an important means for collecting information about service quality and should be used to improve healthcare delivery. The Office of the Chief Psychiatrist received approximately 33 complaints or issues per month regarding mental health care from patients, family members or advocates seeking advice or intervention in 2012-13. This feedback was used by the clinically trained members of the Office of the Chief Psychiatrist to liaise with the patient, family members and clinicians directly in order to improve future service quality. The Licensing and Accreditation Regulatory Unit within Performance, Activity and Quality is responsible for the licensing and monitoring of private hospitals in WA, ensuring that West Australians have access to high-quality and safe health care irrespective of whether they are treated in a public or private facility. In 2012-13 the Licensing and Accreditation Regulatory Unit continued to license private hospitals, private day hospitals, private nursing posts, and private psychiatric hostels throughout Western Australia. In addition, and in conjunction with the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care, they implemented the new National Health Service Accreditation Scheme as well as 10 National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards in the WA health system. In 2013-14, licensing of privately run healthcare providers will continue. Caring for those who need it most The Department of Health works towards achieving its strategic intent of \"caring for those who need it most\" through initiatives directed at these specific higher needs groups. Our public health system strives to achieve equity of service delivery and access of services to those people who need them most. Key areas of focus include: emergency care elective services community and continuing care Closing the Gap. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 23Emergency care Many patients that present to an emergency department will require ongoing care in a specialist ward, and will be admitted into hospital. A shorter time frame between initial presentation to the emergency department and admission into a ward ensures patients receive treatment more specific to their needs, faster. The National Emergency Access Target initiative, part of the Council of Australian Governments' National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services, aims to achieve a four hour National Emergency Access Target, where a target percentage of all patients presenting to a public hospital emergency department will either physically leave the emergency department for admission to hospital, be referred to another hospital for treatment, or be discharged within four hours. For the 2012-13 period, WA Health's targets and results are as follows: 2012 Early 2013 Target: 76.0% Outcome: target Outcome: below target WA Health's success at achieving the National Emergency Access Target can be attributed to the ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the Four Hour Rule Program Progress and Issues Review (December 2011) through the efforts of the Innovation and Health System Reform. The 2013-14 period will see continued efforts throughout WA Health to achieve the 2013 National Emergency Access Target of 81 per cent via Clinical Service Redesign methodology and the Clinical Reform Network. The implementation of Information Communication Technology innovations throughout metropolitan and regional emergency departments is also expected to deliver future efficiencies that will contribute to achieving the National Emergency Access Target in the future. Elective services Elective surgery describes surgery that is medically necessary, however can be delayed for at least 24 hours. As such, there can be varying levels of urgency for the surgery depending upon the clinical description. The National Elective Surgery Target initiative, part of the Council of Australian Governments' National Partnership Agreement on Improving Public Hospital Services, aims for all patients waiting for surgery to be seen within the clinically recommended time for their procedure. Ultimately, this will reduce the number of patients who have waited longer than the clinically recommended time. In 2012-13, the Innovation and Health System Reform division developed a statewide Elective Surgery Waitlist Plan to assist WA Health achieve the National Elective Surgery Target. It includes projection, audit tools and strategies to improve effectiveness and efficiency, which will be implemented in 2013-14. In addition, the Innovation and Health System Reform have established the Elective Services Reform Program, which brings together four discrete, but related projects which will reform and redesign elective services and the planned patient pathway. This program will be further progressed in the upcoming year, including the launch of the Central Referral Service. Achieving the Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 24National Elective Surgery Target will become more challenging in the near future for WA Health, as the range of procedures which the target is based on (i.e. reportable procedures) will be expanded to include a number of additional procedures which have not previously counted towards national targets (i.e. non-reportable procedures). Community and continuing care In 2012-13, the Community Health Network, within the System, Policy and Planning division, worked towards improving services for chronic conditions in the community by establishing contracts for the Better Health Improvement program initiatives, such as the Metropolitan Healthy Lifestyle program, the Chronic Condition Self-Management program and an Integrated Diabetes and Endocrinology Service. Another significant achievement for this directorate was the establishment of the Disability Health Network, which aims to provide a well-resourced advisory service within WA Health to assist practitioners to provide effective assessment, treatment and care planning for people with disabilities in the health care system. The implementation and operation of this network will be supported throughout 2013-14. The Aged and Continuing Care Directorate continued their work towards completing operational plans that aim to deliver the Council of Australian Governments' National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform - Schedule C 'Subacute Care' as well as establishing formal agreement of approved business plans for Schedule E 'New Subacute Beds Guarantee Funding' initiatives. The directorate also continued implementing initiatives relating to the Long Stay Younger People with Disabilities, Friend in Need Emergency, Transition Care, and Home and Community Care programs. In 2013-14, the Aged and Continuing Care Directorate will continue to oversee the operation of Schedule C funded projects, and assist to enhance services where possible, as well as transitioning activity and funding to the health service base funding for projects post expiry of agreement in June 2013. In addition, the number of subacute care beds and bed-equivalents will be increased according to agreed business case submissions and timelines in order to achieve Schedule E growth requirements. Closing the Gap Aboriginal Health within System Policy and Planning works towards improving the health of Aboriginal people in line with the Council of Australian Governments' Closing the Gap initiative. In 2012-13, Aboriginal Health facilitated the implementation of the Aboriginal Cultural Learning Framework across the Department of Health. This framework is aimed at improving health outcomes for Aboriginal people by addressing a better understanding of the cultural and historic reasons why and how Aboriginal people view health needs, outcomes and services differently to the general population. This framework will continue Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 25to be implemented throughout 2013-14 and will include compulsory cultural e-learning across WA Health. The 2012-13 Aboriginal Health also reviewed of the Aboriginal Health Impact Statement and Guidelines, which will be implemented in the 2013-14. Another initiative developed and implemented by Aboriginal Health in 2012-13 was the WA Health Aboriginal Leadership Strategy 2013-2016 . This strategy aims to improve Aboriginal health by listening to, and enabling, strong Aboriginal leadership within the WA Health system. In 2013-14, the Aboriginal Leadership Strategy will increase opportunities for Aboriginal people to be involved in WA Health decision making. In addition, promotion of WA Health Senior Aboriginal Leadership Group members will occur, with member activities to include chairing of action learning groups to lead projects that will have a significant impact on the health of Aboriginal people. In 2013-14, Aboriginal Health will develop a WA Health Strategic Aboriginal Health Plan which will consolidate current and past efforts to improve Aboriginal health to achieve clear future directions. This strategic plan will align with the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Plan 2013-2023 and support its implementation within Western Australia. It will also guide policy and program design for improving the health and social determinants of the health of Aboriginal people. Mental health services The forthcoming Mental Health Act 2013 aims to provide for the treatment, care, support and protection of people who have a mental illness and their rights. The Chief Psychiatrist's Office will continue to advise on the pragmatic impact on clinical service delivery of proposed inclusions in this Act. In 2012-13, the Chief Psychiatrist's Office completed three reviews of mental health services: Admission, Risk Assessment, Management Plans, Outcome Measures, Use of the Mental Health Act and Discharge Planning Processes in WA Public Mental Health Services Physical Health Care Report - Baseline Clinical Governance Climate in WA Mental Health. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 26Making best use of our funds and resources As a government agency, the Department of Health uses public funding to achieve its mission of delivering high quality, appropriate health services to the Western Australian public. The Department of Health intends to deliver its objectives by \"Making best use of our funds and resources\", achieved through: activity based funding and management investment in capital works and infrastructure procurement of facilities and equipment performance management and reporting good financial management. Activity based funding and management The activity based funding and management initiative was instigated at a national level as a part of the National Health Reform Agreement 2011. It is a means of funding public healthcare in Western Australia on the basis of expected activity and provides a clear and open link between the money allocated by government and the health services delivered to patients and the community. In Western Australia, the activity based funding and management initiative is led by the Performance, Activity and Quality Division, who develop policies and programs that support its implementation in WA public hospitals. In 2012-13, 76 per cent of WA Health services were activity based funded. The year saw continued development and implementation of the activity based funding and management operating mode, which included the implementation of a nationally consistent approach to activity based funding and management for admitted acute, emergency department and hospital based outpatient services from July 2012. Other achievements included: Implementation of the Performance Management Framework 2012-2013 and Performance Management Report, including reporting performance indicators. Continued development and administration of the operational model that directs how the funds allocated to WA Health are distributed to Health Services and public hospitals in WA. Development of the Health Activity Purchasing Intentions 2013-14 . Continued work with national bodies such as the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, National Health Performance Authority and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care to ensure that proposed national policies on activity based funding and management and safety and quality are appropriate for the needs of the WA community. The 2013-14 year will see continued implementation and support of the activity based funding and management initiative and related projects and the refinement of existing projects, with a view to achieve implementation of the full national activity based funding and management model in Western Australia by 1 July 2015. This will involve the implementation and reporting of the Performance Management Framework 2013-2014 from 1 July 2013 and a new governance framework aimed at supporting the operation of the activity based funding and management initiative and improving the quality of clinical costing in WA public hospitals. Other activities critical to the implementation of activity based funding and management includes the development of the Health Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 27Activity Purchasing Intentions 2014-15 , as well as continued work with the Australian Government as the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority, National Health Performance Authority and the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. Refinements will also extend to the activity based funding and management operational model, including further alignment of this model to national Weighted Activity Units, as required through the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. Investment in capital works and infrastructure The 2012-13 year saw continued progress on major infrastructure projects across Western Australia, aimed at improving the delivery of health services to both metropolitan and country populations. Perth metropolitan area Projects included: the new children's hospital development continued on the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre site continued construction of the Fiona Stanley Hospital and State Rehabilitation Service the expansion of services and facilities continued at the Joondalup Health Campus, which is nearing completion continued construction on the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre site, including the car park, State Mortuary extension, and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital Mental Health Unit. completion of the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital Cancer Centre Stage 2, the new PathWest Centre and Central Energy Plant at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre site commencement of construction on the new Midland Health Campus, due to open in 2015, and will deliver modern, integrated health care to Perth's growing north eastern corridor. WA country areas Projects included: completion of the new Albany Health Campus in March 2013 commencement of construction on the third stage of the Kalgoorlie Health Campus development commencement of construction on the new Busselton Health Campus in September 2012. Planning also continued for new projects: Karratha Health Campus Southern Inland Health Initiative funded by Royalties for Regions and includes $325.3 million to improve infrastructure for integrated district health services; primary health centres; small hospitals and nursing posts; telehealth; and residential aged and dementia care. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 28The successful implementation of these major projects also relies on the planning of operational facilities. For example, in 2012-13, the Health Information Network continued its preparation of the information and communication technologies for various sites including the new state-of-the-art Fiona Stanley Hospital. It remediated 78 applications and operational software for use in managing patient information. The implementation and ongoing maintenance of operational support will continue into 2013-14. Performance management and reporting The Performance Directorate, in the Performance, Activity and Quality oversees the monitoring, reporting, development and management of information and related business systems for strategic and operational directives within WA Health. This function is important for reporting against targets and facilitates transparency and improvements to efficiency and quality of the WA health service. In 2012-2013, the Performance Directorate supported the implementation of the National Health Reform Agreemen t through the collection and reporting of data for the Performance and Accountability Framework and governing councils as well as participation on the National jurisdictional advisory committee in performance reporting (NHPA Jurisdictional Advisory Committee) to provide input into the production of Hospital Performance and Healthy Communities reports. Improvements in reporting will be the focus for 2013-14, with a major review of the outcome based management framework and associated key performance indicators reported as part of the WA Health annual reports. Good financial management and fund allocation The Performance, Activity and Quality is involved in a wide variety of tasks relating to health finance and economic analysis. In 2012-13, patient level costs for emergency department and non-admitted patients and inpatient hospital costing data was submitted to the National Hospital Cost Data Collection for the first time, as required by the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority. In 2013-14, Performance, Activity and Quality will implement recommendations made by the National Hospital Cost Data Collection Strategic Review with the aim of improving governance of the National Hospital Cost Data Collection and collection methodology. The upcoming year will also see further efforts directed to achieving greater compliance with the Australian Hospital Patient Costing Standards. In 2012-13, the Health Information Network contributed to improved financial management through the successful deployment of the Patient Billing and Revenue Collection initiative at Fremantle, Swan Districts and Albany Hospitals. This significant advancement in information technology has already paid off, with improved revenue resulting from increased patient invoicing at these sites. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 29Supporting our team Each staff member within WA Health has an integral role in ensuring that Western Australians lead healthier, longer and better lives. It is therefore important that our health system has the best possible workforce that is supported to enable them to provide the best possible service. The following key areas are a focus for WA Health: improving our workforce nursing Aboriginal employment. Improving our workforce Improving the WA Health workforce involves attracting and retaining high quality and key staff, ensuring continual improvement through effective and targeted training programs, and workforce reform. Strategy and workforce reform Several key workforce reform strategies are currently under development or implementation across the Department of Health. The Officer of the Chief Medical Officer in 2012-13 continued extensive specialist workforce mapping as part of the Specialist Workforce Capacity Program. This program, in conjunction with national data reported by Health Workforce Australia, informs planning for current and projected specialist workforce shortages in WA. The 2013-14 year will see further progression of the program outcomes in alignment with national strategies to plan for and accommodate the increasing numbers of junior doctors, as well as the development of workforce frameworks for other identified specialties. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 30In 2012-13, the Officer of the Chief Medical Officer developed the Generalist Medical Workforce Development Framework - a policy framework for WA Health to undertake a 'whole of health' approach in improving and promoting a sustainable, high quality general medical workforce. This initiative will be achieved through the development of a cross-sectional, cross-regional planning model that strengthens the workforce and increase training capacity across the public and private health sectors, and will be progressed in 2013-14. Also intended for 2013-14 is the development of a workforce framework for general practitioners, in conjunction with WA General Practice Education and Training. The Nursing and Midwifery Office also has a strong role in workplace sustainability and reform. In 2012-13, two strategies for reform were under focus as a means of addressing staffing issues for nursing. The first, the Nursing Hours per Patient Day based reporting, seeks to ensure ward-based nursing workloads are kept reasonable and are able to be accurately measured and managed. Reasonable workloads helps to both maintain high quality patient care and improve the prospect of retaining nursing staff. A new Nursing Hours per Patient Day system was implemented in the 2012-13 year to seamlessly collate nursing staffing and bed occupancy data for performance measurement, and to provide timely feedback that can assist in determining appropriate nursing staffing levels, whether targets are achieved, and will facilitate activity based funding/management initiatives. A second initiative, Assistants in Nursing, also seeks to increase the prospect of retaining our experienced nursing staff by introducing a new category of healthcare staff that work alongside nurses in acute care environments and undertake tasks that support nurses in their clinical roles. In 2012-13, WA Health provided Assistants in Nursing training within a traineeship model and employed Assistants in Nursing as part of the larger strategic plan to address both health workforce sustainability and patient safety. Attracting key staff In 2012-13, the Workforce Directorate within Resource Strategy worked on many initiatives aimed at attracting the best and most appropriate staff to WA Health. A significant focus was on the International Recruitment Bureau, London Office, where an emphasis on attracting United Kingdom (UK) and Irish doctors and nursing staff to work in the public health care system in Western Australia. Marketing was refined with a focus on registration and migration requirements, attracting general practitioners and specialists to rural posts as part of Royalties for Regions' funded Southern Inland Health Initiative, strengthening relationships with UK universities and maintaining an active recruitment program. Further refinements to the international recruitment efforts will occur in 2013-14, with continued emphasis on the alignment of specific demand modelling for skilled health professionals in WA, with targeted recruitment activities in the best source countries for the supply of those staff. Key relationships in the UK and Ireland will be maintained, as well as continued research of the UK and Irish workforce market so as to identify new opportunities and marketing strategies. The Office of the Chief Medical Officer also implemented initiatives in 2012-13 that focused on effective workforce recruitment. One initiative was the Area of Need program which facilitates employment of international medical graduates in specified areas of need. The year saw efforts aimed at streamlining Area of Need administrative processes following recommendations identified in the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing's Lost in the Labyrinth: Report on the inquiry into the registration process and support for overseas trained doctors , tabled in March 2012. The program will continue to be supported throughout 2013-14. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 31Retaining staff In 2012-13, the Workforce Directorate worked on the WA Health Workforce Retention Framework 2012-2015, and Implementation Guide, as a means for optimising employee retention. Other efforts aimed at retention and workforce sustainability included ongoing improvements to the sustainability and consistency of Workforce Supply and Demand models. Staff training Several initiatives aimed at continuous improvement of the WA Health workforce were progressed throughout 2012-13. The Workforce Directorate established the WA Clinical Training Network and delivered a Clinical Supervision Support Program, which is a statewide, multi-sector training package. Australian Government funding for this program has been secured for 2013-14 so as to facilitate a transition to a sustainable model for WA Health. In addition to this program, the $21 million Australian Government funded Clinical Training Fund Program was also implemented, which has delivered a 60 per cent increase in clinical training activity by WA Health since 2010. In 2013-14 several projects will be implemented including mapping current activity and capacity, developing an efficient and transparent clinical training placement system and identifying new sources of training places. Nursin g The strategic goals of the Nursing and Midwifery Office remain firmly focused on delivering a sustainable and flexible nursing and midwifery workforce through three key policy areas - retention, attraction and workforce reform. During 2012-13, this strategic focus has led to the initiation and continuation of a range of Nursing and Midwifery Office led projects, many will continue into 2013-14. Leading great care for retention and reform In partnership with Notre Dame University, the Nursing and Midwifery Office created the 'Leading Great Care' program which began in 2012-13. This initiative is focused on developing and extending the skills of frontline nursing and midwifery leadership personnel, who are key to WA Health achieving highly efficient, effective and continuously improving evidence- based patient care. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 32The year ahead Many workforce challenges face WA Health, with Health Workforce Australia estimating that by 2025, Western Australia will face a shortage of more than 10,000 nurses. These are expected to arise from a surge in \"baby-boomer\" retirements and expected demand-driven health system growth at rates greater than recruitment. Conversely, additional university nursing places in recent years is expected to produce more graduate registered nurses than WA Health employers can accommodate in the short term, especially as we await expected global financial crisis-stalled retirements to occur and new infrastructure projects to become operational. These challenges are coupled with the requirement for ongoing reform. Accordingly, the Nursing and Midwifery Office's priorities in 2013-14 include: increasing the promotion of nursing and midwifery building on partnerships with the Aboriginal community through the Aboriginal Nursing and Midwifery Leadership group and the Aboriginal Health Service to facilitate Aboriginal people to develop careers in nursing and midwifery, and promoting the Aboriginal nursing cadetship and mentoring program increasing the male composition in the nursing and midwifery workforce to 20 per cent by 2020 achieving and maintaining a balance between supply and employment models for nursing and midwifery graduates embedding the newly created Leading Great Care program leading the national agenda in advanced nursing practice models, including nurse practitioner candidacy, nurse practitioner peer review and credentialing, nurse prescribing, and the pursuit of associated legislative changes. Marketing nursing and midwifery careers for attraction In 2012-13 marketing campaigns were revised to attract people to careers in nursing and midwifery, or to encourage them to return to these careers. Mediums included establishing a Facebook presence, launching the 'GREaT' work experience program and refreshing the career guidance support materials. Aboriginal employment In 2012-13, eight Aboriginal university students were offered the opportunity to gain paid work experience while completing an undergraduate degree, through the WA Health Aboriginal cadetship program implemented by the Workforce Directorate. The program allowed these cadets to become involved in WA Health initiatives such as the 'Quit Smoking' campaign for Aboriginal communities. The upcoming year will see the Workforce Directorate transition the program to an appropriate long term custodian. In 2012-13 Workforce Directorate, in conjunction with Aboriginal Health, conducted an extensive statewide consultation on Aboriginal health worker priority training needs. This lead to 40 Aboriginal health workers upgrading their qualifications, making them eligible for national registration as an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Practitioner. A further 80 Aboriginal health workers received accredited training in Aboriginal ear and hearing health. More Aboriginal health workers will be assisted to attain registration. Further findings from the consultation process will be implemented. Significant Issues Impacting the AgencyDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 33In 2012-13, Aboriginal Health also supported increased Aboriginal training and employment through an Aboriginal school-based traineeship program pilot program for WA Health. Aboriginal Health also reviewed the current scholarship program through partnerships with Aboriginal university centres. These partnerships will be developed in 2013-14 to strengthen the capacity of Aboriginal people to access extra-curricular education, with the aim of increasing the number of Aboriginal health employees. In 2013-14 the Aboriginal Workforce Strategy 2013-2018 will also be developed and launched, with a focus on and continued program evaluation. The Nursing and Midwifery Office is working with WA Health employers and the Aboriginal Health to bring supportive cadetship opportunities to Aboriginal undergraduate nurses and midwives, with a view to ensuring course completion, cadet-based employment and retention following graduation. In 2012-13 the first Aboriginal cadet was enrolled, with a second starting in 2013-14. It is hoped that up to 10 Aboriginal cadets will be enrolled in this program within the next five years. In addition to the cadetship program, the Nursing and Midwifery Office also funded scholarships and mentors to support new entrant Aboriginal nurses and midwives as they access their studies. This initiative has seen record numbers enter studies in 2012. In addition, the Aboriginal Nursing and Midwifery Leadership Committee was re-established to assist the Nursing and Midwifery Office implement the WA Aboriginal Nursing and Midwifery Strategic Plan 2011-2015 .

The legal entities are: Department of Health Metropolitan Health Service WA Country Health Service Queen Elizabeth II Medical CentreTrust Quadriplegic Centre. The Department of Health, Metropolitan Health Service and WA Country Health Service annual reports2 are produced by the Performance, Activity and Quality of the Department of Health, in collaboration with all relevant entity budget holders. Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre Trust and the Quadriplegic Centre are responsible for meeting their respective annual reporting requirements. Under section 61 of the Financial Management Act 2006 and Treasurer's Instruction 904, WA Health entities are required to present annual indicators of performance to Parliament and the public through the annual reports. This performance information includes key performance indicators. The key performance indicators are reported to enable stakeholders to assess WA Health's performance in achieving government desired outcomes and the delivery of services. WA Health outcomes and services To comply with its legislative obligation as a Western Australian government agency, WA Health operates under the \"Outcome Based Management\" performance management framework3. This framework describes how outcomes, services and key performance indicators are used to measure agency performance towards achieving the relevant, overarching whole-of-government goal. WA Health's key performance indicators measure the effectiveness and efficiency of the services provided by WA Health in achieving the stated desired health outcomes. All WA Health reporting entities contribute to the achievement of the outcomes through health services delivered either directly by the entities or indirectly through contracts with non-government organisations. WA Health's outcomes and 2012-13 Annual Report key performance indicators are aligned to the State Government goal (see Figure 1). 1 http://www.treasury.wa.gov.au/cms/uploadedFiles/_Treasury/Legislation/fab_update.pdf 2 http://www.health.wa.gov.au/publications/annual_reports.cfm 3 http://www.treasury.wa.gov.au/cms/uploadedFiles/_Treasury/Publications/Outcome_Based_Management.pdfDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 41Figure 1: WA Health outcomes and services aligned to the State Government goal WA Strategic Outcome (Whole of Government) Outcome-based service delivery: Greater focus on achieving results in key service delivery areas for the benefit of all Western Australians.

Outcome 2: Enhanced health and well-being of Western Australians through health promotion, illness and injury prevention and appropriate continuing care. All health entities contribute to the achievement of these outcomes, with different health service divisions taking responsibility for specific areas. As such, the overall performance of WA Health should be determined by reading, in conjunction, the annual reports for the Department of Health, Metropolitan Health Service and WA Country Health Service. WA Health activities that are aligned to Outcome 1 and 2 are cited below. Activities related to Outcome 1 aim to: ensure that people have appropriate and timely access to acute care services when they are in need of them so that intervention occurs as early as possible provide quality diagnostic and treatment services that ensure the maximum restoration to health after an acute illness or injury provide appropriate after-care and rehabilitation to ensure that people's physical and social functioning is restored as far as possible provide appropriate obstetric care during pregnancy and the birth episode to both mother and child provide appropriate care and support for patients and their families during terminal illness. Activities related to Outcome 2 aim to: increase the likelihood of optimal health and wellbeing by: providing programs which support the optimal physical, social and emotional development of infants and children encouraging healthy lifestyles (e.g. diet and exercise). reduce the likelihood of onset of disease or injury through: immunisation programs safety programs. reduce the risk of long-term disability or premature death from injury or illness through prevention, early identification and intervention, such as: programs for early detection of developmental issues in children and appropriate referral for intervention early identification and intervention of disease and disabling conditions, for example breast and cervical cancer screening; and screening of newborns, with appropriate referrals programs that support self-management by people with diagnosed conditions and disease (such as diabetic education). monitor the incidence of disease in the population to determine the effectiveness of primary health measures. providing continuing care services and programs that improve and enhance the wellbeing and the environment for people with chronic illness or disability. Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 43Key performance indicators The suite of 2012-13 WA Health key performance indicators consists of key effectiveness indicators and key efficiency indicators that aim to cover each Outcome and each Service respectively. Combined, these key performance indicators report the extent to which the strategies and activities of WA Health contribute to achieving the agency's outcomes. Each key performance indicator, within the approved suite of indicators, has been defined to: ensure accuracy and consistency in data collection, collation and analysis support the interpretation of a key performance indicators in terms of what is being measured allow for comparisons across WA Health services support the audit process conducted by the Office of Auditor General. The health of the Western Australian community has many determinants, including the provision of health services, access to and use of other government services and numerous environmental and social factors. Key performance indicator reporting requirements WA Health is required under an Act of Parliament, as well as the Treasurer's Instructions, to present key performance indicators to Parliament. The Office of the Auditor General will perform an interim audit of information systems, followed by a final audit of key performance indicators. For those key performance indicators related to Outcome 2, the findings may be presented by Aboriginality if the data is available and meaningful.

Comparative results Where possible, comparative results for prior years are provided. Performance targets Effectiveness indicator targets have been based on published national averages for performance indicators where available, or from the analysis of previous performance results. Efficiency indicator targets are derived from the 2012-13 Government Budget Statements and may get revised in the 2013-14 Government Budget Statements. Targets have also been developed by performance reporting within Performance, Activity and Quality and/or key stakeholders where national targets are not available. Consumer price index deflator series All efficiency indicators are reported as both actual and Consumer Price Index adjusted figures. The indexed figures are derived from the Consumer Price Index all groups, weighted average of the eight capital cities index numbers. For the financial year series, the index is the average of the December and March quarters and is rebased to reflect a mid year point of the five year series that appears in the annual reports. The average of the December and March quarters is used, because the full year index series is not available in time for the annual reporting cycle. Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 45Efficiency indicators The efficient use of resources can help minimise the overall costs of providing health care. While it is important to monitor the unit cost of the various components of hospital care and health care services in order to ensure overall quality and cost effectiveness, it should be noted that variations in patient characteristics and clinic service types between sites and across time, can result in differences in service delivery costs. Mental health The Mental Health Commission of Western Australia has assumed the policy control and management for the provision of mental health services in Western Australia. The mental health efficiency indicators reported in the Department of Health report represent services provided under agreement with the Mental Health Commission. Service descriptions 1. Public hospital admitted patients Public hospital admitted patient services describe services provided to patients admitted into public hospitals, or admitted as public patients into privately managed hospitals that are under contract to the Department of Health (excluding specialised mental health wards). An admission to hospital can be for a period of one or more days and includes medical and surgical treatment, renal dialysis, oncology services, and obstetric care. 2. Home-based hospital programs The home based hospital service can be provided for patients who can be safely cared for without constant monitoring, and for conditions traditionally requiring hospital admission and inpatient treatment. This service is provided by the Health Services and non-government providers and involves daily home visits by nurses, with medical governance - usually by a hospital-based doctor. This service is delivered through programs such as Hospital in the Home, Rehabilitation in the Home and Mental Health in the Home, which provide short-term acute care in the patient's home, and the Friend in Need Emergency program, which delivers care interventions for older and chronically ill patients with a range of short term clinical care requirements. 3. Palliative care Palliative care services describe inpatient and home based multidisciplinary care and support for terminally ill people and their families and carers. Education and advisory services are also available to assist health care professionals, particularly those in rural areas. Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 464. Emergency department Emergency department services describe the treatment provided to people with the sudden onset of illness or injury requiring urgent medical attention. An emergency department can provide a range of services, and patients attending an emergency department may be admitted to hospital or be treated without admission. The service includes privately managed contracted emergency services, however not all public hospitals provide emergency department services. 5. Public hospital non-admitted patients Medical officers, nurses and allied health staff provide non-admitted (outpatient) care services which include clinics for pre and post-surgical care, allied health care and medical care, as well as emergency services provided in small rural hospitals that are not included under the emergency department service. 6. Patient transport Patient transport services assist patients in reaching appropriate and timely access to medical treatment. The service includes St John Ambulance Western Australia and the Royal Flying Doctor Service (Western Operations), which assist patients in need of urgent medical treatment. Also included is the Patient Assisted Travel Scheme, which provides a subsidy towards the cost of travel and accommodation for eligible permanent country residents, and their approved escorts, who are required to travel a long distance to access certain categories of specialist medical services. 7. Prevention, promotion and protection Prevention, promotion and protection services aim to achieve optimal health and wellbeing of the Western Australian population. The service implements strategies that encourage healthy lifestyles, aim to reduce the risk and onset of disease and disability, provide facility for early detection of health issues, and monitor the incidence of disease in the population. Some areas covered by this service include communicable disease control, environmental health, disaster planning and management, child and community health, and health promotion activities. 8. Dental health Dental health services are aimed at preventing oral and dental health issues as well as facilitating access to oral health care for target populations. This service includes the: School Dental Program, which provides dental health assessment and treatment for school children Adult dental service, which ensures equity of access to financially and/or geographically disadvantaged Western Australians Specialist and general oral health services provided by the Oral Health Centre of Western Australia to financially disadvantaged Western Australians. Dental health services are provided through government funded dental clinics, mobile services and private dental practitioners participating in the metropolitan and country patient dental subsidy schemes. Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 479. Continuing care Aged and continuing care services are those services that are provided to Western Australians in need of long term assistance to maintain their health and lead independent lives. This service is delivered to the Western Australian community through programs such as: the Home and Community Care program, which provides services such as nursing care and domestic assistance the Transition Care Program, which aims to help older people's independence after a hospital stay non-government continuing care programs, which offer residential care type services for aged or disabled persons residential care and nursing home care provided by the State chronic illness support services, which provide people with a chronic condition with treatment and preventive care to enable them to remain healthy at home. 10. Contracted mental health Contracted mental health services describe inpatient care in an authorised ward and community mental health services provided by health services under agreement with the Mental Health Commission. Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 48Outcome 1: Restoration of patients' health, provision of maternity care to women and newborns and support for patients and families during terminal illness The achievement of this outcome of the health objective involves activities which: ensure that people have appropriate and timely access to acute care services when they are in need of them so that intervention occurs as early as possible. Timely and appropriate access ensures that the acute illness does not progress or the effects of injury do not progress, increasing the chance of complete recovery from the illness or injury (for example access to elective surgery) provide quality diagnostic and treatment services that ensure the maximum restoration to health after an acute illness or injury provide appropriate after-care and rehabilitation to ensure that people's physical and social functioning is restored as far as possible provide appropriate obstetric care during pregnancy and the birth episode to both mother and child provide appropriate care and support for patients and their families during terminal illness. Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 49Outcome 1: Effectiveness KPI Proportion of privately managed public patients discharged to home Rationale The main goal of health care provision is to ensure that people receive appropriate evidenced-based health care without experiencing preventable harm. Forging effective partnerships between consumers, healthcare providers and organisations is also a goal. Hospitals can better deliver safer and higher quality care, better outcomes for patients and provide a more effective and efficient health system through improvements achieved in these priority areas. Measuring the number of patients discharged home after hospital care allows for the monitoring of changes over time that can enable the identification of the priority areas for improvement. This enables targeted interventions and health promotion strategies aimed at ensuring restoration of patients' health. This indicator measures the percentage of public patients discharged to home from the privately managed Joondalup and Peel Health Campuses. Target The 2012 target was 98.9 per cent. The target was based on the best result achieved within the previous five years. Improved or maintained performance is demonstrated by a result exceeding or equal to the target. Results For the 2012 calendar year, the 'all ages' category for public patients discharged to home from privately managed hospitals was 98.6 per cent. This result was close the year target of 98.9 per cent. A result equal to or better than the target value was desirable.

Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 51Outcome 1: Effectiveness KPI Unplanned readmission rate for the same or related condition for privately managed public patients Rationale Readmission rate is considered a global performance measure, as it potentially points to deficiencies in the functioning of the overall health care system. Good intervention and appropriate treatment, together with good discharge planning, decrease the likelihood of unplanned hospital readmissions. A low unplanned readmission rate suggests that good clinical practice is in operation. These readmissions necessitate patients spending additional periods of time in hospital as well as utilising additional hospital resources. Some conditions may require numerous admissions to enable the best level of care to be given and in most of these cases hospital readmission is planned. Through measuring and monitoring this indicator, the level of potentially avoidable hospital readmissions can be assessed in order to identify key areas of improvement. This can then facilitate the development and delivery of targeted care pathways and interventions, which can aid in ensuring effective restoration to health and improve the quality of life of Western Australians. Target The 2012 target is less than 0.9 per cent. The target was based on the rolling average of the previous three years results, where the result was greater than zero. Improved or maintained performance is demonstrated by a result below or equal to the target. Results A representative sample period of September to November 2012 was chosen for the calculation of this key performance indicator. For both Joondalup and Peel Health Campus, the percentage of unplanned readmissions for the same or related condition for privately managed public patients wason target (0.9 per cent). Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 52Figure 3: Unplanned readmission rate for the same or related condition for privately managed public patients 2011 2012 Notes: Due to relatively small numbers of separations for public patients from both Joondalup and Peel Health Campus, the rates may fluctuate over time and therefore should be interpreted with caution. Data source: Hospital Morbidity Data System, Department of Health unpublished data. Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 53Outcome 1: Effectiveness KPI Survival rates for sentinel conditions of privately managed public patients Rationale Hospital survival indicators should be used as a means for screening for the identification of areas for improvement, rather than being assumed to be definitively diagnostic of poor quality and/or safety. This indicator measures a hospitals' performance in relation to restoring the health of people who have suffered a sentinel condition-specifically a stroke, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or fractured neck of femur (FNOF). For these conditions, a good recovery is more likely when there is early intervention and appropriate care on presentation to an emergency department and on admission to hospital. These three conditions have been chosen as they are particularly significant for the health care of the community and are leading causes of death and hospitalisation in Australia. This indicator is intended to signal that a problem may exist and that further detailed investigation is required. Missed signals can potentially lead to fatal outcomes that could have been avoided had the signals been identified and acted on. Through reviewing and analysing survival rates, targeted strategies can be developed that aim to increase patient survival after being admitted for a sentinel condition. Therefore, this indicator can potentially assist hospitals in monitoring changes over time to facilitate effective restoration of patients' health. Target The 2012 target for each condition: Target Stroke 85.9 % AMI 98.1% FNOF 98.7% The target was based on the best result achieved within the previous five years. If a result of 100 per cent was obtained, the next best result was adopted to address the issue of small numbers. Improved or maintained performance is demonstrated by a result exceeding or equal to the target. Results Results for 2012 were slightly below the targets set. For stroke and hip fractures, the result is also indicative of a decline since 2011. However there has been a slight increase in the percentage survival rate for people who have suffered a heart attack.

Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 55Service 1 - Public hospital admitted patients Efficiency KPI Average cost of public admitted patient treatment episodes in private hospitals Rationale Western Australia's public health system aims to provide safe, high-quality health care that ensures healthier, longer and better quality lives for all Western Australians. In order to improve, promote and protect the health of Western Australians, it is critical that the health system is sustainable by providing effective and efficient care that best uses allocated funds and resources. To ensure all Western Australia's have timely access to effective health care, the State Government has entered into collaborative agreements with private sector health providers in the State to deliver hospital services to the community. Target A target unit cost of $3,180 was set in the State Government Budget Statements published in May 2012. A result below the target was desirable. Results In 2012-13, the average cost of public admitted patient treatment episodes in private hospitals was $3,137, below the target of $3,180.

In order to improve, promote and protect the health of Western Australians, it is critical that the health system is sustainable by providing effective and efficient care that best uses allocated funds and resources. This indicator is a measure of the cost of providing care in hospital to patients by the number of people who reside in Western Australia. It accounts for specific expenses contributing to hospital services, including, improving clinical practice and medical workforce via the development and implementation of policies and models of care. Target A target unit cost of $32.06 was set in the State Government Budget Statements published in May 2012. A result below the target was desirable. Results In 2012-13, the cost per capita of supporting treatment of patients in public hospitals was $31.71, below the target of $32.06. This expenditure includes the costs associated with providing the best possible public hospital facilities and services to the Western Australian public.

Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 57Service 2 - Home-based hospital program Efficiency KPI Average cost per home-based hospital day of care and occasion of service Rationale Western Australia's public health system aims to provide safe, high-quality health care that ensures healthier, longer and better quality lives for all Western Australians. In order to improve, promote and protect the health of Western Australians, it is critical that the health system is sustainable by providing effective and efficient care that best uses allocated funds and resources. Home based hospital programs have been implemented as a means of ensuring all Western Australia's have timely access effective health care. These programs aim to provide safe and effective medical care for patients in their home that would otherwise require a hospital admission. In addition to the home based hospital programs that are delivered by the public health system, the Western Australian Government has entered into a collaborative agreement with Silver Chain to provide these programs for suitable patients. The home based hospital service may be delivered as in-home admitted acute medical care, measured by days of care, or as post-discharge or sub-acute medical intervention, delivered as occasions of service. Target Target unit costs of $270 and $110 were set in the State Government Budget Statements published in May 2012 for home based hospital day of care and occasion of service respectively. A result below the target was desirable. Results In 2012-13, the average cost per home based hospital day of care was $291, above the target of $270. The average cost per home based hospital occasion of service was $115, slightly above the target of $110.

Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 59Outcome 1: Effectiveness KPI Proportion of people with cancer accessing admitted palliative care services Rationale The World Health Organization defines palliative care as care that improves the quality of life of patients and families who face life-threatening illness, by providing pain and symptom relief, spiritual and psychosocial support from diagnosis to the end of life and bereavement. Effective palliative care requires a broad multidisciplinary approach and may be provided in hospital or at home. Hospital based palliative care services aim to improve the quality of life of patients and families through the provision of symptom management, respite care and terminal care. Cancer is a leading cause of death in Australia and accounts for about three in 10 deaths. Therefore, it is critical that effective palliative care services are available to these terminally ill cancer patients and their families. Monitoring this indicator's changes over time can facilitate the identification of the demand for palliative care services by terminally ill cancer patients in the hospital, which can enable the development of evidence-based programs and management strategies. This will ensure accessible and effective palliative care services for Western Australians. Target The 2011 target was 49.2 per cent. The target was based on the average of the previous four years. Results The proportion of people terminally ill with cancer accessing admitted palliative care services was 48.8 per cent in 2011, slightly below the target of 49.2 per cent. Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 60Figure 8: Proportion of people with cancer accessing admitted palliative care services 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Percentage of Patients Using Palliative methodology for calculating this KPI has been changed to reflect a more appropriate numerator. 1. Previous methodology used \"number of admissions for palliative care\" as the numerator, which was inclusive of all palliative care admissions. 2. The KPI title specifies \"proportion of people with cancer accessing palliative care services\", indicating patient numbers, rather than admissions, and specifically cancer patients. 3. A more appropriate numerator for this KPI is now incorporated, which reflects the KPI title - \"number of persons with cancer admitted for palliative care\". 4. Results reported are recalculated using the new numerator and KPI methodology. Previously reported results, no longer considered appropriate, are as follows: 2007 - 72.6 per cent with a target of 63 per cent. 2008 - 69.8 per cent with a target of 65.3 per cent. 2009 - 64.4 per cent with a target of 67.4 per cent. 2010 - 67.9 per cent with a target of 67.2 per cent. 5. The target for 2011 was re-determined using the recalculated data. Data source: WA Cancer Registry, Hospital Morbidity Data System. Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 61Service 3 - Palliative care Efficiency KPI Average cost per client receiving contracted palliative care services Rationale Western Australia's public health system aims to provide safe, high-quality health care that ensures healthier, longer and better quality lives for all Western Australians. In order to improve, promote and protect the health of Western Australians, it is critical that the health system is sustainable by providing effective and efficient care that best uses allocated funds and resources. Palliative care is aimed at improving the quality of life of patients and families who face life-threatening illness, by providing pain and symptom relief, spiritual and psychosocial support from diagnosis to the end of life and bereavement. In addition to palliative care services that are provided through the public health system, the Western Australian Government has entered into collaborative agreements with private sector health providers to provide palliative care services for those in need. Target A target unit cost of $6,423 was set in the State Government Budget Statements published in May 2012. A result below the target was desirable. Results The average cost per client receiving contracted palliative care services for 2012-13 was $5,560, under the target of $6,423. Figure 9: Average cost per client receiving contracted palliative care services 2008-09 2009-10 2010-1 1 was the base year for the current five year adjustment series.

Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 62Outcome 1: Effectiveness KPI Response times for patient transport services Rationale To ensure Western Australians receive the care they need, when they need it, strong partnerships have been forged within the health care community through collaboration between St John Ambulance Australia - Western Australia, the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the Western Australian Department of Health. This collaboration ensures that patients have access to an effective ambulance and Royal Flying Doctor Service to ensure the best possible health outcomes for patients requiring urgent medical treatment through rapid response. Response times for patient transport services have a direct impact on the speed with which a patient receives appropriate medical care and provide a good indication of the efficiency and effectiveness of patient transport services. It is believed that adverse effects on patients and the community are reduced if response times are reduced. This indicator measures the response of patient transport services provided within the metropolitan and rural areas of Western Australia, to patients with the highest need (priority 1) of urgent medical treatment. Through surveillance of this measure over time, the effectiveness and efficiency of patient transport services can be determined. This facilitates further development of targeted strategies and improvements to operational management practices, aimed at ensuring optimal restoration to health for patients in need of urgent medical care. Target The 2012-13 target was: St John Ambulance - WA Royal Flying Doctor Service Target Metropolitan area: Attend to 90 per cent of priority 1 calls within 15 minutes.80 per cent of inter-hospital transfers (excluding regional resource centres) meeting the Target Contract Patient Response Time.

Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 Outcome 2 Enhanced health and wellbeing of Western Australians through health promotion, illness and injury prevention and appropriate continuing care The achievement of this health objective involves activities which: 1. Increase the likelihood of optimal health and wellbeing by: providing programs which support the optimal physical, social and emotional development of infants and children encouraging healthy lifestyles (e.g. diet and exercise). 2. Reduce the likelihood of onset of disease or injury by: immunisation program safety programs encouraging healthy lifestyles (e.g. diet and exercise). 3. Reduce the risk of long-term disability or premature death from injury or illness through prevention, early identification and intervention, such as: programs for early detection of developmental issues in children and appropriate referral for intervention early identification and intervention of disease and disabling conditions (breast and cervical cancer screening, screening of newborns) with appropriate referrals programs which support self-management by people with diagnosed conditions and disease (diabetic education) monitoring the incidence of disease in the population to determine the effectiveness of primary health measures. 4. Provide continuing care services and programs that improve and enhance the wellbeing and the environment for people with chronic illness or disability. This enables people with chronic illness or disability to maintain as much independence in their everyday life as their illness permits. This supporting people in their homes for as long as possible and providing extra care when long term residential care is required. Services: ensure that people experience the minimum of pain and discomfort from their chronic illness or disability maintain the optimal level of physical and social functioning prevent or slow down the progression of the illness or disability enable people to live, as long as possible, in the place of their choice supported by, for example, home care services or home delivery of meals support families and carers in their roles provide access to recreation, education and employment opportunities. Key Performance Indicators 66Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Loss of life from premature death due to identifiable causes of preventable disease or injury Rationale Loss of life from preventable disease or injury refers to premature deaths from conditions considered to be potentially avoidable through the application of existing public health or medical interventions. These are unnecessary, untimely deaths. Measuring potential years of life lost and the cause of these premature deaths is one of the most important means of monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness, quality and productivity of health systems. The potential years of life lost from premature death are measured for specified conditions, which include falls, ischaemic heart disease, melanoma and lung cancer. These conditions contribute significantly to the burden of disease and injury within the community and are considered National Health Priority Areas. The data obtained from this indicator can assist health system managers to best determine targeted promotion and prevention initiatives, such as the WA Health Promotion Strategic Framework 2012-2016 , that are required in order to reduce the loss of life from these preventable conditions by improving the effectiveness and quality of health care delivery. Target The 2011 target was: Preventable disease Target (in years) Falls 0.1 Ischaemic Heart Disease 2.7 Melanoma 0.5 Lung cancer 1.9 Results In 2011, the potential number of years of life lost from premature death caused by lung cancer was unchanged from 2010 and below the target for 2011. For ischaemic heart disease, there was an improvement from the previous year, with the 2011 result meeting the target. For falls and melanoma, the results were slightly higher than previous years and potential years of lost life were marginally higher than the targets set for these conditions.

Minor methodological improvements and updates to death data mean that figures are not directly comparable with previous reports. 6. Although not all cases of these conditions will be avoidable, it is very difficult to assess what proportion was avoidable without extensive meta-analysis of the literature. The conditions identified above are those for which the Department of Health has screening or health promotion programs; premature deaths from these should be largely preventable. Although the Department of Health has programs specifically targeted at reducing the impact of these diseases and injuries, not all of the reduction in PYLL can be attributed to these programs, as other influences outside of the Department's jurisdiction may be responsible for part of it. 7. The unit record file containing death data for 2008 and above has only recently been made available by the Australian Bureau Statistics to the Department of Health. Aggregated data was extracted by the Australian Bureau Statistics for this analysis in the previous year. As unit record file data is now available, death data for 2001 and above have been updated from previous years. As such this data is not comparable to the previous year as Australian Bureau Statistics confidentiality policy requires all cells with counts less than five to be randomised to a value between one and four to protect privacy. Consequently, the counts for some cells provided by the Australian Bureau Statistics previously will differ from those extracted from the death data unit record file made available to the Department of Health. Furthermore, due to the lag time in death registrations, additional deaths may be included in this analysis. The difference in cell counts will result in slightly different PYLL calculations.

Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 69Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Percentage of fully immunised children Rationale In accordance with the National Partnership Agreement on Essential Vaccines, WA Health aims to minimise the incidence of major vaccine preventable diseases in Australia. Immunisation is a simple, safe and effective way of protecting people against harmful diseases before they come into contact with them in the community. Immunisation not only protects individuals, but also others in the community, by reducing the spread of disease. Without access to immunisation, the consequences of any illness or disability are likely to be more disabling and more likely to contribute to a premature death. This indicator measures the percentage of fully immunised children that have received age appropriate immunisations in order to facilitate the effectiveness of health promotion strategies that aim to reduce the overall incidence of potentially serious disease. Target The agreed target in the National Childhood Immunisation program is at least 90 per cent of children fully immunised at 12-months, two-years and five-years-of-age. Results In 2012, at a State level, all age categories reached or passed the target, with the exception of Aboriginal babies at 12-months-of-age and non- Aboriginal children at five years of age. For the metropolitan area, only non-Aboriginal babies at 12-months-of-age reached or passed the target. In regional Western Australia, all age categories reached the target except Aboriginal babies at 12-months-of-age.

Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 71Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Rate of hospitalisations for selected potentially preventable diseases Rationale In accordance with the National Partnership Agreement on Essential Vaccines, WA Health aims to minimise the incidence of major vaccine preventable diseases in Australia. Immunisation is a simple, safe and effective way of protecting people against preventable disease before they come into contact with them in the community. Immunisation not only protects individuals, but also others in the community, by reducing the spread of disease and likelihood of hospitalisation. The hospitalisations for vaccine preventable diseases amongst children are measured for specified infectious conditions that include measles, mumps, pertussis, hepatitis B and tetanus, which form part of the National Immunisation Program and can pose a significant burden on health care in Australia. The surveillance of hospitalisations for vaccine preventable conditions amongst children can support the further development and delivery of targeted health promotion initiatives and prevention strategies, such as the Western Australian Immunisation Strategy 2013-15, that aim to reduce the impact of these conditions on individuals and the community. This ensures enhanced health and well-being of Western Australians, while supporting the sustainability of the public health system. Targets The target set for 2012-13 was zero reported cases across all categories. Results In 2012, there were no hospitalisations for measles or hepatitis B across Western Australia. Hospitalisation for mumps in non-Aboriginal children was at a rate of 0.24 per 100,000. Hospitalisation for whooping cough was above the target of none or few, with State hospitalisation rates at 59.63 for Aboriginal children and 14.76 for non-Aboriginal children.

In order to improve, promote and protect the health of Western Australians, it is critical that the health system is sustainable by providing effective and efficient care that best uses allocated funds and resources. The delivery of effective targeted preventative interventions, health promotion and health protection activities aims at reducing disease, disability and injury within the community, fostering the ongoing health and well-being of Western Australians. Target A target unit cost of $51.63 was set in the State Government Budget Statements published in May 2012. A result below the target was desirable. Results In 2012-13, the cost per capita of providing preventative interventions, health promotion and health protection activities was $54.81, above the target of $51.63.

Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 74Outcome 2: Effectiveness KPI Eligible patients on the Oral Health Centre of Western Australia waiting list who received treatment during the year Rationale Oral health, including dental health, is fundamental to overall health, wellbeing and quality of life with poor oral health likely to exist when general health is poor and vice versa. This makes access to timely oral treatment services critical in reducing the burden of oral disease on individuals and communities, as it can enable early detection and diagnosis with the use of preventative interventions rather than extensive restorative or emergency treatments. To facilitate the equity of access to dental healthcare for all Western Australians, specialised oral treatment services are provided through State Government subsidised dental care for Health Care card holders and general dental care to eligible patients within their local catchment area by the Oral Health Centre of Western Australia. Costly treatment and high demand on public dental health services emphasises the need for a focus on prevention and health promotion. This indicator measures the access and timeliness to specialised oral treatment services by monitoring the number of all eligible patients on the oral waiting list who have received treatment during the year. Through monitoring specialised oral treatment services received by eligible patients, the areas of greatest need can be identified, which can aid in facilitating the development of more effective targeted programs to ensure improved oral care for Western Australians. Target The 2012-13 targets were: Dental speciality Number General Periodontics 604 Other 790 A result above the target was desirable. Results In 2012-13, the number of eligible patients receiving treatment through the Oral Health Centre of Western Australia exceeded the targets, except for patients waiting for oral surgery. This is due to a shortage of oral surgeons to meet the demand for oral surgery services. Key Performance IndicatorsDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 75Overall, the number of services provided by Oral Health Centre of Western Australia to eligible people increased from 9604 in 2011-12 to 9994 in 2012-13, representing a four per cent increase. These increases were seen in general practice, orthodontics, paedodontics and periodontics. The increase in general dentistry can be attributed to new services in the Bunbury region, and an increase in the number of post-graduate students partaking in this service delivery.

The program aims to reduce the use of residential and acute care, reduce the risk of premature or inappropriate long-term residential care, improve functioning and support independence in the community, support carers and enhance the quality of life for these Western Australians in need. The reach and effectiveness of the Home and Community Care Program can be determined through monitoring the number of people in the target population who have received home and community care services. This, in turn, can support the development of targeted strategies that aim to ensure that the people with the greatest need have access to the services they require and are provided with the care they need in the most appropriate setting - ensuring the well-being and quality of life for Western Australians in need. Target For 2012-13, the target was 327 per 1,000 home and community care target population. Results In 2012-13, the rate per 1,000 target population receiving home and community care services was 338, above the target rate of 327.

The program aims to reduce the use of residential and acute care, reduce the risk of premature or inappropriate long-term residential care, improve functioning and support independence in the community, support carers and enhance the quality of life for these Western Australians in need. To drive the continuous improvement of the Home and Community Care Program, the Home and Community Care Client Quality of Life Survey has been developed. This survey obtains feedback from clients about the effectiveness of the program in supporting them to remain living independently in the community. Through measuring client satisfaction on the Home and Community Care Program's success of supporting clients to be independent and in improving their quality of life, areas of improvement can be identified. This enables improvements in service planning and the development of targeted strategies and interventions that focus on improving the program's effectiveness and ensuring the provision of the most appropriate care to those in need. This enhances the well-being and quality of life for Western Australians in need. Target The target for 2012-13 was: 85 per cent of home and community care clients believe home and community care helps them to be independent 85 per cent of home and community care clients believe home and community care improves the quality of life. Results The 2012-13 Home and Community Care Quality of Life Survey was conducted in April, 2013. This survey used the 2012-13 dataset of population of 49,986 cases from the WA home and community care minimum data set. Of this population, 1288 clients were contacted and 1070 were surveyed, representing 83.1 per cent participation. Results demonstrated that 88 per cent of home and community care clients believed that the Home and Community Care Program helped them to be independent, and 92.5 per cent believed that it improved their quality of life. These results were above the target of 85 per cent for both categories.

This program is tailored to meet the needs of the individual and aims to facilitate a continuum of care for older people in a non-hospital environment while giving them more time and support to make a decision on their longer term care arrangements. The effectiveness of a Transition Care program can be assessed by measuring functional ability improvements in clients utilising the Transition Care program. Monitoring the success of this indicator can enable improvements in service planning and the development of targeted strategies and interventions that focus on improving the program's effectiveness, and ensuring the provision of the most appropriate care to those in need. This enhances the health and wellbeing of elderly Western Australians. Target The 2012-13 target for the percentage of clients maintaining or improving functional ability was 65 per cent.

In order to improve, promote and protect the health of Western Australians, it is critical that the health system is sustainable by providing effective and efficient care that best uses allocated funds and resources. The goal of non-acute care is the prevention of deterioration in the functional and current health status of patients, such as frail older people or younger people with a disability. Non-acute care is usually provided in a hospital while patients are awaiting placement into residential care, waiting for the services they will need at home to be organised or vital modifications to be made to their homes or when their carer needs a break. In addition to the non-acute admitted continuing care services that are delivered by the public health system, the Western Australian Government has entered into collaborative agreements with Mercy Hospital and Brightwater Care Group to provide continuing care for non-acute patients. Target A target unit cost of $625 was set in the State Government Budget Statements published in May 2012. A result below the target was desirable.

In order to improve, promote and protect the health of Western Australians, it is critical that the health system is sustainable by providing effective and efficient care that best uses allocated funds and resources. Chronic conditions pose a significant burden on health care in Western Australia. Most chronic conditions do not resolve spontaneously, and are generally not cured - requiring ongoing care and support. As such, the Government has identified several chronic conditions e.g. diabetes, which requires special health services to improve quality of life. In addition to chronic diseases, ongoing care and support is also required for those who have permanent disabilities, to enhance their health and well-being. This is provided through residential, community or respite care through organisations that have collaborative agreements with the Western Australian Government. Target A target unit cost of $46.88 was set in the State Government Budget Statements published in May 2012. A result below the target was desirable. Results In 2012-13 the average cost to support patients who suffer specific chronic illness and other clients who require continuing care was $47.45, slightly higher than the target of $46.88.

Research has shown that satisfaction is related to better health outcomes1,2. Every year since 1997, the Patient Evaluation of Health Services (PEHS) surveys thousands of patients and asks about their experiences in the health system. Since 2004-05, surveys have been conducted by telephone survey with the exception of some special patient groups. This has contributed to response rates of more than 85 per cent and participation rates of more than 90 per cent. These high response rates lend more weight to the results which can be assumed to be representative, reliable and valid. Specifically customised surveys are used to evaluate satisfaction across different patient groups. In 2012-13, the following patient groups were assessed: Admitted patients, 0-34 nights: adult 16-74 years child 0-15 years older adult 75+ years Outpatients: adult 16-74 years child 0-15 years Emergency department patients: adult 16-74 years child 0-15 year. This year, 7,440 admitted patients, 1,397 outpatients and 1,586 emergency department patients were interviewed about their experience. Patients are firstly asked to rank aspects of health care from most to least important. Secondly patients are asked specific questions about how satisfied they were with their hospital stay. Aspects of health care that patients deem important A review of the relevant literature and a series of focus groups has found that patient satisfaction is linked to seven stable aspects of health care that are related to patient satisfaction. However, the relative importance that patients place on each aspect of health care may change in response to circumstances. Each year, respondents are asked to rank the seven aspects from most important to least important in order to determine the relative importance they place on each aspects of care.

The patient groups differed in the importance they placed on getting into hospital and information and communication. Satisfaction with aspects of health care A review of the literature and a series of focus groups determined that there were seven stable aspects of health care that are related to patient satisfaction. However, the relative importance that patients attribute to each aspect of health care may change in response to circumstances. Each year, respondents are asked to rank the seven aspects from most important to least important in order to determine the relative importance of the aspects of care. The seven scales correspond with the seven important aspects of health care. An overall indicator of satisfaction is calculated from the seven scale scores, weighted by the degree of importance as ranked by the respondents. Also presented is the outcome score (out of 100). This is a measure of how satisfied people are with the outcome of their visit to the hospital. All tables present the results as scores out of 100.

As has been found in previous years, hospital size is inversely related to satisfaction across some scales. This means that patients tend to be more satisfied in the smaller hospitals. The Outcome Scale score is higher than the Overall indicator of satisfaction for all groups indicating that although patients are satisfied with their experience while in hospital they are more satisfied with the outcome of their hospital visit regardless of the hospital visited. Comparison over time Results from this year's survey (collected from July 2012 to June 2013) have been calculated and compared with the results from 2011-12 (collected from July 2011 to June 2012) and 2010-11 (collected from July 2010 to June 2011). These results are presented in Table 16.

This question still contributes to the Involvement Scale score for previous years. The score for Involvement Scale was significantly higher in 2012-13 when compared to 2011-12 and 2010-11. There were no other significant differences. Admitted patients, 0-34 nights, 75+ years Comparison over time Results from this year's survey (collected from July 2012 to June 2013) have been calculated and compared with the results from 2008 (collected from February to June 2008).

When the 2012-13 older adult admitted scale scores were compared to the 2008 scale scores, there were no significant differences. Outpatients Comparison over time Patients who attended appointments at metropolitan outpatient departments (excluding Peel Health Campus and Kalamunda Hospital) were surveyed about their experiences. Results from this year's survey (collected from July 2012 to June 2013) have been calculated and compared with the results from 2010-11 and 2007 (collected from July 2010 to June 2011 and February to June 2007 respectively).

When the 2012-13 scales scores were compared to the 2011-12 and 2009-10 scales for emergency department patients, there were no significant differences. Relationship between the satisfaction and the importance of aspects of health care Admitted patients (0-74 years), 0-34 nights had satisfaction scores that exceeded the average score of 80 out of 100 for three of the seven scale scores. This indicates a high level of satisfaction with these areas of health care. The three best performing scales were also ranked as the three most important aspects of health care by the patients. Older adult admitted patients (75+ years), 0-34 nights had high levels of satisfaction with scores exceeding 80 out of 100 for four out of the seven scales. The top two ranking satisfaction scales were ranked in the top three most important aspects of health care by older adult admitted patients. Patient Evaluation of Health ServicesDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 99Outpatients had satisfaction scores that exceeded the average score of 80 out of 100 for two of the seven scale scores. These two satisfaction scales were ranked in the top three most important aspects of health care. Emergency department patients also had a high level of satisfaction, with scores exceeding 80 out of 100, for three of the seven scales. These three health aspects were ranked in the top four most important health aspects for this patient group.

WA Health's Code of Conduct identifies the values that are held as fundamental in our work and describes how these values translate into action. Integrity is one of the six listed values. The Code of Conduct articulates clearly the standards of conduct and integrity that are expected in WA Health. It reflects the Western Australian Public Sector Code of Ethics. To ensure all employees are familiar with the Code of Conduct, education strategies are implemented by the Corporate Governance Directorate in conjunction with Health Services. Education strategies include: Training in accountable and ethical decision making - focusing on the six modules contained within the Public Sector Commission training. During 2012-13, 6280 employees undertook online learning with 526 employees completing this training and the remainder partially completing. Furthermore, 1,548 employees attended face-to-face training Code of Ethics and Code of Conduct training \u2014 communicated through the intranet and induction sessions, both online and face-to-face. When undertaking selection processes, managers and staff are required to comply with the Public Sector Standards in Human Resource Management. A process of internal checking is in place to ensure that compliance with the standards has occurred before the final selection is approved. Avenues and procedures available to employees to report wrongdoing, including by public interest disclosure, are publicised throughout WA Health. Victimisation of those reporting wrongdoing will not be tolerated and statements are made to support this. Training in public interest disclosure is conducted in-house. In 2012-13 four public interest disclosures under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2003 were made, one was withdrawn and three were found to be appropriate. Employee profile Government agencies are required to report a summary of the number of employees, by category, in comparison with the preceding financial year.

Under the business rules of the National Health Reform Agreement, where an eligible person receives public hospital services as a public patient in a public hospital or a publicly contracted bed in a private hospital, they will be treated 'free of charge'. States can charge public patients requiring nursing care and accommodation as an end in itself after the 35th day of stay in hospital, provided they no longer need hospital-level treatment. If they are deemed to be a Nursing Home Type Patient, they will be charged with the total daily amount being no more than 87.5 per cent of the current daily rate of the single aged pension and the maximum daily rate of rental assistance. Private patients, compensable patients and ineligible persons may be charged an amount for public hospital services as determined by the State of Western Australia. The setting of compensable and ineligible hospital accommodation fees is set close to, or at full cost recovery. The Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing regulates the minimum benefit payable by private health funds to privately insured patients for private shared ward accommodation and also the Nursing Home Type Patient - 'patient contribution'. The State sets these fees at a level that equates to the Commonwealth minimum benefit. The pricing of pharmaceutical items is set at the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme statutory co-payments, as regulated by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing on 1 January each year. Note that pharmaceuticals supplied to admitted private patients, will be provided 'free of charge'. The charging of eligible war service veterans is determined under a separate Australian- State agreement with the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Under this agreement the Department of Health does not charge medical treatment to eligible war service veteran patients. Instead, medical charges are fully recouped from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In summary, the majority of hospital fees and charges for public hospitals is set out in the Hospitals (Services Charges) Regulations 1984 (\"Hospitals Regulations\") and the Hospitals (Services Charges for Compensable Patients) Determination 2005. These hospital fees are reviewed annually and increased each financial year. There are other categories of fees specified under the Hospitals Regulations through Determinations, which include the supply of Surgically Implanted Prostheses, Magnetic Resonance Imaging Services and Pathology Services. The pricing for these hospital services is determined according to their cost of service. The Dental Health Service charges eligible patients for dental treatment based on the Department of Veterans' Affairs Local Dental Officers fee schedule, with eligible patients charged either of the following co-payment rates: 50 per cent of the treatment fee if the patient is the holder of a current Health Care card or Pensioner Concession card Disclosure and ComplianceDepartment of Health | Annual Report 2012-13 114 25 per cent of the treatment fee if the patient is the current holder of one of the above cards and in receipt of a near full pension or an allowance from Centrelink or the Department of Veterans Affairs. Recordkeeping In 2012-13 the Department of Health continues to progress its compliance with the State Records Act 2000 through the Department of Health Recordkeeping Plan. The Department is currently updating its Recordkeeping Plan and associated Recordkeeping policies as a consequence of the 2011-12 Recordkeeping Plan review. Work has also commenced on establishing recordkeeping plans within the WA Country Health Service, Child and Adolescent Health Service, North Metropolitan Health Service and South Metropolitan Health Service. All Departmental staff are required to comply with both the Department of Health Recordkeeping Plan and associated policies. Recordkeeping training for staff is included in a range of educational initiatives which include: Online recordkeeping awareness training Online induction programs Face-to-face induction training Records intranet web sites Recordkeeping Module of Accountability and Ethical Decision Making Face-to-face ethical decision-making courses Online records and TRIM training Face-to-face records management and HP-TRIM training. The primary means for raising awareness of recordkeeping is the online recordkeeping awareness training. In total 30,432 staff have been enrolled in this training course, with 20,758 staff enrolled during 2012-13. High percentages of staff from Health Services continue to undertake this training with a total of 28,011 Metropolitan Health Service and WA Country Health Service staff enrolled, of whom 19,862 were enrolled during 2012-13. The efficiency and effectiveness of the recordkeeping training program is reviewed on a regular basis via feedback and assessments of training by attendees. These training programs have proved popular, with approximately 83 per cent of staff describing the course as informative, essential or stimulating and 88 per cent agreeing that their knowledge had improved as a consequence of the training.
