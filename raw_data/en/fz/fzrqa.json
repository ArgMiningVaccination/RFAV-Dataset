This restriction enables the body to get to the back log of toxins it has in line for removal. - REDUCE INFLAMMATION The program includes tips for reducing inflammation in your body. When we reduce inflammation we not only feel better, it allows our organs especially the organs involved in detoxification such as the liver and bowel to work more effectively. - BLOOD SUGAR REGULATION The program includes tips for blood sugar regulation. May of us (even those with healthy diets) are stuck in a sugar cycle. We are eating too many carbs too frequently and it is making our bodies flat and tired.

A detox program has to be carefully designed to meet the health needs of each person and their level of health. Before starting your program, you must advise your practitioner if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, taking medications, have a kidney or liver disorder, issues with blood sugar, heart disease or any other health issues. Do not detox while you are sick or constipated - consult your practitioners to address these issues prior to detox.
