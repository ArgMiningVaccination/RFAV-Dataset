Folk medicine consists of traditional healing concepts and methods used in past cultures by people deemed to have the healing power. Often based on religious beliefs, these practices are used to cure diseases and promote emotional and physical well being. The practice of folk medicine is usually handed down from generation to generation by word of mouth. In general, this system was used because traditional medicine failed to support blacks and poor whites. SPANISH MOSS (Also referred to as Crape-moss and Old man's beard) VITAMIN E OIL CAYENNE PEPPER ALOE VERA BAKING SODA LEECHES BLACK DOG RATTLESNAKE SKIN BUZZARD FEATHERS SILVER DIME GARLIC EELSKIN WOODLICE Drinking To break your husband of drinking, skin a live eel, put the skin in some liquor and give it to him. He will never drink again. Chicken-pox Go into the chicken house and let the chickens fly over you, or simply push the patient backward into the henhouse. Chills and Fever Cut a notch in a piece of wood for every chill you have had, blow on it, and throw it into a running stream where you never expect to pass again. Go home without looking back, and you will have no more chills. Typhoid Typhoid fever may be cured by taking a bath in steeped peach leaves, while a young black chicken is split open and applied bloody and hot to the chest. Backache Let a child who has never seen his father, or is a seventh daughter, walk across your back. Toothache Pick an aching tooth with a splinter (from the north side of a pine tree that has been struck by lightning) and throw the sliver into running water. Hiccoughs May be cured by holding your breath and taking nine swallows of water. Nine grains of pepper for nine mornings or nine shots held in the mouth are equally effective. Sore Throat Tie the sock that you have worn all day around your throat with the sole of the sock turned towards your skin. Some believe that salt or warm ashes should be put into the stocking and some insist upon using a dark stocking. Earache Take the head off a wood beetle and drop the one drop of blood that comes out into the aching ear. For similar results, get some hair from a young girl and place it in your ear. "}
