It is more important now than ever to do what we can to keep our families healthy. What are you doing daily to boost your immunity? How Water Can Help your Health First off, how much water are you drinking a day? Like most of us, there is a good chance you are not drinking enough. Water can do so much for our bodies. Waterworks by carrying oxygen to your body's cells, which helps you function in the best way! It is also very important in removing the unwanted toxins in your body. It is crucial to your day that you are drinking enough to get rid of anything that shouldn't be in your body. These unwanted toxins and chemicals can have a serious effect on your immune system. But we don't stop at simply drinking the water. One other major aspect of water is how you are using it externally. Washing your hands, your body, your hair; is all-important to staying healthy. When you have high-quality water in your home, it can help your body inside and outside. You are literally washing away all the germs and bacteria from your body, and you need to do so often throughout the day. Do not run to your hand sanitizer every time if you have high-quality water and anti-bacterial soap handy. Dehydration Can Affect your Health We all know that dehydration has a negative impact on your body, but what exactly does it do? To start, you should know that our bodies are 70% water. That means if we are not doing our part to keep that 70% up (and with high-quality water), you are hurting our immune systems. Dehydration is when your body is exerting more fluids than it is taking in. It is very common yet can be life-threatening if it is at a dangerous level. You may experience dry mouth, dizziness, nausea, and other serious symptoms. If you are not drinking enough and become dehydrated, it can also elevate other symptoms. To maintain a healthy immune system, it is very important that you stay hydrated all day long. Be sure to carry around your water bottle and do your best always to have water available to you throughout your day.
