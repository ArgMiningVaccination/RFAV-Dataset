FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Why is it important to enhance the smell and taste of supplements? The sense of smell is the most powerful sense in driving product liking, purchase decisions and brand loyalty. That's because smell is processed in the Limbic mode of the brain where preference, memory and impulses are processed. Since approximately 80% of the taste experience is from the sense of smell, ScentCerts make supplements not only smell better but taste better. What is the difference between TABS, HEARTS and PAKS? TABS and HEARTS are injected molded with encapsulated flavors, while PAKS are flavor encapsulated polymer beads in a Tyvek pouch and are available cut or on spools for automatic insertion. What are ScentCerts made of? ScentCerts are made with FDA compliant and food grade all-natural flavors that are infused into FDA compliant and food grade copolymers. Why are ScentCerts so effective at eliminating malodors? The malodors often experienced with supplements is a result of many of their active ingredients. As products age, they oxidize causing malodors to become more aggressive over time. After many years of R&D on mitigating dietary supplement malodors, ScentCerts were designed with specific flavor formulations and polymer science to combat the most aggressive malodors such as fish oil, valerian and vitamin B. ScentCerts continue to release pleasant aromas into the container throughout product shelf life. Will ScentCerts interact with the ingredients in supplements? No. The All-Natural flavors in ScentCerts are encapsulated in the polymer structure and will not negatively impact their efficacy or integrity. How do ScentCerts work? ScentCerts are made with all-natural aromatic flavors encapsulated in an FDA compliant food-grade polymer which slowly release brand enhancing aromas into the headspace of the bottle and its contents. Consumers are met with enticing aromas during opening and use. Depending on the product, ScentCerts can also positively impact the taste experience and burp-back. Are the flavors all natural, kosher, halal, and vegan? Yes. ScentCerts are made with All-Natural, FDA and Organic Compliant, Non-GMO, Vegan, Kosher and Halal certified flavors. What ScentCerts flavor will work best with my product? ScentSational offers complimentary evaluation and testing of your products. Send us 6-12 bottles and we will test, evaluate and recommend which ScentCerts will best enhance the aroma and taste of your product. Are ScentCerts FDA Compliant? Yes. ScentCerts are made with FDA compliant and food grade all-natural flavors that are infused into FDA compliant and food grade copolymers. Do ScentCerts absorb moisture? No. ScentCerts are not desiccants. Since there was no effective product to mitigate malodors until now, many products use desiccants to attempt to absorb malodors when the product doesn't require one to absorb moisture, and as a result, the desiccant may be able to be eliminated once the ScentCerts are added. Can ScentCerts be used with desiccants? Yes. Will ScentCerts effect the efficacy of your products? No. ScentCerts are made with a proprietary blend of flavors and polymers which are designed for stability. The ingredients in ScentCerts will not come out and mix with the ingredients in the product or negatively impact efficacy. Do we need to change our packaging label? ScentCerts should not impact product labeling since there are no additional ingredients added to your product. However, we recommend you check with your regulatory department to confirm your specific case. Can ScentCerts be auto inserted? Yes, depending on your equipment. TABS and HEARTS can often be inserted with a desiccant canister auto inserter. PAKS are specifically designed to fit standard desiccant autofill machines and are available cut or on spools for auto insertion. How long is shelf life? ScentCerts will release the same or similar aroma profile and intensity as manufactured, for a period of at least five (5) years from the date of manufacturer, provided they remain sealed in original packaging and in a temperature-controlled environment not to exceed 95\u00b0F. Once placed in a dietary supplement package, term of efficacy will vary based on external factors such as packaging, active ingredients and storage. Are ScentCerts safe to eat? ScentCerts are not intended for ingestion, but accidentally consuming one should not cause any harm. Although they are made with food grade flavors, they are in a polymer base which is not digestible. ScentCerts are designed to not block the air passage of adults however, they are not intended for use by children as they could cause a choking hazard. Can ScentCerts reduce burp-back? Many of our customers have reported that they get fewer negative reviews related to burp-back since adding ScentCerts to their product. Are ScentCerts available in custom flavors? Yes, ScentSational can create a Signature Scent for your brand. Only available to large volume customers. Customization fees apply. What are the MOQ's? 5,000 per flavor for TABS AND HEARTS. MOQ's vary for PAKS based upon size and type so check your sales representative for details. Are ScentCerts produced at cGMP Facilities? ScentCerts TABS & HEARTS are manufactured at ISO Certified injection molding plants. ISO is the packing material manufacturing equivalent of cGMP. ScentCerts PAKS are produced at facilities that practice GMP and ISO. How do ScentCerts extend product shelf life? ScentCerts extend shelf life of products which are pulled early due to organoleptic issues making them smell and taste bad after a certain point on the shelf. ScentCerts deliver long lasting stable aromas which keep the product smelling and tasting great, even after a long period of time on the shelf. Do ScentCerts improve customer compliance? Yes. Many customers stop using products due to bad smell and taste. ScentCerts improve the consumer experience which results in improved compliance. What kind of supplements do ScentCerts work on? ScentCerts can make all capsules, soft-gels, tablets and gummies smell and taste great. Why are ScentCerts better than any other product on the market? - Activated Charcoal -Absorbs only large molecule malodors. Does not enhance aroma and taste - Silica Gel Desiccants - Absorb moisture and moist odors. Does not enhance aroma and taste - Gelatin Capsules -Intended to limit release of malodors but are often non effective. Do not enhance aroma and taste. - Flavor Coatings & Ingredients - Requires secondary process; Flavors prone to oxidation; Does not deliver comparable aroma and taste - Scented Canisters - Due to being limited by use of existing materials and size, canisters are not as effective as ScentCerts which can deliver more than 10x Brand Enhancing Aroma (depending on pack size). - Scented Desiccants - Are primarily made to absorb moisture and can only deliver a fraction of aroma compared to ScentCerts.
