What is the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of i mmune tolerance induction (ITI) for patients with haemophilia A who have developed inhibitors of factor VIII ? 2. What is the evidence for the cost -effectiveness of ITI for patients with haemophilia A who have developed inhibitors of factor VIII ? SUMMARY: Background Haemophilia A is the most common severe form of inherited bleed ing disorder and is due to a deficiency of factor VIII (FVIII). Haemophilia A has an estimated incidence rate of 1 per 5,000 live male births. FVIII activities below 1% of normal are classified as severe, 1 to 5% as moderate and 5 to 25% as mild disease. The current treatment for haemophilia is replacement therapy, where the missing clotting factor is injected into the blood. The most serious complication in the treatment of haemophilia A is the development of antibodies against FVIII (inhibitors), causing therapy resistance and increased risk of bleeding. Up to 30% of patients with severe haemophilia A develop antibodies to factor VIII. A proportion of these antibodies disappear; antibodies cleared within 6 months are known as 'transient' while those lasti ng longer are called 'persistent' and are likely to continue throughout the patient's life. The approaches commonly used to treat patients with inhibitors are administration of bypassing agentsa when a bleed occurs (on -demand), administration of bypassing agents prophylactically to prevent bleeds from occurring and initiation of immune tolerance induction (ITI) with FVIII concentrate to eradicate the inhibitor followed by long -term maintenance with a lower dose FVIII prophylaxis regimen to prevent a bleed a nd to sustain the inhibitor -free status. ITI is currently the only proven method for eradication of inhibitors but there is no consensus regarding the specifics of ITI treatment. Clinical Effectiveness We identified two systematic reviews assessing the effects of immune tolerance induction (ITI) for treating inhibitors in people with congenital haemophilia A . We also identified one prospective observational study and one retrospective study published subsequent to the systematic review ; both were uncontr olled. a Bypassing agents are agents that are able to bypass the factor VIII -dependent step in the clotting cascade and prom ote haemostasis by enhancing thrombin generation. FOR PUBLIC CONSULATION ONLY 2 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT 23-Oct-15 The first systematic review only included uncontrolled trials. The authors state that most of the studies r eported 70 to 80 percent success, (complete or partial)b but with no direct comparators it is difficult to draw any conclusions . The second review , from the Cochrane Collaboration, included one randomised controlled trial (RCT). The RCT randomised 115 paediatric participants with severe haemophilia A receiving a first attempt at ITI to either low dose (50 IU/kg of factor VIII concentrate three times per week) or a high dose (200 IU/kg of factor VIII daily). The trial did not show any statistically significant difference in the success of ITI between treatment arms . However , the trial was underpowered and did not exclude a material difference in outcome between the treatments. The low -dose arm had significantly more bleeding than the high -dose arm but again the confidence intervals were very wide. Cost Effectiveness We found three economic evaluations of ITI for patients with haemophilia A w ho have developed inhibitors of factor VIII. All the studies suggest that ITI is cost -effective compared to prophylaxis and o n-demand treatment with bypassing agents. However the analyses were based mostly on low quality clinical evidence. Safety Centra l venous access device ( CVAD ) infection was the most common complication observed in children with severe haemophilia A and i nhibitors treated with ITI in the randomised trial . A total of 124 CVAD infections were reported in 41 of 99 (41%) subjects with an overall infection rate of 0.94 per 1000 CVAD -days . A similar number of infections were observed in the two treatment arms. Infections occurred more frequently in the presence of external catheters than with fully implanted catheters. ITI outcome was unaff ected by CVAD infections. Other adverse events reported include haemarthrosis, febrile convulsion, gingivitis and allergic reaction to FVIII. 1 Context 1.1 Introduction Haemophilia A is the most common severe form of inherited bleeding disorder , and is due to a deficiency of a clotting factor protein, factor VIII (FVIII).1 Individuals with severe haemophilia A are typically diagnosed at an early age (usually in infancy) and have <1% of normal FVIII coagulant activity. FVIII activities between 1 to 5% are class ed as moderate and 5 to 25% mild. 2 The current treatment for haemophilia A is replacement therapy with FVIII. The most serious complication of treatment for those with severe haemophilia A is the development of FVI II antibody inhibitors.2, 3 A proportion of these antibodies disappear; antibodies cleared within six months are known as 'transient' while those lasting longer are called 'persistent' and are likely to continue throughout b Complete success is defined as having undetectable inhibitor titre [<0.6 Bethesda Units (BU)] at 33 FVIII reco very 66% and half -life 7 h; partial success is defined as having a reduction in inhibitor titre to <5 BU per mL <66% and/or FVIII half -life <6 h associated with clinical response to FVIII therapy not followed by a treatment -limiting anamnestic rise in inhibitors to >5 BU per mL. FOR PUBLIC CONSULATION ONLY 3 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT 23-Oct-15 the patient's life although spontaneous clearance of inhibitors after six months has also been reported. 4 Antibody inhibitors to FVIII are associated with increased mortality and significant morbidity, including a higher rate of bleeding complications, increased disability and decreased quality of life. 5-7 Three approaches are commonly used to treat such patients with inhibitors: (i) administ ration of bypassing agentsc when a bleed occurs (on -demand), (ii) administ ration of bypassing agents prophylactically to prevent bleeds from or (iii) initia tion of immune tole rance induction (ITI) also referred to as immune tolerance therapy with FVIII concentrate to eradicate the inhibitor followed by long-term maintenance with a lower dose FVIII prophylaxis regimen to prevent bleed s and sustain the inhibitor -free status. 7-9 ITI is currently the only proven method for eradication of inhibitors but there is no consensus regarding the specifics of ITI treatment. The most commonly used regimens in the UK are those recommended in the guidelines produced by the United Kingdom Haem ophilia Centre Doctors' Organisation ( -dose FVIII) and the low -dose Van Creveld regimen (low dose FVIII)). 1.2 Existing national policies and guidance We found no guidance from the National Institute of Health a nd Care Excellence (NICE) on ITI for patients with haemophilia A who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII . 2 Epidemiology FVIII deficiency (haemophilia A) is an X -linked recessive disorder occurring in about 1 in every 5,000 male births ; there is no ethnic predominance .9 Severe haemophilia A (factor levels less than 1%) represent approximately 60% of cases, moderate (factor levels of 1 to 5%) represent approximately 15% of cases and m ild (factor levels of 6% to 30%) represent approximately 25% of cases . 11 A systematic review of the epidemiology of inhibitors in patients with haemophilia A reported an overall inhibitor prevalence of 5 to 7%. However the prevalence is much higher at 12 to 13% amongst patients with severe disease.12 In 2011/12, about 7.5% of patients with severe haemophilia A on the United Kingdom Haemophilia Centre Doctors' Organisation (UKHCDO ) register were reported to have inhibitors. The prevalence of new FVIII inhibitors in patients with severe FVIII deficiency ranged from 0% to 39%. About 60% of these inhibitors are high titre (>5 BU) and the remaining are low titre (<5 BU) , patients are defined as high and low responders respectively .12 Most patients develop an inhibitor within a relatively short time period of exposure, with a medi an of 9 -12 exposure days. 12 Very little is actually known about the natural long term history of inhibitors in absence of ITI, but it is possible that spontaneous inhibitor clearance can occur in about 30 to 60 % of patients with haemophilia A over time without treatment with ITI. This information comes from exploratory studies therefore more research is required in this area to establish this. 4 A number of facto rs are thought to be predictive of poor response to ITI ; failure of a previous ITI, inhibito r titre 10 BU at ITI start, peak titre higher than 200 BU, age at ITI start over 7 years old and more than 24 months between inhibitor diagnosis and ITI start.14 c Bypassing agents are agents that are able to bypass the factor VIII -dependent s tep in the clotting cascade and promote h aemostasis by enhancing thrombin generation. FOR PUBLIC CONSULATION ONLY 4 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT 23-Oct-15 3 The intervention The only proven method for eradicati ng inhibitors is immune tolerance indu ction (ITI). ITI is the regular infusion of FVIII to induce FVIII antigen -specific tolerance. There are a number of ITI protocols; the most common are the Bonn protocol (high -dose FVIII twice daily), the low -dose Van Creveld regimen (low dose FVIII every o ther day) and the Malm\u00f6 protocol G ( IgG) and cyclophosphamide) . There is currently no consensus regarding the specifics of ITI treatment, including the factor product source (plasma -derived versus recombinant), factor dose, timing or the use of immune modulation.13 However the regimes recommended by UKHCDO working group are very widely used in the UK.10 4 Findings We carried out literature search es on 6 August 2015 . We searched Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Libra ry, Trip, DARE and NHS Evidence for systematic reviews, clinical trials, comparative studies and economic evaluations of ITI for patients with haemophilia A w ith inhibitors to factor VIII . We also searched PubMed for the last three months for any recent e - publications ahead of print publication. The search was limited to English language publications in the last 10 years. We identified two systematic reviews8, 9 assessing the effects of ITI for treating inhibitors in people with haemophilia A . We did not f ind any RCTs or comparative studies published subsequent to the systematic review s; however , we identified one retrospective study13 and one prospective observational study14. We have included these studies because the systematic review only identified and included one RCT. We identified four economic evaluations of ITI for patients with haemophilia A who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII 16-19 of which we have reported t hree. We did not include o ne study because the authors only reported total cost s for the different treatment strategies compared. The authors state that they could not carry out a cost -effectiveness analysis due to lack of evidence and data on the effects of long -term clinical outcomes and quality of life of haemophilia patients as w ell as long -term direct and indirect costs. 4.1 Evidence of effectiveness Berntorp et al8 carried out a systematic review of the treatment of haemophilia A and B and of von Willebrand disease. This review included the evaluation of the efficacy of different treatment regimens to induce immune tolerance. This section of the review included 24 studies, all uncontrolled. The authors reported that most of the studies showed 70 to 80 percent successd (complete or partial) rate but state that the studies were dif ficult to compare because the products, doses, dose intervals and definitions varied. d Complete success (CS) is defined as having undetectable inhibitor titre [<0.6 Bethesda Units (BU)] at 33 months of ITI, FVII I recovery 66% and half -life 7 h; partial success (PS) is defined as having a reduction in inhibitor titre to <5 BU per mL with FVIII recovery <66% and/or FVIII half -life <6 h associated with clinical response to FVIII therapy not followed by a treatment -limiting anamnestic rise in inhibitors to >5 BU per mL. FOR PUBLIC CONSULATION ONLY 5 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT 23-Oct-15 These results should be interpreted with caution given that all of the studies were uncontrolled with limited statistical outcomes data. The bias associated with the stu dies included mean s that the findings reported may not be valid and/or generalisable. Athale et al9 reviewed evidence on the effect of ITI to remove inhibitors in people with haemophilia A and B (different protocols of this therapy versus each other, or v ersus only bypassing agents) . This Cochrane review included one randomised controlled trial (RCT) 13; the authors found another RCT which had been stopped so this was not included. They did not find any randomised controlled trial -based comparison of ITI with alternate treatment schemes (i.e. bypassing agents for bleeding only). See Table 1 for a summary of results . The included RCT13 randomised 115 children with severe haemophilia A with first attempt at ITI to either low dose (50 IU/kg of factor VIII con centrate three times per week) or a high dose (200 IU/kg of factor VIII daily). The study only included patients who had a high chance of responding to ITI treatment (good riske).The authors did not find any statistically significant d ifference in the successf of ITI between treatment arms . However, the trial was underpowered and did not exclude a material difference in outcome between the treatments. The low -dose arm had significantly more bleeding than the high -dose arm but the confidence interval was ver y wide. The authors concluded that , although there were no significant differences in success rate between the two dosing regimens, this may have been due to the imprecision of the estimate. The review was very well conducted with a clear record of how it was carried out. The included RCT was of fairly good quality with a low risk of bias; patients were computer -randomised; while there were some dropouts and withdrawals, they were well balanced across treatment arms. There was no reporting of blinding; how ever given the intervention it was not feasible to blind participants to their treatment but outcome assessors could have been blinded. Oldenburg et al14 reported on the effectiveness of ITI in a retrospective cohort study, which included adults and ch ildren. Data from 60 patients with haemophilia A (FVIII< 2%) and inhibitors from 22 centres in Spain, Italy and Germany who underwent primary or rescueg ITI (with poor risk factorsh) with plasma von Willebrand factor ( pdFVIII/VWF ) concentra te, were collected. A total of 41 cases of primary ITI and 19 cases of rescue ITI were evaluated. A success (complete and partial success ) rate of 88% was reported in primary ITI and 74% in rescue ITI. The authors concluded that the results of the study j ustify the use of rescue (patients who had a lower chance of responding to ITI) as well as primary ITI. Kreuz et al15 carried out an open -label, uncontrolled, observational ITI study to evaluate the effectiveness of ITI. The 48 pa rticipants (with poor ris k factors) in this interim analysis received FVIII co ncentrate (pdFVIII/VWF) for ITI. 'Low responders' at the start of ITI (<5 BU) received 50 to 100 IU/kg FVIII daily or eve ry other day and 'high responders' (5 BU) received 100 IU/kg FVIII Partial response required achievement of one of the following three criteria; inhibitor titre [<0.6 Bethesda Units (BU), FVII I recovery of the predefined reference value of 1.5% per IU per kg an d half -life 7 h e Good risk patients refers to patients who have not failed previous ITI, peak titre higher between 5 and 200 BU, age at ITI start under 7 years old and less than 24 months between inhibitor diagnosis and ITI start. f Negative inhibitor ti ter, FVIII recovery > 66% of expected, and FVIII recovery > 6 h g Rescue patients were defined as those who had previously undergone at least one ITI course using rFVIII or pdFVIII concentrat e and failed. h Patients with p oor risk factors are those who hav e one or more of the following risks; failure of a previo us ITI, inhibitor titre 10 BU at ITI start, peak titre higher than 200 BU, age at ITI start over 7 years old and more than 24 months between inhibitor diagnos is and ITI start. FOR PUBLIC CONSULATION ONLY 6 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT 23-Oct-15 every 12 h. The authors reported that 34 patients (70.8%) achieved complete success , three (6.3%) partial success and one (2.1%) partial responsei; ITI failed in 10 patients (20.8%). The authors concluded that treatment with pdFVIII/VWF concentrate, mainly according to the Bonn protocol, resulted in a high ITI success rate in haemophilia A patients with inhibitors and poor prognosis for ITI success. The results from these two studies should be interpreted with caution because without control arms, it is difficult to draw any co nclusions as the successes reported may not all be as a result of the treatment. i Partial response required achievement of one of the following three criteria ; inhibitor titre [<0.6 Bethesda Units (BU) , FVIII recovery the predefined reference value of 1.5% per IU per kg and half -life 7 h FOR PUBLIC CONSULATION ONLY 7 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT 23-Oct-15 Table 1: Summary of results Study Population Intervention Comparator Outcomes/Results Athale et al 20148 1 RCT - Hay et al. 201213 70 centres (17 countries) Paedi atric male patients < 7 years old (10.7 to 25.3 months) with severe haemophilia A with factor inhibitory antibodies Peak historical inhibitor titre 5 to 200 BU per ml n=115 Only 'good risk' patients were included Low dose ITI (50 IU/kg factor VIII 3 - times per week) High dose ITI (200 IU/kg of factor VIII daily) Total ITI successj (LD vs. HD) - 115 patients 24/58 - 46.6% vs. 22/57 - 38.6% Risk ratio 1.07 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.68) p=0.909 All bleeding effects (LD vs. HD) - 115 patients 50/58 -86.2% vs. 36/5 7 - 63.1% Risk ratio 1.36 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.71) p=0.0019 CVAD infections(LD vs. HD) - 99 patients with 40.4% vs.22/52 - 42.3% Risk ratio 0.96 (95% CI 0.60 to 1.53) no p value reported Oldenburg et al 201414 Retrospective cohort study 22 cen tres in Germany, Italy and Spain Children (49) and adult (11) patients with severe or moderately severe haemophilia A with inhibitors (FVIII<2%) n=60 Included patients with risk factors associated with poor ITI prognosis Primary ITI n=41 (32 children and 9 adults) Dose range - 40IU/kg FVIII 3 times a week to 300IU/kg every 12 hours Rescue ITI n=19 (17 children and 2 adults) Dose range - 40IU/kg FVIII 3 times a week to 150IU/kg every 12 hours ITI success (CS + PS) - Primary vs. Rescuek 88% vs.74% Complete success - Primary vs. Rescue 63.4% vs. 36.8% Partial success 24.4% vs. 36.8% Failure 12.2% vs. 26.3% No p values reported No comparative data on bleeding was reported CVAD infections - Primary vs. Rescue 4 vs. 3 (n o p values reported ) Kreuz et al 201515 27 centres (13 countries) Male patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors and risk factors associated with poor ITI prognosis* n=48 'Low responders ' at ITI start (<5 BU) received 50 to 100 IU/kg FVIII daily, or every other day; 'high responders ' (5 BU) received 100 IU /kg FVIII every 12 h.

FOR PUBLIC CONSULATION ONLY 9 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT 23-Oct-15 4.2 Trials in progress Our search of clinicaltrials.gov (search date 15 September 2015) identified two studies: NCT02479087: Safety/Efficacy Study of i mmune tolerance induction, by Factor VIII concentrate containing von Willebrand factor, in severe or moderate haemophilia in patients with inhibitors . The estimated study completion date is January 2020.20. NCT01051544: Randomised study of first time immunotolerance induction in severe haemophilia A patients with inhibitor at high risk of failure: comparison with FVIII concentrates with or without Von Willebrand factor - RES.I.S.T. Naive (RESIST NAIVE). The estimated study completion date is June 202 0.14 4.3 Evidence of cost -effectiveness Earnshaw et al16 (2015) carried out a study using a decision -analytic model to compare lifetime costs of treating patients with severe haemophilia A with inhibitors using on -demand or prophylaxis treatment with bypassing agents and ITI (high dose FVIII). Data on respon se to ITI and reduction in bleeding events for patients on prophylaxis and after eradication of inhibitors when on ITI and relapse of inhibitors w ere derived from published studies. Costs were obtained from standard US costing sources and are reported in 2 014 US dollars. The authors report that patients treated via ITI or prophylactically with bypassing agents, respectively, incurred approximately 77% and 61% fewer bleeding events over their lifetime compared to patients treated via on -demand therapy. In a ddition, patients treated via ITI were projected to live 4.3 years longer than patients on prophylaxis and on -demand therapy and have 4.3 and 9.9 more QALYs than patients on prophylaxis and on -demand therapy respectively. As a result, the estimated lifetim e costs of treating patients with inhibitors was lower for ITI compared with either on -demand treatment or prophylaxis with bypassing agents. ITI is dominant (i.e. less costly and more effective in terms of reducing bleeding events and increasing QALYs). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that ITI had a probability of 84% of being lower cost, and was cost -effective (ICER $50 000) compared with prophylaxis under all the conditions modelled . In comparing ITI with on -demand treatment, probabilistic se nsitivity analysis showed that ITI was cost-saving under 53% of conditions modelled. With a threshold of $100 000 (\u00a366,600 ), ITI was cost-effective under 61% of modelled, and with one of $50 000 (\u00a333,300 ), it was cost effective in 64% of conditi ons. However, there is a fair amount of uncertainty around these results. The analysis was fairly well conducted with data sources and assumptions clearly reported. However, the study had a number of limitations. The analysis examined the impact of one IT I dose protocol. In reality, haemophilia treatment centres utilise different ITI protocols. Also the comparison of ITI and prophylaxis approaches with on -demand treatment is based on evidence from uncontrolled studies . The generalisability of these cost s and cost -effectiveness estimates to the NHS setting in England is unknown. Rasekh et al17 (2011) carried out a cost-utility analysis in Iran of ITI therapy with plasma -derived factor VIII concentrates versus on -demand treatment with recombinant -activated F VIIa (rFVIIa) in haemophilia A patients with high titre inhibitors. This study was based on a previous cost - effectiveness study carried out in the UK. To adapt the previous study, the authors replaced the cost data with Iranian estimates of resource use. Three ITI regimens for inhibitor eradication and FOR PUBLIC CONSULATION ONLY 10 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT 23-Oct-15 one on -demand strategy were considered: high -dose Bonn protocol , low-dose van Creveld (Dutch) protocol, Malm\u00f6 protocol and an on -demand regimen with rFVIIa. The authors reported that all ITI regimens were d ominant over on -demand treatment, which was both less effective and more expensive. Among the ITI strategies, low -dose dominated Malm\u00f6; the incremental cost per QALY gained with the Bonn over Malm\u00f6 regimens was $249, 400 (\u00a3164 ,600) and the incremental cost per QALY gained with the Bonn regimen over low -dose was $842,30 0 (\u00a3556,000). The authors concluded that a low -dose ITI protocol was the most cost - effective option versus both other ITI regimens and on -demand treatment with rFVIIa. The selection of compara tors in this analysis was appropriate as the available treatment strategies for this patient population in the authors' setting were considered. Dosages and administration times were reported clearly. The study relied on a previous cost -effectiveness model but the authors did not report the methodological characteristics of the model or the design of the studies from which clinical parameters were taken. No Iranian estimates were found and no sensitivity analysis was conducted, so it was not possible to jud ge the validity of the clinical side of the study. The economic analysis included only the costs of the treatments. The authors pointed out that the cost of clotting factor concentrates accounted for 98% of total costs. However, it is unclear if the inclusion of other direct medical and indirect costs would have substantially altered the results of the analysis. The cost of clotting factors was varied in the sensitivity analyses but the results were not reported. The authors acknowledged some limitations of their analysis related mainly to the need for assumptions and lack of Iranian data. The study results are unlikely to be relevant to the England NHS setting. Knight et al18 (2003) carried out a systematic review of the cost-effectiveness of treatment o ptions in patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors. However, because of the paucity of published evidence , they undertook an economic modelling exercise to calculate the cost -effectiveness of different strategies in the treatment of high -responding haem ophilia A patients with inhibitors. They used a decision analysis approach to model the expected lifetime clinical outcomes and costs of the more common regimens used in the UK in treating severe haemophiliacs with inhibitors. Three ITI (Bonn, Malm\u00f6 and lo w-dose) and three on -demand regimens were compared. The results of the economic modelling indicate that the Malm\u00f6 ITI protocol is the preferred treatment strategy for haemophilia A patients who have high -responding inhibitors , generating more quality adju sted life -years (QALYs) and less cost than either an on -demand regimen or the Bonn or low-dose ITI protocols. The Bonn ITI protocol had highest cost but generate d the largest gain in QALYs (33.1) because it is the most successful ITI protocol. The low-dose ITI protocol costs less than the Bonn ITI protocol but has fewer QALYs gained (29.1) . The Malm\u00f6 ITI protocol had the lowest average lifetime cost but the fewest QALYs gained (28.1) above the OD protocol (25.1) . The Malm\u00f6 ITI protocol dominates the on-demand strategy as it has both a lower average lifetime cost and higher QALYs gained (cost/QALY not stated) . The cost/QALY gained for the low-dose ITI protocol compared with the on-demand protocol was around \u00a356 ,000. The cost/QALY gained for the Bonn ITI pr otocol compared with the on-demand protocol was around \u00a3148 ,000. Sensitivity analysis did not have any major effects on the results of the cost -effectiveness analysis with the Malm\u00f6 ITI protocol remaining dominant most of the time. However , the sensitivit y FOR PUBLIC CONSULATION ONLY 11 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT 23-Oct-15 analysis of the treatment duration for the low-dose ITI protocol showed that, if the duration of treatment was reduced while still maintaining the same success rate, the low-dose ITI protocol would become the preferred choice of treatment compared with t he on demand regimens. The Malm\u00f6 ITI protocol is not that widely used within the UK. The analysis was well conducted with all assumptions, sources of data and cost clearly reported. One of the limitations of this study is that the ITI strategies were not compared to prophylactic treatment with bypassing agents. Also because the analysis was carried out in 2003, the management strategies compared and the relative costs are likely to be out of date. 4.4 Safety The RCT conducted by Hay et al. reported that central venous access device ( CVAD ) infection was the most common complication observed in children with severe haemophilia and inhibitors. A total of 124 CVAD infections were reported in 41 of 99 (41%) subjects with an overall infection rate of 0.94 per 1000 CVAD -days . A similar number of infections were observed in the two treatment arms. Infections occurred more frequently in the presence of external catheters than with fully implanted catheters (P = 0.026) . ITI outcome was unaffected by CVAD infections. Other adverse events reported include haemarthrosis, febrile convulsion, gingivitis and allergic reaction to FVIII. 4.5 Summary of section 4 Clinical effectiveness Evidence from one RCT (115 patients with good risk ) showed no statistically significant differen ce in the success of ITI between low-dose and high -dose ITI treatment arms in patients with haemophilia A with inhibitors however; the confidence intervals were too wide to infer no effect . The low -dose arm had significantly more bleeding than the high -dose arm for this reason the study was stopped early but again the confidence interval was very wide. Uncontrolled studies report that ITI has a 70 to 80 percent success rate in haemophilic patients with inhibitors. Because spontaneous clearance of inhibitor s might have occurred in some of the participants without ITI, these studies form an unreliable basis for estimating the effectiveness of the treatment. Cost-effectiveness We have reported three economic evaluations (from Iran, the USA and the UK) of ITI for patients with haemophilia A who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII. All the three studies suggest that ITI is cost -effective compared to prophylaxis and o n-demand treatment with bypassing agents. However the analyses are based mostly on low quali ty clinical evidence. Safety Central venous access device ( CVAD ) infection was the most common complication observed in children with severe haemophilia and inhibitors in the frame of the I -ITI study. Other adverse events reported include haemarthrosis, f ebrile convulsion, gingivitis and allergic reaction to FVIII. FOR PUBLIC CONSULATION ONLY 12 | EVIDENCE SUMMARY REPORT 23-Oct-15 5 Discussion and conclusions What is the evidence for the clinical effectiveness of ITI for patients with haemophilia A who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII? Evidence from one RCT sugges ts that there are no significant differences in the ITI success rates between high -dose and low -dose FVIII regimens in paediatric patients with haemophilia A who have developed inhibitors and have an expected favourable response to ITI . These results are applicable to this patient group however; it is unclear if th ey would be valid in patients with risk factors associated with poor ITI prognosis. We also found some evidence to suggest that ITI with high -dose FVIII may be associated with fewer bleeding episodes ; the RCT was stopped early because of safety concerns as there were significantly more bleeding events in the low -dose arm compared to the high -dose arm. Uncontrolled studies suggest that ITI has beneficial effects on patients with haemophilia A who have developed inhibitors. It is hard to gauge the extent to which these results can be attributed to ITI, or might have occurred spontaneously, but the studies are certainly compatible with a treatment effect. Retrospective analyses also tend not to docum ent failures, so this could also have exaggerated the effect size in retrospective studies . We did not identify any studies comparing ITI with alternative treatment schemes. What is the evidence for the cost - effectiveness of ITI for patients with haemophi lia A who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII? Evidence from one the only UK conducted economic analysis suggests that the Malmo protocol is the most cost-effective ITI regimen. The sensitivity analysis carried out suggests that low dose ITI is likely to be the most cost -effective ITI regimen in the UK compared to on -demand therapy . However a s the analysis was carried out in 2003, the relative costs and treatment strategies are likely to be out of date. In fact evidence from one RCT shows that low dose ITI is associated with significantly more bleeding compared with high dose ITI and this will not only reduce the patients' quality of life, it is likely to increase the costs because of the us e of bypassing agents for the treatment of bleeds.

How can they be best described? Are there subgroup s that need to be considered? Adults and children with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitor, demonstrated on more than one occasion by a Nijmegen -modified Bethesda assay, that interferes with prophylaxis or treatment of bleeds at standard doses of FVIII (Around 25 -30% of children with severe haemophilia A form antibodies against administered factor VIII after commencing treatment. In 2011/12 there were 46 new patients with severe haemophilia A registered on the UKHCDO database. Of these, 35 were under the age of 19 years. The incidence of haemophilia A patients under the age of 19 years in the UK who develop inhibitors is likely to be around 9 -12 per year.) I - Intervention Which intervent ion, treatment or approach should be used? Immune tolerance therapy administered in accordance with UKHCDO protocol for first line immune tolerance induction for children with severe haemophilia A: UKHCDO Inhibitor and Paediatric Working Parties -21st January 2013 N.b. has application for adults too. C - Comparison What is/ are the main alternative/s to compare with the intervention being considered? The two principle products available for this are recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa, Novoseven) and factor VIII bypassing agen t (FEIBA). Any intervention O - Outcomes What is really important for the patient? Which outcomes should be considered? Examples include intermediate or short -term outcomes; mortality; morbidity and quality of life; treatment complications; adverse effects; rates of relapse; late morbidity and re -admission; return to work, physical and social functioning, resource use. Survival Bleeding frequency and severity Inhibitor titre Use/cost of clotting factor products Admissions and hospital attendances Advers e events/safety Joint damage and other complications Loss of education/working days Restriction of daily activities Quality of life. . date: 06 August 2015 Databases searched: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, TRIP, DARE and NICE Evidence Search - limited to studies published in English and last 10 years.
