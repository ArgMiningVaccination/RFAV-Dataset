Before understanding the impact of trends in consumer behavior, we need to understand what factors lead and drive changes around the world. The questions that have to be answered first are: How consumers react to certain changes? What motivations are behind their choices? What kind of channels & brands they are loyal to? It is an alive synergetic and interdependent system that evolves all the time. Global drivers are the first highly influential element. These are external forces which have great potential to change the dynamics of business. They involve long-term issues such as aging populations and urbanization, as well as immediate triggers such as political events, natural disasters and pandemics - like the one we are experiencing. Intertwined with these events are those searching to address human needs or the so called basic needs that arise from these Global Drivers. In the case of COVID-19, for example, consumers are increasingly concerned about finding alternatives to completely protect their health. Finally, we have innovations, which we could say are more of the same, such as face masks and hand sanitizers; novelties. These are normally related to new developments still in the embryonic stage, like possible vaccines. These two types of innovations do not completely solve our needs and we should continue looking for other solutions. Faced with so much unsubstantiated, unqualified and speculative information, how can we as the personal care industry differentiate the signal (a meaningful information which can lead into a trend) from the noise (random fluctuation that does not contain meaningful data)? At DSM, we consider a number of sources such as the most influential communication vehicles in the sector, academic content, research and forums, among others to have a broad perspective. For a trend to be part of the framework, it needs to also be seen emerging in other industries, e.g. Food & Beverage, Travel, and Fashion industry. Once this is the case, we then classify it as signal and not a noise. Innovations have a much higher chance to hit the sweet spot when they are inspired by selected trends observed in diverse situations. We have a framework that's dynamic and constantly updated, and it builds the fundament of our research to develop personal care ingredients that enable our customers to offer products of true value to their consumers. With this framework in mind, we are able to anticipate new manifestations that help us to develop new ingredients, solutions, and concepts ahead of the market and hit the sweet spot! According to the structure above and looking at the evolution of the pandemic globally, some trends and developments are affected more. This highlights the term [Conscious Beauty](https://www.dsm.com/personal-care/en_US/trends/good-beauty-trend/conscious-beauty-2020.html), which describes the growth of more responsible consumers, aware and mindful of the origin of the products they use. During these unprecedent times consumers awareness increased on how businesses interact with stakeholders, local communities, and society more broadly. The actions that businesses take during this pandemic are likely to be remembered long after COVID-19 has been conquered. This can be related to product packaging, eco-friendliness of the product, or a companies' purpose and value. A good example of DSM's solutions and innovation to meet the expectations of this new consumer is the [ALPAFLOR](https://www.dsm.com/personal-care/en_US/products/skin-bioactives/alpaflor-edelweiss.html)\u00ae line, a globally recognized standard for organic bioactives certified by Fair Trade, Ecocert, Cosmos and Natrue. Social isolation has confirmed something we already knew: new technologies have changed our lives forever. We want simple, fast and efficient solutions. With this in mind, the expression Instant Beauty stands out, which embodies the search for products that offer immediate results. An innovation to meet this demand is the [SYN-GLOW\u00ae](https://www.dsm.com/personal-care/en_US/products/skin-bioactives/syn-glow.html) pentapeptide, which partners with skin to reveal its natural sun-kissed tone and also strengthens skin defenses from within. Social distancing and an unprecedent future trigger now, more than ever, the importance of products that provide us with experiences that can maintain our mental and emotional balance. That is what the trend expression Inner Balance is about, which gave rise to the conceptual formulation line of [Recovery Salon](#download) products. With revitalizing ingredients such as [BEL-EVEN](https://www.dsm.com/personal-care/en_US/products/skin-bioactives/bel-even.html)\u00ae, an ingredient which locally rebalances the negative, long-term effects of stress on skin, this line is born from the need to recreate life's pre-pandemic rituals into our new self-care routine. Exploring this trend, related to the search for beauty based on the preservation of health, the expression Preventive Beauty stands out. Here, consumers care about their health at a much earlier stage in their life. For example, we realize many millennials are now buying anti-aging products without having fine-lines or wrinkles. Another emerging trend is immediate care: with this as the focus, DSM's [PENTAVITIN](https://www.dsm.com/personal-care/en_US/products/skin-bioactives/pentavitin.html)\u00ae presented itself as an innovation against the effects of dry skin caused by excessive hygiene, strengthening natural defense barriers and providing deep & lasting hydration. At any time, new consumer needs and expectations can arise. AT DSM Personal Care & Aroma Ingredients the focus is to provide the industry with personal care ingredients capable of accompanying these developments in a consistent and meaningful way. We have taken a look at the growing enthusiasm for medical beauty, and the products serving this trend, to ensure we offer customers the best skin care ingredients for non-invasive solutions. Consumers more and more value \"feel-good\", \"guilt-free\" and products they can trust. DSM's latest market study shows that this enthusiasm for \"Good Beauty\" has various personal care trend expressions. There is evidence that doing something to nurture the skin can be beneficial, because it involves taking a little bit of time for ourselves. DSM's latest research has found that the Mindful Beauty trend can be articulated in two types of trend expressions. "}
