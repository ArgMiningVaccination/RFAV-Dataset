In particular, the United Houma Nation (UHN) has faced large land loss and trauma, dispossession, and marginalization. Given the paucity of research addressing health for Indigenous individuals living in Louisiana, this study sought to co-identify a United Houma Nation health framework, by co-developing a community land-based healing approach in order to inform future community-based health prevention programs. (2) Methods: This pilot tested, co-designed and implemented a land-based healing pilot study among Houma women utilizing a health promotion leadership approach and utilized semi-structured interviews among 20 UHN women to identify a UHN health framework to guide future results. (3) Results: The findings indicated that RTOR was a feasible pilot project. The initial themes were (1.) place, (2.) environmental/land trauma, (3.) ancestors, (4.) spirituality/mindfulness, (5.) cultural continuity, and (6.) environment and health. The reconnection to land was deemed feasible and seen as central to renewing relationships with ancestors (aihalia asanochi taha), others, and body. This mindful, re-engagement with the land contributed to subthemes of developing stronger tribal identities, recreating ceremonies, and increased cultural continuity, and transforming narratives of trauma into hope and resilience. Based on these findings a Houma Health (Uma Hochokma) Framework was developed and presented. (4) Conclusions: Overall, this study found that land can serve as a feasible therapeutic site for healing through reconnecting Houma tribal citizens to both ancestral knowledges and stories of resilience, as well as viewing self as part of a larger collective. These findings also imply that revisiting historically traumatic places encouraged renewed commitment to cultural continuity and health behaviors\u2014particularly when these places are approached relationally, with ceremony, and traumatic events tied to these places, including climate change and environmental/land trauma, are acknowledged along with the love the ancestors held for future generations.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-09-03", "cleaned_text": "Returning to Our Roots: Tribal Health and Wellness through Land-Based Healing [https://doi.org/10.3390/genealogy4030091](https://doi.org/10.3390/genealogy4030091) [Community-Engaged Indigenous Research al. 2020](#B36-genealogy-04-00091); [Walters et al. 2011](#B71-genealogy-04-00091)). This settler colonialism has been described as a systematic imperial act of taking territory by force in distant lands and replacing the population with new settlers ( [Wolfe 2006](#B76-genealogy-04-00091)). Throughout US history, settler colonialism has structurally sought to erase Indigenous people through genocidal (e.g., Indian Removals), ethnocidal (systematic destruction of lifeways; e.g., Boarding Schools), and/or epistemicidal (systematic destruction of thought ways/languages; e.g., outlawing Indian spiritual or cultural practices) policies and practices. These methods have been used to displace or dispossess Indigenous people from their traditional homelands, lifeways, and identities ( [Walters et al. 2018](#B72-genealogy-04-00091)); and the effects have reverberated throughout subsequent generations. As such, settler colonialism has been identified as a key social determinant of health for Indigenous peoples and should be considered in health intervention designs ( 2018](#B73-genealogy-04-00091)). empirical findings indicate that after controlling for contemporary trauma\u2014including childhood physical and sexual abuse, as well as adult military combat exposure\u2014historically traumatic land-based events (e.g., forced relocation, loss of land, land desecration) can continue to have a significant effect on contemporary mental and physical health among Indigenous Two Spirit populations ( [Walters et al. 2011](#B71-genealogy-04-00091)). By interrupting connection to land and related Indigenous knowledges, settler colonial land trauma has especially disrupted Indigenous peoples' ability to continue their language, relationships with the land, and spirituality related to place ( [Baskin 2016](#B5-genealogy-04-00091); [Brown et al. 2012](#B9-genealogy-04-00091)). Moreover, these disruptions of intergenerational knowledge transfer inhibit a people's ability to fulfill their Original Instructions (ancient teachings) and responsibilities\u2014thus impacting wellbeing. Original Instructions are tied to land and cosmos and require a relationship between person and place with specific obligations and responsibilities, as described by Tewa scholar, [Gregory Cajete](#B12-genealogy-04-00091)( [1999](#B12-genealogy-04-00091)). Through attempting to sever Indigenous collective identities and disrupt their views of self as connected to the land, settler colonial policies sought to extinguish Indigenous cultures ( [Watts 2013](#B74-genealogy-04-00091)). This systematic disruption to Indigenous land, place, and healing has further exacerbated current environmental stressors; e.g., food deserts; environmental distress, land loss, and ( [Vizenor 2008](#B67-genealogy-04-00091)) of Indigenous peoples in holding on to deep cultural threads of knowledge and practices that endure to this day\" ( [Walters et al. 2018](#B72-genealogy-04-00091)). This land-health connectedness is also reflected by an aboriginal scholar ( [Burgess et al. 2005, p. 120](#B10-genealogy-04-00091)) who notes: \"Our identity as human being remains tied to our land, to our cultural practices, our systems of authority and control, our intellectual traditions, our concepts of spirituality, and to our systems of resource ownership and exchange. Destroy this relationship and you damage sometimes irrevocably\u2014individual human beings and their health.\" 1.1. UHN Returning to Our Roots Background and Health as Related to Lands The United Houma Nation is one of the three largest state-recognized tribes, who do not have access to federal Indian Healthcare Service to help address health disparities or federally entrusted reservation lands (For the Houma, as for all indigenous people, existence is about people and place. our ties to each other and our ties to the land are part of the dynamics of our identity and culture. [Billiot and Parfait 2019](#B7-genealogy-04-00091)). Given high rates of historical traumatic event exposures (e.g., environmental contaminants, forced relocations), oppression, and lack of resources, the UHN currently suffers from diabetes rates as high as 24% of their population ( [UHN 2015](#B66-genealogy-04-00091)), a rate similar to other Indigenous groups. Meanwhile, White settler populations maintain diabetes rates around 8% ( [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/CDC 2020](#B14-genealogy-04-00091)). Furthermore, the UHN population experience cardiovascular disease ( [UHN 2015](#B66-genealogy-04-00091)) as compared to 8.6% of Indigenous peoples in general and 5.8% of the US white population ( [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/CDC 2020](#B14-genealogy-04-00091)). These Indigenous health disparities have been attributed to stressors related to historical i.e., colonization, genocidal, and ethnocide attacks, and current traumas i.e., experienced violence, racial discrimination, and land trauma ( [IHS 2013](#B33-genealogy-04-00091); al. 2018](#B72-genealogy-04-00091)). While western health interventions have not been as effective as hoped for Indigenous groups, especially in terms of diabetes, obesity, and chronic disease ( [Adams et al. 2008](#B1-genealogy-04-00091); [Satterfield et al. 2016](#B61-genealogy-04-00091)), community-engaged approaches show promise and have been deemed critical for Indigenous communities in their ability to self-govern their health, or exercise health sovereignty ( [Jennings et al. 2019](#B35-genealogy-04-00091); [Johnson-Jennings et al. 2019](#B38-genealogy-04-00091), [2020b](#B40-genealogy-04-00091)). Indigenous grassroots efforts; arising from and, or in collaborative partnership with communities, have begun to effectively address obesity food challenges and often center around reconnecting with land and increasing traditional foods, or Indigenous foods historically linked to Indigenous communities ( [Johnson-Jennings et al. 2020a](#B39-genealogy-04-00091); [Satterfield et al. 2016](#B61-genealogy-04-00091)). In particular, Indigenous groups' reconnection to land may be key in addressing obesity and other chronic health diseases. Given the paucity of research addressing health for Indigenous individuals living in Louisiana, this study sought to co-identify a United Houma Nation health framework, drawing from a land-based healing approach in order to inform future community-based chronic disease prevention programs. [UHN 2015](#B66-genealogy-04-00091)). At contact, ancestors of UHN lived on the most fertile ground of what became the Louisiana Territory. Settler colonial land laws of the French, Spanish, and U.S. subsequently displaced UHN ancestors further and further down the Mississippi River until arriving at the present-day location along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. It is on the bayous of the Mississippi that UHN thrived and built relationships with the land and water. Although the coastal Houma territories are geographical food deserts, UHN has been able to communally provide for tribal citizens through subsistence activities such as fishing and hunting, which have minimized food insecurities. Recently, human activities causing highly contaminated waters and coastal erosion drastically decreased acreage for gardening, leading many UHN tribal citizens to rely upon commodity food distributions and woefully inadequate grocery stores, instead of a diet rich in fresh, protein-packed seafood ( [Billiot and Parfait 2019](#B7-genealogy-04-00091)). For instance, UHN has endured land trauma via oil rig drilling, dam construction, and dredging swamplands, which have contaminated their seafood and environment. Between 2010 and 2015, 35% of all UHN citizens reported that they continue to be negatively affected, especially in terms of health and wellbeing, by the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill ( [UHN 2015](#B66-genealogy-04-00091)). UHN has further experienced global environmental changes ( [Billiot 2017](#B6-genealogy-04-00091)). They, subsequently, have significantly less land in which to farm, garden, hunt, and, overall, feed themselves. UHN citizens have reported moving from working outdoors daily and consuming diets rich in fresh seafood and vegetables, towards the poor eating habits of many Americans\u2014including the increased consumption of processed foods and sedentary employment. All of which are having devastating health effects among many Indigenous groups ( [Jennings et al. 2019](#B35-genealogy-04-00091)). By enduring such land trauma and inability to access and engage in ancestral practices, UHN's relationships with land and ancestors have been limited. They have also been unable to continue passing such practices onto future generations; or in other words, they are unable to maintain their cultural continuity ( [Champagne 2007](#B15-genealogy-04-00091)). This inability for Indigenous nations to continue their culture has been found to negatively impact tribal citizens' physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health ( [Gracey and King 2009](#B28-genealogy-04-00091); [King et al. 2009](#B43-genealogy-04-00091)). Thus, it is unsurprising, that UHN has high rates of both diabetes and heart disease, even higher than other Indigenous groups ( [UHN 2015](#B66-genealogy-04-00091)). These disparate rates, originally, initiated UHN to identify their views of health as related to the land and to determine if the land would serve as an appropriate context for healing. 1.2. Houma Reconnecting with the Land for Cultural Continuity and Healing [Champagne 2007](#B15-genealogy-04-00091); [Chandler and Lalonde 2016](#B16-genealogy-04-00091); al. 2005](#B54-genealogy-04-00091)). The UHN has experienced large land dispossessions, which has isolated communities, and hampered their ability to fluidly transmit land-based teachings ( [Billiot et al. 2019](#B78-genealogy-04-00091)). Hence, the UHN leadership, elders, and key stakeholders proposed that reconnecting to the land needs to be considered in order to increase cultural knowledges around health. Other Indigenous groups who have re-established relationships to ceremonial spaces and the wisdom of their ancestors have also improved or see the potential to improve health ( [Agans et al. 2014](#B2-genealogy-04-00091); [Carroll et al. 2018](#B13-genealogy-04-00091); [Dobson and Brazzoni 2016](#B24-genealogy-04-00091))). Indigenous ancestral wise practices differ from western best practices in that they elevate ancestral and Indigenous ecological knowledges and may hold more promise than western approaches for improving health ( [Johnson-Jennings et al. 2020a](#B39-genealogy-04-00091)). In addition, the UHN leadership also voiced that Indigenous knowledges need to be learned through the direct, lived experiences on the land. As noted by other researchers (e.g., [Jennings and Lowe 2014](#B34-genealogy-04-00091); learning from the land includes fostering interconnectedness between individuals and their environment or landscape, with this relationship being primary to healing. Therefore, re-establishing land connections and relationships through place-based learning opportunities may be appropriate and necessary to improving Indigenous health ( [Anderson et al. 2011](#B3-genealogy-04-00091); [Dobson and Brazzoni 2016](#B24-genealogy-04-00091)). 1.3. Land as an Appropriate Healing Context for Houma [Brown et al. 2012](#B9-genealogy-04-00091); [Luig et al. 2011](#B45-genealogy-04-00091); [Walters et al. 2018](#B72-genealogy-04-00091)). The interdependency among humans and nature, the physical and spiritual worlds, the ancestors (past, present, and future), and all living beings (animate and inanimate) are bound to one another in what [Cajete](#B12-genealogy-04-00091)( [1999](#B12-genealogy-04-00091)) refers to as a sacred ecology\u2014an interconnectedness deeply reflecting spirituality and cultural cosmology tied to place. The field of geography has often discussed humans and land in terms of place, described as the human attachment of meaning to a physical space or location ( [Kearns and Moon 2002](#B42-genealogy-04-00091)). This western, unidirectional lens perceives place as being contrived within the minds of the human who consciously decide, or change, the meaning as based on both emotions and experiences\u2014including positive and negative/traumatic connections, as well as socio-political constructs ( [Manzo 2005](#B47-genealogy-04-00091)). More recently a westernized, relational view to place and health has been proposed, which includes viewing factors such as environmental hazards, or lack of access to supports, or healthcare, and a reciprocal influence of place on individual's health ( [Cummins et al. 2007](#B20-genealogy-04-00091)). Yet, [Johnson-Jennings et al.](#B40-genealogy-04-00091)( [2020b](#B40-genealogy-04-00091)) found that Indigenous peoples hold more than a unidirectional relational view of the land; instead viewing an interrelationship with the land who is an animate, living entity- a mother. [Johnson-Jennings et al. 2020b](#B40-genealogy-04-00091)). Even more, Indigenous land-based initiatives are entrenched within community knowledge, guided by community elders and knowledge keepers, and often arise from the community as grassroots initiatives, sometimes in partnership with Indigenous and allied scientists (see [Billiot 2017](#B6-genealogy-04-00091); [Jennings et al. al. 2011](#B71-genealogy-04-00091); [Walters et al. 2018](#B72-genealogy-04-00091)). Thus, engaging upon the land can serve as a potentially effective and sustainable approach to health. The UHN leadership and researchers agreed that a land-based health intervention could illuminate how tribal citizens perceive health and wellbeing. 1.4. Indigenous Land-Based Healing as a Potential Houma Framework [Johnson-Jennings et al. 2020a](#B39-genealogy-04-00091); [Karanja 2020](#B41-genealogy-04-00091)). Therefore, a land-based healing setting serves as the catalyst for transformation towards wellbeing and health, which will occur over time. Land-based healing has been seen to encourage redeveloping relationships with the land, the environment, and with other humans. Furthermore individuals reconnect to the place of their ancestors, their original instructions, or teachings. They also contextualize their selves as being future ancestors who are responsible for the future generations ( [Johnson-Jennings et al. 2020b](#B40-genealogy-04-00091); [Walters et al. 2018](#B72-genealogy-04-00091)). UHN leadership agreed that land, seen as including the waterways and oceans, holds the unique ability to connect individuals across time and generations. It further creates a mental/abstract space for building relationship and pushing one out their comfort zone ( [Fernandez et al. 2020](#B26-genealogy-04-00091); [Johnson-Jennings et al. 2016](#B63-genealogy-04-00091)). [Walsh et al. 2018](#B69-genealogy-04-00091)). This relationship with place is, thereby, inextricably linked to Indigenous traditional ways of being in relation with relatives. Metaphorical examples of relational place orientations can be seen in Indigenous constructs of place as relational referents, such as to \"mother earth\" or to rocks as \"grandfathers.\" Walters and colleagues [Walters et al. 2011, p. 168](#B71-genealogy-04-00091)) note: \"We converse with place as if with relatives. Place is part of our ancestral heritage, our present, and our future. It links us in immediate and visceral ways to our past, present, and future. In this sense, Indigenous peoples emerge from the place and have a bidirectional relationship of caring with place\u2014place cares for us and we care for it.\" Houma people, who have many stories of wind and water, have been described as being acutely attuned to their sense of place, especially during times of hurricane or disaster ( [Dardar 2008](#B23-genealogy-04-00091)). They further have been described as collectively uniting to recover from devastation in a calm and caring ways ( [D'Oney 2008](#B22-genealogy-04-00091)). For this study, UHN leadership reiterated their view of land as important for health and their need to collectively address their health in place. [Johnson-Jennings et al. 2020b](#B40-genealogy-04-00091); [Parlee et al. 2005](#B54-genealogy-04-00091); [Walters et al. 2018](#B72-genealogy-04-00091)). Given that land can be seen as embodying trauma\u2014especially if individuals have not often visited the location ( [Manzo 2005](#B47-genealogy-04-00091)), transforming narratives of trauma into resilience can become a powerful reframe to support one's healing journey ( [see Yappalli in Walters et al. 2018](#B72-genealogy-04-00091)). Thus, land-based healing interventions that revisit traumatic places and include cultural interpersonal supports, and therapeutic interventions could provide a venue for transformation of traumatic narratives. In essence, an individual can reflect upon their ancestral narratives/experiences, the land's resilience across time, as well as Indigenous original instruction for health and healing; in doing so, they can begin to craft a narrative of hope and resilience, instead of trauma alone. Being on the land further supports long-term behavioral changes through focusing on the future generations. Land-based healing is particularly important for increasing Indigenous cultural continuity for healing, while addressing the trauma of land dispossession ( [Brown et al. 2012](#B9-genealogy-04-00091)). [Walters et al. 2018](#B72-genealogy-04-00091)). Through focusing on a health promotion leadership model, Yappalli has supported Choctaw women participants becoming community health leaders- while learning ancestral teachings and wisdom around health, wellbeing, and food and land practices. In this way, land serves as an opportunity to transform narratives of trauma into hope and resilience and provides the space and place to reinstate healthy relationships. UHN sought to co-develop a similar intervention for their community with the Yappalli research scientists. 2. UHN Returning to Our Roots Land-Based Healing Intervention Research Design 2.1. Methods [Wallerstein and Duran 2006](#B68-genealogy-04-00091)), the authors co-developed and implemented the United Houma Nation-led, Returning to Our Roots (RTOR), land-based healing pilot that re-traced the forced migration of UHN ancestors to their present-day location. They sought to observe and conduct case studies as UHN mapped the route taken by ancestors to reconnect with traditional, healthy culture and lifestyles to reduce chronic diseases among tribal citizens. This ground-breaking research program drew from the socioecological frameworks ( [Naar-King et al. 2006](#B50-genealogy-04-00091)) to identify the social determinants of health including individual levels of influence through behavioral, physical/built environment, and sociocultural domains of influence (i.e., identifying ancestral teachings and visions for health, that enhance cultural and land connectedness). Additionally, the Indigenist Stress-Coping Model, which emphasizes Indigenous resiliencies and cultural coping factors as buffers for health ( [Walters et al. 2002](#B70-genealogy-04-00091)), undergirded the conceptual focus and 2.2. RTOR 1](#genealogy-04-00091-t001). 2.3. Reflexivity [Table 2](#genealogy-04-00091-t002). 2.4. this study, we utilized two methodological triangulations to analyze data through constant data comparison and NVivo coding. The second triangulation methods utilized was data triangulation in which we analyzed data from observations from pre and post intervention, intervention focus group interviews, and post-intervention individual interviews. [Padgett 2008](#B53-genealogy-04-00091)) but served as an essential component of the intervention. 2.5. Relationship 3. Data Analysis [Saldana 2015](#B60-genealogy-04-00091)). Participants' expressions and vocal emotions were audio recorded and were directly written into hard copy of raw data. This minimized the distortion of the meaning in interview. All interview transcripts were analyzed in similarity and differences, frequency of concepts, sequence of statements, correspondence to events and stimuli, and causation ( [Hatch 2002](#B31-genealogy-04-00091)). The first participant's interview was initially codified with notes being taken, clusters conducted, and then larger categories developed. The codifying process for subsequent interviews influenced the general themes, which were then tabulated based on the data. The authors analyzed each sentence of the participant transcripts, documented the emotional changes in audio records, and transitioned into preliminary coding based on the relationship to the land-based healing. The team integrated and categorized the final codes by the outcome of preliminary codes. 3.1. Findings 3.1.1. Place and Creating Space 3.1.2. Ancestors 3.1.3. Spirituality/Mindfulness 3.1.4. Cultural Continuity 3.1.5. Environment and Health [Jennings and Lowe 2014](#B34-genealogy-04-00091)). For instance, when the \"children don't play outside,\" the participants saw this as unhealthy. Participants further discussed the impact of global warming and climate change. In particular, they noted the change in seasons and weather patterns. \"I've never seen a tornado before when I was growing up until recently. It's like, \"What's going on?\" Is it the green gas? The ozone layers?\" Many also discussed how many places \"looked different,\" \"the trees are dying the water is darker,\" \"the fresh water is not safe to swim in or drink.\" Thus, the health of the environment appeared to influence their view of health today. Secondly, the participants discussed current land traumas including the BP oil spill, the pollution of land and waters, and loss of land by brackish waters. \"What about the natural order of things? At what point are we going to realize we can't keep messing up the natural of things? At some point ... Even with this ... With coastal erosion, and these oil spills, and the oil line, it's like eventually, Mother Nature is going to take back what was hers, whether you give it to her or not. I just really ... I really feel like there needs to be more of an effort for all of us to do our part when it comes to stuff like this.\" Finally, the participants also recognized the impact on the more than human relatives during the intervention and shifted their view of connectedness to their ecology. \"The environment, I've been concerned about the environment... I remember the birds that you pointed out like how the birds were following us. I've kind of been connected. I mean I've always thought about the animals being part of our ancestry, but it wasn't until then that I kind of started doing that, watching for animal reactions, how they are whenever we are around. That was a little bit of a shift.\" 3.2. Feasibility 3.3. Houma Health: The Uma Hochokma Framework [Figure 1](#genealogy-04-00091-f001)depicts a triangular path of mountains or one's life journey, as is traditional to Houma, and related Muskogean cultures. The aligned bottom left and right triangles, or the path of change, were chosen to represent the individual's healing journey of an individual during life's ups and downs. This path begins with the land and water, each being equal in significance and representing mother earth. Then, the path leads to relations that are central for health. The mind and spirit then interact to define and experience place, or how an individual interprets his or world. Not only did UHN participants see land as central for their healing journey, but water was equally important for healing and change. Meanwhile, land and water were described as being perceived by the mind. The mind forms the sense of place, as influenced by one's spirit, during one's journey of health. The inner, imposed diamond of resilience is a common pattern in Houma culture as it represents the rattlesnake for most Muskogean/Houma peoples. The Houma word for rattlesnake is sant\u00e8 lo meaning sacred snake and symbolizes resilience and adaptation ( [Brown and Hardy 2000](#B8-genealogy-04-00091)); both of which were found important to a Houma view of health. This rattlesnake diamond holds the sacred mind, which interacts with the land/water and place and is dangerous as well as healing, like the rattlesnake. The diamond also contains the body, spirit, and relations that must be in balance with the mind for health to occur. The mind is counterbalanced with the body, both needing the other to exist and to maintain health in order to thrive. Then, the spirit and relations, or relationships and responsibilities to others across generations, are counterbalanced within the diamond of resilience. All of the diamond elements need to be in balance for healthy coping, supporting resilience, and overall health, which is centered within the diamond. 4. Discussion \"Walking. I am listening to a deeper way. Suddenly all my ancestors are behind me. Be still, they say. Watch and listen. You are the result of the love of thousands.\"\u2014Linda Hogan quote [Gustafson 2001](#B30-genealogy-04-00091)), we found that a land-based healing intervention can counteract settler colonial historical trauma responses and spur healthy behavioral changes. It also permitted for the therapeutic healing of trauma through reclaiming historic ceremonies and creating space for cultural continuity. Through this journey, UHN was able to develop their health framework (see [Figure 1](#genealogy-04-00091-f001)), which can be used in future studies to support resilience and thrivance. 4.1. Place and Creating Space [Baskin 2016](#B5-genealogy-04-00091)). Houma participants viewed the water and the land as their mother/relative. As seen in [Figure 1](#genealogy-04-00091-f001), land and water function as a physical location that holds cultural notions of place. This study reinforces that being on water and land creates meaningful relationships with Indigenous peoples and are critical in their journey to health. Our participants further felt spiritually and ancestrally connected to locations that their ancestors experienced sacred as well as traumatic events. In addition, our findings imply that place, like relatives, can serve to build relationships with others and a sense of community. Visiting place can further facilitate a stronger sense of Houma identity. [Saar and Palang 2009](#B59-genealogy-04-00091)). Yet after the participants physically reconnected with the land, these colonial sites and memories were replaced with even stronger Houma narratives of ancestral love. Though settler colonialism encourages silencing of the trauma and the dispossession, the land can continue to actively transmit both loss and life once a relationship is re-established ( [Tuck et al. 2014](#B65-genealogy-04-00091)). Through revisiting the land, the Houma women were able to assert agency, claim the space and pain of their ancestors, and create a Houma space to heal through ceremonies and reflections, supporting prior land-based research ( [Byrd 2011](#B11-genealogy-04-00091)). In alignment with non-Indigenous literature ( [Kearns and Moon 2002](#B42-genealogy-04-00091)), our findings reinforce that place, in terms of ancestral water and lands, matters for health and can serve as a strong facilitator for reflection and behavioral changes. Given Indigenous views of land and wellbeing, land can serve as an important context in which to conduct a culturally appropriate, health intervention. 4.2. Renewing Relationships with Ancestors (Aihalia Asanochi Taha) [Johnson-Jennings et al. 2020a](#B39-genealogy-04-00091)). Our findings support that by reconnecting with ancestral practices on the land and water, land can transmit and support Indigenous health behaviors ( [Dobson and Brazzoni 2016](#B24-genealogy-04-00091); [Parlee et al. 2005](#B54-genealogy-04-00091)). Therefore from an Indigenous view, land may be effective in inducing healthy behavioral changes through reconnection with the ancestors, but more research is needed to determine if long-term behavioral changes exist. 4.3. Spirituality/Mindfulness [Manzo 2005](#B47-genealogy-04-00091)). Land from an Indigenous lens is believed to hold a spiritual healing power that can assist during pain or other turmoil ( [Radu et al. 2014](#B56-genealogy-04-00091)). For instance, Houma women described healing from the trauma felt upon the land and waters by being mindful while reconnecting with land and/or through ceremony. Mindfulness, which has been described as awareness of internal and external realities ( [Creswell 2017](#B19-genealogy-04-00091)), has been found as a culturally appropriate and an effective approach among Indigenous communities ( [Dreger et al. 2014](#B25-genealogy-04-00091)). While mind-body interventions have been proposed to increase wellbeing and reduce disease ( [Kotecki et al. 2015](#B44-genealogy-04-00091); [Ryan et al. 2018](#B58-genealogy-04-00091)), little mindfulness research has been conducted among Indigenous groups. In our study, reconnecting to land, in particular, created the mental state to be present, or mindful, as found with other studies ( [Chinn 2014](#B17-genealogy-04-00091)). In this case, mindfulness was further triggered by being in nature, near water and animals. Most often this included reflecting on one's ancestral narratives of place, strength, and resilience; as well as self-reflection on health, behavioral choices, and considerations for becoming a good ancestor. Hence, water and land appear to induce a commitment to healthy behavior changes through contemplative practices. [Foley and Kistemann 2015](#B27-genealogy-04-00091)), water encouraged mindfulness and place-based healing ceremonies in our study. Participants connected to ancestors' and ancestral practices through the water and wished to conduct ceremony near water, which has been found an important place for healing ( [Foley and Kistemann 2015](#B27-genealogy-04-00091)). This finding aligns with other research that healthy blue space promotes healing through reducing stress and increasing physical activity ( [Foley and Kistemann 2015](#B27-genealogy-04-00091); [Wheeler et al. 2012](#B75-genealogy-04-00091)). Particularly from an Indigenous perspective, engaging in ceremony can induce mindfulness by encouraging an accepting attitude of all internal and external experiences ( [Dreger et al. 2014](#B25-genealogy-04-00091)). Thus, being on the land or water may actually be an ideal location to conduct mindful, contemplative practices, as opposed to an indoor location. Given Indigenous teachings often support non-judgemental awareness of one's surroundings, future research should consider the element of Indigenous mindfulness in land-based healing and how this could improve health. [McIvor et al. 2013](#B48-genealogy-04-00091)). Through experiencing the land and waters, the women increased their knowledge about their relationships to the plants, animals, and sky beings. Hence, being on the land/water can elicit the needs to identify, develop, and maintain a balance of relationships within the environment. Similarly, [Meyer](#B49-genealogy-04-00091)( [2014](#B49-genealogy-04-00091)) found that Native Hawaiians view the land as another ancestor and teacher, as \"we connect to her we connect to ourselves\" (101). Therefore, healing can be facilitated through being on the land and creating space. 4.4. Cultural Continuity [Auger 2016](#B4-genealogy-04-00091); [Newell et al. 2020](#B51-genealogy-04-00091)). It is further associated with lower prevalence of diabetes type 2 ( [Oster et al. 2014](#B52-genealogy-04-00091)). Cultural continuity has further been argued as a social determinant of health that influences proximal, intermediate, and distal health factors for Indigenous groups ( [Greenwood and Leeuw 2012](#B29-genealogy-04-00091)). Therefore, as seen within our study, reconnecting to ancestral lands and increasing cultural continuity may mitigate health risks for the UHN and other Indigenous groups. 4.5. Environment and Health [Corntassel and Hardbarger 2019](#B18-genealogy-04-00091)) but can also serve in a capacity to heal individuals and reinforce caretaking of the land in the face of climate change ( [Parlee et al. 2005](#B54-genealogy-04-00091); [Pearce et al. 2015](#B55-genealogy-04-00091)). A recent UHN dissertation study, conducted after this intervention, found that 97% of 152 UHN tribal citizens reported a strong connection to place ( [Billiot 2017](#B6-genealogy-04-00091)). Our findings indicated that this strong connection to place can guide healing the land. The Houma women developed an increased need to care and heal the earth for their own health. Many Houma stories exist regarding how to care for the soil and listen to the land, tend to it, and help mitigate hurricane risks. Furthermore, these stories may continue to guide Houma families' wellbeing and disaster preparedness, if they can be retold ( [Dardar 2008](#B23-genealogy-04-00091)). With climate change and environmental degradation, UHN's health risks have increased and many families have become isolated ( [UHN 2015](#B66-genealogy-04-00091)), leaving them without access to these ancestral narratives. Hence, land-based healing can provide space to share stories and facilitate reciprocal healing and environmental caretaking. [D'Oney 2008](#B22-genealogy-04-00091); [UHN 2015](#B66-genealogy-04-00091)). Furthermore, Houma participants who had exposure to environmental changes were recently found to have poorer reported health outcomes ( [Billiot 2017](#B6-genealogy-04-00091)). Thus, reconnecting to Houma ancestral land may be particularly important in buffering the effect of environmental changes. In fact, water/land-based healing and place can similarly be adapted to many other Indigenous and marginalized communities who are forced to relocate due to climate change, environmental changes, and exploitation. 4.6. Uma Hochokma Framework [Figure 1](#genealogy-04-00091-f001)). The Framework reflects the UHN participants process of initiating healthy behavioral changes and increased cultural practices. As found in other land-based research, land offers both a place and space in which relationships can be built for respect and love ( [Radu et al. 2014](#B56-genealogy-04-00091)). Our findings further bolster that Houma cultural notions of place are meaningful for health, as seen with other Indigenous groups ( [Dobson and Brazzoni 2016](#B24-genealogy-04-00091)). UHN relational place orientations included connecting to water and land for health and continuing one's health journey. The derived culturally grounded, Houma Health Umo Hochokma framework supports relationships and balance with land, place, and beings. Through engaging with mother earth, UHN participants were able to heal through the mind, body, spirit, and relationally. They were further able to reconnect with their ancestors, original instructions, culture, revitalize their spiritual practices, and increase their commitment to healthy behavioral changes. 5.
