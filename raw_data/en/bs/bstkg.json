Fresh and sea algae The algae Schizochytrium limacinum is a cultivated algae grown for the natural extraction of docosahexaenoic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid, which is found mainly in wild fish and marine algae. The spirulina algae from Burmese wild growth contains spirulan, a polysaccharide, which has been scientifically investigated by two German universities (Prof Dr Pulz, Dr. PJ Mewes (Health Forum for Orthomolecular Medicine, No. 2006/116). The algae are a high-quality component of this recipe. Coenzyme Q10 and polyphenols from fruits Coenzyme Q 10, also called ubiquinone, is structurally related to vitamin K and vitamin E. It is either formed by the body itself or is absorbed by the diet and is anchored in the cell membrane of the mitochondria. Coenzyme Q10 is involved as a coenzyme in the formation of ATP and is present in cells with a particularly high energy requirement (heart, liver, lung). This product contains 30 mg per capsule. Grape seeds contain oligomers of proanthocyanidins, which serve the plant as UV protection. The mango fruit contains xanthones. Xanthones are among the polyphenols.
