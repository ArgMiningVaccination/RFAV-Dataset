Typically, side effects are milder with the first dose versus second dose. Expect to feel more and often stronger, side effects after your second dose. These side effects may even affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Most side effects go away in 24-48 hours. Side effects do not necessarily mean you are having a bad reaction to your shot. They are also not a sign that you are allergic to any of the vaccine components. Some people have no side effects at all, while others may have somewhat severe side effects. People who had no side effects AND people who experienced more significant side effects BOTH developed good immunity to the virus in clinical trials. The current COVID-19 vaccines require two doses for them to best protect you. Get the second dose even if you have side effects after the first one, unless your doctor tells you not to. Some pain or fever-reducing medications can interfere with the immune response to vaccines, so it is advised not to take pain/fever reducing medicine BEFORE the vaccine. However, if you experience fever or pain AFTER the vaccine, take pain/fever reducing medicine per the over-the-counter instructions or advice from your personal physician. Important Reminder While the COVID-19 vaccine provides more protection than before the vaccine, you can still catch COVID-19, although you are likely to have a mild case. It is not known if you can still pass COVID-19 on to others. It is important to keep wearing your mask, continue hand hygiene, limit your contacts, and practice social distancing.Side Effects Timeline After Your Second Dose 1-12 hours: Arm may begin to be sore. Some people feel a bit tired and may get a headache. 2-24 hours: Possible fever, chills, and body aches. Don't worry, this doesn't last long. 24-48 hours: Most people will be back to normal or steadily improving. More than 48 hours: If you are still having symptoms, please stay home and contact your doctor for further evaluation. Also, please call the COVID-19 Hotline (312.227.5300). Work Versus Stay Home You may continue to work if you have mild side effects, feel well enough to do your job and do not have any COVID-19 signs or symptoms. COVID-19 signs and symptoms include cough, shortness of breath, runny nose, sore throat, loss of taste or smell. If you have any of these symptoms, please call the COVID-19 Hotline (312.227.5300) for testing. If you have a fever greater than 100.0 F and it goes away with fever- or pain-reducing medication, you may return to work. If fever persists, please call the COVID-19 Hotline.Common Side Effects of the COVID-19 Vaccine Local side effects at the site of injection Systemic (whole body) side effects Sore arm Pain at injection site Redness Swelling Fever Fatigue Headache Chills Muscle pain/body aches "}
