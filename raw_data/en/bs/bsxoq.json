Vaccine Distribution FAQs - How does vaccine distribution work? - The CDC primarily manages distribution of COVID-19 vaccine. Providers enrolled in the COVID-19 Vaccine Program can order vaccine through the Washington State Department of Health at any time or request vaccine supply from local vaccine depots. Vaccine orders and transfers are approved throughout the week. If vaccine doses are limited, the federal and state governments consider many factors such as prioritization of high-risk groups, vaccine supply and distribution, logistics, safety, and clinical guidance when deciding where to send vaccine shipments. This is called allocation. See the vaccine allocation section below for more details. Vaccine distribution adjusts over time depending on the number of available doses. When there is enough vaccine supply, we can fulfill orders as needed rather than using allocation. - Who are your partners in Washington state? - The Department of Health engages and coordinates with tribal nations, local government, community leaders, and other partners to develop and implement vaccination efforts. COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation and Prioritization Framework for Vaccine Allocation and Prioritization in WA Due to an initial limited supply of vaccine, we did not have enough to offer it to everyone. We had to make tough decisions about who would get the vaccine first. This is called vaccine allocation and prioritization. We developed Washington's framework for vaccine allocation and prioritization through an ongoing, robust public process. The framework balances federal guidance with the unique needs of our state and seeks to address health inequities that stem from historical injustices. Washington State COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation Guidance [Washington state's vaccine allocation and prioritization guidance (PDF)](/Portals/1/Documents/1600/coronavirus/820-112-InterimVaccineAllocationPrioritization.pdf) Updated March 24, 2021 - How do providers order vaccine for the next week? - Providers place vaccine orders in the state Immunization Information System (IIS). Ordering in the IIS is open seven days a week and the Department of Health approves orders on Mondays and Thursdays at noon (12 p.m.). If providers need extra vaccine between orders, they can request more from other providers in the IIS or from a vaccine depot.
