Czech J. Anim. Sci., 68: 1-16. Abstract: Nutraceuticals are food ingredients that provide extra health advantages that expand above their nutritional value. Nutraceuticals comprise amino acids, antioxidants, minerals, vitamins, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, enzymes, organic acids, fatty acids, medicinal plants, etc. Recently, nutraceuticals have acquired much attention in poultry industry by reason of their potential effects on establishing the normal physiological status, supporting the immune system, and disease prevention, which consequently enhances productivity. The technique of in ovo feeding (IOF) of nutraceuticals holds several promises in poultry industry. The vital benefits of IOF of nutraceuticals are enhancement of intestinal development, establishment of a balanced microbial population in the gut, support of intestinal physiology and health. Interestingly, IOF of nutraceuticals participates in improving the antioxidative properties and energizing the immune system, which thereby translated into greater performance and bigger resist - ance to diseases, especially in early life challenges. The current review attempts to throw more light on the fresh results associated with the profits of IOF of nutraceuticals on intestinal histomorphology, intestinal microbiota, antioxidative properties, immune responsiveness, hatchability, chick quality, and growth performance in poultry.

Nutraceuticals are food ingredients that provide extra health advan- tages that expand above their nutritional value. Recently, nutraceuticals have acquired much atten- tion in poultry industry by reason of their poten- tial impacts on establishing normal physiological status, supporting the immune system, and disease prevention, which consequently translated into en-hancing productivity. Nutraceuticals include amino acids, antioxidants, minerals, vitamins, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, enzymes, organic acids, fatty acids, medicinal plants, etc. (Alagawany et al. 2020). After banning the antibiotics as growth promot - ers, the world is looking forward to the natural alternatives of antibiotics because of the increas - ing demand for antibiotic-free and organic poul-try products. Amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and enzymes are already used as dietary supplements to maintain the normal physiological status, sup- port the immune response and enhance poultry productivity under thermo-neutral and heat stress conditions (Ebeid 2009, 2012; Saleh et al. 2019, 2020; Abdel-Moneim Khalifah prebiotics, synbiotics, and or - ganic acids might be promising alternatives to an-tibiotic growth promoters in poultry production because of their capability to maintain balanced microbial populations in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), establish intestinal integrity, and support the immune response in poultry ( Wei et al. 2022; Ebeid and Al-Homidan 2022). Also, phytogenic feed additives, such as herbs, medicinal plants, seeds, and their extracts, play a fundamental role in enhancing feed utilization and improving the an- tioxidative status in poultry (Saleh et al. 2018; Al- Homidan et al. 2020; Fathi et al. 2020). The technique of in ovo feeding (IOF) of nutraceu- ticals has attracted more attention because it holds several promises in enhancing the ability of newly hatched chicks to face challenges after hatching ( Figure 1 ). The IOF of nutraceuticals morphometry and modulated a healthy in-testinal microbial balance ( Asa et al. 2022 ; Gonzales et al. 2022 ; Shehata et al. 2022 ). Also, IOF of nutra- ceuticals participates in improving the antioxidative properties and stimulating the immune response, leading to high growth performance ( Yang et al. 2021 ; Dang et al. 2022 ; Mousstaaid et al. 2022 ) (Table 1 ). The current review attempts to throw more light on the fresh results associated with the profits Figure 1.

Features of in ovo technology Based on the published reports, the routes of IOF include amniotic fluid, allantoic membrane, air cell, yolk sac, and the embryo. Uni and Ferket (2004) sug- gested that the ideal time for IOF of nutrients into the amniotic fluid is the late phase of incubation, when the embryo consumes the amniotic fluid and the supplemental substances ingested directly with the amniotic fluid. The amniotic route is the optimal site in late stages of embryonic development and yolk sac in early stages of embryonic development. Application of IOF to late-stage embryos is safe coupled with no negative effects on hatchability but sometimes improved hatchability and chick qual- ity ( Nazem et al. 2017 ; Subramaniyan et al. 2019 ; Ajayi et al. 2022 ). Also, the site of IOF depends on the breed and embryonic development. Broiler eggs are usually injected into amniotic fluid or amniotic cavity on 17-18 days of incubation ( Ajayi et 2022 ; Shehata et al. 2022 ), while pigeon eggs are injected into the amniotic cavity on day 13 of incubation ( Zhu et al. 2019 ). Goose eggs are injected into the am- nion on 24 days of incubation ( Dang et al. 2022 ) and Japanese quail eggs are injected into the air sac on 15 days of incubation ( Hajati et al. 2021 ). Under commercial conditions, IOF is carried out during egg transfer from setter to hatcher machine (on 17-18 days of incubation) to provide the high requirements for nutrients, vitamins, and minerals needed for rapid embryonic development. The IOF of prebiotics and synbiotics might be injected into the air cell on 12.5 days of incubation ( Shehata et al. 2022 ), while probiotics might be injected into amni- otic on ( Oladokun et al. 2021 ). This might be involved in establishing beneficial bacteria in chicken GIT.

Dang et al. (2022) indicated that IOF of disac - charides (25 and 25 g/l sucrose) and/or methionine (5 g/l) elevated the relative weight jejunal jejunal histomorphology (villus height, width, and surface area) on 1, 7, and 28 days of age in geese. Several recent studies postulated that IOF of ami- no acids enhanced GIT development and health (Gao et al. 2018a , b; Elwan et al. 2019; Reicher et al. 2022). Gonzales et al. (2022) revealed that IOF of a combination of sulphur amino acids (5.90 mg of l-methionine and 3.40 mg of l-cysteine) plus 0.15 mg of folic acid increased the ileal crypt depth in neonatal chicks. Also, Ajayi et al. (2022) dem - onstrated that IOF of a blend of 3.4 mg cysteine + 2 mg lysine on day 17.5 of incubation improved intestinal morphology, including elevated duo - denal villus height, villus surface area, and villus height/crypt depth ratio. These results confirmed the previous studies, which showed that IOF of ly - sine enhanced the intestinal histomorphology in pigeons (Zhu et al. 2019). Reicher et al. (2022) confirmed that IOF of leucine and glutamine on day 17 of incubation increased the intestinal cell count by 33% and 40%, respectively, in compari- son with the control. Importantly, they explained that supplementation of glutamine and leucine via the in ovo route accelerated the development and maturity of small intestine throughout the pre-hatch phase by upregulating the proliferation and differentiation of multipotent cells. Moreover, Gao et al. (2018a) elucidated that IOF of 1% l-arginine on day 17.5 of embryonic development enhanced the development of digestive organs (proventricu- lus, gizzard, and pancreas), improved the duode- nal morphology (increased villus height, increased villus height/crypt depth ratio, and reduced crypt on day 7 of age in broilers. At the level of gene expression, Gao et al. (2018b) elucidated that IOF of 1% l-arginine on day 17.5 of embryonic development was involved in regulat - ing the intestinal barrier functions of post-hatch broilers via elevating the count of proliferating cell and utilize a diet rich in protein and carbohydrates (Uni and Ferket 2004). So, the prime objective of IOF is to accelerate the early GIT development and stimulate its capability to digest and absorb nutrients in the newly hatched chicks, and con- sequently supporting their fast-growth genes. Several reports confirmed that IOF of carbohy - drates (Berrocoso et al. 2017; Slawinska et al. 2020; Asa et al. 2022), amino acids (Nazem et al. 2019; Gonzales et al. 2022; Reicher et al. 2022), and pro- biotics (Abdel-Moneim et al. 2020a ; El-Moneim et al. 2020) improved the intestinal histomorphol-ogy. Earlier studies ( Tako et al. 2004; Smirnov et al. 2006) proved that IOF of carbohydrates (sucrose, maltose, and dextrin) with or without -hydroxy- -methylbutyrate (a leucine metabolite) on day 17 or day 17.5 of embryonic development enhanced embryonic GIT development in form of improv - ing the activities of digestive enzymes (sucrase-isomaltase and aminopeptidase) and enhancing the intestinal histomorphological parameters (e.g., higher villi, deeper crypts, higher villus/crypt depth ratio, and larger goblet cells). Furthermore, since goblet cells produce mucin, which inhibits danger - ous infections from adhering to the epithelial sur - face, they are utilized as a sign of intestinal health (Ebeid et al. 2021a). Smirnov et al. (2006) indicat - ed that IOF of carbohydrates activated the goblet cell proliferation and acidic mucin production. Similarly, the delivery of galactooligosaccharides via the in ovo route enhanced the intestinal health of chicks challenged with heat stress throughout the growing period (Slawinska et al. 2020). Asa et al. (2022) noted that IOF of 0.5 ml of carbohydrates and antioxidant mixture [maltose (25 Se (120 \u00b5g/ml), coenzyme Q10 mg/ml), tomycin (1 mg/ml)] improved the intestinal devel- opment in form of increasing the jejunum length and jejunum length/small intestine total length ratio. Moreover, they indicated that IOF of carbo- hydrates and antioxidant mixture elevated the villus length and decreased the crypt depth in the jeju- num of newly hatched chicks. Also, Nazem et al. (2019) elucidated that IOF of dextrose (10.0 and 20.0%) and amino acid mixture (10.0%) into the yolk sac on day 14 of embryonic development accelerated the embryonic intestinal development via enhancing the villus length, villus width, and 6 Review Czech Journal of Animal Science, 68, 2023 (1): 1-16 https://doi.org/10.17221/201/2022-CJAShistomorphology and immunity, improving the gut health of newly hatched chicks ( Berrocoso et al. 2017). Yang et al. (2021) indicated that the IOF of Astragalus polysaccharide (1, 2, and 4 mg) in - creased villus height and villus height/crypt depth ratio, while it reduced the crypt depth in intestinal segments at 7 and 21 days of age of broiler chickens. Interestingly, numerous studies explained that IOF of probiotics, prebiotics and/or synbiotics modu-lated the expression of intestinal function-related genes (mucin-2 and vascular endothelial growth fac - tor) et al. 2017; Shehata et al. 2022). Collectively, it is noteworthy to note that the IOF of nutraceuticals might be involved in improving GIT microarchitecture (villus-crypt units and goblet cells), enhancing the activities of digestive enzymes and consequently contribut - ing to an improvement in nutrient absorption and utilization. Impact of in ovo feeding of nutraceuticals on modulating gut microbiota Gut microbiota plays an essential role in the GIT function and health. Thus, modulating GIT micro - biota has been suggested as an effective strategy for boosting the host intestinal health, nutrient digestion, immunity, and productivity (Fathi et al. 2017, 2018; Ebeid et al. 2019). Unlike mammals, chicks hatch with a sterile GIT, and consequently, any contact with pathogenic bacteria poses a risk of infection and disease. The earlier colonization of GIT by useful bacteria supports birds in facing the environmental and pathogenic stressors (Abdel- Moneim et al. 2020b; El-Moneim et al. 2020). In ovo technology is a useful tool to establish the earlier colonization of beneficial microorganisms in the embryonic GIT. There is an extensive evidence il- lustrating that IOF of probiotics (Majidi-Mosleh et al. 2017; al. 2018; al. 2020), and (Boguslawska-Tryk et al. 2021; Shehata et al. 2022 ) helps to maintain a healthy microbial balance by strengthening the useful microorganisms like Lactobacillus, Bacillus, and Bifidobacterium and inhabiting the pathogenic bac - teria such as Salmonella, E. coli, and Clostridium nuclear antigen-positive cells of villus, and gene ex - pression of mucin-2, broilers. Bakyaraj et al. (2012) IOF of amino acids (serine, isoleucine and arginine) and trace elements (iron, iodine and zinc) improved mRNA expression of mucin. Regarding natural antioxidants, Araujo et al. (2019) noted that IOF of vitamin E (27.5, 38.5, 49.5, and 60.4 IU) on day 17.5 of incubation increased small intestine % and duodenal villus height. These results agree with Rajkumar et al. (2015), who ex - plained that IOF of vitamin E and glutamine helps in protecting the intestinal mucosa enterocytes, which consequently are involved in increasing cell proliferation and villus growth (Murakami et al. 2007). Furthermore, IOF of organic or inorganic Se on day 18 of incubation increased villus surface area and villus length and width in the duodenum and ileum (Krisnan et al. 2021). Several studies indicated that the IOF of pro- biotics, prebiotics and/or synbiotics had a posi- tive effect on GIT development (El-Moneim et al. 2020; Stadnicka et al. 2020; Boguslawska-Tryk et al. 2021; Shehata et al. 2022). Castaneda et al. (2021) concluded that IOF of Enterococcus faecium-based probiotic (1.4 \u00d7 10 7 CFU) on day 18 of incuba- tion resulted in the heavier and longer jejunum, ileum, and caecum. Moreover, Boguslawska-Tryk et al. prebi- and synbiotics villus villus area in jejunum and ileum, which indicated a positive effect on the absorption sur - face area. Also, Shehata et al. (2022) document - ed that IOF of Bacillus subtilis (4 \u00d7 10 5 and 4 \u00d7 106 CFU), raffinose (2 and 3 mg), or their combi- nations increased ileal villus height, villus surface area and muscular thickness. Oladokun et al. (2021) confirmed that IOF of B. subtilis (10 \u00d7 10 6 CFU) on day 18.5 of incubation had a positive effect on intestinal morphometric characteristics, includ- ing villus height (18 -23% higher), villus width (8% wider), and total mucosa thickness (28% greater) in jejunum and ileum giving a good indicator of the gut health and function. El-Moneim et al. (2020) observed that IOF of different kinds of probiot - ics (Bifidobacterium bifidum and Bifidobacterium and villus height/crypt depth ratio and reduced the crypt depth. Additionally, IOF of raffinose (1.5 -4.5 mg/egg) enhanced ileum 7 Review Czech Journal of Animal Science, 68, 2023 (1): 1-16 https://doi.org/10.17221/201/2022-CJASin GIT. Castaneda et al. (2021) detected that IOF of B. subtilis (106 CFU/50 \u00b5l/ egg) on day 18 of incu- bation reduced pathogenic bacteria, including total aerobic bacterial counts and total coliforms in il- eum and caecum on different days of the growth pe- riod of broilers. Also, Abdel-Moneim et al. (2020a) demonstrated that IOF of Bifidobacteria decreased total coliforms and total bacterial counts and en- hanced Bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacterial counts in ileum. It was confirmed that IOF of pro-biotics decreased Salmonella colonization in caeca (de Oliveira et al. 2014; Teague et al. 2017). Teague et al. (2017) IOF of commercial pro- biotic FloraMax \u00ae-B11 (lactic acid bacteria) reduced Salmonella enteritidis infection in broilers. These results agree with de Oliveira et al. (2014), who pos - tulated that IOF of E. faecium reduced S. enteritidis challenges. This reduction of pathogenic bacteria might be attributed to the formation of short-chain fatty acids and antimicrobial peptides and bacteri- ocins, beneficial bacteria (Majidi- Mosleh et al. 2017; Ebeid et al. 2021a). The IOF of prebiotics had positive health prof - its in the host. Tavaniello et al. (2018) eluci-dated that IOF of raffinose motivated the early development of useful bacteria (Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria) and suppressed pathogenic bacteria colonization in GIT. Similarly, Pacifici et al. (2017) and Stadnicka et al. (2020) illustrated that IOF of raffinose improved the gut health by decreas - ing the intestinal populations of Clostridia, E. coli, and coccidia counts and elevating the populations of Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli. Likewise, Zhang et al. (2020) documented that IOF of chitooligo- saccharide (5 mg) and chlorella polysaccharide (5 mg) on day 12.5 of incubation modulated cae- cal microbial community. The polysaccharide- utilizing and B. salanitronis were higher than those in control groups, while opportunistic patho- gens boydii lower than in the control. Shehata et al. (2022) documented that IOF of synbiotics (B. subtilis plus raffinose) increased caecal communities of B. subtilis and lactic acid bacteria, and reduced E. coli , Enterococcus spp., total coliforms, and total bacterial count. These findings are in correspondence with Dunislawska et al. (2017), who reported that delivery of synbiot - ics (L. salivarius plus galactooligosaccharides and L. plantarum plus raffinose) via the in ovo route enhanced the populations of Lactobacillus spp. and Enterococcus spp. in ileum. Importantly, Shehata et al. (2022) documented that IOF of probiotics, prebiotics and/or synbiotics increased caecal con- tents butyric, pentanoic, is - ovaleric, and isobutyric acids. These findings are in accordance with Boguslawska-Tryk et al. (2021). Also, Oladokun et al. (2021) reported that IOF of B. subtilis increased caecal concentrations of short-chain fatty acids in broilers. Also, raffinose plays a crucial role in accelerating Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria fermentation and producing short-chain fatty acids that suppress the growth and proliferation of pathogens (Berrocoso et al. 2017). These organic acids lowered the intestinal pH and consequently played vital roles in suppress - ing GIT pathogens, supporting structural integrity, enhancing the barrier function of gut epithelia, physiological function, intestinal immunity and health (Ebeid and Al-Homidan 2022). Therefore, the earlier establishment of beneficial bacteria in chicken GIT can block pathogen colonization, enhancing GIT development and health, which fi- nally translated into higher performance. Impact of in ovo feeding of nutraceuticals on antioxidative status Avian embryos are more sensitive to oxidative stress because of their extremely quick develop- ment, high metabolic rates, and high polyun- saturated fatty acid content in tissues. Therefore, activating the antioxidant defence system will pro- tect the embryo against reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( Deeming and Pike 2013 ). Surai et al. (2016) documented that the antioxidant system of devel-oping embryo consists of antioxidant (Se, Mn, Zn, etc.). The IOF of natural antioxidants enhances the activity of antioxi-dative enzymes, which play a fundamental role in scavenging and detoxification of ROS and also 8 Review Czech Journal of Animal Science, 68, 2023 (1): 1-16 https://doi.org/10.17221/201/2022-CJASdecreasing the malondialdehyde peroxidation al. 2022 ; Mousstaaid et al. 2022 ). Araujo et al. (2019) demonstrated that IOF of vitamin E (27.5, 38.5, 49.5, and 60.4 IU) on day 17.5 of incubation en- hanced hepatic CAT activity of new-born chicks. Kalantar et al. (2019) noted that IOF of coenzyme Q10 (0.1 and 0.2 ml) on day 18 of incubation in- creased serum activities of CAT and SOD at 1 -21 and 22 -42 days of age in broilers. Moreover, IOF of a mixture of carbohydrates and antioxidants increased concentrations of CAT, SOD and total antioxidant capacity and decreased MDA con- centration in the liver of neonatal chicks ( Asa et al. 2022 ). Likewise, Oke et al. (2021) indicated that IOF of Nigella sativa extract (6 mg) increased plasma SOD and decreased plasma MDA concen- trations of newly hatched chicks thermally chal- lenged during incubation and also at marketing age (56 days). Also, Hajati et al. (2021) indicated that IOF of Spirulina platensis (2.5 or 3.5 mg) in- creased liver CAT activity and gene expression of hepatic GSH-Px and reduced liver MDA con- centration in quail hatchlings. It is widely known that IOF of l-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) at different levels enhanced the anti-oxidative properties and minimized lipid peroxi- dation (El-Senousey et al. Zhang et al. 2019; Mousstaaid et al. 2022). El-Senousey et al. (2018) reported that IOF of ascorbic acid (3 mg/egg) on day 18 of incubation elevated plasma GSH-Px and total antioxidant capacity concentrations and decreased MDA plasma concentration in post-hatched chicks. Mousstaaid et al. (2022) documented that IOF of 12 or 25 mg of l-ascorbic acid on day 18 of embryonic development increased serum concentrations of l-ascorbic acid and SOD and lowered serum MDA concentration. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2019) indi- cated that IOF of l-ascorbic acid (12 mg) increased plasma SOD and decreased MDA concentrations in 42-day-old broilers. Numerous studies proved that IOF of antioxi- dant minerals, including Se (El-Deep et al. 2020; Krisnan 2021), Mn (Geng et al. 2022), Zn (Shokraneh et al. 2020) improved the antioxida- tive status and reduced lipid peroxidation. El-Deep et al. (2020) demonstrated that IOF of 10, 20, or 30 g of nano-Se on day 18 of embryonic develop-ment enhanced serum concentrations of total an- tioxidant capacity, GSH-Px, SOD, and CAT. These results are in correspondence with Ibrahim et al. (2020), who showed that IOF of 10 ppb of nano-Se on day 18 of incubation increased serum con- centrations of glutathione reductase and reduced MDA concentration at 35 days of broiler age. Also, Krisnan et al. (2021) indicated that IOF of 0.15 ppm of organic or inorganic Se on 18 day of incuba- tion elevated serum GSH-Px activity at 18 days of chicken age. Moreover, Geng et al. (2022) noted that delivery of Mn (6.25, 12.5, 25.0, or 50.0 g) via the in ovo route elevated SOD mRNA expres - sion in the embryonic heart and might alleviate oxidative stress. Furthermore, Shokraneh et al. (2020) showed that IOF of 500 \u00b5g nano-Zn on day 17 of embryonic development increased serum ac - tivities of GSH-Px and SOD. It was reported that amino acids have a greater antioxidant capacity via keeping a balance between producing and removing free radicals. Elnesr et al. (2019) revealed that IOF of sulphur amino acids (5.90 mg of l-methionine + 3.40 mg of l-cysteine) on day 17.5 of incubation enhanced the activities of GSH-Px, SOD, and CAT as well as it increased GSH-Px gene expression in serum, liver, jejunum, cardiac muscle, and pectoral muscle. These results are in correspondence with those of Elwan et al. (2019), who indicated that IOF of 5.90 mg l-me- thionine + 3.40 mg l-cysteine on day 17.5 of em-bryonic development increased the concentrations of total antioxidant capacity and glutathione in se- rum, liver, heart, kidney, pectoral muscle, and small intestine of newly hatched chicks subjected to hy - perthermia during incubation. Recently, Dang et al. (2022) proved that IOF of methionine (5 g/l) jejunal GSH and GSH-Px concentrations at seven and 28 days of age in geese. Han et al. (2022) postulated that IOF of mol) and decreased serum MDA concentrations of broilers at 39 days of age. Also, Ajayi et al. (2022) demonstrated that IOF of a mixture of 3.4 mg cysteine + 2 mg lysine on day 17.5 of incubation increased serum SOD and decreased serum MDA concentrations of day- old chicks. Additionally, Lu et al. (2022) proved that IOF of 1% l-arginine on day 18 of incubation increased total antioxidant capacity and reduced MDA content of breast muscle at 21 days of age. It could be summarized that IOF of nutraceuti- cals might alleviate oxidative stress and improve the antioxidative status of developing embryos and post-hatch chicks.9 Review Czech Journal of Animal Science, 68, 2023 (1): 1-16 https://doi.org/10.17221/201/2022-CJASImpact of in ovo feeding of nutraceuticals on immune response Modern broilers have become more sensitive to infectious diseases due to their high growth rate. Therefore, much attention was paid to im- proving the immune system and activating the im- mune response in the early growth stages. The IOF of nutraceuticals, immune stimulants, and bioac - tive components might be a promising tool to en- hance the post-hatch immune response in poultry and grant protection against diseases ( Salary et al. 2014 ; Subramaniyan et al. 2019 ; Yang et al. 2021 ; Shehata et al. 2022 ). It is well documented that IOF of natural antioxidants can enhance embryonic and post-hatch immunity and development at the early age. Bakyaraj et al. (2012) indicated that IOF of vitamin mixture (200 IU vitamin A, 20 IU vi- tamin D 3, 1 IU vitamin E, 72 g thiamine, 144 g riboflavin, 140 g pyridoxine, 400 g pantothenic acid, 140 g niacin, and 8 mg vitamin C) or trace element mixture (0.3 g Se, 80 g Zn, 160 g Fe, 0.7 g I, 16 g Cu, and 120 mg Mn) improved humoral immune response (antibody titre against sheep red blood cells SRBCs) and cell-mediated immunity (foot web thickness) at 21 days of age in broiler chickens. Salary et al. (2014) reported that IOF of 33.0 IU vitamin E increased serum antibody titres of avian influenza, infectious bron- chitis, and Newcastle disease as well as it elevated serum values of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) at 21 days of age of broilers. Additionally, Kalantar et al. (2019) noted that IOF of coenzyme Q10 (0.1 and 0.2 ml) on day 18 of incubation in- creased the weight of lymphoid organs (bursa of Fabricius and spleen) and serum antibody titres against Newcastle disease, infectious bronchitis disease, and avian influenza at 28 and 42 days of age in broilers. Hajati et al. (2021) indicated that IOF of Spirulina platensis (1.5, 2.5 or 3.5 mg) increased liver interferon- (IFN-) gene expres - sion. Moreover, Li et al. (2016) demonstrated that IOF of 100 and 150 \u00b5g folic acid elevated plasma lysozyme activity and plasma concentra- tions of IgG and IgM in broiler chickens. They also elucidated that IOF of 100 and 150 \u00b5g folic acid upregulated gene expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-4 and downregulated IL-6 gene ex - pression, which indicated an improvement in the correlation between immunity and epigenetic regulation of cytokine genes.The IOF of trace elements has gained extra at - tention due to their multiple physiological roles, such as activating several vital enzymes, promot - ing immunity, and alleviating the oxidative stress. Krisnan et al. (2021) indicated that IOF of 0.15 ppm of organic or inorganic Se on day 18 of incuba- tion improved the antibody titre against Newcastle disease virus and lymphocyte and heterophil per - centages. These results are consistent with Ibrahim et al. (2020), who illustrated that IOF of 10 ppb of nano-Se on day 18 of incubation increased se- rum concentrations of IgM, IgG, and total immu- noglobulins and antibody titre against Newcastle disease virus. Goel et al. (2016) noted that IOF of trace elements (500 g Zn, 17.5 g I, or 1.5 g Se) on day 14 of incubation improved humoral and cell-mediated immunity via increasing the cytokine (IL-2, IL-12, and TNF-) in post-hatch broiler chickens. Bakyaraj et al. (2012) indicated that IOF of ami- no acid mixture (10 mg methionine, 16 mg threo-nine, 25 mg arginine, 12.5 mg glycine, 12.5 mg serine, and 18 mg valine) improved the antibody titre against SRBCs and cell-mediated immunity at 21 days of age in broiler chickens. In another study, Toghyani et al. (2019) reported that IOF of arginine (35 mg) and/or threonine (25 mg) on day 14 of incubation increased the antibody ti- tre against SRBCs significantly, while antibody titres against Newcastle disease and avian influ- enza were not increased significantly. Moreover, IOF of arginine significantly increased the rela- tive weights of the bursa of Fabricius and spleen in comparison with the sham control at 11 days of age in broilers. Similarly, Gonzales et al. (2022) revealed that IOF with a combination of sulphur amino acids (5.90 mg of l-methionine and 3.40 mg of l-cysteine) plus 0.150 mg of folic acid in- creased the relative weights of thymus and spleen at 21 days of age. Moreover, it was demonstrated that IOF of 100 g l-arginine (Subramaniyan et al. 2019) or 100 g l-arginine conjugated with 1 000 \u00b5g silver nanoparticles (Subramaniyan et al. 2020) on day 14 of incubation increased the se- rum concentration of IgM in newly hatched chicks. In the same line, Kermanshahi et al. (2017) stated that IOF of 0.5 mg threonine on day 11 of embryo - genesis upregulated IgA mRNA in the new-born chicks of Japanese quail. Probiotics can stimulate both specific and non- specific immune responses by encouraging mac -10 Review Czech Journal of Animal Science, 68, 2023 (1): 1-16 https://doi.org/10.17221/201/2022-CJASrophages, boosting cytokine production, and increasing IgA, IgM concentrations ( Fathi et al. 2017; Ebeid et al. 2021a The IOF of pro- biotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics is a promising tool for the earlier establishment of useful bacteria in GIT and consequently it stimulates the intes - tinal innate (nonspecific) immunity and adap-tive (specific) immune response. Alizadeh et al. (2021) noted that IOF of 1 \u00d7 10 7 CFU Lactobacilli at embryonic day 18 antibody titre against SRBCs and keyhole limpet haemocyanin, elevated the proportion of CD4+ and CD4+CD25+ T cells in spleen and upregulated gene expression of interferon (IFN)-, IFN-, IL-8, IL-13, and al. postulated of L. casei, and and caecal tonsils, which participate in regulating the innate and adaptive immune responsiveness. Moreover, Yang et al. (2021) indicated that IOF of Astragalus polysac - charide (1 mg, 2 mg, and 4 mg) on day 18 of incu- bation enhanced the intestinal mucosal immunity in form of increasing the number of IgA + cells in mucosa and the secretory IgA concentrations in intestinal washings, which consequently sup- port the first barrier against pathogen invasion. Moreover, levels of relative mRNA expression of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-, and Toll-like receptor-4 were elevated due to IOF of Astragalus polysaccharide. Furthermore, Shehata et al. (2022) documented that IOF of B. subtilis (4 \u00d7 10 5 and 4 \u00d7 106 CFU), raffinose (2 and 3 mg), or their in-creased ileal mRNA expression of IL-2 and toll-like receptor-4. These results are consistent with those of Dunislawska et al. (2017), who documented that IOF of synbiotics (L. salivarius + galactooligo-saccharides and L. plantarum + of IL6, IL18, IL1-, IFN-, and IFN- in spleen on day 21 of age and it also resulted in a significant downregulation of IL- 12, IL-8, and IL-1 on day 42 and IFN- in caecal tonsils on day 14 of age. Collectively and by tak - ing into consideration the antioxidative properties of nutraceuticals, IOF of nutraceuticals can moti- vate the humoral and cell-mediated immunity via regulating the gene expression of cytokines. Impact of in ovo feeding of nutraceuticals on hatchability and chick quality Several studies elucidated that IOF of amino acids improved hatchability and chick quality ( Nazem et al. 2017 ; Subramaniyan et al. 2019 ; Ajayi et al. 2022 ). Bakyaraj et al. (2012) indicated that IOF of amino acid mixture enhanced hatchability per fertile egg set, chick weight and chick weight/egg weight ratio. Another study by Nazem et al. (2017) also noted that IOF of methionine elevated the weight at hatch, which might be attributed to the enhanced antioxi- dant status in embryos. Ajayi et al. (2022) demon- strated that IOF of a mixture of 3.4 mg cysteine + 2 mg lysine on day 17.5 of incubation improved hatchabil - ity and chick quality traits (scores of eyes, legs, na-vel area, appearance, activity, remaining membrane, and remaining yolk). Similarly, Subramaniyan et al. (2019) demonstrated that IOF of l-arginine (100 g) on day 14 of incubation improved hatchability, sur - vival rate, and body weight of newly hatched chicks. These improvements might be attributed to the fact that embryos may use the in ovo delivered amino acids to improve the energy status and build mus - cle protein, which finally translated into improving hatchability, chick quality, and survival rate. Several recent publications documented the pos - itive effect of IOF of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals on hatchability and chick quality char - acteristics ( El-Deep et al. 2020 ; Hajati et al. 2021 ; Geng et al. 2022 ). Asa et al. (2022) observed that IOF of a mixture of antioxidants and carbohydrates improved hatching %, chick weight, chick quality characteristics, appearance and eye condition, and activity of new-born chicks. Araujo et al. (2019) noted that IOF of 60.4 IU vitamin E improved hatchability %, shortened the hatch window, and enhanced chick physical quality parameters (new- born chick quality score, body weight, length, and chick weight/egg weight ratio). El-Senousey et al. (2018) proved that IOF of ascorbic acid (3 mg/egg) increased chick weight and chick weight/egg weight ratio. Kalantar et al. (2019) noted that IOF of coen- zyme Q10 (0.1 and 0.2 ml) on day 18 of incubation increased the hatching rate and body weight of new - ly hatched chicks and this improvement might be associated with the enhancement of the antioxidant status, which grants protection against the oxidative stress. Bakyaraj et al. (2012) indicated that IOF of vi- tamin mixture or trace element mixture enhanced hatchability per fertile egg set, chick weight and 11 Review Czech Journal of Animal Science, 68, 2023 (1): 1-16 https://doi.org/10.17221/201/2022-CJASchick weight/egg weight ratio. In addition, Hajati et al. (2021) indicated that IOF of Spirulina platensis (1.5, 2.5 or 3.5 mg) increased hatchability and weight of newly hatched quail chicks. Li et al. (2016) dem- onstrated that IOF of 100 and 150 \u00b5g folic acid en-hanced hatchability. El-Deep et al. (2020) illustrated that IOF of 10, 20, or 30 g of nano-Se on day 18 of incubation enhanced hatchability. Furthermore, Geng et al. (2022) noted that IOF of 25.0 g Mn enhanced hatchability, but embryonic mortality and hatched chick weight were not significantly affected. It might be mentioned that the IOF of exogenous antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals reduces free radical production and enhances lipid utilization for getting the energy needed for hatching. On the other side, several studies reported that IOF of probiotics ( Pender et al. 2017 ; Teague et al. 2017 ; Alizadeh et al. 2021 ; Castaneda et al. 2021 ), prebiot - ics (Stadnicka et al. 2020 al. 2021 syn- biotics ( Dunislawska had no significant effect on hatchability and chick quality. Studies re-ported that IOF of Lactobacilli ( Alizadeh et al. E. faecium 2014 Pediococcus acidilactici, B. 2017 ) did not affect hatchabil- ity, embryonic mortality (early, mid, and late death), pipped, contaminated, and culled embryos and chick weight. Also, IOF of raffinose ( Stadnicka et al. 2020 Yang et al. 2021 ) had no significant influence on hatchability. Likewise, Dunislawska et al. (2017) reported that IOF of syn- biotics (L. salivarius + galactooligosaccharides and L. plantarum + raffinose) had no negative effect on hatchability. Likewise, several studies elucidated that IOF of nutraceuticals, including Se ( Hassan 2018 ; Krisnan et al. 2021 ), vitamin E ( Salary et al. 2014 ; Rajkumar et al. 3.40 mg l-cysteine ( Elwan et al. 2019 ) had no negative effects on hatchability, hatching weight and quality of new-born chicks. It might be reported that if the IOF of nutraceuticals does not improve the hatching traits, it will not harm them. Impact of in ovo feeding of nutraceuticals on growth performance Increasing live body weight (BW) and body weight gain (BWG) that are directly related to the increase in average daily feed intake (ADFI) and the improvement in feed conversion ratio (FCR) serve as indicators of improvements in growth performance. The majority of studies elucidat - ed that IOF of nutraceuticals enhanced growth performance. Several publications documented that IOF of a mixture of carbohydrates and an- tioxidants ( Asa et al. 2022 ), Se ( Hassan 2018 ; El- Deep Krisnan et al. (Oke et al. 2021), and folic acid (Li et al. 2016) improved growth performance measurements. Additionally, a series of recent studies have indi- cated that IOF of amino acids enhanced growth performance ( Yu et al. 2018; Toghyani et al. 2019; Ajayi et al. 2022; Dang et al. 2022; Gonzales et al. 2022). Ajayi et al. (2022) demonstrated that IOF of a mixture of 3.4 mg cysteine + 2 mg lysine on day 17.5 of embryogenesis enhanced post-hatch growth performance. Similarly, Toghyani et al. (2019) postulated that IOF of l-arginine (35 mg) and/or threonine (25 mg) on day 14 of incubation increased BW, BWG, and ADFI. Zhu et al. (2019) documented that IOF of l-lysine (2.11 mg) in- creased BW and BWG of squabs at 14 days of age. Also, Dang et al. (2022) proved that IOF of methio - nine (5 g/l) and/or disaccharides (25 g/l maltose and 25 g/l sucrose) increased breast muscle %, breast muscle glycogen content and diameter of myofibres at hatching in geese. They also illustrated that IOF of methionine upregulated the expression of mus - cle fibre development genes, including myogenic factor-5 and myostatin, at 1, 7, and 28 days of age in geese. The IOF of amino acids or peptides in- creases the pectoral muscle mass via the expression of muscle development genes. It was documented that the expression of myogenin and MyoD was sig - nificantly upregulated by IOF of l-arginine (100 g) on day 14 of incubation (Subramaniyan et al. 2019). Likewise, Subramaniyan et al. (2020) confirmed that IOF of l-arginine conjugated with silver na- noparticles (100 g with 1 000 \u00b5g, respectively) on day 14 of incubation upregulated the protein expression of muscle development markers (myo- genin and myoD ). Also, Gonzales et tected that IOF of 0.150 mg folic acid increased the expression of the Pax7 and Myf genes involved in satellite cell proliferation in the pectoralis mus - cle of hatched chicks. Moreover, Yu et al. (2018) postulated that IOF of 1.0% l- arginine enhanced energy reserves of liver, pectoral muscle, and serum 12 Review Czech Journal of Animal Science, 68, 2023 (1): 1-16 https://doi.org/10.17221/201/2022-CJASthyroid hormone concentrations. Furthermore, Gao et al. (2018a) demonstrated that IOF of 1% arginine improved digestive enzyme activities, which finally translated into enhancing the post- hatch growth performance of broilers. It might be reported that IOF of nutraceuticals upregulated the protein expression of muscle development and also it increased muscle glycogen (energy) stores, which promote myofibre maturation, leading to en- hancement of the muscle size. The IOF of probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics positively impacted on GIT development and its physiological function. Several authors have recog- nized that IOF of probiotics (El-Moneim al. 2021), et al. 2018; Yang et synbiotics (Shehata et al. 2022) enhanced post-hatch growth perfor - mance traits. These supplements may play a part in improving the health condition of GIT by boost - ing the colonization of beneficial bacteria, reducing the colonization of pathogenic bacteria, promoting intestinal morphology, increasing activities of di-gestive enzymes, and enhancing feed digestibility and utilization (Abdel-Moneim et al. 2020a ; El- Moneim et al. 2020; Ebeid et al. 2021a , b). On the other side, IOF of nutraceuticals does not always grant a positive impact on growth perfor - mance in poultry. It was observed that IOF of B. sub - tilis (Oladokun et al. 2021), B. subtilis, sali-varius + and L. plantarum + raffinose (Dunislawska et BW, BWG, ADFI, FCR, and mor - tality throughout the growing period. Also, Han et al. (2022) postulated that IOF of l-leucine had no significant influence on BWG and relative weights of liver, heart and bursa of Fabricius; however, it improved the relative weight of spleen in broilers at 39 days of age. Similarly, Geng et al. (2022) noted that IOF of 25.0 g Mn did not affect BWG, ADFI, FCR, mortality, dressing %, breast muscle %, thigh muscle %, abdominal fat %, pH and colour of breast and thigh meats. Conclusion Based on the recent findings, it could be con- cluded that IOF of nutraceuticals might be a promising tool to enhance poultry productivity under thermo-neutral and heat stress conditions. The vital benefits of IOF of nutraceuticals are en- hancement of intestinal development, establish- ment of the healthy intestinal microbial balance, and support of the intestinal function and health. Interestingly, IOF of nutraceuticals participates in enhancing the antioxidative properties and ac - tivating the immune system, which thereby trans - lated into high performance and bigger resistance to diseases. Indeed, obtaining such advantages is essential in the commercial poultry industry, espe- cially for antibiotic-free poultry production.
