The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ap - proved the device in March. Through a small incision in the groin, interventional neuroradiologists thread a small catheter device into the arteries in the brain, re - moving blood clots, rapidly restoring blood flow and reviving neurological tissues. According to Gary Spiegel, M.D., the hospital's director of neurointerventional surgery, the device could be the first major breakthrough in treating stroke since the Stroke Center pioneered the development of the revolutionary MERCI re - trieval device to capture a clot in 2001. \"I think now we're at the point where we can open vessels nearly all the time,\" says Dr. Spiegel. \"This clearly is a significant advance.\" Epilepsy Center Scheduled for Fall Launch Hartford Hospital's multidisciplinary Neuroscience Center provides surgery and medical treatment for patients who have been diagnosed with epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. A new six- bed Epilepsy Center, scheduled to open in the fall, will offer advanced technolo - gies and state-of-the art epilepsy treatment. The hospital is seeking Level-IV status, the highest designation given by the National Association of Epilepsy Centers (NAEC). The hospital has also partnered with the Connecticut Epilepsy Foundation to establish an epilepsy support group at the hospital, the only sup - port group specifically for epilepsy patients in the region. 2For a woman hoping to get pregnant and deliver a healthy baby, obesity and excess weight gain can cause serious complications. The hormonal changes caused by obesity may interfere with fertility and delay conception. Excessive weight gain before and during pregnancy raises the chances of having a large baby, po - tentially increasing the need for a Cesarian section with its associated risks. Excess weight gain can affect the functioning of the pancreas and lead to Type 2 diabetes. For the safety of the mother and the baby, blood sugar levels must be closely monitored and maintained at normal levels. \"Good blood sugar control is very important even before conception,\" says perinatologist (prenatal special - ist) Adam Borgida, M.D. \"We follow women with diabetes closely because they are at three to six times greater risk for complications during pregnancy. About 30 percent of pregnant women with diabetes have preeclampsia, which can cause swelling, weight gain and dangerously high blood pressure during the second or third trimester.\" Studies suggest that closely monitoring weight gain in overweight and obese women during pregnancy is vi - tal to a safe pregnancy and delivery. \"We ask obese wom - en not to gain more than about 10-20 pounds (or 15-25 pounds if a woman is overweight) during pregnancy to prevent the risk of developing gestational [during preg - nancy] diabetes,\" says perinatologist Deborah Feldman, M.D. \"Encouraging a healthy weight can increase the chances of having a baby of normal size.\" Giving birth to an extremely large infant is risky for both mother and child. \"Women with high blood sugar levels during pregnancy are at risk for having a baby that is so big that the shoulders can't pass through the birth canal,\" says Dr. Borgida. \"Shoulder 'dystocia' is an obstet - rical emergency.\" Doctors now use a lower threshold for diagnosing gestational diabetes, which can bring earlier diagnosis and treatment to mothers at risk. \"Older women who are obese often find that their type 2 diabetes becomes more out of control as their pregnancy progresses,\" says Dr. Borgida. Specialists from Hartford Hospital's Diabetes LifeCare program partner with high-risk obstetricians to help pregnant women limit weight gain and avoid complica - tions. Children of women who develop gestational dia - betes are at risk for diabetes and obesity as they grow up. \"Women who control their blood sugar with oral medica - tions or insulin are followed closely during pregnancy,\" says Dr. Feldman. \"The good news is that women with diabetes can deliver healthy babies.\" Pregnancy Risks in Overweight or Obese WomenWeighty Matters 3Dr. Adam Borgida works with women at risk for a chromosomal disorder.Worry-Free Pregnancy A New Non-Invasive Test for Genetic Defects American women may look and feel younger than their mothers did at 35 or 40, but they still haven't figured out how to stop the biological clock from ticking. When Jennifer (not her real name) was in her 20s, she and her husband lived in Spain for a while, thinking they had all the time in the world to have children. They were thrilled when she became pregnant with her first child at 34, but hope turned to tragedy when the fetus was found to have a chromo - somal abnormality that was \"incompatible with life.\" Jennifer endured multiple miscarriages over the next few years before giving birth to a stillborn baby. Pregnant again and nearing 40, she and her husband had to make a wrenching decision: whether to undergo invasive testing that carried a small risk of causing another miscarriage. Prenatal Testing When a woman at risk for a chromosomal disorder finds out she's preg - nant, her joy is often tinged with fear. Nine months is a long time to wait. Until now, pregnant women often didn't want to chance the small risk of miscarriage that goes along with invasive prenatal tests. A new blood test can now alert couples to chromosomal abnormalities ear - ly in pregnancy. The test measures cell-free fetal DNA in the mother's blood. Testing is available for women at high risk for a baby with Down's Syndrome. The blood test complements existing screening blood tests for spina bifida and neural tube defects, among other disorders. The Maternal-Fetal Medicine Division of Women's Health Services at Hartford Hospital offers the test to all women at increased risk for chromo - somal abnormalities. The risk of having a child with an extra chromosome (trisomy) or other abnormality rises sharply with advanced maternal age (older than 35 years) or a previous child with abnormalities. \"The blood test analyzes circulating DNA in the mother's bloodstream,\" says perinatologist (prenatal specialist) Adam Borgida, M.D. \"It can detect an abnormality as early as 10 weeks.\" Advanced Maternal Age Every woman is born with all the eggs she's ever going to have, which means that a 35-year-old woman who waits to have children is hostage to her aging ovaries. At age 20, the chance of having a Down syndrome baby is about one in 1,500, but by age 40 the risk soars to one in 85. The number of U.S. babies born with Down syndrome has risen by nearly a third over the last three decades, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Down syndrome occurs five times more often in pregnancies of mothers older than age 35. Older women are at risk for potentially dangerous pregnancy-related conditions like toxemia or preeclampsia (high blood pressure) that affect both the mother and her unborn child. Ultrasound may provide some clues, but does not offer all the information necessary to be assured of a healthy baby. Hartford Hospital provides diagnostic testing and prenatal screening for genetic disorders, as well as specialized care for high-risk pregnancies. 5PHYSICIAN PROFILE Deborah Feldman, M.D. Deborah Feldman, M.D., is a perinatologist in the maternal-fetal medicine area of Women's Health Services at Hartford Hospital. Perinatology is a demanding field that requires an additional seven years of advanced study after medi - cal school. Dr. Feldman, who is board-certi - fied in both maternal-fetal medicine and obstetrics and gynecology, specializes in high-risk pregnan - cies, providing prenatal testing and medical care for both the mother and the unborn child. She has specialized training and clinical ex - perience in first-trimester screening and high-risk obstetrics. She earned her undergraduate degree at Mount Holyoke College and her medical degree from the University of Connecticut in 1994. She completed her fellowship training in maternal-fetal medicine at the University of Connecticut Health Center in 2001. An associate professor at the University of Connecticut, she is the mother of a 14-year-old daugh - ter who was born prematurely after a high-risk pregnancy, as well as a 12-year-old daughter. She competes in triathlons, which involve gruel - ing early-morning training sessions for all three events\u2014swimming, running and cycling.Mutations sometimes arise spontaneously. Most genetic errors that oc- cur early\u2014when the embryo is dividing\u2014are so devastating that the baby doesn't survive. Humans have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs), each numbered from 1-22, plus an XX (female) or XY (male) pair that determines the baby's sex. Birth defects can result from an extra chromosome or deletions of genetic material. When a fetus has the wrong number of chromosomes, it's called an \"aneuploidy.\" Down syndrome results when the fetus has three copies of chromo - some 21. About 30 to 40 percent of infants with Down syndrome are born to women over age 35. By the time a woman reaches age 35, the odds of having a baby with any chromosome abnormality is about one in 178. In addition to Down syndrome (Trisomy 21), the new test can also detect Trisomy 13 and Trisomy 18. Playing the Odds Prospective parents roll the genetic dice every time they conceive a child. Although most infants are born healthy, any pregnant woman can be carry - ing a fetus with a chromo somal abnormality. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends early blood screening for genetic disorders for all women, regardless of age. The cell-free DNA test can be a follow-up if an ultrasound indicates the possibility of an extra chromosome, or if the pregnant woman has a personal or family history of genetic abnormalities. Chromosomal errors account for more than half of miscarriages and a small percentage of stillbirths, according to ACOG. \"If the test comes back positive, the patient meets with a genetic coun - selor,\" says perinatologist Deborah Feldman, M.D. \"The counselor works with the parents as they undergo CVS sampling or amniocentesis to rule out a suspected chromosomal abnormality.\" Both amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) are invasive tests that accurately identify chromosomal disorders. Amniocentesis, which involves removing a small sample of fetal cells from the amniotic fluid, car - ries a lower risk of miscarriage than CVS. Overall, the risks associated with amniocentesis are lower than a 35-year-old woman's risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome. \"According to recent research, the risk of miscar - riage with amniocentesis is only about one in 1,000,\" says Dr. Borgida. Hartford Hospital was the first hospital in Connecticut to offer first- trimester screening of pregnant women. \"Now, with the addition of the cell-free DNA test, the prenatal testing specialists at the hospital have a new way to detect birth defects as early as possible,\" says Dr. Borgida. \"Our patients want to know what they're facing.\" \"If there's a abnormality, it's always better to detect it so the parents can be prepared,\" adds Dr. Feldman. \"The test also provides earlier peace of mind for patients whose results are normal.\" For more information, see www.harthosp.org/women/HighRiskObstetrics/ PrenatalTestingCenterServices. 6Stopping the Bleeding... Before It Starts Benign fibroid tumors of the uterus afflict about 40 percent of wom - en over age 40 and account for a third of all hysterectomies performed each year in the United States. Fibroids can grow to an extremely large size, causing heavy bleeding, anemia, back and pelvic pain, urinary frequency or pressure on the bladder. Now a minimally invasive technique can stanch the bleeding before surgery begins. \"Markedly enlarged fibroids that fill the abdominal cavity are a challenge for surgeons,\" says John F. \"Jack\" Greene, Jr., M.D., of Women's Health Services at Hartford Hospital. \"These patients are more likely to experience significant blood loss, which slows healing and makes recovery difficult.\" At Hartford Hospital, interventional radiologist Michael Hallisey, M.D., pioneered the \"preoperative uterine artery embolization\" (PUAE) procedure, which is performed a few hours before the surgery. Preop embolization has been shown to decrease blood loss and lead to fewer complications. The non-surgical approach blocks the arteries leading to the uterus and starves the massive fibroid of its vital blood supply. \"Women with enormous fibroids are at high risk for bleeding and complications,\" says Dr. Hallisey. \"We insert a tiny catheter the size of a strand of spaghetti into the groin and thread it up to block the uterine arteries. A few hours later, the patient goes to the operating room for a hysterectomy with only minimal blood loss.\" Hysterectomy\u2014which permanently relieves pelvic pain and other symptoms\u2014is the most commonly performed major gynecologic surgi - cal procedure in the United States. Most women are candidates for a minimally invasive or robotic-assisted hysterectomy, but those with extremely large fibroids may need \"open\" surgery to remove an over - size uterus. Ultrasound of a fibroid in the muscular wall of the uterus 7Surgeon Dr. Chike V. Chukwumah prepares to repair a hernia. Hernias are not often recognized as a potentially serious medi - cal condition. Patients often en - dure significant recurring pain and undergo repetitive operations during their course of treatment. Hartford Hospital has built a reputation as a regional referral center of excellence for recurrent hernia repairs and com - plex abdominal wall reconstructions. An inguina l hernia, the most common type, occurs when part of an internal organ bulges through a weak area of muscle in the groin. An umbilical hernia occurs when a loop of intestine or fatty tissue protrudes through the abdominal wall next to the belly button. Inguinal hernias usually occur in men, while umbilical hernias occur equally often in men and women. Recurrent surgeries are especially common for umbilical hernias. \"We do a million hernia operations a year in this country,\" says general surgeon Chike V. Chukwumah, M.D. \"Although the perception is that 'it's just a hernia,' it can easily turn ugly.\" Repeats on the Rise Surgery is the only way to repair a hernia. Surgical repair eliminates the bulge\u2014and any pain it may be causing\u2014while preventing more seri - ous problems. Hernias can often be pushed back into place, or \"reduced,\" but an operation to repair the defect is usually recommended before pain and swelling can worsen. The smallest hernias are often the most dangerous. Trapped, or \"incar - cerated,\" hernias can turn into intes - tinal blockages or severe infections. Emergency surgery may be necessary to avoid life-threatening complica - tions when the blood supply is cut off (a \"strangulated\" hernia). A growing number of aging Americans suffer from hernias be -Hernia Repair: Getting It Right the First Time cause of obesity, smoking, immune problems and conditions like diabe - tes and chronic obstructive pul - monary disease (COPD). Weakness from a prior hernia surgery is a strong risk factor, since muscle never regains its original strength. Obesity Raises Risk Approximately 130 million Americans are overweight or obese, according to the latest data from the National Institutes of Health. When supervised dieting, exercise and be - havior modification fail, weight-loss surgery can help morbidly obese hernia patients lose weight before their hernia repair. \"The usual recurrence rate after hernia surgery is two to five percent,\" says Dr. Chukwumah. \"By contrast, hernia surgery needs to be repeated in about 40 percent of people with a body mass index (BMI) over 30. Lifestyle modifica - tions and a holistic approach can help patients lose weight. Obese patients have wound healing issues and much higher infection rates after any surgery.\" Smoking can cause deadly complications. \"We shouldn't do a hernia repair on a smoker,\" he says. \"Patients have to stop smoking. The nicotine in cigarettes is a vasocon - strictor that reduces blood flow and impairs healing. We have helped patients quit who have smoked for 30 or 35 years.\" About 90 percent of the time, the first elective hernia surgery can be performed with minimally inva - sive techniques and only few small incisions. Technical innovations in fiberoptics and high-tech mesh materials have reshaped surgery. \"Laparoscopy to repair a hernia electively can be done with less pain and an earlier return to work,\" says Dr. Chukwumah. \"Complex repairs typically require an 'open' incision and longer recuperation.\" Continuous Improvement Hernias tend to run in families because of collagen deficiencies that reduce healing and increase scarring. Although a hernia can be congeni - tal (occurring at birth), others are acquired by heavy lifting, repeated abdominal surgeries or multiple pregnancies. \"Hernias sometimes occur after a C-section,\" explains Dr. Chukwumah. \"Excess weight can cause an umbilical hernia that can be difficult to man - age during pregnancy. We have to balance the well-being of the mother and child.\" In men, the timing of hernia repair often depends on age. A Veterans Administration study showed that \"watchful waiting\" is often the best course in men of advanced age. \"If you're 30 years old, you're going to need repair,\" says Dr. Dr. Chukwumah. \"If you're 80, asymptomatic her - nias can be treated without surgery. Regional anesthesia is an option for patients in pain who can't tolerate general anesthesia.\" With a combination of pre-oper - ative anesthesia and post-operative pain management, Dr. Chukwumah and his surgical team constantly strive for improvement. \"We bring together specialists from various specialties and work closely with the hospital's superb wound care team,\" says Dr. Chukwumah. \"Our multi - disciplinary approach to complex hernias involves a dedicated team of plastic surgeons. Our goal is to provide the best possible follow-up care to prevent the patient from ever needing hernia surgery again.\" For more information, visit www. harthosp.org/Hernia/About. 9Sinuses are moist air spaces within the bones of the face around the nose. Normally, the sinuses are filled with air, but when the drainage system becomes blocked, the damp, dark spaces are a breeding ground for bacteria, viruses and fungi. An estimated 37 million Ameri-cans suffer inflammation (irritation and swelling) of the lining of the sinuses at least once each year. \"Chronic sinus - itis\" is usually caused by recurrent infections that never seem to go away. Eventually, many people with chronic nasal congestion, facial pain, constant pressure and a foul-tasting, yellow-green nasal discharge undergo endoscopic sinus surgery, a minimally invasive technique that can relieve pain and improve breathing. Most patients consider surgery only after being treated for allergies or recurrent sinusitis with an extended course of antibiotics, steroid nose spray and an oral steroid. Physicians unblock the sinuses by flexing a lighted scope up through the nostrils to open narrowed sinus passages. The procedure can correct chronic sinusitis or breathing problems caused by benign polyps, as well as structural abnormalities in the anatomy of the nasal airways. \"Surgery lets us reestablish the natural drainage pathways for the sinus - es,\" explains otorhino laryngologist Carl W. Moeller, M.D., who specializes in ear, nose and throat (ENT) disorders, particularly those relating to allergies and the sinuses. \"We use a kind of intraoperative GPS called 'stereotactic guidance' to provide 3D imaging for precise navigation.\" Until now, the narcotic fentanyl was used to control acute, moderate post-surgical pain. In a research paper published in the Journal of Allergy and Rhinology , Dr. Moeller showed that an intravenous (IV) nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAID) is a safe alternative to pain-killing opioids. The drug ketorolac (Toradol) is a non-narcotic analgesic similar to aspirin or ibuprofen. Traditionally, ENTs have avoided drugs like ketorolac because of a perceived risk of post-operative bleeding or hemorrhage. \"We performed a randomized, double-blinded trial to evaluate giving ketorolac immediately by IV after endoscopic sinus surgery,\" says Dr. Moeller. \"Neither the pa - tients nor the nurses knew which drug the patients received. We found no increased risk of bleeding.\" Diligent post-surgical care is vital to preventing the scarring that can narrow the nasal passages and reduce sinus drainage. \"Patients with chron - ic sinusitis that isn't responding to medications can benefit from endoscopic surgery,\" says Dr. Moeller. \"Now we can offer a safe and effective drug that allows people to get back on their feet quickly afterward.\"New Option for Pain Relief After Sinus Surgery 10R esearchers worldwide are scrutinizing the faulty genes that go awry in mental illness. Although mo - lecular genetics has spurred a revolution in personalized medicine, the search for a \"depression gene\" remains elusive. Major depression is often chronic, severe, and as - sociated with other illnesses. Despite the benefits of antidepressant drugs and therapy, depression remains the number one cause of disability in the United States. Most scientists now believe that depression arises from a complex interplay of genes and the environment. \"Major depression runs in families, but not all depres - sion is genetic,\" says David neurosci - entist at Olin Neuropsychiatry Center at the Institute of Living (IOL). \"Many people have a depressive episode at some time during their lives. So far, despite a com - parative study of more than 20,000 individuals by the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium, researchers haven't found a specific gene that causes major depression.\" Scientists recognize that many biological pathways are at work in depression, but have not yet identified the mechanisms of inheritance. Research is driven by overwhelming evidence of the heritability of diseases like depression and schizophrenia. Dr. Glahn and his colleagues at the IOL's Olin Center recently published a groundbreaking paper in Biological Psychiatry that identi - fied a new risk gene for major depression. \"We found that individuals with major depression have changes in brain anatomy,\" says Dr. Glahn. \"Some of these changes are associated with genes that are known to cause depression.\" Prior research has focused on an imbalance in neu - rotransmitters (chemical messengers) in an area of the brain called the hypothalamus. \"We know that the hypo - thalamus controls apathy and that it's linked to depres - sion,\" says Dr. Glahn. \"We studied more than a thousand people from big families to figure out which brain changes are genetic.\" The Olin Center's advanced research tools for imaging the brain include functional, structural and spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Each study participant had an anatomic MRI scan and provided blood samples for analysis and \"transcriptional profiling\" of their DNA. Scientists know that differences in DNA transcrip - tion can alter the expression of a gene. \"We found that a transcript of the RNF123 gene is associated with depres - sion,\" says Dr. Glahn. \"We think that RNF123 may change the function of the hypothalamus by affecting how nerve cells (neurons) in the brain develop and communicate with each other.\" Dr. Glahn recently received a $60,000 grant from Hartford Hospital for a pilot project to study 75 symptom - atic people to determine whether or not they have the risk gene. Dr. Glahn is seeking volunteers with either major depression or bipolar disorder to participate in a study to will lay the groundwork for a much bigger study. Why do people who don't have the gene get depres - sion? Is RNF123 altered in bipolar disorder as well? Can the RNF123 gene or its transcript predict the outcome or course of major depression? People may want to know that they are genetically vulnerable to depression at some point, regardless of their current state of mind. \"Current treatments for psychiatric disorders focus on neurotransmitters like serotonin or dopamine and are relatively blunt tools,\" says Dr. Glahn. \"In contrast, 'per - sonalized' medicine based on the patient's own genetics may someday provide more effective 'targeted' drugs that would have fewer side-effects. If our results hold up, it could be the turning point for our understanding of the genetics of depression.\" To find out if you meet the criteria to participate in the pilot study, call Jennifer at 860-545-7808. Diving Into The Gene Pool The Legacy of Depression 11What's Going Around... News & Breakthroughs Our Garage Is Going \"Green\" Parking will become easier next year when the parking lot adjacent to the 85 Seymour Street medical office building opens to the public. Patients, their families and visi - tors will benefit from convenience and proximity when we free up the current employ - ee garage space directly across from the hospital's main entrance. A new 440,000-square-foot, nine-story employee parking garage on Hudson Street will add 1,250 parking spaces. The new garage will be a model for such structures in the future, paving the way for other \"green\" buildings that will make life safer and more convenient for staff members. Scheduled to open in early 2013, it is part of a 10-year plan intended to transform the Hartford Hospital campus. The building, which will help restore green space to the area by creating a pedestrian-scale park, will also be one of the safest garages in the country. Staff members will not have to cross the street on ground level, but can walk through in a pedestrian walkway. Employees can take advantage of a new exercise facility on the street front, complete with group classes to help promote a healthy work-life balance. 12Stroke Window Widens A report in Lancet says the \"window\" for treating stroke victims with a clot- busting drug can be safely expanded to six hours. The Scottish study suggests that even those over age 80 could benefit from early treatment with tissue plas - minogen activator (tPA). People treated within three hours are most likely to be alive and independent six months later.Calcium Caution Researchers who followed 24,000 Germans for a de - cade say those who regu - larly took calcium supple - ments were 86% more likely to have a heart attack than those who didn't take supplements, reports the journal Heart . A balanced diet containing calcium- rich dairy foods, sardines, tofu and green leafy veg - etables may be a better way to stave off bone-thinning osteoporosis.Summer Sun Safety The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will require new labeling to en - sure that products marked \"Broad-Spectrum SPF\" really protect against both ultra - violet (UV) A and B rays. Sunscreens sold this sum - mer may protect against sunburn, but not prema - ture skin aging and skin cancer. As of December, the FDA will also ban \"sweat - proof,\" \"waterproof\" and \"sunblock\" claims. Are You At Risk? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently drafted new recommenda - tions calling for all Baby Boomers to be tested for hepatitis C. New treatments for the liver-destroying virus are now available. People may have been infected decades ago by intravenous drug use or transfusions before routine blood testing began in 1992. in the Doctor's Office Robotics for Gallbladder Surgery 13The gallbladder stores bile, which digests the fat in food. An acute gallbladder attack occurs when a gallstone blocks the flow of bile. The bile backs up, causing nausea, vomiting, and disabling pain anywhere from the upper abdomen to the shoulder blades. While emergency surgery may be required for a severely inflamed or infected gallbladder, people with chronic gallstones or \"biliary colic\" often suffer a series of excruciating episodes. Although some individuals have no symptoms, others suffer painful spasms as gallstones pass through inflamed or narrowed ducts. Over the past decade, minimally invasive surgery has replaced a long \"open\" incision with only a few band-aid- size slits for instruments and a pencil-thin laparoscope. Smaller scars, less pain, minimal blood loss and a speedy recovery have driven the rapid adoption of minimally invasive surgery in recent years. More than one million people undergo surgery for gall - bladder removal, or cholecystectomy, in the United States each year. Most operations are performed with traditional laparoscopy, requiring several incisions. Elective surgery to remove the diseased organ can now be performed with only a single incision through the belly button, thanks to a new surgical option. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved single-incision, robotic-assisted gallbladder surgery in late 2011. In April, Hartford Hospital became the first in the state to perform the surgery, which takes about an hour with a typical inpatient stay of less than 24 hours. Led by surgeon Darren Tishler, M.D., the team removed the diseased gallbladder by manipulating robotic arms through a single, inch-long incision in the belly button. Patients who regularly suffer repeated bouts of sudden pain can now undergo a virtually scar-free procedure. Most people who require gallbladder removal are candi - dates for the robotic, single-incision surgery. \"The main advantage for the patient is cosmetic,\" says Dr. Tishler. \"The standard of care for gallbladder removal is still lapa - roscopic surgery, which requires several small incisions.\" Combining robotic surgery with a single belly-button incision requires advanced training and technology. \"It's my responsibility as a surgeon to provide patients with the most up-to-date surgical options,\" says Dr. Tishler, one of a small group of surgeons in the country who have per - formed the surgery. \"The robot's dexterity is equivalent to laparoscopy, but its main advantage is the crystal-clear visualization,\" he says. The surgical robot's versatility allows Dr. Tishler to sit at a nearby console, using joysticks to control the in - struments as he visualizes the entire surgical field on a 3D display. In real-time, the system translates his movements into precise manipulations of miniaturized instruments inside the patient. Removal of the gallbladder is just the latest innovation in surgical robotics. Hartford Hospital surgeons have pio - neered numerous robotic procedures since 2003, when the hospital became the first medical center in Connecticut to acquire the revolutionary da Vinci robot. Hartford Hospital physicians now perform more than 1,000 robotic cases each year. \"The FDA only recently approved the use of robotics for gallbladder removal,\" says Dr. Tishler. \"We are thrilled to be one of the first hospitals to offer this technically ad - vanced surgery. We envision that single-incision, robotic- assisted techniques will eventually be expanded to other urologic, gynecologic and abdominal procedures.\" For more information, visit www.harthosp.org/robotics/ gallbladder.We are thrilled to be one of the first hospitals to offer this technically advanced surgery. \u2014Dr. Darren TishlerWe welcome some of the newest members of our Hartford Hospital Medical Staff.
