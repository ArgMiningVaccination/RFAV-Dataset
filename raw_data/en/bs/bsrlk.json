There are many ways to consume the plant, but most often, it is consumed through a cigarette. Over many years, marijuana has been looked at as a gateway drug Increasingly, more and more evidence shows how cannabidiol (CBD) cannabis is making a positive impact in treating children with rare diseases, particularly seizure conditions. The story of Jayden David, first shown on the Sanjay Gupta's documentary Weed Wars, is only one of many that deserves to be told, as it highlights just how CBD oil is making a difference in the lives of families that dared to try their luck with an alternative form of treatment. CBD hemp oil, derived from the cannabis plant industrial hemp has been shown to alleviate a myriad of health conditions. Research and personal stories are expanding the dialogue on just how medical cannabis could be beneficial in treating conditions such as Dravet syndrome that plagues Jayden. CBD oil had made an incredible impact in Jayden's life by reducing the frequency of his seizures and improving his quality of life. Marijuana, in a medical form, can reduce seizure activity in people with epilepsy, especially when all other forms of treatment have been exhausted. One such case was with a girl by the name of Charlotte Figi, who first started having seizures at 3 months old, and by the time she was 5 was having 300 seizures each week. When the hospital told the parents there was nothing more they could do for Charlotte, they turned to medical marijuana. After working with doctors to find the correct dosage of cannabis oil that was needed, Charlotte, at the age of 6, was only having two to three seizures per month (Young, Marijuana Stops Child's Seizures, CNN.com). Additionally, while the personal stories of those who have seen a reduction in the number of seizures that occur from the use of medical marijuana are more prevalent than that of published studies by doctors, these studies do exist and show A two year old, named Jaqie Angel Warrior had been suffering from several types of seizures ever since she was five months old. Doctors had tried many medications to control her seizures, such as klonopin , and depakote; but all failed to stop these thousands of seizures, resulting in terrible side effects. Jaqie's mother, Brittany had been researching other potential cures, when she came across cannabis oil. Soon after, they moved to a motel in Colorado, and began using high-CBD oil, which also contains high levels of THC. Levels higher than any other states CBD-only bill allows. Since they began using the cannabis oil, Jaqie's seizures have reduced by 90%, and Brittany ceased use of any dangerous pharmaceuticals. (Patient Success) It is true that medical marijuana can begin the process to slow down a disease. The deterioration of the human brain from Alzheimer's, for instance, medical marijuana can slow down the progression of the human brain from deteriorating. There are healing agents within medical marijuana that the Government and the Many states have legalized cannabis, for example, Colorado has already seen many positive results. The economy has been in an upwards advantage with raising over ten million taxes from the retail sale of cannabis within the first four months. They will use the first forty million of the Eight-year old Charlotte Figi experienced her first seizure at three months old. While all test results were normal, her seizures were increasing in length as time went on, usually lasting two to four hours. According to the CNN report, \"Marijuana Stops Child's Severe Seizures,\" by Saundra Young, she was on Some Traditional Drugs are Potentially More Dangerous than Cannabis Anti-epileptic pharmaceutical drugs are powerful drugs that children with varying forms of epilepsy are often prescribed. Current epilepsy drug affects different parts of the brain, including the brain stem, which can basically shut off the body's critical function if dosage is significant. Marijuana doesn't do that and is part of the reason so many doctors are changing their minds. Marijuana may be safer because of cannabidiol, which with overstimulation or inhibition, does not shut off breathing or respiration like anti-epileptic drug could cause. Marijuana is a drug misunderstood by many nation wide however, most people do not consider it 's legitimate medicinal application. Medical marijuana defined by Drugfacts refers to the use of the whole unprocessed plant to treat a disease or illness. The Drug Enforcement Administration has listed it under the schedule I classification which is the same classification that heroin, LSD, ecstasy and many other drugs are under. The classification identifies the drug as a dangerous substance that has no recognized medicinal use as reported by the DEA. It 's classification as a highly regulated Schedule I drug makes it challenging to study its medical benefits. Due to this classification, marijuana is commonly regarded by the general public as possessing \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse\" (DEA.gov). The DEA has yet to acknowledge many conducted scientific studies that point to the very tangible medical benefits of cannabinoids (Voth and Schwartz 1997). The blockade on marijuana research has caused a severe halt in reaping the benefits of THC. The drug is a better alternative than many drugs given to patients as seen in some cases of neurological disorders such as epilepsy and chronic terminal conditions like cancer, because of its \"analgesic, sedative, and anticonvulsant\" properties (Abood, Sorensen, and Stella 2012). Marijuana can serve as both a viable treatment option and improves the quality of life through its pain relieving capacities. While While there have recently been a couple of states that are shifting their laws to allow marijuana, there are still over 20 states in the U.S that have laws governing against the usage of medical marijuana. Marijuana has a number of effects on a person depending on how it is ingested. These risk factors include altered senses, impaired body movement and impaired memory. In the long run, marijuana is said to affect the brain's development. \"When marijuana users begin using as teenagers, the drug may reduce thinking, memory, and learning functions and affect how the brain builds connections between the areas necessary for these functions\" (\"Drug Facts-Marijuana\"). With that being said, it is easy to understand why marijuana is not completely legalized. On the other side of that argument, people are slowly starting to realize that marijuana can very much so help a patient cope with their diseases. Within the past 4 years, the usage of medical marijuana for children with severe forms of epilepsy has gained a great deal of attention. The most severe form of epilepsy is referred to as Dravet Syndrome, it is described as \"a rare form of intractable epilepsy. Intractable means the seizures are not controlled by medication. The first seizures with Dravet Syndrome usually start before the age of 1. In the second year, other seizures take hold: myoclonus, or involuntary, muscle spasms and status epileptics, seizures that last more than 30 minutes or come in clusters, one after the other\" (\"Marijuana Stops Child's Severe Seizures\"). America was first exposed to the idea of curing Dravet Syndrome through the usage of medical marijuana when the documentary \"Weed\" was broadcasted on CNN in August of 2013. The documentary featured the case of Charlotte Figi, a five-year-old suffering from Dravet Syndrome. Before Charlotte began Miranna Bass Simons Intro to Writing 13 May 2016 The Blunt Truth about Marijuana Imagine having a son or daughter who has six or more seizures a day. If you could could decrease the number of seizures they had a day by half, wouldn't you consider medical marijuana?

Among the diseases marijuana can help treat, nausea, glaucoma, anorexia, epilepsy and more. Medical marijuana also helps with the side effects of many treatments, such as cancer chemotherapy. There are many health benefits of marijuana; it may have some negative effects, but the pain and symptom relief of many diseases and disorders makes it well worth it. Prohibiting this process in essence means abandoning human life. Marijuana is the most essential and therapeutically active substance that has been discovered by man. Therefore, medical cannabis refers to the use of the cannabis drug as recommended herbal therapy by physicians. This is mostly known as antiemetic. The experimental demonstration of marijuana's significant properties thousands of years ago proves that it is one of the most essential substances that can be used in manufacturing drugs (Minamide). As provided from the ancient Indians, its psychoactive properties were realized which triggered its use by doctors to treat a variety of ailments and illnesses. This argument has been supported by the modern scientific experiment in the United States. Researchers have found that marijuana was greatly important in treatment of gastrointestinal disorders, headaches, pain reliever mostly in childbirth. In addition, they also found out that smoking marijuana reduces pain, especially with patients suffering from cancer, glaucoma, and chemotherapy (Minamide). In the recent past, marijuana has been found to be an important substance on AIDs patients where it reduces nausea, vomiting, and appetite loss. Moreover, it was recognized as a significant substance in relieving glaucoma eye pressure. It was also shown that it plays a vital role in Multiple Sclerosis. It reduces muscle pain, spasticity, and reduces diseases that cause body tremors. Epilepsy, Lexis, There are a lot of negative material out there on the negative effects of Marijuana use.

Moreover, mental diseases such as the Parkinson's disease and the Multiple Sclerosis can be treated with marijuana thanks to two substances it contains called cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol, which permit to reduce inflammation, control spasms, and even prevent neurological damage. For instance, an Australian mother Cheri O'Connell revealed in a report of Herald Sun News about the benefits of liquid marijuana, which she says saved her epileptic daughter Tara who was only given months to live. In fact, Tara could barely walk or talk, and she slept as much as a newborn. She endured more than 20,000 seizures every year; her condition left her parents and siblings, exhausted and scared for the future. Running out of options, they met another family, who had lost a similar battle. This family advices the O'Connell's to try Marijuana. Then, they did so, and Tara is now seizure-free, walking, running and even dancing after one year of treatment. Cheri says, \"We didn't see her having a future at all. But I can now see us being able to "}
