Of course, following recommended guidelines is key, but we also need to be diligent about our immune system. An immune system in a weakened state makes us more vulnerable to viruses and illnesses. There are natural things you can do and steps you can take to help boost immune system. At Arizona's New Serenity Spa, we actually are firm believers in massage as a tremendous way to boost immune system. [Clients not only feel amazing following their massage experience but also they are overall healthier.](http://newserenityspa.com/lymphatic-drain-massage-spa-massage-new-serenity-spa-scottsdale/) Below are a few natural ways that you can help your immune system stay strong! To Boost Immune System Consider Doing These Things You must listen to your body. It tells you what you need to do in order to stay healthy and calm. [It is when we don't listen to our body and its needs that our immune system can get compromised.](https://www.everydayhealth.com/columns/white-seeber-grogan-the-remedy-chicks/ten-simple-natural-ways-to-boost-immune-system/) - Get enough sleep. Not getting enough sleep leaves you exhausted. You are far less effective when it comes to even small daily tasks, not to mention work. Also, keep in mind lack of sleep can increase stress levels and this also serves to weaken your immune system. - Cut back on alcohol. Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can actually impair your immune system. - Get some sun. It is well documented that the sun's rays help spur Vitamin D, and Vitamin D is known to help the body in numerous ways. Without enough of this essential vitamin we are far more at risk of getting viruses and infections. - Get a massage. As already noted, massage can be incredibly helpful to your immune system as it increases blood flow, lowers blood pressure and stimulates the production of lymphocytes. - Eat more garlic. Yes, garlic is known to be a natural immune booster. You can sprinkle the powder form on a variety of dishes. Some Other Things to Try and Boost Immune System - Exercise more. When you exercise your white blood cells are mobilized, this in turn can be a huge boost to your immune system. - Reduce stress. Stress is a major culprit as far as undermining the immune system. Meditate, take a nap, read, whatever you need to do to get rid of that stress. - Take herbal supplements. If you google it, you will find a number of key herbal supplements that really do work in terms of boosting the immune system. - Drink more water. Drinking water is always a good idea, for all aspects of your body. Water also helps to eliminate wastes and toxins in your system. - Avoid tobacco. Smoking can certainly weaken your immune system, not to mention make you more susceptible to respiratory infections.
