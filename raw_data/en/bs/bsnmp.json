T his resource has not so far been ad equately utilized. The practitioners of AYUSH systems enjoy high local acceptance and respect and consequently exert considerable influence on health beliefs and practices. It is, therefore, necessary to initiate organized measures to enable each of these systems of medicine and health care to develop in accordance with their strengths. Simultaneously, planned efforts should be made to dovetail the functioning of the practitioners and integrate their service, at the appropriate levels, within specified areas of responsibility and functioning, in the over-all health care delivery system, especially with regard to the preventive, promotive and public health objectives. Well- considered steps would also be required to be taken to move towards a meaningful phased integration of the indigenous and the modern systems. The significance of the Alternative Systems of Medicine was further emphasized in the National Health Policy, 2002, 4***which stated that Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy have a substantial role because of the inherent advantages, such as diversity, modest cost, low level of technological input and the growing popularity of natural plant based products, especially in the 3. **National Health Policy, 1983 accessed from www.mohfw.nic.in 4. *** National Health Policy, 2002 accessed from www.mohfw.nic.inunder-served, remote and tribal areas. The Policy also envisaged the consolidation of documentary knowledge contained in these systems to prot ect it against attack from foreign commercial entities by way of malafide action under the Patent laws i n other countries. 1.4 The Nationa l Policy on Indian Systems of Medicine & Homoeopathy, 2002 enunciated following as its objectives: (1) To promote good health and expand the outreach

A YUSH is an acronym for A yurveda, Y oga & , Unani, Siddha & Sowa Rigpa, and Homoeopathy . Ayurveda is the oldest system with documented history of itspractice since more than 5000 years whereas Homeopathy is in practice in India for around 100 years. Thesesystems are being practised in the country with diverse preferences of people and infrastructural facilities. A yurveda is more prevalent in the States Nadu, Bihar the North Eastern States and the Siddha system is practiced in T amil Nadu, Pondicherry and Kerala. Recently recognized Sowa Rigpa system of medicine is prevalent educational institutes of Sowa Rigpa in UP and Karnataka. A YUSH services in the country as a whole are provided by public, private and voluntary sector organization sand the range of their distribution varies from State t o State. 2.2 A YURVEDA SYSTEM 2.2.1 ' A yurveda' literally means \"Science of Life\". A yurveda is evolved from the various V edic hymns rooted in the fundamental philosophies about life, disease and health.The Charak Samhita and Sushruta Samhita developed around 2500 BC are the main treaties of Ayurveda fully available today. Accordingto A yurveda, health is considered as a pre-requisite for achieving the goals of life i.e., Dharma, Artha, Kama and Moksha. A yurveda takes an integrated view of the physical, mental, spiritual and social aspects of human beings and about the interrelationships between these aspects.AYUSH SYSTEMSCHAPTER 27 ANNUAL REPORT 2015-162.2.2 The philosophy of A yurveda is based on the theory of Panchmahabhutas (five primordialelements), which postulates that all objects and living bodies are composed of five elements Aakasha, Vayu, Agni, Jala and Prithvi. The combinations of these five elements are represented in the form of Tridoshas viz. V ata (Ether+ Air), Pitta (Fire) and Kapha(W ater+ Earth). These three `Doshas' are physiological entities in living beings, whereas Satva, Rajas and T amas are the mental attributes. The structural entities of the human body are the matrix of Rasa, Rakta, Mamsa Meda, Asthi, Majja and Shukra. A yurveda aims to keep these structural and functional entities in a state of equilibrium which signifies good health (Swasthya). Any imbalance due to internal or external factors causes disease and the treatment consists of restoring the equilibrium through various interventions including therapeutic procedures, regimens, medicines and lifestyle management. 2.2.3 Ayurveda considers the human being as a microcosm (Y atha pinde tatha brahmande) which is a replica of the macrocosm (universe).The treatment in A yurveda is holistic and individualized. The preventive aspect of Ayurveda is called Svastha-Vritta and itincludes personal hygiene, regular daily routine, appropriate social behavior and use of Rasayana. The curative aspect consists of three major categories (i) Aushadhi (drugs) (ii) V arious therapeutic procedures including Panchakarma and Surgeryand (iii) Satvavajaya (Methods for Mind control ). 2.2.4 Practic e of Ayurveda as a system of medicine has been recognized under IMCC Act 1970. The education of Ayurveda is regulated by a statutory body Central Council of Indian Medicine (CCIM). Drugs& Cosmetics Act 1940 regulates manufacturing and sales Ayurvedic drugs.During the Samhita period (1000 BC), A yurveda developed with eight branches or specialties, due to which it iscalled as Ashtanga A yurveda. Following are the specialties of clinical medicine in Ayurveda: - (1) Kayachikitsa (Internal Medicine) (2) Kaumar Bhritya (Pediatrics) (3) Graha Chikitsa (Psychiatry) (4) Shalakya (Eye, ENT and Dentistry) (5) Shalya T antra (Surgery) Agada-T antra (Immuno-modulation and Gerentology) (8) V ajikarna (Science of fertility and healthy progeny) 2.2.5 The above eight branches have over the years and specifically during the last 50 years expanded into 22 specialties for post-graduate education as follows: (1) A yurveda Siddhanta (Funda- mental Swasth-Vritta (Social and Preventive Medicine) (10) Kayachikitsa (Internal Medicine) (11) Rog Nidana Evum Vikriti Vigyan (Diagnostics and Pathology) (12) ) ChhayaavumVikiranVigyan (Radiology) 2.2.6 Courses of study for award of Bachelor , Master and Doctorate degrees in A yurveda are imparted through the various universities of India. 2.2.7 Three volumes of A yurvedic Formulary of India (AFI) containing 980 compound formulations and eight volumes of A yurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) Part-1containing 600 monographs on single drugs and three volume s of A yurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India (API) Part-II containing 152 monographs on compound formulations have been published. 2.3 SIDDHA SYSTEM 2.3.1 The Siddha System of medicine is one of the ancie nt systems of medicine in India having its close with Dravidian culture. The term Siddha means achievements and Siddhars are those who have achieved perfection in medicine. Eighteen Siddhars are said to have contributed towards the systematic development of this system and recorded their experiences in Tamil language. 2.3.2 The Siddha system of Medicine emphasizes on the patient, environment, age, sex, race, habits, mental frame work, habitat, diet, appetite, physical condition, physiological constitution of the diseases for its treatment which is individualistic in nature Diagnosis of diseases are done through examination of pulse, urine, eyes, study of voice, colour of body, tongue and status of the digestion of individual patients. System has unique treasure for the conversion of metals and minerals as drugs and many infective diseases are treated with the medicines containing specially processed mercury, silver, arsenic, lead and sulphur without any side effects. The strength of the Siddha system lies in providing very effective therapy in the case of Psoriasis, Rheumatic disorders, Chronic liver disorders, Benign prostate hypertrophy, bleeding piles, peptic ulcer including various kinds of Dermatological disorders of non psoriat ic nature.9 ANNUAL REPORT 2015-162.3.3 There are nine Sidd ha Medical College and one Nation al Institute are available in our country. In these three post Gradates course are available. During the last six decades, there has been continuous development in Siddha medical education and this has led to the establishment of the National Institute of Siddha at Chennai as apex Institute having six specialties in post- graduate teaching leading to the award of M.D(S) Degree. 2.3.4 For development of focused research in Siddha System of medicine Govt. has constituted Central Council for Research in Siddha (CCRS), an autonomous body by bifurcating Central Council for Research in Ayurveda and Siddha (CCRAS). In CCRS is under going the Research Work of Madhu Megam (Diabetes), Lecoderma and Hyper Tension etc. 2.4 UNANI MEDICINE 2.4.1 The Unani System of Medicine originated in Greece and passed through many countries before establishing itself in India during the medieval period. It is based on well- established knowledge and practices relating to the promotion of positive health and prevention of disease. The fusion of traditional knowledge of ancient civilizations like Egypt, Arabia, Iran, China, Syria and India. It emphasizes the use of naturally occurring mostly herbal medicines and also uses some medicines of animals, marine and mineral origin. This system of medic ine was documented in Al- Qanoon,a medical classics, by Sheikh Bu-Ali Sina (Avicena) (980-1037) AD), in Al-Havi by Razi (850-923 AD) and in many others books written by the Unani physi cians. 2.4.2 The Unani System is based on the humoral theory i.e. the presence of blood, phlegm , yellow bile and black bile in every person. The temperament of a person can accordingly be Sanguine, Phlegmatic, Choleric and Melancholic depending on the presence and combination of the Humors. According to Unani theory, the humors and the drugs themselves are assigned temperaments. Any change in quantity and quality of the humors bring about a change in the status of the health of the human body. A proper balance of humors required of the maintenance of health. 2.4.3. The treatment consists of four components, namely, Preventive, Promotive, Curative and Rehabilitative. Unani system of medicine has been found to be efficacious in many conditions, particularly Chronic and Degenerative disorders e.g. Rhumatoid Arhritis, Hepatitis, Filariasis, Eczema, Sinusitis and Bronchial Asthma etc. 2.4.4. For the prevention of disease and promotion of health, the Unani system emphasizes on six essential pre-requisites of life (Asbab-e-Sitta Zarooria) - (i) Pure air (ii) Food and Beverages (iii) Physical movement and Rest (iv) Psychic movement and Rest (v) Sleep and Wakefulness and (vi) Retention of useful materials and Evacuation of waste materials from the body. 2.4.5. There are four forms of treatment in Unani Yad]. Re gimen therapy (Ilaj-bit-Tadbir) is a speciality under which various methods of treatment are used for treating specific and complicated disease. 2.4.6 Education and Practice of Unani as a system of medicine has been recognized under IMCC act 1970. The education of Unani is regulated by a statutory body Central Council Of Indian Medicine [CCIM]. The manufacturing and sale of Unani drugs is regulated by Drug & Cosmetic Act 1940 . 2.4.7 During the last 50 years ,10 Post Graduate specialities have been developed in (i) Kulliyat (Fundamental of Unani System of Medicine ), (viii) National Formulary of Unani Medicine (NFUM) containing 1228 compound formulation and six volumes of Unani Phamacopeia of India (UPI) containing 298 monographs on single drugs have been published. Two volumes of Pharmacopeia on compound formulations containing 100 compound drugs have also been published. 2.4.9 There ar e 46 Educational Institution of Unani Medicine in the country, out of which 8 Institutions are awarding MD degree in Unani Medicine.Goverment Of India h as stablished a National Institute Of Unani Medicine (NIUM) at Bangalore for Post Graduate courses. This Institute is a Premium Centre for higher education and Research in all aspect of Unani Medicine.Apart from this a Ph.D programme in Moalajat has been recently started in the Institute . 2.4.10 For the Propagation and Development of Unani Medicine,the Govt. of India has created Unani Chair in the University of Western Cape at Cape Town, South Africa. 2.4.11 Having vast infrastructure of Unani medicine in terms of Health care delivery system, Research & Educational Institutions and Drug Manufacturing Industries, India is considered as world leader in the field of Unani Medicine. 2.5 HOMOEOPATHY 2.5.1 The Physicians from the time of Hippocrates (around 400 B.C.) have observed that certain substances could produce symptoms of a disease in healthy people similar to those of people suffering from the disease. Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician scientifically examined this phenomenon and codified the fundamental principles of Homoeopathy. Homoeopathy was brought into India around 1810 A.D. by European missionaries and received official r ecognition by a Resolution passed by the Constituent Assembly in 1948 and then by the Parliament. 2.5.2 The first principle of Homoeopathy 'Similia Similibus Curentur', says that a medicine which could induce a set of symptoms i n healthy human beings 11 ANNUAL REPORT 2015-16would be capable of curing a similar set of symptoms in human beings actually suffering from the disease. The second principle of 'Single Medicine' says that one medicine should be administered at a time to a particular patient during the treatment. The third principle of 'Minimum Dose' states that the bare minimum dose of a drug which would induce a curative action without any adverse effect should be administered. Homoeopathy is based on the assumption that the causation of a disease mainly depends upon the susceptibility or proneness of an individual to the incidence of the particular disease in addition to the action of external agents like bacteria, viruses, etc. 2.5.3 Homoeopathy is a method of treating diseases by administering drugs, which have been experimentally proved to possess the power to produce similar symptoms on healthy human beings. Treatment in Homoeopathy, which is holistic in nature, focuses on an individual's response to a specific environment. Homoeopathic medicines are prepared mainly from natural substances, such as plant products, minerals and from animal sources, nosodes & sarcodes etc. Homoeopathic medicines do not have any toxic, poisonous or side effects. Homoeopathic treatment is economical as well and has a very broad public acceptance. 2.5.4 Homoeop athy has its own areas of strength in therapeutics and it is particularly u seful in treatment for allergies, autoimmune disorders and vi ral i nfections. Many surgical, gynaecological and obstetrical and paed iatric conditions and ailments affecting the eyes, nose, ear, teeth, skin, sexual organs, etc. are amenable to homoeopathic treatment. Behavioral disorder, neurological problems and metabolic diseases can also be successfully treated by Homoeopathy. Apart from the curative aspects, Homoeopathic medicines are also used in preventive and promotive health care. In recent times, there is an emergence of interest in the use of Homoeopathic medicines in veterinary care, agriculture, dentistry, etc. Homoeopathic medical education has developed in seven specialties in post-graduate teaching, which are Materia Medica, Organon of Medicine, Repertory, Practice of Medicine, Paediatrics, Pharmacy and Psychiatry. 2.6 YOGA 2.6.1 Yoga is essentially spiritual and it is an art and science of healthy living which focuses on bringing harmony between body and mind. The word 'Yoga' has two meanings; the first comes from the root 'Yujir' or 'Union', the second is derived from a different root 'yuja' which means 'Samadhi' - the highest state of mind and the absolute knowledge. These two are the most important meanings of the word Yoga accordin g to 'Panini', the most well- known Sanskrit grammarian. 2.6.2 Yoga is being practiced as part of healthy lifestyle and has become part of our spiritual heritage. In the presen t era, Yoga is popular world- wide because of its spirit ual values, therapeutic cre dentials, its role in the prevention of d iseases, promotion of 12 ANNUAL REPORT 2015-16health and management of lifestyle related disorders. Several clinical studies have lucidly demonstrated the therapeutic potentials of Yoga in the treatment of many lifestyle related or psychosomatic disorders. The specialty of this system is that it can get along with any other systems of health care. 2.6.3 The aim of Yoga is complete cessation of all kinds of suffering (sorrow) and its root cause ignorance and is known as Moksha or liberation. The main objectives of Yoga are health, happiness, harmony, spiritual quest, personality development, etc. 2.6.4 Yoga is as old as civilization. The first archaeological evidence of existence of Yoga is found in Stone Seals of excavated f rom Indus Valley. Yoga was special feature of Indus Valley Civilization (3000 BC).

It has it sown concept of health and disease and principles of treatment. 14 ANNUAL REPORT 2015-16Naturopathy is a system of medicine that advocates harmonious living with constructive principles of Nature on physical, mental, moral and spiritual planes. It has great health promotive and restorative, and disease preventive as well as curative potential. 2.7.2 According to Naturopathy the primary cause of disease, barring accidental or surgical injury, is violation of Nature's laws and the effects of violation of Nature's la ws are- 1. Low ered vitality; 2. Abnormal composition of blood and lymph; 3. Accumulation of morbid matter in the body. 2.7.3 The science of Naturopathy teaches us that the disease is Nature's effort to eliminate the morbid matter from the body to restore the health. Hence, we must not suppress the out ward symptoms of disease like fever, cough, loose motions etc. but cooperate with Nature in the process of eliminating morbid matter from the body. 2.7.4 Some of the basic concepts of Naturopathy are outlined as under: 1. Naturopathy believes in the concept of unity of disease and unity of cure. According to it root cause of all diseases are one that is accumulation of morbid matter in the body and the remedy also is one i.e. elimination of those toxins from the body. 2. Naturopathy considers bacteria and virus to be secondary cause of disease. The primary cause of disease is accumulation of morbid matter in the body. The microbes survive in the body only when a favourable atmosphere for their growth is established by the accumulation of morbid matter. Hence, the basic cause of disease is morbid matter and microbes are only the se condary cause. 3. Acute diseases are self-healing efforts of the body. Hence, they are taken as our friends, not enemies. Chronic diseases are outcome of wrong treatment and suppression of the acute diseases. 4. Human body has remarkable recuperative powers when left alone. Nature is the greatest healer. The human body is a self- healing machine. It is endowed with inherent healing power to prevent itself from disease and regain health when fallen ill. 5. In Naturopathy the patient is at the center of intervention and treatment, cure of disease is effected automatically with the increase in vitality and detoxification of body. 6. Naturopathy believes in holistic treatment. It not only treats the body as a whole, instead of specific organs but also take into account intervention at mental, moral and spiritual planes.15 ANNUAL REPORT 2015-167. Naturopathy does not use medicines. According to it, \"Food is Medicine\". 8. Naturopathy accepts prayers also as a modality of treatment. According to Gandhiji \"Rama Nama is the best Natural Treatment\" meaning there by that prayer according to one's own faith is an important part of treatment. 2.7.5 Some of the important therapies/ therapeutic modalities of Naturopathy which are employed not only for curative purposes but also for prevention of diseases and promotion of health are as under- (i) Upvas Chikitsa (Fasting Therapy) (ii) Aahar Chikitsa ( Therapy) (iii) Mitti Chikitsa (Mud Therapy) (iv) Jala Chikitsa (Hydrotherapy) 2.8 SOWA-RIGPA 2.8.1 Sowa-Rigpa is among the oldest surviving health traditions of the world with a living history of more than 2500 years. It has been in vogue and practised in Himalayan regions throughout particularly in managing chronic diseases like Asthma, Bronchitis, Arthritis, etc. The basic theory of Sowa-Rigpa is explained in terms of (i)The body and the mind as the locus of treatment; (ii)Antidote, i.e. the treatment;(iii) The method of treatment through antidote;(iv)Medicines that cure the disease and lastly (v) Pharmacology.

Over the years, the Council has evolved into a premier research organization with the objective of undertaking research in Homoeopathy in the fundamental and applied aspects on modern parameters. The Council is engaged in multi-dimensional research in the fields of Survey, Collection and Cultivation of Medicinal plants, Drug Standardisation, Drug Proving, Clinical Verification, Clinical Research, Fundamental and Basic Research in Homoeopathic system of medicine to make homoeopathy more plausible through evidence based research. Other activities include Documentation Publication, Health melas/ Exhibitions/ Arogya melas. As a public health initiative the Council has participated in National Programmes like Homoeopathy for Healthy Child and National Programme for prevention and control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS). The Council is operating through a network of 22 research institutes/ units and 4 independent extension units across the country. 8.3.2 SURVEY, COLLECTION AND CUL TIVATION OF MEDICINAL PLANTS CCRH is having its own Research Garden \" Survey of Medicinal Plants and Collection Unit\" (SMPCU) located at Emerald, Ooty, Nilgiri's District, Tamil Nadu, which is spread in 12.70 acres of land. This unit was specifically brought up for the collection and cultivation of the authentic Medicinal Plants of Homoeopathic use found in various regions of the Nation. Further, this unit is also conducting research 86 ANNUAL REPORT 2015-16work in maintaining the germplasm of the exotic medicinal plants used in homoeopathy. The authentic plant raw drug material whether cultivated or collected is supplied to the two Drug Standardization Centres of the Council located in Noida, U.P and in Hyderabad, Telangana State. As of now a total of 86 homoeopathic medicinal plants (71 exotic and 15 indigenous) are being cultivated in the research garden. Four (4) plants were supplied to the two DS centres of the Council for the Drug Standardization work and six (6) homoeopathic medicinal plants cultivated in the research garden were sold to the various Homoeopathic Pharmacies. 8.3.3 DRUG ST ANDARDIZATION Drug Standardization Unit of the Council was established in the year 1979 to lay down the standards for the quality of homoeopathic medicines. Drug Standardization studies ensure authenticity, purity, quality, safety and efficacy of the raw drugs as well as finished products used in Homoeopathy. It encompasses a number of parameters, which define the quality of homoeopathic drug and pharmaceutical uniformity. The two DS centres of the Council, Dr. D.P . Rastogi Central Research Institute for Homoeopathy, Noida and Drug Standardization Unit, Hyderabad has evaluated Pharmacognostic and Physico-chemical parameters of 5 (five) plant raw drug materials and Physico-chemical parameters of 5 (five) chemical raw drug materials. 8.3.4 DRUG PROVING The foundation of drug proving (human pathogenetic trial) is based on the action of drug substances on the healthy human beings and eliciting the symptoms of the drug as compared to the gross toxicological symptoms evident from animal studies. These subjective and objective symptoms form the profile of the drug recorded in the HomoeopathicMateriaMedica . In Homoeopathy, sub-material or ultra- molecular doses of potentially toxic or pathogenic substances commonly are used in pathogenetic trials on healthy human beings to produce symptoms which provide input for conducting clinical verification studies. The main objective is to elicit the pathogenetic response of a drug on apparently healthy human volunteers in homoeopathic potencies. The emphasis is laid on proving of drugs of indigenous origin and fragmentarily proved drugs whose standardization studies (Physico-chemical and Pharmacognostic parameters) have been completed. During the year proving of 07 drugs has been completed at following seven centers of the Council: 1. Central Research Institute (H), NOIDA (Uttar Pradesh) 2. Central Research Institute (H), Dr. Anjali Chatterjee Regional Research Institute (H),Kolkata (West Bengal) 5. Regional Research Institute (H), Gudivada (Andhra Pradesh) 6. Regional Research Institute (H), Navi Mumbai 7. Drug proving Research Unit, Extension Unit of Regional Research Institute (H), Puri at 87 ANNUAL REPORT 2015-16Dr. A. C. Homoeopathic Medical College & Hospital, Bhubaneswar (Orissa) 8.3.5 CLINICAL VERIFICATION The symptomatic data obtained by the process of Drug proving needs to be clinically verified before it is included in the homoeopathic Materia Medica. The Council had undertaken the clinical verification programme to clinically verify pathogenetic effects (symptoms) of 85 drugs, including those proved by the Council. Studies on these drugs have already been concluded and out of these 52 drugs have been published in the form of a Materia Medica in the name of \"Study of Homoeopathic Medicines through Clinical Verification - A new perspective\" in two volumes. Materia Medica volume III, containing 20 drugs has already been completed and is under publication. The study on 16 drugs is ongoing. The compilation work for Materia Medica volume IV is under progress. 8.3.6 CLINICAL RESEARCH Clinical Research is the core area of homoe opathic research. Council has conducted long-term observational studies, evidence based observational studies so far. Presently, Council is also conducting studies on Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT)/ design, apart from observational studies. The Council has taken up time bound studies with pre-defined outcome parameters based upon rigorously designed scientific protocols. The protocols are developed in consultation with the experts in respective fields from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) and eminent homeopathic educators and researchers.

NATIONAL MEDICINAL PLANTS BOARD (NMPB) 9.1 INTRODUCTION India has the unique distinction of possessing a substantial bio-diversity of medicinal plants, knowledge associated with their use and a good network of infrastructure required for their promotion, propagation etc. Indian systems of medicine use various raw materials and medicinal plants constitute 90% of it. About 3000 plants species are reported to be used in the codified Indian Systems of medicines like Ayurveda (900 species), Siddha (800 species), Unani (700 species) and Amchi (300 species). The rest of the species are used in local health traditions and in folk systems of medicine. Medicinal plants thus constitute an important component of the plant resource wealth of our country. In addition to their use in the preparation of Tradition medicines, the medicinal plants are being used in preparation of various pharmaceuticals and health products under the modern medicine system. Keeping in view, the need for availability of authentic raw drugs, the vast potential of herbal product/herbal drugs and the role India could play in the global market, Government of India has taken the lead by establishing National Medicinal Plants Board (NMPB) under Ministry of AYUSH, Government of India. NMPB is an apex national body which coordinates all matters relating to medicinal plants in the country. 9.2 VISION ST ATEMENT To tap the potential and comparative advantage of India in the medicinal plants sector so that it can realise its potential of Global Leadership in this field by comprehensive development of conservation, cultivation, collection, processing, marketing, research and extension support system for the sector. 9.3 STRENGTHS OF INDIA IN THE MEDICINAL PLANTS SECTOR l Resource Base: With its 15 Agro- Climatic zones and 16 Forest Types, India is home to 7% of the world's bio-diversity making it one of the 17 mega bio-diversity rich countries in the world.
