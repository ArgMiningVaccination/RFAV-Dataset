Other foods high in vitamin B6 include cold-water fish, lean chicken breast, chickpeas and potatoes. Do not get prebiotics mixed up with probiotics. Prebiotics serve as food for probiotics. Good sources include: garlic, leeks, and onions. Almonds Almonds, hazelnuts, peanuts and sunflower seeds provide needed vitamin E - an important antioxidant - to the body. If you need a healthy snack, consider raw or roasted almonds as an option. Also, cashews are rich in zinc, which powers your immune system by activating T-lymphocytes. Carrots Carrots and other fruits and vegetables high in carotenoids help support immune system function. Carotenoids turn into vitamin A in the body and provide an antioxidant effect. Other foods with carotenoids include sweet potatoes, pumpkin, squash and cantaloupe. Stock the fridge and indulge in immune system boosting soups and more!

Certain habits, such as smoking or drinking alcohol, may undermine your immune system health.
