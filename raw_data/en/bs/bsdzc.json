To understand immunization service interruptions specifically for maternal, neonatal and infant vaccines, we captured the local experiences of members of the Immunising Pregnant Women and Infants Network (IMPRINT) by conducting an online survey over 2-weeks in April 2020. IMPRINT is a global network of clinicians and scientists working in maternal and neonatal vaccinology. The survey included discrete questions to quantify the extent of disruption as well as free-text options to explore the reasons behind reported disruptions. Of the 48 responses received, the majority (75%) were from low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Of all respondents, 50% or more reported issues with vaccine delivery within their country. Thematic analysis identified three key themes behind immunization disruption: \"access\" issues, e.g., logistical barriers, \"provider\" issues, e.g., staff shortages and user \"concern\" about attending immunization appointments due to COVID-19 fear. Access and provider issues were more commonly reported by LMIC respondents. Overall, respondents reported uncertainty among parents and healthcare providers regarding routine immunization. We conclude that further quantification of routine vaccination disruption is needed, alongside health service prioritization, logistical support and targeted communication strategies to reinforce routine immunizations during the COVID-19 response.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2020-09-22", "cleaned_text": "Impact of COVID-19 on Immunization Services for Maternal and Infant Vaccines: Results of a Survey Conducted by Imprint\u2014The Immunising Pregnant Women and Infants Network [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8030556](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8030556) Risk factors for adverse outcomes had already been established [ [2](#B2-vaccines-08-00556), [3](#B3-vaccines-08-00556)] with healthy women of childbearing age, newborn babies and infants generally considered to be less severely affected by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) than other age groups [ [4](#B4-vaccines-08-00556), [5](#B5-vaccines-08-00556)]. However, as the pandemic has progressed, the associated disruption of public services has caused significant collateral damage with particular implications for maternal and child health [ [6](#B6-vaccines-08-00556), [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00556)]. [8](#B8-vaccines-08-00556), [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00556)], although the consequences are yet to be systematically evaluated. Finding the balance between guarding against the spread of COVID-19 versus controlling well known preventable diseases has proven to be delicate and difficult. For instance, recent modelling has predicted that not maintaining routine childhood immunization in Africa will lead to more deaths than possible COVID-19 deaths associated with visits to vaccination clinics [ [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00556)]. The World Health Organisation (WHO), in conjunction with UNICEF, GAVI and the Sabin Vaccine Institute, has undertaken two online immunization \"pulse\" surveys. The first of over 800 national and subnational immunization experts, completed in April 2020, focused on understanding the disruption caused by COVID-19 to routine delivery of the expanded programme on immunization and mass vaccination campaigns [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00556), [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00556)]. The second, published in June 2020, after our own survey was completed, also aimed to understand the extent of disruption, although it had fewer respondents [ [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00556)]. Based on their first survey, the WHO warned that COVID-19 was beginning to disrupt life-saving immunization services around the world, putting millions of children\u2014in rich and poor countries alike\u2014at risk of diseases such as diphtheria, measles and polio [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00556)]. By the end of May, mass vaccination campaigns against measles were beginning to be cancelled in some countries for fear of contracting COVID-19 when visiting health services [ [14](#B14-vaccines-08-00556), [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00556)]. The ability to deliver routine vaccines will also have been affected by redeployment of healthcare workers to tackle COVID-19. [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00556)]. Given the special interests of IMPRINT, our survey had a specific focus on immunization services for pregnant women and newborns, but also included questions on routine infant and toddler vaccination schedules. With its 290 members based in 51 countries worldwide, this network provided a unique forum to collate personal insights into the \"collateral damage\" caused by COVID-19, specifically related to the delivery of local and national immunizations, allowing us to further compare the situation in high income (HICs) versus low and middle income countries (LMICs). 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design and Participants [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00556)]. The questionnaire was distributed via an electronic link to all email addresses stored in the encrypted, secure IMPRINT membership database. A brief explanation of the purpose of the study and assurance of the confidentiality of the data was outlined in the body of the email. The survey was available for completion from 15 April 2020 to 30 April 2020, with a second reminder email sent four days before the survey closed. There were no specific eligibility criteria but only one submission per participant was permitted. 2.2. Survey Description [Section 4](#sec4-vaccines-08-00556)and [Section 5](#sec5-vaccines-08-00556)included questions inviting participants to provide a further free-text response. Progression to the next set of questions was not possible before answers to all the preceding questions had been registered. [Supplementary Materials](#app1-vaccines-08-00556). 2.3. Survey Validation 2.4. Ethics Approval and Data Management [18](#B18-vaccines-08-00556), [19](#B19-vaccines-08-00556)]. Email addresses were given by survey respondents, although any identifiable data was anonymised for the data analysis (undertaken in Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). Members of the IMPRINT network automatically consent to sharing contact details, such as email addresses, with the other members when joining the network; this is a core element of the network enabling fruitful communication and collaboration. Details can be found on the IMPRINT website, [https://www.imprint-network.co.uk](https://www.imprint-network.co.uk)[ [16](#B16-vaccines-08-00556)]. 2.5. Survey Analysis: Quantitative [17](#B17-vaccines-08-00556)]. [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00556)], then they were included in the analysis. Answers were recoded if they were different from healthcare providers' answers in the same country and did not correlate with the published country schedules. No qualitative free-text responses were amended. Survey Analysis: Qualitative [21](#B21-vaccines-08-00556)], through a phenomenological lens. This strategy has been used effectively in previous qualitative or mixed-methods studies that have similarly analysed free-text comments from surveys [ [22](#B22-vaccines-08-00556), [23](#B23-vaccines-08-00556)]. A traditional content analytical [ [24](#B24-vaccines-08-00556)] approach (including word and phrase repetitions) was applied to identify common issues to maternal, neonatal and infant/toddler vaccination delivery and key patterns across settings. Having discussed these issues and come to a group consensus, the authors thereby developed a framework of three overarching themes from the free-text responses. The data was subsequently reanalysed to identify further associated subthemes. Based on these themes (both primary and subthemes), the free-text answers were re-reviewed a final time and categorised according to the immunization type (maternal, neonatal and infant/toddler) or country of origin (HICs versus LMICs). Different versions of the framework were shared between the authors multiple times, ensuring that the final framework was representative of all respondents' answers within the three identified key themes. Example quotes from respondents were assigned to the different subthemes to substantiate the findings. [25](#B25-vaccines-08-00556)]. 3. Results 3.1. Quantitative Findings 3.1.1. Participants [Table 1](#vaccines-08-00556-t001)). They were reporting from a range of countries, with the majority from LMICs (75%); answers were received from 36 members based in 13 LMICs and 12 members based in 5 HICs. Please refer to [Supplementary Materials, Table S1](#app1-vaccines-08-00556), for a breakdown of respondents' occupations by country-of-origin. The official numbers of COVID-19 cases at the time of the survey in each country varied across settings ( [Figure 1](#vaccines-08-00556-f001)). 3.1.2. Routine Vaccine Schedules and Delivery Locations Prior to COVID-19 [26](#B26-vaccines-08-00556)]. Despite being recommended by the WHO for antenatal use worldwide, influenza and pertussis vaccines were mainly reported to be part of antenatal schedules in HICs, with the exception of South Africa, India and Costa Rica (although predominantly facilitated in the private sector). Maternal immunizations were reported to be primarily administered by midwives, nurses or doctors in antenatal clinics, across all settings. [20](#B20-vaccines-08-00556)]. In LMICs, both neonate and infant vaccines were reported to be primarily delivered through an expanded programme on immunization (EPI) clinics, whilst infant and toddler vaccines in HICs were provided mainly through family doctors or paediatricians. 3.1.3. Changes to Vaccine Delivery since the COVID-19 Pandemic [Table 2](#vaccines-08-00556-t002)); this was a problem identified similarly across both LMICs and HICs. Issues with the delivery of vaccines to newborns were described by 33% (n = 16) of all survey respondents, though this was higher among those based in LMICs (42%, n = 15). Among those respondents who did not describe any issues, a proportion chose the answer \"Don't know\" for whether they knew if immunization services were disrupted, including 9, 8 and 6 respondents in the context of maternal, newborn and infant/childhood vaccine delivery, respectively. 3.2. Qualitative Findings 3.2.1. Issues around Vaccine Delivery and Uptake [Figure 2](#vaccines-08-00556-f002)). [Figure 2](#vaccines-08-00556-f002)). 3.2.2. Regional, National and International Recommendations and Guidelines [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00556)], with some answers describing how their governments had adapted these recommendations accordingly to their setting. Sub-Saharan African participants, for example, specifically pointed out \"the application of social distancing and hygiene at immunization sessions as well as scheduling of sessions with few persons to prevent overcrowding\" (Nigeria) and encouragement for the \"widespread use of facial mask and hand sanitizers in public places\" (Cameroon). Similarly, a Nepalese participant described a statement by their Ministry of Health encouraging routine immunization services to continue: \"To Maintain Social Distancing, To identify any contraindications to vaccination, PPE provision to Vaccinator\". Only one LMIC respondent (India), however, cited a specific national or regional guideline [ [28](#B28-vaccines-08-00556)]. [29](#B29-vaccines-08-00556)] as well as national guidelines or official documents issued by their government, including in the UK [ [30](#B30-vaccines-08-00556), [31](#B31-vaccines-08-00556)] and Canada [ [32](#B32-vaccines-08-00556), [33](#B33-vaccines-08-00556)]. The Canadian guideline was released early in the course of the pandemic and specifically described prioritization of vaccines, with the highest importance placed on routine immunizations in infants under 6 months of age. Respondents from the UK also cited guidelines or statements released by professional bodies, including the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for antenatal and postnatal services (although specific vaccines are not mentioned) [ [34](#B34-vaccines-08-00556)], Royal College of Paediatric and Child Health [ [35](#B35-vaccines-08-00556)], Royal College of Nurses [ [36](#B36-vaccines-08-00556)] and Royal College of General Practitioners [ [37](#B37-vaccines-08-00556)], all of whom issued advice urging continuation of national immunization campaigns. [38](#B38-vaccines-08-00556)]. No similar examples of parental communication were provided by LMIC respondents. 4. Discussion [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00556)]. [8](#B8-vaccines-08-00556), [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00556)]. Our stakeholder survey included both HICs and LMICs and found that more than half of respondents reported disruption in routine maternal and childhood vaccination programmes. This is consistent with the World Health Organisation's (WHO) first online immunization survey of over 800 immunization experts, including representatives of Health Ministries and global health organizations from over 100 countries, which reported that over 50% of the expanded programme on immunization programmes had been disrupted [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00556), [12](#B12-vaccines-08-00556)]. The repeat WHO survey conducted in June 2020 found that immunization programme disruption remained an issue for the majority of respondents [ [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00556)]. Similarly, in recent correspondence from Pakistan, one of the only published reports providing this level of detailed data in a LMIC, the average number of daily immunization visits (accounting for all antigens) are reported to have decreased by more than half during the lockdown compared with baseline, with the steepest decline at the start of the pandemic in Pakistan in April 2020 [ [39](#B39-vaccines-08-00556)]. There is also growing evidence from England, Scotland and the United States that the COVID-19 pandemic response has caused vaccination rates to decline even within HICs [ [40](#B40-vaccines-08-00556), [41](#B41-vaccines-08-00556), [42](#B42-vaccines-08-00556)]. [13](#B13-vaccines-08-00556)]. Moreover, it conveys the concerns of stakeholders from LMICs, specifically Sub-Saharan African, representing 75% and 65% of the total participants, respectively. This has enabled us to explore potential differences between HICs and LMICs. Although several studies have emerged modelling the trajectory of the outbreak in African countries [ [43](#B43-vaccines-08-00556)], the voice of health care providers and governing bodies in these settings has been less audible and there is a distinct lack of large-scale data or more granular evidence from national immunization programmes. This may be because, to date, the epicentre of the pandemic has primarily been within Asia, Europe and the Americas, with lower case numbers within Sub-Saharan African countries, with the exception of South Africa. As the epidemiology shows, however, the pandemic is still evolving and cases in sub-Saharan Africa are increasing daily [ [1](#B1-vaccines-08-00556)]. Finally, our survey is unique in reporting issues not only around delivery of the infant expanded programme on immunization vaccines but also extending to immunization services for pregnant women, providing insights into the provision of antenatal care where these vaccines might be administered. Pregnant women represent a vulnerable group, often overlooked during epidemics, as recently seen during the Ebola outbreak [ [44](#B44-vaccines-08-00556)]. [45](#B45-vaccines-08-00556)]. More specifically, the WHO survey outlined the contribution of: (1) parental reluctance to leave home due to restrictions on movement, a lack of information or fear of COVID-19, (2) poor availability of health workers due to travel restrictions, lack of PPE and redeployment to pandemic response duties and (3) transport delays and problems getting vaccine supplies to clinics [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00556)]. These themes are entirely in keeping with our results. [45](#B45-vaccines-08-00556)]. [7](#B7-vaccines-08-00556), [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00556)]. At least 80 million children under the age of one are estimated to be at risk from vaccine preventable diseases due to missing out of routine immunizations [ [11](#B11-vaccines-08-00556)] with measles a particular concern [ [15](#B15-vaccines-08-00556)]. Previous infectious disease outbreaks (including Ebola) were also associated with increased cases of vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles [ [46](#B46-vaccines-08-00556)]. In the recent outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, three times as many people died from measles than from Ebola [ [47](#B47-vaccines-08-00556)]. Moreover, lockdown has exposed and exacerbated existing immunization inequities and uptake barriers, both within and between different countries [ [9](#B9-vaccines-08-00556)]. A recent detailed benefit-risk analysis, modelling the impact of missed childhood vaccinations in Africa, found that the benefit of averting vaccine-preventable infections far outweighed any possible COVID-19 morbidity and mortality associated with immunization clinic visits [ [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00556)]. [Figure 2](#vaccines-08-00556-f002)B being from the UK. A further limitation is that the overall response rate from the IMPRINT network was quite low (17%), although this is likely due to the limited time period given to respond, in order to primarily capture the initial concerns and attitudes towards vaccine delivery, as a \"snapshot\" at the start of the pandemic. Further surveys would benefit from involving more grass-roots participants based in different locations, including a comparison of rural versus urban settings. Nevertheless, our survey represented 18 nationalities worldwide, across 5 continents, and included a range of stakeholders, based in clinical, public health or research departments. Non-response bias could also have occurred in this study; important responses by participants from particular demographic groups, occupations or countries, or those too busy to respond, could be missing and therefore their views are not accounted for within the results. It is also possible that those who responded were biased towards having noticed changes, whilst others who felt that all had remained the same were possibly less likely to engage in the questionnaire. Further research is also needed to quantify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of routine immunizations worldwide to enable catch up programmes to be planned. However, the ability to assess this rapidly will vary by location based on the routine immunization data collection systems available. [1](#B1-vaccines-08-00556)]. This repeat survey will aim to increase the response rate, particularly from countries now at the epicentre of the pandemic, and to explore further how to manage the challenges of immunization disruption. The epicentre has currently shifted to South America (Brazil) and, therefore, it would have been too early to capture the key issues, concerns and experiences of these countries with this initial survey [ [1](#B1-vaccines-08-00556)]. Moreover, some areas in Sub-Saharan African are now seeing a significant increase in COVID-19 cases [ [43](#B43-vaccines-08-00556)], which might lead to further changes in routine immunization services; on the other hand, other countries may have established effective mitigation strategies, after initially responding by downgrading services for fear of a rising epidemic, which, to date, has not materialised. Finally, it would be important to assess if lessons have been learned, further recommendations or guidelines have been published at the national or local level (or alterations to the existing ones) and the implementation of novel strategies has helped to overcome identified barriers. 5. Conclusions [10](#B10-vaccines-08-00556)], is needed to understand the benefits of attending immunization appointments versus COVID-19 transmission risk. To address the current uncertainty reflected by this short study and experienced by healthcare providers, clearer and more tailored communication is urgently needed [ [8](#B8-vaccines-08-00556)], particularly for LMICs. Improved efforts in communicating policies and conveying key messages should be targeted at pregnant women and parents, emphasizing the importance of attending routine vaccination services, despite the COVID-19 pandemic response. This is imperative for all settings, although our findings suggest there has been less official information provided for parents based in LMICs. Potential strategies in these settings may also need to focus on more community engagement to improve immunization uptake [ [48](#B48-vaccines-08-00556)]. Accurate and up-to-date advice can be delivered using more user-friendly approaches, for example via social media, given the importance of accurate online messaging during the pandemic [ [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00556)]. Effective communication strategies would serve to tackle misinformation, which has, unfortunately, been a worldwide concern during the pandemic [ [49](#B49-vaccines-08-00556), [50](#B50-vaccines-08-00556)]. Within our survey, \"vaccine acceptance/conspiracy theories/anti-vaxx sentiments\" were brought up more frequently by LMICs, specifically Sub-Saharan African countries (although not uniformly across settings). This may be consistent with the wave of vaccine hesitancy [ [47](#B47-vaccines-08-00556)] and broader mistrust currently spreading across this region, with regards to both COVID-19 illness and potential COVID-19 vaccine trials to be undertaken in the future [ [51](#B51-vaccines-08-00556)]. To date, the pandemic has largely been interpreted as an imported problem. This perception has in some places hampered acceptance of preventative measures [ [52](#B52-vaccines-08-00556)] and might impact on future immunization campaigns, if a vaccine is tested and finally introduced. [32](#B32-vaccines-08-00556), [33](#B33-vaccines-08-00556), [53](#B53-vaccines-08-00556)]. Midway during the pandemic, WHO also published a framework for governments to guide the conduct of vaccination campaigns [ [27](#B27-vaccines-08-00556)]. This includes the importance of risk assessing the likelihood of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases alongside the current transmission of COVID-19. General efforts explaining the safety measures implemented need to be communicated, in combination with the message that vaccination matters and saves lives, pandemic or not. [37](#B37-vaccines-08-00556), [54](#B54-vaccines-08-00556)]. Alternative vaccination delivery mechanisms such as utilising pharmacies may also need to be considered [ [55](#B55-vaccines-08-00556)]. More innovative examples include the development of drive-by or mobile clinics [ [56](#B56-vaccines-08-00556)]; reassigning existing locations to facilitate vaccine delivery e.g., maternal antenatal clinics moved to the local football stadium, as described by one respondent, thereby overcoming issues with overcrowding and enabling social distancing; and a trial of \"trace and immunise\" systems (particularly using a digital interface) [ [39](#B39-vaccines-08-00556)].
