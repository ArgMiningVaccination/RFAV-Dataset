A Medical Intuitive can read and provide valuable information regarding deficiencies, diseases, imbalances, energy blockages or weakness in the physical body. Medical intuition is the knowing about physical issues in the body and the underlying causes, negative patterns and life experiences that may contribute to the development of physical symptoms. Early detection of imbalances may even prevent diseases from developing. Other terms for such a person include medical clairvoyant, medical psychic or intuitive counselor. We are all born with intuition, however, over time we learn to disregard this ability instead of building it to be a valuable tool for life. A medical intuitive has developed their intuitive skills to a degree that allows them access to information beyond the physical plane of our daily existence and therefore allowing us the opportunity to enhance our understanding of our interconnection to all life energy and truth. A Special Note from Silvia: From the clients I have seen in the past two years, I have observed two main underlying health patterns: 1.) Almost all of them have had a moderate - severe heavy metal toxicity that was the underlying cause of most of their illnesses (that they were struggling with for years). I also often noticed chemical, pesticide and neurotoxins harming the organs, nervous system, emotional body and/or the brain. I have noticed in many of my clients, many of whom tried many paths of healing, including chelation therapy or the intake of spirulina or chlorella are still are left with many harmful toxins in their body. The toxins are often in the deeper levels of the organs and fat tissue so most healing methods are unable to reach them successfully. Through medical intuition - which is a tuning into the energetic information in the body, I am guided from the human body to provide the most simplest and direct steps to open the lymphatic system, liver, spleen and kidneys so that the toxins are removed successfully. The key is utilizing a series of stages to reach into all layers of the body The energy work is also supported with diet and super food recommendations and homeopathic remedies. 2.) The second problem that I find often are parasites, fungus and yeast living in a weakened body causing harmful toxicity and inflammation. I am able to tune into and provide relief of the specific parasite through the same medical intuitive process. Health and wellness is possible in a relatively short time. It may take 1-6 months, depending on the severity of the toxicity to work its way through the body to regain a balanced internal environment. After years of accumulated toxicity, clients regain their health and vitality and a new level of self-care and education in the underlying core areas of their health and well-being. Once you identify the cause of your symptoms it is easy to shift your level of awareness from confusion and frustration to knowing how to take care of your body and heal at a complete and deep level of your being. As a medical intuitive, I have come to understand that all symptoms have a deeper purpose and can teach clients a great deal about how to manage their well-being for greater empowerment in their lives. The body is the temple for our soul so we can express our essence to its full possibility in our lives. Illness can open us up to reach deeper and higher grounds in our lives so we may make the greatest contribution to life while we are here. If you are reading this, and it touches you, you are ready to move to a greater understanding and move toward inner alignment and true, lasting healing. Much Love Silvia.

You simply saved my life. I had such tremendous turn of events in my health that no one seemed to put a connection to. From high heart rates, severe anxiety and so on, I became almost non functional. Went to the emergency 8 times in 1 month, doctors advising I was fine and it was simply anxiety was a very fearful time in my life. Then I met you and all changed. You were able to distinguish exactly what was happening, help me heal through it with the exact right supplements and foods and not only that but for the right amounts my body could handle. I freed myself from a severe mercury levels in my body to the better health I ever had in my life today. So thank you again for your wonderful work and I would recommend you to everyone I know as I know they will be in their best possible hands and on a wonderful healing journey.\" - Angele Miller, New Brunswick, Canada \"When I first found and met Silvia, I was dealing with what I thought were thyroid issues, ever-increasing food sensitivities, consistently low energy, and generally always feeling unwell. She discovered that all of my health issues were mostly stemming from just one cause physically - heavy metal poisoning. Not only was Silvia glad I had found her because of how imminently dangerous and life-threatening my situation had become, she was also able to help me clear and heal - both with her amazingly powerful energy work and the homeopathic, diet, and lifestyle remedies she prescribed - all of the heavy metal toxicity and other forms of toxicity my body had gained due to being compromised for so long, allowing my body to begin profound healing in a remarkably short amount of time, and surprisingly little side effects or suffering. In the first and subsequent sessions, Silvia also helped me to navigate myself through profound mental and emotional healing , as she deeply understands how all of these are connected. Spiritually she has helped me to take myself deep into my highest self and essence and truly feel the connection and knowing that is available there. The high and deep levels from which Silvia tunes in and connects make her sessions immeasurably thorough and complete for all levels of the being.\" Kelsey Braden Westvelt, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada \"I've had 2 private healing sessions with Silvia so far, one 3 years ago and one a few weeks ago, and they were both Amazing. What she does and the speed at which she works always blows my mind. It's 10 times faster than any other form of muscle testing. She can instantly ask the body what the problem is, what's hard for it, what it needs, what it lacks, etc. including what foods are good and not good for you at this moment, and receive instant answers. It's like she reading the Akashic Records of your body! Going through the traditional medical system is very tedious and time consuming, you wait for long periods of time just to get your appointment, then to get the results, often times they don't even find out what the issue is, and if they do they give you medicine to treat the symptoms, NOT to heal the cause like Silvia does. But what Silvia does goes way beyond muscle testing and getting answers from the body, she can also speak directly to your Emotional Body (your Subconscious mind) and your Soul and receive messages that are important for you hear now and it is So Very helpful. In my first session 3 years ago I even asked Silvia for the meaning of 10 years' worth of dreams (nightmares) with the same recurring theme. I didn't understand them and it was driving me crazy. It took her less than 5 seconds to get the answer and once I understood the meaning, the dreams never came back! What a relief. Amazing. I had a lot of skin problems and Silvia saw that I had some parasites in my body. Not only could she name them specifically (with very long names that were hard to pronounce) she could see where they were located in the body! She just thought it was strange that I had that particular kind as they were mostly common in Europe, but at the time she didn't know I am from Europe so it was not so strange after all! And they were completely healed with her homeopathic remedies in less than 2 months. I know because she checked. She doesn't miss a thing. In short, Silvia takes all the guesswork out of the equation regarding your health, both physically, emotionally, and mentally so you can start working on healing, feeling better, and enjoy life at a much higher level than before. What's more is that Silvia is also a Life Coach, and a Very Good one at that. Silvia can also clear many toxins out of your body energetically (and long distance). And if that wasn't enough she can also heal and clear Deep Grief, inherited depression from your ancestors, and much more, and depression also shows up when the body is out of balance and struggling, but no one tells you this. I felt the emotional clearing So Very strongly in my heart, and I have often not felt anything in energetic healing sessions with other healers. Know that you may feel quite tired for a few days after as your Mind-Body resets and recalibrates, but that is to be expected. All you need to do is give yourself extra rest and listen to your body's needs. The body need time to heal and regain it new Set Point. 2 My experience of the emotional healing part: For as long as I can remember tearing up just at the thought of something sad and the loss of someone dear, was the easiest thing for me and instant. Being sad and feeling heavy in my heart felt common and familiar... But now after the energetic healing session with Silvia, I can think of the loved ones I have lost with a smile and without tearing up and feeling heavy in my heart.... I never could before... Depression, sadness and grief at a deep level runs in many families and generations, but it doesn't mean that we have to carry it forward into our lives. IT CAN BE HEALED. I can't recommend and thank Silvia enough for everything she has done for me, I feel so much better now even before starting on my naturopathic remedies. Can't wait to see how great I feel after taking them. Thank you So Much Silvia, I am So Grateful to have met you and to receive your healing. Silvia dear you Really know what you are doing, Than you.\" With Love, Teresa De Simone, Edmonton, AB, Canada ANIMALS 30 mins |$190 I can detect and clear parasites, food allergies, emotional and mental traumas, weak organs, etc. with no additional tests or procedures needed, thus potentially saving you a lot of money in veterinary bills, and getting your much loved friend's health back in alignment with wellbeing, potentially in less time as well.
