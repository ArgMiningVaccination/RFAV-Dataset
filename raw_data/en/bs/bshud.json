Our goal is to balance the mind-body connection and promote overall well-being. Our Certified Ayurvedic Practitioner, Christianne Madrazo, offers a variety of services such as Ayurvedic healing treatments to cleanse the body and bring balance to your mind and body through Abhyanga, Shirodhara, and more. For immediate assistance, TEXT 619-637-0201. Ayurveda + Christianne have absolutely changed my life. I was struggling with fatigue, gut health, dry eyes, achey joints, etc. And also had dermatitis around my face and mouth and couldn't figure out how to heal it. After one visit with Christianne, she was able to get me on track with the correct diet for my Pitta dosha along with herbal supplements to support my detox. I felt better within 1-2 weeks of following her guidance - it was seriously MAGIC. I had energy again, all of my dermatitis went away, and I just felt alive for the first time in a long time. She has helped me to understand how foods and emotions affect the body and how to keep myself in balance. And she helped me to release some guilt/grief I had been storing for years. Ayurveda is very gentle and is a true mind and body detox. Would highly recommend Christianne!!
