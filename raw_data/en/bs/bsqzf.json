They therefore represent a signi cant contribution to the workload of respiratory physicians. Pleural disease originates from a wide range of pathologies and a systematic approach to the investigation and management is therefore required. These guidelines attempt to summarise the available evidence to aid the healthcare professional in delivering good quality patient care. NEED FOR GUIDELINE The Standards of Care Committee of the British Thoracic Society (BTS) established a Pleural Disease Guideline Group in December 2007. The objective was to produce an evidence-based update of the last pleural disease guidelines published in 2003. It was recognised that, since the last guideline, a number of good quality primary research papers have been published and the guidelines needed to re flect these new data. In addition, there was a need to develop new sections on local anaesthetic thoracoscopy and thoracic ultrasound to re flect changes in clinical practice. INTENDED USERS AND SCOPE OF THE GUIDELINE This guideline is intended for use by all healthcare professionals who may be involved in pleural disease management. This will include doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals. AREAS COVERED BY THIS GUIDELINE The guideline addresses the investigation and medical management of pleural disease in adults. This is divided into the following sections: 1. Investigation of a unilateral pleural effusion in adults. 2. Management of spontaneous pneumothorax. 3. Management of a malignant pleural effusion. 4. Management of pleural infection in adults. 5. Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy. 6. Chest drain insertion and thoracic ultrasound. The six sections can be downloaded individually from the website. Key points are repeated within sections to give users a full review of the individual documents without the need to cross reference repeatedly. In addition, at the end of this section (Annex 1) there is a list of good areas for audit and future research. AREAS NOT COVERED BY THIS GUIDELINE The following areas fall outside the scope of this guideline: 1. Paediatric pleural disease 2. Detail on thoracic surgical techniques 3. Management of bilateral pleural effusionsMETHODOLOGY Establishment of guideline team A Working Party was established with representa- tion from a range of professionals with an interest in pleural disease together with a lay representative (see full list of Guideline Group members at the end of this section). Scope of the guideline, PICOT questions and literature search The guidelines are based upon the best available evidence. The methodology followed the criteria as set out by the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation (AGREE) collaboration in the document the AGREE instrument available online at http://www.agreecollaboration.org/instrument/. The scope and purpose of the guideline had been agreed and de ned in consultation with all poten- tial stakeholders representing the medical and nursing professions, patient groups, health management and industry (see full list of stake- holders at the end of this section). Guideline members identi ed and formulated a set of key clinical questions in Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Time (PICOT) format to inform the search strategies for the literature search. The BTS commissioned the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York to undertake a bespoke literature search using the search strategies shown in detail on the BTS website (http://www.brit-thoracic.org.uk). The following databases were searched: Ovid MEDLINE (from 1960 onwards) (including MEDLINE In Process), Ovid EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDRS), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The initial searches were done in June 2008 and revised in September 2009. Searches were limited to English and adult literature; 19 425 potential papers were identi ed by the search. (see online appendix 1). The Guideline Committee agreed on the following criteria to select relevant abstracts for the guideline: 1. Studies that addressed the clinical question. 2. Appropriate study types used to produce the best evidence to answer the clinical question. 3. Non-English abstracts were not evaluated. 4. Abstracts were not rejected on the basis of the journal of publication, the country in which the research was done or published or the date of publication. A total of 17 393 abstracts were rejected through the criteria outlined above and 2032 full papers were ordered for critical appraisal.<Supplementary data are published online only.

Formal critical appraisal to assess the clinical relevance and scienti c rigor of 1441 papers was performed independently by at least two guideline reviewers using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) critical appraisal checklists (see online appendix 2). The guideline reviewers identi ed an additional 148 papers during the period of guideline development which were added and critically appraised. The evidence in each study was graded using the SIGN formulated levels of evidence (table 1). Considered judgement and grading of the evidence Evidence tables were produced to review the body of evidence and inform the considered judgements and grading of recom- mendations. Where there was a lack of evidence, consensus statements were derived by incorporating a number of indi- vidual non-biased expert opinions from experts in the eld. The following were considered in grading of the recommendations: 1. The available volume of evidence. 2. The applicability of the obtained evidence for making recommendations for the de ned target audience of this guideline. 3. How generalisable the obtained evidence was to the target population for the guideline. 4. A clear consistency in the evidence obtained to support recommendations. 5. The implications of recommendations on clinical practice in terms of recourses and skilled expertise. 6. In-depth cost-effectiveness analysis falls outside the scope of this guideline. Recommendations were graded from A+ to D as indicated by the strength of the evidence as listed in table 2. Drafting of the guideline The Guideline Group produced a draft guideline following regular email consultations and meetings held in December 2007, June 2008, November 2008, February 2009 and May 2009. The draft guideline was presented at the Summer BTS meeting in June 2009 and circulated to all the stakeholders identi ed (see below) for consultation and review. The revised draft guideline was submitted to the BTS Standards of Care Committee for review and published online for a month (in August 2009) to allow for BTS member and public consultation. All the feedback was reviewed and discussedby the Guideline Committee and incorporated into the revised draft guideline. The literature search was repeated by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York and additional evidence appraised and included in the nal draft of the guideline. PLANNED REVIEW OF THE GUIDELINE The guideline will be reviewed and updated in 4 years from publication.

CT/US guided pleural biopsy Thoracic Society pleural disease guideline 2010 Clare Hooper,1Y C Gary Lee,2Nick Maskell,3on behalf of the BTS Pleural Guideline Group INTRODUCTION Pleural effusions are a common medical problem with more than 50 recognised causes including disease local to the pleura or underlying lung, systemic conditions, organ dysfunction and drugs.1 Pleural effusions occur as a result of increased fluid formation and/or reduced fluid resorption. The precise pathophysiology of fluid accumulation varies according to underlying aetiologies. As the differential diagnosis for a unilateral pleural effu- sion is wide, a systematic approach to investigation is necessary. The aim is to establish a diagnosis swiftly while minimising unnecessary invasive investigations and facilitating treatment, avoiding the need for repeated therapeutic aspirations when possible. Since the 2003 guideline, several clinically rele- vant studies have been published, allowing new recommendations regarding image guidance of pleural procedures with clear bene ts to patient comfort and safety, optimum pleural fluid sampling and processing and the particular value of thor- acoscopic pleural biopsies. This guideline also includes a review of recent evidence for the use of new biomarkers including N-terminal pro-brain pleuritis. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND HISTORY <Aspiration should not be performed for bilateral effusions in a clinical setting strongly suggestive of a transudate unless there are atypical features or they fail to respond to therapy. ( U) <An accurate drug history should be taken during clinical assessment. ( U) The history and physical examination of a patient with a pleural effusion may guide the clinician as to whether the effusion is a transudate or an exudate. This critical distinction narrows the differential diagnosis and directs further investigation. Clinical assessment alone is often capable of identifying transudative effusions. Therefore, in an appropriate clinical setting such as left ventricular failure with a con rmatory chest x-ray, such effusions do not need to be sampled unless there are atypical features or they fail to respond to treatment. Approximately 75% of patients with pulmonary embolism and pleural effusion have a history of pleuritic pain. These effusions tend to occupy less than one-third of the hemithorax and the dyspnoeais often out of proportion to the size of the effu- sion.23As tests on the pleural fluid are unhelpful in diagnosing pulmonary embolism, a high index of suspicion is required to avoid missing the diagnosis. The patient 's drug history is also important. Although uncommon, a number of medications have been reported to cause exudative pleural effusions (box 1). Useful resources for more detailed information include the British National Formulary and the web site http://www.pneumotox.com/. An occupational history including details about known or suspected asbestos exposure and poten- tial secondary exposure via parents or spouses should be documented. An algorithm for the iinvestigation of a unilateral pleural effusion is shown in gure 1. INITIAL DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING Plain radiography <Posteroanterior (PA) chest x-rays should be performed in the assessment of suspected pleural effusion .(U) The plain chest radiographic features of pleural effusion are usually characteristic. The poster- oanterior (PA) chest x-ray is abnormal in the pres- ence of about 200 ml of pleural fluid. However, only 50 ml of pleural fluid can produce detectable posterior costophrenic angle blunting on a lateral chest x-ray.4 In the intensive care setting, most chest x-rays are performed as AP supine examinations, resulting in free pleural fluid lying posteriorly in the depen- dent portion of the chest. Consequently, effusions are seen as an increase in hemithorax opacity with preserved vascular shadows on the supine x-ray. Other signs include the loss of the sharp silhouette of the ipsilateral hemidiaphragm and fluid tracking Box 1 Commonly prescribed drugs known to cause pleural effusions (over 100 2Lung Institute of Western Australia, University Dept Med, Perth, Western Australia, Australia 3Department of Clinical Sciences, Southmead Hospital, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK Correspondence to Nick Maskell, Academic Respiratory Unit, Department of Clinical Sciences, Southmead Hospital, University of Bristol, BS10 5NB; nick.maskell@bristol.ac.uk Received 12 February 2010 2010; 65(Suppl horizontal ssures resulting in apparent ssural thickening. The volume of pleural fluid is commonly underestimated on a supine chest x-ray and 'normal ' appearances do not exclude the presence of an effusion.5 Subpulmonic effusions occur when pleural fluid accumulates between the diaphragmatic surface of the lung and the diaphragm. They are often transudates, can be dif cult to diagnose on the PA lm and may require an ultrasound scan. The PAlm will often show a lateral peaking of an apparently raised hemidiaphragm which has a steep lateral slope with a gradual medial slope (see gure 2). The lateral x-ray may have a flat appearance of the posterior aspect of the hemidiaphragm with a steep downward slope at the major ssure.6 Ultrasound <Bedside ultrasound guidance signi cantly increases the likelihood of successful pleural fluid aspiration and reduces the risk of organ puncture. (B)<Ultrasound detects pleural fluid septations with greater sensitivity than CT . (C) Ultrasound guidance improves the rate of successful pleural aspiration. Several studies have shown that fluid can be successfully obtained using ultrasound in up to 88% of patients after a failed clinical and plain chest x-ray-guided attempt.7e9 Ultrasound guidance reduces the incidence of iatrogenic pneumothorax following thoracentesis and several studies have shown this effect to be independent of the size of the effusion.1011 This bene t appears to be lost when the 'X marks the spot ' method is employed, presumably due to differences in patient positioning between the ultrasound and the procedure.12 Clinical judgement with review of the chest x-ray was compared with ultrasonography in planning the diagnostic aspiration site in a prospective study including 255 clinician assessments of 67 patients.4The sensitivity and speci city of clinical judgement compared with the gold standard of ultra- sound was 76.6% and 60.3%, respectively. Ultrasound increasedFigure 1 Diagnostic algorithm for the investigation of a unilateral pleural effusion.

Ultrasound is superior to plain radiography in diagnosing and quantifying pleural effusions and distinguishes pleural fluid from thickening with high speci city, particularly when colour Doppler is employed.13e16It is particularly useful in the diag- nosis of small effusions or in recumbent patients (eg, ventilated and critically ill) due to the low sensitivity of plain radiography in these situations. The diagnostic role of thoracic ultrasound in the early inves- tigation of pleural effusions extends beyond the identi cation and safe aspiration of fluid. Ultrasound detects septations within pleural fluid with greater sensitivity than CT scanning.17A septated appearance may be observed in malignant effusions or pleural infection and occurs with similar frequency in the two diagnoses.18 Ultrasound positively identi es exudative effusions when pleural complex, simple (anechoic) effusions can be exudates or transudates.19 Ultrasound features can distinguish malignant from benign effusions. Qureshi et al demonstrated 95% speci for diaphragmatic nodules as visualised on ultrasound examination.20Overall sensitivity of ultrasound in the differentiation of malignant from benign effusions was 79% (95% CI 61% (89%). ASPIRATION <A diagnostic sample should be aspirated with a ne-bore (21G) needle and a 50 ml syringe. ( U) <Bedside ultrasound guidance improves the success rate and reduces complications (including pneumothorax) and is therefore recommended for diagnostic aspira- tions. (B) <Pleural fluid should always be sent for protein, lactate dehydrogenase, Gram stain, cytology and microbiolog- ical culture. (C) This is the primary means of evaluating pleural fluid and its ndings are used to guide further investigation. Pleural ultrasound should be used at the bedside to select a pleural aspiration site with safety. Ultrasound increases the chances of successful aspiration and minimises the need for repeated attempts.21Direct ultrasound-guided aspiration or ultrasound at the bedside immediately before the procedure is preferable to the 'X marks the spot 'approach. A lateral site is preferred, provided that adequate fluid is demonstrated here on ultrasound as the risk of intercostal vessel trauma increases with more posterior or medial punctures (see gure 3). Patient consent and further technical details of pleural aspiration are covered in the guideline on pleural procedures. T able 1 shows sample collection guidance for speci c pleural fluid tests. A green needle (21G) and 50 ml syringe are adequate for diag- nostic pleural aspirations. If there is diagnostic suspicion of pleural infection and a pleural fluid pH is to be measured, aspi- rated fluid should immediately be drawn into a heparinised blood gas syringe which should then be capped while awaiting analysis to avoid exposure of the fluid to the air. The remaining sample should be divided between sample pots for microbiological (5 ml), biochemical (2 e5 ml) and cytological (remaining sample which should be 20 e40 ml) analysis. Microscopic examination of Gram- stained pleural fluid sediment is necessary for all pleural fluid samples. If infection is suspected, some of the pleural fluid should be sent in blood culture bottles which increases diagnostic accuracy, particularly for anaerobic organisms.22 Figure 2 Chest x-ray showing a moderate left pleural effusion and subpulmonic effusion on the right (a).

At room temperature the sample for cytology should be sent to the laboratory as quickly as possible but, if a delay is anticipated, the specimen can be refrigerated at 4 8C for up to 14 days with no deterioration in the diagnostic yield for malignancy (table 1).25 Appearance <The appearance of the pleural fluid and any odour should be recorded. ( U) <A pleural fluid haematocrit is helpful in the diagnosis of haemothorax .(U) T able 2 summarises the appearance of pleural effusions due to speci c Fluid may appear blood-tinged, franklybloody or purulent. Centrifuging turbid or milky pleural fluid will distinguish between empyema and lipid effusions. If the supernatant is clear, the turbid fluid was due to cell debris and empyema is likely while, if it is still turbid, chylothorax or pseudochylothorax are likely.26The unpleasant smell of anaer- obic infection may guide antibiotic choices and the smell of ammonia suggests urinothorax. Grossly bloody pleural fluid is usually due to malignancy, pulmonary embolus with infarction, trauma, benign asbestos pleural effusions or post-cardiac injury syndrome.2728 A haemothorax can be distinguished from other blood-stained effusions by performing a haematocrit on the pleural fluid. A pleural fluid haematocrit >50% of the patient 's peripheral blood haematocrit is diagnostic of a haemothorax.29 Differentiating between a pleural fluid exudate and transudate <Light 's criteria should be used to distinguish between a pleural fluid exudate and transudate (box 2). (B) <In order to apply Light 's criteria, the total protein and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be measured in both blood and pleural fluid. (B) Categorisation of pleural effusions into transudates and exudates is an important early step in narrowing the differential diagnosis and directing subsequent investigations and manage- ment (see boxes 3 and 4). Classically, pleural fluid protein >30 g/l has g/l This classi cation is not accurate when serum protein is abnormal or when the pleural fluid protein is close to 30 g/l and, as this is very common, the application of Light 's criteria is always recommended.30 A considerable number of other biochemical markers have been compared with Light 's criteria but the latter, with a diagnosticTable 1 Pleural fluid tests and sample collection guidance Test Notes Recommended tests for all sampled pleural effusions Biochemistry: LDH and protein 2 e5 ml in plain container or serum blood collection tube depending on local policy.

Box 3 Causes of pleural transudates Very common ventricular Putrid odour method.3132This discrim- inatory accuracy is unlikely to be surpassed as the 'gold standard ' forcomparisonin clinical diagnosis which itself carries an error rate. In congestive cardiac failure, diuretic therapy increases the concentration of protein, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lipids in pleural fluid and, in this context, Light 's criteria are recognised to misclassify a signi cant proportion of effusions as exudates.3334 Although the use of continuous likelihood ratios rather than a dichotomous division of transudates versus exudates has been proposed, particularly to overcome loss of accuracy of Light 's criteria when pleural protein and LDH levels are close to cut-off values, there is probably little value in this cumbersome statis- tical method beyond careful interpretation of test results in the light of clinical judgement.35 N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) of both systolic and diastolic cardiac failure. Levels in blood and pleural fluid correlate closely and measurement of both has been shown in several series to be effective in discriminating transudates associated with conges- tive heart failure from other transudative or exudative causes.36e39The cut-off value of these studies, however, varied widely from 600 to 4000 pg/ml (with 1500 pg/ml being most commonly used), and most studies excluded patients with more than one possible aetiology for their effusion. NT-proBNP has been shown to correctly diagnose congestive heart failure as a cause of most effusions that have been misclassi ed as exudates by Light 's criteria. Use of this test may therefore avoid repeated invasive investigations in patients where there is a strong clinical suspicion of cardiac failure.40e42As results with pleural fluid and blood are comparable, applying the test to blood alone is suf cient (see evidence table A available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk). Evidence for the use of measuring BNP (also known as C-terminal BNP, the active peptide from which NT-proBNP is cleaved) is relatively scarce to date. Pleural fluid differential cell counts <Pleural fluid cell proportions are helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis but none are disease- speci c. (C)<Any long-standing pleural effusion tends to become populated by lymphocytes. Pleural malignancy, cardiac failure and tuberculosis are common speci c causes of lymphocyte-predominant effusions. (C) If the pleural fluid differential cell count shows a predominant lymphocytosis ( >50% cells are lymphocytes), the most likely diagnoses worldwide are malignancy and tuberculosis (TB).43 Cardiac failure is also a common cause of a lymphocytic effu- sion. Very high lymphocyte proportions 5).44 Neutrophil-predominant pleural effusions acute processes. They occur in parapneumonic effusions, pulmonary embolism, acute TB of cells are are dened as eosinophilic.46The most common cause of pleural fluid eosinophilia is air or blood in the pleural space.47Pleural eosinophilia is a relatively non-speci is also a common cause; a malignant diagnosis was made in 37% of 60 eosinophilic effusions in one series.46 effusions, when pleural infection is suspected, pleural fluid pH should be measured providing that appropriate collection technique can be observed and a blood gas analyser is available. (B) <Inclusion of air or local anaesthetic in samples may signicantly alter the pH results and should be avoided. (B) <In a parapneumonic effusion, a pH of <7.2 indicates the need for tube drainage. (B) Pleural fluid acidosis (pH <7.30) occurs in malignant effusions, complicated (particularly rheumatoid arthritis), tuberculous pleural effusions and oesophageal rupture and, in isolation, it does not distinguish between these causes.50 Pleural fluid acidosis re flects an increase in lactic acid and carbon dioxide production due to locally increased metabolic activity as well as a fall in hydrogen ion flux across abnormal pleural membranes. Increased consumption of glucose without replacement in the same conditions means that pleural fluid often has both a low pH and low glucose concentration.51Box 4 Causes of pleural exudates Common infarction <Post-coronary artery syndrome (and other lymphatic disorders eg, lymphangioleiomyomatosis) <Drugs pH has been associated with shorter survival, more extensive disease and a lower chance of successful pleurodesis.52A meta-analysis including 417 patients with malignant pleural effusions found that a pleural pH<7.28 was associated with a median survival of 2.5 months and a 3-month survival of 38.9% (95% CI 31.1% to 46.8%) compared with a median survival of 4.3 months and 3-month survival of 61.6% (95% CI 55.7% to 67.4%) if the pH was >7.28.53 In clinical practice, the most important use for pleural fluid pH is aiding the decision to treat pleural infection with tube drainage. A meta-analysis of studies examining pleural pH and the need for chest tube drainage or surgery in patients with a parapneumonic effusion found that a pH <7.2 was the most speci c discriminator of complicated pleural infection.54This is covered in detail in the pleural infection guideline. In loculated parapneumonic effusions, fluid pH has been shown to vary signi cantly between locules so that a pH >7.2 in a patient with other clinical indicators of complicated pleural infection should be viewed with caution.55 The collection and analysis technique can have a clinically signicant impact on pleural fluid pH results. A prospective study found that exposure of fluid to air in the syringe increased the measured pleural fluid pH by $0.05 in 71% of samples and inclusion of 0.2 ml local anaesthetic produced a mean reduction in pH of 0.15 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.18).56Pleural fluid should therefore be collected and transported without exposure to atmospheric air and local anaesthetic avoided for diagnostic aspirations where the pH will be used to guide management. Pleural pH does not change signi cantly if processing is delayed for up to an hour at room temperature. An arterial blood gas analyser should be used.57In routine clinical practice it is often difcult to adhere to these collection requirements and, when they cannot be achieved, overall clinical assessment may be preferable to reliance on a suboptimal pleural fluid pH result. Glucose In the absence of pleural pathology, glucose diffuses freely across the pleural membrane and the pleural fluid glucose concentration is equivalent to blood.1 A low pleural fluid glucose level ( <3.4 and oesophageal rupture.1The most common causes of a very low pleural fluid glucose level ( <1.6 mmol/l) are rheumatoid arthritis and empyema.58 59 Although glucose is usually low in pleural infection and correlates with pleural fluid pH values, it is a signi cantly less accurate indicator for chest tube drainage than pH.54 When pleural fluid glucose is measured, the sample should be sent in a fluoride oxalate tube. Amylase <Routine measurements of pleural fluid amylase or its isoenzymes are not warranted. It can, however, be useful in suspected cases of oesophageal rupture or effusions associated with pancreatic diseases. (C) Pleural fluid amylase levels are elevated if they are higher than the upper limit of normal for serum or the pleural fluid/serum ratio is >1.0.60This suggests the malignancy effusions have raised pleural fluid levels,63although there is probably no role for pleural amylase estimation in the routine investigation of malignant effusions.64 Isoenzyme analysis can be useful but is not readily available in many laboratories. Elevation of salivary amylase suggests oeso- phageal rupture or contain pancreatic amylase.61 The incidence of pleural effusion with acute pancreatitis exceeds 50%. Patients with acute pancreatitis and a pleural effusion tend to have more severe disease and a higher likelihood of subse- quently developing a pseudocyst than those without effusions.65 If oesophageal rupture is entertained as a differential diagnosis, urgent more speci c investigation by contrast radiography or endoscopy is indicated. There are few data regarding the measurement of pleural fluid lipase, although case reports of pleural effusions secondary to pancreatitis have described its elevation alongside amylase.66 CYTOLOGY <Malignant effusions can be diagnosed by pleural fluid cytology in about 60% of cases. (B) <The yield from sending more than two specimens (taken on different occasions) is very low and should be avoided. (B) <Immunocytochemistry should be used to differentiate between malignant cell types and can be very important in guiding oncological therapy. (C) If malignancy is suspected, cytological examination of the pleural fluid is a quick and minimally invasive way to obtain a diagnosis. Series examining the diagnostic rate for malignancy of pleural cytology have reported a mean sensitivity of about 60% (range 40 e87%).67e70The yield from sending more than two specimens of pleural fluid taken on different occasions is low. One study found a yield of 65% from the rst specimen, a further 27% from the second specimen and only 5% from the third.70The diagnostic yield for malignancy depends on sample preparation, the experience of the cytologist and on tumour type. The diagnostic rate is higher for adenocarcinoma than for mesothelioma, squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma and sarcoma. Swiderek et al found that submission of a 60 ml pleural fluid sample produced a signi cantly better sensitivity for the diag- nosis of malignancy than 10 ml, but previous studies have shown that sending volumes >50 ml did not improve the diagnostic yield.2324The evidence for sending large volumes of pleural fluid is not strong enough to justify the increased risk of complications associated with the use of a ven flon and three- way tap for initial diagnostic aspiration. As much fluid as possible should be sent for cytology from the available diag- nostic sample (likely to be 20 e40 ml) and, when the initial result is negative but malignancy is suspected, the sending of a higher volume sample following a second aspiration should be considered. If the initial aspiration is both therapeutic and diagnostic, $60 ml should be sent for cytological examination. Pleural fluid should be sent in a plain container which allows the cellular portion to separate, forming a brinous 'clot 'which may enmesh malignant cells. These can then undergo histological examination and are reported with the fluid cytology. Some departments, however, prefer the use of bottles containing sodium citrate to keep the cells in free suspension. No other anticoagu- lants or preservatives should be used as they may interfere with cellular adherence to slides malignancy increases if both cell blocks (which are formed by centrifuging the sample and extracting the solid cellular portion) and smears are prepared from pleural fluid samples.71 T able 3 provides an interpretation of common pleural fluid cytology reports seen in clinical practice. Once malignancy has been con rmed morphologically, immunocytochemistry should be used to differentiate between different malignant cell types. This can be performed on a cytology sample, cell block or a clot.72There is particularly extensive morphological overlap between malignant mesothe- lioma and metastatic adenocarcinoma cells and immunocyto- chemistry can assist in their differentiation. However, whenever possible, pleural tissue should be obtained to con rm a diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. If lymphoma is suspected on morphological examination, ideally a sample should be submitted for flow cytometry for further typing, but immunocytochemistry can be used if this is unavailable (table 3).73 TUMOUR MARKERS <Pleural fluid and serum tumour markers do not currently have a role in the routine investigation of pleural effusions. (C) At a cut-off level that achieves 100% speci city for the diagnosis of malignancy, a panel of pleural fluid tumour markers including CEA, CA-125, CA 15-3 and CYFRA has been shown to reach a combined sensitivity of only 54%, such that a negative result cannot be used to support a conservative approach to monitoring and investigation.74 Mesothelin, however, has been shown to have more promising diagnostic characteristics (see evidence table B available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk). Mesothelin Mesothelin is a glycoprotein tumour marker that is present at higher mean concentrations in the blood and pleural fluid of patients with malignant mesothelioma than in patients with other causes of pleural effusion.7576Studies examining meso- thelin levels in serum and/or pleural fluid have demonstrated a sensitivity of 48 e84% and speci city of 70 e100% for the diagnosis of mesothelioma.75e80The negative predictive value of the test is limited by false negatives in sarcomatoid mesothe- lioma.79Positive results pancreatic A positive serum or pleural fluid mesothelin level is highly suggestive of pleural malignancy and might be used to expedite a tissue diagnosis, but a negative result cannot be consideredreassuring. Pleural fluid mesothelin has been shown to have additional value beyond pleural fluid cytology in the diagnosis of mesothelioma and might be used for its positive predictive value to clarify indeterminate cytology results.80Although mesothelin has a greater diagnostic accuracy than other tumour markers, its real clinical utility in the investigation of an undiagnosed pleural effusion, particularly in combination with routine clinical and radiological assessment, warrants further study before its use can be routinely recommended. FURTHER DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING Computed tomography (CT) <CT scans for pleural effusion should be performed with contrast enhancement of the pleura and before complete drainage of pleural fluid. (C) <CT scans should be performed in the investigation of all undiagnosed exudative pleura l effusions and can be useful in distinguishing malignant from benign pleural thickening. (C) <A CT scan should be requested for complicated pleural infection when initial tube drainage has been unsuc- cessful and surgery is to be considered. (C) When investigating a pleural effusion, a contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scan should be performed before full drainage of the fluid as pleural abnormalities will be better visualised.82Free- flowing pleural fluid is seen as a sickle-shaped opacity in the most dependent part of the thorax. Suspended air bubbles within the fluid imply septations ( gure 4), but CT does not distinguish the internal characteristics of pleural fluid with the same sensitivity as ultrasound.17 CT is particularly helpful in the diagnosis of empyema when the pleura enhances intensely around the fluid which usually forms a lenticular opacity ( gure 4).8384CT also distinguishes empyemas There are features of contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scanning which can help differentiate between benign and malignant disease ( gure 5). In a study of 74 patients, 39 of whom had malignant disease, Leung et al showed that malignant disease is favoured by nodular pleural thickening, cities of and of 51%, 36%, 56% and 41%.85The accuracy of the criteria of Leung et alfor the detection of pleural malignancy has been con rmed in several prospective studies.82 86Differentiation of pleural mesotheliomaTable 3 Reporting of pleural fluid cytology results Report Interpretation Inadequate No mesothelial cells or only degenerate cells present No malignant cells seen Adequate sample without evidence of malignancy (does not exclude malignancy) Atypical cells May be of inflammatory or malignant origin. Sending a further sample may be helpful Suspicious for malignancy Occasional cells with malignant features but not denitively malignant Malignant Unequivocal malignant cells present which require typing by immunocytochemistry Figure 4 CT scan of left empyema with pleural enhancement (a) and cult as the conditions share many CT features. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) MRI distinguishes accurately between benign and malignant pleural effusions via differences in signal intensity on T2-weighted images.87Distinction of morphological features of pleural malignancy by MRI has been shown in some studies to equal CT and assessment of diaphragmatic and chest wall involvement is superior.88Access to MRI is limited and it does not have a place in the routine investigation of pleural effusions at this time, but may be used to accurately assess pleural disease in patients for whom contrast is contraindicated. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI has shown promise in the monitoring of response of pleural mesothelioma to chemotherapy.89 PET-CT imaging While the uptake of 18- fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) has been shown to be greater in malignant pleural effusions, the value of PET-CT imaging in distinguishing benign and malignant disease is limited by false positives in patients with pleural in flammation including pleural infection and following talc pleurodesis.90e92PET-CT imaging does not currently have a role in the routine investigation of pleural effusions but, in common with dynamic contrast- enhanced MRI, there is emerging evidence suggesting a potential role in monitoring the response to treatment of pleural mesothelioma.93e95 INVASIVE INVESTIGATIONS Percutaneous pleural biopsy <When investigating an where malignancy is suspected and areas of pleural nodularity are shown on contrast-enhanced CT needle is the percutaneous pleural biopsy method of choice. (A) <Abrams needle biopsies are only diagnostically useful in areas with a high incidence of TB, although thoraco- scopic and image-guided cutting needles have been shown to have a higher diagnostic yield. (C) A review of Abrams pleural biopsy yield from 2893 examinations showed a diagnostic rate of only 57% for malignancy.96The yield over pleural fluid cytology alone is increased by only 7e27% for malignancy.68 69Complications of Abrams pleuralbiopsy include site secondary to haemorrhage. The contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scan of a patient with a pleural effusion will often show a focal area of abnormal pleura. An image-guided cutting needle biopsy allows that focal area of abnormality to be biopsied. It has a higher yield than that of blind pleural biopsy in the diagnosis of malignancy. This technique is particularly useful in patients who are unsuitable for thoracoscopy. Pleural malignant deposits tend to predominate close to the midline and diaphragm, which are areas best avoided when performing an Abrams biopsy. However, these anatomical regions are possible to biopsy safely under radiological imaging. In a recent prospective study, 33 patients with a pleural effusion and pleural pleural biopsy. Correct histological in 21 of 24 (sensitivity 88%, speci city 100%) including 13 of 14 patients with mesothelioma (sensitivity 93%).97In a larger retrospective review of image- guided pleural biopsy in one department by a single radiologist, 18 of the 21 mesothelioma cases were correctly identi ed (sensitivity 86%, speci city 100%).98 Image-guided cutting needle biopsies have been shown to be superior to Abrams needle biopsies in the diagnostic yield for malignant disease. In a randomised controlled trial of 50 consecutive patients with cytology-negative suspected malig- nant pleural effusions, 47%, speci city 100%, negative predictive value 44%, positive predictive value 100%) and CT- guided biopsy correctly malignancy in 13/15 tivity 87%, speci 100%, negative predictive value 80%, positive predictive value 100%).99 In a prospective trial comparing local anaesthetic thoraco- scopy with Abrams biopsy in an area with a high prevalence of TB,100thoracoscopy was found to have a combined culture/ histology sensitivity of 100% compared with 79% for Abrams pleural biopsy. The technique with the highest diagnostic rate for tuberculous pleuritis on the basis of published evidence is therefore local anaesthetic thoracoscopy. However, since blind pleural biopsy has reasonably high sensitivity and is likely to be more cost effective as an initial diagnostic procedure, it will often be the procedure of rst choice in resource-poor areas with a high incidence of TB. Blind pleural biopsy cannot be justi ed for the diagnosis of TB where the incidence is not high enough to maintain operator experience (see evidence table C available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk). Thoracoscopy <Thoracoscopy is the investigation of choice in exudative pleural effusions where a diagnostic pleural aspiration is inconclusive and malignancy is suspected. (C) In patients with a symptomatic exudative pleural effusion where a diagnostic pleural aspiration is negative or inconclusive, thoracoscopy is suggested as the next choice investigation since the procedure will be relatively uncomplicated and pleurodesis is likely to be indicated. Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy can be performed by physicians or surgeons and is a safe and well tolerated procedure. Major complications (eg, empyema, haemorrhage and pneumonia) occur in only 2.3% (95% CI 1.9% to 2.8%) and death is rare at Figure 5 Right malignant pleural effusion with enhancing nodular pleural thickening diagnostic sensitivity for malignant pleural disease of 92.6% (95% CI 91.0% to 93.9%).101e121It also has a higher diagnostic yield than blind pleural biopsy for tuberculous pleuritis. T alc poudrage can be administered at the end of the procedure which achieves a successful pleurodesis in 80 e90% (see BTS guideline on thoracoscopy for further detail. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) This is performed by thoracic surgeons and requires a general anaesthetic. It is therefore not a suitable option for frail indi- viduals and those with other severe comorbidities. This proce- dure reports similarly high diagnostic sensitivity rates of approximately 95% for malignancy and is also relatively safe with a low complication rate. In one series of 566 examinations, the most common side effect was subcutaneous emphysema with cardiac dysrhythmia and air embolism occurring in <1% and no deaths.122 One advantage of VATS over local anaesthetic thoracoscopy is that the surgical operator is able to proceed to other thoracic surgical options, if appropriate, at the time of the procedure. In particular, a judgement can be made as to whether the lung is trapped or free to expand. In trapped lung syndrome, pleurodesis is likely to be less effective so an indwelling pleural catheter can be placed at the time of VATS (see BTS guideline on thoraco- scopy. Bronchoscopy <Routine undiagnosed pleural effusion. (C) <Bronchoscopy should be considered if there is haemo- ptysis or clinical or radiographic features suggestive of bronchial obstruction. (C) Bronchoscopy has a limited role in the investigation of patients with an undiagnosed pleural effusion as its diagnostic yield is very low.123e126It should be reserved for patients whose radi- ology suggests the presence of a mass or loss of volume or when there is a history of haemoptysis, possible aspiration of a foreign body or a trapped lung with a suspicion of a proximal lung mass. If bronchoscopy is deemed necessary, it should be performed after pleural drainage in order to perform adequate examination without extrinsic airway compression by pleural fluid. SPECIFIC CONDITIONS AND TESTS Tuberculous pleurisy <When pleural biopsies are taken, they should be sent for both histological examination and culture to improve the diagnostic sensitivity for TB. (B) <Thoracoscopic pleural biopsies are the test most likely to yield positive mycobacterial culture (and therefore drug sensitivity) results. (B) <Surrogate markers of pleural TB are useful 'rule out ' tests in low incidence countries. Adenosine deaminase is the most thoroughly validated to date. (B) T uberculous pleuritis is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction to mycobacterial protein and the mycobacterial load in the pleural fluid is usually low. Pleural fluid microscopy for acid-fast bacilli therefore has a sensitivity <5% and pleural fluid culture of 10e20%.127Thoracoscopic pleural biopsy has been shown to have a sensitivity of >70% for culture of pleural tissue and overall diagnostic sensitivity approaches 100% when evidence of caseating granulomas on pleural cause of a lymphocytic pleural effusion. It is desirable to exclude the diagnosis in patients with lymphocytic effusions, avoiding inappropriate and side effect-prone empirical antituberculous therapy. In patients who are un t for invasive investigations, pleural fluid or blood biomarkers of infection can be useful. Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is an enzyme present in lymphocytes, and its level in pleural fluid is signi cantly raised in most tuberculous pleural effusions. A meta-analysis of 63 studies on the diagnostic use of ADA con rmed a sensitivity of 92%, speci city 90% and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 9.0 and 0.10, respectively.128 Raised ADA levels can also be seen in empyema, rheumatoid pleurisy and, occasionally, in malignancy. Restricting the use of ADA to lymphocytic effusions or measurement of isoenzyme ADA-2 can reduce the false positives signi cantly.129ADA is very cheap and quick to perform and remains stable when stored at 4 8C for up to 28 days.130It is useful in patients with HIV or those immunosuppressed (eg, renal transplant). In countries with a low prevalence of TB, ADA is a useful 'rule out ' test. Unstimulated interferon glevels in pleural fluid have also been shown to have similar diagnostic accuracy as ADA in a meta- analysis.131The former, however, is more expensive. Interferon g release assays (IGRAs) have been studied. Applied to blood in areas with a low incidence of TB, sensitivities as high as 90% have been reported but speci city is limited by an inability of the tests to distinguish latent from active TB.132Small studies have applied IGRAs to pleural fluid with demonstration of superior sensitivities (96.4%), although the commercial tests are not yet validated for fluids other than blood.133While further studies are awaited, overall diagnostic performance, ease of use and cost are unlikely to rival that of ADA.134 In well-resourced healthcare settings, the greatest chance of obtaining mycobacterial culture and sensitivities should be pursued via thoracoscopic pleural biopsies. However, a large review of 7549 cases of tuberculous pleuritis by the Center for Disease Control showed that drug resistance patterns of pleural TB in the USA broadly re flected those of pulmonary TB in the same region.135If mycobacterial culture and sensitivities are not achieved, the treatment regime should re flect that of the local resistance patterns. Connective tissue diseases Rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are the most common connective tissue diseases to involve the pleura. Pleural effusions occur in connective tissue disease due to primary autoimmune pleuritis or secondary to renal, cardiac, thromboembolic disease or Rheumatoid pleural effusions secondary to have a very low glucose level of <1.6 mmol/l (29 mg/dl). (D) Pleural involvement with rheumatoid arthritis.136Rheumatoid arthritis-associated pleural effusions occur more frequently in men, although the disease itself is more common in women.137Chronic rheumatoid effusions are the most common cause of pseudochylous (cholesterol) effusions in countries with a low incidence of TB, but they can also be serous or haemorrhagic in appearance.138 139The measurement of triglycerides and cholesterol in milky effusions will con rm the diagnosis of a pseudochylous picture and, in the 2):ii4 eii17. causes for the effusion unlikely. Rheumatoid arthritis is unlikely to be the cause of a chronic effusion if the glucose level in the fluid is>1.6 mmol/l, serving as a useful screening test.5880% of rheumatoid pleural effusions have a pleural fluid glucose to serum ratio of <0.5 and ap H <7.30.140However, in acute rheumatoid pleurisy, the glucose and pH may be normal.141Measurement of C4 complement in pleural fluid may be of additional help, with levels<0.04 g/l in all cases of rheumatoid pleural disease and in only 2 of 118 controls reported in one study.141Rheumatoid factor can be measured on the pleural fluid and often has a titre of>1:320.142However, it can be present in effusions of other aetiology and often mirrors the serum value, adding little diag- nostically.141 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) <Pleural fluid antinuclear antibodies should not be measured routinely as it re flects the serum level and is therefore usually unhelpful. (C) Pleuritis is the rst manifestation of SLE in 5 e10% of patients but is an early feature in 25 e30% and is usually accompanied by multisystem involvement. Pleural effusions are frequently small and are bilateral in 50% of patients.143 No test de nitively positively distinguishes SLE pleuritis from other causes of exudative effusions. Biochemical features are not distinctive or consistent.144145Elevated pleural fluid antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and an increased pleural fluid to serum ANA ratio is suggestive of SLE pleuritis, but elevation is also some- times seen in malignant effusions.146Porcel et al measured pleural fluid ANA titres in 266 patients with pleural effusions of established cause including 15 with SLE pleuritis. They demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 97% to 100%) and (95% CI 91% to 97%) for the pleural fluid test but, consistent with previous reports, the results were identical when testing serum.147There is no additional value in measuring pleural fluid ANA above the serum test. Pleural effusions due to pulmonary embolism Pleural effusions detectable on chest x-ray occur in 23 e48% of patients with pulmonary emboli.148Effusions are small (less than one-third of the hemithorax) in up to 90% of cases, although moderate and massive effusions are also recognised.3 They may be ipsilateral, contralateral or bilateral relative to the radiologically-detected embolus.23 Recent series applying Light 's criteria have found that pleural effusions associated with pulmonary embolism are always exudates.3149Fluid characteristics, however, are non-speci c and unhelpful in making the diagnosis which should be pursued radiologically, given a high index of clinical suspicion or in the context of an effusion that remains undiagnosed after standard baseline investigations. Chylothorax and pseudochylothorax <If a chylothorax or pseudochylothorax is suspected, pleural fluid should be tested for cholesterol crystals and chylomicrons and the pleural fluid triglyceride and cholesterol levels measured. (C) If the pleural fluid appears milky, chylothorax and pseudo- chylothorax must be considered. Occasionally an empyema can be suf ciently turbid to be confused with chyle. They can be distinguished by bench centrifugation which leaves a clear supernatant in empyema while chylous effusion remains milky. It should be noted that, in starved patients, chyle may not appear milky.True chylous effusions (chylothorax) result from disruption of the thoracic duct or its tributaries such that chyle is present in the pleural space. Trauma, particularly following thoracic surgery, probably causes about 50% with medical causes including malignancy (particularly lymphoma), TB and lymphatic malformations accounting for most of the remaining half (box 6).150 Unlike other exudative effusions, the diagnosis of chylothorax or its underlying cause cannot usually be established from thoracoscopy or pleural biopsies. In non-surgical cases, a CTscan of the thorax to exclude mediastinal pathology (especially lymphoma) is mandatory. The site of leak may be demonstrated by lymphangiography. Chylothorax must be distinguished from pseudochylothorax or 'cholesterol pleurisy 'which results from the accumulation of cholesterol crystals. Rheumatoid pleurisy and tuberculous pleuritis are the most commonly reported causes of a pseudo- chylous effusion.138 151Pseudochylothorax usually arises from chronic (often years) pleural effusion and the pleura is usually markedly thickened.152Exceptions do exist and clinicians are encouraged not to discard the diagnosis in the absence of chro- nicity and thickened pleura.153 Chylothorax and pseudochylothorax can be discriminated by lipid analysis of the fluid. Demonstration of chylomicrons conrms a chylothorax, whereas the presence of cholesterol crystals diagnoses pseudochylothorax. A true chylothorax will usually have a high triglyceride level, usually >1.24 mmol/l (110 mg/dl) and can usually be excluded if the triglyceride level is<0.56 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) or the presence of choles- terol crystals is diagnostic irrespective of triglyceride levels (see table 4).152e154 Chylothorax can be a result of transdiaphragmatic migration of chylous ascites, which can be secondary to hepatic cirrhosis. In these cases, the pleural effusion is often a transudate.Box 6 and pseudochylo- Pseudochylothorax <Tuberculosis <Rheumatoid arthritis cylothorax mmol/l mg/dl) Usually low Cholesterol crystals Often present are commonly diagnosed in therst two decades after asbestos exposure. The prevalence is dose-related with a shorter latency period than other asbestos-related disorders.155The effusion is usually small and asymptomatic, often with pleural fluid which is haemor- rhagic.156 157There is a propensity for the effusion to resolve within 6 months, leaving behind residual diffuse pleural thick- ening.156 157As there are no de nitive tests, the diagnosis can only be made with certainty after a prolonged period of follow-up and consideration should be given to early thoraco- scopy with pleural biopsy in any patient with a pleural effusion and a history of asbestos exposure, particularly in the presence of chest pain.

MANAGEMENT OF PERSISTENT UNDIAGNOSED EFFUSIONS Even after a complete investigation including thoracoscopic biopsies, a signi cant number of patients with pleural are pleuritis 'and no speci c diag- nosis can be made. A retrospective study of 75 such patients found that only 8.3% of these turned out to be malignant over a 2-year follow-up period. The majority of patients with non-speci c pleuritis (91.7%) followed a benign course, with spontaneous resolution of the effusion in 81.8% of cases.163 In patients not t enough for thoracoscopy, it is sensible to reconsider diagnoses with a speci c treatment (eg, TB, pulmo- nary embolism, lymphoma considerable number of undiagnosed pleural effusions in this category are due to a malignant process. Watchful waiting may be the appropriate management in this setting. Competing interests No member of the Guideline Group is aware of any competing interests.

Hum Reprod guideline 2010 Andrew MacDuff,1Anthony Arnold,2John Harvey,3on behalf of the BTS Pleural Disease Guideline Group INTRODUCTION The term 'pneumothorax 'wasrst coined by Itard and then Laennec in 1803 and 1819 respectively,1 and refers to air in the pleural cavity (ie, inter- spersed between the lung and the chest wall). At that time, most cases of pneumothorax were secondary to tuberculosis, although some were recognised as occurring in otherwise healthy patients ( 'pneumothorax simple '). This classi ca- tion has endured subsequently, with the rst modern description of pneumothorax occurring in healthy people (primary spontaneous pneumo- thorax, PSP) being that of Kj\u00e6rgaard2in 1932. It is a signi cant global health problem, with a reported incidence of 18 e28/100 000 cases per annum for men and 1.2 e6/100 000 for women.3 Secondary pneumothorax (SSP) is associated with underlying lung disease, in distinction to PSP, although tuberculosis is no longer the commonest underlying lung disease in the developed world. The consequences of a pneumothorax in patients with pre-existing lung disease are signi cantly greater, and the management is potentially more dif cult. Combined hospital admission rates for PSP and SSP in the UK have been reported as 16.7/100 000 for men and 5.8/100 000 for women, with corre- sponding mortality rates of 1.26/million and 0.62/ million per annum between 1991 and 1995.4 With regard to the aetiology of pneumothorax, anatomical abnormalities have been demonstrated, even in the absence of overt underlying lung disease. Subpleural blebs and bullae are found at the lung apices at thoracoscopy and on CT scanning in up to 90% of cases of PSP,56and are thought to play a role. More recent auto fluorescence studies7 have revealed pleural porosities in adjacent areas that were invisible with white light. Small airways obstruction, mediated by an in flux of in flammatory cells, often characterises pneumothorax and may become manifest in the smaller airways at an earlier stage with 'emphysema-like changes '(ELCs).8 Smoking has been implicated in this aetiological pathway, the smoking habit being associated with a 12% risk of developing pneumothorax in healthy smoking men compared with 0.1% in non- smokers.9Patients with PSP tend to be taller than control patients.10 11The gradient of negative pleural pressure increases from the lung base to the apex, so that alveoli at the lung apex in tall indi- viduals are subject to signi cantly greater distending pressure than those at the base of the lung, and the vectors in theory predispose to the development of apical subpleural blebs.12 Although it is to some extent counterintuitive, there is no evidence that a relationship existsbetween the onset of pneumothorax and physical activity, the onset being as likely to occur during sedentary activity.13 Despite the apparent relationship between smoking and pneumothorax, 80 e86% of young patients continue to smoke after their rst episode of PSP.14The risk of recurrence of PSP is as high as 54% within the rst 4 years, with isolated risk factors including smoking, height and age >60 years.12 15 Risk factors for recurrence of SSP include age, pulmonary brosis and emphysema.15 16Thus, efforts should be directed at smoking cessation after the development of a pneumothorax. The initial British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines for the treatment of pneumothoraces were published in 1993.17Later studies suggested that compliance with these guidelines was improving but remained suboptimal at only 20e40% among non-respiratory and A&E staff. Clinical guidelines have been shown to improve clinical practice,18 19compliance being related to the complexity of practical procedures20and strengthened by the presence of an evidence base.21The second version of the BTS guidelines was published in 200322a n dr e i n f o r c e dt h et r e n d towards safer and less invasive management strategies, together with detailed advice on a range of associated issues and conditions. It included algorithms for the management of PSP and SSP but excluded the management of trauma. This guideline seeks to consolidate and update the pneumothorax guidelines in the light of subse- quent research and using the SIGN methodology. Traumatic pneumothorax is not covered by this guideline. <SSP is associated with a higher morbidity and mortality than PSP. (D) <Strong emphasis should be placed on smoking cessation to minimise the risk of recurrence. (D) <Pneumothorax is not usually associated with physical exertion. (D) CLINICAL EVALUATION <Symptoms in PSP may be minimal or absent. In contrast, symptoms are greater in SSP, even if the pneumothorax is rela- tively small in size. (D) <The presence of breathlessness in fluences the management strategy. (D) <Severe symptoms and signs of respiratory distress suggest the presence of tension pneumothorax. (D) The typical symptoms of chest pain and dyspnoea may be relatively minor or even absent,23so that1Respiratory Medicine, Royal Inrmary of Edinburgh, UK 2Department of Respiratory Medicine, Castle Hill Hospital, Cottingham, East Yorkshire, UK 3North Bristol Lung Centre, Southmead Hospital, Bristol, UK Correspondence to Dr John Harvey, North Bristol Lung Centre, Southmead Hospital, Bristol BS10 5NB, UK; john.harvey@nbt.nhs.uk Received 12 2010; 65(Suppl 2):ii18 eii31. doi:10.1136/thx.2010.136986BTS guidelinesa high index of initial diagnostic suspicion is required. Many patients (especially those with PSP) therefore present several days after the onset of symptoms.24The longer this period of time, the greater is the risk of re-expansion pulmonary oedema (RPO).25 26In general, the clinical symptoms associated with SSP are more severe than those associated with PSP, and most patients with SSP experience breathlessness that is out of proportion to the size of the pneumothorax.27 28These clinical manifestations are therefore unreliable indicators of the size of the pneumothorax.29 30When severe symptoms are accompa- nied by signs of cardiorespiratory distress, tension pneumo- thorax must be considered. The physical signs of a pneumothorax can be subtle but, char- acteristically, include reduced lung expansion, hyper-resonance and diminished breath sounds on the side of the pneumothorax. Added sounds such as 'clicking 'can occasionally be audible at the cardiac apex.23The presence of observable breathlessness has influenced subsequent management in previous guidelines.17 23 In association with these signs, cyanosis, sweating, severe tachypnoea, tachycardia and hypotension may indicate the presence of tension pneumothorax (see later section). Arterial blood gas measurements are frequently abnormal in patients with pneumothorax, with the arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) being <10.9 kPa in 75% of patients,31but are not required if the oxygen saturations are adequate ( >92%) on breathing room air. The hypoxaemia is greater in cases of SSP,31the Pa O2 being<7.5 kPa, together with a degree of carbon dioxide reten- tion in 16% of cases in a large series.32Pulmonary function tests are poor predictors of the presence or size of a pneumothorax7 and, in any case, tests of forced expiration are generally best avoided in this situation. The diagnosis of pneumothorax is usually con rmed by imaging techniques (see below) which may also yield informa- tion about the size of the pneumothorax, but clinical evaluation should probably be the main determinant of the management strategy as well as assisting the initial diagnosis. IMAGING Initial diagnosis <Standard erect chest x-rays in inspiration are recom- mended for the initial diagnosis of pneumothorax, rather than expiratory lms. (A) <The widespread adoption of digital imaging (PACS) requires diagnostic caution and further studies since the presence of a small pneumothorax may not be imme- diately apparent. (D) <CT scanning is recommended for uncertain or complex cases. (D) The following numerous imaging modalities have been employed for the diagnosis and management of pneumothorax: 1. Standard erect PA chest x-ray. 2. Lateral x-rays. 3. Expiratory lms. 4. Supine and lateral decubitus x-rays. 5. Ultrasound scanning. 6. Digital imaging. 7. CT scanning. Standard erect PA chest x-ray This has been the mainstay of clinical management of primary and secondary pneumothorax for many years, although it is acknowledged to have limitations such as the dif culty in accurately quantifying pneumothorax size. Major technological advances in the last decade have resulted in the advent of digitalchest imaging, so that conventional chest lms are no longer easily available in clinical practice in the UK or in many other modern healthcare systems. The diagnostic characteristic is displacement of the pleural line. In up to 50% of cases an air- fluid level is visible in the costophrenic angle, and this is occa- sionally the only apparent abnormality.33The presence of bullous lung disease can lead to the erroneous diagnosis of pneumothorax, with unfortunate consequences for the patient. If uncertainty exists, then CT scanning is highly desirable (see below). Lateral x-rays These may provide additional information when a suspected pneumothorax is not con rmed by a PA chest lm33but, again, are no longer routinely used in everyday clinical practice. Expiratory lms These are not thought to confer additional bene t in the routine assessment of pneumothorax.34e36 Supine and lateral decubitus x-rays These imaging techniques have mostly been employed for trauma patients who cannot be safely moved. They are generally less sensitive than erect PA x-rays for the diagnosis of pneu- mothorax3738and have been superseded by ultrasound or CT imaging for patients who cannot assume the erect posture. Ultrasound scanning Speci c features on ultrasound scanning are diagnostic of pneumothorax39but, to date, the main value of this technique has been in the management of supine trauma patients.40 Digital imaging Digital radiography (Picture-Archiving Communication Systems, PACS) has replaced conventional lm-based chest radiography across most UK hospitals within the last 5 years, conferring considerable advantages such as magni cation, measurement and contrast manipulation, ease of transmission, storage and repro- duction. Relatively few studies have addressed the speci c issue of pneumothorax and its diagnosis, and these have tended to focus on expert diagnosis (by consultant radiologists) and the more discriminating departmental (rather than ward-based) workstations. Even so, some dif culties were found in the diag- nosis of pneumothorax in early studies.4142Since then there have been technological advances, such that digital imaging may now be as reliable as more conventional chest x-rays in pneumothorax diagnosis, but there have been no more recent studies to con rm this. Differences exist between the characteristics (screen size, pixel count, contrast and luminescence) and therefore the sensi- tivity of the more expensive departmental devices and the desktop and mobile consoles available in the ward environment. It is currently recommended that, where primary diagnostic decisions are made based on the chest x-ray, a diagnostic PACS workstation is available for image review. In addition, digital images do not directly lend themselves to measurement and size calculations; an auxiliary function and use of a cursor is required, but this is almost certainly more accurate than using a ruler and is easy to learn to do. Non- specialist clinicians and trainees may not always be familiar with these functions. CT scanning This can be regarded as the 'gold standard 'in the detection of small pneumothoraces and in size estimation.43It lung disease44and for identifying aberrant chest drain placement45or additional lung pathology. However, practical constraints preclude its general use as the initial diagnostic modality. Size of pneumothorax <In de ning a management strategy, the size of a pneu- mothorax is less important than the degree of clinical compromise. (D) <The differentiation of a 'large 'from a 'small 'pneumo- thorax continues to be the presence of a visible rim of >2 cm between the lung margin and the chest wall (at the level of the hilum) and is easily measured with the PACS system. (D) <Accurate pneumothorax size calculations are best achieved by CT scanning. (C) The size of pneumothoraces does not correlate well with the clinical manifestations.2930The clinical symptoms associated with secondary pneumothoraces are more severe in general than those associated with primary pneumothoraces, and may seem out of proportion to the size of the pneumothorax.27 28The clinical evaluation is therefore probably more important than the size of the pneumothorax in determining the management strategy. Commonly, the plain PA chest x-ray has been used to quantify the size of the pneumothorax. However, it tends to underestimate the size because it is a two-dimensional image while the pleural cavity is a three-dimensional structure. The 2003 BTS guidelines22advocated a more accurate means of size calculation than its predecessor in 1993,15using the cube function of two simple measurements, and the fact that a 2 cm radiographic pneumothorax approximates to a 50% pneumo- thorax by volume. There are dif culties with this approach, including the fact that some pneumothoraces are localised (rather than uniform), so that measurement ratios cannot be applied. The shape of the lung cannot be assumed to remain constant during collapse.46T h em e a s u r e m e n to ft h er a t i oo f the lung to the hemithorax diameter is accurate and relatively easy with the new PACS systems by means of a cursor, once familiar with the PACS auxiliary functions. The choice of a 2 cm depth is a compromise between the theoretical risk of needle trauma with a more shallow pneu- mothorax and the signi cant volume and length of time to spontaneous resolution of a greater depth of pneumothorax.4748 Assuming a symmetrical pattern of lung collapse, then this measure is normally taken from the chest wall to the outer edge of the lung at the level of the hilum ( gure 1). Guidelines from the USA49estimated the volume of a pneumothorax by measuring the distance from the lung apex to the cupola, but this method would tend to overestimate the volume in a local- ised apical pneumothorax. Belgian guidelines have used yet another technique for measuring pneumothorax size, and comparisons between the different techniques have shown poor agreement.50 CT scanning is regarded as the best means of establishing the size of a pneumothorax51and has been calibrated in a lung model experiment.52 TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR PNEUMOTHORAX <Patients with pre-existing lung disease tolerate a pneu- mothorax less well, and the distinction between PSP and SSP should be made at the time of diagnosis to guide appropriate management. (D)<Breathlessness indicates the need for active intervention as well as supportive treatment (including oxygen). (D) <The size of the pneumothorax determines the rate of resolution and is a relative indication for active intervention. (D) Primary pneumothorax occurs in patients with no evidence of other underlying lung disease. Although histological abnormali- ties are usually present, associated in particular with cigarette smoking, they have not been manifested by symptoms or loss of function. In contrast, secondary pneumothorax usually occurs in patients with overt underlying lung disease, most commonly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is important to make this fundamental distinction as pneumothorax in COPD is much less well tolerated by the patient and tends to respond less favourably to management interventions and because the underlying lung disease requires appropriate treatment in addi- tion. Several series have shown a reduced success rate for aspi- ration in patients aged >50 years as well as for chronic lung disease. It seems likely that these older patients had unrecognised underlying lung disease. This age criterion was included in the flowchart for SSP in the 2003 guidelines and is incorporated into the new flowchart ( gure 2), serving as a prompt to consider the likelihood of SSP. Further criteria that are important in the deci- sion-making process are the presence of signi cant breathlessness and the size of the pneumothorax. The rate of resolution/reab- sorption of spontaneous pneumothoraces has been gauged as being between 1.25% and 2.2% of the volume of the hemithorax every 24 h,4748 52the higher and more recent estimate52being derived from CT volumetry. Thus, a complete pneumothorax might be expected to take up to 6 weeks to resolve spontaneously and, conceivably, in the presence of a persistent air leak, even longer. Management of PSP <Patients with PSP or SSP and signi cant breathlessness associated with any size of pneumothorax should undergo active intervention. (A) <Chest drains are usually required for patients with tension or bilateral pneumothorax who should be admitted to hospital. (D) Figure 1 PSP without signi cant breathlessness. (B) <Selected asymptomatic patients with a large PSP may be managed by observation alone. (A) <Patients with a small PSP without breathlessness should be considered for discharge with early outpatient review. These patients should also receive clear written advice to return in the event of worsening breathlessness. (D) Both tension pneumothorax and bilateral pneumothorax are potentially life-threatening events that require chest drain insertion. Because such patients are generally excluded from trials of spontaneous pneumothorax, there is no evidence upon which to base recommendations, advice being based on the grounds of safe practice. Similarly, patients with associated large pleural effusions (hydropneumothorax) have also been excluded from trials, but are likely to require chest drain insertion and further investigation (see separate guideline). A summary of the management recommendations is shown in the flowchart (gure 2) with explanatory detail in the text below. Minimal symptoms Conservative management of small pneumothoraces has been shown to be safe,4753 54and patients who are not breathless can be managed as outpatients providing they can easily seek medical attention if any deterioration in their symptoms occurs.Up to 80% of pneumothoraces estimated as smaller than 15% have no persistent air leak, and recurrence in those managed with observation alone is less than in those treated by chest drains.55Early review is advisable to ensure satisfactory resolu- tion and to reinforce the advice on lifestyle. There is no evidence that active intervention improves the associated pain, which simply warrants appropriate analgesia. Symptomatic pneumothorax Observation alone is inappropriate for breathless patients who require active intervention (needle aspiration or chest drain insertion). Marked breathlessness in a patient with a small PSP may herald tension pneumothorax.55If a patient is hospitalised for observation, supplemental high flow oxygen should be given where feasible. As well as correcting any arterial hypoxaemia,56 it has been shown to result in a fourfold increase in the rate of pneumothorax resolution.57In the presence of a continued air leak, the mechanism may be a reduction in the partial pressure of nitrogen in the pleural space relative to oxygen, which is more readily absorbed. Also, a similar effect in the pleural capillaries creates a more favourable resorption gradient.58 Needle aspiration or chest drain? <Needle (14 e16 G) aspiration (NA) is as effective as large-bore ( >20 F) chest drains and may be associated with reduced hospitalisation and length of stay. (A) tnacifingis # the interpleural distance at the level of the hilum# Figure 2 Flowchart of management technical difculties. (B) <Following failed NA, small-bore ( <14 F) chest drain insertion is recommended. (A) <Large-bore chest drains are not needed for pneumo- thorax. (D) Needle aspiration (NA) was recommended in the previous guidelines1722as the initial intervention for PSP on the basis of studies59 60showing equivalent success to the insertion of large- bore chest drains, although this was not shown in another study.61Seldinger (catheter over guide wire) chest drains have entered widespread usage since then and further studies have been published. A randomised controlled trial in a Kuwaiti population has con rmed equivalence between NA and chest drains (16 Fr), plus a reduction in hospital admission and length of stay for NA.62A smaller study in India has also con rmed equivalence.63T wo recent case series have reported NA success rates of 69%64and 50.5%.65Several meta-analyses66e68were limited by the small numbers of patients and studies69e77but conrm equivalence, with NA success rates ranging from 30% to 80% (see evidence table available on the BTS website www.brit- thoracic.org.uk). If undertaken, NA should cease after 2.5 l of air has been aspirated, further re-expansion being unlikely59because of the likely presence of a persistent air leak. Guidelines that encourage NA are not always followed78e82 and the ease of insertion of small-bore ( <14 F) Seldinger chest drains may be regarded as a simpler option to NA. Their success has been documented in several studies,83e89the attachment of Heimlich valves facilitating mobilisation and outpatient care. Small-bore chest drains have been shown to have a similar success rate to larger drains90while being less painful,91 92but there have been no randomised controlled trials comparing them with NA. More detail on chest drain insertion and management and complications of chest drain insertion are found in the guideline on pleural procedures. Catheter aspiration was described in the last guideline,22with success in up to 59%, and further improvement with the addition of Heimlich valves and suction.93e95Seldinger chest drains have also permitted a 'step- wise 'approach to PSP management, following a prede ned pathway that culminates in surgical referral where there is a persistent air leak.96 The choice of initial intervention for PSP should take into account operator experience and patient choice; NA is less painful than chest drain insertion60but failure in approximately one-third of patients will require a second procedure. Other national and consensus guidelines recommend either NA or small-bore chest drain insertion,97or chest drain insertion alone.49We believe that NA remains the procedure of rst choice in most cases. Repeat NA is unlikely to be successful unless there were technical dif culties such as a blocked or kinked catheter. There is some limited evidence that VATS is the preferred 'salvage 'strategy after failed NA,98but this is not the usual practice currently in the UK where small-bore chest drain insertion is usually employed. Following successful NA, the patient can be considered for hospital discharge. Suction <Suction should not be routinely employed. (B) <Caution is required because of the risk of RPO. (B) <High-volume low-pressure suction systems are recom- mended. (C) A persistent air leak with or without incomplete re-expansion of the lung is the usual reason for consideration of the use of suction, although there is no evidence for its routine use.99e101Itis arbitrarily de ned as the continued bubbling of air through a chest drain after 48 h in situ. A retrospective review of 142 cases of pneumothorax102found a median time to resolution of 8 days which was not related to the initial size of pneumo- thorax, but longer for SSP. A persistent air leak was observed in 43 cases, 30 of which were treated with suction. The theory that underpins the role of suction is that air might be removed from the pleural cavity at a rate that exceeds the egress of air through the breach in the visceral pleura and to subsequently promote healing by apposition of the visceral and parietal pleural layers. It has been suggested that optimal suction should entail pres- sures of /C010 to /C020 cm H 2O (compared normal intra- pleural pressures of between /C03.4 and /C08c mH 2O, according to the respiratory cycle), with the capacity to increase the air flow volume to 15 e20 l/min.103Other forms of suction are not recommended. High-pressure high-volume suction may lead to air stealing, hypoxaemia or the perpetuation of air leaks.104 Likewise, high-pressure low-volume systems should be avoided.105High-volume low-pressure systems such as Vernon- Thompson pumps or wall suction with low pressure adaptors are therefore recommended. The addition of suction too early after chest drain insertion may precipitate RPO, especially in the case of a PSP that may have been present for more than a few days,106and is thought to be due to the additional mechanical stress applied to capillaries that are already 'leaky '.107The clinical manifestations are cough, breathlessness and chest tightness after chest drain insertion. The incidence may be up to 14% (higher in younger patients with a large PSP), although no more than a radiological phenomenon in the majority of cases.106Sometimes pulmonary oedema is evident in the contralateral lung.108Fatalities have been reported in as many as 20% of 53 cases in one series,108so caution should be exercised in this particular group of patients. Specialist referral <Referral to a respiratory physician should be made within 24 h of admission. (C) <Complex drain management is best effected in areas where specialist medical and nursing expertise is avail- able. (D) Failure of a pneumothorax to re-expand or a persistent air leak should prompt early referral to a respiratory physician, prefer- ably within the rst 24 h. Such patients may require prolonged chest drainage with complex drain management (suction, chest drain repositioning) and liaison with thoracic surgeons. Drain management is also best delivered by nurses with specialist expertise. Surgical referral is discussed in a later section. Surgical emphysema This is a well-recognised complication of chest drainage.109 Generally it is of cosmetic importance only, although alarming for patients and their relatives, and subsides spontaneously after a few days. It is usually seen in the context of a malpositioned, kinked, blocked or clamped chest drain. It can also occur with an imbalance between a large air leak and a relatively small-bore chest drain. Occasionally, acute airway obstruction or thoracic compression may lead to respiratory compromise109 110in which case tracheostomy, skin incision decompression and insertion of large-bore chest drains have all been used.109For most, the treatment is conservative. Management of SSP <All patients with SSP should be admitted to hospital for at least 24 h and receive supplemental oxygen in ii22 Thorax 2010; 65(Suppl 2):ii18 eii31. doi:10.1136/thx.2010.136986BTS guidelinescompliance with guidelines on the use of oxygen. (D) <Most patients will require the insertion of a small-bore chest drain. (B) <All patients will require early referral to a chest physician. (D) <Those with a persistent air leak should be discussed with a thoracic surgeon at 48 h. (B) As stated previously, SSP is less likely to be tolerated by patients than PSP because of co-existing lung disease. Furthermore, the air leak is less likely to settle spontane- ously,111 112so that most patients will require active inter- vention. Oxygen is indicated,56 57but caution is required for patients with carbon dioxide retention.113Aspiration is less likely to be successful in SSP (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk) but can be consid- ered in symptomatic patients w ith small pneumothoraces in an attempt to avoid chest drain insertion. Otherwise, the inser- tion of a small-bore chest drain is recommended, a study in SSP114having found equivalent success to the use of large drains. Early referral to a chest physician is encouraged for all patients with SSP, both for management of the pneumothorax and also of the underlying lung disease. Similarly, those with a persistent air leak should be discussed with a thoracic surgeon after 48 h,112 115even though many will resolve spontaneously if managed conservatively for as long as 14 days.111 Patients with SSP but unt for surgery <Medical pleurodesis may be appropriate for inoperable patients. (D) <Patients with SSP can be considered for ambulatory management with a Heimlich valve. (D) These patients are at heightened risk of a persistent air leak but may not be t for surgical intervention by virtue of the severity of their underlying lung disease, or they may be unwilling to proceed. Their optimal management is challenging and requires close medical and surgical liaison. Medical pleurodesis is an option for such patients, as is ambulatory management with the use of a Heimlich valve.86 DISCHARGE AND FOLLOW-UP <Patients should be advised to return to hospital if increasing breathlessness develops. (D) <All patients should be followed up by respiratory physicians until full resolution. (D) <Air travel should be avoided until full resolution. (C) <Diving should be permanently avoided unless the patient has undergone bilateral surgical pleurectomy and has normal lung function and chest CT scan postoperatively. (C) All patients discharged after active treatment or otherwise should be given verbal and written advice to return to the Accident and Emergency department immediately should they develop further breathlessness. It is recommended that all patients should be followed up by a respiratory physician to ensure resolution of the pneumothorax, to institute optimal care of any underlying lung disease, to explain the risk of recurrence and the possible later need for surgical intervention and to reinforce lifestyle advice on issues such as smoking and air travel. Those managed by observation alone or by NA should be advised to return for a follow-up chest x-ray after 2 e4 weeks to monitor resolution. Those with successful lung re-expansion before hospital discharge will also require early review because recurrence may occur relatively early.Since there is no evidence to link recurrence with physical exertion, the patient can be advised to return to work and to resume normal physical activities once all symptoms have resolved, although it is reasonable to advise that sports that involve extreme exertion and physical contact should be deferred until full resolution. Patients should be made aware of the danger of air travel in the presence of a current closed pneu- mothorax, and should be cautioned against commercial flights at high altitude until full resolution of the pneumothorax has been conrmed by a chest x-ray. While there is no evidence that air travel per se precipitates pneumothorax recurrence, the conse- quences of a recurrence during air travel may be serious. Many commercial airlines previously advised arbitrarily a 6-week interval between the pneumothorax event and air travel, but this has since been amended to a period of 1 week after full resolution. The BTS guidelines on air travel116emphasise that the recurrence risk only signi cantly falls after a period of 1 year from the index pneumothorax so that, in the absence of ad enitive surgical procedure, patients with SSP in particular may decide to minimise the risk by deferring air travel accord- ingly. After a pneumothorax, diving should be discouraged permanently117unless a very secure de nitive prevention strategy has been performed such as surgical pleurectomy. The BTS guidelines on respiratory aspects of tness for diving118deal with this in greater detail. Smoking in fluences the risk of recurrence,12 15so cessation should be advised. Pregnancy is an issue to be discussed with younger female patients. MEDICAL CHEMICAL PLEURODESIS <Chemical pleurodesis can control dif cult or recurrent pneumothoraces (A) but, since surgical options are more effective, it should only be used if a patient is either unwilling or unable to undergo surgery. (B) <Chemical pleurodesis for pneumothorax should only be performed by a respiratory specialist. (C) Chemical pleurodesis has generally been advocated by respira- tory physicians experienced in thoracoscopy. The instillation of substances into the pleural space should lead to an aseptic inflammation, with dense adhesi ons leading ultimately to pleural symphysis. There is a signi cant rate of recurrence of both primary and secondary pneumothoraces,12and efforts to reduce recurrence by instilling various sclerosants deither via a chest drain, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or open surgery dare often undertaken without clear guidelines to direct physicians in their use. In the vast majority of cases the prevention of recurrent pneumothoraces should be undertaken surgically using either an open or VATS approach, as the rate of recurrence following surgical pleurodesis via thoracotomy or VATS is far less than following simple medical pleurodesis with chemical agents,32 119 e121although direct comparative trials are lacking. A small number of patients are either too frail or are unwilling to undergo any surgical treatment and, in these situations, medical chemical pleurodesis may be appropriate. Many sclerosing agents suitable for instillation into the pleural space have been studied.32119 122 e125T etracycline used to be recommended as the rst-line sclerosant therapy for both primary and secondary pneumothoraces as it proved to be the most effective sclerosant in animal models.123 126 127Recently, however, parenteral tetracycline for pleurodesis has become more dif cult to obtain owing to problems with the manufacturing process. Minocycline and doxycycline have also been shown to be reasonable alternative sclerosing agents in is the primary indi- cator for success for any recurrence prevention techniques. Although tetracycline has been shown to reduce the incidence of early recurrence, the incidence of late recurrence remains at 10e20% which is unacceptably high when compared with surgical methods of pleurodesis.119121 125 128 129T etracycline can be recommended for recurrent primary and secondary pneumo- thorax when surgery is not an option, and graded talc may also be used on the grounds that it is the most effective agent in treating malignant pleural effusion and is also commonly used for surgical chemical pleurodesis.130e133There is con flicting evidence as to whether tetracycline is effective for the treatment of a fully expanded pneumothorax with a persistent air leak.32 134 135The largest of these studies, the Veterans Administration Study, did not support the use of intrapleural tetracycline to facilitate the closure of a persistent air leak.31Macoviak and colleagues135 suggest that intrapleural tetracycline can facilitate the closure of a persistent air leak provided the lung can be kept expanded so that symphysis can occur. Likewise, there is con flicting evidence as to whether intrapleural tetracycline shortens the length of stay in hospital with pneumothorax.32 119 125 The dosage of intrapleural tetracycline requires clari cation. Almind119found a reduction in the recurrence rate in a group receiving 500 mg tetracycline via chest drains compared with those treated by tube drainage alone. This reduction was not signicant. The Veterans Administration Study,32which used 1500 mg tetracycline, showed a signi cant reduction in the recurrence rate of pneumothorax without signi cant extra morbidity. This dose of intrapleural tetracycline is therefore recommended as the standard dose for medical pleurodesis. While pain was reported more frequently in the group treated with tetracycline at a dose of 1500 mg,32others have reported no increase in pain with doses of 500 mg provided adequate anal- gesia is given.119Adequate analgesia may be achieved with the administration of intrapleural local anaesthesia. Standard doses (200 mg (20 ml) of 1% lidocaine) are signi cantly less effective than larger doses (250 mg (25 ml) of 1% lidocaine), the higher doses having been shown to increase the number of pain-free episodes from 10% to 70% with no appreciable toxicity.136 Chemical pleurodesis using graded talc is an effective alter- native to tetracycline pleurodesis, but there are no controlled trials comparing the two in the treatment of pneumothorax. The issue of talc pleurodesis is discussed in the later section on surgical chemical pleurodesis as most trials using talc relate to its use in either thoracoscopic or open surgical techniques. Since we recognise chemical pleurodesis as an inferior option to surgical pleurodesis, we recommend that chemical pleurodesis should be undertaken by respiratory physicians or thoracic surgeons only. REFERRAL TO THORACIC SURGEONS <In cases of persistent air leak or failure of the lung to re- expand, an early (3 e5 days) thoracic surgical opinion should be sought. (C) There is no evidence on which to base the ideal timing for thoracic surgical intervention in cases of persistent air leak. A cut- off point of 5 days has been widely advocated in the past55but is arbitrary. Chee et al111showed that 100% of primary pneumo- thoraces with a persistent air leak for >7 days and treated by tube drainage had resolved by 14 days. Also, 79% of those with secondary pneumothoraces and a persistent air leak had resolved by 14 days, with no mortality in either group. However, surgical intervention carries a low morbidity128 129 137 e140and post- surgical recurrence rates are low.128 129Surgical intervention as early as 3 days has advocates,141 142but there is no evidence thatintervention before 5 days is necessary for PSP. Each case should be assessed individually on its own merit. Patients with pneu- mothoraces should be managed by a respiratory physician, and a thoracic surgical opinion will often form an early part of the management plan. Accepted indications for surgical advice should be as follows: leak (despite 5 e7 days of chest tube drainage) or failure of lung re-expansion. <Spontaneous haemothorax.143 144 <Professions at risk (eg, pilots, divers).111 138 145 e147 <Pregnancy. Increasingly, patient choice will play a part in decision- making, and even those without an increased risk in the event of a pneumothorax because of their profession may elect to undergo surgical repair after their rst pneumothorax,148 149 weighing the bene ts of a reduced recurrence risk against that of chronic pain,150paraesthesia151or the possibility of increased costs.152 Surgical strategies: open remain proce- with the lowest recurrence rate (approximately 1%) for dif cult or recurrent pneumothoraces. (A) <Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with pleurectomy and pleural abrasion is better tolerated but has a higher recurrence rate of approximately 5%. (A) There are two main objectives in the surgical repair of persistent air leak from a pneumothorax and in the prevention of recur- rence. The rst objective is to resect any visible bullae or blebs on the also to obliterate emphysema-like pleural porosities under the surface of the visceral pleura.8The second objective is to create a symphysis between the two opposing pleural surfaces as an additional means of preventing recurrence. In the past, surgeons have tended to favour a surgical pleurodesis with pleural abrasion while others have stressed the importance of various degrees of pleurectomy in recurrence prevention.137 153 154Although there may be slight advantages of pleurectomy over pleural abrasion,137a combina- tion of the two is often used.155e158Unfortunately there is a paucity of good comparative case-controlled studies in this area.128 129In recent years, less invasive procedures using VATS have become more popular with lower morbidity although with slightly higher recurrence rates. Open thoracotomy with pleural abrasion was the original surgical treatment for pneumothorax, described by T yson and Crandall in 1941.159In 1956 introduced the visceral the wall.153Closure of the leaking visceral pleura with direct cautery and li gation or suture of associated blebs147is also thought to be important. Although open thoracotomy has the lowest pneumothorax recurrence rates, there are also lesser surgical procedures with comparable recurrence rates but less morbidity.160These include trans- axillary minithoracotomy, using a 5 e6 cm incision in the axillary margin with apical pleurectomy and pleural abrasion, introduced in the 1970s.161Open thoracotomy is generally performed with a limited posterolateral approach and single lung ventilation. This allows for a parietal pleurectomy with excision, stapling or ligation of visible bullae during a VATS procedure.163e165Meta-analyses of studies comparing open with limited or VATS procedures128 129have shown lower recurrence rates (approximately 1%) with open procedures but greater blood loss, more postoperative pain166and longer hospital stays.167Some non-randomised studies have found no signicant differences.168 169A complicated meta-analysis of three retrospective studies and one prospective study comparing the cost of open thoracotomy versus VATS (not exclusively for pneumothoraces) concluded that the total economic cost of VATS was lower,170and it can be undertaken without general anaesthesia.149There is a need for better quality prospective randomised studies in this area. Several authors suggest that VATS offers a signi cant advantage over open thoracotomy, including a sh orter postoperative hospital stay,145 162 167 171 e173less postoperative pain160 162 166 174 175 and improved pulmonary gas exchange postoperatively,176 although not all trials have con rmed shorter hospital stays with VATS.169 177 Much of the literature contains heterogeneous comparisons between PSP and SSP, but the most recent 'clinical bottom line '129concludes that VATS pleurectomy is comparable to open pleurectomy, with several randomised controlled trials showing reductions in length of hospital stay, analgesic requirement and postoperative pulmonary dysfunction. Clearly this needs to be weighed against the slight increase in recurrence rate when using a less invasive approach.128 Surgical chemical pleurodesis <Surgical chemical pleurodesis is best achieved by using 5 g sterile graded talc, with which the complications of adult respiratory distress syndrome and empyema are rare. (A) With the advent of VATS for pneumothorax repair and recur- rence prevention, the use of surgical chemical pleurodesis has declined signi cantly. Previous reports have shown that talc can achieve pleurodesis successfully in 85 e90% of cases, similar to other thoracoscopic techniques for complicated pneumo- thorax.121 145 171 178 179A meta-analysis of the success rates of talc pleurodesis in the treatment of pneumothorax shows an overall success rate of 91%.178Graded talc is preferable to tetra- cycline, which is less available now, and is associated with much higher recurrence rates.120Much of the literature concerning the use of talc in achieving pleurodesis relates to its use in the control of malignant pleural effusions, although talc poudrage has been used successfully in secondary pneumothoraces.180On the basis of a systematic review of uncontrolled trials, 5 g of intrapleural talc via VATS achieves a success rate of 87%.178 The adult respiratory distress syndrome has been described following the use of talc. This probably relates to the size of the talc particles181and is unlikely to occur with the use of graded talc.182 183If talc is correctly sterilised, the incidence of empyema is very low.178 184 185There does not appear to be a difference between talc poudrage and talc slurry pleurodesis. The advent of successful and well-tolerated VATS surgery will lead to less use of surgical chemical pleurodesis with talc. In those patients who are either unwilling or too unwell to undergo a VATS procedure, then medical pleurodesis with talc via a chest drain would be the preferred option. TENSION PNEUMOTHORAX <Tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency that requires heightened awareness in a speci c range of clinical situations. (D)<Treatment is with oxygen and emergency needle decompression. (D) <A standard cannula may be insuf ciently long if used in the second intercostal space. (D) This is a medical emergency that can arise in a variety of clinical situations, so a high index of suspicion is required in order to make the correct diagnosis and to manage it effec- tively. The most frequent situations are shown in box 1, although the list does not include all eventualities. It arises as a result of the development of a one-way valve system at the site of the breach in the pleural membrane, permitting air to enter the pleural cavity during inspiration but preventing egress of air during expiration, with consequent increase in the intrapleural pressure such that it exceeds atmospheric pressure for much of the respiratory cycle. As a result, impaired venous return and reduced cardiac output results in the typical features of hypoxaemia and haemodynamic compromise.186 187 A recent review188has emphasised the important differences between the presentation in ventilated and non-ventilated patients, where it is typically seen after trauma or resuscitation. The former group is associated with a uniformly rapid presen- tation with hypotension, tachycardia, falling oxygen saturation and cardiac output, increased in flation pressures and cardiac arrest. This is frequently missed in the ICU setting37and can also occur after nasal non-invasive ventilation (NIV). The latter group of awake patients show a greater variability of presenta- tions which are generally progressive with slower decompensa- tion. T achypnoea, tachycardia and hypoxaemia lead eventually to respiratory arrest. Apart from these general physical signs, the most frequent lateralising sign found in a review of 18 case reports188was that of decreased air entry (50 e75%), with signs of tracheal deviation, hyperexpansion, hypomobility and hyperresonance present only in the minority. In neither group is imaging especially helpful; there is usually insuf cient time to obtain a chest x -ray and, even if available, the size of the pneumothorax or the presence of mediastinal d i s p l a c e m e n tc o r r e l a t ep o o r l yw i t ht h ep r e s e n c eo ft e n s i o n within a pneumothorax. However, a chest x-ray can, when time is available, con rm the presence of a pneumothorax (if uncertain) and the correct side. Treatment is with high concentration oxygen and emergency needle decompression, a cannula usually being introduced in the second anterior intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. The instantaneous egress of air through the majority of the respira- tory cycle is an important con rmation of the diagnosis and the correct lateralisation. A standard 14 gauge (4.5 cm) cannula may not be long enough to penetrate the parietal pleura, however, with up to one-third of patients having a chest wall thickness Box 1 Typical clinical situations where tension pneumothorax arises 1. Ventilated patients on ICU. 2. Trauma patients. 3. Resuscitation patients (CPR). 4. Lung disease, especially acute presentations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 5. Blocked, clamped or displaced chest drains. 6. Patients receiving non-invasive ventilation (NIV). 7. Miscellaneous group, for example patients undergoing hyperbaric second interspace.189The chest wall may be less deep in the fourth or fth interspace, and this could provide an alternative site for decompression or a chest drain may need to be inserted if there is an initial treatment failure. In any case, a chest drain should be inserted immediately after needle decompression and the cannula left in place until bubbling is conrmed in the underwater seal system to con rm proper function of the chest drain.186 PNEUMOTHORAX AND PREGNANCY <Pneumothorax recurrence is more common in preg- nancy, poses risks to the mother and fetus, and requires close cooperation between chest physicians, obstetri- cians and thoracic surgeons. (C) <The modern and less invasive strategies of simple observation and aspiration are usually effective during pregnancy, with elective assisted delivery and regional anaesthesia at or near term. (C) <A corrective surgical procedure (VATS) should be considered after delivery. (D) Although less common in women than in men, the occurrence of PSP in women of childbearing age is not unusual. There appears to be an increased risk of recurrence during pregnancy and during parturition,190with potential risks to the mother and fetus. The earlier literature consists largely of case reports and described varied and relatively invasive management strategies such as prolonged intrapartum chest tube drainage, intrapartum thoracotomy, premature induction of labour or caesarean section. A more recent case series and literature review191has recommended the use of more modern conservative manage- ment methods for which favourable outcomes have now been experienced. Pneumothorax that occurs during pregnancy can be managed by simple observation if the mother is not dyspnoeic, there is no fetal distress and the pneumothorax is small ( <2 cm). Otherwise aspiration can be performed, chest drain insertion being reserved for those with a persistent air leak. Close cooperation between the respiratory physician, obste- trician and thoracic surgeon is essential. T o avoid spontaneous delivery or caesarean section, both of which have been associated with an increased risk of recurrence, the safest approach will usually be that of elective assisted delivery (forceps or ventouse extraction) at or near term, with regional (epidural) anaesthesia. Less maternal effort is required with forceps delivery, which is therefore preferable. If caesarean section is unavoidable because of obstetric considerations, then a spinal anaesthetic is preferable to a general anaesthetic. Because of the risk of recurrence in subsequent pregnancies, a minimally invasive VATS surgical procedure should be considered after convalescence. Successful pregnancies and spontaneous deliveries without pneumothorax recurrence have been reported after a VATS procedure.191 pneumothorax. (C) <A combination of surgical intervention and hormonal manipulation requires cooperation with thoracic surgeons and gynaecologists. (D) Catamenial is a term that derives from the Greek meaning 'monthly '. The typical combination of chest pain, dyspnoea and haemoptysis occurring within 72 h before or after menstruation in young women has been thought to be relatively rare. There are approximately 250 cases described in the medical literature,192but it is likely that the majority of cases are not reported. Most of these references are of solitary case reports or small series. The associated pneumothorax is usually right-sided and there is a heightened tendency to recurrence coinciding with the menstrual cycle. Many cases have evidence of pelvic endometri- osis. Although the aetiology is not fully understood, inspection of the pleural diaphragmatic surface at thoracoscopy often reveals defects (termed fenestrations) as well as small endometrial deposits. These deposits have also been seen on the visceral pleural surface. Among women undergoing routine surgical treatment for recurrent pneumothorax, however, catamenial pneumothorax has been diagnosed in as many as 25%.193Thus, it may be relatively underdiagnosed. Extragenital or 'ectopic 'endometriosis is an uncommon condition that can affect almost any organ system and tissue within the body, the thorax being the most frequent extrapelvic location. What has been termed the thoracic endometriosis syndrome (TES) includes catamenial pneumothorax, catamenial haemothorax, catamenial haemoptysis and lung nodules (purple or brown coloured). The most accepted theory to explain the phenomenon of catamenial pneumothorax is that of aspiration of air from the abdomen and genital tract via the diaphragmatic fenestrations, but the appearance of endometriosis deposits on the visceral pleural surface raises the possibility that erosion of the visceral pleura might be an alternative mechanism. Haemoptysis is thought to result from intrapulmonary endo- metriosis deposits, the mechanism by which endometrial tissue reaches the lung being poorly understood. The management strategies can be divided into thoracic surgical techniques and hormonal manipulation although, in the past, total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingohys- terectomy have been employed. Thoracic surgical techniques have been varied and include diaphragmatic resection or plica- tion of the fenestrations seen at thoracoscopy, the insertion of a mesh or patch over these fenestrations, electrocoagulation of the endometriosis deposits and pleurodesis. This variability reflects the general lack of success with surgical intervention alone, recurrence rates of up to 30% being documented.194When combined with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues amenorrhoea results, but recurrence has been avoided with follow-up approaching periods of 4 years.195Successful patient management requires close cooperation between respiratory physicians, thoracic surgeons and gynaecologists. PNEUMOTHORAX AND AIDS <The combination of pneumothorax and HIV infection requires early intercostal tube drainage and surgical referral, in addition to appropriate treatment for HIV and PJP infection. (C) Over the course of the last 20 years a strong association has been observed between HIV infection and pneumothorax. Historically, up to 5% of AIDS patients developed pneumo- thorax196e198and up to 25% of spontaneous pneumothoraces occurred in HIV-infected patients in large urban settings where a high prevalence occurred.27 28 199Pneumocystis jiroveci (PJP)d previously known as Pneumocystis carinii (PCP)dinfection has been considered to be the main aetiological factor for this association, because of a severe form of necrotising alveolitis that occurs in which the subpleural pulmonary parenchyma is replaced by necrotic thin-walled cysts and pneumatoceles.200 201 The administration of nebulised pentamidine has also been suggested as a possible independent risk factor.196The use of systemic corticosteroids may also contribute to the pneumothoraces caused by PJP have a tendency to more prolonged air leaks, treatment failure, recurrence and higher hospital mortality.203 Up to 40% of these patients can develop bilateral pneumo- thorax. Treatment failures have been observed to correlate with the degree of immunosuppression, as re flected by CD4 counts.203In view of these features, management strategies have been evolved that incorporate early and aggressive intervention including tube drainage, pleurodesis and surgical techniques such as pleurectomy.197 199 202 e205Observation and simple aspiration are not likely to suf ce, even in the rst instance. Over the last 5 years, and since the last BTS guidelines, the global spectrum of HIV infection has changed signi cantly as a result of the more widespread use of both antiretroviral therapy and PJP prophylaxis. While the disease burden remains very high in the underdeveloped world, the prognosis for such patients in Western societies has greatly improved,206where this combination is now much less frequently encountered. As HIV is now becoming a more chronic disease associated with a high incidence of smoking and therefore of COPD, pneumothoraces might become more signi cant when they occur. However, the mortality of patients who require intensive care for PJP in HIV infection remains high, especially when pneu- mothorax occurs during ventilation. Although antiretroviral therapy that is commenced before or during hospitalisation can improve the outcome,207the potential risk of the 'immune reconstitution syndrome 'has to be taken into consideration. PNEUMOTHORAX AND CYSTIC FIBROSIS <The development of a pneumothorax in a patient with cystic brosis requires early and aggressive treatment with early surgical referral. (C) <Pleural procedures, including pleurodesis, do not have a signi cant adverse effect on the outcome of subse- quent lung transplantation. (D) Even though long-term survival has improved signi cantly, spon- taneous pneumothorax remains a common complication of cystic brosis, occurring in 0.64% of patients per annum and 3.4% of patients overall.208It occurs more commonly in older patients and those with more advanced lung disease, and is associated with a poor prognosis, the median survival being 30 months.209Contra- lateral pneumothoraces occur in up to 40% of patients.209 210An increased morbidity also results, with increased hospitalisation and a measurable decline in lung function.208While a small pneumothorax without symptoms can be observed or aspirated, larger pneumothoraces require a chest drain. The collapsed lung can be stiff and associated with sputum retention, thus requiring a longer time to re-expand. During this time other general measures, such as appropriate antibiotic treatment, are needed. Chest tube drainage alone has a recurrence rate of 50%, but interventions such as pleurectomy, pleural abrasion and pleu- rodesis have lower rates.211e213With a success rate of 95% and with little associated reduction in pulmonary function, partial pleurectomy is generally regarded as the treatment of choice in patients with cystic brosis and recurrent pneumothoraces who are t to undergo surgery.209In those who are not t for surgery and in whom re-expansion may take several weeks with a chest drain and suction, pleurodesis offers an alternative strategy.209This had been thought to be a relative contraindi- cation to later transplantation because of the need for a lengthier transplant procedure and excessive bleeding.214A more recent study215has concluded that previous pleural procedures should not be considered as a contraindication for transplantation, there being no signi cant effect on surgicaloutcome although more dense pleural adhesions were observed than in a control population. IATROGENIC PNEUMOTHORAX Iatrogenic pneumothorax has been shown to be even more common than spontaneous pneumothorax in several large reviews,216 217the most common causes being a complication of transbronchial biopsy. During transthoracic needle aspiration the two primary risk factors are the depth of the lesion and the presence of COPD.219A large retrospective survey in the USA found an incidence of 2.68% among patients undergoing thoracocentesis.220No means of reducing this risk has yet been identi ed. Positioning of the patient so that the procedure is performed in a dependent area has had no benecial effect.221Excluding iatrogenic penumothorax that occurs in intensive care units, the treatment seems to be relatively simple with less likelihood of recurrence (the underlying risk factors for SP not usually being present). The majority resolve spontaneously by observation alone. If intervention is required, simple aspiration has been shown to be effective in 89% of patients.94For the remainder a chest drain is required, this being more likely in patients with COPD.222 In the intensive care unit iatrogenic pneumothorax is a life- threatening complication that may be seen in up to 3% of patients.223Those on positive pressure ventilation require chest drain insertion as positive pressure maintains the air leak.224 CONCLUDING REMARKS These pneumothorax guidelines differ from the last (2003) BTS guidelines in that they have been produced in accordance with the SIGN methodology and therefore have necessitated a careful analysis of the current underlying evidence. Unfortunately there are relatively few adequate studies that address the main areas of uncertainty, and few additions to the knowledge base in the last 7 years. Nevertheless, some subtle changes in practice have occurred. These are incorporated, together with coverage of some additional topics of relevance such as catamenial pneumothorax and the issue of pneumothorax in pregnancy. The treatment algorithm is now illustrated on a single flowchart for both PSP and SSP and places slightly less emphasis on the size of the pneumothorax and more on the clinical features. However, the trend towards more conservative management is maintained, with observation for many patients with PSP, aspiration for the remainder, and small- bore chest drains for persistent air leaks. The imaging of pneu- mothorax has undergone a major change due to the advent of PACS technology, and the implications of this are now described. Surgical practice has also developed with the widespread adoption of less invasive (VATS) procedures rather than open thoracoto- mies. While the challenge of pneumothorax management in patients with cystic brosis remains, there has been a signi cant reduction in pneumothorax in patients with HIV since the introduction of antiretroviral therapy and PJP prophylactic therapy, in the countries with advanced healthcare systems at least. It is hoped that these guidelines build upon their predeces- sors and lead to improved care for patients with pneumothorax, and that they inform and support the clinicians who care for them.

Berrisford,3George Nabeel J Ali1, on behalf of the BTS Pleural Disease Guideline Group INTRODUCTION The discovery of malignant cells in pleural fluid and/or parietal pleura signi es disseminated or advanced disease and a reduced life expectancy in patients with cancer.1Median survival following diagnosis ranges from 3 to 12 months and is dependent on the stage and type of the underlying malignancy. The shortest survival time is observed in malignant effusions secondary to lung cancer and the longest in ovarian cancer, while malignant effusions due to an unknown primary have an intermediate survival time.2e6Historically, studies showed that median survival times in effusions due to carcinoma of the breast are 5 e6 months. However, more recent studies have suggested longer survival times of up to 15 months.7e10A comparison of survival times in breast cancer effusions in published studies to 1994 calculated a median survival of 11 months.9 Currently, lung cancer is the most common metastatic tumour to the pleura in men and breast cancer in women.411T ogether, both malignancies account for 50 e65% of all effusions (table 1). Lymphomas, tumours of the genito- urinary tract gastrointestinal tract account for a further 25%.21 2e14Pleural effusions from an unknown primary are responsible for 7 e15% of all malignant pleural effusions.31 31 4Few studies have estimated the proportion of pleural effusions due to mesothelioma: studies from 1975, 1985 and 1987 identi ed mesothelioma in 1/271, 3/472 and 22/592 patients, respectively, but there are no more recent data to update this in light of the increasing inci- dence of mesothelioma.41 31 4 Attempts have been made to predict survival based on the clinical characteristics of pleural fluid. None has shown a de nite correlation: a recent systematic review of studies including 433 patients assessing the predictive value of pH concluded that low pH does not reliably predict a survival of <3 months.15 16In malignant mesothelioma, one study has shown an association between increasing pH and increasing survival.17Burrows et al showed that only performance status was signi cantly associated with mortality: median survival was 1.1 months with a Karnofsky score <30 and 13.2 months with a score >70.18 An algorithm for the management of malignant pleural effusions is shown in gure 1. CLINICAL PRESENTATION <The majority of malignant effusions are symptomatic. (C) <Massive pleural effusions are most commonly due to malignancy. (C)The majority of patients who present with a malignant pleural effusion are symptomatic, although up to 25% are asymptomatic with an incidental nding of effusion on physical exami- nation or by chest radiography.1Dyspnoea is the most common presenting symptom, re flecting reduced compliance of the chest wall, depression of the ipsilateral diaphragm, mediastinal shift and reduction in lung volume.19Chest pain is less common and is usually related to malignant involvement of the parietal pleura, ribs and other intercostal structures. Constitutional symptoms including weight loss, malaise and anorexia gener- ally accompany respiratory symptoms. A massive pleural effusion is de ned as complete or almost complete opaci cation of a hemithorax on the chest x-ray. It is usually symptomatic and is commonly associated with a malignant cause.20 The diagnosis of a malignant pleural effusion is discussed in the guideline on the investigation of a unilateral pleural effusion. MANAGEMENT OPTIONS Treatment options for malignant pleural effusions are determined by several factors: symptoms and performance status of the patient, the primary tumour type and its response to systemic therapy, and degree of lung re-expansion following pleural fluid evacuation. Although small cell lung cancer, lymphoma and breast cancer usually respond to chemotherapy, associated secondary pleural effu- sions may require intervention during the course of treatment ( gure 1). Malignant pleural effusions are often most effectively managed by complete drainage of the effusion and instillation of a scle- rosant to promote pleurodesis and prevent recur- rence of the effusion. Options for management include observation, therapeutic pleural aspiration, intercostal tube drainage and instillation of scle- and or placement of an indwelling pleural catheter. Observation <Observation is recommended if the patient is asymptomatic and the tumour type is known. (C) <Advice should be sought from the respira- tory team and/or respiratory multidisci- plinary team for symptomatic malignant effusions. ( U) The majority of these patients will become symp- tomatic in due course and require further interven- tion. There is no evidence that initial thoracentesis carried out according to standard techniques will1Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, UK 2Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust, UK and Exeter NHS Trust, UK 4South Tees NHS Foundation Trust, UK Correspondence to Dr Nabeel J Ali, Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, in Asheld NG17 4JL, UK; nabeel.ali@sfh-tr.nhs.uk Received 2010; 65(Suppl effective pleurodesis after tube drainage. However, repeated thoracentesis may limit the scope for thoracoscopic intervention as it often leads to the formation of adhesions between the parietal and visceral pleura. Therapeutic pleural effusions treated by aspiration alone are asso- ciated with a high rate of recurrence of effusion at 1 month so aspiration is not recommended if life expectancy is >1 month. (A) <Caution should be taken if removing >1.5 l on a single occasion. (C) Repeated therapeutic pleural aspiration provides transient relief of symptoms and avoids hospitalisation for patients with limited survival expectancy and poor performance status. It is appropriate for frail or terminally ill patients. However, as small- bore chest tubes are widely available, effective and may beinserted with minimal discomfort,21e26they may be preferable. The amount of fluid evacuated by pleural aspiration will be guided by patient symptoms (cough, chest discomfort)27and should be limited to 1.5 l on a single occasion. Pleural aspiration alone and intercostal tube drainage without instillation of a sclerosant are associated with a high recurrence rate and a small risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax and empyema.28e36 Therapeutic pleural aspiration should take place under ultra- sound guidance (see guideline on pleural procedures). Intercostal tube drainage and intrapleural instillation of sclerosant <Other than in patients with a very short life expectancy, small-bore chest tubes followed by pleurodesis are preferable to recurrent aspiration. ( U) <Intercostal drainage should be followed by pleurodesis to prevent recurrence unless lung is signi cantly trapped. (A) Pleurodesis is thought to occur through a diffuse in flammatory reaction and local activation of the coagulation system with brin deposition.3738Increased pleural brinolytic activity is associated with failure of pleurodesis, as is extensive tumour involvement of the pleura.39 40Intercostal drainage without pleurodesis is asso- ciated with a high rate of effusion recurrence and should be avoided (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www. brit-thoracic.org.uk). A suggested method for undertaking pleu- rodesis is shown in box 1. In animals the effectiveness of pleurodesis may be reduced by concomitant use of corticosteroids. Recent evidence in rabbits has shown reduced pleural in flammatory reaction and, in some cases, prevention of pleurodesis with administration of cortico- steroids at the time of talc pleurodesis.41A subgroup analysis comparing the ef cacy of pleurodesis in the presence and absence of non-randomised oral corticosteroid use also suggested a negative effect the time of pleurodesis is more contentious. Animal studies have suggested that the use of NSAIDs may impair the action of pleurodesis agents, but there is no evidence from human studies.43 Size of intercostal tube <Small-bore (10 e14 F) intercostal catheters should be the initial choice for effusion drainage and pleurodesis. (A) Conventional large-bore intercostal tubes (24 e32 F) have been employed in most studies involving sclerosing agents.44They have traditionally been used because they are thought to be lessTable 1 Primary tumour site in patients Lung 42 32 168 112 410 764 (37.5) Breast 11 20 70 141 101 343 (16.8) Lymphoma 11 e 75 92 56 234 (11.5) Gastrointestinal e 13 28 32 68 141 (6.9) Genitourinary e 13 57 51 70 191 (9.4) Other 14 5 26 88 15 148 (7.8) Unknown primary17 13 48 76 65 219 (10.7) Symptomatic?

The placement of large-bore tubes is perceived to be associated with signi cant discomfort45and this has led to the assessment of smaller bore tubes (10 e14 F) for drainage and administration of sclerosing agents.22 46 47Three randomised trials investigating the difference in ef cacy between small- and large-bore chest tubes all concluded that they were equivalent (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk).21e23Studies using small- bore intercostal tubes with commonly used sclerosants have reported similar success rates to large-bore tubes and appear to cause less discomfort.24e26 48The small-bore tubes in these studies were inserted either at the patient 's bedside by a physi- cian or under radiological guidance. Small-bore tubes have been used for ambulatory or outpatient pleurodesis. Patz and colleagues used a fluoroscopically-placed tube (10 F) connected to a closed gravity drainage bag system for this purpose.49Bleomycin was the preferred sclerosing agent and the pleurodesis success rate approached 80%. Ambulatory drainage is discussed further in the section on indwelling pleural catheters. Fluid drainage, pleurodesis and trapped lung <Large pleural effusions should be drained in a controlled fashion to reduce the risk of re-expansion pulmonary oedema. (C) <In patients where only partial pleural apposition can be achieved, chemical pleurodesis may still be attempted and may provide symptomatic relief. (B) <In symptomatic cases where pleural apposition cannot lung '), indwelling pleural cathe- ters offer a more attractive therapeutic approach than recurrent aspiration. ( U) <Once effusion drainage and lung re-expansion have been radiographically con rmed, pleurodesis should not be delayed. (B) <Suction to aid pleural drainage before and after pleurodesis is usually unnecessary but, if applied, a high-volume low-pressure system is recommended. (C) Large pleural effusions should be drained incrementally, draining a maximum of 1.5 l on the rst occasion. Any remaining fluid should be drained 1.5 l at a time at 2 h intervals, stopping if the patient develops chest discomfort, persistent cough or vasovagal symptoms. Re-expansion pulmonary oedema is a well-described serious but rare complication following rapid expansion of a collapsed lung through evacuation of large amounts of pleural fluid on a single occasion and the use of early and excessive pleural suction.5051Putative pathophysiological mechanisms include reperfusion injury of the underlying hypoxic lung, increased capillary permeability and local production of neutrophil chemotactic factors such as interleukin-8.52 53 The most important requirement for successful pleurodesis is satisfactory apposition of the radiologically.44 54 lung visceral peel ( 'trapped lung '), pleural loculations, proximal large airway obstruction or a persistent air leak. Most studies indicate that the lack of a response following instillation of a sclerosant is associated with incomplete lung expansion.56Where complete lung re-expansion or pleural apposition is not achieved, pleurodesis may still be attempted or an indwelling pleural catheter may be inserted. Robinson and colleagues reported a favourable response in 9 out of 10 patients with partial re-expansion of the lung in a study using doxy-cycline as a sclerosing agent.57The amount of trapped lung compatible with successful pleurodesis is unknown. Complete lack of pleural apposition will prevent pleurodesis: consideration of an indwelling pleural catheter is recommended in this situa- tion. Where more than half the visceral pleura and parietal pleura are apposed, pleurodesis may be attempted although there are no studies to support this recommendation. The amount of pleural fluid drained per day before the instillation of a sclerosant ( <150 ml/day) is less relevant for successful pleurodesis than radiographic con rmation of fluid evacuation and lung re-expansion. In a randomised study, a shorter period of intercostal tube drainage and hospital stay was seen in the group in whom sclerotherapy was undertaken as soon as complete lung re-expansion was documented (majority <24 h) than in the group in whom pleurodesis was attempted only when the fluid drainage was <150 ml/day. The success rate in both groups approached 80%.55After sclerosant instillation, the duration of intercostal drainage appears not to affect the chances of successful pleurodesis, although the only randomised study to address this question was underpowered.58 Suction may rarely be required for incomplete lung expansion and a persistent air leak. When suction is applied, the use of high-volume low-pressure systems is recommended with a gradual increment in pressure to about e20 cm H 2O. Analgesia and premedication <Lidocaine (3 mg/kg; maximum 250 mg) should be administered intrapleurally just prior to sclerosant administration. (B) <Premedication should be considered to alleviate anxiety and pain associated with pleurodesis. (C) Intrapleural administration of sclerosing agents may be painful; signicant pain is reported in 7% patients receiving talc to 60% with historical agents such as doxycycline.5759Discomfort can be reduced by administering local anaesthetic via the drain prior to pleurodesis. Lidocaine is the most frequently studied local anaes- thetic for intrapleural administration. The onset of action of lidocaine is almost immediate and it should therefore be admin- istered just before the sclerosant. The maximum dose of lidocaine is 3 mg/kg (21 ml of a 1% lidocaine solution for a 70 kg male), with a ceiling of 250 mg. The issue of safety has been highlighted in two studies. Wooten et al60showed that the mean peak serum concentration of lidocaine following 150 mg of intrapleural lido- caine was 1.3 mg/ml, well below the serum concentration associ- ated with central nervous system side effects (ie, >3mg/ml). In an earlier study of 20 patients, larger doses of lidocaine were neces- sary to achieve acceptable levels of local anaesthesia. The patients receiving 250 mg lidocaine had more frequent pain-free episodes than those given 200 mg, while serum levels remained within the therapeutic range. Side effects were limited to transient para- esthesiae in a single patient.61The reason for the signi cant difference in analgesia between the two groups with only a small increment in the lidocaine dose was unclear. There are no studies to inform a recommendation on the use of premedication and sedation in non-thoracoscopic pleurodesis. Pleurodesis is an uncomfortable procedure and is associated with anxiety for the patient. The use of sedation may be helpful to allay such fears and induce amnesia. The level of sedation should be appropriate to relieve anxiety but suf cient to maintain patient interaction. Sedation employed before pleurodesis should be conducted with continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry and in a setting where resuscitation equipment is available.62 Further research is underway to most effective sclerosant available for pleurodesis. (A) <Graded talc should always be used in preference to ungraded talc as it reduces the risk of arterial hypo- xaemia complicating talc pleurodesis. (B) <T alc pleurodesis is equally effective when administered as a slurry or by insuf flation. (B) <Bleomycin is an alternative sclerosant with a modest efcacy rate. (B) <Pleuritic chest pain and fever are the most common side effects of sclerosant administration. (B) An ideal sclerosing agent must possess several essential qualities: a high molecular weight and chemical polarity, low regional clearance, rapid systemic clearance, a steep dose-response curve and be well tolerated with minimal or no side effects. The choice of a sclerosing agent will be determined by the ef cacy or success rate of the agent, accessibility, safety, ease of administration, number of administrations to achieve a complete response and cost. Despite the evaluation of a wide variety of agents, to date no ideal sclerosing agent exists. Comparison of sclerosing agents is hampered by the lack of comparative randomised trials, different eligibility criteria and disparate criteria for measuring response and end points. A complete response is usually de ned as no reaccumulation of pleural fluid after pleurodesis until death, and a partial response as partial reaccumulation of fluid radiographically but not requiring further pleural intervention such as aspiration. However, some studies use a 30-day cut-off. A recent Cochrane review concluded that thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis is probably the optimal method for pleurodesis.63This view is supported by a systematic review.64Studies are presently underway investi- gating other agents including the pro brotic cytokine trans- forming growth factor b. Tetracycline Until recently, tetracycline had been the most popular and widely used sclerosing agent in the UK. Unfortunately, paren- teral tetracycline is no longer available for this indication in many countries as its production has ceased.65 Sterile talc T alc (Mg 3Si4O10(OH) 2) is a trilayered magnesium silicate sheet that is inert and was rst used as a sclerosing agent in 1935.66 T alc used for intrapleural administration is asbestos-free and sterilised effectively by dry heat exposure, ethylene oxide and gamma radiation. It may be administered in two ways: at thoracoscopy using an atomiser termed 'talc poudrage 'or via an intercostal tube in the form of a suspension termed 'talc slurry '. Success rates (complete and partial response) for talc slurry range from 81% to 100%.30 54 56 67 e70The majority of studies have used talc slurry alone and only a limited number of comparative studies have been published (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk). A truncated randomised study by Lynch and colleagues71 compared talc slurry (5 g) with bleomycin (60 000 units) and tetracycline (750 mg). Although the study was terminated early because of the removal of tetracycline from the US market, analysis of the data to that point revealed no differences between the three treatment groups 1 month after pleurodesis. In a randomised trial between talc slurry (5 g) and bleomycin (60 000 units), 90% of the talc group achieved a complete response at 2 weeks compared with 79% of the bleomycin group, which was statistically insigni cant.72Three studies havedirectly compared talc slurry with talc poudrage (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org. uk).73e75For one randomised study the data are available only in abstract form.73It suggests superiority of poudrage over slurry, but limited data are available to validate this conclusion. Of the other two studies, Stefani et al compared medical thoracoscopy and talc poudrage with talc slurry in a non-randomised way.75 Their results suggest superiority of poudrage over slurry, but the two groups were not equal with respect to performance status. In the largest study, Dresler et alcompared a surgical approach to talc poudrage with talc slurry.74They concluded equivalence, but 44% of patients dropped out of the study before the 30-day end point due to deaths and a requirement of 90% lung re- expansion radiologically after intervention to be included in the analysis. Three studies have compared talc poudrage with other agents administered via an intercostal tube. One compared bleomycin (see below) and the other two tetracyclines (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk).76e78 Diacon et al concluded that talc insuf flation at scopy was ef cacy and cost grounds.76Kuzdzal et al and Fentiman et al both showed an advantage of talc insuf flation over tetracyclines.77 78Each of the three studies analysed fewer than 40 patients. T alc slurry is usually well tolerated and pleuritic chest pain and mild fever are the most common side effects observed. A serious complication associated with the use of talc is adult respiratory distress syndrome or acute pneumonitis leading to acute respiratory failure. There have been many reports of pneumonitis associated with talc pleurodesis, although predominantly from the UK and the USA where historically non-graded talc has been used.56 79e87The mechanism of acute talc pneumonitis is unclear and has been reported with both talc poudrage and slurry.56 80This complication is related to the grade of talc used. Maskell and colleagues undertook two studies to determine this association. In the rst study they randomised 20 patients to pleurodesis using either mixed talc or tetracycline and compared DTPA clearance in the contralateral lung with that undergoing pleurodesis at 48 h after pleurodesis.88DTPA clearance half time decreased by more in the talc group, which is a marker of increased lung in flammation. There was also a greater arterial desaturation in those patients exposed to talc. In the second part of the study, graded (particle size >15mm) and non-graded (50% particle size <15mm) talc were compared. There was a greater alveolar earterial oxygen gradient in the group exposed to non-graded talc at 48 h after pleurodesis. In a subsequent cohort study of 558 patients who underwent thoracoscopic pleurodesis using graded talc, there were no episodes of pneumonitis.89 T wo studies have investigated the systemic distribution of talc particles in rats after talc pleurodesis. The earlier study using uncalibrated talc found widespread organ deposition of talc particles in the lungs, heart, brain, spleen and kidneys at 48 h. The later study used calibrated talc and found liver and spleen deposition (but no lung deposition) at 72 h, but no evidence of pleurodesis in the treated lungs.9091A further study in rabbits found greater systemic distribution of talc with 'normal '(small particle talc).92This supports the evidence from clinical studies that large particle talc is preferable to small particle talc. Bleomycin Bleomycin is the most widely used antineoplastic agent for the management of malignant pleural effusions. Its mechanism of action is predominantly as a chemical sclerosant similar bleomycin is absorbed systemically, it has been shown to cause minimal or no myelosuppression.93Bleomycin is an effective sclerosant with success rates after a single administration ranging from 58% to 85% with a mean of 61%. No studies have demonstrated superiority over talc.42 71 72 94 e102It has an acceptable side effect prole with fever, chest pain and cough the most common adverse effects.99 102The recommended dose is 60 000 units mixed in normal saline. Bleomycin has also been used in studies evaluating small-bore intercostal tubes placed under radiological guidance with similar ef cacy rates.46 48 49 103In the USA, bleomycin is a more expensive sclerosant than talc, but this is not the case in Europe where non-proprietary formulations are available.42 72 104 Rotation following pleurodesis <Patient rotation is not necessary after intrapleural instillation of sclerosant. (A) Rotation of the patient to achieve adequate distribution of the agent over the pleura has been described in many studies. However, rotating the patient is time consuming, inconvenient and uncomfortable. A study using radiolabelled tetracycline showed that tetracycline is dispersed throughout the pleural space within seconds and rotation of the patient did not in flu- ence distribution.105A subsequent randomised trial using tetracycline, minocycline and doxycycline revealed no signi cant difference in the success rate of the procedure or duration of fluid drainage between the rotation and non-rotation groups.106A similar study using talc showed no difference in distribution of talc after 1 min or 1 h and no difference in the success rate of pleurodesis at 1 month.107 Clamping and removal of intercostal tube <The intercostal tube should be clamped for 1 h after sclerosant administration. (C) <In the absence of excessive fluid drainage ( >250 ml/ day) the intercostal tube should be removed within 24 e48 h of sclerosant administration. (C) Clamping of the intercostal tube following intrapleural admin- istration of the sclerosant should be brief (1 h) to prevent the sclerosant from immediately draining back out of the pleural space, although there are no studies to prove that this is necessary.105Intercostal tube removal has been recommended when fluid drainage is <150 ml/day, but there is little evidence to support this action.58 68 108 109In the only randomised study that has addressed the issue, Goodman and Davies randomised patients to 24 h versus 72 h drainage following talc slurry pleurodesis regardless of volume of fluid drainage. They found no difference in pleurodesis success, although they did not reach the recruitment target based upon the power calculation. In the absence of any evidence that protracted drainage is bene cial, and given the discomfort associated with prolonged drainage, we recommend removal of the intercostal tube within 24 e48 h after the instillation of the sclerosant, provided the lung remains fully re-expanded and there is satisfactory evacuation of pleural fluid on the chest x-ray. Pleurodesis failure The most likely cause of pleurodesis failure is the presence of trapped lung. There is no reliable way to predict pleurodesis failure: a recent systematic review found that an arbitrary cut- off of pH <7.20 did not predict pleurodesis failure.15Where pleurodesis fails, there is no evidence available as to the most effective secondary procedure. We recommend that further evacuation of pleural fluid should be attempted with eithera repeat pleurodesis or insertion of indwelling pleural catheter, depending upon the presence of trapped lung. Surgical pleur- ectomy has been described as an alternative option for patients with mesothelioma (see later). Malignant seeding at intercostal tube or port site <Patients with proven or suspected mesothelioma should receive prophylactic radiotherapy to the site of thor- acoscopy, surgery or large-bore chest drain insertion, but there is little evidence to support this for pleural aspirations or pleural biopsy. (B) Local tumour recurrence or following pleural aspiration, pleural biopsy, intercostal insertion and thoracoscopy is in non-mesothelioma malignant effusions.110e113However, in mesothelioma up to 40% of patients may develop malignant seeding at the site of pleural procedures. Three randomised studies have addressed the efcacy of procedure site radiotherapy to prevent tract metas- tasis (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www. brit-thoracic.org.uk).114e116Boutin and colleagues114found that local metastases were prevented in patients who received radiotherapy (21 Gy in three fractions) to the site of thoraco- scopy. All the patients received radiotherapy within 2 weeks of thoracoscopy. The incidence of tract metastases in the control group in this study was 40%. This study was followed by a longitudinal study that supported its conclusions.117In two later studies including sites from a wider range of procedures such as needle biopsy and chest drain, the incidence of tract metastases was not signi cantly different. Bydder and colleagues showed no bene t of a single 10 Gy radiotherapy fraction to the intervention site in preventing recurrence.116All the patients received radiotherapy within 15 days of the procedure, but 46% of procedures were ne needle aspirations. O 'Rourke and colleagues used the same radiotherapy dose as Boutin but to smaller elds. They found no bene t of radiotherapy, but again included a range of procedures including needle biopsy. The study included 60 patients but only 16 thoracoscopies, 7 in the radiotherapy group and 9 in the best supportive care group. Tract metastases occurred in 4 patients in the best supportive care group (a rate of 44%) and none in the radiotherapy group.115This is very similar to the incidence of tract metastasis in the study by Boutin et al (40%). The other procedures were pleural biopsies (45%) and chest tubes (25%). A longitudinal study by Agarwal et al found the highest rate of pleural tract metastases in association with thoracoscopy (16%), thora- cotomy (24%) and chest tube (9%), but a much lower rate in association with pleural aspiration (3.6%) and image-guided biopsy (4.5%).118Careful analysis of the available data therefore supports the use of radiotherapy to reduce tract metastasis after signicant pleural instrumentation (thoracoscopy, surgery or large-bore chest drain), but not for less invasive procedures such as pleural biopsy or pleural aspiration. A larger study to specif- ically address this question would be of use. A cohort of 38 patients described by West et al reported an incidence of pleural tract metastasis after radiotherapy of 5%, but in these cases the metastasis occurred at the edge of the radiotherapy eld. Of six patients who received radiotherapy after an indwelling pleural catheter, one subsequently developed pleural tract metastasis.119There are, at present, insuf cient data on which to make a recommendation about the use of radiotherapy in the presence of indwelling pleural catheters. The role of prophylactic radiotherapy following pleural procedures in non-mesothelioma malignant effusions has not been established and therefore relief of distressing dyspnoea due to multiloculated malignant effusion resistant to simple drainage. (C) The use of brinolytic agents to ameliorate symptoms related to complex pleural effusions has been described in several studies although there are no randomised controlled trials. Davies et al found that intrapleural streptokinase increased pleural fluid drainage and led to radiographic improvement and amelioration of symptoms in 10 patients with multiloculated or septated malignant effusions. Intrapleural streptokinase was well tolerated and no allergic or haemorrhagic complications were reported.120Gilkeson et al121preferred urokinase in their prospective but non-randomised study. T wenty-two malignant pleural effusions were treated with urokinase resulting in a substantial increase in pleural fluid output in patients both with and without radiographic evidence of loculations. The majority then underwent pleurodesis with doxycycline resulting in a complete response rate of 56%. Similarly, no allergic or haemorrhagic complications were encountered. In the largest series, 48 patients un t for surgical release of trapped lung after incomplete lung re-expansion following tube drainage were given intrapleural urokinase.122Breathlessness was improved in 29 patients, 27 of whom eventually successfully achieved pleurodesis. This study compared cases with historical controls treated solely with saline flushes and in whom breathlessness was not assessed. None of these studies is large enough to accurately describe the safety pro le of brinolytic drugs in this setting. Immune- mediated or haemorrhagic complications have rarely been described with the administration of intrapleural brinolytics in contrast to systemic administration of these agents.123 124A chest physician should be involved in the care of all patients receiving this treatment. Thoracoscopy <In patients with good performance status, thoracoscopy is recommended for diagnosis of suspected malignant pleural effusion and for drainage and pleurodesis of a known malignant pleural effusion. (B) <Thoracoscopic talc poudrage should be considered for the control of recurrent malignant pleural effusion. (B) <Thoracoscopy is a safe procedure with low complica- tion rates. (B) Thoracoscopy (under sedation or general anaesthesia) has grown in popularity as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for malignant effusions. Under sedation, it is now widely used by respiratory physicians in the diagnosis and management of pleural effusions in patients with good performance status.125e128Patient selec- tion for thoracoscopy and talc poudrage is important in view of the invasive nature of the procedure and cost.129A signi cant benet of thoracoscopy is the ability to obtain a diagnosis, drain the effusion and perform a pleurodesis during the same procedure. The diagnostic yield and accuracy of thoracoscopy for malignant effusions is >90%.99 125 127 130 131T alc poudrage performed during thoracoscopy is an effective method for controlling malignant effusions with a pleurodesis success rate of 77e100%.6 68 97 132 e138Randomised studies have established the superiority of talc poudrage over both bleomycin and tetracyclines (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk).73 76e78One large randomised study comparing talc poudrage with talc slurry failed to establisha difference in ef cacy between the two techniques.74A further small non-randomised study comparing these two techniques also established equivalence.133A large study has established the safety of talc poudrage using large particle talc; no cases of respiratory failure were seen in this cohort of 558 patients.89T alc poudrage is known particularly to be effective in the presence of effusions due to carcinoma of the breast.139 Thoracoscopy has less to offer in patients with a known malignant pleural effusion and a clearly trapped lung on the chest x-ray. However, under general anaesthesia, rein flation of the lung under thoracoscopic vision will inform whether the lung is indeed trapped and therefore guide the decision to perform talc poudrage or insert a pleural catheter. The procedure can facilitate breaking up of loculations or blood clot in haemorrhagic malignant pleural effusion and can allow the release of adhesions and thereby aid lung re-expansion and apposition of the pleura for talc poudrage.140 141 Thoracoscopy is a safe and well-tolerated procedure with a low perioperative mortality rate ( <0.5%).6 126 129 142The most common major complications are empyema and acute respira- tory failure secondary to infection or re-expansion pulmonary oedema, although the latter may be avoided by staged evacua- tion of pleural fluid and allowing air to replace the fluid.127 129 143 Long-term ambulatory indwelling pleural catheter drainage <Ambulatory indwelling pleural catheters are effective in controlling recurrent and symptomatic malignant effu- sions in selected patents. (B) Insertion of a tunnelled pleural catheter is an alternative method for controlling recurrent and symptomatic malignant effusions including patients with trapped lung. Several catheters have been developed for this purpose and the published studies employing them have reported encouraging results.140 144 e147 The presence of foreign material (silastic catheter) within the pleural space stimulates an in flammatory reaction, and vacuum drainage bottles connected to the catheter every few days encourage re-expansion and obliteration of the pleural space. Most catheters can be removed after a relatively short period. In the only randomised and controlled study to date, Putnam and colleagues145compared a long-term indwelling pleural catheter with doxycycline pleurodesis via a standard intercostal tube. The length of hospitalisation for the indwelling catheter group was signi cantly shorter (1 day) than that of the doxy- cycline pleurodesis group (6 days). Spontaneous pleurodesis was achieved in 42 of the 91 patients in the indwelling catheter group. A late failure rate (de ned as reaccumulation of pleural fluid after initial successful control) of 13% was reported compared with 21% for the doxycycline pleurodesis group. There was a modest improvement in the quality of life and dyspnoea scores in both groups. The complication rate was higher (14%) in the indwelling catheter group and included local cellulitis (most common) and, rarely, tumour seeding of the catheter tract. The largest series to date reported on 250 patients, with at least partial symptom control achieved in 88.8%. Spontaneous pleurodesis occurred in 42.9% while catheters remained until death in 45.8%.148A more recent series of 231 patients treated with an indwelling catheter to drain pleural effusion reported a removal rate of 58% after spontaneous cessation of drainage, with only 3.8% reaccumulation and 2.2% infection.147This group included those with trapped lung (12.5% of all patients) or who had failed other therapy. A further series of 48 patients reported a spontaneous pleurodesis rate of 48%.149Pien et al studied a group of 11 patients in whom an effusion in the presence of trapped lung; 10 patients reported symptomatic improvement.144 A recent series of 45 patients reported by Janes et al described three cases of catheter tract metastasis associated with indwelling pleural catheters occurring between 3 weeks and 9 months after insertion. Metastases occurred in 2 of 15 patients with mesothelioma but in only 1 of 30 patients with other metastatic malignancy.150 An indwelling pleural catheter is therefore an effective option for controlling recurrent malignant effusions when length of hospitalisation is to be kept to a minimum (reduced life expec- tancy) or where patients are known or are suspected to have trapped lung and where expertise and facilities exist for out- patient management of these catheters. Although there is a signi cant cost associated with the disposable vacuum drainage bottles that connect to indwelling pleural catheters, there may be a cost reduction associated with reduced length of hospital stay or avoidance of hospital admission. Pleurectomy Pleurectomy has been described as a treatment for malignant pleural effusions. Open pleurectomy is an invasive procedure with signi cant morbidity. Complications may include empyema, haemorrhage and cardiorespiratory failure (operative mortality rates of 10 e19% have been described).151e153Pleur- ectomy performed by video-assisted thoracic surgery has been described in a small series of patients with mesothelioma. There is not suf cient evidence to recommend this as an alternative to pleurodesis or indwelling pleural catheter in recurrent effusions or trapped lung.154 Competing interests No member of the Guideline Group is aware of any competing interests.

The associated mortality and morbidity is high; in the UK 20% of patients with empyema die and approximately 20% require surgery to recover within 12 months of their infection.12Prompt evaluation and thera- peutic intervention appears to reduce morbidity and mortality as well as healthcare costs.3 This article presents the results of a peer- reviewed systematic literature review combined with expert opinion of the preferred management of pleural infection in adults for clinicians in the UK. The clinical guidelines generated from this process are presented in gure 1. The guidelines are aimed predominantly at physicians involved in adult general and respiratory medicine and speci - cally do not cover in detail the complex areas of tuberculous empyema, paediatric empyema or the surgical management of post-pneumonectomy space infection. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND BACTERIOLOGY OF PLEURAL INFECTION This section provides background information for reference, interest and to set the management guidelines in context. Historical perspective The Egyptian physician Imhotep initially described pleural infection around 3000 BC, although Hippocrates has been more famously credited with its recognition in 500 BC. Until the 19th century open thoracic drainage was the recommended treatment for this disorder but carried an associated mortality of up to 70%.45This high mortality was probably due to respiratory failure produced by the large open pneumothorax left by drainage.5This was particularly true of Streptococcus pyogenes infections which produce streptokinase and large alocular effusions free of adhesions.5Closed tube drainage was rst described in 1876 but was not widely adopted until the in fluenza epidemic of 1917e19. An Empyema Commission subsequently produced recommendations that remain the basis for treatment today. They advocated adequate pus drainage with a closed chest tube, avoidance of early open drainage, obliteration of the pleural space and proper nutritional support. These changes reduced mortality to 4.3% during the later stages of this epidemic. The introduction of antibiotics both reduced the incidence of empyema and changed its bacteri- ology. Before antibiotics, 60 e70% of cases were dueto Streptococcus pneumoniae which now only accounts for approximately 10% of culture-positive cases.6The prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus rose and the development of staphylococcal resis- tance in the 1950s increased complications and mortality.78More reported prevalence of anaerobic therapy was rst suggested in 194911but the impure agents available caused adverse reac- tions. Most recently, early use of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) techniques has been introduced.12 Epidemiology of pleural infection The overall incidence of pleural infection is increasing.313It is well recognised that pleural infection occurs most commonly in the paediatric and elderly populations and recent large-scale cohort studies concur with this nding. Farjah et al13studied 4424 patients with pleural infection and observed an increase in incidence of 2.8% per year (95% CI 2.2% to 3.4%). Similarly, in a study population of 11 294, between 1995 and 2003 Finley et al3found an increase in the pleural infec- tion incidence rate ratio (IRR) of 2.2 (95% CI 1.56 to 3.10) in patients aged <19 years and 1.23 (1.14e1.34) in those aged >19 years. Age-adjusted incidence rates also increased in their cohort by almost 13% during the 8-year period.3 Risk factors for pleural infection mirror those for pneumonia although independent considerations for developing empyema include diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression including corticosteroid use, gastro-oesophageal re flux, alcohol misuse and intravenous drug abuse.2A history of aspiration or poor oral hygiene is often elicited in anaerobic infection. Iatrogenic pleural infection following pleural interventions and thoracic or oesophageal surgery, trauma or oesophageal perforation account for the majority of remaining cases. Many patients have no apparent risk factors. Normal pleural fluid physiology In health, the volume of pleural flu i di nh u m a n si s small ( <1 ml), forming a lm about 10 mmt h i c k between the visceral and parietal pleural surfaces.14Pleural fluid contains protein at concentrations similar to the interstitial fluid, a small number of cells (predominantly mesothe- lial cells, macrophages and lymphocytes) and some large molecular weight proteins such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Compared with serum, pleural flu i di nh e a l t ha l s oc o n t a i n sg r e a t e rl e v e l s of bicarbonate, lower levels of sodium and similar1Oxford Centre for Respiratory Medicine, Churchill Hospital Site, Oxford Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK 2Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, UK Correspondence to Dr Christopher Davies, Department of Respiratory Medicine, Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading RG1 5AN, UK; chris.davies@royalberkshire. nhs.uk Received normal pleural fluid is around 7.6. These parameters change when disease processes affecting the adjacent lung or vascular tissue activate an immune response. Water and small molecules pass freely between mesothelial cells, while larger particles may be transported by cytoplasmic transport mechanisms or via pleurolymphatic communications. The pleurolymphatic communication is poorly understood, but probably consists of a series of stomata which connect selected areas of the parietal, mediastinal and diaphragmatic pleura, channels.14 Pathophysiology of pleural infection Pneumonia leads to about 110 000 emergency hospital admis- sions each year in the UK,16and the standardised incidence of hospitalisation is increasing (1.98 per 1000 in 2004 e5).16Up to 57% of patients with pneumonia may develop a pleural effu-sion17 18but, if appropriate antimicrobial therapy is instigated early, the fluid usually resolves. Most forms of pleural infection represent a progressive process that transforms a 'simple 'self- resolving parapneumonic pleural effusion into a brinopurulent collection associated with clinical and/or biochemical features of sepsis. This may signi cantly impair respiratory reserve and necessitate surgical drainage. Empyema is the presence of pus within the pleural space. The development of empyema in association with pneumonia is a progressive process and has been classi ed into three stages as: (1) a simple exudate, (2) a brinopurulent stage and (3) a later organising stage with scar tissue (pleural peel) formation.19 In the early exudative stage there is fluid movement into the pleural space due to increased capillary vascular permeability. This is accompanied by the production of proin flammatory cytokines such as interleukin 8 (IL-8) and tumour necrosis factor a(TNF a).2021These produce active changes in the pleuralFigure 1 Flow diagram describing the management fluid entry into the pleural cavity. Initially, the fluid is a free- flowing exudate characterised by a low white cell count, an LDH level less than half that in the serum, normal pH and glucose levels and does not contain bacterial organisms.17 22e26This stage, when the pleural fluid is a straightforward sterile exudate, is often called a 'simple para- pneumonic effusion '. Treatment with antibiotics at this stage is likely to be adequate and most effusions of this type do not require chest tube drainage.17 23 24 If appropriate treatment is not commenced, a simple para- pneumonic effusion may progress to the brinopurulent stage with increasing fluid accumulation and bacterial invasion across the damaged endothelium. Bacterial invasion accelerates the immune response, promoting further migration of neutrophils and activation of the coagulation cascade leading to increased procoagulant and depressed brinolytic activity.2021 27Increased levels and decreased type plasminogen activator (tPA) are seen which favour brin deposition and promote formation of septations within the fluid.20Neutrophil phagocytosis and bacterial death fuel the inflammatory process by the release of more bacteria cell wall- derived fragments and proteases.21This combination of events leads to increased lactic acid and carbon dioxide production resulting in a fall in pleural fluid pH,28accompanied by increased glucose metabolism and a rise in LDH levels due to leucocyte death. This leads to the characteristic biochemical features of abrinopurulent but not overtly purulent collection that pH <7.20, glucose <2.2 '.17Frank pus is termed 'empyema '. The nal stage is the organising phase in which broblasts proliferate.21A solid brous pleural peel begins to form which occasionally encases the lung preventing re-expansion, impairing lung function and creating a persistent pleural space with continuing potential for infection. Pleural infection may also develop without evidence of pneumonia dso-called 'primary empyema '. Bacteriology of pleural infection The microbiological features of pleural infection have altered signicantly in modern times, particularly since the introduction of antibiotic therapies in the 1940s. Pathogens isolated differ between patients with community or hospital-acquired pleural infection (table 1) and iatrogenic aetiology, for example, following thoracic surgery. Acknowl- edgement of the differing bacteriology should help to guide empirical antibiotic therapy. Community-acquired pleural infection In a recent large trial of 434 patients from over 40 centres in the UK with pleural infection, Gram-positive aerobic organisms were the most frequent organisms identi ed in community- acquired pleural infection.2Streptococcal species including the S milleri group of organisms and S aureus account for approxi- mately 65% of cases.292 coli and Haemophilus influenzaedare less commonly cultured and are seen more often in patients with comorbidity.45 The frequency of anaerobic isolates is rising and positive pleural fluid cultures in most series report anaerobes in 12e34%.192 93 33 5 e38 40 42However, when identi ed using different methods such as DNA ampli cation, anaerobes may be present in up to 76% of cases73 13 24 6and may be the only pathogen in about 14% of culture-positive cases.7 9 29 36 38Infections with anaerobes are more likely to have an insidious clinical onset,31with less fever, greater weight loss and are more common following possible aspiration pneumonia and with poor dental hygiene.31 Hospital-acquired pleural infection In patients with hospital-acquired infection, up to 50% of patients with positive pleural fluid cultures isolate S aureus.2 Meticillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) may account for up to two-thirds of cases,2although the prevalence of these infections may reduce as greater measures to reduce MRSA infection have been introduced in the last few years. Gram-negative organisms, most commonly E coli ,Enterobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp., are responsible for the majority of the remainder and signi - cantly higher rates of Gram-negative aerobes have been reported in patients who need admission to the intensive care unit.47 48 Polymicrobial infection is common with Gram-negative organisms and anaerobes which rarely occur in isolation and which is more frequent in elderly patients and those with comorbid disease.4749 Fungal empyema is rare ( are responsible for the majority51and are seen in immunosuppressed individuals. Mortality rates are high (up to 73%).51 The microbiological pro le of pleural infection also differs between countries and recognition of this, together with awareness of local antibiotic resistance patterns, is required to optimise treatment. In endemic areas such as Thailand pleural infection is reported in up to 22% of patients with pulmonary melioidosis (caused by the infection may arise following rupture of a liver collection and transdiaphragmatic spread.53 Despite a clinical picture of pleural infection with biochemical conrmation, pleural fluid culture is negative in approximately 40% of aspirates254and, although use of PCR may identify causative organisms more sensitively than conventional culturing methods, PCR is not yet a part of routine clinical practice in most UK centres.25 5Table 1 Bacteriology OPINION BEHIND THE GUIDELINE Respiratory specialist care <A chest physician or thoracic surgeon should be involved in the care of all patients requiring chest tube drainage for pleural infection. (C) In view of the substantial mortality associated with pleural infection, the small number of cases seen annually in a single centre and the need for prompt effective therapy, focusing the care of patients in specialist hands is appropriate. Delay to pleural drainage is probably associated with increased morbidity, duration of hospital stay,3033 36 56 e59and may lead to increased mortality.30Misdiagnosis, inappropriate antibiotics and chest tube malpositioning have been cited as important factors contributing to the inadequate management of pleural infection.56 An appropriately experienced physician requires the skills to identify patients for surgery and assess thoracic surgical risk, as well as expertise in managing the substantial comorbidities often present. A chest physician best combines these skills as well as having the advantage of an established liaison with thoracic surgical colleagues. In centres with thoracic surgery immediately available, care may be under a physician with a surgical opinion appropriate at any stage in a patient not settling with drainage and antibiotics. Nutrition <Clinicians should ensure adequate nutrition in patients with pleural infection. (C) Poor nutrition was identi ed during the First World War as an adverse determinant of outcome from pleural empyema but is frequently overlooked. Patients with pleural infection suffer catabolic consequences which may lead to further immuno- deciency and slow recovery. Hypoalbuminaemia is associated with a poor outcome from pleural infection1and clinicians should provide adequate nutritional support and consider supplemental enteral feeding (ie, nasogastric feeding) from the time of diagnosis. Thrombosis prophylaxis in pleural infection <All patients with pleural infection are at high risk for the development of venous thromboembolism and should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin unless contraindicated. (A) All acutely ill patients with pneumonia and/or pleural infection who have been admitted to hospital should receive prophylactic dose low molecular weight heparin treatment unless contra- indicated (eg, bleeding, thrombocytopenia, signi cant renal impairment, allergy to low molecular weight heparins).60e65In patients with renal impairment, unfractionated heparin should be used (5000 units subcutaneously twice daily). Mechanical prophylaxis and thromboembolic deterrent stockings should be used in those with contraindications to anticoagulant treatment. Identication: clinical <Features of ongoing sepsis and raised C reactive protein in patients with pneumonia after 3 days may indicate progression to pleural infection. (C) <All patients with suspected pleural infection should have blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria performed. (C) For patients in hospital with community-acquired pneumonia the median time to improvement in heart rate and blood pres- sure is 2 days, and 3 days for temperature, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation.66A failure to respond to initial managementmay indicate the presence of a parapneumonic effusion or empyema as a complication of pneumonia. Indicators of possible progression of pneumonia to pleural infection include ongoing fever and symptoms or signs of sepsisdfor example, elevated white cell count and/or in flam- matory markers such as C reactive protein (CRP). CRP is a sensitive marker of progress in pneumonia.6768Failure of the CRP level to fall by 50% is associated with an adverse outcome and increased incidence of empyema69and should prompt further evaluation including a repeat chest x-ray. A recent study70used a number of pneumonia severity scores and clinical variables to predict the likelihood of development of complicated parapneumonic effusion and empyema in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. None of the severity scores had any predictive value but seven clinical variables were identi ed predicting development of pleural infection. The presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associ- ated with reduced risk of progression to pleural infection, but the following variables were positively predictive: (5) intravenous drug abuse; and (6) chronic alcohol abuse. Using two or more points as the cut-off, the sensitivity was 87%, speci city 68.3%, positive predictive value 17.7% and negative predictive value 98.5%. The scoring system requires independent prospective validation. Blood cultures for bacteria are positive in about 14% of patients with pleural infection2and, when positive, are often the only source of positive microbiology. Blood cultures should therefore be performed in all patients with suspected pleural infection. Identication: imaging Initial imaging Empyema should be suspected in all patients who fail to respond to appropriate antibiotic therapy. A pleural effusion may be obvious on the chest x-ray71and the coexistence of pulmonary inltrates and fluid should alert the clinician to the possibility of a parapneumonic collection. Lateral chest x-rays may con rm pleural fluid not suspected on the posteroanterior chest x-ray,17 however pleural ultrasonography is widely available and is the preferred investigation. Ultrasound enables determination of the exact location of any fluid collection and guided diagnostic aspi- ration can be performed if required.71 72Increasingly, thoracic ultrasound is being performed alongside the chest x-ray in patients with suspected pleural infection. However, unlike chest radiography, ultrasound is not yet routinely available in out- patient settings and out of hours so, for monitoring/follow-up purposes, the chest x-ray remains the initial imaging investigation of choice. Pleural sepsis is occasionally caused by oesophageal rupture and this diagnosis should be suspected in patients who develop a pleural effusion soon after signi cant retching or vomiting. Diagnostic strategies to identify this important problem are oesophageal imaging (eg, a contrast-enhanced swallow assess- ment) and measurement of pleural fluid amylase levels which are raised as swallowed salivary amylase enters the pleural space through the oesophageal perforation.7374The detection of an oesophageal leak should prompt immediate referral to a surgeon with expertise in the management of oesophageal rupture. Further radiological assessment Ultrasound Pleural ultrasonography may help to identify pleural infection. In a study of 320 were due to either empyema or haemorrhage. Correlation between the presence of loculated pleural fluid and a signi cantly lower pleural fluid pH and glucose and a high LDH concentration has been shown,7677although this has not been corroborated by further studies. CT scanning Contrast-enhanced CT scanning with the scan performed in the tissue phase may be of value in patients when the diagnosis is in doubt or an underlying abnormality is thought either to be associated with the empyema or potentially its cause, such as an oesophageal perforation or bronchogenic carcinoma. CT scan- ning pleural empyema from a paren- chymal lung abscess and may also help to formulate management decisions about drainage, providing guidance for drain insertion and determination of subsequent tube posi- tioning and success of drainage attempts, and the need for surgical intervention. Empyemas are usually lenticular in shape and compress the lung parenchyma, while lung abscesses often have an indistinct boundary between the lung parenchyma and collection.7879The 'split pleura caused visceral pleural surfaces ( gure 2) and their separation in is characteristic of a pleural collection. Pleural thick- ening exudative parapneumonic effusions.80Pleural thickness on contrast enhanced CT scans is greater in those with frankly purulent effusions,83whereas the absence of pleural thickening suggests a simple parapneumonic collection.80Where pleural infection has in transudative effusions.81Moderate (<2 cm) mediastinal lymphadenopathy is seen in over one-third of patients with pleural infection.83 MRI MRI is not routinely indicated and offers no advantage over CT scanning for pleural infection; however, it may be considered inspeci c situations such as allergy to contrast agents or young/ pregnant patients where minimising ionising radiation exposure is a particular priority. MRI can also help to de ne chest wall involvement with the infection (eg, empyema necessitans or tuberculous with a pleural effusion in association with sepsis or a pneumonic illness require diagnostic pleural fluid sampling. (C) If a pleural effusion is identi ed on the chest x-ray of a patient with possible pleural infection, it is impossible clinically to differentiate the presence of a complicated parapneumonic effusion requiring chest tube drainage from a simple effusion that may resolve with antibiotics alone. There are also no speci c data relating to which patients with a parapneumonic effusion can be managed without diagnostic pleural fluid sampling. Sometimes patients seen initially in the community by their general practitioner will have spontaneous resolution of parapneumonic effusions in conjunction with antibiotics without any pleural sampling by the time they present to respiratory specialists. This cohort often present following referral to the outpatient setting with an undiagnosed pleural effusion and repeat imaging con rms radiological improvement. Although empyemas are more common in men than in women,193 35 78 4there are no differences in patient age, white cell count, peak temperature, presence of chest pain and extent of radiological in ltrate between patients requiring chest tube drainage for symptom resolution and those who resolve with antibiotics alone.17 Pleural fluid characteristics remain the most reliable diagnostic test to guide management,1722e24 77 85 e87and diagnostic pleural fluid sampling is therefore recommended in all patients with a pleural effusion >10 mm depth in association with a pneu- monic illness or recent chest trauma or surgery and who have features of ongoing sepsis. Imaging guidance should be used since this minimises risks of organ perforation88and improves the recovery rate of pleural fluid.89Sampling using thoracic ultrasound is simple, safer and will reduce patient discomfort (see guideline on pleural investi- gation).71 89 90Sampling can be performed by sterile procedure using a needle and syringe with local anaesthetic if necessary. Small effusions (ie, <10 mm thickness) will usually resolve with antibiotics alone.1725Observation may be appropriate for these patients, but an increase in the size of the effusion or ongoing sepsis should warrant re-evaluation and diagnostic pleural fluid sampling. Patients in an intensive care unit frequently develop pleural effusions that are not caused by pleural infection.91It is prob- ably safe to observe such patients with hypoalbuminaemia, heart failure or atelectasis who are at low risk of infection while treating the underlying condition.91Pleural fluid should be sampled if there are features of sepsis using ultrasound guidance, particularly in patients receiving positive pressure ventilation. <Pleural fluid pH should be assessed in all non-purulent effusions when pleural infection is suspected. (B) <If pleural fluid pH measurement is not available, pleural fluid glucose assessment should be performed where pleural infection is possible. (B) The presence of frank pus is diagnostic of an empyema and therefore, following aspiration, the appearance of the pleural fluid should be recorded. The pH of the pleural fluid of all non- purulent aspirates should be measured immediately. Protein Figure 2 Typical contrast-enhanced CT appearances of pleural empyema. The image pleural opacities. The 'split pleura' sign with enhancing visible on both the visceral and should be routinely requested on all initial samples. Pleural fluid cytology and acid/alcohol fast bacilli analysis for mycobacteria should be performed if clinically indicated. Further details are given in the BTS pleural investigation guideline. Pleural fluid from parapneumonic effusions or empyema is an in flammatory exudate and absolute pleural fluid protein values are of no value in determining the likelihood of spon- taneous resolution of the effusion or chest tube drainage requirements.1723 24 87Polymorphonuclear (PMN) leucocytes dominate, but the total pleural fluid leucocyte varies widely between simple effusions and empyemas.24A predomi- nance of lymphocytes in an exudate should raise the possibility of malignancy or tuberculosis. Pleural fluid for pH analysis should be collected anaerobically (as the presence of air can falsely elevate pleural fluid pH values92) in a heparinised blood gas syringe and then measured in a blood gas analyser. Physicians should be aware that lidocaine is acidic and can depress measured pH,92so a different syringe (devoid of residual lidocaine after local anaesthetic administra- tion) should be used for pleural fluid sampling.92 93It is not advisable and should not be necessary to put frank pus through a blood gas analyser as this already indicates a need for chest tube drainage of the effusion. However, where there is uncertainty about whether a turbid/cloudy fluid is infected, pH can be measured safely using a blood gas analyser. Extensive clinical experience of this technique, particularly in the USA, has shown it does not damage the blood gas analyser. Measurement of pleural fluid pH is unreliable when analysed by pH litmus paper or a pH meter, and these should not be considered an acceptable alternative to a blood gas analyser.94 95 A patient with pleural infection requiring drainage will develop a pleural fluid acidosis associated with a rising LDH level and a falling glucose level.1724 85Data from a systemic meta-analysis reviewing these criteria have justi ed their use.85 This report showed that a pleural fluid pH of <7.2 is also the single most powerful indicator to predict a need for chest tube drainage, and that pleural fluid LDH ( >1000 IU/l) and glucose (<3.4 mmol/l) did not improve diagnostic accuracy. Where pleural fluid pH measurement is not available glucose and LDH should be measured, a pleural fluid glucose level <3.4 mmol/l may be used as an alternative marker to indicate a need for chest drain insertion. However, pleural fluid glucose may be lowered in situations other than pleural infection, such as rheumatoid effusions, and this should be borne in mind when interpreting the result. Studies have shown that non-purulent collections with biochemical evidence of infection are likely to require chest tube drainage for adequate resolution of sepsis.1721 22 24 25 28 59 77 85 86 Occasionally a pleural fluid pH of >7.6 will be obtained in a complicated parapneumonic effusion as a result of infection with Proteus spp. Its ability to produce ammonia by urea split- ting can produce alkalotic fluid.96 If a single pleural fluid sample appears out of context with the clinical status of the patient and the ultrasound appearances, it may be of value to repeat the aspiration. A small series of multiple locule sampling showed that the biochemistry may be different in different locules.97 Pleural fluid cytokine a, vascular endothelial growth factor or CRP) may be useful to differentiate complicated parapneumonic effusions from other exudative collections.98e101Further studies are required to elicit their exact role.Indications for pleural fluid drainage in pleural infection <Patients with frankly purulent or turbid/cloudy pleural fluid on sampling should receive prompt pleural space chest tube drainage. (B) The presence of frankly purulent or turbid/cloudy fluid on pleural aspiration indicates the need for prompt chest tube drainage.1724 85 86Purulent fluid is more frequent in patients who fail chest tube drainage and require surgery or who die.57 <The presence of organisms identi ed by Gram stain and/or culture from a non-purulent pleural fluid sample indicates that pleural infection is established and should lead to prompt chest tube drainage. (B) The presence of organisms identi ed by positive Gram stain indicates bacterial invasion and implies progression from a simple effusion into a complicated parapneumonic effusion and hence the need for chest tube drainage.1724 86However, some frankly purulent or culture-positive parapneumonic effu- sions due to S pneumoniae may resolve with antibiotics alone, avoiding chest tube drainage.18 87Decisions regarding pleural drainage should be made on an individual basis. <Pleural fluid pH <7.2 in patients with suspected pleural infection indicates a need for chest tube drainage. (B) <Parapneumonic effusions that do not ful l any of these criteria for chest tube drainage could be treated with antibiotics alone provided clinical progress is good. (B) <Poor clinical progress during treatment with antibiotics aloneshouldlead to prompt patient review, repeat pleural fluid sampling and probably chest tube drainage. (B) Some patients with an initial pleural pH >7 . 2w i l lf a i lt o resolve their sepsis syndrome and will need chest tube drainage and even subsequent surgery.57These occasional cases con rm that, while pleural pH is adequately speci ci np r e d i c t i n gt h e need for pleural drainage, it is less than 100% sensitive57and does not accurately predict mortality or eventual need for surgical intervention.17 57One reason for this is the heteroge- neity of the biochemical characteristics in multiloculated effusions, such that sampling different infected locules can result in markedly different indices of disease severity.97 Unsatisfactory clinical progress therefore indicates a need for repeated pleural fluid sampling and possible chest tube drainage. <Patients with a loculated pleural collection should receive early chest tube drainage. (C) <Large non-purulent effusions could be drained by aspiration and/or chest tube if required for symptom- atic bene t. (C) When needle aspiration is straightforward, it may occasion- ally be possible to remove all the fluid at initial pleural fluid aspiration. In some cases the fluid will not re-accumulate and no further intervention will be required. The presence of loculation on chest radiography or ultraso- nography2477 102is associated with a poorer outcome and may be an additional indication for early chest tube drainage. Larger pleural collections ( >40% of the hemithorax) may be more likely to require surgery.1 102 Chest tube drainage <A small-bore catheter 10 e14 F will be adequate for most cases of pleural infection. However, there is no consensus on the size of the optimal chest tube for drainage. (C) <If a small-bore flexible catheter is used, regular flushing is recommended to avoid catheter be performed under imaging guidance wherever possible. (D) Chest tube insertion should be performed in line with the BTS pleural procedures guidelines103(see page ii61 ) and recent National Patient Safety Agency recommendations.88Image guidance should be used whenever available, particularly as many infected effusions will be loculated. The clinical outcome of patients with pleural infection treated with differing sized chest drains has not been addressed in a randomised controlled trial and there remains no clinical consensus on the optimal choice, with widely differing opinions between the medical and surgical specialities. Tradi- tionally, closed chest tube drainage of pus from the pleural cavity has been via large-bore ( >28 F) chest tubes inserted without radiological guidance. More recently, flexible small-bore catheters (10 e14 F) have been employed, which are easier and less traumatic to insert and may be more comfortable for the patient. In a large randomised trial assessing intrapleural brinolytic agents, subanalysis revealed no cacy with large-bore tubes compared with small-bore drains.84Previously published data suggest that image-guided small-bore catheters can have a good outcome, both as the initial drainage procedure104e108 and as a rescue treatment when larger tubes have failed.104e111 10e14 F catheters are popular in these series and have a low complication rate.71 105 107 111 112There is, however, still a substantial body of opinion, based on anecdotal clinical experience, which considers large-bore tubes to be more effective for draining thick pus. Sound clinical trials are needed to clarify the optimal chest tube size. No randomised controlled trial data exist evaluating optimal drain management issues such as flushing and drain suction. In most studies assessing small-bore catheters both flushing and suction were used,71104 105 107 108 111 113which may improve drainage ef ciency by reducing blockage of the catheter from brinous debris. Regular flushing (eg, 20 e30 ml saline every 6 h via a three-way tap) is therefore recommended for small cathe- ters, preferably administered by trained nurses. Flushing larger bore drains is technically more dif cult as these do not routinely have three-way taps and disconnection for irrigation might encourage introduction of secondary infection. Application of suction ( /C020 cm H 2O) is employed in the belief that it improves drainage, but there is no adequate trial evidence or clinical consensus on which to base speci c guidelines in this area.114 115 For further details on insertion of intercostal chest drains, readers are referred to the BTS pleural procedures guidelines103 and the section in this document on pleural procedures and thoracic ultrasound. Antibiotics <All patients should receive antibiotics targeted to treat the bacterial pro le of modern pleural infection and based on local antibiotic policies and resistance patterns. (B) <Antibiotics to cover anaerobic infection should be used in all patients except those with culture proven pneumococcal infection. (B) <Macrolide antibiotics are not indicated unless there is objective evidence for or a high clinical index of suspicion of 'atypical 'pathogens. (B) <Where possible, antibiotic choice should be guided by bacterial culture results and advice from a microbiolo- gist. (B)<Penicillins, penicillins combined with b-lactamase inhibitors, metronidazole and cephalosporins penetrate the pleural space well. Aminoglycosides should be avoided. (B) <When bacterial cultures are negative, antibiotics should cover both common community-acquired bacterial pathogens and anaerobic organisms. (B) <Empirical antibiotic treatment for hospital-acquired empyema should include treatment for MRSA and anaerobic bacteria. (B) <Intravenous antibiotics should be changed to oral therapy once there is clinical and objective evidence of improvement in sepsis. (D) <Intrapleural antibiotics are not recommended. (D) <Prolonged courses of antibiotics may be necessary and can often be administered as an outpatient after discharge. (D) As soon as pleural infection is identi ed, all patients should receive antibiotic therapy and, where possible, this should be chosen based on results of pleural fluid or blood culture and sensitivities. Most patients with pleural infection will have had antibiotics already. However, despite this, in a recent randomised trial 54% of patients with pleural infection had positive pleural fluid cultures and 12% positive blood culture results.84Those with positive blood cultures often had no other positive micro- biology results, emphasising the importance of taking blood cultures from all patients with suspected pleural infection.84 A signi cant proportion of both aerobes and organ- isms pleuropulmonary infection may demonstrate resis- tance to penicillin,7116 117butb-lactams remain the agents good penetration of the pleural space.34 121e124Aminoglycosides should be avoided as they have poor penetration into the pleural space and may be inactive in the presence of pleural fluid acidosis.34 125 e128There is no evidence that administering antibiotics directly into the pleural space offers any advantage. In the absence of positive culture results, empirical antibiotics should be chosen to cover likely pathogenic organisms. There are a considerable number of reasonable drug combinations and the chosen regimen should re flect whether the infection was community- or hospital-acquired, local hospital policies and antibiotic resistance patterns. In community-acquired infection, treatment with an amino- penicillin (eg, amoxicillin) will cover organisms such as S moniae and Hi n fluenzae ,129but a b-lactamase inhibitor such as co-amoxiclav or metronidazole should also be given because of the frequent co-existence of penicillin-resistant aerobes including S aureus and anaerobic bacteria.7 117 130A synergistic role of anaerobes with the S milleri group of organisms has been postulated.131 132 Clindamycin achieves good penetration of the infected pleural space126 133 134and offers adequate antimicrobial cover for these patients. Patients with a penicillin allergy can therefore be treated by clindamycin alone7 129or in combination with penicillins such as piperacillin also have anti-anaerobic activity and are alternative agents.116 136 Pleural effusions may occur in patients with Legionella monia but are usually self-resolving.137Although Legionella was not identi ed in a large recent as a cause of empyema138 and a macrolide antibiotic should be added in proven/suspected cases, although use of these antibiotics is not routinely recom- mended. Similarly, pleural effusions may occur in 5 e20% of patients with pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae .139 140 These are usually small reactive effusions which will resolve with suitable antibiotics, but diagnostic pleural fluid sampling may be needed to exclude a complicated parapneumonic effu- sion or empyema. In all cases, antibiotic regimens should be adjusted according to the subsequent culture results (while remembering that anaerobic pathogens are dif cult to grow and having a low threshold for anti-anaerobic coverage). In hospital-acquired empyema, usually secondary to nosoco- mial pneumonia, trauma or surgery, antibiotics should be chosen to treat both Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobes and anaerobic organisms (see table 1). Recent studies show that there is a signi cant increase in MRSA infection causing hospital-acquired pneumonia and empyema, so empirical anti- biotics for the latter should initially include cover for MRSA until microbiological results are available.2141e144 Intravenous administration of antibiotics is often appropriate initially but can be changed to the oral route when objective clinical and biochemical improvement is seen. The duration of treatment for pleural infection has not been assessed in detailed clinical trials, however antibiotics are often continued for at least 3 weeks, again based on clinical, biochemical (eg, CRP) and radiological response. Intrapleural brinolytics <There is no indication for the routine use of intrapleural brinolytics in patients for pleural infection. (A) Intrapleural brinolytic therapy was rst used in 1949.11More recently, observational series11 145 e169and small randomised trials149 170 e178showed these agents improved pleural fluid drainage, and it was therefore widely assumed they would improve long-term patient outcome. However, a recent large randomised trial showed that these short-term drainage bene ts are not associated with reduced mortality, the frequency of surgery, the length of hospital stay or long-term radiological and lung function outcome.84This trial used intrapleural streptokinase that was associated with an excess of immuno- logical adverse reactions such as fever, leucocytosis and malaise,148 156 165 179 180but no excess of systemic or intrapleural bleeding and no systemic activation of the brinolytic cascade,84in contrast to previous isolated reports of local pleural haemorrhage,156 163 168systemic bleeding153and epistaxis156 associated with its administration.151Thus, current evidence does not support the routine use of intrapleural brinolytic agents. On occasions, such treatment may be indicated for the physical decompression of multiloculated (and so tube drainage- resistant) pleural fluid collections that are responsible for dysp- noea or respiratory failure if discussion with a thoracic surgeon identi es that either surgery is not immediately possible due to additional patient co-morbidity, the feasibility of transfer to a surgical unit or other clinical or logistical reasons. Urokinase is non-antigenic but may still cause acute reactions (due to immediate hypersensitivity and histamine release) with fever150and cardiac arrhythmia.181There is a report of adult respiratory distress syndrome in a patient who received both streptokinase and urokinase for empyema drainage.182 Doses of brinolytics used in studies have varied but include streptokinase 250 000 IU daily11145 147 e149 151 e157 160 163 165 167 173 e176 179or 000 e4 h in the pleural space.There is currently interest in other intrapleural agents including combination therapy with brinolytics and fluid viscosity and bio lm-disrupting and deoxyribonuclease (DNase).183 184In experimental/trans- lational studies, this combination reduced infected pus viscosity when compared with brinolytics (streptokinase) alone and can disrupt infected bio lms.183e187Such therapeutic combinations are currently in human clinical trials. Preliminary results from one of these trials suggests that a combination of intrapleural tPA and DNase may provide superior drainage to a brinolytic alone, but full publication of these results is awaited. Timing of chest drain removal in pleural infection Removal of the chest drain is appropriate after radiological conrmation of successful pleural drainage dthat is, reduction in the size of the pleural collection on the chest x-ray or thoracic ultrasound dand objective evidence of sepsis resolution dthat is, improvement in temperature and clinical condition and decreasing in flammatory markers (eg, CRP). Inpatient observa- tion for 24 h after drain removal is usual, although a longer period of rehabilitation may be necessary as most patients will have been unwell and in hospital for a prolonged period. Persistent sepsis and pleural collection <Patients with persistent sepsis and a residual pleural collection should undergo further radiological imaging. (C) <Patients with persistent sepsis and a residual pleural collection should be discussed with a thoracic surgeon to consider all possible surgical options available. (D) In patients who do not respond to antibiotics and chest drainage with ongoing signs of sepsis in association with a persistent pleural collection, the diagnosis should be reviewed and a further chest x-ray and CT scan or thoracic ultrasound performed. Contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scanning more accurately iden- ties chest tube position, the anatomy of the effusion, presence of pleural thickening and may also identify endobronchial obstruction and mediastinal pathology.188e193Pleural thickening may represent development of a brinous 'peel may prevent lung re-expansion and hence pleural apposition regard- less of adequacy of fluid drainage.188 192 194 e196CT scanning cannot accurately differentiate early from late brinopurulent stage disease,82and pleural thickness on the CT scan does not appear to predict long-term outcome from tube drainage.57A pleural 'peel 'may resolve over several weeks and persisting with medical therapy over this period in stable patients may prevent the need for surgery.196Residual calci cation,82thickening of extrapleural tissues82and pleural scarring196may be seen on imaging long after resolution of an empyema. Patients with persistent sepsis <Patients should receive surgical treatment if they have persisting sepsis in association with a persistent pleural collection, despite chest tube drainage and antibiotics. (C) <Failure of chest tube drainage and antibiotics should prompt early discussion with a thoracic surgeon. (C) No objective criteria exist to de ne the point at which surgical intervention for control of pleural infection is required and the decision to operate on a patient remains subjective. Although previous observational studies have indicated that patients with purulent fluid57and/or loculations102at presentation are more likely to require surgery, many of these patients will settle without an operation and recent data indicate these features are not predictive.84 197Patients should be considered for surgery if they have ongoing signs of sepsis in association with a persistent ii48 Thorax 2010; 65(Suppl 2):ii41 eii53. doi:10.1136/thx.2010.137000BTS guidelinespleural collection despite drainage and antibiotics. Failure of sepsis to resolve within 5 e7 days39 198is suggested as an appropriate period following which a surgical opinion should be sought. Discussion with a thoracic surgeon should be considered in all cases failing to respond. VATS is increasingly used as rst-line therapy although open thoracic drainage or thoracotomy and decortication remain alternative techniques. The type of procedure performed will depend on many factors including patient age and comorbidity, surgeons 'preferences and local equipment availability. The choice of surgical procedure is beyond the remit of these guidelines and is not considered further. T wo small unblinded randomised trials have directly compared surgical and medical therapy. Wait et al12studied 20 patients with pleural infection who were suitable for general anaesthesia and randomised them to receive either immediate VATS or chest tube insertion (by junior resident medical staff) with additional instillation of intrapleural streptokinase for 3 days. The surgical group had higher primary treatment success (10/11 patients) and all streptokinase medical failures (5/9 patients) were salvaged by surgery without requiring thora- cotomy.12Surgical patients also had a shorter drainage period (5.8 vs 9.8 days) and hospital stay (8.7 vs 12.8 days). The results of this study are of doubtful robustness as the trial was very small, had an unusually high clinical failure rate in the control limb (55%) which explains the positive result, and was not blinded and so open to bias. Bilgin et al199randomised 70 patients with pleural infection to immediate VATS under local anaesthesia with sedation (n \u00bc29) or general anaesthesia if this was not tolerated (n \u00bc6) versus chest tube drainage (n \u00bc35). Both groups received antibiotic therapy. In the VATS group, initial treatment success was achieved in 82.8% (ie, no indication for subsequent open thoracotomy and decortication) compared with 62.9% in the tube drainage group. The mean hospital stay was 8.3 days for the VATS group and 12.8 days in the tube drainage arm (p<0.05).199Interpretation of the results, however, should be carefully considered as the authors did not clearly specify the primary outcome measure and the indications prompting further surgical intervention were highly subjective. Further appropriately powered and blinded trials are needed in this area. <The choice of antibiotic should be reviewed and a prolonged course administered where appropriate. (D) <A thoracic surgeon should be involved in assessment of suitability for anaesthesia. Less radical surgical inter- ventions including rib resection and placement of a large-bore drain may be considered in frail patients depending on surgical expertise and access and can be performed in some cases under local anaesthetic or with epidural anaesthesia. (C) <In patients with ineffective effusion drainage and persistent sepsis who are unable to tolerate general anaesthesia, re-imaging of the thorax and placement of a further image-guided small-bore catheter, a larger- bore chest tube or intrapleural brinolytic could be considered after discussion with a thoracic surgeon. (D) <For some patients, palliative treatment and active symptom control measures will be appropriate. (D) Ineffective chest tube drainage and persistent sepsis in patients un t for radical treatment can be approached by a number of 'less invasive 'options. Re-imaging the thorax and small-bore catheters may drain loculated collections105e109 111and larger bore chest tubes can be tried for 'thick 'pus.112Alternatively, patients mayproceed to surgical rib resection and open drainage under general or local anaesthesia; continued liaison with a thoracic surgeon should continue in achieving optimal management. The prolonged period (often months) of recovery following this procedure can contribute to increased patient morbidity and this must be discussed with patients during procedural consent. For some patients with empyema who are un t for radical treatment, further drainage may not be acceptable and, in these cases, ongoing sepsis and impaired respiratory function can lead to an unrelenting decline and subsequent death. When these patients are identi ed, palliative symptom control delivered by a multidisciplinary team may be appropriate. Bronchoscopy <Bronchoscopy should only be performed in patients where there is a high index of suspicion of bronchial obstruction. (C) The role of bronchoscopy in patients with empyema has not been addressed speci cally by any studies. In one series, 43/119 patients (36%) with empyema underwent bronchoscopy and tumour was found in only ve patients.1Bronchoscopy is usually performed at the time of surgery by most thoracic surgeons but, again, only a small number of these patients have obstructing tumour predisposing to their empyema.40Bronchoscopy is therefore only recommended where there is a high index of suspicion for bronchial obstruction dfor example, a mass or volume loss on radiographic imaging or a history of possible foreign body which may predispose to the pleural infection itself. Follow-up <All patients with empyema and pleural infection require outpatient follow-up. (D) Outpatient follow-up with a repeat chest x-ray and in flamma- tory markers should be arranged for all patients, often within 4 weeks following discharge, and continued outpatient care may be required for several months depending on progress. Persistent elevation of patients 'inflammatory markers should prompt further imaging and be interpreted in combination with their clinical status. Patients should be advised to return for prompt medical attention if recurrent symptoms develop since late relapse of pleural infection is well recognised. Prognosis in pleural infection The long-term survival of patients with pleural infection is good if prompt treatment is initiated. In a series of 85 patients followed for up to 4 years, the mortality was 14% and all deaths occurred within the rst 400 days after drainage.57Deaths were usually due to comorbid conditions and not directly due to sepsis from the empyema. No reliable clinical, radiological or pleural fluid characteristics accurately determine patients 'prognosis at initial presentation. Hypoalbuminaemia, the presence of loculated fluid and anaer- obic infections have been related to adverse outcome in previous studies176 77although not in recent reports.25 7 Long-term sequelae of pleural empyema may include residual pleural thickening (up to 13% of patients).200This is not usually associated with functional impairment although, rarely, extensive incapacitating pleural brosis may develop (brothorax).135 200 201Surgical decortication may occasionally provide symptomatic bene a brothorax.

In 1999, 11 centres across the UK offered a local anaesthetic thoracoscopy service, increasing to 17 centres in May 20041and 37 centres in 2009 (Dr N Downer, personal communication). This document, which will use the term 'local anaesthetic thoracoscopy ',a i m st o consider the following issues and to make appropriate recommendations on the basis of evidence where available: <The need for a local anaesthetic thoracoscopy service in the UK. <Evidence for use of local anaesthetic thoraco- scopy as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. <The conditions and patients in whom local anaesthetic thoracoscopy could be considered. <Levels of competence in local anaesthetic thor- acoscopy. <Practical aspects of performing the procedure. Creation of this guideline followed the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation/Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (AGREE/SIGN) methodology of evidence assessment and integra- tion (see introduction to pleural disease guidelines). THE NEED FOR A LOCAL ANAESTHETIC THORACOSCOPY SERVICE IN THE UK Is there a need for a physician-based local anaes- thetic thoracoscopy service in the UK ?The majority of local anaesthetic thoracoscopy is carried out in the context of an undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion, the commonest cause of which is malignancy.2This section of the document will therefore focus mainly on local anaesthetic thoracoscopy in the context of malignant disease. The increasing burden of pleural disease Malignant pleural effusion is a common clinical problem. Although the incidence of lung cancer in the UK is falling, the incidence of other cancers is rising. With increasing life expectancy in an ageing population and at current cancer incidence rates, an additional 100 000 cases of cancer per year are expected by 2025.3Up to 15% of patients who die with malignancy have a pleural effusion at autopsy.4Studies suggest that exudative effusions are caused by malignancy in a large number of cases (42e77%).5Cases of mesothelioma are due to increase until 2020.6The annual number of deaths from meso- thelioma continues to climb (from 153 deaths in 1968 to 1848 in 2001). The death rate is predicted to peak at around 2450 deaths per year in 10 years ' time.7It is predicted that 65 000 patients will die of mesothelioma between 2001 and 2050.7 There are no epidemiological studies of the inci- dence/prevalence of malignant pleural effusion in the UK. The annual incidence in the USA is esti- mated to be 250 000 cases58; extrapolating this, one might estimate there to be 50 000 new cases of malignant pleural effusion per year in the UK. This would translate to one new case per 1000 popula- tion per year. An average district general hospital serving a population of 250 000 might therefore expect to diagnose and treat approximately 250 new cases of malignant pleural effusion annually. Of these predicted 250 cases, only 60% will be diagnosed by pleural aspiration (see later) and only 60e80% will achieve a successful rst pleurodesis via an intercostal drain. In both of these instances, patients may bene t from local anaesthetic thor- acoscopy. An improved service for patients with malignant pleural disease, either from primary pleural carcinoma or from metastases from other organ sites, is therefore required. <Malignant pleural effusion represents an increasing burden of disease both to patients and to healthcare resources. (D) EVIDENCE FOR THE USE OF LOCAL ANAESTHETIC THORACOSCOPY Diagnostic yield of local anaesthetic thoracoscopy in the investigation of suspected pleural malignancy A signi cant number of cases of are undiagnosed after simple diagnostic pleural aspira- tion.2Pooled data from a total of 1370 patients suggests that a positive cytological diagnosis of malignancy may be obtained from a single diagnostic pleural aspiration in 60% of cases.2 A second sample modestly increases the diagnostic yield (by around 15%) but a third sample is non- contributory.2Pleural fluid cytology has an even poorer diagnostic yield in mesothelioma, in which a positive result is obtained in only 32% of cases.9 Traditionally, 'blind 'pleural pleural biopsy or Abrams needle biopsy) has been the next step in investigating cytology negative exudative<A supplementary appendix is published online only.

This procedure is relatively cheap and readily accessible and is still used in many institu- tions. However, there is increasing evidence that 'blind 'pleural biopsy is less sensitive in the diagnosis of malignant pleural disease than CT-guided pleural biopsy or local anaesthetic thoracoscopy. This is understandable when one considers that direct visualisation of the pleura in malignancy often reveals patchy abnormalities with disease affecting the more dependent part of the pleura near the diaphragmatic surface. In malignant effusion, use of 'blind 'pleural biopsy increases the diagnostic yield pleural fluid 7 e27%.2For 'blind 'pleural biopsy to fluid cytology increases the diagnostic yield in total to 50%.10Alternative diagnostic strategies have therefore been investigated, including ultrasound and CT-guided pleural biopsy. In a randomised controlled trial comparing diagnostic rates in CT-guided versus 'blind 'pleural biopsy for suspected malignancy, 'blind had a sensitivity of 47% compared with 87% for CT- guided biopsy.11This translates to one pleural biopsy being avoided for every 2.5 CT-guided biopsies undertaken. Contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scanning is the next mended choice in cytology negative pleural effusion.2Areas of pleural thickening or nodularity may be identi ed and subsequently biopsied under image guidance with a good diagnostic yield.11However, abnormal pleural appear- ances are not always seen on thoracic CT scans and biopsies are sometimes negative. Where a diagnosis is obtained, further intervention is usually required to treat and control the effusion (see below). Furthermore, although thoracic CT scanning followed by image-guided biopsy is effective in diagnosis, radi- ology departments in many hospitals are overstretched and there is variable access to this service. Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy allows direct visual assess- ment of the pleura and subsequent biopsy of visually abnormal areas, hence maximising diagnostic yield. A total of 22 case series have reported diagnostic yield of local anaesthetic thoracoscopy for malignant disease.12e33Pooling results from all these studies, thoracoscopy has a 92.6% diagnostic sensitivity for malignant pleural disease (1268/1369, 95% CI 91.1% to 94.0%). Pooling results from only those eight studies in which a prior 'blind ' pleural biopsy was negative,12 15e17 24 25 31 sensitivity of 90.1% (334/337, 95% CI 86.6% to 92.9%). Several large case series have reported high diagnostic sensi- tivity and speci city in the diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)3435 (see Harris et al35for review of case series before 1995). While there are no studies directly comparing medical with surgical (VATS) thoracoscopy, the above evidence suggests that local anaesthetic thoracoscopy has a similarly high diagnostic rate in malignant pleural effusion. Examining the largest of these case series in more detail, Hansen et al14retrospectively examined the diagnostic yield of local anaesthetic thoracoscopy in 147 patients, 136 of whom had pleural effusion which was cytology and microbiology negative on three samples. The overall diag- nostic sensitivity was 90.4% with a sensitivity of 88% and a speci city of 96% for malignant disease. Menzies et al15 prospectively evaluated local anaesthetic thoracoscopy in 102 patients, 86 of whom had effusion after tivity for diagnosis of malignancy was 96%, a gure comparable with that quoted for CT-guided biopsy (87% sensitivity).11In a retrospective series of 149 cases, Blanc et al12showed that in 66 cases of 'inflammation 'diagnosed at blind pleural biopsy, 32(48%) were re-diagnosed at thoracoscopy (including 16 cases of malignant mesothelioma, 13 cases of carcinoma and 3 cases of tuberculosis).15 The diagnostic yield of local anaesthetic thoracoscopy in case series of malignant mesothelioma appears to be equally good. In a retrospective case series of 188 patients with malignant mesothelioma, the sensitivity of thoracoscopic biopsies is reported as >90%.13This high diagnostic rate of local anaes- thetic thoracoscopy in malignant mesothelioma is of particular importance, given the even lower diagnostic yield from pleural fluid cytology and blind pleural biopsy in this disease and the importance of avoiding multiple pleural procedures.36 The 'semi-rigid 'orflexible thoracoscope is a relatively new innovation in the eld of pleural disease. Four studies accurately report the diagnostic rate for malignancy,1621 23 24which combined give a diagnostic sensitivity for malignant pleural disease of 96/113 (85.0%, 95% CI 78.4% to 91.5%). With increasing pressure on services to rapidly achieve diag- nosis and treatment in patients with possible malignancy, local anaesthetic thoracoscopy offers a high diagnostic yield for malignancy and a therapeutic procedure in the same sitting (see below). Blind pleural biopsy after initial negative cytology is a cheap and readily available technique, but it is associated with a substantially lower diagnostic yield and its use may lead to delay in diagnosis and treatment. Where the option exists to access techniques with a higher diagnostic yield earlier in the patient journey, these may help to decrease the time taken to achieve diagnosis and treatment. <The currently available data support local anaesthetic thoracoscopy as one of the techniques with the highest diagnostic yield in aspiration cytology negative exuda- tive anaesthetic thoracoscopy in this regard appears to be as high as for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). (D) Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy as a therapeutic procedure When a diagnosis of malignancy is made using pleural fluid cytology, blind pleural of symptomatic pleural effusion usually requires further intervention. This most commonly takes the form of either chest drain insertion and subsequent 'medical 'pleurodesis37or referral for a VATS pleurodesis. 'Medical 'pleurodesis via a chest drain using various agents succeeds in approximately 60% of patients,37with the remainder requiring further intervention, often necessitating further hospital admissions or a surgical referral. This represents an extra burden to both the patient and the healthcare service in terms of waiting time, days spent in hospital and invasive procedures. Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy offers diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a single sitting, which is of particular relevance to mesothelioma where mini- mising thoracic procedures may be important with the associ- ated risk of biopsy tract invasion and the possible need for biopsy site radiotherapy.36 38e40 Pleurodesis by talc insuf taken during local anaesthetic thoracoscopy if the pleura appears abnormal on direct inspection. Eleven studies have assessed the efcacy of talc poudrage by local anaesthetic thoracoscopy in patients with malignant pleural effusion only41e51(a further six studies12 18 28 52 e54included patients with malignant and benign causes of pleural effusion), including two randomised controlled trials. Interpretation of the ef cacy rate of talc poudrage is complicated by the considerable heterogeneity in how each of these studies assessed 'success 'rate. ef cacy of talc poudrage at 1 month in patients with malignant disease only (radiological outcome) is around 84% (645/765, 95% CI 81.7% to 86.9%). If studies including both benign and malignant causes of effusion are included, the radiological success rate at 1 month of talc poudrage pleurodesis is unchanged at 85% (839/982, 95% CI 83.2% 87.6%). However, analysing combined data from the two randomised trials only suggests a lower success rate than this at 1 month (158/237, 67%). Direct comparison of talc slurry pleurodesis with talc poudrage for malignant pleural effusion has been the subject of a Cochrane review. The RR of non-recurrence of pleural effusion was calculated as 1.19 in favour of talc poudrage via thoraco- scopy, increasing to 1.68 when a variety of other scelorosants were used. However, the largest randomised study by Dresler et al43in 482 patients was published after this Cochrane review and showed equal success rates for poudrage and slurry pleu- rodesis (60% for poudrage vs 52% for slurry, p \u00bc0.1). Subgroup analysis of those patients without trapped lung (ie, where pleurodesis was technically achievable) suggested a slight bene t of talc poudrage (82% poudrage vs 71% slurry, p \u00bc0.045) with further bene t in patients with lung or breast carcinoma (82% poudrage vs. 67% slurry). T aken together, the current evidence suggests that talc poudrage is a highly effective method of pleurodesis which is at least equivalent to talc slurry with possibly increased ef cacy in certain disease subgroups. Further targeted studies in these subgroups are needed. The optimal length of hospital stay after local anaesthetic thoracoscopy poudrage is unknown. The mean length of stay of patients after the procedure across eight case series of local anaesthetic thoracoscopy in a total of 361 patients was <Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy provides a high diag- nostic yield and effective therapeutic pleurodesis in a single procedure. (C) Safety of local anaesthetic thoracoscopy Many patients with undiagnosed pleural effusion are unsuitable for surgical diagnostic and therapeutic strategies such as VATS procedures due to comorbidity, limited survival and inability to tolerate general anaesthetic. Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy under intravenous sedation offers these patients a reasonably high likelihood of diagnosis and pleurodesis in a single procedure that is well tolerated. Overall, local anaesthetic thoracoscopy is a safe procedure. Combining data from 47 studies in which complications from local anaesthetic thoracoscopy were 0.19% to 0.54%). Of these studies, 28 of diagnostic thora- coscopy alone13e17 19 22 e26 29e31 55 56 58 e60 62e66 68 69 72 73 in which the combined mortality was 0/2421 (0%, 95% CI 0% to 0.15%). The 19 studies involving talc poudrage12 28 42e45 47e54 57 61 67 70 71gave a mortality of 16/2315 (0.69%, 95% CI 0.40% to 1.12%). A major contribution to this mortality (9 deaths out of 16) was from a large randomised study of talc poudrage conducted in the USA using non- graded talc.43 Major postoperative pneumo- thorax or air leak and pneumonia) were reported in the same 47 studies and occurred in 86/4736 cases (1.8%, 95% CI 1.4% to 2.2%). Where minor (subcutaneous emphysema, minor haemorrhage, operative skin site infection, hypotension during procedure, raised temperature, atrial brillation) werereported (31 studies12e1719 23 42 44 47 e60 68 73), these occurred in 177/2411 procedures (7.3%, 95% CI 6.3% to 8.4%). The complication rate of talc poudrage is probably related to both the dose and type (graded versus non-graded74) of talc used (see the practical procedure guide in the online appendix). In a large randomised trial of talc poudrage for pleural effusion,439/222 poudrage (4.1%) and 7/240 patients (2.9%) died from presumed talc-associated respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ( c2test, 1df\u00bc0.3, p\u00bc0.61). All these cases were treated with non-graded (USA) talc. A recent large multicentre cohort study using exclusively graded talc found no instances of ARDS or death related to talc poudrage at local anaesthetic thoracoscopy in 558 patients.75 <Local is a safe procedure. (D) <Where talc poudrage is to be conducted, graded talc should be used. (C) Use in other conditions Tuberculosis 'Blind 'pleural biopsy is a robust diagnostic tool in suspected tuberculosis (TB) pleuritis as this condition affects the pleura diffusely and is cheap and widely available. High diagnostic sensitivity has been reported in areas of high TB prevalence.76 'Blind 'pleural biopsy is therefore a good of diag- nostic strategy in suspected TB pleuritis, particularly in areas of high TB prevalence. As a diagnostic tool, local anaesthetic thoracoscopy has a higher diagnostic yield than for TB pleuritis. Six studies2526 local anaesthetic thoracoscopy for TB pleuritis including one direct comparison with 'blind '(Abrams) biopsy76 (see below). Five of these studies were conducted in areas of low prevalence for TB,25 26 29 e31with the other76conducted in South Africa. Pooling the results of the ve low prevalence area studies,25 26 29 e31local anaesthetic thoracoscopy had a diag- nostic yield of In the prospective trial comparing local anaesthetic thoracoscopy with Abrams biopsy in an area with a high TB prevalence,76thoracoscopy was found to have a combined culture/histology sensitivity of 100% compared with 79% for 'blind 'pleural biopsy. Therefore, the technique with the highest diagnostic rate for TB pleuritis on the basis of published evidence is local anaesthetic thoracoscopy. However, since blind pleural biopsy has high sensitivity and is likely to be more cost-effective as an initial diagnostic procedure, it will often be the procedure of rst choice, depending on service availability, operator skill, workload, the pretest probability of TB and the prevalence within the population. If 'blind 'pleural biopsy is unsuccessful in suspected TB pleuritis, thoracoscopy recommended as the next diagnostic step. <Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy has a high yield for TB pleuritis and a greater yield than blind pleural biopsy in high prevalence TB areas. is non-diagnostic, local anaes- thetic thoracoscopy next diagnostic step. (D) Empyema Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy may be useful for the treatment of pleural infection, allowing division of septations and adhesions and facilitating accurate tube placement and drainage. It has been used in Europe as a primary treatment strategy for treating empyema. Three studies are reported in the literature on infection.5359 68All of these are non-comparator case series (one prospective) and in combination show a high 'success rate 'of treatment (131/143, 91.6%) and no complications (Grade D). However, local anaesthetic thoracoscopy is not currently used in the UK either as primary or rescue therapy for pleural infec- tion. Thoracic surgical intervention is the current treatment of choice for patients not responding to initial medical therapy (see guidelines on pleural infection). Large prospective randomised comparator trials are needed to elucidate the exact role of local anaesthetic thoracoscopy in this context. The limited evidence above is unlikely to change current UK practice, although it may be a technique which is used in the future with collaboration between a medical thoracoscopist and a thoracic surgeon. Pneumothorax In Europe, talc poudrage at local anaesthetic thoracoscopy is a common treatment for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Denitive treatment for pneumothorax is not usually considered in the UK after the rst episode of pneumothorax, except in speci c circumstances such as occupational reasons or bilateral pneumothoraces (see guideline on pneumothorax). One case series from Europe reported good long-term results from talc poudrage pleurodesis using 'medical 'thoracoscopy (performed under general anaesthetic) in patients with a persistent air leak (>7 days) or recurrent pneumothorax, demonstrating a 93% success rate (lack of further ipsilateral pneumothorax) over a mean of 5 years of follow-up.70One randomised study compared talc poudrage pleurodesis with intercostal tube drainage as initial therapy for primary spontaneous pneumo- thorax, demonstrating superiority of talc poudrage (recurrence rate 3/59, 5.1%) over the intercostal tube (recurrence rate 16/47, 34%).71T alc poudrage pleurodesis there- fore appears to be an effective treatment for patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax. However, in the UK, surgical management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax is considered the de nitive treatment strategy and is associated with low operative mortality and excellent results. Additional procedures of blebectomy, pleurectomy and abrasion pleurodesis are usually possible only under single lung ventilation and are normally conducted under general anaesthesia, within the remit of thoracic surgery only. Physician-led thoracoscopy may develop in the future as a treatment strategy for these patients, but further evidence de ning its role compared with the gold standard of surgical management is required. In addition, talc pleurodesis is likely to be very painful in patients with normal parietal pleural surfaces (such as those with primary pneumo- thorax) and therefore deep sedation or general anaesthesia may be required for this treatment. Secondary pneumothorax in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) heralds increased mortality and often requires prolonged hospital admission.77These patients are often poor surgical candidates because of poor lung function and are at high risk from general anaesthesia; there is no evidence base on which to determine treatment in this very dif cult group. T alc slurry via a chest drain is often advocated, but such patients may also be treated by local anaesthetic thoracoscopy. There is a single series78(n\u00bc41) assessing talc poudrage pleurodesis in pneumothorax (FEV 1) 41% predicted), demon- strating a 95% success rate for pleurodesis after an average follow-up of 3 years. Four patients (9.8%) died within 30 days of the procedure and seven (17%) experienced ongoing air leak for >7 days.<Talc poudrage pleurodesis may be an effective treat- ment for both primary and secondary pneumothorax (D). However, the current de nitive treatment strategy for these patients is thoracic surgery (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or mini-thoracotomy with pleural abrasion pleurodesis with or without lung resection). <If surgery is deemed unsuitable because of the associ- ated signi cant risks in some patients with secondary pneumothorax, local anaesthetic thoracoscopy may be considered if undertaken by experienced practitioners. Other indications Lung biopsy Medical thoracoscopic 'pinch 'lung biopsy is practised in some parts of Europe to aid diagnosis in the case of diffuse interstitial lung disease or diffuse shadowing in immunocompromised patients. There are three case series6266 72(one prospective72) reporting the results of such 'pinch 'lung biopsies undertaken during local anaesthetic thoracoscopy. A total of 148 patients were studied across these three studies, 87 with interstitial lung disease and the remainder were immunocompromised. No deaths were reported, with a procedure-associated major complication rate of 5/148 (3%). Overall, the 'diagnostic rate 'in these studies (which was taken in each study to mean a result from the lung biopsy which changed patient management) was high (135/148, 91%) (grade D). In view of current UK practice of the diagnosis and manage- ment of interstitial lung disease and of diffuse parenchymal shadowing in immunocompromised patients, local anaesthetic thoracoscopy cannot currently be recommended for these indi- cations in the UK. Lung biopsy for the diagnosis of such parenchymal lung disease is currently undertaken using thoracic surgical techniques where appropriate, if bronchoscopic trans- bronchial biopsy is negative or considered inappropriate. Changes in diagnostic algorithms for diffuse interstitial lung disease in the future may make local anaesthetic thoracoscopy a useful and more widespread procedure, but would be con ned to higher level physician operators. Similarly, thoracoscopic sympathectomy is performed in Europe but not in the UK by physician thoracoscopists. However, changes in work and referral patterns in the future may make this a potential application in the UK. These tech- niques would again be con ned to operators with substantial experience (see section on operator levels below). INDICATIONS FOR LOCAL ANAESTHETIC THORACOSCOPY This section of the guideline addresses clinical considerations for patients who are suitable for or may be referred for a local anaesthetic thoracoscopy. This part of the document has been drafted on the basis of expert opinion from physician local anaesthetic thoracoscopists from the UK. General Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy should generally only be under- taken in patients with a radiologically con rmed pleural effusion (although advanced operators may induce pneumothorax). It should usually only be undertaken in patients with good performance status (WHO status 0, 1 or 2). However, any dyspnoea secondary to the effusion will be relieved by the procedure, so breathlessness alone is not necessarily a contrain- dication. Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy should generally be undertaken in those in whom survival is expected to be reasonable; it is not appropriate in terminally 65(Suppl 2):ii54 eii60. including local anaesthetic thoracoscopy, should only be performed in patients in whom a tissue diagnosis will affect management. Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy should be reserved for those patients in whom the diagnostic/therapeutic bene t is judged to be worth the burden of an invasive procedure and subsequent hospital stay. In prac- tical terms, the performance status of the patient and the predicted prognosis are likely to dictate this. It is expected that the majority of patients undergoing local anaesthetic thoracoscopy will have had a thoracic CT scan rst. The provision of 'on table 'thoracic ultrasound prior to local anaesthetic thoracoscopy is not a requirement to perform the procedure. However, it is likely to increase safety, prevent inac- curate port site entry and decrease the number of 'complicated ' thoracoscopies (eg, if a heavily septated effusion is seen, only a higher level operator would proceed). In two case series totalling 707 patients,2273the routine use of preprocedure ultrasound resulted in only one (0.1%) inaccurate entry site. Preprocedure thoracic ultrasound scanning should therefore be used where possible and where there are adequately trained staff to perform the scan. Fitness for procedure Patients should be t enough to undergo the procedure. The majority of patients will gain symptomatic relief from pleural effusion drainage undertaken during thoracoscopy. Dyspnoea due to pleural effusion alone is therefore not a contraindication to the procedure per se. The procedure involves intravenous sedation and therefore a reasonable level of oxygen saturation ( >90% with additional oxygen during the procedure) is required. A single small study has assessed respiratory gas changes during local anaesthetic thoracoscopy60using intravenous hydrocodone and boluses of pethidine and midazolam in patients who were given oxygen during the procedure. This study demonstrated minor changes only in carbon dioxide and oxygen tensions (P CO2and P O2) during the procedure (mean 6SD change in P CO21.7660.71 kPa; mean6SD change in P O20.6160.43 kPa). Patients must be able to tolerate lying flat/on their side for the duration of the procedure. Substantial dyspnoea on lying flat/in the lateral decubitus position is not per se a contraindication to thoracoscopy as drainage of fluid at the beginning of the procedure is likely to alleviate this. Where concerns exist about sedating very dyspnoeic patients, particularly if two drugs are to be used, clinicians may wish to seek anaesthetic advice. Consent Written informed consent is mandatory where the patient is competent and should only be obtained by a member of staff trained in the procedure or adequately trained to take consent according to General Medical Council guidelines. Written infor- mation should be provided before the consent process. Absolute contraindications The following are absolute contraindications: <Lung adherent to the chest wall throughout the hemithorax. <Hypercapnia or severe respiratory distress. <Uncontrollable cough (making safe entry and movement of thoracoscopes within the chest hazardous). <Lack of informed consent in a competent patient. Relative contraindications The following are relative contraindications:<Very severe obesity may make the procedure technically more difcult and may prevent entry into the thoracic cavity due to inadequate cannula length. <As in the British Thoracic Society bronchoscopy guidelines, any reversible condition (eg, infection, airways disease) should be fully treated before the procedure. Caution will be required in patients with certain signi cant comorbid conditions (eg, ischaemic heart disease, recent myocardial infarction (for which the procedure should be delayed by at least 4 weeks after the initial event), clotting dysfunction, renal failure and immunocompromise), and such conditions should be addressed prior to the procedure just as they are prior to bronchoscopy.33 <A high likelihood of trapped lung is a contraindication to therapeutic thoracoscopy as this suggests a successful pleuro- desis is very unlikely. <The known presence of an obstructing central airway tumour is a contraindication as, in such instances, bronchoscopy with or without intervention is the investigation/treatment of choice. Place of local anaesthetic thoracoscopy in the diagnostic pathway The published BTS guideline on the investigation of unilateral pleural effusion provides a scheme for the order of diagnostic strategies to be used.2In patients with an exudative pleural effusion where a single (and in some cases second79) diagnostic pleural aspiration is negative, the size of the effusion will guide further investigation. In those in whom an effusion of more than one-third of the hemithorax is present, a CTscan should be obtained. This should guide the selection of the next investiga- tion step which is likely to be either CT-guided biopsy or thor- acoscopy, either local anaesthetic or surgical (VATS). Factors that will decide how the patient proceeds along the diagnostic and therapeutic pathway will include performance status, life expectancy, whether or not a suitable target for CT-guided biopsy is present, the size of the pleural effusion, the likelihood that the lung will re-expand, consideration of whether a pleuro- desis is indicated and, if so, the pros and cons of talc slurry versus talc poudrage in the individual case. Clearly, poor performance and/or limited life expectancy are factors that will argue against the use of thoracoscopy, whether local anaesthetic or VATS. A clear target for CT-guided biopsy may lead to selection of this technique as the next investigation after pleural aspiration but, if a talc poudrage pleurodesis is intended, the physician may still opt for thoracoscopy instead. The size of the pleural effusion will guide whether or not local anaesthetic thoracoscopy is possible, but no hard and fast rule as to size can be applied as the decision will depend on the indi- vidual case and the level of operator training and experience, with more experienced physicians undertaking the procedure on smaller effusions than those who are less experienced. In the case of a small or absent pleural effusion, thoracoscopy may involve the induction of a pneumothorax and would therefore usually be carried out by more experienced operators (eg, level II operators, see below). 'Blind 'closed pleural biopsy may be used in institutions in which other further diagnostic techniques are not readily available locally. It should be noted that this technique is asso- ciated with a signi cantly poorer diagnostic yield compared with image-guided or thoracoscopic procedures, except in the case of suspected TB pleuritis. Overall, blind closed pleural biopsy should therefore only be considered if TB is a possible diagnosis and the patient lives in a high TB prevalence exudative pleural effusions should be subject to routine clinical audit to include diagnostic yield and delay caused by missed diagnoses and the need for further procedures. Where any technique is found to achieve low diagnostic rates or results in diagnostic or treatment delays, the procedure should be abandoned in favour of strate- gies with a higher diagnostic yield and less treatment delay. Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy should not in general be considered a rst-line investigation where more simple diag- nostic strategies (eg, aspiration cytology) have not yet been tried. However, as the procedure offers the opportunity for both diagnosis and therapy in a single sitting, it is not unreasonable (especially if the pretest probability of malignant mesothelioma is high) to use thoracoscopy early in the diagnostic investigation to prevent multiple pleural procedures. While local anaesthetic thoracoscopy is usually undertaken in cytology negative patients, it may still be appropriate in the case of a con rmed cytology positive malignant effusion. A positive cytological diagnosis on pleural fluid may be suf cient to guide further management, but where cytology is only able to con rm the presence of 'suspicious 'cells or in patients in whom accurate histology will change treatment (eg, small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, differentiating adenocarcinoma from mesothe- lioma), local anaesthetic thoracoscopy may be indicated. In cases of highly chemotherapy sensitive tumours (eg, lymphoma, small cell lung cancer), treatment of the underlying cancer is likely to result in resolution of pleural effusion without recourse to drainage or pleurodesis. Local anaesthetic thoraco- scopic poudrage for pleural fluid control is therefore not recommended where such a diagnosis is established on the basis of other investigations, and where chemotherapy is planned. A CT scan is not an absolute requirement prior to thoraco- scopy but is strongly recommended. A thoracic CT scan prior to the procedure allows accurate identi cation of pleural nodularity in the presence of pleural fluid.2It may also permit identi cation of an underlying obstructing bronchial carcinoma where the appropriate next step is bronchoscopy. In addition, a prior thoracic CT scan allows accurate pretreatment staging. The order of investigations will depend on the details of the indi- vidual cases and on local resource provision. The medical thoracoscopist should have the facility to discuss selected cases with local cardiothoracic centres to establish whether a surgical procedure (VATS/thoracotomy) or a local anaesthetic thoracoscopy is the optimal treatm ent strategy for each individual case. This will involve a discussion of the balance between the risks and bene ts of the two approaches in the individual patient. LEVELS OF COMPETENCE IN LOCAL ANAESTHETIC THORACOSCOPY This section de nes three levels of medical thoracoscopic practice that are current in European countries and are likely to be re flected in UK respiratory medicine as local anaesthetic thoracoscopy becomes more widely practised. Information specifying the required training to gain competence at each level in local anaesthetic thoracoscopy is not speci ed here but will be available after consultation with the appropriate training committees at a later date. Annual audit of diagnostic/compli- cation rates is encouraged for all procedures. Level I This includes basic diagnostic and therapeutic techniques and is likely to be the level of competence at which the majority of district general physicians practise. A medical thoracoscopist practising at this level of competence should be able to:1. manage patients who have large pleural effusions; however, in some instances, and as experience increases, a level I thoracoscopist may undertake the procedure in patients with smaller effusions; 2. biopsy the parietal but not the visceral pleura; 3. undertake therapeutic talc insuf flation. A level I thoracoscopist should be able to supervise training, subject to having performed suf cient unsupervised and audited thoracoscopies him/herself. Level II This is the level of competence practised in the setting of a regional service and will involve more experienced practitioners within a unit with a major interest in pleural disease. Such operators should be competent in (1), (2) and (3) plus some of the other procedures listed below: 1. level I techniques; 2. undertaking local lysis of adhesions and lavage in the setting of a loculated or infected pleural space; 6. talc pleurodesis in patients with secondary pneumothorax unsuitable for general anaesthetic/VATS; 7. in some cases, expertise in other techniques such as sympathectomy. Level III This level covers all VATS techniques (eg, lung resection) and is currently the province of the thoracic surgeon. It is beyond the remit of this document. Competing interests No member of the Guideline Group is aware of any competing interests.

Doctors in most specialities will be exposed to patients requiring pleural drainage and need to be aware of safe techniques. There have been many reports of the dangers of large-bore chest drains and it had been anticipated that, with the previous guidelines, better training and the advent of small-bore Seldinger technique chest drains, there would have been an improve- ment. Unfortunately the descriptions of serious complications continue, and in 2008 the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) issued a report making recommendations for safer practice.1These updated guidelines take into consideration the recommendations from this report and describe the technique of pleural aspiration and Seldinger chest drain insertion and ultrasound guidance. Much of this guideline consists of descriptions of how to do these procedures but, where possible, advice is given when evidence is available. TRAINING <All doctors expected to be able to insert a chest drain should be trained using a combination of didactic lecture, simulated practice and supervised practice until considered competent. ( U) Before undertaking an invasive pleural procedure, all operators should be appropriately trained and have been initially supervised by an experienced trainer. Many of the complications described in the NPSA report were the result of inadequate training or supervision. A recent survey of UK NHS Trusts showed that the majority did not have a formal training policy for chest drain insertion in 2008.2 Studies of clinical practice have shown that there is a wide variation in the knowledge and skills of doctors inserting chest drains. In a published study3 where doctors were asked to indicate where they would insert a chest drain, 45% indicated they would insert the drain outside of the safety triangle, with the majority of incorrect answers being too low. Knowledge of the correct position was higher in the group with cardiothoracic surgery experience and higher in doctors with competence to insert drains without supervision. Training should include a theoretical component describing the risks and technique, as outlined in this document, prior to assessed manikin practice and nally supervised procedure until considered competent. In the UK it is currently part of thecurriculum for core medical training and trainees should be expected to describe the procedure and complications in an examination. The trainee should ensure each procedure is documented in their log book and signed by the trainer. A Directly Observed Practice (DOP) assessment should be completed in support of this. Studies of training involving didactic lectures, manikin practice and following protocols, including use of sedation and anaesthesia, have shown the risk of complications and patient pain and anxiety can be reduced4and trainee knowledge and con - dence in the procedures may be increased.5 The use of simulators has been compared with the use of animal models for blunt dissection as part of ATLS training. Forty-one trainees and 21 experts were asked to evaluate a simulator compared with an animal model and they were found to be equivalent in most areas apart from anatomical landmarks where the simulator was superior and the blunt dissection where the animal model was superior.6 Training for thoracic ultrasound should follow the principles set out by the Royal College of Radiologists and is described in greater detail later in this document. These guidelines will aid the training of junior doctors in these procedures and should be readily available for consultation by all doctors likely to be required to carry out pleural aspiration or chest tube insertion. An algorithm for the insertion of a chest drain is shown in gure 1. PRE-PROCEDURE PREPARATION Timing of procedures <Pleural procedures should not take place out of hours except in an emergency. ( U) Complications of most surgical procedures are higher when performed after midnight. Most pleural procedures do not need to be performed as an emergency and therefore should not be carried out overnight except in the case of signi cant respiratory or cardiovascular compromise. It may be considered in certain circumstances that pleural aspiration is safer than a chest drain. Aseptic technique <Pleural aspirations and chest drains should be inserted in a clean area using full aseptic technique.

(C) Patients known to be receiving anticoagulants or in whom there is a suspected coagulopathy (eg, liver failure) should have their prothrombin time (PT) or international normalised ratio (INR) measured prior to a non-urgent pleural procedure. In the case of a tension pneumothorax, it may be necessary to insert a drain rst before correcting an abnormal INR. McVay et al7retro- spectively reviewed 608 cases undergoing paracentesis or pleural aspiration and found that mild coagulopathy, de ned as an INR <1.5 or platelet counts 50 e99 109/l, did not adversely affect the risk of bleeding with a fall in haemoglobin of 2 g/dl occurring in only 3.1% and 0.2% requiring transfusion. If a patient has abnormal coagulation and requires an invasive pleural procedure, the advice of the local haematologist should be sought regarding the correct action needed to normalise the clotting. PLEURAL ASPIRATION (THORACOCENTESIS) Pleural aspiration describes a procedure whereby pleural fluid or air may be aspirated via a system inserted temporarily into the pleural space. This may be for diagnostic purposes (usually removing 20 e50 ml fluid) or therapeutic to relieve symptoms. In the literature it is varyingly called thoracocentesis, thoracentesis or pleural aspiration. Indications The indications for pleural aspiration are shown in box 1.Preparation and consent Before performing a pleural aspiration, operators should ensure documented consent is obtained and that they are either competent or supervised to do the pleural aspiration. They should be aware of the indication for the procedure, whether it is diagnostic or therapeutic and have all equipment ready. The consent procedure should encompass the indications for the procedure, alternatives to the procedure and the common and serious complications. Complications <The commonest complications from pleural aspiration are pneumothorax, procedure failure, pain and haemor- rhage. The most serious complication is visceral injury. These complications should be included in any consent process .(U) A number of factors have been reported to increase the frequency of complications following pleural aspiration. The broadest agreement across the studies examined was that Box 1 Indications for pleural aspiration Pneumothorax* <Spontaneous primary pneumothorax (any size) <Small secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in patients under 50 years Malignant pleural effusions* <Small volume aspiration for diagnosis <Larger volume aspiration to relieve symptoms of dyspnoea Pleural effusion associated with sepsis (suspected empyema)* <Diagnostic for decision to drain * Refer to specic guidelines for further detail.Figure 1 Algorithm for the insertion of a chest drain.

Ultrasound guidance strongly recommendedSeek senior helpInsert drainConsider pleural aspiration to relieve symptoms and delay a drain insertion until working hours and when appropriate expertise and or supervision is experience and the use of image guidance reduced the frequency of complications. A xed effects meta- analysis calculation of the complication frequency across all the studies examined according to these two factors is shown in table 1. Other factors such as the needle size used and the volume of fluid aspirated have been shown in a few studies to have an effect and are discussed below. Underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease8, previous radiotherapy9and previous pleural aspiration10have also been suggested as risk factors in individual studies and more evidence is required before recommendations can be made. In many studies pneumothorax is the most commonly occurring complication following pleural aspiration, but the pathophysiology of post-aspiration pneumothorax is likely to be multifactorial. Some pneumothoraces are undoubtedly caused by lung injury or introduction of air during the procedure. However, Boland et al, in a retrospective study of 512 pleural fluid aspirations, found that 17 of the 29 pneumothoraces requiring catheter drainage did not resolve with drainage. They termed this an 'ex vacuo 'pneumothorax. All of the 17 patients had malignant parenchymal lung disease. Interestingly, despite the presence of the ex vacuo pneumothorax, 14 of the patients found an improvement of their dyspnoea after the aspiration of their pleural effusion.11 The authors concluded that these pneumothoraces occurred due to unexpandable lung underlying the pleural effusion dwhat many sources refer to as 'trapped lung '. The aspiration of the pleural fluid then causes signi cantly low pressure within the pleural space and air is drawn in. The mechanism by which this occurs has not been fully determined. Other authors have supported this view.12 Ponrartana et alconrmed the nding that chest drain insertion as a treatment of an ex vacuo pneumothorax is unlikely to be helpful in decreasing the size of the pneumothorax. They also found that the presence of an ex vacuo pneumothorax in the context of malignant disease is associated with a poor prognosis.13 We conclude that, if an ex vacuo pneumothorax occurs after drainage of a pleural effusion due to non-expansile or trapped lung, the pneumothorax should not routinely be drained. Drainage of the pleural effusion if it recurs may bring symp- tomatic relief. Indwelling pleural catheters may be useful in this context. Only one case of injury to a solid viscus was found in the context of a cohort or case series,14although several examples of other visceral injuries are published in case reports. Despite the low reported frequency, studies of the accuracy of clinically placed pleural aspiration sites have revealed signi cant potential for visceral injury15 16and this is discussed further in the section on image guidance (below).Image guidance <A recent chest radiograph should be available prior to performing a pleural aspiration. ( U) <Thoracic ultrasound guidance is strongly recommended for all pleural procedures for pleural fluid. (B) <The marking of a site using thoracic ultrasound for subsequent remote aspiration or chest drain insertion is not recommended except for large pleural effusions. (C) A recent chest x-ray is necessary to con rm the indication for the procedure and the side of the pathology. This should be correlated with the clinical signs. The only exception should be the case of a tension pneumothorax. Ultrasound-guided pleural aspiration is associated with a lower failure rate and complication rate (see table 1). The procedure failures or 'dry taps 'can themselves have further clinically signi cant complications such as visceral injury.14 Some studies have shown that pleural aspiration in the hands of experienced operators can achieve low complication rates when conducted without image guidance.17 18T able 1 also shows that the use of image guidance can reduce the post-procedure complications even of experienced operators, and a large study of clinical placement of pleural aspiration sites found that inaccurate site placement was independent of operator experience.15 There are four studies directly comparing blind pleural aspi- ration against an ultrasound-guided procedure. In a small rand- omised controlled trial (n \u00bc52) the failure rate (a composite of dry tap and pneumothorax) was 33% with a blind procedure compared with no failures with ultrasound guidance.19In a larger retrospective cohort study (n \u00bc342)20the pneumothorax rate was 18% in the clinically localised pleural aspiration group compared with 3% in the ultrasound-guided group. Within the clinical localisation group were 48 patients with prior ultrasound marking in the radiology department but ward-based pleural aspiration (ie, 'X marks the spot '); subanalysis of this group did not show any difference in the complication rate compared with clinical localisation only. Similarly, Kohan et aldid not show any difference in complications between clinically sited versus remote ultrasound guidance ( 'X marks the spot ').21Another retrospective cohort study (n \u00bc523) showed a pneumothorax rate of 10.3% (4.9% requiring a drain) in the blind procedure group compared with 4.9% (0.7% requiring a drain) in the ultrasound-guided group.22 A large proportion of these failed blind procedures are prob- ably due to inaccurate clinical site selection. In a study by Diacon et al,15clinicians were only able to identify a site for a pleural aspiration in 67% of patients with a pleural effusion. In the cohort where a site was identi ed, 15% were inaccurate and would have resulted in puncture of the lung, liver or spleen. Where the clinician was unable to identify a site for aspiration, ultrasound localised a suitable site for aspiration in 54%. Overall, Table 1 Complication rates of pleural aspiration by operator and image guidance Ultrasound guidance OperatorFrequency of post-procedure pneumothoraxFrequency that a chest drain was required post procedureFrequency of dry tap/procedure failure Yes Radiologist in Senior physician 5.7% 1.4% 1.6% The calculations and references used in this table are shown in appendix 1 in puncture in 10% of the procedures and increased the rate of accurate sites by 26%. Thoracic ultrasound or other imaging is very important following a failed blind pleural aspiration. In a study of 26 patients who had a failed clinically-guided pleural aspiration, 38% had the procedure performed at the incorrect site, 31% had no pleural fluid present, 11% had loculations and 11% had intervening parenchymal consolidation or tumour. Factors associated with failure were a small pleural effusion, loculations and a sharp costophrenic angle on the chest x-ray. Operator inexperience was not associated with failure. Ultrasound-guided pleural aspiration was subsequently successful in 15 of the 17 patients in whom it was attempted.16Similarly, Kohan et al demonstrated the ef cally localised pleural aspiration fails, image guidance should be performed and no further clinical attempts should be made. Thoracic ultrasound is also useful in the presence of unilateral 'white-out 'or opaque hemithorax on the chest x-ray. In a prospective study of 50 patients, nine had no pleural effusion present on thoracic ultrasound23thereby avoiding inappropriate pleural aspiration and potential procedure-related injury. It could be argued that thoracic ultrasound may not be neces- sary when aspirating a large pleural effusion that does not cause complete opaci cation of the hemithorax. In a randomised controlled trial comparing blind pleural aspiration against ultra- sound guidance, there was a signi cantly higher incidence of dry taps in the presence of a small pleural effusion (obliterating less than half of the hemidiaphragm) and loculated pleural effusion. There was no difference in the rate of dry tap in the presence of a large pleural effusion.21However, even in this instance, image guidance will reveal underlying abnormalities that are not apparent on plain lm radiology such as cardiac enlargement or displacement, a raised diaphragm or adherent lung. Overall, ultrasound-guided pleural aspiration has been shown to increase the yield and reduce the risk of complica- tions, particularly pneumothoraces and inadvertent organ puncture. However, it should be noted that ultrasound may not reduce the incidence of laceration of the intercostal vessels because they are not visualised on ultrasound.24The evidence leads us to conclude that, wherever possible, site selection for all pleural aspiration should be u ltrasound-guided. Ultrasound guidance is strongly recommended when attempting to aspi- rate any pleural effusion. It is even more important when aspirating small or loculated pl eural effusions where there is a near or completely radio-opaqu e hemithorax, particularly in the absence of mediastinum shift away from the side of the lesion or when a clinically-guided attempt has been unsuc- cessful. However, the use of image guidance does not replace the need for clinical judgement, especially when siting the needle within the intercostal space. The use of ultrasound also requires training and expertise as described later in this document. Patient position and site of insertion <The preferred site for insertion of the needle for pleural aspiration should be the triangle of safety. ( U) In determining the correct patient position and site of insertion, it is important for the operator to be aware of the normal anatomy of the thorax and the pathology of the patient. Patient position is dependent on the operator preference and the site of the pathology. In the case of a posterior lying locule, this may be speci c to the image-guided spot where fluid is most likely to be obtained. In most circumstances, however, the site of insertionof the needle is either in the triangle of safety ( gure 2) or the second intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. The patient may therefore either sit upright leaning forward with arms elevated but resting on a table or bed, thereby exposing the axilla, or lying on a bed in a position similar to that described in the section on chest drain insertion below. The needle is inserted in the space just above a rib to avoid damaging the neurovascular bundle. It is common practice to insert the needle more posteriorly for a pleural aspiration, but it should be noted that the neurovascular bundle may not be covered by the lower flange of the rib in this position25and a more lateral or anterior site of insertion is considered safer. Equipment Pleural aspiration should be aseptic and therefore sterile gloves, a sterile eld, skin sterilising fluid and a clean dressing are needed. For a simple diagnostic pleural aspiration a 21G (green) needle and a 50 ml syringe is suf cient to obtain a sample. If aspiration of air or a larger sample of fluid is required (therapeutic tap), there are a number of commercially available kits to perform a pleural aspiration although it is often performed in the UK by adapting easily available equipment for the purpose. Most commonly this is an intravenous cannula attached to a three-way tap and tubing/syringe. The tip of the tubing can then be directed into a suitable receptacle for sampling or disposal, or an underwater seal if required. Aseptic technique <Pleural aspiration should take place in a clean area using full aseptic technique. ( U) Empyema is a serious and avoidable complication of pleural aspiration, the risk of which is greater with multiple attempts. It is recommended that strict asepsis should be employed, espe- cially when carrying out therapeutic aspirations. Size of needle <Pleural aspiration with large-bore needles should be avoided. (C) The use of large-bore needles for pleural aspiration probably increases the risk of developing post-procedure pneumothorax. In addition, if a vascular or visceral injury does inadvertently occur, the use of a large-bore needle is likely to result in more damage than a small-bore needle. Several studies have linked the use of larger bore needles to an increased rate of post-procedure pneumothorax, although needle Figure 2 The 'triangle of safety'. The triangle is bordered anteriorly by the lateral edge of pectoralis major, laterally by the lateral edge of latissimus dorsi, inferiorly by the line of the fth intercostal space and superiorly by the prime focus of any study. A large retro- spective study and a small prospective study both demonstrated a signi cantly higher pneumothorax rate after pleural aspira- tions performed with needle sizes larger than 20G.1920However, a non-randomised prospective study of three different needle types which were different sizes found no difference in the post- procedure pneumothorax rate.10 T wo other retrospective studies found an increased rate of post-procedure pneumothorax when using larger bore needles. However, both studies were confounded because the larger needles were used to aspirate larger volumes of pleural fluid which itself may increase the rate of complications.1226 The choice of needle length may have to be adjusted in patients with thick thoracic walls. A CT-based study of 53 Scottish patients found that the depth to the pleura was >4.5 cm in the mid-hemithorax line in the second intercostal space in up to 13.2% and up to 47.2% in the mid-axillary line in thefth intercostal space.27This result needs to be interpreted with caution because the tissue thickness in the mid-axillary line will be increased in the supine position owing to soft tissue falling to the side by gravity. Additionally, the soft tissue is often compressible and so a standard needle may be adequate to reach the pleura even if the depth is >4.5 cm on CT imaging. T wo studies have measured chest wall thickness on CT scans and found that a standard 40 mm long needle may not be adequate to reach the pleural space in the second intercostal space in some patients. One study was in American military personnel28and the other was in a Canadian population.29 A reference for needle and chest drain sizes can be found in appendix 2 in the online supplement. Technique Thoracic ultrasound should be performed before undertaking pleural aspiration. In the case of a diagnostic pleural aspiration, a syringe attached to a green needle is inserted into the pleural space using the technique described below and 20 e50 ml of fluid withdrawn and sent for investigations as discussed in the guideline on investigation of a pleural effusion. Local anaesthesia is not required for a simple procedure but should be considered if difculty attaining the pleural space is likely (ie, with an inex- perienced operator or if the patient has a thick chest wall). Skin cleansing and an aseptic technique should be used. In the case of a therapeutic aspiration, local anaesthetic should be administered as described in the section on chest drains below. The pleural space should be aspirated with the needle used to administer the local anaesthetic and the depth of the pleural space can then be con rmed. The aspiration needle or cannula should then be advanced into the chest, aspirating continually until the pleura is breached and air or fluid are withdrawn, paying close attention to the depth of the pleural space. The cannula should then be attached to a three-way tap andfluid/air withdrawn into the syringe and expelled via the free port of the three-way tap. This may be into a bag or jug for fluid, or into air or a tube inserted into a bottle under water acting as a one-way seal to prevent air being entrained. This process should be repeated and continued until the procedure is terminated. The cannula is then removed and a simple dressing applied. Volume of removal, re-expansion pulmonary oedema and the use of pleural manometry <Theprocedureshouldbestoppedwhennomore fluid orair can be aspirated, the patient develops symptoms of cough or chest discomfort or 1.5 l has been withdrawn. (C)The maximum volume which can be aspirated is subject to debate as there is concern that re-expansion pulmonary oedema (RPO) may occur and that the frequency of post-procedure pneumothorax may increase if larger volumes of fluid are withdrawn. The rate of RPO has been quoted as being anywhere between 0.2% and 14%. In more recent studies30e32the incidence of clinical RPO is <1% but asymptomatic radiologically-apparent RPO may be slightly more frequent. It is unlikely to occur if <1l is withdrawn, but it is less clear how cases at risk of RPO can be predicted at higher volumes. The amount of fluid which may be safely removed at one time continues to be debated and in many studies up to 3 l has been safely aspirated. Aspiration of up to 6.5 l30without complication has been described. Advice has generally been conservative because of the morbidity associated with RPO and a mortality rate quoted as high as 20%.33 In a retrospective study of 735 pleural aspirations, Josephson et al found that draining 1.8 e2.2 l was associated with a three- fold increase in the frequency of post-procedure pneumothoraces compared with draining 0.8 e1.2 l. They also found that draining >2.3 l was associated with an almost sixfold increase, although this subset only consisted of 21 procedures.34Similar ndings were made in other retrospective studies,12 20 26although another failed to show any difference.10 It is possible that the association between the volume of fluid drained and the increase in occurrence of post-procedure pneu- mothorax is due in part to underlying trapped lung. If a greater volume of fluid is drained, then an underlying trapped lung is more likely to be revealed. This mechanism of post-aspiration pneu- mothorax has been discussed previously in the section on complications. Although the safe aspiration of much larger volumes has been documented, it is also clear that complications are uncommon when aspirating <1.5 l. This is therefore the recommended volume to be aspirated at one attempt. If symptomatic RPO does occur, the mainstay of management should be close cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring and oxygen therapy which is suf cient in many cases.3536Contin- uous positive airways pressure (CPAP) has been used in a number of cases with success.37 38If using CPAP, caution should be taken to avoid recurrent pneumothorax and potential tension pneumothorax if the RPO has occurred following the aspiration of a pneumothorax and there is no pleural drain in place. The use of diuretics30 39and steroids39have also been described, although there is little evidence to support it and some authors counsel against their use.36 Pleural manometry is a technique whereby the pleural pres- sure is measured by connecting a water- lled manometer or an electric transducer to the thoracocentesis catheter via a three- way tap. This enables the initial pleural pressure to be measured and at intervals throughout the thoracentesis. While the initial pressure does not predict the pathology of the fluid, the pressure is most negative in cases of trapped lung. It is proposed in the papers describing this procedure that thoracentesis should be terminated when the pleural pressure falls to less than /C020 cm H2O as this could predict the risk of RPO, the value being based on animal models. While there have been no randomised controlled trials to con rm this, in the cases series described there were no cases of RPO by using this method with >6lo f fluid being removed.40 Pleural manometry is not currently in clinical practice in the UK, there are no comparative studies and there is no commer- cially-designed equipment speci a simple pleural aspiration is not required unless air is withdrawn, the procedure is difcult, multiple attempts are required or the patient becomes symptomatic. (C) It is current practice to request a chest x-ray after pleural aspi- ration to exclude a pneumothorax. In a study of 278 cases of pleural aspiration Petersen et alassessed the ability of physicians to detect signi cant post-aspiration pneumothoraces. Of the 15 patients in whom the physician suspected a post-procedure pneumothorax, nine were subsequently found to have a pneu- mothorax. In all nine, air was freely aspirated at the time of the procedure. Only 2.3 e3.3% of the cases in which no pneumo- thorax was suspected were subsequently found to have one, and all of these cases used a vacuum bottle to aspirate the pleural effusion.41Another study9showed that, in 174 pleural aspira- tions, ve out of eight of the pneumothoraces that occurred were expected and none of the unsuspected cases required intervention. T wo of the ve cases with pneumothorax had had multiple procedures.9Capizzi et al found that pneumothorax was present in ve of 54 chest x-rays performed after pleural aspiration for fluid as outpatients and no symptomatic compli- cations were found in a further 50 cases who did not have a chest x-ray.42 We conclude that the physician performing an aspiration can usually predict the presence or absence of a clinically signi cant post-procedure pneumothorax and therefore a post-aspiration chest x-ray is not routinely needed. The use of vacuum bottles during aspiration can hinder the operator 's ability to detect inadvertently aspirated air. INSERTION OF CHEST DRAINS A chest drain is a tube which is placed in the pleural space to drain its contents ( fluid or air) and remains in place until drainage is complete. Indications The indications for chest drain insertion are shown in box 2. Consent <Written consent should be obtained for chest drain insertions, except in emergency situations. The General Medical Council (GMC) guideline43'Consent: P atients and Doctors Making Decisions T ogether 'states that it is the responsibility of the doctor carrying out a procedure or an appropriately trained individual with suf cient knowledge ofa procedure to explain its nature and the risks associated with it in a language which is understandable to the patient. It is within the rights of a competent individual patient to refuse such treatment, and patients without mental capacity should be treated following the appropriate advice given in the GMC guidance. As insertion of a chest drain is a procedure associated with signi cant risk, consent should be obtained in writing and should include the commonest and most serious complications as outlined below and also the possibility of treatment failure. In the case of an emergency when the patient is unconscious and the treatment is lifesaving, treatment may be carried out but must be explained as soon as the patient is suf ciently recovered to understand. An information lea flet should be given where available prior to the procedure (see appendix 3 in online supplement). Complications <Pain, intrapleural infection, wound infection, drain dislodgement and drain blockage are the most frequent complications of small-bore chest drain insertion. Visceral injury is the most serious complication. All of these possible sequelae should be detailed in the consent process. ( U) <Pain, intrapleural infection, wound infection, drain- related visceral injury and drain blockage are the most frequent complications of large-bore chest drain inser- tion. All of these possible sequelae should be detailed in the consent process. ( U) Numerous case reports have described a range of serious complications associated with chest drains including visceral puncture and serious bleeding, which fortunately are rare. There are also reports of nerve damage to both the intercostal nerves during insertion and nerve bundles within the thoracic cavity from the drain itself (Horner 's syndrome being one of the more commonly recorded), but these also seem to be sporadic cases. A survey of UK NHS Trusts found that the majority of them had experienced a major complication following a chest drain insertion between 2003 and 2008. There were 17 fatalities reported during this time which were mainly due to misplaced drains.2Complications have been reported to be highest in large- bore chest drains inserted in trauma patients using the trocar technique. The lowest reported complication rates are seen in studies where small drains are inserted by consultant radiolo- gists. It is likely that complications are reduced by using ultra- sound guidance and this has been recommended by the NPSA.1 The most commonly occurring complications in the studies examined are shown in tables 2 and 3. Pneumothorax is also commonly reported, but the aetiology is multifactorial ranging from lung injury and introduction of air to 'trapped lung ', which is not regarded as a procedural complication (see section on pleural aspiration). Simple pneumothoraces are easily dealt with by the chest drain itself and, where possible, we have reported lung injury under the 'injury 'column in tables 2 and 3.Box 2 Indications for chest drain insertion Pneumothorax* <In any ventilated patient <Tension pneumothorax after initial needle relief <Persistent or recurrent pneumothorax after simple aspiration <Large secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in patients aged >50 Refer to specic guidelines for further detail.Table 2 Frequency of post-insertion complications for small drains (#16 F) Complication Total no.*Calculated frequency Range Studies Injury 582 0 48 e52 *Total number of procedures performed from the studies found cases of haemothorax as a complication; these are also reported in the 'injury 'column. T ables 2 and 3 are separated into small-bore drains and large- bore drains for ease of reference, although they cannot be directly compared owing to signi cant differences in the inser- tion technique, the use of image guidance and the indications for the drains to be inserted. These differences are described in more detail in the table in appendix 4 in the online supplement. There is also a range of operator experience in the studies with a tendency for small-bore image-guided drains to be inserted by more senior operators; these factors are likely to explain the different malposition rates for the two types of drain. Antibiotic prophylaxis <Antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended for non- trauma patients requiring a chest drain. ( U) <Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered for trauma patients requiring chest drains, especially after pene- trating trauma. (A) The rate of empyema and wound infection in trauma cases has been reported to be as high as 5.8 e13%. A number of stud- ies,62e68including a meta-analysis69 70of 507 cases of thoracic trauma requiring chest drainage comparing empirical antibiotics with placebo, showed an absolute reduction in infection and empyema in the treatment group of 5.5% (OR 5.27 in favour of giving antibiotics). It should be noted, however, that these studies were of different types of thoracic trauma (blunt and penetrating) and occurred in predominantly young male patients in a variety of settings. In addition, the environment in which the chest drain was inserted may not have been fully aseptic in some cases. The antibiotics used have varied from study to study, but all have shown a reduction in the infection rates. The studies are summarised in the evidence table which is available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk. The use of antibiotic prophylaxis in medically inserted chest drains has not been studied but, given the low rates of infection and the risk of hospital-acquired infections such as Clostridium difcileand the older age group of these patients, it cannot be recommended at this time. Equipment The equipment required is shown in box 3. Size of drain <Small drains should be used as rst-line therapy for pneumothorax, free flowing pleural effusions and pleural infection. (C) Traditionally, large-bore drains were recommended and inserted using a blunt dissection technique. With the increased avail- ability of small drains and use of the Seldinger technique this has now become the most common mode of chest drain insertion,such that many trainee doctors are not able to insert large-bore drains except emergency doctors or surgeons who have under- gone ATLS training. Small-bore chest drains have a low risk of serious complica- tions, as demonstrated in table 2. Small-bore catheters have signicantly lower pain scores and analgesia requirements and a greater degree of comfort than in comparable patients in whom large-bore catheters have been inserted for the same indication.7172Davies et al described high overall complication rates (42%) with small-bore drains, but the majority of these were dislodgement (21%), blockage (9%) or pain (5%).51Collop et al also described a higher complication rate with small-bore drains (36%) than with large-bore drains (9%). In this study, however, the small-bore drain group was substantially smaller (11 patients vs 115 patients) and the complications were less severe (malposition, blockage and kinking in the small-bore drain group versus one episode of possible lung laceration and a site infection as well as others in the large-bore drain group).52 The relatively low risk of complications with small-bore drains inserted using the Seldinger technique is generally accepted, but there is greater debate regarding the effectiveness of small-bore drains in various clinical situations. One of the arguments put forward for using larger drains is the greater flow that is possible as predicted by Poiseuille 's law. However, the maximum rate of drainage possible through a drain is unlikely to be important when draining a pleural effusion when the rate of flow is usually deliberately controlled. Rate of flow may theoretically be more of an issue when draining pneumothoraces with a persistent high volume air leak. This theoretical advantage is not borne out in the majority of clinical cases of pneumothorax where the use of smaller drains (#14 F)44e4648 50 73had similar rates of success for draining pneumothoraces as the larger drains.44 45 61Liuet al compared conventional chest tubes with small bore (8 e10 F) drains for the management of spontaneous pneumothorax in a retrospective review of a change in their practice and found the success rates to be comparable. Of the 15 patients in their small-bore drain group who needed further management, all went on to receive a conventional chest tube; 4 (27%) resolved with this manage- ment and 11 (73%) subsequently needed surgery.44Other small retrospective studies comparing large and small drains have shown them to be equivalent in the acute management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. One suggested that thereTable 3 Frequency of post-insertion complications for large-bore drains ($20 F or stated 'large-bore drain') Complication Total no.*Calculated frequency Range Studies *Total number of procedures performed from the studies found that quote this complication.Box 3 Equipment <Sterile gloves and gown <Skin antiseptic drapes <Gauze swabs <A selection silk) <Instrument for blunt dissection if required (eg, curved clamp) <Guide wire and dilators for Seldinger technique <Chest tube <Connecting tubing <Closed drainage system (including sterile water if underwater seal being used) <Dressing Equipment may also be available in 65(Suppl 2):ii61 eii76. doi:10.1136/thx.2010.137026 ii67BTS guidelinesis a higher rate of recurrence associated with the use of small- bore drains,74although this has not been borne out in other studies.44 75 Small-bore chest drains inserted by the Seldinger technique are therefore recommended as rst-line therapy for spontaneous pneumothoraces and iatrogenic pneumothoraces; however, a larger bore drain may be needed in cases of very large air leaks, especially postoperatively. Drainage of simple pleural effusions is also effectively done with a small-bore drain.45e4961It is likely that the limiting factor when using a small-bore chest drain is the connecting of a two- or three-way tap as this has a narrower bore than the drain.76 Parulekar et al and Clementsen et al compared small-bore and large-bore drains when draining malignant pleural effusions and performing sclerotherapy.71 77They found no difference between the two groups with regard to time taken to drain the effusion prior to sclerotherapy or the effectiveness of the scle- rotherapy. Clementsen et al also showed that the small-bore drain group found the experience of drain insertion and the presence of the drain a less unpleasant experience than those in the large-bore drain group.71 We recommend that small-bore drains are the rst choice for draining pleural effusions. The use of small-bore drains to drain empyemas has a very variable success rate across studies.45e47 78e81The most common problem is drain blockage45 46and drain dislodge- ment.51It is likely that the limiting factor when using a small- bore chest drain is the connecting of a two- or three-way tap as this often has a narrower bore than the drain.76Davies et al suggest that regular flushing reduces the rate of drain blockage51 and studies that employed regular flushing of the drains with either saline or a brinolytic drug have higher therapeutic success rates.78e81 We therefore recommend that image-guided small-bore drains should be used as rst-line therapy for the treatment of empyema. Regular flushing is probably helpful but needs further investigation. More than one drain may be needed to achieve successful drainage. Subsequent drains may be necessary to drain separate loculations or to replace drains that have become blocked.4679 80 Large-bore drains may be helpful if small-bore drainage fails but, equally, image-guided small-bore drainage can be thera- peutically fails.8082 83 Analgesia and sedation <To reduce pain associated with chest drains, analgesia should be considered as premedication and should be prescribed for all patients with a chest drain in place.

(U) Chest drain insertion has been reported to be a painful procedure with 50% of patients experiencing pain levels of 9 e10 on a scale of 10 in one study4and therefore premedication should be considered. Despite the apparent common sense of this approach, there is little established evidence of the effect from these medications and there are concerns for the safety of this approach in operators unfamiliar with safe sedation techniques. The Royal College of Anaesthetists in association with the Academy of Royal Colleges issued guidance for conscious seda- tion, and doctors should be familiar with these guidelines before employing this technique.84 Premedication could be with an intravenous anxiolytic e2 mg titrated to analgesic (eg, 2.5 mg intravenous morphine given immedi- ately prior to the procedure or 10 mg oromorph 1 h prior to the procedure). No single technique has been shown to be clearly superior. Both these classes of drugs may cause respiratory depression and all patients who receive them should be observed. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are particularly at risk and require extra care when using these drugs. Reversal agents (eg, naloxone or flumazenil) are occa- sionally necessary and should always be immediately accessible if using intravenous opiates or benzodiazepines. Intravenous access should be maintained throughout the procedure and oxygen saturation should be monitored continuously. Sedation should allow the patient to remain conversant throughout the procedure and should be combined with a sensitive explanation during the procedure with reassurance. While the use of atropine as part of premedication for breoptic bronchoscopy has been assessed, no controlled trials of its use in chest tube insertion were found although it is advo- cated in some centres. Case reports of vasovagal reactions and a death due to vagal stimulation following tube insertion may support its use as premedication. Patient position and site of insertion The preferred position for standard drain insertion is on the bed, slightly rotated, with the arm on the side of the lesion behind the patient 's head ( gure 3A) or on the hips to expose the axillary area or in the lateral decubitus position ( gure 3C). An alternative is for the patient to sit upright leaning over an adjacent table with a pillow under the arms ( gure 3B). Insertion should be in the 'triangle of safety 'illustrated in gure 2. This is the area bordered by the lateral edge of the latissimus dorsi, the lateral border of the pectoralis major muscle Figure 3 Common patient positions for chest drain insertion. (A) Semi-reclined with hand behind head. (B) Sitting up leaning over a table with padding. (C) Lateral decubitus level of the fth intercostal space. This position minimises the risk to underlying structures (eg, internal mammary artery) and avoids damage to muscle and breast tissue resulting in unsightly scarring. For apical pneumothoraces the second intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line is sometimes chosen but is not recommended routinely. This position may be uncomfortable for the patient and is more visible if the drain insertion leaves an unsightly scar. It may be the preferred site when using a small drain with an ambulatory drainage system. Loculated apical pneumothoraces are not uncommonly seen following thoracotomy and may be drained using a posteriorly (suprascapular)-sited apical tube. This technique should, however, be performed under image guidance or by an operator experienced in this technique such as a thoracic surgeon. If the drain is to be inserted into a loculated pleural collection, the position of insertion will be dictated by the site of the locule as determined by imaging. Conrming site of insertion <During chest drain insertion an attempt to aspirate the pleural contents with a small needle should be made. If this is not possible, chest drain insertion should not continue .(U) Immediately before the procedure the identity of the patient should be checked and the site and side for insertion of the chest tube con rmed by reviewing the clinical signs and the chest x-ray. Once a safe site for chest drain insertion has been iden- tied and prior to the insertion of a drain, the expected pleural contents (air or fluid) should be aspirated with a small needle, usually while administering local anaesthesia. If none is forth- coming, further imaging is required. Image guidance <It is strongly recommended that all chest drains for fluid should be inserted under image guidance. (B) There is less evidence comparing ultrasound guidance against clinical guidance for chest drain insertion than there is for pleural aspiration. Intuitively, the use of thoracic ultrasound should reduce the risk of drain malposition and complications as the data regarding accuracy of site selection, as described in the pleural aspiration section, is as relevant for chest drain insertion as it is for pleural aspiration. Several studies have successfully used ultrasound-guided small-bore chest drains in the treatment of ef cacy and low complication rates. However, it is difcult to determine the exact contribution of ultrasound as these studies often used mixed modality imaging including CT andfluoroscopy. Ultrasound is useful in guiding the insertion of a chest drain into free- flowing pleural effusions. Keeling47demonstrated that, in a subgroup of 30 patients, image-guided chest drains were 100% successful in treating simple non-infected pleural effu- sions. The majority of drains were inserted using ultrasound guidance. However, in one patient the chest drain was incor- rectly sited within the subcutaneous tissue and was correctly re- sited using CT guidance. There were no serious complications. Several studies have shown that image-guided small drains are effective in the management of pleural infections, particularly when the effusions are loculated. No studies were found that directly compared image-guided drainage with other methods of treatment such as non-image guided small-bore or large-bore drainage. al78have all used ultrasound guidance todirect small-bore drains for the treatment of pleural infection with a success rate of 73 e94%. Ultrasound can be used to direct chest drains into the largest loculation or into two or more separate collections when treating multiloculated effusions with good effect. CT should be used if the abnormalities are poorly visualised on ultrasound.80Van Sonnenberg et al83used the greater positional accuracy of image-guided small-bore catheters to successfully treat patients with empyema who had failed management with conventional chest tube drainage. Of the 17 catheters included in the study, 13 were inserted following failure of standard chest tube therapy (of these, 10 were in the wrong position and 2 were in small locules). Overall, image-guided small-bore drains were successful in 13 of the cases (76.5%). Thoracic ultrasound is of limited utility in guiding insertion of a chest drain in the presence of a pneumothorax because of the difculty in obtaining useful images due to the poor trans- mission of sound waves through air. Aseptic technique <Chest drains should be inserted in a clean area using full aseptic technique including gowns, drapes, sterile gloves and skin cleansing. (C) Although this is uncommon, estimations of the empyema rate following drain insertions are approximately 0.2 e2.4% (tables 2 and 3) for medically inserted chest drains in formal studies but may be higher in routine practice. This may be because, in published studies looking at complication rates, the drains were inserted in dedicated areas in emergency rooms or theatres with full aseptic technique being employed. Infection following chest drain insertion, both cutaneously and within the pleural space, is an avoidable complication of the procedure and we therefore recommend that full aseptic tech- nique including sterile gloves, drapes and gowns is used. We also recommend that chest drains are inserted in a clean area away from sources of contamination and with enough space so that the sterile eld can be preserved. This should be separate from a general ward area. Local anaesthesia <Lidocaine 1% should be in ltrated prior to the proce- dure, paying particular attention to the skin, periostium and the pleura. ( U) Chest drain insertion is described as a very painful procedure by patients and can be improved by better training, use of sedation (see above) and liberal use of local anaesthesia. In centres which undertake medical thoracoscopy, it is recognised that this can be a relatively painless procedure and it is therefore likely that a similar technique applied to chest drain insertion will be successful although there is no evidence to con rm this. Expert opinion is that local anaesthetic is in ltrated into the site of insertion of the drain. A small-gauge needle is used to raise a dermal bleb before deeper in ltration of the intercostal muscles and pleural surface. As the skin, the pleura and periostium are the most sensitive areas, this is where most of the anaesthesia should be in ltrated. A spinal needle may be required in the presence of a thick chest wall, but image guidance is strongly recommended if the pleura cannot be breached by a green needle to ensure localisation of the correct site. Local anaesthetic such as lidocaine (up to 3 mg/kg) is usually inltrated. Higher doses may result in toxic levels. The peak concentration of lidocaine was found to be <3mg/ml (ie, low risk of neurotoxic effects) in 85% of patients given 3 mg/kg intrapleural lidocaine. The volume given is 65(Suppl 2):ii61 eii76. doi:10.1136/thx.2010.137026 ii69BTS guidelinesimportant aid spread of the effective anaes- thetic area and therefore a dilute preparation (1% rather than 2%) is preferable. The use of epinephrine to aid haemostasis and localise the anaesthesia is used in some centres but has not been studied in this context. The use of epinephrine allows up to 5 mg/kg lidocaine to be in ltrated. Insertion technique <Drains should never be inserted using substantial force. (U) <The dilator should not be inserted further than 1 cm beyond the depth from the skin to the pleural space. (U) <Blunt dissection should be employed in cases of trauma or insertion of large-bore drains. (C) Small-bore Seldinger technique The Seldinger technique to insert a chest tube has become the most widespread method of drain insertion since the publication of the previous guidelines in 2003. In many centres it is the only method of drain insertion on medical wards and many doctors have never been trained to insert a drain any other way. When this technique was introduced it was thought it would be an easier and safer way to insert a drain based mainly on the initial experience by radiologists inserting under ultrasound guidance. The technique can be carried out safely by other doctors as long as they are appropriately trained and familiar with the equip- ment used in their hospital. A needle is introduced into the pleural space and the pleural contents should be aspirated at this stage to con rm the position of the needle tip in the pleural space. The depth of the needle when it enters the pleural space is noted. A guide wire is passed through the needle which can be used to gently guide the wire to the apex or the base of the pleural cavity as required. The needle is then withdrawn leaving the guide wire in place and a small skin incision is made. The dilator is then passed gently over the guide wire using a slight twisting action. Many of the reported injuries as a result of chest drain insertion were due to visceral puncture by the dilator. Force is unnecessary and the dilator only needs to be passed 1 cm beyond the depth to the pleura as measured with the introducer needle. By holding the dilator rmly at this depth or using a marker available with some kits, excessive insertion depth can be avoided. The tract is further widened by using a series of enlarging dilators up to the size of the drain. The drain is then inserted gently over the wire aiming upwards for pneumothorax or as appropriate for the fluid to be drained. The depth should be enough to ensure the last drainage hole is well within the pleural space (approximately 5 e10 cm) but does not require insertion to the hilt. The guide wire is then removed leaving the drain in place. The drain should be stoppered until secured and then connected to a drainage system. Large-bore blunt dissection <Surgically inserted chest drains should be inserted by blunt dissection. Trocars should not be used. (C) Once the anaesthetic has taken effect, an incision is made just above and parallel to a rib. This should be slightly bigger than the operator 'snger and tube. Many cases of damage to essential intrathoracic structures have been described following the use of trocars to insert large- bore chest tubes. The use of a trocar to guide a chest drain insertion is associated with the highest complication rates58and,in a recent study of malpositioned chest tubes, all had been inserted by the trocar technique.86A trocar should therefore never be used. Blunt dissection of the subcutaneous tissue and muscle into the pleural cavity has therefore become universal and is essen- tial. In one retrospective study87only four technical complica- tions were seen in 447 cases using blunt dissection. Using a Spencer eWells clamp or similar, a path is made through the chest wall by opening the clamp to separate the muscle bres. For a large chest drain ( >24 F), this track should be explored with a nger through into the thoracic cavity to ensure there are no underlying organs that might then be damaged at tube insertion. This is essential in the case of thoracic trauma where displacement of internal organs may make insertion of the drain particularly hazardous. Excessive force should never be required during drain insertion. Sutures and securing the drain A common complication of drain insertion is accidental removal of the drain, usually as a result of inadequate securing techniques. The drain itself should be secured after insertion to prevent it falling out. Various techniques have been described but a simple technique of anchoring the tube has not been the subject of a controlled trial. The chosen suture should be stout and non- absorbable (eg, '0'or '1-0 'silk) to prevent breaking and it should include adequate skin and subcutaneous tissue to ensure it is secure. Commercially available dressings may also be used which x to the skin and then attach to the drain. It should be emphasised that, while these dressings are useful for stabilising the drain at the skin and preventing kinking at the skin surface, they do not replace the need to stitch the drain rmly in place. Large amounts of tape and padding to dress the site are unnecessary and concerns have been expressed that they may restrict chest wall movement or increase moisture collection. A transparent dressing allows the wound site to be inspected by nursing staff for leakage or infection. An omental tag of tape has been described which allows the tube to lie a little away from the chest wall to prevent tube kinking and tension at the insertion site ( gure 4). In the case of a large-bore drain, a suture for wound closure should be placed at the time of the drain insertion. A 'mattress ' suture or sutures across the incision are usually employed and, whatever closure is used, the stitch must be of a type that is appropriate for a linear incision. Complicated 'purse-string ' sutures must not be used as they convert a linear wound into a circular one that is painful for the patient and may leave an Figure 4 The omental close the wound is not usually required for small-gauge chest tubes. Drain position <If malposition of a chest drain is suspected a CT scan is the best method to exclude or con rm its presence. (C) <A chest drain may be withdrawn to correct a malposi- tion but should never be pushed further in due to the risk of infection. ( U) <A further drain should never be inserted through the same hole as a previously dislodged drain as this can introduce infection. ( U) If possible, the tip of the tube should be aimed apically to drain air and basally for fluid. However, successful drainage can still be achieved when the drain is not placed in an ideal position and therefore effectively functioning tubes should not be reposi- tioned simply because of a suboptimal radiographic appearance. In the case of a drain which fails despite an apparent acceptable position on the plain chest x-ray, a CT scan may be performed and demonstrate the cause. A chest tube may be intraparenchymal or extrapleural and the chest x-ray may give no indication of its malposition.5556 88 Drainage systems <A chest drain should be connected to a drainage system that contains a valve mechanism to prevent fluid or air from entering the pleural cavity. This may be an underwater seal, flutter valve or other recognised mechanism. ( U) A number of drainage systems are available. The most common is the underwater seal bottle although flutter bags and Heimlich valves have been successfully used to achieve ambulatory drainage and numerous other examples have been described. All drainage systems allow only one direction of flow. The closed underwater seal bottle is a system in which a tube is placed under water at a depth of approximately 3 cm with a side vent with allows escape of air or may be connected to a suction pump. This enables the operator to see air bubble out as the lung re-expands in the case of pneumothorax or fluid evacuation rate in empyemas, pleural effusions or haemothorax. The continuation of bubbling suggests a continued visceral pleural air leak, although it may also occur in patients on suction when the drain is partly out of the thorax and one of the tube holes is open to the air. The inspiratory swing in the tube is useful for assessing tube patency and con rms the position of the tube in the pleural cavity. The disadvantages of the underwater seal system include the obliga- tory inpatient management, dif culty of patient mobilisation and the risk of knocking the bottle over. The use of integral Heimlich flutter valves has been advocated in the case of pneumothoraces, especially as they permit ambulatory or even outpatient management which has been associated with a success rate of 85 e95%. In 176 cases of pneumothorax treated with small chest tubes and a Heimlich flutter valve there were only eight failures (hospital admissions for problems with tube function or placement).89The average length of inpatient stay has been quoted as 5 h with a thoracic vent and 144 h with an underwater seal, with a cost saving of US$5660.90Case reports of incorrect use (wrong direction of flow) of such valves have been described, however, with tension pneumothorax as a result. Flutter valves cannot be used with fluid drainage as they tend to become blocked. However, in the UK a similar short hospital stay is achieved by initial aspiration of pneumothoraces (see pneumothorax guidelines).The use of a drainage bag with an incorporated flutter valve and vented outlet has been successfully used postoperatively but has also been used successfully in clinical practice. In the case of malignant pleural effusion drainage, a closed system using a drainage bag or aspiration via a three-way tap has been described to aid palliation and outpatient management. The more recent development of indwelling tunnelled pleural cath- eters is likely to replace this. Management of a chest drain <All patients with chest drains should be cared for by a medical or surgical team experienced with their management and nursed on a ward familiar with their care. (U) Rate of fluid drainage and clamping the drain <A bubbling chest tube should never be clamped. (C) <A maximum of 1.5 l should be drained in the rst hour after insertion of the drain. (C) <Drainage of a large pleural effusion should be controlled to prevent the potential complication of re-expansion pulmonary oedema. (C) Clamping a chest drain in the presence of a continuing air leak may occasionally lead to the potentially fatal complication of a tension pneumothorax. A bubbling drain should therefore never be clamped. It is felt that a general rule not to clamp a drain is the safe approach in most instances to avoid clamping being carried out inappropriately by less experienced clinicians. However, many experienced physicians support the use of clamping of chest drains prior to their removal to detect small air leaks not immediately obvious at the bedside. By clamping the chest drain for several hours followed by a chest x-ray, a recurrence of a pneumothorax may be ruled out. Such a strategy, though not generally recommended, may be acceptable for experienced specialists. The clamped drain should be closely supervised by nursing staff who are familiar with the management of chest drains and who should unclamp the chest drain in the event of any clinical deterioration. In the case of pleural effusions, the volume of fluid drained in therst hour should be a maximum of 1.5 l. After an hour the rest of the fluid may be drained off slowly. The fluid volume should be controlled in this fashion to avoid the risk of RPO (see earlier). Suction There is no evidence to recommend or discourage the use of suction in a medical scenario, however it is common practice especially in the treatment of non-resolving pneumothoraces. In trauma and postoperative patients, suction has been shown not to improve pneumothorax resolution times or chest drain duration9192and, in some cases, may potentially be detri- mental.93 94It is dif cult, however, to extrapolate this evidence to the medical use of chest drains. One study did include patients with spontaneous pneumothorax and again found that the use of suction did not alter treatment outcome, but the number of patients was small.95 If suction is required, this may be done by the underwater seal at a level of 10 e20 cm H 2O. A high-volume low-pressure system (eg, Vernon-Thompson) is required to cope with a large leak. A low-volume high-pressure pump (eg, Roberts pump) is inap- propriate as it is unable to cope with the rapid flow, thereby effecting a situation similar to clamping and risking formation of a tension pneumothorax. A wall suction adaptor may 2):ii61 eii76. doi:10.1136/thx.2010.137026 ii71BTS connected to a speci- alised thoracic suction regulator and not directly to the high negative pressure regulators that are used for other purposes. Nursing care of a chest drain <Chest drains should be managed on wards familiar with chest drains and their management. ( U) <Drains should be checked daily for wound infection, fluid drainage volumes and documentation for swinging and/or bubbling. ( U) Patients should be managed on a ward familiar with chest tubes. The appropriate training of the nursing staff is imperative and communication between the medical and nursing staff regarding the chest drain care is vital. If an underwater seal is used, instructions must be given to keep the bottle below the insertion site at all times, to ensure that it is kept upright and that there is adequate water in the system to cover the end of the tube. Daily reassessment of the amount of drainage/bubbling and the pres- ence of respiratory swing should be documented preferably on a dedicated chest drain chart. Instructions with regard to chest drain clamping must be given and recorded. Patients should be encouraged to take responsibility for their chest tube and drainage system. They should be taught to keep the underwater seal bottle below the level of their chest and to report any problems such as pulling on the drain insertion site. Educational material (eg, lea flets) should be available on the ward for patients and nursing staff. Removal of drain The chest tube should be removed once the fluid drainage has decreased to less than 200 ml per day, resolution of the pneu- mothorax (see speci c guidelines) or when the drain is no longer functioning. Removal is with a brisk rm movement while an assistant ties the previously placed mattress suture. In a study comparing removal in inspiration or expiration with a Valsalva manoeuvre, there was no difference in the immediate or short- term rate of pneumothorax.96 In the case of pneumothorax, the drain should not usually be removed until bubbling has ceased in the presence of evidence of tube patency and chest x-ray demonstration of re-in flation. Clamping of the drain prior to removal is generally unnecessary. When considering removal of a drain under suction, in trauma patients, a period of water seal only drainage prior to removal probably reduces the rate of recurrence of signi cant pneumo- thorax after removal97although the results of a smaller study dispute this.98There are no studies to guide medical practice, although it is common practice to allow a period of water seal only drainage after suction and before the drain is removed to check that a pneumothorax does not recur off suction. THORACIC ULTRASOUND Ultrasound physics Medical ultrasound uses sound waves between 2.5 and 12 MHz generated by a transducer to interrogate tissue. The sound waves are attenuated as they travel through tissue. Some or all of these waves are re flected at the interface between tissues where a difference between tissue impedance exists. The returning waves are detected by the transducer and converted into an image. An understanding of the physical laws governing the trans- mission of sound waves in solids and fluids will facilitate an understanding of the acquired image and optimisation of the scanning technique. Fluid is an excellent conductor of sound waves and appears black on ultrasound whereas air effectivel y blocks all transmission of soundwaves and generates a random snowstorm image. Internal organs such as the liver or spleen have va riable echogenicity depending on the proportion of sound waves re flected by the structure. The maximal depth and resolution of an ultrasound image is related to the frequency of the sound waves. Lower frequencies have longer wavelengths and hence better tissue penetration but lower resolution. Higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths which provide higher resolution images and at a greater refresh rate but poor tissue penetration. Normal thoracic ultrasound appearance Ultrasound examination of the thorax is limited by air within the lungs, which is a poor conductor of sound waves, and the acoustic shadow caused by the bony structures surrounding the thorax such as the ribs and scapulae. However, the concept of an acoustic window99has allowed for effective ultrasound exami- nation of the thorax in the presence of pleural pathology such as a pleural effusion or pulmonary consolidation or tumour abut- ting the pleura. The normal thoracic ultrasound appearance is well described.100e104With the transducer held in the longitudinal plane, the ribs are visualised on ultrasound as repeating curvi- linear structures with a posterior acoustic shadow ( gure 5). The overlying muscle and fascia are represented by linear shadows of soft tissue echogenicity. The parietal and visceral pleura is usually visualised as a single echogenic line no more than 2 mm in width which 'slides 'or 'glides 'beneath the ribs with respi- ration when using a low-frequency transducer. T wo separate lines can be visualised when using a high-frequency transducer. Normal aerated lung blocks the progression of sound waves and is characterised by a haphazard snowstorm appearance caused by reverberation artefact which diminishes in intensity with distance from the transducer. Comet-tail artefacts can also be seen due to imperfections within the pleura and are best seen at the lung bases. The diaphragms are bright curvilinear structures which move up and down with respiration. The liver and spleen are readily recognised by their characteristic ultrasound appear- ance below the right and left hemidiaphragm, respectively. Abnormal thoracic ultrasound appearance Pleural effusion Ultrasound has a higher sensitivity in the detection of a pleural effusion than clinical examination or chest x-rays including a lateral decubitus lm.105The ultrasound appearance of Figure 5 Normal lung with acoustic rib shadows: A, soft tissues; B, pleura; C, rib; D, characteristics of pleural fluid echo densities, flapping or swaying 'tongue- like 'structures due to underlying compressive atelectasis of the lung and movable septae.106Depending upon its internal echogenicity and the presence of septations, a pleural effusion can be classi ed totally echo-free, complex non-septated if echogenic swirling densities are present, or complex septated if ne strands are present within the fluid (gure 6B).103 108Anechoic effusions can be either transudates or exudates, complex effusions are always exudates.103 The volume of pleural fluid can be calculated using various formulae, but these are mainly applicable to patients receiving mechanical ventilation109 110and are dif cult to apply in prac- tice to non-ventilated patients. The following alternative clas- sication has been suggested by Tsai et al111: (1) minimal if the echo-free space is within the costophrenic angle; (2) small if the echo-free space extends over the costophrenic angle but is still within a single probe range; (3) moderate if the echo-free space is between a one to two probe range; and (4) large if the space is bigger that a 2 probe range. Furthermore, a pleural effusion is usually considered too small to tap if it is <1 cm in depth.106 Pleural thickening Occasionally a minimal pleural effusion can be hard to distinguish from pleural thickening which may manifest as an anechoic or hypoechoic stripe. The presence of a chaotic linear colour band between the visceral and parietal pleura using colour Doppler has a higher sensitivity for detecting pleural fluid than grey scale ultrasound alone and this is known as the 'fluid colour sign '.112113 However, the routine application and interpretation of this is likely to be beyond the expertise of the non-radiologist. Malignant pleural effusion Thoracic ultrasound can facilitate the diagnosis of a malignant pleural effusion. The presence of pleural or diaphragmatic thickening or nodularity99114or an echogenic swirling pattern in patients with known malignancy115is highly suggestive of a malignant pleural effusion. Pulmonary consolidation Pulmonary consolidation is sonographically visible in the pres- ence of adjacent pleural effusion acting as an acoustic window or if directly abutting the pleura ( gure 7). It appears as a wedge- shaped irregular echogenic area with air or fluid broncho- grams.116 117On colour Doppler ultrasound, branching tubular structures is visible.113 Parapneumonic effusions and empyema Parapneumonic can be hyperechoic without septae and even anechoic.118Ultrasound is better than CT at demonstrating septae.118 However, CT is preferred in complex pleuroparenchymal disease as it is better at delineating the relationship between loculated pleural collections, parenchymal consolidation and the medias- tinum.119The presence of septae does not imply loculations as thefluid may still be free flowing within the hemithorax.118 In a study of 36 patients with proven parapneumonic effusion or empyema, Kearney et al did not nd any correlation between the ultrasound appearance and Light 's stages of empyema, the presence of pus or the need for surgical intervention.118In contrast, two other studies have shown that septated para- pneumonic effusions have a poorer outcome.120 121Chen et al showed that sonographically visible septations were associated with a longer hospital stay, longer chest tube drainage, higher likelihood of brinolytic therapy and surgical intervention120 and Shankar et alfound that a complex septated parapneumonic effusion had a 62.5% resolution rate with chest tube drainage compared with 81.5% with a complex non-septated para- pneumonic effusion.121 Ongoing pleural infection despite adequate antibiotic therapy is often due to suboptimal placement of the chest drain, particularly in the presence of loculations.122T wo studies have demonstrated the utility of ultrasound-guided chest drainage as the principal treatment for parapneumonic effusion or empyema with an overall success rate of 78%121and 72%.80Factors asso- ciated with failure were pneumothorax or a Pneumothorax The of a pneumothorax and hydropneumothorax can be inferred sonographically by the absence pleural 'sliding 'and the presence of reverberation artefact.123 124The utility of thoracic ultrasound for diagnosing a pneumothorax is limited in hospital practice due to the ready availability of chest x-rays and conflicting data from published reports. In a study of 53 patients following a transbronchial biopsy or chest drain removal, thoracic ultrasound using a high-frequency transducer and apical scans had a sensitivity and speci city of 100% for the detection of post- procedure pneumothorax compared with a chest x-ray or CTscan of the thorax.124An earlier report comparing ultrasound with CT scanning showed a lesser sensitivity following lung biopsy,125and a recently published report suggested that ultrasound was less sensitive and speci c in patients with emphysema.126 Thoracic ultrasound technique The technique for thoracic ultrasound is well described in several review articles102 104 111and by Koh et al in an online review article containing images and videos.127The patient should be positioned either in the sitting or lateral decubitus position if critically ill. The chest x-ray should be reviewed before the ultrasound examination. Figure 6 Pleural effusions. (A) within be reduced to maximise screen contrast. In general, a 3.5 e5 MHz sector transducer provides good views of intrathoracic and upper abdominal structures including pleural fluid. A 5e10 MHz linear transducer should be selected for detailed examination of the pleura. Acoustic gel should be applied between the transducer and the area to be examined. The transducer should be held like a pen, applying rm pressure upon the skin to maximise acoustic coupling while resting the medial aspect of the palm upon the chest. The image should be optimised by adjusting the depth, gain and focus. The depth should be adjusted until the area of interest lls the entire screen, while the gain should be increased or decreased to maximise the contrast between different tissues. Examination should commence with the transducer placed within an interspace on the posterior chest wall on the side of interest. The transducer should be moved obliquely along the interspace (avoiding the acoustic shadow cause by re flection of the ultrasound by the ribs) in both the transverse and longitu- dinal planes, thereby minimising interference from the acoustic shadow from the ribs. It is imperative that the diaphragm is unequivocally identi ed before any invasive procedure to avoid inadvertent intra-abdominal penetration. The thorax should be examined posteriorly, laterally and anteriorly, particularly when a loculated pleural effusion suspected. The thorax should be examined using grey-scale real-time ultrasound, paying particularly attention to location, sono- graphic appearance and echogenicity.111The echogenicity of a lesion is de ned relative to the liver which, by de nition, is isoechoic. The contralateral thorax can be used as a control except where there is bilateral pleural pathology. Ultrasound-guided pleural aspiration and chest drain insertion The identi cation of a site for pleural aspiration using physical examination can be straightforward in the presence of a large free-flowing pleural effusion, but image guidance is recom- mended for all procedures as discussed above. When using ultrasound to select a site for aspiration of a pleural effusion, the site chosen should have (1) suf cient depth of pleural fluid (at least 10 mm), (2) no intervening lung at maximal inspiration and (3) minimal risk of puncture of other structures such as the heart, liver and spleen. It should be noted that ultrasound will not prevent inadvertent laceration of the intercostal neuro- vascular bundle, particularly where they run within the inter- costal space medial to the angle of the rib.24 Once a site has been localised, it should be marked either with an indentation or indelible ink and a mental note made of themaximal depth of fluid present and the required angulation of needle insertion. It is preferable to perform the aspiration at the time of the ultrasound rather mark a spot for subsequent aspi- ration20as any alteration of the patient 's position may signi - cantly alter the relationship between the skin marker and the underlying pleural fluid.20 21 102Real-time guidance using a free- hand approach may be necessary in small or loculated pleural effusions. The technique of ultrasound-guided chest drain insertion is similar to that for pleural aspiration. The main purpose of ultrasound is to identify a safe site for aspiration of fluid followed by insertion of the chest drain. The procedure is rarely performed under real-time guidance. Pleural procedures within the critical care setting <Ultrasound guidance reduces the complications associ- ated with pleural procedures in the critical care setting and its routine use is recommended. (C) Thoracic ultrasound within the critical care setting is especially useful due to the portability of the equipment when treating and diagnosing relatively immobile patients. Erect and, less commonly, decubitus chest x-rays are frequently used to diag- nose pleural effusions. However, these views are rarely possible in critically ill patients. Diagnosis of pleural effusions on supine lms is much more challenging and frequently inaccurate.128 The use of bedside ultrasound by appropriately trained inten- sivists has been shown to safely identify and guide aspiration of pleural effusions in mechanically ventilated patients.129Of the 44 effusions that were aspirated during this study, the pleural effusion was not evident on a supine chest x-ray in 17 cases. Ultrasound guidance is strongly recommended in this setting, not only because the diagnosis of pleural effusions is more difcult but also because the consequence of complications is often more serious. With ultrasound-guided procedures the complication rate is similar to procedures undertaken in other settings.101 102 Thoracic ultrasound training <At least level 1 competency is required to safely perform independent thoracic ultrasound. ( U) Thoracic ultrasound is a very operator-dependent procedure where imaging acquisition and interpretation are carried out simultaneously. There is little evidence to specify the length of training required for a non-radiologist to become competent in basic thoracic ultrasound.130In the UK the Royal College of Radiologists has published guidelines establishing the minimum standards required to achieve basic or level 1 competency in thoracic ultrasound.131Although the guideline de nes a minimum number of supervised procedures, it should be recognised that some individuals may require more supervision to achieve competency in thoracic ultrasound. An additional 100 scans to achieve level 2 standard or 2 years further experience at level 1 standard would allow the individual to train others to level 1 thoracic ultrasound standard. In practice, more scans are required beyond level 1 compe- tency to achieve a reasonable level of expertise in thoracic ultrasound, particularly where there is loculated pleural fluid. It is advisable for the novice to start with patients with simple free-flowing pleural effusions before moving on to patients with complex pleural or pleuroparenchymal disease.102The images should be correlated with the CT scan of the thorax or advice should be sought from a radiologist if the individual is unable to interpret the acquired images.
