But experts say there's one immunization you shouldn't forget to book as fall approaches: your flu shot. It's important to get the flu vaccine every year, but it should be an even higher priority for the 2022-2023 flu season, [Thomas Russo, MD](https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=trusso), an infectious disease expert at the University of Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, tells SELF. That's because data from Australia's flu season, which starts to wane just as flu season ramps up in the US, is raising some concerns among infectious disease experts. \"We look at Australia to predict our flu season. And this year, they had a [horrific flu season](https://www1.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/ozflu-surveil-no11-22.htm),\" [Kenneth Koncilja, MD](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/21239-kenneth-koncilja), an internal medicine and geriatrics specialist at Cleveland Clinic, tells SELF. \"The season peaked two months earlier than normal and with worse intensity.\" Last season's lower numbers, both in Australia and in the US, are likely a success story of all the COVID precautions we took, like [masking](https://www.self.com/story/best-n95-face-masks) and social distancing, which are measures that help protect against any respiratory illness, including cold and flu, Dr. Russo says. But as COVID restrictions were lifted globally, influenza once again reared its ugly head. \"People are traveling, interacting without masks,\" Dr. Russo points out. That's why experts fear a rise in cases may also unfold in the US this year. So this isn't the time to pass on your flu vaccine\u2014especially if you face a higher risk of severe illness (or plan on visiting someone who is vulnerable, like your grandparents or a pregnant friend, as you enjoy the holidays). But when should you get your flu shot, anyway? Here's what you need to know, including when flu season begins and the best time to schedule your appointment. When does flu season start and how long does it typically last? Influenza viruses are detected year-round, but cases tend to spike during the fall and winter months in the US. The exact timing of flu season varies from year to year, per the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention ( [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/season/flu-season.htm)), but flu activity (read: when the germs start spreading) usually starts to increase in October and peaks sometime between December and February. That said, \"significant activity\" may still be recorded as late as May. When should you get your flu shot? The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2022-2023.htm) recommends the flu shot for everyone six months or older; you can get vaccinated as early as September, and you ideally shouldn't wait past October, per the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/season/faq-flu-season-2022-2023.htm). There's a reason you're supposed to get your vaccine before flu season is in full swing; \"It takes a couple of weeks [for the vaccine] to kick in,\" Dr. Russo says. That means your body generally needs about [two weeks to develop flu-fighting antibodies](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/keyfacts.htm) after your vaccination\u2014so you're not protected right after your appointment. If you aren't able to get your flu shot during September or October, it's still worth getting vaccinated later in the season, since flu cases are reported well into spring, Dr. Russo says. Can you get your flu shot and your COVID-19 vaccine or booster at the same time? If you want to make the most of a trip to the pharmacy, [there's no reason you can't get both shots at the same time](https://www.self.com/story/flu-covid-19-vaccine-same-time) (in different arms), Dr. Russo says. As with most vaccines, you may experience certain [side effects after you get the flu shot](https://www.self.com/story/flu-vaccine-side-effects). These can include low-grade fever, headache, muscle aches, nausea, and fatigue, as well as redness, soreness, or swelling at the injection site. Similar side effects can occur after the COVID-19 vaccine, according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html). Feeling a bit crummy post-jab is a totally normal response and typically means your body is doing its job by reacting to the vaccine. You should feel generally better in a few days, so don't sweat it too much. Of course, if you rather not deal with two achy arms at once, there's no harm in spacing out your vaccines by a week or two either, Dr. Russo says. If you have a high risk of severe COVID and flu, ask your health care provider when it's best to get vaccinated\u2014they may recommend prioritizing one vaccine over the other, depending on your personal health history. Where can you get your flu vaccine? In addition to doctors' offices, community health clinics, and urgent care centers, you can also get your flu vaccine at most pharmacies and even many grocery stores, including chains like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Target, and Publix. Some pharmacies only give the flu shot for free if you have health insurance, though. You may also have to get your vaccine at a certain location, such as a primary care provider's office, in order for your insurance company to cover it. So it's worth calling ahead of your appointment to make sure you won't be charged. (Without insurance, a flu shot can cost anywhere from $20 to $75, depending on where you go.) It's also worth checking in with your employer. Some companies offer flu shots for free as a benefits perk, Dr. Koncilja says. [Student health centers](https://www.self.com/story/take-advantage-of-student-health-center) also typically offer free flu shots to college students. The CDC's [vaccine finder tool](https://www.vaccines.gov/find-vaccines/) can help you find the nearest place to book an appointment in your area. And if you don't have insurance, you can always try contacting your [local health department](https://www.naccho.org/membership/lhd-directory), Dr. Russo suggests. Experts in your community may be able to recommend clinics that provide the vaccine to everyone for free, regardless of insurance "}
