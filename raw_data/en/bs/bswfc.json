In 2021, the State of Maryland was allocated $3.7 billion by the Federal Government for American Rescue Plan, State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF). This SLFRF Annual Performance Report describes project performance, highlighting the: Speed that SLFRF were allocated to meet urgent needs during the pandemic emergency. Rate of spending (expenditures) demonstrating SLFRF were distributed quickly to jumpstart the recovery and the progress made over the past two years. Equitable use of SLFRF to support disadvantaged and underserved Marylanders, small businesses and nonprofits, education, and industries hit hardest by the pandemic. This report details expenditures from March 3, 2021 through June 30, 2023, and includes planned allocations for state fiscal year 202 4 (July 1, 2023 through June 30, 2024). In Maryland, SLFRF funds 28 projects, including 97 subprojects. This report includes data collection and project monitoring efforts to ensure the efficient, eff ective, and equitable use of SLFRF. Exhibit 1 summarizes Maryland's allocation of SLFRF by expenditure group. To-date, Maryland has spent $ 3.14 billion (85%) of the $3.71 billion the state was allocated. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 8 State of Maryland Maryland's Funding Allocation Process When the American Rescue Plan (ARP) became law on March 11, 2021, the Office of the Governor and the General Assembly moved quickly to reach a bipartisan spending plan for State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF). Supplemental Budget #5 was introduced by the governor on March 31, 2021 reflecting appropriations for many of the agreed-upon items. The Office of the Governor and the General Assembly were confident the spending plan would: Support urgent COVID- 19 response efforts to decrease the spread of the virus Support immediate economic stabilization for households and businesses Address public health and economic challenges that have contributed to the unequal impact of the pandemic on certain populations Replace lost public sector revenue to strengthen support for vital public services and to help retain jobs The U.S. Treasury's Final Rule establishes that American Rescue Plan, State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) can be utilized for: Public health responses for those impacted by the pandemic, including the general public Responses to the negative economic impacts that were experienced as a result of the pandemic Additional services, either as a public health response or a response to the negative economic impacts of the pandemic, for disproportionately impacted communities. Prior to the federal American Rescue Plan (ARP), the Office of the Governor championed the RELIEF Act of 2021, which was enacted by the Maryland General Assembly as an emergency bill and signed into l aw on February 15, 2021. Implemented as 'Recovery Now' projects, the state leveraged SLFRF for many of the projects, and excluded any items in the original agreement that are not eligible based on the Final Rule. Recovery Now projects are labeled in the Project Inventory section of this report. Many of the Recovery Now projects were completed in 2021, demonstrating the speed of implementation, timely distribution of funds, and equitable support to Marylanders and organizations in-need. In total, Maryland has been allocated $ 18.6 billion from the American Rescue Plan , including awards to the state, local governments, individuals directly, schools, hospitals, nonprofits, and others. For example , $6.5 billion in Economic Impact Payments dir ect to individuals and $248 million for the Homeowner Assistance Fund (HAF) to households through the Department of Housing and Community Development. Similarly, federal funds for vaccinations, $2.8 billion for education, and other federal funds may fall outside of SLFRF. This report focuses on the $3.7 billion allocated for SLFRF. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 9 State of Maryland Key Outcome Goals Since 1999, Managing for Results has been the state's strategic planning, performance measurement, and performance informed budgeting program. Each agency / unit of government is responsible for establishing written strategies and objectives, and then creating outcome and output measures that align to those strategies and to the Administration's priorities. Many of the performance measures in the Managing for Results program are required as part of legislative reporting. In total, the state reports on approximately 4,000 performance measures annually. This established performance measurement process helped Maryland to identify the following key outcome goals for SLFRF: Improvement in health outcomes by addressing inequity in health care access and quality Reduced cancer and heart disease mortality rates Reduced infant mortality, with a focus on reducin g the gap between infant mortality rates for African Americans and other races Improving the percentage of births with first trimester care Reduction in poverty, food insecurity, and utility debt Increase in the number of local workforce development board clients placed in employment Decrease in the percentage of families and people whose income in the last 12 months was below the poverty level Decrease in the prevalence of households with very low food security Reduction in statewide utility bill arrearag es Improved educational outcomes through school infrastructure improvement, broadband access expansion, and programs to address pandemic learning loss Increase in the four-year high school graduation rate Increase in the number of households with access to broadband internet services Stabilization and growth of Maryland's economy through support to small businesses and industries most negatively impacted by the pandemic Comparison of Maryland's unemployment rate to the national average Increase in Maryland's Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Increase in state sales tax revenue attributable to tourism 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 10 State of Maryland Use of Funds Maryland allocated SLFRF to 28 projects.

In comparison, the economic recovery following the 2008 recession took more than 5 years to reach the level of recovery shown by a year and a half from the end of the pan demic recession. Read more about Maryland's economic recovery in the Reducing Negative Economic Impacts section. Electric and gas utilities, as a result of increased arrearages (late bills), were allocated $83,000,000 in SLFRF. 155,875 Maryland households in-need received support. The 2021 Maryland Public Service Commission Annual Report described statewide arrearages dropped back to pre- pandemic levels for most utilities . The number of individuals participating in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program increased from approximately 25,000 pre-pandemic to a high of over 57,000 during the state of emergency. T he state used SLFRF to help support these individuals and families. As of March 2023, core bus ridership was at 82% of pre- pandemic levels, a substantial increase from the low of 47% in the summer of 2020 . SLFRF supported enhancement s to core bus service. These enhancements reflect the Administration's commitment to prioritize equitable access and service reliability as ridership rebound s. SLFRF helped to serve more than 7,600 Marylanders through the state's Local Workforce Development Boards in t he area of sectoral job training: skilling, credentialing, and identifying job opportunities for workers affected by the pandemic. Pandemic related unemployment claims depleted the Unemployment Insurance (UI) Trust Fund. As of September 27, 2021, Maryland paid off its federal UI loan balance with SLFRF as allowed under the U.S. Treasury's Final Rule and Senate Bill SB 811. This action avoided the federal unemployment insurance tax credit reduction in 2022, replenishing the UI Trust Fund with $830 million. High -speed internet access is essential for online education, telemedicine, and overall access to digital society. In 2022, Connect Maryland was launched. It is a transformative initiative to supercharge the state's broadband investment with $400 million to fully address the digital divide. In addition to SLFRF, the state has been awarded $162 million in Coronavirus Capital Projects Funds. The funds are accounted for in the FY 2023 -2027 Capital Improvement Program. In July 2023, Governor Moore announced Maryland ActNow, a public awareness campaign to help increase enro llment in discounted internet access for low -income households. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 18 State of Maryland Community Engagement and Promoting Equitable Outcomes Outcome: Community Engagement to Eliminate Poverty and Provide Better Access to Telemedicine for Disadvantaged Populations The Department of Housing and Community Development, Office of Statewide Broadband has teamed up with the University of Maryland Extension on the SLFRF Broadband Services project ($84,000,000) to deliver computer devices, broadband service, and digital literacy training to disadvantaged Marylanders. For example, senior adults, low income, language barrier (low literacy or English learner), members of a racial or ethnic minority group, people with disabilities, people from immigrant communities, rural communitie s, and Baltimore City . Over 90,000 devices were requested in FY23. The project also created the Digital Literacy Partnerships Network, described further in the project inventory section of this report, under project 2i - Broadband Services. Outcome: Improve Equitable Outcomes in Public Health Health Equity Resources Communities (HERCs) are using SLFRF to lay the foundation for improved health equity. The HERC Consumer Outreach and Community Engagement Subcommittee in the Department of Health hosted fourteen meetings across the state to inform communities and potential applicants about the Pathways to Health Equity request for proposals . Nine grant awards were made in FY22 totaling $13.5 million. A ll projects are underway. H ealth disparities targeted by the new projects include diabetes, asthma, heart disease and hypertension, mental health, substance use disorder, maternal and child health, and Sickle Cell Disease. Learn more about the Pathways to Health Equity program in the project inventory section of the report, under project 2N.3 - Health Equity Resources Communities. Outcome: Crime Prevention and Community Safety to Improve Quality of Life The Community Safety Works program is utilizing $10 million in SLFRF to impr ove the livability and economic potential of Maryland communities through targeted investments in crime prevention that impact community safety. Community engagement meetings were conducted with leaders from designated Main Street Maryland communities and the Baltimore Regional Neighborhoods (BRNI) collaborative, regional partnerships with approved strategic neighborhood revitalization plans. Technical assistance was provided on how to apply for the program and f eedback was incorporated into the program design. Grants were awarded to 156 non- profit and tax -exempt organizations to support facility and community improvements, business d istrict and neighborhood s afety , crime and violence intervention and prevention.

This work is achieved by promoting healthy lifestyles, researching disease and injury prevention, and detecting, preventing, and responding to infectious diseases. Overall, public health is concerned with protecting the health of entire populations. These populations can be as small as a local neighborhood, or as big as an entire country or region of the world. 1 What is Health Equity? Health equity exists when all people, regardless of race, sex, sexual orientation, disability, socio -economic status, geographic location, or other societal constructs have fair and just access, opportunity, and resources to achieve their highest potential for health. 2 Since 2004, the Maryland Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities (OMHHD) has a mission to address social determinants of health and eliminate health disparities by leveraging the Department's resources, providing health equity consultation, impacting external communications, guiding policy designs, and influencing strategic direction on behalf of the Secretary of Health. The Office's vision is to achieve health equity where all individuals and communities have the opportunity and access to achieve and maintain good health. The Maryland Community Health Resources Commission (CHRC) was created by the Maryland General Assembly in 2005 to expand access to health care services in underserved communities. In 2021, the Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities (OMHHD), the Maryland Department of Health (MDH), and the Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) focused efforts to improve data collection, analysis, and reporting of health disparities. State laws were updated to include additional requirements for collaboration, establishment of an inventory of health disparities and a clearinghouse / database to manage them, and enhancement of the frequency and detail of health disparities reporting in the executive branch and to the legislature. The state established the Maryland Commission on Health Equity through the Shirley Nathan- Pulliam Health Equity Act of 2021. The Commission will establish a comprehensive plan for the elimination of minority health disparities. An initial annual report was provided in December 2021 titled House Bill (HB) 309 / Senate Bill (SB) 565: Health Disparities Legislative Report, and a 2022 Annual Report . 1 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; CDC Foundation; Website link -https://www.cdcfoundation.org/ 2 Health Equity Leadership & Exchange Network, 2020; Retrie ved from - https://healthequitytracker.org/whatishealthequity 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 21 State of Maryland Innovations in Health Care and Human Services Maryland is an innovative leader in public health with the state's \" Total Cost of Care \" (TCOC) payment program and the state's cross-agency gateway to Health and Human Services, MD THINK. Unique among American states, Maryland requires that hospitals receive the same payment for specific treatments delivered to Medicare, Medicaid, commercially insured, or self -pay patients under a global budget covering all hospital and non-hospital costs. Over the five -year period 2015 through 2019, Maryland's standardized per- capita Medicare spend declined from 1 percent above the national average to 1 percent below, with improvement in many quality metrics. Global budgets create powerful incentives for ho spitals not to overtreat. In a recent report by Fair Health 3, among all 50 states Maryland had the lowest average costs for complex COVID -19 hospitalizations. At $49,127, Maryland's cost was just under half the national average of $98,139 and over $20,00 less than the next lowest -cost state (Arkansas). 4 Maryland's payment system also helped mitigate the financial impact of COVID -19 on hospitals. During the early months of the pandemic's economic lockdown, when hospital revenue plunged nationwide due to a sharp falloff in visits and elective procedures, Maryland's hospitals experienced inpatient and outpatient revenue declines of just 1.6 percent and 15 percent, respectivel y.\" 5 This moderation of revenue flows occurred because Maryland's Health Services Cost Review Commission granted hospitals the latitude to temporarily raise prices to make up for volume shortfalls. As operations normalized, hospitals lowered prices to keep their overall spending within global budget parameters. An analysis of the first two years of the TCOC program found some significant improvements particularly in the areas of care management, access, and continuity. In the first performance year of Maryland's TCOC model, the state reduced spending by $365 million, relative to national trends, according to a Mathematica implementation report. Maryland's Total Human -services Integrated Network (MD THINK) is a cross -agency solution that enables Marylanders to apply for and manage integrated health and human services. Modern technology provides for a great user experience, and case worker intelligent analytics helps to identify government pr ograms and services that people are in -need to receive. For example, a family on Medicaid and receiving Temporary Assistance for a Disability may also trigger an alert for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance and other emergency social services. The state utilized MD THINK to help get SLFRF to Marylanders in -need, especially to disproportionately impacted populations. 3 COVID -19 Treatment and Hospitalization Costs; A FAIR Health Brief; 12/15/21 4 Meaningful Value -Based Payment Reform, Part 1: Maryland Leads The Way; Emanuel, Ezekiel J.; Johnson, David ; 2/9/2022 5 Hospital Revenue Under Maryland' s Total Cost of Care Model During the COVID- 19 Pandemic, March- July 2020; American Medical Associat ion website. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 22 State of Maryland Improving Public Health Outcome Measures COVID- 19 Statistics COVID- 19 Deat hs, Hospitalizations, and Vaccinations The Maryland Department of Health (MDH) refreshes COVID -19 statistics on its website: https://coronavirus.maryland.gov/ .

The project helped ensure all current mobile crisis, stand -alone walk -in crisis, and other mental health crisis services p roviders c ould continue essential services. Background Pre-pandemic statistics: One in five adults experiences a mental health condition every year and one in seventeen lives with a serious mental illness. Adults in the United States living with serious mental illness die on average 25 years earlier than others, largely because of treatable medical conditions. 50% of those with mental illness experience its effects by age 14 and 75% by age 24, making early engagement and support critical for effective intervention. There is a well-documented link between substance use and mental health disorders as approximately 7.9 million adults in the United States have co -occurring disorders. In January 2019, Maryland created a Commission to Study Mental and Behaviora l Hea lth. The commission was tasked with studying access to mental health services and the link between mental health issues and substance use disorders. The commission included representatives from the Department of Health, Public Safety and Correctional Services, and Human Services, as well 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 28 State of Maryland as the Maryland State Police, the Maryland Insurance Administration, the Opioid Operational Command Center, and six members of the public with experience related to mental health. The COVID -19 pandemic has increased prior concerns about mental health. Survey data suggests that economic anxiety, feelings of loneliness, and depressive disorder are on the rise\u2014four in ten American adults now report feelings of anxiety or depression, up from just one in ten prior to the pandemic. 7 In addition, these effects have been disproportionately felt by essential workers, who are more likely to report feelings of anxiety, depression, and substance use as well as represent communities of color. 8 A Kaiser Family Foundation report from February 2021 noted that one in five essential workers recently reported that they have \"seriously considered suicide in the last 30 days,\" compared to eight percent of nonessential workers. In addition, 25 percent of essential workers report that they have increased use of or started use of substances to cope with stress, compared with 11 percent of non- essential workers. 9 Nearly 50 percent of individuals of color in recent surveys reported feeling depressed. This may be attributed to the fact that members of these communities have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, are more likely to be essential workers, and have historically had more difficulty in accessing behavioral health care. Project Activities Uses support ed the increased dem and for behavioral health services due to the pandemic through an accelerated cost of living provider rate; increase to cover additional personnel costs, supplies and other expenses; and revenue shortfalls. With a community -based crisis intervention approach, mobile crisis teams assess individuals in the community where they are experiencing a behavioral health emergency and de- escalate the situation on site and/or triage to appropriate services or a different setting. This enables the state to deploy appr opriate medical professionals to situations where previously law enforcement would have been the only option available. 10 These services also promote cost effectiveness, and there is evidence that they reduce unnecessary emergency department visits and hospitalizations. 11 7 Kaiser Family Foundation.

Remaining funds were awarded in FY22. Community Engagement The Commission's Crisis Services Subcommittee (CSS) was formed to identify gaps in Maryland's crisis response system and to make recommendations on addressing these gaps. The CSS was charged with studying how the statewide crisis system operates in order t o identify opportunities for creating a more comprehensive system of care. In February 2021, the Behavioral Health Administration (BHA), in partnership with the Opioid Operational Command Center (OOCC), created the Maryland Crisis System Workgroup (MCSW) to help Maryland establish an integrated, comprehensive crisis response system. This workgroup, composed of 75 diverse stakeholders from around Maryland, included representatives from state and local government, providers, advocates, and people with lived experience. MCSW met five times during 2021. Five workgroups were established as part of the MCSW: Data Dashboard; Best Practices/Standardization; Financing Sustainability; Children/Adolescents/Young Adults; and 988 Integration. Intended Outcomes The SAMHSA National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care describe three core components of a robust crisis system as follows: (1) a 24/7 clinically staffed call center that can serve as the hub of an integrated mental health crisis system; (2) mobile c risis response teams that can respond rather than law enforcement, and (3) crisis receiving and stabilization facilities that provide short -term services and can be accessed readily rather than relying on emergency departments or hospital environments. 12 Use of Evidence The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has long recognized the importance of providing access to qualified professionals who can respond in real- time to mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) crises. Community -based mobile crisis intervention services were first developed in the 1970s and have become a key element of an effective behavioral health crisis continuum of care. The main objectives of community -based mobile crisis intervention services are to provide rapid response, individual assessment, and crisis resolution by trained mental health and substance use treatment professionals and paraprofessionals in emergency situations that involve individuals who are presumed or known to have a mental health condition or SUD. With the provision of these intervention services, individuals can be linked to additional services immediately. 12 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA); retrieved https://www.samhsa.gov/ 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 30 State of Maryland In FY23, Maryland launched a new way to connect to local behavioral health and crisis services. Calling 988 will connect callers directly to the National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline which encompasses all behavioral crisis services, to include mental health and substance use (problems with drug and alcohol use).

The project also supported restorative justice through the Home A ddress C onfidentiality Program and for housing services to victims of violence. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 32 State of Maryland 1C.1 -VOCA Community Services Coordinators ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 1C.1 VOCA Community Service Coordinators $107,600 $107,600 Completed The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) has historically received funding from the VOCA grant to support the salaries of four (4) Victim Services Coordinators. Victims Services Coordinators are contractual employees hired to respond to telephone inquiries from crime victims and parole and probation agents regarding court ordered restitution and domestic violence services. Prior to the pandemic, the employees funded by this grant would also accompany victims to court for protective order hearings, arrange for emergency services for victims of domestic violence, and other public health services. SLFRF helped support the short- term needs for the coordinators. Use of Evidence Restor ative justice is not only an aspect of public health, it also plays an important role in economic mobility. Results For America's Economic Mobility Catalog 13 describes the correlation between community- based victim services for restorative justice and econ omic mobility. Victim Services Coordinators provide support and safe communities that help family stability by providing timely information to victims and their family members following an act of violence. Having access to a Victim Services Coordinator to provide information about the courts and the offender at each stage in the justice process plays a valuable role in restoration for the victim and their family : from the crime scene, to investigation, trial / sentencing, the offender is housed at a state correctional facility, offender parole hearing, eligibility, and release date, offender on community supervision, sex offender registry. For example, a victim contacting the Victim Services Coordinator to learn about a convicted offender's status, relay concerns about inappropriate contact by the offender, and to request mediated dialog. A victim can also contact the Victim Service Coordinator to learn about an offender's parole eligibility, upcoming hearings, and exercise the victim's right to be present. SLFRF helped to continue their work without disruption during the pandemic. 13 Justice and Public Safety S trategies to Strengthen Communities; Results For Report 33 State of Maryland 1C.2 -VOCA New Future Bridges Subsidy ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 1C.2 VOCA New Futures Bridges Subsidy $2,000,000 $1,034,300 More Than 50% Complete The New Futures Bridge Subsidy (NFBS) Program is a short- term rental subsidy program available to survivors of domestic and/or intimate partner violence, sexual assault, or sex trafficking, and youth aging out of foster care who have been victims of neglect and/or abuse. The NFBS Program works with victim service providers to assist in the stabilization of program participants into safe, decent, and affordable housing as they navigate towards restoration. A housing navigator is assigned to each program participant. The housing navigators work with participants on setting goals, provide assistance with locating housing, address barriers to housing and identify financial resources. The housing navigator also acts as a liaison between the program participant an d the owner and/or property manager. Participants of the NFBS Program receive a monthly rental subsidy, paid directly to their landlord. Participants are also assisted with security deposits as we know that these lump sum payments are often a barrier to o btaining housing or relocating to a safe location. All participants are eligible to receive up to $500 in utility assistance, as large utility balances have also been identified as a barrier to obtaining and maintaining housing. The New Futures Bridge Subsidy Program provides direct outreach to victim services providers throughout the State of Maryland. The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) and victim service providers enter a memorandum of understanding (MOU) that clarifies the roles and responsibilities of each party to ensure that program participants are receiving services to address their individual needs. Timeline Each program participant is eligible for twelve months of rental assistance. COVID -19 has exacerbated and caused several delays in participants' ability to transition to self -sufficiency. The lack of affordable housing and inflation have created additional barriers in participants obtaining goals set early on. Households have been offered an additional twelve months of assistance. This will allow additional time to work towards goals set for program participants. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners The NFBS Program currently has eight victim service provider agencies under MOU. These provider agencies conduct screening of eligible applicants and submit electronic applications to the NFBS Program. Housing navigators conduct virtual or telephone inte rviews with applicants. During the initial meeting, program applicants and their case manager are informed about the program guidelines and applicant income and household information is collected. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 34 State of Maryland Background checks are conducted on program participants. O nce an applicant is determined to be eligible for the program, the housing navigator works with the participant to set goals and begin the search for housing that is appropriate for the family. The housing navigator works with the landlord to execute the h ousing contract and to ensure that the unit is inspected prior to the family moving in. Housing navigators conduct 30, 60, and 90-day meetings with the participant to ensure a smooth transition into the housing unit. The housing navigator also works with the participant to address progress made with goals. Intended Outcomes The NFBS Program's primary goal is to ensure that victims of crime have access to safe, decent, and affordable housing as they navigate towards restoration. Many successful program participants have exited the program to long- term housing options. Use of Evidence The NFBS Program was a program designed under the Victims of Crime Act. This program has been successful in transitioning over 400 victims into the rental housing market, while ensuring that the services needed are in place. This program has not been evaluated. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 35 State of Maryland 1C.3 -Safe at Home Address Confidentiality Program ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 1C.3 VOCA Safe at Home Address Confidentiality Program $361,728 $361,728 Completed The Maryland Safe at Home Address Confidentiality Program (ACP) is administered by the Office of the Secretary of State and provides an important service to victims of domestic violence and human trafficking. The goal of the ACP is to help those individuals, who have relocated or are about to relocate, to keep their perpetrators from finding them. Victim services professionals work with program participants to safely enroll. SLFRF helped to ensure continuity of the program during the pandemic. The program has two components: First, the ACP provides a substitute address for victims who have moved or are about to move to a new location unknown to their abuser. Second, the ACP provides participants with a free confidential mail -forwarding service for first- class mail and legal papers. Address confidentiality programs protect victims of domestic violence, human trafficking, stalking, and sexual assault by providing the victim with a substitute address to use as their legal residential, school, or work address to prevent abusers and traf fickers from locating their victims. Address confidentiality programs exist in most states. With the passage of Senate Bill 25 and House Bill 1056 during the 2006 legislative session, Maryland became the twentieth state to adopt an address confidentiality program. In 2014, the Maryland General Assembly passed Senate Bill 818 and House Bill 559 which expanded the program to victims of human trafficking. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 36 State of Maryland 1C.4 -VOCA Victim Services ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 1C.4 VOCA Victim Services $3,266,500 $2,263,618 More Than 50% Complete The Governor's Office of Crime Prevention, Youth, and Victim Services is using SLFRF to provide funding to the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) program. The VOC A program works to improve the treatment of victims of crime by providing them with the assistance necessary to aid their restoration after criminal violence and support as they move through the justice process. Program participants are eligible for reimbursement for medical care resulting from alleged rape , sexual assault, or child sexual abuse , as avail able, through the Sexual Assault Reimbursement Unit. Funds are also used for Crisis Intervention Teams (CIT) to implement the crisis intervention model p rogram, and to expand evidence- based practices for regional navigators to comply with the Child Sex Trafficking Screening and Services Act of 2019. Of the twenty -four jurisdiction s, ten were added to the program in FY23, leaving just four without coverage. Timeline The Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) for regional navigators was issued with a deadline of proposals due July 29, 2022. The timeline will vary for these three separate projects. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners Level of access for regional navigators are offered by eligible entities such as designated Child Advocacy Centers (CACS), rape c risis centers , and other community-based nonprofit organizations. R eimbursement claims are made confidential.

Funds were used to support AMDC operations in areas such as staffing expansions, procurement of supplies, and COVID- 19 testing and therapeutics, as well as general operational expenses to continue providing health, social, and related support services to functionally dis abled adults, ages 16 and older. The intent of this funding was to ensure that functionally disabled adults in the state continue to receive critical and necessary services and receive such services in a safe environment during the COVID- 19 pandemic. All AMDCs in the state (Medicaid or non -Medicaid enrolled) were able to submit a letter of intent and participate in this opportunity if they met the eligibility criteria. Grants were awarded to 99 AMDC providers in the state. These AMDCs were to use the fun ds to stay operational during the COVID- 19 pandemic. The awards were distributed based on license capacity of the AMDCs. MDH partnered internally with the Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ) and externally with the Maryland Association of Adult Day Servic es (MAADS) to identify the organizations and to verify licensing information. Grant funds are able to be used from the date of receipt (March 11, 2022 in most cases) through December 31, 2022. Based on the grant agreement, there are no additional perform ance requirements imposed on the AMDCs to report to MDH. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 39 State of Maryland 1D.2 -Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Upgrades for Public School Buildings ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 1D.2 Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Upgrades for Public School Buildings $80,000,000 $215,300 Less Than 50% Complete This subproject provides funding for heating, ventilation, and air conditioning upgrades for public school buildings to be allocated among school systems using the same criteria as the State of Maryland's Healthy School Facility Fund (HSFF) . This includes projects that will improve the conditions related to air conditioning, heating, indoor air quality, and temperature regulation. Spending is slower beca use the state reimburses Local Education Agencies following completion of the projects. The purpose of the Healthy School Facility Fund is to provide grants to public primary and secondary schools for capital projects that will improve the health of schoo l facilities. This includes projects that will improve the conditions related to air conditioning, heating, indoor air quality, mold remediation (including pipe insulation to prevent condensation causing mold), temperature regulation, and plumbing (including the presence of lead in drinking water outlets in school buildings). Replacements and repairs to roofs and windows are also eligible for project funding. Grants will be prioritized to projects that correct issues posing an immediate life, safety, or hea lth threat to occupants of a facility. Grants will be administered by the Interagency Commission on School Construction (IAC). The mission of the Interagency Commission on School Construction is to achieve a safe, healthy, and educationally sufficient learning environment for every child attending a public school in Maryland. The IAC's vision is a fiscally sustainable statewide portfolio of K -12 school facilities that will remain educationally sufficient for current and future generations of students and teachers. By serving as a resource for best practices and as a statewide expert in facilities operations and management, the Commission supports Local Education Agencies of every size and in every unique situation, to meet the facilities needs of approximately 1,400 school facilities that serve close t o 900,000 students in Maryland. Project Activities The project will be implemented in accordance with Education Article \u00a75 -322, Annotated Code of Maryland, which requires the Interagency Commission on School Construction (IAC) to administer the HSFF, approve expenditures, and develop administrative procedures for the grant program. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 40 - - - -State of Maryland The Administrative Procedures Guide (APG) provides all the details regarding implementation and administration of the program. A revised HSFF APG was adopted by the IAC at its meeting on August 12, 2021.

The goal of their grant proposal is to improve health outcomes with a mobile wellness program that will allow reach to underserved areas by taking services such as COVID testing, vaccines, reproductive health services, prevention education, immunizations, referrals and linkage to care directly to the county residents. The Charles County Mobile Integrated Health (MIH) program offers patients the option of having a healthcare team \u2014 a nurse, paramedic, and community health worker \u2014 visit a patient's home to ensure they reach wellness. The Charles County MIH program began bridging the gap of social determinants of health and delivering tailored healthcare to its target community in August 2017. Of the first 24 patients that met program criteria, the MIH program achieved a 74 percent reduction in emergency department visits and an 84 percent reduction in inpatient hospital admissions. The MIH team is empowering their patients' independence through wellness and improved healthcare.

The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) required LEAs to develop and submit a Reopening Plan fo r 2020-2021. Research has shown that in -person instruction is far more effective for students than virtual. Safely reopening schools is in the best interests of all, especially underserved communities. LEAs used the grant funds for a variety of activities necessary to safely reopen , includ ing: Purchase PPE, hand sanitizing stations, water bottles, air purifiers and replacement filters Musical instrument bell covers Summer interns to prepare student devices for deployment Additional custodians and supplemental cleaning services and supplies Additional school health staff to support testing, contact tracing The funds were available in July 2021. The grants end on 12/30/2024. The Reopening Schools Grant required an application, budget narrative and a link to the LEA's Reopening Plan. MSDE issues grants to LEAs. LEAs report expenditures on a monthly basis and MSDE reimburses the reported expenditures. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 46 State of Maryland 1E - Substance Use Providers Project ID 1E Project Name Substance Use Providers Subprojects 1 Budget $5,000,000 Expenditures $5,000,000 Status Completed Expenditure Category 1.13 - Behavioral Health: Substance Use Services Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 1E.1 Recovery Now -Maryland Department of Health -Assistance 8 -507 Providers $5,000,000 $5,000,000 Completed Project Description This project provided relief to court- ordered substance use residential treatment providers in financial jeopardy to ensure continuation of services and to support the increased demand for behavioral health services due to the pandemic.

The Commerce Subcabinet is comprised of the: Department of Commerce (Chair) Department of Agriculture Department of Housing and Community Development Department of Planning Department of Assessments and Taxation Department of Natural Resources Secretary of State Department of the Environment Maryland Higher Education Commission Department of Transportation Department of Labor The Subcabinet advises the governor on proposals to enhance the state's business climate; gathers information the Subcabinet considers necessary to promote its goals; collaborates to facilitate and expedite critical economic development projects in the state; and provide s other assistance that may be required to further the goals of the state and enhance its business climate. This cross -agency collaboration was valuable to the timely, prioritized allocation of SLFRF. On June 8, 2023, Governor Moore created the Maryland Economic Council by executive order to strengthen Maryland's economy. \"The Maryland Economic Council will build the robust economic strategy our state needs and our state deserves,\" said Governor Moore. \"For the next decade to be Maryland's decade, we must invest in the infrastructure, technology, and workforce to grow the i ndustries that will dominate the next half century of the world economy.\" The council will have no fewer than five and no more than fifteen members with training, knowledge, and experience in analyzing and interpreting economic data, developments and trends, appraising programs and activities of the government. The council will recommend economic policy in light of the international, national and state macroeconomic environment, and proposing strategies to build a more equitable economy. The Maryland Economic Council will submit an annual report to Governor Moore on or before January 1, 2024, and by October 1 each year following. The annual report will outline the current economic conditions impacting the macroeconomic environment. The report will evaluate the macroeconomic environment's impact on Maryland's economy and will recommend courses of action consistent with the duties of the council. The following section contains SLFRF outcome measures for reducing negative economic impacts . It is followed by project- specific information. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 49 State of Maryland Reducing Negative Economic Impacts Outcome Measures Outcomes measure economic recovery from the pandemic. Outcomes do not need to be entirely attributed to SLFRF projects, as many factors contribute to economic recovery. SLFRF is helping to move the needle. SLFRF has an impact on outcomes. How much of a relationship there is between SLFRF project activities and outcomes is open to interpretation. This report helps to serve that purpose. The following outcome meas ures are used for Reducing Negative Economic Impacts: Real Gross Domestic Product (GD P) by County and Industry Statewide Labor Force Participation Rate Statewide Unemployment Rate Jobs Created and Retained by County and Industry - Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Gross Domestic Product (GDP) represents the total value added in an economy and is defined as the final value of all goods and services produced in an area less the value of the goods and services used in production. GDP is the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA's) featured and most comprehensive measure of U.S. economic activity. GDP is therefore a key metric for policy makers and planners to track while monitoring Maryland's ongoing economic r ecovery. Real (inflation -adjusted) GDP in Maryland has recovered to pre- pandemic levels, as the chart below illustrates. In the first quarter of 2023, Maryland's real GDP was 0.1 percent larger than in the fourth quarter of 2019. Maryland Real (Inflation -Adjusted) Gross Domestic Product by Quarter, Q1 2018 - Q1 2023 Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 50 State of Maryland Maryland's GDP recovery has not extended to the private sector. Maryland's real GDP for private industries in the first quarter of 2023 was 1.1 percent below the fourth quarter of 2023. This indicates Maryland still has room to grow its economy. Maryland Real Gross Domestic Product for Private Industries by Quarter, Q1 2018 - Q1 2023 Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis The map below shows how GDP has changed by county between 2019 and 2021. Most counties in Maryland have recovered to pre- pandemic levels of total real GDP, with robust growth in Howard County and Montgomery County. Baltimore County and Anne Arundel County have experienced the largest contraction in real GDP during the pandemic. Monitoring these trends as new data is released helps ensure all Marylanders share in the economic recovery. Change in Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 2019 - 2021 Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 51 State of Maryland Labor Force Participation One of Maryland's strengths is its high labor force participation rate. As of May 2 023, Maryland had the eleventh highest proportion of its residents participating in the labor force (either employed or unemployed but looking for and able to begin a new job). Although Maryland's labor force participation rate ranks high, data from the Bu reau of Labor Statistics (BLS) suggests that Maryland's labor force has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. In contrast, the national labor force participation rate has steadily recovered. Nationally there is evidence to suggest that early retirements are playing a key role in the drop in the labor force participation rate relative to pre-pandemic. In Maryland, data from BLS suggests that the decrease may also be due to shifts in workers aged 25- 54. Policy makers will continue to monitor this metric to en sure the state's ongoing recovery leaves no group of workers behind. Labor Force Participation Rate in Maryland and United States, January 2018 - May 2023 Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics Unemployment The unemployment rate is an imperfect, if important, measure of economic conditions through the pandemic period. Individuals are considered unemployed if they are without a job and actively looking for work. Unemployment in Maryland peaked in April 2020 at 9.5 percent - the highest level on record for Maryland since the data began being collected in 1976. In May 2023, the unemployment rate hit 2.4%, the lowest level on record for the state. Each month of 2023 has matched or established a new record low for unemployment. The average unemployment rate of the past 20 years is 5.2%. Despite the strong current state of the economy, the state is committed to helping all individuals find meaningful employment, if they desire. Below are two maps of county unemployment rates. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 52 State of Maryland Both share the same color scale. Darker red represents relatively higher unemployment rates, while darker green shades represent lower unemployment rates. Recessions in the past 40 years have reached an average peak unemployment rate of 7.1 percent. This level of is shaded white. The first map shows the unemployment rate in April 2020, when most counties hit their highest level of unemployment. All but one county saw unemployment rates worse than the average recession from the past 40 years. The second map shows unemployment as of May 2023. All counties have reduced their unemployment rate. Furthermore, all counties improved on the long term statewide average unemployment rate of 5.2%. Furthermore, prior to 2020 the lowest statewide unemploym ent on record was 3.4%. As of May 2023, unemployment rates in all counties were below this; county unemployment rates ranged from 1.8% to 3.2%. Unemployment rate (%) - April 2020 Unemployment rate (%) - May 2023 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 53 State of Maryland As indicated by the labor force participation rate discussion above, many individuals either chose or were unable to work during the pandemic. As they were not actively looking for work, they were therefore not considered unemployed. As a result, the unemployment rate both understates the severity of the impact on Marylanders, and the degree of economic recovery for these working age individuals. Similarly, the state's current unemployment rate may be tricky to interpret given the unique economic climate. While it is relatively lower than the national average, this rate combined with the underlying trend in Maryland's labor force participation rate indicates that the continued economic recovery and a hot labor market are drawing people back to work at a rate exceeding the national average i n 2023. Jobs Created and Retained by County and Industry There are multiple sources for analyzing jobs created and retained in Maryland. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes the monthly Current Employment Statistics (CES) at the statewide level. Private industry, for example payroll company ADP, also provides statistics on jobs created and retained more frequently and at a more granular level down to zip codes and industries. For this report, we use the Quarterly Census of Emp loyment and Wages (QCEW). It is one of Maryland's most precisely measured economic indicators, as it includes all jobs covered by unemployment insurance, and is considered the gold standard for accuracy. Published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, it is the most granular jobs data released by BLS and shows data down to the workforce region by industry. Due to its comprehensive scope, QCEW data is updated through the end of 2022, as of this writing (July 2023). More recent statewide data for 2023 is taken from Current Employment Statistics, a complementary product produced by the BLS in conjunction with the Maryland Department of Labor. A quick and decisive response by the state at the beginning of the pandemic led to 86 percent of jobs being retained through the low point of the accompanying recession. This matches the national rate of job retention, despite the robust steps taken statew ide to combat the early spread of COVID-19. Through December 2022, Maryland has regained or added 349,800 jobs from the pandemic low in April 2020, representing a net recovery of 98.4 percent of jobs lost. In 2020, many companies continued to shed jobs even as the broader economy began to make a comeback. Early 2020 represented the highest employment levels in Maryland on record. As a result, these broad figures likely underestimate the true degree of recovery experienced in Maryland. The map below shows job retention rates by county using February 2020 as the baseline, and April 2020 as the low point of the pandemic-driven job losses. Job retention in Maryland counties varied from 74 percent to 92 percent. The second map below shows job recovery, a s a percent of jobs lost at the start of the pandemic. By the end of 2022, 11 counties have recovered, on net, all jobs lost during the onset of the pandemic. In the early recovery, job retention and job recovery appear to not be meaningfully correlated -the most resilient counties also tended to see quick strong recoveries in the 18 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 54 State of Maryland months following the pandemic onset. However, that relationship has largely disappeared. Early pandemic job retention is no longer meaningfully correlated with jobs regained. Relative to 2021, some counties even saw decreased employment year- over-year. However, the overall speed and magnitude of the recovery have been strong. In comparison, the economic recovery following the 2008 recession took more than 5 years to reach the level of recovery shown by a year and a half from the end of the pandemic recession. Support from federal dollars and local efforts from 2020 onwards have almost certainly played a major role in this rapid recovery. Job Retention by County, February 2020 - April 2020 (net percent) Jobs Regained by County, April 2020 - December 2021 (net percent) Looking at industry employment data tells a similar story - Significant strides have been made across the board despite significant setbacks in 2020. The chart below looks at the same jobs retained and jobs regained metrics described above. Jobs retained m easures what percentage of jobs remained on payroll in April 2020, compared to February 2020. Higher numbers indicate 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 55 State of Maryland that fewer jobs were lost. The table below also compares current (as of December 2022) job levels by industry, compared to the pre-pandemic level. A 100% rating implies that the number of jobs is the same currently, compared to before the pandemic. Higher numbers indicate an industry has grown since the pandemic. Total jobs are at 99.4% of pre-pandemic levels, and 8 of industries have mor e employees than prior to the pandemic. Jobs Retained During Pandemic and Current Jobs vs. Pre-pandemic The Maryland Department of Labor has been tracking more detailed recovery measures by industry within each county, and has promoted the availability of this analysis to workforce partners and the general public to help inform recovery efforts. Analysis through the end of 2021 is available at the publications page on the Maryland Workforce Exchange in the Annual Economic Reports section. A similar analysis, looking at employment metrics through the end of 2022, will be made available at the same URL by October 3, 2023. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 56 State of Maryland 2A - Business Assistance to Industry: Hospitality and Entertainment Project ID 2A Project Name Business Assistance: Entertainment and Hospitality Subprojects 5 Budget $50,969,588 Expenditures $50,969,588 Status Completed Expenditure Category 2.35 -Aid to Impacted Industries: Aid to Tourism, Travel, or Hospitality Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 2A.1 Recovery Now -Department of Commerce - Hotel, Motel, and Bed and Breakfast Grants $9,969,589 $9,969,589 Completed 2A.2 Recovery Now -Department of $22,000,000 Completed 2A.3 Recovery -Department -Small Marketing Grants $999,998 Recovery Now -Live Performance $10,000,000 $10,000,000 Completed 2A.5 Recovery Now - Department of Commerce - Local Commuter Bus Assistance Grants $8,000,000 $8,000,000 Completed Project Description This project provided financial aid to tourism, travel, and hospitality industries.

Lending activity nearly came to a halt as businesses closed. Commerce and the fund managers agreed that 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 74 State of Maryland the terms needed to be modified to help existing businesses in the portfolio to stay afloat. Businesses were offered up to 6 months in payment and interest deferments. As the economy recovers, these businesses will need access to capital with flexible terms in order to survive.

Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA), Maryland's Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) program, provides cash assistance to families with dependent children when available resources do not fully address the family's needs and while preparing program participants for independence through work. The number of individuals participating in the TANF program increased from approximately 25,000 pre-pandemic to over 57,000 during the pandemic. SLFRF helped the state to support these individuals and families. This project's outcomes were to: Aid in the recovery of income for Maryland's families. Reduce the prevalence of very low food security Reduce the percent of families with children and youth under age 18 whose income is below the poverty level 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 78 State of Maryland 2D.1 -Re Enrolled -Department of Human Services - Temporary Disability Assistance Program ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 2D.1 Re Enrolled -Department of Human Services -Temporary Disability Assistance Program $11,319,753 $11,319,753 Completed Due to pandemic related closures, the Department of Human Services offered waivers of certain requirements (including medical certification of disability) and extended recertification time periods for the Temporary Disability Assistance Program (TDAP). Following the end of the waiver of verification requirements and a temporary restart of recertifications, the TDAP caseload declined substantially from a peak of 16,407 recipients in June 2020 to 7,491 recipients in December 2020. This decrease was attribu ted to challenges related to reduced in -person operations and accessing medical professionals to certify disabilities resulting in case closures for documentation issues. Except as the result of a final determination of a Supplemental Security Income claim, under provision of Recovery Now, Maryland retroactively re -enrolled TDAP participants denied payments on or after July 1, 2020 and prevented the removal of participants from the program until July 1, 2021. Those that were re-enrolled began receiving regular TDAP benefits with the $100 per month supplement and received retroactive benefits to the date they were initially denied payment.

The maximum TCA benefit for a household of three in federal fiscal year 2021 was $727. With the additional $100 per recipient, the same household could receiv e up to $1,027 monthly. This monthly supplement of an additional $100 per month was extended to Temporary Disability Assistance Program (TDAP) recipients from February through June 2 021. TDAP is the state's cash assistance program for disabled adults which provides a limited monthly benefit for individuals with a short- term disability (at least 3 months but less than 12 months) or long -term disability. If the individual has a long- term disability, they are required to pursue a federal Supplemental Security Income (SSI) application. The individual receives a benefit until a final SSI decision has been reached. The TDAP benefit in the state fiscal year 2021 was $243. With the additional $100, TDAP recipients received up to $343 monthly. The TDAP benefit increased in October 2021. Maryland supported the TDAP with additional benefits and continued both programs through the end of calendar year 2021 with SLFRF. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 80 State of Maryland 2D.3 -TCA Costs Associated with the Pandemic ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 2D.3 TCA Costs Associated with the Pandemic $140,000,000 $140,000,000 Completed The Temporary Cash Assistance (TCA) program is Maryland's largest cash assistance program. TCA provides financial assistance to dependent children and family members due to unemployment/underemployment, death, or incapacitation of one or both parents. TCA is primarily funded through the fed eral Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant. The TCA active caseload during the pandemic shutdown ( March to July 2020) increased by 64%. The chart below shows Temporary Cash Assistance cases from 2013 to May 2023. Maryland invested $140 million in SLFRF for the Temporary Cash Assistance program to support the caseload growth. $50 million was made available to support program costs from March 3, 2021 to June 30, 2021, the end of state fiscal year 2021. The remaining $90 milli on in funding was available to support the TCA program through state fiscal year 2022.

Utility companies were authorized to establish a limited - income mechanism, such as a credit, rate, or rider. Eligible limited -income customers are defined as those with annual incomes at or below 175% of the federal poverty line (200% for those 67 years or older). Participating limited -income customers remain eligible for other state administered assistance programs. Use of Evidence \"Energy burden\" reflects the disproportionate use of financial resources for low- income households on energy costs . Compared to middle - and upper-income households that spend 5 percent or less of their total household income on energy, low-income households spend 10 percent or more of their income on energy expenses. The burden is even greater among the very poor, who are likely to spend upwards of 20 percent on energy purchases.\" 17 Performance Total customers served by limited income mechanism Total reduction in energy expenses for customers using the mechanism 17 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4819257 / 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 85 State of Maryland 2F.2 - Emergency Assistance for Late Utility Bills (PC53) ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 2F.2 Emergency Assistance for Late Utility Bills (PC53) $83,000,000 $83,000,000 Completed This SLFRF project provided emergency assistance to gas and electric utilities providers to reduce customer arrearages (late bills).

Grants across three defined categories were provided with the goal of reducing or eliminating residential customer bill arrearages, with a focus on people in-need. Project Activities Maryland utilities reported that thousands of residential customers fell behind on their bills for electric and gas service during the pandemic. The Maryland General Assembly targeted $83 million to alleviate a portion of the $276 million owed by utility customers, many of whom faced significant hardship from loss of employment or reduced hours and income. Utility arrearages grew 123.5% between October 2019 to October 2020. The PSC issued Order No. 89856 directing the funding distribution and requirements for reporting. Only residential customer accounts with arrearages that accumulated before June 30, 2021 were eligible. Grants were applied to amounts owed by customers in the following order: Category 1 Category 2 Category 3 Customers who received prior energy assistance from the Department of Human Services, Office of Home Energy Programs (OHEP) within the last four years. Customers with special medical needs certificates on file with their utility for a medical condition that requires electricity for maintaining health. Customers with the oldest arrearages (late bills). 100% retired -$56 million 100% retired -$3 million ~10% retired -$24 million Customers did not need to take any action to receive the funding, funds appeared as bill credits from July through September of 2021. The order directed electric and gas utilities to communicate with customers regarding the application of SLFRF to their past -due bills. The utilities were directed to include messaging to inform customers of their options for energy assistance, including Office of Home Energy Programs (OHEP) and utility payment plans. Utilities were also directed to include a letter stating the Maryland Office of People's Counsel and the Maryland Fuel Fund could help customers seeking assistance. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 86 State of Maryland Community Engagement A three -day Public Conference (PC 53) was held to engage stakeholders. A press release on July 8, 2021 announced the PC 53 proceedings, including social media posts and notices issued by the executive secretary. All parties were given time at the virtual hearing to provide comments and recommendations on best practices for how arrearage forgiveness should be distributed. In addition, the statutory parties (Technical Staff and OPC) both have mandates to represent broad residential interests and ensure that while any individual may not have sufficient resources to participate in the Commission's process the collective interests are still presented. Following the Public Conference, the Chairman and Commissioners drafted the Order for release on June 15, 2021 and immediate dispersal of the funding. Two subsequent press releases on August 31 st and September 22nd explained the outcomes of the public conference and debt relief dispersal. Timeline Utility data collection took place from April through May 2021, grants were awarded in June 2021, and bill credits were dispersed from July through September 2021. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners The grants were provided to twenty (20) utility providers across all jurisdictions. P artners include the Office of Home Energy Programs (OHEP) and the Maryland Office of People's Counsel. Intended Outcomes Debt relief to support economically disadvantaged Marylanders Lower the statewide arrearage balances reported by utility companies Use of Evidence \"Energy burden\" reflects the disproportionate allocation of financial resources among low - income households on energy expenditures. Compared to middle- and upper-income households that spend 5% or less of their total household income on energy purchases, low- income households spend 10% or more of their income on energy expenses. The burden is even greater among the very poor, who are likely to spend upwards of 20% on energy purchases. 18 These statistics serve as evidence to the legitimacy of the three categories outlined in the order. Performance Overall, the 2021 Maryland Public Service Commission Annual Report describes statewide arrearages have dropped back to approximate pre-pandem ic levels for most utilities . 18 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4819257 / 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 87 State of Maryland Measures 1.

The EHP was funded under the State RELIEF Act, which provided $15 million in additional funding for up to 30 days of emergency housing to respond to the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Funding was administered through direct allocations to Maryland's 16 Continua of Care (CoCs) and Local Homeless Coalitions for the purpose of preventing, reducing, and ending homelessness within their jurisdictions, and providing emergency assistance to mitigate the economic impact of the COVID -19 crisis on vulnerable households. Specifi cally, they were used to assist households experiencing homelessness to be connected with emergency shelter, quickly regain stability in permanent housing and to prevent households from becoming homeless. The goals of the program include efforts to: Provide street outreach to connect people experiencing homelessness to shelter and essential services; Provide shelter as a crisis response for people experiencing homelessness; Reduce the number of individuals/households who become homeless; Shorten the length of time an individual or household is homeless; Reduce the number of individuals/households that return to homelessness; and Provide fixed or short- term rental assistance payments to people at risk of being homeless. Project Activities The Emergency Housing Program provides funding for the following activities: 1. Street Outreach . Engagement and case management provided to unsheltered individuals and families. Under this grant, Street Outreach Services should be billed under Administration. 2. Emergency Shelter. Emergency Shelter covers activities that connect people with immediate access to overnight shelter to respond to a crisis. Funding provided for Emergency Shelter can be used both to pay for the operations of the shelter , such as rent and utilities, as well as services provided by the shelter, including case management. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 92 State of Maryland 3. Hotel/Motel. Hotel/motel covers both vouchers and master leases to secure hotel/motel rooms to de- congregate shelters. Client agreements for hotel/mote ls should be paid thirty days at a time. 4. Rental Assistance. Rental assistance designed to help people experiencing or at risk of homelessness access and remain in permanent housing. Eligible costs include Security Deposits, Current Month's Rent and Future Rent (30 days at a time), but does not include rental arrears, utilities or case management services. Rental Assistance should be targeted to households experiencing or at-risk of homelessness, but not limited to the HUD definitions of homelessness. 5. Housing Stability (Rapid Rehousing and Homelessness Prevention) Services. Housing stability services that enable eligible households to maintain or obtain housing, such as housing counseling, fair housing counseling, case management related to housing stabil ity, outreach to households at risk of eviction or promotion of housing support programs, housing related services for survivors of domestic abuse or human trafficking, and specialized services for individuals with disabilities or seniors that support their ability to access or maintain housing,\" as well as \"legal aid such as legal services or attorney's fees related to eviction proceedings and maintaining housing stability, court-based eviction prevention or eviction diversion programs, and other legal ser vices that help households maintain or obtain housing. 6. Administrative Expenses (including Outreach and Emergency Shelter services). Administrative funding can be used to help cover salaries of agency employees that perform necessary activities for street outreach, Emergency Shelter as well as financial reporting, processing rental applications , and managing data collection and reporting through an HMIS database. Equity -Related Activities Maryland DHCD used a funding formula, which included each community's share of rental units as the baseline (rather than total population), and then weighted the funding allocations using the Urban Institute's Eviction Risk Average Percentile Score, which assigns an \"equity percentile\" or score to every census tr act. The percentile represents that area's prevalence of risk factors for eviction and becoming homeless relative to other areas within the state. For example, tenants in a county with an average equity percentile of 50% have a higher risk of eviction than 50% of other counties in the state. Those tenants are more than twice as likely to experience eviction / homelessness than tenants in a county with an average equity percentile of 25%. The data used to create percentiles/scores considers housing instabili ty risk factors, COVID19 impact, and equity. In addition to using an equity weighted funding formula, Emergency Housing Program funds are targeted to serve clients experiencing, or at risk of homelessness. Clients were required to meet the following crite ria: At or below 50% AMI, and currently behind on rent; OR Currently experiencing homelessness as defined as lacking a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 93 State of Maryland Community Engagement Related Activities All funding was distributed through local Cont inuum of Care or Local Homeless Coalitions, which are the local coordinating bodies for homeless services in each jurisdiction. CoC and LHC Executive Boards include members from local homeless service providers, government representatives and individuals w ith lived experience. Timeline The original contract period for EHP funds was March 1, 2021-June 30, 2022, although several contracts have been extended through June 30, 2026. Communities are under tight expenditure deadlines for several COVID relief funds, and the additional time allows them to target and ensure continuity of services for the most vulnerable community members more effectively. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners Funding is distributed to the lead agency for the Continuum of Care in each jurisdiction, and sub granted to local service providers.

Use of Evidence All EHP -funded programs are required to use a Housing First approach to providing homeless services. The Results First Clearin ghouse indicates Housing First had a positive impact based on the most rigorous evidence: Housing First programs address chronic homelessness by providing rapid access to permanent housing, without a precondition of treatment, along with ongoing support services such as crisis intervention, needs assessment, and case management. A form of permanent supportive housing, the program usually serves individuals who are chronically homeless and have persistent mental illness or problems with substance abuse and addiction. Clients can be placed in apartments throughout a community or a centralized housing location with on-site support for those requiring more intensive services; clients receive housing regardless of substance use. 19 Performance All providers receiving EHP funding are required to input client demographic data and outcomes in their local Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). EHP contracts run through June 2026, and HMIS data in the Maryland State Homelessness Data Warehouse runs through March 30, 2023. This data is used to monitor program quality for providers, and to evaluate system wide performance for each jurisdiction's homeless service system. The total clients and households served by service type are listed below.

The health and economic emergencies caused by the COVID -19 pandemic have both exacerbated existing civil legal problems and created new ones. Issues related to eviction have become even more complicated and having an experienced advocate can make a tremendous difference for a low- income Marylander who, if not for civil legal aid, would be forced to navi gate the legal system alone. The vital work of legal services organizations ensures all Marylanders - not just those with the ability to pay for legal assistance - get the help they need to stay housed. All MLSC funds are used to serve households at or below 50% of Maryland median income, which includes at least 1.3 million Marylanders. Project Activities MLSC made subgrants to eight (8) civil legal aid organizations to provide eviction prevention legal services for low -income Marylanders. The subgra ntees make use of both staffed legal services programs and the engagement of the private bar to provide pro bono and low bono service. Civil legal aid organizations provide a variety of services, including offering self- help resources, assisting with re ntal assistance applications and proper documentation, negotiating with administrative units and landlords, and providing an attorney for full representation in court. Legal aid attorneys working with current MLSC grantees have helped clients achieve a r ange of outcomes in their cases, including avoiding eviction, delaying eviction so the tenant has additional time to move, avoiding a loss of a housing subsidy, and enforcing a tenant's rights under a lease and more. Equity Related Activities MLSC's project data to -date reflects the fact that evictions disproportionately impact women and renters of color. Of the 2,580 closed cases from July 1, 2021 through March 31, 2022, 86% were for clients of color and 70% for wo men. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 97 State of Maryland Community Engagement Related Activities MLSC's nonprofit subgrantees have expertise regarding models that work best in each of Maryland's jurisdictions and tailor their services accordingly. These organizations are well-established and trusted members of their local communities, with the backing and collaboration of a statewide delivery system. They also partner with community -based organizations to provide workshops, staff community events, and provide general information on how to access legal services. MLSC's grants were also awarded with access for specific communities in mind. For example, subgrantee CASA serves immigrants, many of whom have limited English proficiency, and Disability Rights Maryland serves individuals with disabilities. Man y sub- grantees collect feedback from clients, but due to the hard- to-reach nature of the population served, it is difficult to maintain contact after cases are closed. Timeline MLSC received $3 million in funding on March 18, 2021, and held the funds for deployment beginning July 1, 2021, which allowed for consideration of eviction moratoria and pending legislation . Funds were then distributed in FY22 and FY23. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners MLSC made subgrants to CASA, Community Legal Services of Prince George's County, Disability Rights Maryland, Homeless Persons Representation Project, Maryland Legal Aid, Mid-Shore Pro Bono, Pro Bono Resource Center and Public Justice Center. All organizations perform pre- trial intake where a staff person evaluates the case and helps to match the client with an attorney. Several grantees are also performing day -of services, where clients may not have been connected with a legal services provider prior to the ir hearing, but have the chance to consult an attorney to receive representation through in-court intake. Equity Related Awareness, Access, and Distribution The main differences in level of access are related to geography. Subgrantees are currently offering day-of- court services in Baltimore City, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Caroline, Dorchester, Kent and Prince George's counties. Due to space limitations, staffing constraints or other issues, in-court intake is not provided in other counties at this time. Additionally, clients with limited English proficiency and limited internet access face additional barriers in learning about services. Both MLSC grantees and the Maryland Courts have attempted to address these issues through translation services and in-person outreach. Intended Outcomes Stable housing for Maryland families Reduce the number of Marylanders experiencing homelessness Mitigate/reduce the eviction of rental tenants 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 98 State of Maryland Equity Related Outcomes As evictions disproportionately impact tenants of color, all intended outcomes increase equity. While services are statewide, funding was concentrated in areas with high percentages of low - income tenants, for example in Baltimore City. Some funding was als o reserved to target traditionally marginalized communities, including immigrants, people with disabilities, tenants in public housing, and with housing vouchers. Use of Evidence Evictions disproportionately affect women and renters of color. A report b y Tim Thomas of the University of California at Berkeley showed that the number of Black women evicted is 3.9 times higher than the number of white men evicted in Baltimore City (https://evictions.study/maryland/report/baltimore.html). However, legal representation can help address this disparity, as a study by Stout Risius Ross LLC found that attorneys are successful in preventing disruptive di splacement of Baltimore renters in 92% of the eviction cases they are involved in (https://bmorerentersunited.org/rtc/stoutreport/ ). Performance Note: All household income is at or below 50% of Maryland median income. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 99 State of Maryland 2G - Non-Profit Assistance Project ID 2G Project Name Non-Profit Assistance Subprojects 5 Budget $46,870,041 Expenditures $46,870,041 Status Completed Expenditure Category 2.34 -Assistance to Nonprofits: Assistance to Impacted Nonprofit Organizations (Impacted or Disproportionately Impacted) Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 2G.1 Recovery Now -Department of Commerce -Arts Council $4,997,000 $4,997,000 Completed 2G.2 Recovery Now -Department of Housing and Community Development - Non-Profit Assistance Grants $20,000,000 $20,000,000 Completed 2G.3 Recovery Now -Department of Human Services - Food Bank Grants $10,000,000 $10,000,000 Completed 2G.4 Recovery Now -Maryland Department of Emergency Management - Volunteer Fire Department and Rescue Squad Grants $4,000,000 $4,000,000 Completed 2G.5 Residential Treatment Centers $7,873,041 $7,873,041 Completed Project Description Nonprofit organizations were impacted in various ways by the pandemic.

Funds were distributed to local governments in April 2021 and the grants were awarded to nonprofits by September 30, 2021. Use of Evidence The Center for Effective Philanthropy published the report, Preserving Through Crisis: The State of Nonprofits, in June 2021. The report stated that most nonprofits leaders reported a decline in revenue in 2020 compared to prior years and at the same time \"half of nonprofit leaders say demand for their programs and services increased, and 39 percent say their costs increased.\" 20 Performance Link to Allocation of funding based on population. 20 https://cep.org/wp -content/uploads/2021/06/CEP_Persevering -through- Crisis_2021.pdf 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 104 State Maryland 2G.3 -Recovery Now -Department of Human Services -Food Bank Grants ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 2G.3 Recovery Now -Department of Human Services - Food Bank Grants $10,000,000 $10,000,000 Completed Marylanders experiencing low to very low food security increased during the pandemic state of emergency. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) caseload increased by 25%. While stimulus payments offered temporary relief to low -income Maryland ers, through the end of June 2021, demand for SNAP remained elevated. The following chart illustrates Maryland's Food Supplement cases from J uly 2013 to April 2023. To further support food security, this SLFRF project provided $3,237,776 to the Capital Area Food Bank (CAFB) and $6,762,224 to the Maryland Food Bank (MFB) . The CAFB delivers food to nonprofit food assistance partners, or in some cases through direct distribution to the community, in Prince George's and Montgom ery Counties. The MFB services all other parts of Maryland. MFB works with a network of community and organizational partners including food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters, and faith- based organizations that serve food- insecure Marylanders. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 105 State of Maryland The Maryland Food Bank supports roughly 322 partners statewide that collectively provide nearly 1,450 distribution points with much- needed food for their local communities. In the winter of 2021, a Maryland Food Bank survey found 33% of respondents have been affected by hunger or food insecurity themselves. From March to May 2022, people registered through the 211-Maryland helpline calling for food assistance increased by 2 5%. Use of Evidence The United States Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service recognized food insecurity was exacerbated by the pandemic. One example of the need to address food insecurity is to ensure children are able to focus and succeed in school. According to the National Education Association, \"the Food Research and Action Center (FRAC) and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasize the importance of good nutr ition in children when it comes to performing well in school.\" 21 21 https://www.nea.org/student-success/smart- just-policies/funding -public -schools/nutrition -programs of Maryland 2G.4 -Recovery Now -Maryland Department of Emergency Management - V olunteer Fire Department and Rescue Squad Grants ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 2G.4 Recovery Now -Maryland Department of Emergency Management - Volunteer Fire Department and Rescue Squad Grants $4,000,000 $4,000,000 Completed The Maryland Department of Emergency Management (MDEM) provided grants to volunteer fire departments and rescue squads that lost revenue due to COVID-19 and had not received other relief .

The funding is used to offset losses experienced or expenditures realized between the onset of the COVID -19 pandemic through the end of the grant period. Residential Treatment Center provider rates are cost settled each year and are subject to an Upper Payment Limit test - meaning the payment rate cannot exceed actual costs. Financial assistance in the form of a higher Medicaid rate does not help the providers. These additional Medicaid dollars would only be collected back from the providers. This is because the Upper Payment Limit Test does not allow the spread of costs to only occupied beds.

Baltimore County Department of Workforce Development's primary targets fo r these ARPA- funded workforce initiatives are the County's highest need sectors, our underserved workers, and youth. As a result, we focused on programs that would support workers in vulnerable industries, many of whom were already working less than full-t ime schedules or who were the first to be furloughed or laid off . While our underemployed and underserved residents were the hardest hit, our youth lost opportunities to gain valuable entry- level workplace skills. DEWD was initially modeled after EARN Mary land with an initiative titled, \"Building Economic, Employment and Cultural Opportunities (BEECO), however, it has been continually reimagining the use of ARPA funding to meet the targeted workforce and labor market needs. Carroll County Workforce Develop ment Board is focusing its equity- based activities for the following area residents: In-school youth impacted by COVID-19 due to closure of schools and the shift to online learning who lost opportunities over the past two and a half years Low to moderate income adults and youth who are unemployed or underemployed Low to moderate income adults and youth who are employed but seeking new employment opportunities with greater access to economic advancement Employ Prince George's at the Prince George's County Workforce Development Board engages individuals who want to and are available to work .

Outreach plans and strategies are used to reach populations generally underserved and underrepresented who experience higher levels of poverty and limited access to services. Howard County Workforce Development Center has an overarching goal of allocating award funds in ways that expand access to apprenticeship , employment, and training programs to create and enhance services to disproportionately impacted communities and individuals. Howard County seeks to address specific needs for traditionally disadvantaged populations and make long- term investments in communities that are designed to promote equity and recovery from the COVID- 19 pandemic . Baltimore City (MOED, Mayor's Office of Employment Development) region was disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and the economic downtown that resulted. Baltimore's unemployment rate jumped to over 12% and disrupted the city's economy. The number of residents filing for unemployment increased by nearly 18,000 between February and March of 2020. These challenges, among others, formed the basis for the city's economic recovery strategy that included targeted initiatives to return residents to work quickly (Hire Up), skill them up (Train Up, G2C, and Apprenticeship), and incre ase access to services (Community Job Hubs and mobile career navigators). Susquehanna Workforce Network, Inc. (SWN) provides additional outreach and community engagement to help more impacted and disproportionately impacted individuals recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals reached through this grant, including low- and moderate- income households, those with other significant barriers to services, and other harder to reach groups needing access to workforce and career services. Tri County Counci l of Lower Eastern Shore Workforce Alliances serve impacted and disproportionately impacted populations. These include individuals, families, and employers who are impacted by poverty, incarceration, unreliable transportation, a lack of access to workforce training, a lack of access to health care, computer illiteracy, and a lack of workforce qualifications. Tri County Council of Southern Maryland's ARPA program has consistently been shared with other local community agencies who serve individuals with significant barriers, such as LifeStyles, Three Oaks, DORS, food pantries, churches, and juvenile services. Upper Shore Workforce Investment Board realized the severe impact of COVID -19 pandemic on low-to-moderate income households and individuals and designed a program to address the needs of the residents of the area using ARPA funds. The hospitality/tourism industry is very large in the Upper Shore counties, and this industry sector was devastated due to COVID-19. This has been a major disruption in the workforce of predominantly low wage jobs and continues to create staffing challenges for employers. All of this has resulted in loss of income, work insecurity, job placement instability, or simply not participating in the workforce due to other COVID- 19 issues such as caring for family members, medical complications f rom COVID -19, or loss of childcare providers. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 118 State of Maryland USWIB's focus has been to look at the designation of non- essential workers (negative economic impact experienced) and essential workers (public health requirements). For the non- essential worker who has experienced economic impact, our focus has been on fulfilling their desire to get workforce training that allows them to move into a new and potentially more secure job and career. Essential workers, those who were required to work during the pandemic, have missed opportunities to get career training due to their work schedule or training providers unable to provide it due to COVID-19. Both groups are eligible to ARPA funded workforce training, and we are continuing to see tremendous interest from the Upper Shore residents. Workforce Montgomery of Montgomery County Workforce Development Board has engaged in a Measurable Equity initiative with a goal that All Montgomery County Residents will have career pathways that lead to equitable and sustainable economic mobility. This action statement, while simple and broad, requires WSM to operate in a data-driven high- impact space as it pertains to strategy formulation and program implementation. WSM believes this approach is necessary to create sustainable change and pro gress for all Montgomery County Residents\u2014 especially those from low -income under-resourced communities. WSM has opted to focus on serving Disconnected Youth, English Learners, Dislocated Workers, Small and Minority- Owned Businesses, Homeless Residents, Ex -Offenders, Immigrants, Low -Income Households, Women, etc. All populations that are part of the disproportionately impacted sectors in the workforce in Maryland and nationally. The Western Maryland Consortium is working with recovery houses, offenders, and ESL populations via multiple partnerships and alliances, besides the Poverty Alleviation Plan mentioned in the above section. Some other programs, to assure equitable access to resources, conducted and are in action are: Transition Fairs for DORS Recovery Day Events Community Spring Wellness Fair National Night Out Clothing Drive & Career Expo 2022 Partnership with DSS and Libraries Community Engagement Related Activities Anne Arundel Workforce Development (AAWDC) has several satellite locations locat ed in low- income areas in Anne Arundel County including Brooklyn Park, Freetown, Fort Meade, and Annapolis to provide services and be more accessible to individuals in their own communities. Many of the individuals in these communities have significant bar riers that prevent them from gaining and maintaining employment. Access to childcare and reliable transportation are two of the most identified barriers that individuals disclose. AAWDC utilizes ARPA funds to assist these individuals that traditionally work in industries that were impacted by the pandemic. Baltimore County Department of Workforce Development carries out the critical mission of providing pathways to the middle class for individuals with barriers to employment, DEWD 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 119 State of Maryland relies on its education partners - such as the Community College of Baltimore County. Serving these populations has never been easy, but the pandemic has made the task even more difficult because the lower -skilled workers across all industries were among the first to be dislocate d from their employment. With the initiative, BC2 - Building Capacity in Baltimore County, this initiative will identify the Community Based Organizations (CBO's) and/or Social Enterprises interested in expanding their abilities and capacities so that they can support the needs of these targeted Baltimore County residents. It also identifies individuals seeking employment with these organizations, or searching for self-employment/entrepreneurial opportunities, and will prepare them to serve the needs of the targeted WIOA populations. Carroll County Workforce Development Board ARPA funding has enabled CCWD to purchase equipment to provide direct services to underserved populations outside of the office center. CCWD has been able to purchase virtual tools and programs to reach low- income individuals and individuals with transportation issues. Following the training of new staff, CCWD has a plan underway to go out to underserved communities in Carroll County that have high levels of poverty and barriers to bring services directly to them in local libraries and the 7 municipalities Town Halls. CCWDB is working with mandated partners to attend these with CCWD to help address the multiple barriers of our citizens. Employ Prince George's at the Prince George's Work force Development Board is using a data driven strategy to ensure ARPA funds are designated for Prince George's County residents most in need as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic. The Workforce Board partnered with National Association of Workforce Boards (NAWB) to create an interactive map of the Qualified Census Tracts that represent the households in the county that are most in need. The team uses this information to plan outreach events, community engagement activities and job fairs in these areas so th ey become accessible. Additionally, the EMSI Skills Report revealed that \"only a few career areas with above average earnings employ an above average share of female, Black, Hispanic and Latino Workers. Results show that most in -demand skill clusters have low - earnings, whereas employer demand is variable for skill clusters with higher earnings.\" This valuable labor market information is driving our Business Advisory Councils (BAC's) to focus on aligning our program structure and offerings to be inclusive of these underrepresented populations. Frederick County Workforce Services ' outreach and engagement strategies include reaching areas of the county with underrepresented populations, and persons of color. FCWS engages the community by organizing activities and programs based on the needs of the participants. FCWS engaged businesses (68) by offering unique professional development opportunities for their employees, providing supportive services to individual participants, and offering subsidized employment for new hires. Another outreach strategy employed by FCWS is to partner wi th the community college to provide multiple training areas based on the workforce needs of the county. To date, funds have been primarily used to train a diverse workforce in areas of high growth, high demand such as healthcare and biotechnology. FCWS us es a \"Pandemic Impact Determination\" application process and screen for eligible businesses and individuals. Baltimore City (MOED, Mayor's Office of Employment Development) has formed strong partnerships with the community organizations that serve resid ents with barriers to services. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 120 State of Maryland Nearly $3 million in state ARPA funds support eleven community- based organizations that will provide occupational training. These occupational training providers are formally linked to Community Connectors which serve as nei ghborhood- based on- ramps to work for jobseekers. Tri County Council of Lower Eastern Shore Workforce Alliances has used ARPA funding to increase community engagement in significant ways. Coordination and collaborative efforts within the lower eastern shore agencies: Somerset, Wicomico and Worcester County Departments of Social Services has been the primary source of the overwhelming positive impact on recruitment efforts. Additionally, the pre -employment and post -training employment activities take place at the American Jobs Centers. Programs are made accessible to people of every protected category, according to State and Federal law, to ensure that traditionally underserved communities may access the training. Tri County Council of Southern Maryland focuses on the use of funds to support businesses in the region who have experienced impacts at no fault of their own. As a workforce region, TCCSM realizes the importance of supporting businesses during this time so that the region, as a whole, can become more economically viable. To engage individual job seekers, TCCSM holds job fairs and guides the participants through various program offers of their choosing. ARPA Program has joined forces with several partner agencies (WIOA, Veterans, Re-entry, SCEP, MD Labor) to create an outreach task force team designed to reach the underserved populations. This outreach team has to saturate the regional community events each month, connecting with hundreds of our TCCSM residents. TCCSM's ARPA Program information has been shared with community partners in the region and goes out to over 13,000 unemployed residents weekly. Upper Shore Investment Board (USWIB) has connected with the Black African American Males (BAAM ) in Easton to offer scholarships for applicants as t hey build out a soft skills program serving this group with significant barriers to employment. USWIB has developed relationships with the local Department of Social Services (DSS) in all five counties to obtain referrals from non-SNAP eligible customers u nder an MOU on the Upper Shore). UWIB had a recent regional job fair where residents were informed of the workforces resources and programs to job seekers in attendance. An additional job fair is planned in the fourth quarter of FY23. The Western Marylan d Consortium focused on community engagement activities by inviting the residents of the region to multiple Jobs Fairs - with American Job Center, Veterans Outreach, Public Schools, Colleges Goodwill, Community Action Council, Tristate Job Fair. Also held events such as Business Hiring Blitz. Worksource Montgomery (WSM) created the Workforce Recovery Network (WRN). The WRN provides funding to support/expand local community-based organizations that provide employment and training services to individuals negatively impacted by the pandemic. Additionally, the programs may also serve those who are: low -income, have criminal backgrounds, have disabilities, homeless, Veterans, English language learners, youth, or have other barriers to employment. Programs and se rvices targeting individuals in Montgomery County's high poverty rate census tracts as well as the communities near the pending Purple Metro Line corridor are also encouraged to apply for WRN funding. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 121 State of Maryland Use of Evidence Anne Arundel Workforce Development ( AAWDC) As part of Case Management policy, AAWDC utilizes an evidence- based process for achieving successful outcomes for participants. This process includes providing intensive services to participants, including, but not limited to, career coach 1:1 counseling, occupational training, supportive services, and workshops. Providing intensive services help participants gain employment at a family sustaining wage compared to individuals that did not receive assistance. Baltimore County Department of Workforce Development programs are anchored in best practices in accordance with the Innovations in Maryland's Local Workforce Plan located on the Maryland Department of Labor website. Both healthcare and education, two of the nine identified workforce sectors, receive premier focus in our ARPA plan. In addition, plans focus on building homegrown talent, improving opportunities for youth, and stronger training to employment connections. Employ Prince George's at the Prince George's Workfor ce Development Board maintains a strong partnership with EMSI Burning Glass to ensure our programs are aligned with the most recent labor market intelligence available. The Workforce Development Board released a Regional Skills Analysis and a Sector Strate gy Study to effectively support employers who represent in -demand occupations in this post COVID-19 labor market. Although these are not evidenced based strategies, they are labor market informed strategies, which allow us to effectively develop and adjust programming according to real time data. Frederick County Workforce Services relies on research studies completed by Community Foundation, United Way and other non-profit, service-based organizations. FCWS confers with the economic and labor market data, demographic data, of the county to support the demand of the local economy adversely affected by COVID -19 pandemic. Baltimore City (MOED, Mayor's Office of Employment Development) bases its workforce activities on well researched and evidence- based programming. These programs lead to higher earnings, greater likelihood of employment, a greater number of working hours, and greater likelihood of working in a job with benefits. They also reduce disparities affecting Black jobseekers and workers. Western Maryland Consortium bases its ARPA programming on the work of Circles USA which has a 25 - year history of assisting to move people out of poverty. It has focused on direct poverty alleviation activities that meet the basic needs to address the cris is and on economic and workforce development solutions that are critical for any poverty alleviation effort to succeed. Worksource Montgomery (WSM) The Youth Employment Program is allocated toward evidence- based interventions. WSM supports evidence- based apprenticeship and pre - apprenticeship expansion efforts.

The pandemic illuminated the importance of broadband to access telemedicine, online education, and government services. The O ffice of Statewide Broadband (OSB) was established by Senate Bill (SB66), the Digital Connectivity Act of 2021, and signed into law (CH74) in April 2021. Connect Maryland is a transformative initiative to supercharge the State of Maryland's broadband investment with a total new investment of $400 million to fully address the digital divide. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 126 State of Maryland The State of Maryland has set an ambitious goal of ensuring universal broadband to everyone in every single corner of the state by no later than 2025. Di gital Equity programs focus on prioritizing \"covered populations\" / communities who are most in need: households with income less than or equal to 200 percent of federal poverty level aging individuals individuals with disabilities individuals with a language barrier including English learners or low levels of literacy minority populations rural populations This SLFRF project provides Broadband Services through five (5) subprojects. Each subproject supports the others to for m an integrated solution : Department of Housing and Community Development - Disadvantaged Marylanders Subsidy 2I.2 - Broadband - Gap Networks: June 2022 - December 31, 2023 2I.4 - Broadband - Device Subsidy: August 2022 - March 2023 2I.5 - Broadband - Service Subsidy: April 2022 - December 2023 (or until funds are exhausted) University of Maryland Extension - Digital Literacy and Education to Bridge the Digital Divide 2I.1 - Broadband - Digital Navigators 2I.3 - Broadband - Tech Exte nsion The Department of Housing and Community Development supplies the device and service subsidies, and then the University of Maryland Extension teaches Marylanders how to use them and provides help desk support. For example, the state provides a Chrome Book to a family living in poverty with no digital literacy. They can attend training to learn how to access the internet, access remote school resources for their children, learn how to access telemedicine, and learn how to fill out forms online. \"Digital literacy is an important part of our digital inclusion efforts,\" said Kenrick Gordon, Director of Statewide Broadband at the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development. \"Without providing a firm understanding of how to access the int ernet and what it can be used for, we will fail in our efforts to ensure that all Marylanders have access to, understand and are able to utilize broadband.\" \"The digital divide disproportionately affects Marylander's learning, work, access to service, civic engagement, and living. We are seeing some of the lowest subscription percentages in urban areas like Baltimore City and rural communities.\" said Jim Hanson, professor and associate dean/director for UME. \"There are also low levels of digital literacy w ith many individuals not seeing the means for connectivity. Through this generous funding from the state, we will mobilize a tech -education division to provide the training, support, and curriculum development to help increase adoption, understanding, and comfort.\" In July 2023, Governor Moore announced Maryland ActNow , a public awareness campaign to help increase awareness of and enrollment for discounted internet access for low -income households. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 127 State of Maryland 2I.1 -Broadband - Digital Navigators ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 2I.1 Broadband - Digital Navigators $2,000,000 $126,481 Less Than 50% Complete Digital Navigators engage Marylanders to assess technology skills gaps and guide them toward self-sustaining technology use. Engagement is made through multiple touch points, starting with the Marylanders Online website. The Digital Navigation Program provides the following services: Tech support in English, Spanish, and other languages upon request. Resources on affordable broadband internet options. Sources of affordable technology devices such as a computer, tablet, and other devices to access the Internet. Information on connecting to Wi- Fi/wireless networks using a device to access the Internet. Basic computer skills. Support on the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) application and enrollment. Technical support and training of staff for community organizations, local government, and libraries in setting up ACP sign up events; and Referral to digital resources to meet additional needs in education, employment, services, healthcare, and digital literacy. Raising awareness about ACP through our Call Center, partnership network, and community events. Project Activities In FY 23, the Digital Navigators project completed a mapping of asset s available in Maryland to understand the baseline for their work and to establish a knowledge base of available resources. This work was evidence based, using models developed by the National Digital Inclusion Alliance . The knowledge base is used by digital navigators to direct Marylanders when they call in to the Marylanders Online Call Center. It now contains close to 300 locally available resources, including libraries, senior centers, non-profit organizations, workforce development offices, and more. The Marylanders Online Call Center launched in February 2023 and provides help desk support to all Maryland residents. Issues include software, hardware, affordab ility, and digital skills training. The National Digital Inclusion Alliance provided training to the Digital Navigators and the team developed tutorials for various help desk issues. The call center has provided assistance to about 104 calls from 88 unique callers, offering support and guidance. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 128 State of Maryland Community Engagement Lack of awareness has been a significant hurdle, as many people are unaware of the program's existence or benefits. Trust has also been a factor, with individuals skeptical that the program is truly free. Poor customer service from Internet Service Providers has been a major barrier, with long wait times to speak to agents and discrepancies in billing causing frustration. Additionally, some individuals who have not previously used computers may not see the value in getting home internet and instead prefer discounts towards wireless services. Accessibility remains an issue, particularly in rural or remote areas where infrastructure limitations hinder reliable internet access. The digital literacy gap poses another challenge, as limited skills in utilizing digital technologies hinder the effective use of affordable connectivity options. It is worth noting that applying for the internet discount may automatically cancel existing Lifeline phone services, which further complicates matters. To raise awareness and promote affordable connectivity, the Digital Navigation program organizes and supports community events. These e vents serve as platforms to educate residents of Maryland about the importance of internet access and the resources available to them. The program also extends its support to organizations by offering consultation services, empowering them to host ACP sign-up events within their communities. By engaging in these awareness programs, the program aims to enhance digital inclusion and ensure that residents have the knowledge and access they need to connect to the internet and its benefits. We have participated in approximately 26 community and ACP events, both online and offline, reaching around 1,203 households. Furthermore, we have attended three conferences where we presented the services provided by the Digital Navigation program, highlighting opportunities for collaboration to enhance digital inclusion, particularly for historically marginalized communities. To further disseminate information and raise awareness, we have distributed approximately 2,500 flyers at events, while also sharing digital copies with our extensive partnership network of around 377 individuals. Our monthly newsletter, which started in January 2023, reaches around 320 subscribers, and serves as a platform for sharing project updates and event details. Equity Related Activities As pa rt of our efforts, we are actively working towards establishing the Maryland Digital Equity Coalition (MDEC). This coalition aims to bring together organizations across Maryland to facilitate information sharing, exchange experiences, and develop best prac tices in bridging the digital divide through digital navigation and digital skills education. By creating a support system, MDEC will empower digital navigators, educators, and leaders throughout the state to collectively address the challenges of digital equity and inclusion. For example, we have made an impact on immigrant populations and people with disabilities through our outreach programs: 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 129 State of Maryland Assistive/Adaptive Technology Devices Support To extend digital inclusivity to everyone in the community, the Digital Navigation Program is collaborating with Maryland Accessible Telecommunications (MAT) to design training materials on assistive technology devices for visually impaired. Assistive technology is equipment and software created to help people with disabilities or limitations perform daily tasks, become more independent, and improve their quality of life. We aim to provide support to individuals with disabilities by training Digital Navigation program team members, particularly our digital navigators, with devices that are used specifically for users with disabilities. We are also developing training material to provide support for MAT employees and other community members who are serving people with disabilities. University of Maryland E xtension is in the early planning stages to host an Accessibility Summit in the fall. The Summit will bring together experts, professionals, advocates, and individuals with disabilities to discuss, share knowledge, and collaborate on topics related to accessibility. Immigrant Communities American Diversity Group The American Diversity Group's mission is to bring together diverse groups of people to build and sustain healthy communities and enrich lives. They provide free medical clinics, weight loss management, diabetes management programs, cultural entertainment, food, etc. to over 100+ refugees and other underserved populations in Montgomery County. We coordinated and planned assistance with ACP applications and digital skills training programs for this organization, which will be provided by Montgomery Connects. Ethiopian/Eritrean Immigrant Communities As part of our efforts to ensure equal access to our services, we continue to conduct outreach and information sessions among diverse immigrant communities in Maryland. Following several meetings with staff and leadership of the Debre Selam Medhane Alem Eritrean Orthodox Tewahdo Church, in Prince George's County we participated at their 1st Annual Career Workshop on June 24, 2023. UME distributed a total of 600 (six hundred) promotion materials containing information about the services provided by the Digital Navigation program. ACP in Baltimore City and Rural Counties Through our partnership with the Housing Authority of Baltimore City (HABC), we provided assistance at ACP sign -up events located at public housing sites across Baltimore City. A total of 124 households received their ACP benefit, meaning that their ACP application was approved. It is important to note, however, that the households with approved ACP applications will then have to be connected with an Internet Service Provider (ISP) in order to receive the monthly subsidy to cover their internet cost. This is one of the areas where there may be a disconnect between gettin g ACP application approval and actual application of the subsidy to the recipient's monthly bill. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 130 State of Maryland The Digital Navigation program team and the Tech Extension educator covering the Southern Cluster also supported St. Mary's County's device distribution event where they provided 1006 households information about the ACP program and the required application process. We were able to support 69 households to receive their ACP benefit at the same event. In addition, our digital navigators and the Tech Extension Educator assisted those who received Chromebook devices with initial account setup, creating email, navigating the devices and distributed flyers for ongoing tech support. Similarly, our team of digital navigators and Tech Extension Educator participated a t the device distribution event organized by Charles County Public Library where they assisted 17 households with ACP qualification and enrollment. All 17 households received ACP application approval at the same event.

Implement sustainability and succession planning \u2014 preparation of a final report. Call center hours are 10am to 8pm weekdays and Saturdays from 10am to 5pm. Project Website The Marylanders Online website is -https://marylandersonline.umd.edu/ Individuals can also receive assistance through email at marylandersonline@umd.edu. Promoting Equitable Outcomes By offering various delivery mechanisms the digital navigation program strives to ensure individuals can access assistance in a way that suits their preferences and needs. These channels provide convenient and accessible avenues for individuals to seek guidance regarding their digital needs, whether it's connecting to affordable internet services, acquiring suitable devices, or obtaining support for digital skills. The program's commitment to offering diverse delivery mechanism s reinforces its goal of serving the community and empowering individuals to navigate the digital landscape effectively. Evaluation activities are tracking call center services and UME will disaggregate the data to determine the extent that project activities focus on Maryland residents who are senior adults, 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 131 State of Maryland have low income, have a language barrier (low literacy or English learner), are members of a racial or ethnic minoritized group, have disabilities, are from immigrant communities, or from rural communities or Baltimore City. UME is tracking the number of community events attended and community partners we have worked with and will examine the extent to which these activities provide services in high -need areas and/or with individuals facing digital gap s. Intended Outcomes A logic model and evaluation plan were developed, resulting in the following short- and intermediate -term outcomes: Increased digital inclusion: assist communities and individuals who face barriers to accessing broadband, suitable devices, Increased awareness of community members, organizations, and entities of available digital literacy resources in Maryland. Increased capacity of community organizations and entities to address digital literacy and access issues. Increased knowledge and skills of Maryland residents to enable them to get connected to the internet, access and use suitable devices, and complete everyday tasks. Use of Evidence Curricula have been developed and tailored to key audiences. For example, from the Senior Planet program from the American Association of Retired Persons, designed for older audiences. Tailoring our digital skills training for this audience is essential, as a recent study showed improvements in skills and feelings of loneliness among low-income older adults who received a device, internet, and training as compared to those who received only the device and internet. 22 And the NorthStar program, a standards-based program that was developed for adults, particularly to help job seeke rs gain digital literacy skills.

Developing and adapting curricula to teach digital literacy using various learning modes . 2. Delivering training and support for instructors and users: A train the trainer model is being used to teach the tech extension curricula to librarians, educators, and volunteers. 3. Curating an online digital literacy website to support all Marylanders with classes and resources. For example, self -service access to locate broadband services in their areas. 4. Deve loping a Digital Literacy Partnership Network by establishing collaboration between public libraries, workforce agencies, providers, schools, and other community organizations for networking and access to resources. Primary Delivery Mechanism and Partner s The University of Maryland Extension (UME) , Family and Consumer Sciences Program leads the tech extension project. UME has approximately 400 faculty and staff located at College Park; 23 counties; Baltimore City; and four research and education centers. UME is part of the Cooperative Extension System that has provided information and training for community members, businesses, and nonprofits about safely and effectively using online tools to improve their economic opportunities, access resources, and improve their quality of life. The Family and Consumer Sciences Program provides educational programs to improve the health and well -being of Maryland ers and trains health professionals, agency staff, human service providers, teachers, and other professionals. The Tech Extension project team currently consists of the project director, statewide team (curriculum and program specialists, technology experts, and program coordinator), and local Tech Extension Educators (located in Baltimore City and county offices/research centers). In addition, the project team is supported by Tech Extension Steering Committee, which has a representative from each of the four Extension programs to help define project goals and structures, provide input for program planning and implementation, strengthen the integration of digital literacy into existing UME programs and partnerships, and serve as advocates for the project. In addition, UME has developed collaborative partnerships with faculty and graduate students with expertise in information, technology, and digital literacy from the University of Maryland (UMD), especially with the College of Information Studies (UMD iSchool). Finally, we are working toward establishing an Advisory Group representing diverse expertise and backgrounds from key stakeholders. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 134 State of Maryland Project Activities and Timeline July 1, 2022 - December new project staff x x New staff training x Establish Advisory Group Establish Advisory Group x x Advisory Group meetings x x x x x Digital Literacy Curricula/Program Formative research and analysis x x x Develop curricula and pilot x x Revise curricula based on pilot data x x Adapt and translate x x x Launch of new digital literacy programs x x x Provide training and deliver the program x x x x x x Digital Literacy Training and Support Training of existing best -practice programs x x x x x x x x x Ongoing technical support and resources x x x x x x x x x x Tech Extension Website Develop web content, publish, and maintain x x x x x x x x x x Develop and maintain an online repository of best practice literacy resources x x x x x x x x x Launch of new online programs x x x x x x Social media and newsletters x x x x x x x x x x x Digital Literacy Partnerships Network Create Partnerships Network x x Host Digital Literacy Summit x x x Host Network meetings x x x x x Evaluation, Sustainability and Succession Conduct in depth program evaluation and prepare a final report. x x x x Implement sustainability and succession planning x x x x Promoting Equitable Outcomes The website is designed to serve the many diverse communities in Maryland that are most affected by the digital divide. For those needing help, groups that are particularly impacted include BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, People of Color), low -income households, those with low education, older adults, immigrants, individuals with limited English proficiency, and individuals with disabilities. There are also access barriers due to geographic location \u2014 especially in rural areas and Baltimore city - and the cost of devices and/or internet service. 135 2023 SLFRF Annual Report State of Maryland Community Engagement Creating a Digital Literacy Partnerships Network is a crucial element of the Tech Extension project. Partners who provide digital literacy programs in Maryland have been invited to share existing curricula and programs and have been encouraged to participate in collaborative initiatives. We are working with partners that serve the community, including state and local government agencies, University of Maryland Extens ion offices (covering all Maryland jurisdictions), community colleges, workforce agencies, senior centers, faith -based groups, and community organizations to help connect or incorporate digital literacy into existing services and programs. These partnershi ps will enhance learners' ability to apply digital skills in various practical settings such as applying for benefits, jobs seeking, health care, civic engagement, communicating with family members, completing everyday transactions, and more. Office of Statewide Broadband Conferences April 17, 2023 - University of Maryland, College Park: At this event, Dr. Jinhee Kim, Associate Dean of the University of Maryland Extension and Principal Investigator for the Extension project, participated in the panel discussion on Public and Nonprofit Perspectives: Needs and Successes. The panel addresses key questions related to identifying covered populations who can benefit from the BEAD and Digital Equity grants, as well as effective outreach and education best practices. The Director of the Tech Extension project, Mr. Isaias Tesfalidet, also led a breakout session on the Tech Extension technical support, digital literacy training and digital navigator services to an audience of community members, stakeholder organizati ons and representatives of local government.

Rural Maryland Council Symposium On June 21, 2023, Tech Extension Team members led a panel discussion on \"Digital Inclusion - Case Studies and Best Practices\" at the Regio nal Rural Broadband Forum in Annapolis organized by the Rural Maryland Council and USDA Rural Development. This session delved into important issues surrounding challenges and barriers faced by Maryland residents in getting access to broadband, the importance of establishing shared understanding of digital literacy skills, ongoing efforts in Maryland to promote digital inclusion, and the future prospects for realizing digital equity. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 136 State of Maryland Maryland Association of Public Library Administrators (MAPLA) Dr. Mega Subramaniam, the co -Principal Investigator of the Tech Extension project and lead for the Curriculum Team, along with Isaias Tesfalidet, the Project Director, delivered a presentation at the Maryland Association of Public Library Administrators (M APLA) on April 12, 2023. The presentation focused on the services provided by the Tech Extension project, emphasizing curriculum development and collaboration with libraries in digital skills training. The Tech Extension team engaged with the participants, who were library administrators, and received valuable feedback regarding outreach best practices, the specific needs of library patrons, and opportunities for training library staff to serve as digital navigators. Montgomery County Digital Equity Coali tion On April 20, 2023, the Tech Extension project director and Program Manager for the Digital Navigation program actively participated in a community and stakeholder engagement session organized by the Program Director for Montgomery Connects, a digital equity program in Montgomery County. The session brought together 77 participants, representing community members, various advocacy organizations, service delivery agencies, workforce development entities, and immigrant communities. The primary focus of the session was to discuss topics such as the digital equity needs of clients, curriculum requirements for clients and Montgomery County Digital Equity Coalition (MoCo- DEC) member organizations, and the role of a Navigator in assisting MoCo -DEC member organizations. Intended Outcomes An evaluation plan and logic model were developed to capture project activities and their intended outcomes. The long- term impact we hope to make is to increase Maryland residents' digital literacy skills and competency, increase ownership of digital devices, and increase home broadband digital access. Equity Related Outcomes The intended outcomes are focused on closing gaps in digital literacy and access. Project activities are being directed toward groups t hat face gaps in these areas. Evaluation activities are tracking services provided and we will disaggregate the data to determine the extent that project activities focus on Maryland residents who are senior adults, have low income, have a language barrier (low literacy or English learner), are members of a racial or ethnic minoritized group, have disabilities, are from immigrant communities, or from rural communities. Use of Evidence To ensure that all programming and activities undertaken by the Marylan ders Online project were in direct response to evidence of need specific to various Maryland resident populations the team undertook a Stakeholder Needs Assessment. This survey and interview -based study reached 196 stakeholders from across the state and the surrounding DMV region. The study was guided by two goals: Map the landscape of available digital literacy programming in the state of 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 137 State of Maryland Maryland; and determine the digital literacy needs that Marylanders have and the perceived barriers that contribute to why they are not being served. An executive summary of the findings was published. The findings from this study became the evidence-based grounding for the Digital Literacy Summit presented by the Marylanders Online team in October of 2022. During the summit a collaborative design thinking workshop was undertaken by attendees to expand upon the evidence collected during the Stakeholder Needs Assessment. The findings of this workshop were published.

The office has also met multiple times with local community organizations to better understand their needs and the impacts their programs have on the communities they serve. The digital equity programs have been designed to assist those communities directly. The Gap Networks program encourages partnerships and the following organizations to appl y: local government (Counties & Municipalities); or a foundation, corporation, institution, association, or coalition that is\u2014 (i) a not- for-profit IRS approved 501(c) entity and (ii) providing services within the State of Maryland; or a community based an chor institution; or other community based organizations As we emerge from the impacts of the pandemic, broadband adoption plays perhaps the most pressing role in internet accessibility. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 140 State of Maryland Equity Related Awareness, Access, and Distribution What often stands in the way of connectivity are roadblocks to broadband adoption, be it language barriers, lack of knowledge of available options, lack of a device capable of connection, privacy concerns and more. This is where community partners like internet servi ce providers (ISP) play an important role. They know and work directly with their constituents, having earned the trust of the people they serve. The office has partnered with multiple ISPs to bring awareness to Maryland's communities whether through maili ngs or video advertisements. Our programs are built to provide both an equitable and inclusive awareness to communities and those eligible households. The versatility of our awareness and access ensure that all possible measures of distribution are account ed for. For example, DHCD has worked with ISPs on providing advertisements online and on TV, and has partnered with local community organizations to post flyers in their facilities and multi-dwelling units. Equity Related Outcomes It is vital that all Marylanders experience the long -term benefits of internet capable technology using a sustainable approach across the state and at local levels. This outcome can be achieved by developing a measurable platform such as our \"digital equity scorecard\", enhancing upon the technological capacities of our community organizations, and collaborating and forming partnerships with key stakeholders. Use of Evidence Device Subsidy: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, approximately 287,000 Maryland households have neither a tablet nor a desktop/laptop computer. Some 200,000 are households whose annual incomes are below $50,000. The state assumed an approximate device cost of $150 to determine the total allotment ($150 x 200,000 households = $30 million). Service Fee Subsidy: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, in 2019 approximately 500,000 Maryland households qualified for the federal Lifeline program or the National School Lunch Program. The state is aiming to add ress a sizable portion of these households (at least half) and assumed an approximate service cost of $15 per month to determine the total allotment (250,000 households x $15 service fee x 12 months = $45 million). The combination of all the state's broadband projects will work toward addressing the issue for the full 500,000 households.

However, with almost 350,000 households qualifying for federal internet subsidy, our office will utilize this number as a hard target for participation. Maryland currently has 160,000 households participating in the federal program. Our goal is to have this at 80% by the end of 2023 through awareness campaigns. While the office will not track specific demographics (race, age, sex etc.) we utilize address level data with census track information to better understand end users.

In addition to placing a strain on the payout of benefits to struggling workers who are in need of unemployment benefits, depletion of the trust fund balance would have forced Maryland employers to face significant unemployment insurance tax increases in future years. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 144 State of Maryland 2021 SUI tax rates increased from lowest rate schedule to highest rate Rate Schedule F, the highest per law, was in effect for calendar year 2021. T he Relief Act ( SB 496/CH39) codified the 2021 SUI tax rates not be based on individual employer exper ience for fiscal year 2020. Although the computation of employer individual SUI tax rates did not take into account COVID-19 UI benefits for fiscal year 2020, the overall historic impact on the state's UI trust fund caused a significant increase in 2021 em ployer SUI tax rates. (See EY Tax Alert 2021-0427, 2-25-2021.) 24 The Maryland 2021 SUI tax rates ranged from 2.2% to 13.5% on Table F, up from 0.3% to 7.5% on Table A (the lowest rate schedule). Table A had been in effect for five consecutive years prior to 2021. The intent is to re- establish consistently lower rate tables. The 2021 Legislative Session ena cted emergency legislation ( SB 811/Chapter 73) requiring th e governor to deposit enough federal relief funds into the state's unemployment insurance (SUI) trust fund to ensure that Rate Schedule C, the midway point of SUI rate schedules under the state UI law, be in effect for calendar year 2022. The bill also requires that Rate Schedule C be used for the calendar year 2023. SUI tax rates on Rate Schedule C range from 1.0% to 10.5%. The law require d the governor to include in the fiscal year 2022 annual budget bill an appropriation of federal American Rescue Plan (ARP) funds sufficient to replenish the SUI trust fund to the point resulting in Table C for calendar 2022. The appropriation may also be used for administrative costs, including the repayment of the federal unemployment insurance (UI) loan balance. An estimated $1.1 billion in federal funds would need to be allocated to the UI trust fund to accomplish this goal. (SB 811 fiscal note). According to the federal Treasury Direct website, as of September 27, 2021, Maryland paid off its federal UI loan balance by using ARP funding as allowed under SB 811. It avoided the federal unemployment insurance tax (FUTA) credit reduction that was set t o trigger in 2022.

Lift property values to build wealth for new and existing homeowners. HOW will show the importance of targeted homeownership investment to the creation of wealth for formerly marginalized and pandemic -impacted populations. And, HOW will create new tools at the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) - such as for predevelopment and construction financing to create affordable homeownership - to enable sustained investment in communities whose residents have faced significant economic challenges from the pandemic in addition to historic disinvestment. Project Activities New homeownership opportunities: In the urban community of Johnston Square in Baltimore City, HOW will stabilize and rehabilitate at least 30 vacant homes to become affordable 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 146 State of Maryland homeownership opportunities. In the rural community of the Pine Street Historic District in the City of Cambridge will build at least 12 new homes as infill on formerly vacant lots to become affordable homeownership opportunities. Rehab and repairs for existing homeowners: In both communities at least 15 existing homeowner househol ds will receive support for critical repairs; and at least 10 will receive support for exterior facade improvements. Homeownership counseling and legal services: DHCD is coordinating with local nonprofit partners to create a pipeline of well -prepared new homebuyers for the new affordable housing units. In addition, DHCD will continue to fund legal services for existing households that have \"tangled titles\"/ estates to remove barriers to accessing support for critical repairs. Equity Related Activities The HOW pilot is focused entirely on targeted homeownership in two historic African American communities with depressed property values. The overarching goal of HOW is to strengthen these housing markets through blight elimination and concentrated homeowne rship investment to increase equity and wealth for new homebuyers of color as well as for existing homeowners of color. Community Engagement Related Activities The HOW pilot has been informed by substantial consultation with nonprofit leaders, local gove rnment leaders, private -sector development leaders and local community leaders. In the Spring of 2021, DHCD staff conducted interviews with ~40 stakeholders before designing the concept for what became the HOW pilot; this research resulted in an internal r eport entitled \"Housing Acquisition and Rehabilitation: Opportunities for Maryland's Community Revitalization Toolbox.\" Prior to deploying the awarded HOW funding, DHCD's CDA appointed a special project leader to refine the deployment of HOW funding and related funding; the CDA project leader subsequently conducted interviews, meetings, and site visits. Timeline January 2022 through June 2022 - Coordination with local partners to create investment plans, roles, and grant agreements. Workshops for existing homeowners interested in assistance with critical repairs and facade improvements. July 2022 through December 2022: Obligation of approximately $5 million in HOW funding for rehabilitation and construction for new homeownership opportunities. Obligation of approximately $1million for critical repairs and facade improvements for existing homeowners. Creation of pipeline of new homebuyers through housing counseling. January 2023 through June 2023: Obligation of remaining $3 million in HOW funding for remaining activities. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 147 State of Maryland Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners Johnston Square, Baltimore City: DHCD's principal partner is the nonprofit Rebuild Metro Baltimore which is working in close partnership with the grassroots Rebuild Johnston Square community a ssociation. Rebuild Metro will be the recipient of HOW grant awards to support pre-development work including the stabilization of vacant properties for rehabilitation for homeownership, and for residential facade improvements to help bring existing homeow ners along as the blocks improve. DHCD's special loans team will use HOW funding to support interior improvements for legacy homeowners in the area, and the CDA team will use HOW funding to support construction of the new homes. Pine Street, Cambridge: D HCD has two principal partners - City of Cambridge and Habitat Choptank. The city will focus HOW funding on recruitment of a Developer for new infill construction, and Habitat will focus on both infill and rehab activities using their sweat equity model. Equity Related Awareness, Access, and Distribution Because the HOW pilot is focused on residential investment in two specific historic African American communities, DHCD has provided extensive outreach to residents through a variety of trusted and practic al channels. In Cambridge, equitable awareness of the HOW program has been accomplished through: City council hearings and community meetings. In Johnston Square, equitable awareness of the HOW program has been accomplished through trainings with Johnston Square block captains and community meetings. Intended Outcomes Overarching Outcomes Increased home values to increase wealth of households of color Decreased residential vacancies and increased housing quality as a means of neighborhood revitalization and safety. Outputs to Achieve Outcomes Number of units of rehabilitated housing: At least 30 in Johnston Square/Baltimore City. Number of units of new infill housing: At least 12 in Pine Street/Cambridge. Number of home buyers provided counseling: At least 50. Number of homeowners provided \"tangled title\" services: At least 10 Disbursement of all funds by December 31, 2021 Equity Related Outcomes The entire allocation of HOW pilot funding is targeted to achieve and strengthen affordable homeownership in two traditionally marginalized low-income communities. The outcomes described above are entirely focused on achieving wealth building for households of color in these two communities. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 148 State of Maryland One challenge to project success is creating a pipelin e of ready homebuyers; previous experience in working with local renters in both target communities portends challenges with sufficient income and credit health. Use of Evidence Numerous studies have shown that homeownership has been a traditional source of wealth for low and moderate-income households. However, homeownership levels of people of color have lagged the majority population. In addition, people of color have been historically segregated by redlining and other systemic factors in neighborhoods with homes of lower value. A 2018 study by the Brookings Institution determined that homes in majority Black neighborhoods are undervalued by $48,000 on average when compared to homes of similar quality in neighborhoods with similar amenities but with very few or no Black residents. Targeted concentrated investment in new homeownership and strengthening existing homeownership is an evidence-based approach to both increasing household wealth and strengthening overall neighborhood home values. Performance Report Overarching Outcomes: Increased home values to increase wealth of households of color Decreased residential vacancies and increased housing quality as a means of neighborhood revitalization and safety. Outputs to Achieve Outcomes: Numb er of units of rehabilitated housing: At least 30 in Johnston Square/Baltimore City. Number of units of new infill housing: At least 12 in Pine Street/Cambridge. Number of legacy homeowner improvements: At least 30 across both sites Number of residential e xterior and facade improvements: At least 30 across both sites Number of home buyers provided counseling: At least 50. Number of homeowners provided \"tangled title\" services: At least 10 American Rescue Plan Support Outside of SLFRF Outside of SLFRF, the Homeowner Assistance Fund was established by the American Rescue Plan enacted on March 11, 2021, to help homeowners experiencing financial hardship after January 21, 2020. The Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) will receive $248 million through this program over three years to assist homeowners struggling with their mortgage payments or other housing costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Homeowner Assistance Fund Data Dashboard includes performance measures on the count and amount of applications, grants and loans approved, demographic information on applicants, and customer service measures. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 149 State of Maryland 2M - K-12 Academic Services Project ID 2M Project Name K-12 Academic Services Subprojects 6 Budget $269,514,657 Expenditures $194,991,442 Status More Than 50% Complete Expenditure Category 2.25 -Assistance to Households: Addressing Educational Disparities: Academic, Social, and Emotional Services Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 2M.1 Recovery Now -Juvenile Services Education $938,839 $938,839 Completed 2M.2 Student Support Network $1,000,000 $275,747 Less Than 50% Complete 2M.3 Summer School $50,000,000 $46,150,737 More Than 50% Complete 2M.4 Transitional Supplemental Instruction $20,000,000 $13,672,243 More Than 50% Complete 2M.5 Transitional Supplemental Instruction -Blueprint Fund $46,000,000 $46,000,000 Completed 2M.6 Tutoring and Supplemental Instruction $151,575,818 $87,953,876 More Than 50% Complete Project Description Maryland received more than $3 billion in pandemic relief for education.

The program supports students in 21 district schools. Project Activities SLFRF funds may be used to: Support operating expenses related to program delivery; Purchase materials and supplies to support student engagement in programming; Support transportation costs for students and advisors participating in programming; Provide services for students related to participation in the Student Support Network; and Operating costs of the organization. Funds may not be used for construction of temporary or permanent structures. Key strategies for executing ongoing services include: 1. Operating \"Rooms of Support\": This involves frequent communications with school staff and assigned volunteers, the order, storage, and delivery of requested items by schools, the collection and analysis of data from Rooms of Support personnel, and the fulf illment of special requests for students. These tasks, primarily overseen by the program coordinator, ensure the continuous availability of necessary items and foster shared responsibility between the Network and partner schools to meet student needs. 2. Vo lunteer Training and Engagement: The program carries out l ead volunteer training sessions each August/September of the grant period and provides additional training for new volunteers throughout the year. These strategies set clear expectations, empower volunteers, and create shared accountability between the Network and its volunteers. 3. External Communications: To raise public awareness of the work, the program conducts regular communications with social media followers and email subscribers. This includes social media posts 1 -3 times per week, monthly e- newsletters, website updates, and media pitches. These activities, primarily managed by the e xecutive director, enhance the success of the Network by informing the public about student needs, volunteer, dona tion, and advocacy opportunities for students living in poverty. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 152 State of Maryland Grant funds facilitate these strategies, covering staff salaries and purchasing necessary goods or services. Key strategies for initiating new services: Outreach to administrators of schools on the waiting list and meetings to select the neediest candidate s for partnership. Recruitment of volunteers to staff Rooms of Support at new schools. Communication of opportunities for food and other item distributions to non- Network school administrators and arranging subsequent service meetings. Timeline The grant program was released on July 8, 2022. Grant applications were due on August 5, 2022. The period of performance is from July 1, 2022 - September 30, 2023. Use of Evidence The grant program focuses on improving the educational and social outcomes of students from food insecure households. Research reveals these students exhibit marginal advancements in mathematics and reading scores while also experiencing a decline in social skills compared to their peers from food secure homes. The approach to tackling student hunger is guided by Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, a renowned model used in psychology and social work that highlights the hindrance unmet basic needs pose to individuals' self-actualization. The program prioritizes satisfying students' physiological needs such as food and clothing, the foundation of Maslow's pyramid, and then addresses their safety needs by providing school supplies and a reliable source of nutrition, thereby fostering a sense of order and control in students' lives. To further empower the students, the program integrates research- based theories recommended by the U.S. Department of Education to assist individuals out of poverty, with a specific focus on Asset Theory, which centers on understanding and providing the resources students require and establishing community partnerships.

The Blueprint for Maryland's Future Transitional Supplemental Instruction State Aid program was an ambitious, state -sponsored initiative designed to tackle academic achievement gaps and enhance the quality of education across Maryland's K -12 public schools. It focused on providing supplemental instruction to students who needed additional academic support, particularly those transitioning between different educational levels or facing learning loss due to the impacts of the pandemic. This targeted program utilized funds to create and implement high -quality instructional opportunities outside of the standard classroom environment. This included after-school, weekend, and summer tutoring sessions, both in-person and online, thus ensuring students could access help whenever needed. The program was designed to cater to the unique educational requirements of each student, prioritizing personalized learning plans to address specific areas of academic need. In addition to academic support, the Blueprint program also emphasized collaboration with local government and nonprofit organizations, demonstrating a holistic approach to student success. Through these partnerships, the program ensured that transportation and other necessary resources were available to all participating students, reducing barriers to access. The program's success was evaluated annually through comprehensive assessments to ensure ongoing improvement and adaptability, emphasizing Maryland's commitment to high -quality, equitable education for all students. Project Activities Under the Blueprint for Maryland's Future Transitional Supplemental Instruction State Aid program, there are several defined activities that are allowable according to the law. These activities focus on improving student achievement, particularly for students who are at risk of falling behind or who have been identified as having suffered learning loss. Tutoring and Remedial Support: Schools can implement individual or small-group tutoring programs, including those that take place after school hours or on weekends. This could also include remediation classes that focus on key subject areas where st udents might be struggling. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 158 State of Maryland 1. Extended Learning Opportunities: This might involve the creation of after-school programs, summer learning programs, or other extended learning opportunities. The aim is to provide students with additional instructional time outside the typical school day. 2. Instructional Materials and Resources: Funding can be used to purchase additional resources and materials to support the supplemental instruction. This might include textbooks, digital learning resources, or other educational materials. 3. Personnel Costs: Funds can be used to pay for the additional personnel required to implement these programs, including teacher salaries, stipends for after -hours work, and costs for additional support staff. 4. Collaborative Efforts: Schools are encouraged to collaborate with local government and nonprofit organizations to provide additional services or support to students. This might include transportation services, meal programs, or access to other resources. 5. Evaluation and Monitoring: The law allows for regular assessment of students' progress, to monitor the effectiveness of the supplemental instruction. It also permits the evaluation of the program overall to ensure it is delivering the expected improvements in student outcomes. 6. Professional Development: The program can cover the costs of professional development for educators, helping them effectively implement transitional supplemental instruction and utilize best practices for supporting student success. Each of these activities is desig ned to offer additional support to students, particularly those transitioning between school levels, to ensure they have the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed.

Implemented in accordance with th e unique needs of each district, the program emphasized the use of personalized instruction, which included both in-person and virtual tutoring sessions, along with supplemental instruction for students in grades 4- 12. Varied in its implementation, the program included after -school tutoring sessions, extended day programs, on-demand virtual support, and mentorship opportunities. Each district tailored the program to its unique needs - some focused on specific subjects, such as reading/language arts and math, while others emphasized mental health support. Districts were required to provide transportation and meals when necessary, demonstrating a commitment to ensuring all students could access these resources. Districts used a range of data, including MAP scores, Lexia data, Dreambox data, and student grades, to identify eligible students for tutoring and supplemental instruction. Moreover, diagnostic assessments were frequently utilized to monitor student progress and evaluate the effectiveness of the tutor ing program. The initiative marked a considerable investment in both educators, through salaries and professional development opportunities, and students, offering an enhanced educational environment to counter the learning loss brought on by the pandemic.

Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have been linked to an increased risk of poor educational, behavioral, economic, and physical health outcomes. The Boys and Girls Clubs provide evidence-based youth development programs, mentoring and other educational enrichment activities rooted in positive youth development. In addition to providing the time -tested Club model, the Alliance deployed resources, training, and support for youths and their families. The Clubs provide expanded services to communities that lack universal access to effective youth development programs. This will support the well-being of youth and wi ll continue to link in -school and out-of-school time for Maryland's youth by collaborating with 15 communities. Equity Related Activities Youth Behavioral Risk Survey (YRBS) data and robust input from stakeholders identify communities where \"youth that need us most\" are present. Social factors that fall into four main categories include poverty levels, household capacity, transportation access and the prevalence of minorities for whom English is a second language. Significant pockets of high vulnerability have been identified in targeted clubs. Community Engagement Related Activities Through the intuitive technology solutions offered in various platforms, there will be an ability to leverage remote learning opportunities, integrate state data sources, and use intelligent interactions to each user that is secure and accessible at the point of need. One of the goals is to expand pop- up community programs that are mobile in nature and resilience focused to offer summer camps for educational enhancement. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners The Alliance will digitize manual paper-based workflows enabling insight into membership and speeding time to service time to outcome; deploy learning platform with appropriate engagement framework; connect stakeholders through a care team approach of collaboration; provide individualized learning tools; generate local and state-level dashboards to inform policy; and create an evidence- based framework for program measurement for 15 Maryland's communities with 23 jurisdictions and Baltimore City. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 166 State of Maryland Intended Outcomes Support 5,000 youth through the expansion of SMART Moves: Emotional Wellness Engage up to 15 communities to expand access to clubs in Maryland Expand clubs to an additional 20 community outreach locations Conduct summer programs and provide scholarship opportunities for 5,000 youth Host trauma -response training for youth development staff members annually Grow the reach of social- emotional wellness programs to support counties in Maryland.

The Maryland General Assembly approved the Maryland Health Equity Resources Act during the 2021 legislative session. The bill outlines the designation of HERCs, and includes five (5) policy objectives: 1. Reduce health disparities 2. Improve health outcomes 3. Improve ac cess to primary care 4. Promote primary and secondary prevention services 5. Reduce health care costs, hospital admissions and readmissions. The HERC Advisory Committee is responsible for program implementation, program evaluation and data collection metrics, preparation of an annual report on the program, and development of strategies for tax incentives and loan repayments to assist HERCs in achieving their mission. Resource allocation is determined by the HERC Advisory Committee managed by the Maryland Community Health Resources Commission (CHRC). The CHRC is responsible for establishing a Pathways to Health Equity Program to ensure the long- term viability of the HERC program. Grant funding for Pathways to Health Equity to specified entities is provided through this program and must be for two years. Special consideration must be given to proposals from areas previously designated as Health Enterprise Zones (HEZs). Project Activities, Timeline, and Community Engagement The Governor's Office, the Senate President, and the Speaker of the House made appointments to the HERC Advisory Committee on July 12, 2021. The CHRC held its first meeting of the HERC Advisory Committee on August 11, 2021. Three (3)advisory subcommittees were appointed, including the Consumer Outreach and Community Engagement Subcommittee, Pathways Call for Proposals and Design Subcommittee, and the Data and Program Evaluation Subcommittee. (All HERC Committee and Subcommittee meetings are available to the public, live and online.) 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 168 State of Maryland Substantive work to prepare and release the Pathways to Health Equity request for proposals (RFP) ensued, Laying the Foundation for the Health Equity Resource Community Initiative. The RFP was release on -time, October 12, 2021 The HERC Consumer Outre ach and Community Engagement Subcommittee then hosted 14 meetings across the state in October 2021 to inform communities and potential applicants about the Pathways to Health Equity RFP. Every region in the state had an in-person and online meeting. Nonpr ofit community -based organizations, nonprofit hospitals, federally qualified health centers (FQHC), institutions of higher education, and local government agencies may receive the HERC designation if they apply to CHRC on behalf of the area. The application must include community -based organizations to provide health and support services within the HERC and will outline practices for community engagement and outreach. This resulted in forty (40) applications received to the RFP, requesting $42.3 million ($ 13.5 million available to award). Applications were due December 7, 2021. On February 15, 2022, the CHRC voted to award 9 grantees under the new \"Pathways to Hea lth Equity\" program, investing $13.5 million in new resources in underserved communities throughout the state . Specific health disparities targeted by the new projects include diabetes, asthma, heart disease and hypertension, mental health, substance use disorder, maternal and child health, and Sickle Cell Disease. Implementation of the nine (9) Pathways projects initiated in the Spring of 2022, and all projects are underway. Intended Outcomes Reduce health disparities Improve outcomes, including reduced cancer, heart disease and infant mortality rates Improve access to primary care Promote primary and secondary prevention services Reduce health care costs Use of Evidence A broad body of research has shown that health disparities exist between Black, Hispanic and Native American individuals and their white counterparts. This can be seen in data comparing rates of heart disease, stroke, infant mortality, maternal mortality, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cancers, respiratory diseases and autoimmune diseases by race and ethnicity. COVID - 19 infection data also shows racial disparity. For example: While Black individuals comprise 29.8% of the Maryland population, they represented 36% of COVID-19 deaths as of January 18, 2021. Maryland's maternal mortality rate for Black women is 3.7 times that of White women, and the racial disparity has widened in recent years. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 169 State of Maryland Develop Standardized and Customized Data Measures With the support of the HERC Advisory Data and Program Evaluation Subcommittee and the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients (CRISP), CHRC developed standardized process (output) and outcome measures for reporting, with additional customi zed measures developed to capture and report grant specific services and activities. All measures have been selected to measure project impact and to assess the effectiveness of key project interventions toward achieving the five policy objectives of the Maryland Health Equity Resources Act. From April 2022 to September 2022, the CHRC held meetings with each Pathways grantee to finalize the proposed data measures. Each Pathways grantee is also required to engage the services of an Evaluator to analyze the data collected through the end of the two- year grant period for submission in a final evaluation report to the CHRC due by July 2024. Technical and Programmatic Assistance Since May 2022, the CHRC with the support of the HERC Data Subcommittee and CRIS P has conducted joint Technical Assistance (TA) meetings. These meetings were initially held every 2 - 4 weeks, and now occur less frequently since all projects are fully implemented and delivering services. The TA meetings address common topics among grantees, questions related to implementation of key project services, technical guidance in areas such as data collection and evaluation, and CHRC grant reporting requirements. In tandem with the Technical Assistance meetings, CHRC staff with the support of the HERC Advisory Committee holds monthly one-on- one project status review calls with each grantee. These calls were initiated in July 2022, and are ongoing. CHRC staff receives regular updates on key project staffing, the status of project implementation a nd delivery of services and project enrollment, and the opportunity to provide guidance to grantees that address challenges encountered such as slower than expected recruitment of participants in their target service communities. Performance Reporting The CHRC requires that all Pathways grantees submit quarterly narrative and bi- annual data reports to assess the delivery of funded project services and to monitor progress toward achieving the intended recruitment and service targets. When indicated, gra ntees are requested to define corrective actions to address specific implementation and/or service concerns. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 170 State of Maryland Public Sector Capacity Expenditure Group 3 is Public Sector Capacity.

Eligible employee claims included professional services, inpatient and outpatient hospital charges, lab, radiology, emergency room, testing kits, vaccines and antiviral medications. The state offers employees five health insurance plans administered through three carrier partners, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, Kaiser Permanente, and United HealthCare. Health care provides submitted claims to the elected health plan on behalf of plan participants. 199,889 unique participants have had at least one claim paid for a COVID -19 related service between March 3, 2021, and June 15, 2022, for dates of service through May 31, 2022. 118,144 unique patients have received vaccines through our prescription drug vendor, CVS Caremark. An additiona l 6,058 unique patients filled antiviral medication or purchased testing kits. Statistics include those with both a medical claim and prescription claim. Claim data is captured in real time for the period March 3, 2021, through June 15, 2022. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 173 State of Maryland 3A.2 -Overtime for the Office of Chief Medical Examiner ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 3A.2 Overtime for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner $100,000 $100,000 Completed This project provide d financial assistance to cover a portion of overtime for the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). The OCME caseload increased in FY21 by 1 1% over the previous fiscal year to 18,600 cases, and 22% over the past two years. COVID- 19 cases were a facto r in this increase, on top of a longer- term increase in opioid deaths. The OCME is required to investigate deaths that are sudden and unexpected, result from injury, occur under unexplained or suspicious circumstances, or when a person is not attended by a physician. SLFRF supported OCME employees who are entitled to receive cash for overtime worked to meet the additional demand. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 174 State of Maryland 3A.3 -Public Safety Salaries ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 3A.3 Public Safety Salaries $250,000,000 $250,000,000 Completed The Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) utilized SLFRF t o fund salary expenses for 4,957 correctional officers (public safety) from July 1, 2021 - June 30, 2022. Recruiting and retaining the state's public safety workers at Maryland's nineteen (19) correctional institutions is mission critical. Recipients of this funding were required to work within the confines of a correctional facility and were directly responsible for the custody of inmates. By nature of their work, the recipients of the funding were frequently in close contact with inmates who have tested positive and were quarantined, as well as in close contact with other correctional staff while havi ng no ability to maintain social distancing within correctional facilities that have poor ventilation. In July 2021, $13 million in salary increases were announced for employees who are charged with the care and custody of inmates within Maryland's correc tional facilities . Salary enhancements are designed to enhance the state's ability to compete in an area that has seen recruitment challenges despite many innovative efforts to hire correctional officers . The state was able to reach agreement with the exclusive representative of these employees, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees within a very short period. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 175 State of Maryland 3B - K-12 Emotional and Behavioral Services Project ID 3B Project Name K-12 Emotional and Behavioral Services Subprojects 1 Budget $25,000,000 Expenditures $14,338,742 Status More Than 50% Complete Expenditure Category 3.4 - Public Sector Capacity: Effective Service Delivery Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 3B.1 Behavioral Health and Trauma Services $25,000,000 $14,338,742 More Than 50% Complete Project Description The Blueprint is a landmark piece of legislation that was passed to provide comprehensive changes to Maryland's early childhood and public schools. House Bill 1372 was passed to update and complement the core legislation, House Bill 1300, and enacted under Article II, \u00a7 17(b) of the Maryland Constitution on April 9, 2021. It includes the following provision: \"Each county board of education, including Baltimore City, shall use state and federal funds provided for COVID-19 relief in the state budget for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 to address trauma and behavioral health issues exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic on students and their families to identify and provide necessary supports and services for students.\" By January 1, 2022, schools boards were required to publish a report describing how they: 1. provided behavioral health services to students; 2. ensured that services provided to students address the trauma and behavioral health issues due to the effects of exacerbated by the COVID -19 pandemic; and 3. monitored students experiencing trauma and behavioral health issues 4. measured the effectiveness and impact of behavioral health services provided to students using key metrics and procedures. The Maryland Department of Legislative Services (DLS) Library contains the plans and performance reports. On the DLS Library, perform a keyword search for 'HB 1372' . 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 176 State of Maryland Timeline Maryland's 24 Local Education Agencies (LEAs) received grants. Grant funds are available to the LEAs until 12/30/2024. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners To the extent practicable, LEAs are encouraged to utilize school-based health centers to coordinate and deliver services to students. LEAs may use grant funds to train teachers and school staff to recognize signs of student trauma or behavioral health concerns. LEAs use d the funds to support social- emotional learning programming and materials, counseling services for students, staff and families, establishing or enhancing restorative practices programs, additional school -based guidance counselors, behavioral therapists, and school-based social workers. LEAs report expenditures on a monthly basis which are reimbursed by the state. Community Engagement Related Activities County Boards of Education facilitate community engagement through a number of avenues, including regular Board meetings, community surveys, and stakeholder engagement activities. Equity Related Activities Funds were distributed based on each LEA's proportionate share of the State's Foundation Program under the Major State Education Aid funding. State aid i n Maryland is wealth -equalized meaning that less wealthy jurisdictions receive a larger share of state aid than more wealthy jurisdictions. By nature of the calculation, more funds under this program are distributed to low-income jurisdictions. Prioritizin g equity, the Blueprint prescribes new programs and innovative approaches to catalyze a world -renowned education system that aims to eradicate achievement gaps and ensures opportunity for every student, regardless of family income, race, ethnicity, and/or ability. Performance The Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE) has successfully completed the administration and collection of S LFRF spending data across four fiscal years, spanning from 2020 to 2023. The Department worked closely with local education agencies (LEAs) across the state, ensuring the accurate collection and recording of all relevant financial information. The process allowed MSDE to track the disbursement and utilization of these crucial funds in an organized and accountable manner. MSDE is currently in the process of finalizing the reconciliation of these data, a procedure that involves verifying the reported spending aga inst the actual expenditure. Once this process is complete, MSDE will then proceed with the collection of the next year's cumulative reporting data in December 2023. This ongoing effort reflects MSDE's commitment to accountability, transparency, and continuous improvement. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 177 State of Maryland Early Insights Initial data provide insight into program implementation and service delivery. In Baltimore City Schools, for example, the district used SLFRF trauma and behavioral health funding to offer expanded school behavioral health programs. Between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 the district held nearly 16,000 consultations (see Table, below). Activity Count Number of Teacher and Classroom Consultations 15,936 Number of Family Outreach Activities 552 Number of Prevention Activities 2,474 Number of Staff In -Service Trainings 203 Number of Team Meetings 1,280 Number of Unduplicated Students 9,116 Garrett County Public Schools (GCPS) addressed the impact of the COVID -19 public health crisis on their students' behavioral health and trauma through their Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Summer Programming. This initiative engaged behavior support teachers, including school counselors, social workers, and psychologists, in providing individual counseling and crisis management, employing Solution-Focused Brief Counseling to maintain students' academic involvement. These professionals applied The Five Guiding Principles of Trauma - Informed Care \u2014 safety, choice, collaboration, trustworthiness, and empowerment \u2014 in their interventions. Group and classroom SEL lessons, supported by evidence- based materials like Second Step and Teaching Social Skills to Youth, further enriched the initiative. Pre and post assessments were employed to measure the impact of group an d class lessons, further validating the effectiveness of this trauma and behavioral health intervention. Students participating in GCPS' SEL Summer Programming have demonstrated growth. According to the data collected through performance tasks and pre/pos t assessments, students' proficiency or above -grade -level performance rose from 85% to 93% during the program. This measurable increase demonstrates the effectiveness of the individualized interventions and lessons in enhancing students' knowledge and understanding, thus indicating the program's successful role in addressing behavioral health issues and trauma amid the COVID -19 pandemic. Harford County Public Schools dedicated their funding towards an extensive initiative aimed at increasing trauma awareness and intervention capability among school staff. Counselors received stipends for the creation of trauma -informed resources for school employees, expanding their understanding of the subject matter. Additional allocations were utilized for training stipends for Crisis Prevention Intervention (CPI) and Youth Mental First Aid, two prominent programs focused on recognizing and responding to mental health issues. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 178 State of Maryland Premium Pay Expenditure Group 4 is for SLFRF projects related to Premium Pay. This includes how funds are being used to support sectors or occupations in any premium pay program. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 179 State of Maryland 4A - State Employee Premium Pay Project ID 4A Project Name State Employee Premium Pay Subprojects 2 Budget $114,389,754 Expenditures $114,389,754 Status Completed Expenditure Category 4.1 - Public Sector Employees Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 4A.1 Response Pay for State Employees $61,829,296 $61,829,296 Completed 4A.2 Response/Quarantine Pay $52,56 0,458 $52,560,458 Completed Project Description The state authorized COVID -19 Response and Quarantine Pay to certain groups of employees because they were performing essential services during the public health emergency with limited ability to physically distance per CDC guidelines. Eligible employees included employees working in 24/7 operations within the Maryland Department of Health, Department of Juvenile Services (DJS), and Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS). Plus, all sworn police officers and state firefighters, and certain employees within the Department of Human Services (DHS) and DPSCS that were required to intermittently perform field work. Employees that fell outside of these categories but were still required to report to work under certain conditions were approv ed on a case-by- case basis. Consistent with SLFRF, providing premium pay to eligible workers responds to such workers by helping address the disparity between the critical services and risks taken by essential workers and the relatively low compensation they tend to receive in exchange. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 180 State of Maryland 4A.1 -Response Pay for State Employees ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 4A.1 Response Pay for State Employees $61,829,296 $61,829,296 Completed Eligible employees received $3.13 per hour additional pay for each hour an employee was required to report to work and was unable to maintain adequate physical distance per CDC guidelines.

Maryland provided retroactive payments to eligible employees for work hours for the period of September 9, 2020 to April 6, 2021 that would have been eligible had the pay been available at the time. The retroactive payments for the period September 9, 2020 to April 6, 2021 were based on a methodology, discussed and agreed to by the state's largest employee bargaining unit representative, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 181 State of Maryland 4A.2 -Quarantine Pay ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 4A.2 Quarantine Pay $52,56 0,458 $52,560,458 Completed Eligible employees received $5.13 per hour additional pay for each hour an employee was required to work in designated COVID- 19 quarantine areas. Quarantine pay was available to employees for the entirety of state fiscal year 2021, July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. Employees received the response or quarantine payments directly in their paychecks. Retroactive payments for response pay were issued and included in employee paychecks primarily on May 26, 2021 for state regular employees. Eligible contractual employees primarily received retroactive payments on June 2, 2021. Performance Measures Number of employees compensated: 13,615 Job classification codes compensated: 491 Average compensation per job classification: $69,266 was the state's average salary in 2021 (source: Maryland State Archives). The response pay threshold of 150% above the state's average salary is therefore calculated at $173,125. Less than one-half of one percent (53 of 13,175) of state regular workers in the State Personnel Management System (SPMS) on response pay earned above $173,125. All 53 earned above this level prior to response pay. Response pay did not push any state regular employees over the 150% threshold. Contractual employees were excluded from analysis due to employees primarily receiving hourly pay rates and varying contract periods of performance. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 182 State of Maryland Water, Sewer, and Broadband Infrastructure Projects Expenditure Category 5 is for Water, Sewer, and Broadband Infrastructure Projects.

However, thousands of Marylanders still lack sufficient access to broadband service, mostly because they live in rural communities which are the most difficult and expensive to serve. The Last Mile Infrastructure projects provide financial assistance to construct broadband infrastructure necessary to provide service in areas where broadband service does not currently exist for residents, businesses, and anchor institutions. In 2017, the Office of Rural Broadband was established . The following year a director was appointed to the office and a $100 million cost for service to underserved rural households was identified. $50 million was requested over a five-year period to assist with broadband expansion. $11.8 million in capital and operations funding in fiscal year 2020, and $11.2 million in fiscal year 2021, which was increased to $32.7 million. In April 2021, the Office of Statewide Broadband (OSB) was established by Senate Bill (SB66), the Digital Connectivity Act of 2021. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 184 State of Maryland In 2022, Connect Maryland was launched. It is a transformative initiative to supercharge the state's broadband investment with a total new investment of $400 million to fully address the digital divide. The following chart compares the percentage of households with a broadband internet subscription on the 2015-2019 5-year American Community Survey to the 2016-2020 survey. In addition to SLFRF, the state has been awarded $162,600,000 in Coronavirus Capital Projects Funds . The funds are accounted for in the FY 2023 - 2027 Capital Improvement Program as part of the Local Government Infrastructure Fund. Capital funds will be used to construct infrastructure required to expand high -speed internet where other sources of funding are limited. Connect Maryland capital project funds will work in concert with SLFRF. For these SLFRF projects, local jurisdictions will act as applicants and will have a strong internet service provider (ISP) with whom the jurisdiction will partner in implementing the project. The ISP will have the means and desire to provide service to the applicant's unserved households and businesses. The jurisdiction and/or ISP will be responsible for the overall implementation of the projects and will be the owner of any facilities constructed as part of the project. All fu nded projects will provide a minimum internet connectivity of 100 Mbps down and 100 Mbps up with a maximum latency of 50 milliseconds. The network must be capable of providing the minimum connectivity to all subscribers within the proposed Project area. Th e reason for the grant speed ensures reliability of connection to households who have been suffering from unreliable speeds. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 185 State of Maryland Project Activities Activities may consist of the following: The construction of facilities used to deploy service at the Broad band Grant Speed to all end users located within the project funded service area Middle mile infrastructure directly necessary to provide service to an end user Purchase and installation of equipment and electronics necessary to deliver service to an end user Tower construction and/or tower structural improvements is an eligible cost Equity Related Activities Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis for entities to serve all unserved premises in eligible areas at the Broadband Grant Speed. Equitable scoring criteria have been built into the review of each application. Those projects that have equity plans and address affordability are awarded points to rate them higher than those who do not offer equity plans. The office requires all projects to provide demographics of the project funded areas. These demographics we can utilize to identify project areas that provide service to underserved, low -income, and minority communities. Community Engagement Related Activities Any project plan must include the coordinated involvement of multiple stakeholders and partnerships that will benefit all participants. The Office of Statewide Broadband has met with elected leaders (creation of a task force) to facilitate discussions and gauge their feedback on broadband service offerings and future needs. The office has also met multiple times with local community orga nizations and ISPs to better understand their needs and the impacts their programs have on the communities they serve.

The versatility of our awareness and access ensure that all possible measures of distribution are accounted for. DHCD have worked with ISPs on providing advertisements online and on TV, partnered with local community organizations to post flyers in their facilities and multi -dwelling units. There are no administrative requirements that would result in the inability to complete applications. However, we ensure that the pr ojects we are funding will be carried out by good stewards. Some of these requirements are: Recognized federal 501(c), Federal EIN, Registered Duns & SAM.gov number, and Good standing certificates within Maryland. Intended Outcomes Maryland ranks highly compared to other states in broadband availability and adoption. The state's broadband infrastructure, however, remains a work in progress and there is no one solution that best meets the needs of every community. Effective solutions will vary with the geographic, demographic, political, economic, and technological topology of areas and communities. In Maryland, broadband service needs are being met through a mix of private sector, public sector and cooperative owned networks with varying levels of coverage. As such the outcomes of our projects vary but are weighted within the same goal, ensuring every Maryland resident has access to reliable internet service. Equity Related Outcomes Our outcomes and goals vary greatly as the office would like to see the greatest impact for our projects to close the digital divide. The divide is between those geographic areas that have access equal to or greater than the latest FCC broadband standard and those areas that have access to speeds under the standards. It is important to note that the divide also exists between households who have the digital skills, literacy and perceived need to adopt and utilize broadband technologies and those who do not. Rural areas are particularly affected by both aspects of the digital di vide. The office expects to utilize the demographic data provided within the applications to better understand and address the digital equity concerns in unserved areas of Maryland. Use of Evidence The FCC's most recent broadband deployment report finds that 2.6% of Maryland households (approximately 58,000) lack network availability at the 25 megabits per second (Mbps) download threshold that defines \"broadband.\" Further, a 2017 FCC analysis estimated a $2,200 cost per structure for \"fiber to the p remises\" deployment to 90% of unserved places (the final 10% can be extremely expensive because the remoteness and topography of those places escalate costs). These estimates were used to determine funding (58,000 households x $2,200 = $127.6 million). 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 187 State of Maryland The office has administered, reviewed and evaluated infrastructure related funding and Broadband infrastructure projects since 2019. This project will be the 4th year of the Office's establishment of Broadband Projects. Based on the impact, testimonials, and data received from these past projects we believe the need for the above referenced projects to be designed relevant to the needs of Maryland's Broadband gaps. Similar projects that preceded these: 2019 Infrastructure Pilot Projects (10) 2020 Network Infra structure Projects (4) 2020 Infrastructure Pilot Projects (20) 2021 Network Infrastructure Projects (11) 2021 Broadband Expansion Projects (42) Projects are awarded on a competitive basis for entities to serve all unserved premises in eligible areas at the Broadband Grant Speed. The program will provide grants of between 70% and 90% of the capital construction costs for major broadband infrastructure projects depending on its composition. Projects applied for are expected to serve significant areas of unser ved households and businesses. Labor Practices Project awardees may not discriminate against and hereby certifies that it prohibits discrimination against and will not discriminate against any person on the basis of race, color, religion, ancestry, creed or national origin, sex, marital status, physical or mental handicap, sexual orientation, or age in any aspect of its operations. Awardees shall comply with applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding discrimination and equal opportunity in employm ent. In addition, all awardees, contractors, and subcontractors working on the infrastructure must abide by both the Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law as well as the Maryland Wage and Hour Law. The Maryland Wage and Hour Law is similar to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) but contains some important differences. Performance The following performance measures will be used to monitor progress toward outcomes: Network Infrastructure Recipients (households) and funding by zip code/census tract Recipient demographic info (e.g., race/ethnicity, income level, etc.) Number of households that have service available Number of households that subscribe to service Legislative Initiative Recipients (households) and funding by zip code/census tract Recipient demographic info (e.g., race/ethnicity, income level, etc.) Number of households subscribing to service 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 188 State of Maryland Project Management Measures On-Schedule: A construction build-out schedule with project milestones, showing the time fram es for accomplishing the project objectives and activities on a quarterly basis. This schedule should list all the major network build -out phases and milestones to demonstrate that the network deployment will be completed, and the grant purposes will be fulfilled within the designated grant period as well as assumptions regarding equipment supply chain. The timeframe for completion is over the course of 3 years. On-Budget: A detailed budget of all expenditures related to eligible grant purposes. The budget should include a descriptive name for each capitalized item or group of items in each category whether grant eligible or not. Any ineligible costs necessary for the project, such as building renovations, or similar, must be listed with the costs in the ot her sources of funding column. As the quarterly reports are provided and compared to the quarterly reimbursement amounts the office will ensure that the budget remains on track not to exceed the award amount. On-Quality: Quality of the project itself will be identified as homes passed and homes served. This information is collected within the system design and includes: The types of services (voice, video and/or data) offered and the number of subscribers taking each type of service; The types of technologies used in the network; The total number of end users served. Within the quarterly reports the awardees will provide actual numbers of subscribers being the homes served in comparison to the proposed take rate. The following chart illustrates the total p roject construction costs by county. $142.78 million in American Rescue Plan funding, plus $7.6 million in state funds, for a total of $149.9 million in total grant funding for these projects. The data can be further broken down by zip code to illustrate where within the counties the projects are taking place, for example, in rural locations within a county. Last mile broadband serves less household s because the population density is small in th e project locations. A mile of infrastructure costs the same whether there are 10 homes or 100 along the path. This impacts the cost per location. By design, the se are last mile projects. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 189 State of Maryland 5B - Broadband Services Statewide Project ID 5B Project Name Broadband Services Statewide Subprojects 2 Budget $4,000,000 Expenditures $2,028,676 Status 50% Complete Expenditure Category 5.21 - Broadband: Other projects Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 5B.1 Broadband - Digital Inclusion Fund $2,000,000 $28,676 Less Than 50% Complete 5B.2 Recovery Now -Broadband $2,000,000 $2,000,000 Completed Project Description This project provides support to address the digital divide. 5B.1 - Broadband -Digital Inclusion Fund The Digital Inclusion Fund provides support to non- profits for the purpose of making communities better able to participate in a digital society. 5B.2 - Recovery Now -Broadband This SLFRF project provided immediate financial assistance to construct broadband infrastructure necessary to quickly provide service at the Broadband Grant Speed in areas where broadband service did not currently exist.

Charlotte Hall Veterans Home has been proudly \"Serving Those Who Served\" since 1985, and offers a continuum of care from its 126-bed assisted living program to its 318-bed skilled nursing program. The home is Medicare/Medicaid certified, and all veterans receive a per diem subsidy from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Its mission is to continually deliver a safe, dignified, and compassionate health care system, and to provide a nurturing and engaging home environment for Maryland's veterans. In 2016, the state established the Charlotte Hall Veterans Home Fund as a special, nonlapsing fund to maintain the operation of the facility. Its intent was to improve fiscal stewardship by reduci ng the state's exposure to financial volatility / risk. Under the contract with the facility's management, all federal funds provided to the state, for example the per diem subsidy from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, are remitted to the contracto r. In exchange, the contractor makes bed lease payments that are paid regardless of whether all beds are filled. The bed lease payments are then used to pay for costs. When the pandemic hit, and nursing facilities were described as high risk COVID hot spots, the count of filled beds at Charlotte Hall shrank by 25%. As a result, federal subsidies were decreased. SLFRF provided valuable relief to balance revenue attrition with the need for quality care / services, medical staffing, and maintenance. The prioritized use of SLFRF support ed staffing based on projections to bring the resident count back to pre-pandemic levels. The tight labor market and perceptions of COVID in nursing facilities has slowed this progress. A strategic review is underway in FY24 to br ing Charlotte Hall back to pre -pandemic levels. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 196 State of Maryland Maryland Department of Transportation SLFRF Projects ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 6A.2 Transportation Trust Fund - Maryland Department of Transportation - Maryland Transit Administration $500,000,000 $500,000,000 Completed 6A.3 Maryland Transit Administration - Farebox Revenue Replacement $1,540,095 $1,540,095 Completed 6A.4 Additional Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) Relief $40,000,000 $40,000,000 Completed 6A.5 Recovery Now Maintenance $10,000,000 $10,000,000 Completed 6A.6 Recovery Now -Maryland Department of Operations 6A.02 - Help out the Transportation Trust Fund (TTF) - Maryland Department of Transportation - Maryland Transit Administration 6A.03 - Maryland Department of Transportation -Maryland Transit Admi nistration - Farebox Revenue Replacement 6A.06 - Recovery Now - Maryland Department of Transportation -Transit Operations 6A.15 - M aryland Department of Transportation - Maryland Transit Administration - Additional Revenue Replacement per Budget Amendment 053 -23 The Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT) Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) is responsible for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the Baltimore metropolitan area transit system and commuter services in suburban areas of the state. Transit modes include bus (local and commuter), mobility paratransit, the Baltimore Metro, light rail, and commuter rail, known as Maryland Area Regional Commuter (MARC) rail. Pandemic related closures significantly impacted MDOT MTA's operations and budget. The commuter bus and MARC train services experienced the steepest reduction in ridership, with declines of more than 9 0% as compared to ridership before the pandemic. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 197 State of Maryland A decline in ridership directly translates to a decline in revenues. MDOT MTA's operating revenues in FY 2022 were 54% lower (- $91 million) than the pre -pandemic forecast published in January 2020. In addition to operating revenues, MDOT MTA's budget relies heavily on support from other transportation taxes and fees, which were also negatively impacted by COVID -19, including motor fuel tax revenue, which was 11% lower (-$140 million) in FY 2022 than had been forecasted pre -COVID. The SLFRF provided relief from lower revenue, particularly in bus operations. Activities for Subprojects 6A.02, 6A.03, 6A.06, and 6A.15 Maryland Department of Transportation - Maryland Transit Administration Despite the significant decrease in transit ridership - and thus transit revenues - during the COVID- 19 pandemic, transit remains a critical service connecting essential workers and others to employment, housing, healthcare, schools, and shopping. Support from the SLFRF allowed MDOT MTA to continue to provide service despite decreased ridership, decreased revenues, and increased costs for janitorial services, personal protective equipment, employee incentives, and other needs related to the pandemic response. Although the need for a direct response to pandemic conditions lessened in FY 2023, MDOT MTA continued to experience dramatic cost increases due to supply shortages and high inflation rates. Major cost increases affected parts and inventory, diesel fuel, employee salaries, and liability insurance, among others. The SLFRF helped offset revenue shortfalls so that cost increases could be addressed and MDOT MTA could achieve important milestones in FY 2023, including bus service enhancements and higher wages for bus and rail operators. Bus Service Was Enhanced: The SLFRF supported a continued enhancement of core bus service. In August 2022, MDOT MTA implemented three route changes to expand service: a new route between the University of Maryland Baltimore County and the Patapsco Light Rail station, new 24- hour access between Morgan State University and Johns Hopkins University, and improved accessibility to the Patapsco Light Rail station. The bus service modifications reflect MDOT MTA's commitment to prioritize equitable access and improve service reliability as ridership continues to rebound from COVID -19 lows. As of March 2023, core bus ridership was at 82% of pre- pandemic levels, a substantial increase from the low of 47% in late FY 2020. Wages Increased for Bus and Rail Operators: Like transit agencies nationwide, MDOT MTA has faced a tight labor market. The SLFRF supported wage increases effective May 2023 that are part of an intensive recruitment campaign to hire bus and rail operators. Also, with the new pay and advancement structure it will take less time for operators to achieve higher pay rates and ultimately advance to the top rate for their job. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 198 State of Maryland The starting wage for all newly hired bus and rail operators increased nearly 10% . Bus operator hourly wages increased from $22.62 to $24.84 and rail operator wages increased from $24.62 to $26.84. Current bus and rail employees will receive increases in accordance with their years of service, in addition to cost-of- living adjustments scheduled for July 1, 2023. The new structure means operators will earn the top rate after only three years with the agency. Recruitment efforts have included a significant increase in outreach through job fairs, advertising, and social media. On May 13, 2023, MDOT MTA held the fir st in a series of on -site bus operator hiring events designed to streamline the hiring process and decrease barriers to employment. Fare Increases for Riders Were Postponed: Until Senate Bill 617 was passed in 2023, MDOT MTA was mandated under 2013 legislation to increase transit fares for core service every two years. Fares for core service were changed in 2019, and the 2013 law mandated that fares were increased a minimum of 10 cents or higher every two years based on the Consumer Price Index for a ll Urban Consumers (CPI- U) calculation. As a result, fares were set to increase from $1.90 to $2.00 - for Local Bus, Light Rail and Metro Subway. Mobility single-trip fares were set to increase from $2.10 to $2.20. The new fares were set to be effective o n June 27, 2021. Recognizing the importance of transit to Marylanders, the SLFRF was used to delay the impact of the transit fare increases by one year. As a result, core service riders continued to pay $1.90 and Mobility riders continued to pay $2.10 through June 26, 2022. Full Service Was Restored for Commuter Bus and MARC: The SLFRF supported the incremental expenses incurred in restoring full service for commuter bus and MARC services during the pandemic, despite a continued lower level of demand. In November 2020, MARC and commuter bus services began operating under reduced schedules, as they did at the height of the pandemic emergency. Full service resumed for MARC and commuter bus services on August 30, 2021. The temporary reductions in MARC an d commuter bus service included reducing service frequency while retaining the overall span of service on each route, as is implemented on holiday and snow event schedules. The reductions allowed MDOT MTA to preserve MARC train slots on the rails owned by CSX and Amtrak and the contracts with commuter bus providers. Core local bus and mobility paratransit continued to operate on their standard schedules. Transit ridership data and public feedback indicated that it was essential to preserve core bus servi ce. Sanitizing Efforts and Employee Incentives Were Maximized: MDOT MTA made significant efforts to ensure that touch points on transit modes were as safe as possible during the pandemic. Touch points were sanitized daily or even more frequently in facilities and on all MDOT MTA vehicles. The sanitizing agents were government approved. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 199 State of Maryland Also, MDOT MTA provided enhanced benefits to employees to reward their commitment to work during difficult conditions. Employees in certain classifications who were required to work onsite during earlier stages of the pandemic received a response pay differential, which is an additional $3.13 per hour. Employees also received bonus payments and incremental leave time. Overall, the SLFRF has supported MDOT MTA service enhancements, postponement of fare increases, wage increases, sanitizing efforts and other actions necessary to maintain and restore critical transit services during pandemic conditions and into recovery. 6A.05 - Recovery Now - Maryland Department of Tra nsportation - State Highway Administration -State Systems Maintenance The MDOT State Highway Administration (SHA) is responsible for building and maintaining Maryland's numbered highways and bridges outside of Baltimore City. MDOT SHA also oversees operation of traffic and roadway monitoring and management, incident management, traveler information, and snow removal. As with MDOT MTA, pandemic related closures impacted MDOT SHA's operations and budget. The number of vehicle miles traveled declined from 60 billion in FY 2019 to 51 billion in FY 2020, which is notable, but travelers returned to the roads quickly. Therefore, the needs for highway services did not decline as steeply as the overall revenues available to fund the services. The SLFRF allowed cr itical highway operations and maintenance activities to continue despite reduced revenue collections. Activities for Subproject 6A.05 -Maryland Department of Transportation - State Highway Administration -State Systems Maintenance During the pandemic, Maryland citizens returned to the roads quickly after the initial closedown phase. Furthermore, many of MDOT SHA's responsibilities in maintaining highways must continue whether traffic trends are increasing or decreasing. As a resul t, MDOT SHA operations had to respond swiftly to pandemic conditions to ensure that roads were continuously monitored and maintained. The SLFRF supported MDOT SHA's work in road patching, roadside mowing, debris removal, inspections, and cleaning of ditches and inlets, among other activities. 6A.04 - Maryland Department of Transportation - The Secretary's Office - Operations Support MDOT - The Secretary's Office (TSO) is responsible for policy direction, department wide support, and administrative coordination for each of its business units. In the context of the pandemic, MDOT TSO ensured that transportation services continued to operate 24/7/365 to provide critical transportation alternatives to first responders, essential workers, and others to access jobs and medical services and to ensure the movement of goods. Throughout the pandemic, Maryland's transportation system has exemplified the tremendous resiliency of Maryland's people and its economy. The SLFRF provided relief to offset revenue declines so that MDOT TSO could continue to serve as the backbone of coordination and communication. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 200 State of Maryland Activities for Subproject 6A.04 - Maryland Department of Transportation - The Secretary's Office - Operations Support Transportation services are a 24/7/365 servi ce, and transportation played a crucial role in Maryland's response to the pandemic. The work of MDOT was integral to ensuring that first responders, essential workers and others could continue their work despite pandemic conditions. The SLFRF support e nabled MDOT TSO to oversee and coordinate MDOT's rapid responses to the pandemic. These responses included: purchasing emergency supplies such as personal protective equipment, sanitizing agents, and plexiglass to keep MDOT's workers and the traveling publ ic safe; hosting vaccination and booster clinics for frontline MDOT employees; supporting statewide efforts to establish testing and treatment sites; deployment of technology devices and software to enable remote work; development of policies and procedure s for employee telework and pandemic related leave; and administration of employee bonus incentives. Equity Related Activities Access to transportation is one of the most critical social determinants of health. For minority and low-income communities, safe and affordable mobility options are essential for overcoming long-standing disparities in the distribution of opportunities and resources. MDOT believes that all transportation decisions and resources should be considered through a lens of equity. In particular, it is crucial that equity is a focus of the transit services - bus, rail, and mobility - that are administered by MDOT MTA. A commitment to transit equity is clear on several fronts, including in MDOT MTA's draft Statewide Transit Plan . Durin g the COVID- 19 pandemic, equitable transit ridership was preserved to the extent possible, given the dramatic decline in revenues. In April 2022, as transit ridership in the Baltimore region continued to recover from the pandemic, MDOT MTA announced a ser vice realignment to expand access, improve reliability, and optimize schedules on its local bus system. Investment in transit capital projects represents a strong commitment to achieving equity. On July 1, 2022, MDOT MTA released its updated Capital Needs Inventory and Prioritization Report detailing the agency's progress in reducing its State of Good Repair backlog from 16.2% of all assets to 14.4% from 2019 to 2022. Expected levels of state and federal funding through 2031 will further reduce that number to 1.3%, meeting 98% of State of Good Repair needs. MDOT's approach toward equity will become even clearer and more evident as the department works to meet the requirements of Chapter 584 of the 2023 legislative session. This law requires equity to be considered when state transportation plans, reports, and goals are developed, beginning in June 2023. Timeline The SLFRF funds allocated to MDOT supported activities in FY 2021, FY 2022, and FY 2023. The funds received by MDOT are for revenue replacement for regular government operations. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 201 State of Maryland Primary Delivery Mechanisms MDOT engages in an open, competitive, and inclusive procurement process and strives to increase opportunities for minority -, women- , and veteran -owned business, as well as small businesses. Transit services at MDOT MTA are delivered by a combination of st ate workforce and contracted services. Similarly, highway operations and maintenance rely on both state and private employees to connect our customers to life's opportunities. Intended Outcomes The intended outcome of MDOT's use of SLFRF is to offset revenue shortfalls caused by the pandemic so that Maryland's critical transportation activities can continue. In FY 2021, FY 2022, and FY 2023, MDOT's goals were to: minimize disruptions to transportation services for Marylanders caused by the pandemic; ensure that any change in services resulting from depressed demand would preserve an essential level of service; and continue efforts already in progress to improve service performance. Equity Related Outcomes Through continued efforts to develop its S tatewide Transit Plan, MDOT MTA identified strategies to progress toward its vision to deliver a transit system that will connect people, places, and opportunities with efficient, equitable, sustainable, and innovative transit. These strategies include ensuring that transit resources meet the needs to underserved and overburdened communities; continuing to welcome all people onto transit, without tolerance for harassment or discriminatory behavior; providing fully accessible training for people of all cogn itive and physical abilities; reducing cost as a barrier by offering flexible and discounted options for paying fares; and enhancing opportunities for riders to share their transit experience and show how feedback is put into action.

Results show gradual increases in ridership across all modes in 2022 and 2023, but not a full recovery due to new travel patterns for workers. The total transit ridership measure is based on monthly reports from each mode (except light rail, traditional mobility and taxi access) of unlinked passenger trips. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 203 State of Maryland On-time Performance MDOT MTA Percent of Transit 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Actual 2023 Est. 2024 Est. Core Bus Baltimore Metro Light Rail MARC Mobility paratransit and Taxi Access Source: MDOT Managing for Results submission for FY 2024. The on- time performance measure shows the percent of MDOT MTA services that meet scheduled service times. On -time performanc e was affected by the pandemic due to staffing and scheduling challenges, but performance has rebounded. Core bus service is a highpoint in recent efforts to improve on -time performance. MDOT MTA's BaltimoreLink, launched in 2017, represents a complete overhaul and rebranding of the core bus system. Previously, the bus network had many routes that were antiquated, served outdated job locations, and were too long to manage reliably, especially those that traversed downtown Baltimore. BaltimoreLink established an efficient and reliable bus network by spreading out the routes in the downtown core and creating a grid of high- frequency routes. Infrastructure improvements have been made, including dedicated bus lanes and transit signal priority installation. As a result, core bus on -time performance has continued to rise, even in pandemic conditions. On-time performance is a measure of quality. Performance standards are different for each mode. The calculation method is percent of trips arriving on time divided over percent of trips scheduled, including scheduled trips that were run and scheduled trips that were not run. On-time performance is calculated using an exception -based method by subtracting the amount of service not performed on time from the amount of total scheduled service. Core bus, Baltimore metro, light rail, and mobility paratransit use data from internal software systems. MARC rail data is made available by the contracted service providers. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 204 State of 2019 Actual 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Actual 2023 Est. 2024 Est. Ratio of farebox revenues to operating expenses MDOT MTA Farebox Recovery Ratio Core Bus & Contracted Commuter Bus Metro Light Rail Baltimore area services (without Mobility paratransit) Washington Contracted Commuter Bus MARC Source: MDOT Managing for Results submission for FY 2024. The farebox recovery measure is the ratio of farebox revenues to operating expenses. The numerator of the equation is farebox revenues plus some non-farebox revenues, such as advertising on transit vehicles and in stations. The denominator is operating expenses. Capital expenditures are not included in the calculation. Although few transit systems worldwide generate sufficient revenues to cover operating expenses, farebox recovery is still a useful tool in the context of understanding the amount of operating revenues and public subsidy required to operate the transit system. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated an existing decline in ridership, revenues, and farebox recovery, which required greater public subsidy to continue to operate the system. This need for greater public subsidy came at a time when many state revenues were also being negatively impacted by the COVID- 19 pandemic. Recovery of transit ridership and revenues is expected to occur at a much slower pace than the recovery of other transportation services, several of which have already fully rebounded from the negative impacts of the pandemic. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 205 State of Maryland State Highway Administration Despite a temporary decline in vehicle miles traveled, travelers returned to the roads quickly and MDOT SHA maintained service levels and investments in its system.

Actual Actual Actual Source: MDOT Managing for Results submission for FY 2024. The measure of annual vehicle miles traveled decreased by approximately 16% in FY 2020 as a result of the COVID -19 pandemic national shut down orders. The lifting of these orders in 2021 resulted in a steady increase in vehicle miles traveled. Growth is expected to continue into FY 2024 and the following years. Vehicle miles traveled is an input measure. It represents the annual average daily traffic, or average number of vehicles traversing a section of road in a day, multiplied by the length of roadway. The traffic data does not include parking lots or private streets. The measure of annual vehicle miles of travel represents the vehicles miles of travel for a particular section of road, multiplied by 365. Annual calculations are completed each June and submitted to the Federal Highway Administration. Estimates for future years are based on a rolling average of the prior 10 years, adjusted to reflect monthly estimates, general economic trends, and other factors such as weather. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 206 State of Maryland 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Est. 2023 Est. 2024 Est. $ in Millions MDOT SHA Maintenance Activity Expenditures Source: MDOT Managing for Results submission for FY 2024. Maintenance activity expenditures were affected by the COVID -19 pandemic. Shut down orders and the changes needed to keep workers safe resulted in lower than planned maintenance activity. Yet maintenance activity did not decline significantly because this spending ensures that safety and other standards are consistently met. Maintenance expenditures rebounded quickly to align with prior year levels and they are expected to increase in FY 2024. This is an output measure, representing expenditure data from MDOT SHA's seven maintenance districts, Office of Maintenance, Office of Traffic and Safety, Statewide Operations Center, and Office of Environmental Design. Expenditures include payroll, equipment, and usage costs. Acceptable Pavement Condition 2019 2020 Actual 2021 Actual 2022 Est. 2023 Est. 2024 Est.

Overall acceptable pavement condition is an outcome measure. It is an estimated value based on an analysis of State of Good Repair, incorporating re maining service life measured on a scale of 0 to 50 years. Roadway mileage is defined as the number of mainline lane-miles of highways owned by MDOT SHA, including both directions of divided and undivided highways. A lane mile is one lane width multiplie d by one mile in length. Data collection for ride quality, functional cracking, structural cracking, and rutting is conducted using Automated Road Analyzer (ARAN) vehicles. Friction data is collected using skid trucks. ARAN collection is conducted on highways at least one mile long on an annual basis, while routes of less than 1 mile and ramps are measured on a 3 -year cycle. Typically, friction collection is conducted on highways at least one mile long, in one direction, alternating each year. Friction data for routes of less than 1 mile and ramps are measured on a 2 -year cycle. As of June 2020, MDOT SHA adopted a new friction management approach that considers the friction demand of each roadway segment. This approach identifies sections where skid resistance is most needed and is an example of MDOT SHA's commitment to continue performance improvements even while operating under difficult pandemic conditions. Maryland Department of Transportation - The Secretary's Office Transportation is an essential 24/7/365 operation that must continue to operate and be available to first responders, essential workers, and others despite pandemics or other emergencies.

The Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) conducts administrative hearings on behalf of the state and other government agencies. By law, persons adversely affected by agency actions are entitled to an administrative hearing. The hearings are conducted by Administrative Law Judges who adjudicate questions of fact and law. Each year, the Maryland Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) charges state agencies a predetermined fee based on the number of hearings that were conducted in relation to the agency during the prior fiscal year. The Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) typically pays its OAH fee using revenue from the Housing Counseling and Foreclosure Mediation Fund (\u00a7 4- 507). This revenue is collected from foreclosure -related filing fees. The state's foreclosure moratorium throughout the COVID -19 pandemic resul ted in a revenue shortfall. The $1,100,000 budget for this subproject was used to offset the shortfall in FY 2021 to cover the fee to OAH.

Equity Related Awareness, Access, and Dist ribution The state's website, Maryland.gov received the Center for Digital Government GOVX 2021 Overall Winner Award (3 rd Place) for Government Customer Experience. Maryland.gov also won best in class from the Interactive Media Awards in 2022. Maryland's ongoing push toward a unified and mobile -friendly citizen experience across all channels is mission critical to equity related awareness, access, distribution. COVIDLINK provides a central source for public access to vaccine, testing and treatment, and contact tracing resources. DoIT and MDH have partnered to develop \"COVID Link\", a state- of- the-art data management platform, to facilitate the state's contact -tracing effo rt. The platform is fully operational in all 24 jurisdictions. The innovative COVID Link platform uses medical data 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 212 State of Maryland from the Chesapeake Regional Information System for our Patients (CRISP) so that officials gain crucial information to determine steps to lo wer the risk of the virus spreading. Maryland OneStop Portal is an innovative approach to citizen engagement as it provides a single location for locating and submitting forms, and license and certification applications across the state government. Visitors benefit from intelligent search features and an intuitive, user -friendly design. The OneStop Portal is also reducing the cost and burden for state agencies. Through the use of the OneStop Portal's powerful workflow engine, state agencies can now retire proprietary, custom license systems and fold forms and license processing operations into the tools provided by the OneStop Portal. DoIT developed and launched multiple applications on the OneStop Portal during the COVID-19 pandemic including: Maryland Small Business COVID -19 Emergency Relief Loan Fund Maryland Small Business COVID -19 Emergency Relief Grant Fund Manufacturing Innovation Grant Application SLFRF Water and Sewer Assistance Grant Application DoIT implemented approval workflows for the Department of Commerce to process these applications as well as customized notifications to the applicants for when their applications are approved, denied, or missing documentation. Over 40,000 users are engaged with the new system. DoIT was able to integrate these applications into the OneStop Portal in days, saving Commerce valuable time (and cost) versus building a new system. Throughout the COVID -19 Pandemic, the OneStop portal demons trated its true value as a platform, as DoIT and the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) administered numerous pandemic assistance programs for affected communities and local businesses, including: Nonprofit Recovery Initiative (NORI) NORI for Behavioral Health Administration Strong Economic Recovery Initiative (SERI) for Entertainment Venues SERI for Tourism SERI for Mainstreet Project RESTORE Community Safety Works (CSW) In FY23, agencies started using subproject 6A.19 for telework related equipment for state personnel. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 213 State of Maryland 6A.10 -Vaccination Lottery ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 6A.10 Vaccination Lottery $2,000,000 $2,000,000 Completed In an effort to get every eligible Marylander vaccinated, the Maryland Lottery partnered with the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) to thank vaccinated Marylanders while also incentivizing new vaccinations with a $2 Million VaxCash Promotion.

This outreach helped to ensure that the state's jurisdictions with the greatest need would receive an equitable proportion of funds. Intended Outcomes Deter crime and promote community safety Engage nonprofits and local governments in activities that address crime deterrence and community safety Encourage activities that follow best practices for crime prevention and intervention and community safety 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 220 State of Maryland Promoting Equitable Outcomes The Community Safety Works program has a direct impact on the revitalization of business districts and neighborhoods throughout the state by supporting community-led projects and activities that deter crime and improve areas. As the map below depicts, the majority of Program funds have gone to the jurisdiction in Maryland with the greatest need: Baltimore City received nearly $7 million, or 70% of Program funds. Project Website Link to the Community Safety Works website Use of Evidence The Community Safety Works program encouraged applicants to apply for projects supported by evidence. The following resources were provided to applicants as evidence- based strategies that meet program funding criteria: Project Examples: Facility and Community Improvements Grant and Business District and Neighborhood Safety Grant Crime Statistics Example: The Maryland Sta tistical Analysis Center , within the Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention report on Violent Crime & Property Crime by Municipality Community D esign for Safety: Using Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design to Strengthen Community Cohesion, Health and Safety University of Maryland: Collaborative Violence Intervention and Prevention Program The Art and Science o f Urban Gun Violence Reduction ROCA: Disrupting Incarceration, Poverty, and Racism Keeping the peace: Man uses his story to help change his neighborhood for the better Look at me now': Using neuroscience to help at -risk kids \u2014 and change Maryland's juvenile justice system Performance Performance measures will include: Funding Distribution of CSW Program by County, Zip Code, and Awardee Number of qualifying activities funded Final reports for CSW awards have not been collected yet . 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 221 State of Maryland 6A.14 - Jobs That Build ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 6A.14 Jobs That Build $15,000,000 $15,000,000 Completed The Jobs that Build Employer Fund provides an opportunity for employers impacted by Covid- 19 to pursue innovative solutions to their most pressing workforce challenges. By offering financial assistance to employers who want to meaningfully support and incentivize their employees, the Fund intends to encourage better recruitment, smarter training, and enduring employee retention. The Fund prioritizes two sets of initiatives that employers can consider implementing in their workplace: Employee Support Programs and Payroll Incentives. Business applicants seeking grant funding must propose a program that includes elements of one or both of these initiatives. Project Activities The Jobs that Build Employer Fund empowers employers to look at the needs of their employees and create an in -house Employee Support Program that alleviates some of the chronic barriers in their workforce. Employers have the flexibility to design a program by choosing from a list of allowable expenses and requesting grant funds to establish custom benefits that best suit their employees' needs that currently exist or may arise. Examples of allowable expenses and support ideas include: Transportation - Many employees struggle to get to work because they lack reliable transportation. Employers can leverage grant funds to establish a program to help their employees pay for maintenance on their own vehicles, purchase or lease vehicles, earn a driver's lice nse, and/or pay for the costs of public transportation to alleviate transportation hurdles. Housing - With rising rents, many employees are struggling to keep up or turn down quality jobs because they cannot secure housing in close proximity to work. Employers can leverage grant funds to offer rental assistance or security deposit assistance for their employees or relocation assistance. Child and Dependent Care -Caring for children and family members is another major factor that places limits on an employee's time and finances. Employers can leverage grant funds to establish an assistance program that covers the cost of daycare or supportive care services for employees' families. Wages and compensation are the most direct ways an employer can attract and retain qualified staff. In a competitive labor market, many employers now leverage bonuses and other wage incentives to bolster their workforce and stand out from the competition. The Jobs that Build 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 222 State of Maryland Fund allows employers to seek grant funding that can be used to offer certain wage and payroll incentives to qualifying employees. Examples of allowable incentives include: Signing Bonuses - Employers can leverage grant funds to offer cash signing bonuses for new employees or employees who renew their contracts. Retention Bonuses - Employers can leverage grant funds to offer retention bonuses for employees who stay employed for a defined period of time. Retention bonuses may be used in conjunction with a sign-on bonus for new employees or could be offered to incumbent employees for continuing their employment satisfactorily. Wages during Training -Employers can leverage grant funds to compensate employees for time spent in training or professional development activities that may otherwise not be paid, and are related to the job. Examples include: paying an employee their hourly wage to attend an occupational skills training outside of work hours, or paying an employee their hourly wage to take English language classes outside of traditional work hours. The Jobs that Build Employer Fund grants employers the maximum flexibility in determining how to best serve their employees. Timeline Jobs That Build was launched on October 14, 2022. Subrecipients must spend all grant funds by December 1, 2024, as the grant will expire on December 31, 2024. Intended Outcomes The Jobs That Build Employer Fund will help make historic improvements to both Maryland's 20th century transportation & utility infrastructure, as well as its 21st century information technology infrastructure. In the current employment climate, MD Labor recognizes that competitive wages alone may not be enough to attract and retain employees. The Jobs That Build Employer Fund will support businesses who have creative solutions to address bar riers that are significantly hindering workforce participation and retention. The Fund is designed with the flexibility to address a wide array of present -day challenges that are prohibiting entry into, or increasing departure from, the workforce. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 223 State of Maryland Performanc e Since its launch, 63 businesses have benefitted from the Jobs That Build Employer Fund. Grants were awarded to employers in all 13 regions of the state. Baltimore County received the most, with a total of $3,278,566 or 22% of the total grant. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 224 State of Maryland 6A.16 - Medicare Advantage ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 6A.16 Medicare Advantage $50,000,000 $40,409,196 More Than 50% Complete The federal methodology used to determine payments for Medicare Advantage (MA) plans does not account for Maryland's all -payer rate -setting system under the Total Cost of Care model. In 2022, MA plans operating in Maryland approached the Maryland Department of Health (the Department) to discuss options for stabilization and to propose a program of long- term stabilization. Under the Subsidy Agreement for Medicare Advantage Plans Operating in Maryland, the Department aims to stabilize MA plans in Maryland with a one-year subsidy. During the term of the subsidy program, which will span fiscal year (FY) 2023 (July 2022 through June 2023), the Department will work with MA plans and other key stakeholders to develop a permanent solution that meets the agreement of CMMI and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The General Assembly has d eclared that \"it is a goal of this State to promote the development of a health care system that provides adequate and appropriate health care services to indigent and medically indigent individuals.\" Health -Gen. \u00a7 15-102.1(a). The Maryland Department of Health (the \"Department\") is responsible for the implementation of this goal. The Secretary of the Department administers the Department's budget, is responsible for the health interest of the people of Maryland, and is charged with supervising, generally, the administration of the health laws of the State and its subdivisions, including the adoption and revision of a State health improvement plan. Health -Gen. \u00a7\u00a7 2-104; 2- 105(b) & (c). The Secretary may approve a contract or other written arrangement with a health benefit plan or insurance carrier or another entity that finances the provision of, or delivers, health care services to an identified underserved area of the State. Health -Gen. \u00a7 2-108(c). Project Activities The subsidy program will opera te for one year only. It is intended to be of a limited duration as a bridge to a permanent solution, as negotiated with CMMI and CMS. The resulting solution will align with other state programs and initiatives, e.g., the Total Cost of Care model and the Maryland Primary Care Program (MDPCP). To be eligible for the subsidy program, Medicare Advantage plans must: 1) operate a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) or Dual Eligible Special Needs Plan (D -SNP) product in the state of Maryland; and 2) absent the subsidy and prior to the payment of subsidy funding, 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 225 State of Maryland demonstrate current and projected financial solvency to the satisfaction of the Department and the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA). Subsidy funding, which totals $50 million across the program, will be targeted based on the proportion of an MA plan's MAPD and D- SNP members residing in Baltimore City and Baltimore County as of July 2022. Plans headquartered in Maryland were eligible for a larger proportion of the funding. To qualify for subsidy payments, participating plans must comply with the following terms and conditions: 1. Maintenance (or expansion) of CY 2022 service area through CY 2023; 2. Use of the subsidy for financial stabilization and not expansion of benefits nor inclusion in revenue projections; 3. Participation in discussions to develop an aligned payer proposal for the Maryland Primary Care Program effective CY 2024; 4. Participation in MA workgroup meetings; 5. Provision of data as requested by the Department and the Maryland Insurance Administration, to support the payback of subsidy funding should the Recipient's medical loss ratio decrease to less than 85 percent. Equity Related Activities The General Assembly has declared that \"it is a goal of this State to prom ote the development of a health care system that provides adequate and appropriate health care services to indigent and medically indigent individuals.\" Health -Gen. \u00a7 15-102.1(a). The Maryland Department of Health is responsible for the implementation of this goal. Timeline The subsidy period is FY23. Because reports are due two months following the end of each quarter, payments will extend into FY24. The final reporting deadline is August 31, 2023. Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners There ar e eight Medicaid Advantage plans operating in Maryland. Five participate in the subsidy program: Alterwood, CareFirst, Hopkins, Humana and Kaiser. Three of those plans qualify for the additional 'headquartered' payments: Alterwood, CareFirst and Hopkins. Intended Outcomes Stabilize Medicare Advantage plans operating in the State of Maryland. Performance As of June 30, 2023, all five participating plans were in compliance with the terms and conditions of the subsidy agreement. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 226 State of Maryland Administrative Expenditure Group 7 is for Administrative Projects.

A defendant placed in private home detention must pay the agency's monitoring fee directly to the PHDMA. Legislation passed during the 2021 Maryland legislative session (House Bill 316) prohibits a pretrial defendant from being required to pay a PHDMA for any costs or fees incurred if the defendant: (1)qualifies as indigent under \u00a7 16- 210 of the Maryland Criminal Procedure Article; or (2)is provided a private home detention monitoring device or global positioning system device by the State or a local jurisdiction. Instead, the State must pay a PHDMA for any costs or fees incurred by defendants who meet this criterion. Timeline The bill t ook effect July 1, 2021. It is due to expire June 30, 2024 or when the full $5,000,000 appropriation has been expended. Activities, Primary Delivery Mechanisms, and Partners At the direction of the General Assembly, the Judiciary contracted with the four agencies, certified by the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, to monitor indigent individuals on home detention. The objectives included avoiding confineme nt, jail or detention in congregate settings which could increase the spread of COVID-19. The Maryland Judiciary will provide payments to four (4 ) contractors who are providing monitoring services for defendants who have been determined to be indigent and have a court order granted for private home detention and are eligible to have the device and monitoring fees paid for by the s tate: A1 Trusted Monitoring, Advantage Sentencing Alternative PGM, Inc. (ASAP), Alert, Inc , and Free But Not Free ( FBNF ), LLC . These contractors provide invoices to the Maryland Judiciary for the payment of fees associated with hooking up and daily monitoring of all eligible defendants. The Maryland Judiciary collaborates with Judiciary Circuit Court and District Court Coordinators working in court offices within the counties in which the defendants have charges, to have these submitted invoices verified for accuracy and approved for payment. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 231 State of Maryland Upon completion of the validation process by the coordinators, the Maryland Judiciary processes payments for all approved fees and monitoring charges. This funding will be expended via payments, to the below contractors, for daily monitoring services rendered and other associated fees, as follows: Recipient Award Amount A1 Trusted Monitori ng $500,000 Advantage Sentencing Alternative PGM, Inc. (ASAP) $4,000,000 Alert, Inc. $250,000 FBNF, LLC (Free But Not Free) $250,000 Total $5,000,000 Award amounts are subject to change. Intended Outcomes The project aims to achieve the following outcomes: 1. Equitable access to pretrial home detention monitoring. 2. Improve access / affordability of home detention, especially amid public health concerns of the spread of COVID -19 in areas of confinement. 3. De-crowding of correctional facilities and associated cost savings. Use of Evidence According to the Centers for Disease Control, correctional and detention facilities face unique COVID-19 challenges, such as high risk of viral introduction and high risk of rapid transmission. 26 Pre-trial defendants that do not have the economic resources for home monitoring fees are confined to a detention facility with an increased risk of COVID- 19. The American Bar Association notes that pre-trial detention has a disproportionate impact on communities of color and exacerbates economic hardships. 27 It is assumed that some defendants who would potentially be approved by a judge for private home detention services are not currently requesting it due to an inability to pay and that more indigent defendants will request home monitoring (and be approved) once it is available at no cost. Performance Report Outcome Measure : Number of Days Monitoring Services Provided Output : With an average daily monitoring rate of $15/day, the average number of days that monitoring services have been provided are 137,431 days. 232 State of Maryland 7A.4 -Private Sector Telework ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 7A.4 Private Sector Telework $5,000,000 $5,000,000 Completed This SLFRF project provided funding to local governments for grants of up to $5,000 to businesses to improve employee telework opportunities. The Maryland Economic Development Assistance Authority and Fund (MEDAAF), within the Department of Commerce, provided grants to local jurisdictions (all 23 counties and Baltimore City). During the pandemic, telework opportunities helped certain businesses to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission, increased retention, and offered businesses a wider applicant pool for re cruiting. Telework support funding was awarded to local jurisdictions in July and August 2021. Local jurisdictions then solicited grant applications and awarded grants to businesses to either facilitate new telework expansion or reimburse businesses for previous telework expenses. Outcomes Increased financial viability of businesses by adopting telework policies during the pandemic state of emergency . Reduced COVID- 19 transmission risk Performance 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 233 State of Maryland 7A.5 -Recovery Now -Department of Budget and Management -Disparity Grants ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 7A.5 Recovery Now -Department of Budget and Management - Disparity Grants $5,000,000 $5,000,000 Completed To mitigate the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on local jurisdictions' ability to raise revenue, the Disparity Grant Program provided noncategorical state aid to low -wealth jurisdictions for use by local governments. Disparity grants address the difference in the abilities of counties to raise revenues from the local income tax, which for most counties is one of their larger revenue sources. Counties with per capita income tax revenues less than 75% of the statewide average receive grants unless a county has an income tax rate below 2.6%. Under current law, aid received by counties equals the lesser of the dollar amount necessary to raise the county's per capita income tax revenues to 75% of the statewide average or the amount received under capped provisions. SLFRF were used to provide additional grants to three jurisdictions to mitigate the impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) worked with the Comptroller's Office to process the transfer payments totaling $5 million. DBM initiated the transfer of funds on March 4, 2021 and direct vouchers were issued on March 9th. $3,498,738 to Prince George's County $360,034 to Dorchester County $1,141,228 to Wicomico County 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 234 State of Maryland 7A.6 -Substitute for Public Health Costs ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 7A.6 Substitute for Public Health Costs $12,668,363 $12,688,363 Completed This SLFRF project provides operating grants to all 24 Local Health Departments that can be used for ten core services areas as outlined in Maryland Code, and to address COVID -19 related revenue shortfalls.

As described earlier in this report in section 2B.1, the pandemic has increased prior concerns about mental health . Survey data suggests that economic anxiety, feelings of loneliness, and depressive disorder are on the rise\u2014four in ten American adults now report feelings of anxiety or depression, up from just one in ten prior to the pandemic. In addition, these effects have been disproportionately felt by essential workers, who are more li kely to report feelings of anxiety, depression, and substance use as well as represent communities of color. Use of Evidence A Kaiser Family Foundation report from February 2021 noted that one in five essential workers recently reported that they have \"seriously considered suicide in the last 30 days,\" compared to eight percent of nonessential workers. In addition, 25 percent of essential workers report that they have increased use of or started use of substances to cope with stress, compared with 11 percent of non -essential workers. Nearly 50 percent of individuals of color in recent surveys reported feeling depressed. This may be attributed to the fact that members of these communities have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19, are more likely to be essential workers, and have historically had more difficulty in accessing behavioral health care. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has long recognized the importance of providing access to qualified professionals who can respond in real- time to mental health and substance use disorder (SUD) crises. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 236 State of Maryland 7B - Administrative Expenses Project ID 7B Project Name Administrative Subprojects 1 Budget $15,000,000 Expenditures $3,387,327 Status Less Than 50% Complete Expenditure Category 7.1 - Administrative Expenses Financial Summary ID Subproject Name Budget Expenditures Status 7B.1 Administrative Expenses $15,000,000 $3,387,327 Less Than 50% Complete Project Description This project is for the management of SLFRF.

The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) created the SLFRF Management System. Using Treasury- compliant metadata templates, DBM created the Maryland SLFRF Data Model. When SLFRF project teams report progress on obligations, expenditures, performance, and other compliance reporting requirement s each month, the Maryland SLFRF Data Model standardizes the data and makes it available for ad -hoc and scheduled reporting, data mining, sharing, and in analytics and dashboards for management. Data governance is enforced through the Chief Data Officer's framework. Data storage, analytics, and collaboration software are provided by the Department of Information Technology as a shared service to SLFRF project teams. The Department of Budget and Management implemented a professional development curriculum based on the U.S. Treasury's SLFRF Compliance and Reporting Guidance . Live and on-demand training classes, a knowledge repository, and a collaboration space for SLFRF project teams help to ensure coordination for project and performance management.

In some cases, for example, in water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure projects, additional information was requested including labor practices, per the U.S. Treasury's SLFRF Compliance and Reporting Guidance . Project Description Provide a description of the project. Describe how funds are being used to respond to negative economic impacts of the COVID -19 public health emergency, including to households and small businesses. The U.S. Treasury encourages uses of funds that promote strong, equitable growth, including racial equity. Please describe how your project's planned or current use of funds prioritizes economic and racial equity as a goal, names specific targets intended to produce meaningful equity results at -scale and articulates the strategies to achieve those targets. For example, assistance to households, small businesses, and nonprofits to address impacts of the pandemic, which have been most severe among low- income populations. This includes assistance with food, housing, and other needs; employment programs with barriers to employment who faced negative economic impacts from the pandemic (such as residents of low - income neighborhoods, minorities, disconnected youth, the unemployed, formerly incarcerated people, Veterans, and people with disabilities); and other strategies that provide disadvantaged groups with access to education, jobs, and opportunity. Project Activities Provide an overview of the main activities of the project. Equity Related Activities As appropriate, include efforts to date to promote equity. For example, are there particularly historically underserved, marginalized, or adversely affected groups that you intend to serve with project activities? Community Engagement Related Activities Please describe how your project's planned or current use of funds incorporates written, oral, and other forms of input that capture diverse feedback from constituents, community -based organizations, and the communities themselves. Where relevant, this description must include how funds will build the capacity of community organizations to serve people with significant barriers to services, including people of color, people with low incomes, limited English speaking proficiency populations, and other traditionally underserved groups. Timeline Provide the approximate timeline of the project and/or subprojects. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 240 State of Maryland Primary Delivery Mechanisms and Partners Describe the primary delivery mechanisms and partners. Equity Related Awareness, Access, and Distribution How equal and practical is the ability for residents or businesses to become aware of the services funded by the project? Are there differences in levels of access to services across groups? Are there administrative requirements that result in disparities /ability to complete applications or meet eligibility criteria? Intended Outcomes Describe the outcomes the project intends to achieve. Equity Related Outcomes Are intended outcomes focused on closing gaps, reaching universal levels of service, or disaggregating progress by race, ethnicity, or other equity dimensions where r elevant for the policy objective? Describe any constraints or challenges that impacted project success in terms of increasing equity. This section must describe the geographic and demographic distribution of funding, including whether activities target tra ditionally marginalized communities. Project Website Provide a link to the website of the project if available. Use of Evidence Briefly describe the goals of the project, and whether SLFRF funds are being used for evidence- based interventions, the evidence -base for the interventions, and/or if projects are being evaluated through rigorous program evaluations that are designed to build evidence. Identify the dollar amount of project spending allocated towards evidence-based interventions. Recipients are encouraged to use relevant evidence clearinghouses, among other sources, to assess the level of evidence for their interventions and identify evidence -based models that could be applied in their project. Recipients are exempt from reporting evidence- based interventions in cases where a program evaluation is being conducted. If a recipient is conducting a program evaluation in lieu of reporting the amount of spending on evidence-based interventions, they must describe the evaluation design. Performance Report Report on key performance indicators (performance measures). Include both output and outcome measures. If your project is completed or underway, then report each performance measure, its results, targets (if applicable), trend analysis (if applicable), and narrative providing context to help the reader interpret the results. If your project has not started yet, then simply list the performance measures you plan to use. Provide data disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, income, and other relevant factors, if possible. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 241 State of Maryland Appendix B -Defining Disadvantaged Geographies Reference data is often used in data analytics to provide a basis for calculations and analysis. Reference data is also used to simply provide context. For example, many SLFRF projects have eligibility criteria expressed as a percentage of poverty level 28: The State of Maryland uses various formulas to calculate disadvantaged geographies, underserved populations, and overburdened areas. Depending on the use case, agencies may calculate these populations based on the laws, regulations, and policies most relevant to the government program it serves. The following are three examples: Using the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 10.62.01.01(B)(13) definition of Economically Disadvantaged Areas and U.S. Census Bureau demographic data to identify geographies. For example, the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission guidance identifies 61 of Maryland's 468 zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) as Economically Disadvantaged Areas using this approach. The Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 defines underserved and overburdened populations. U.S. Census Bureau data and other data sources are then used to identify census tracts that meet the criteria as underserved and/or overburdened. Investments in broadband may be identified using the Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 definitions. 28 2023 Poverty Guidelines; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 242 State of Maryland The Department of Commerce and the Department of Housing and Community Development use multiple sources to define Disadvantaged Geographic Areas, including the U.S. Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) map, Qualified Census Tracts, HUB Zones, and Opportunity Zones. Investments in broadband may be identified this way too. Or u sing a combination of sources. One of the challenges to using data analytics with all of the various definitions is to understand the context for when an agency applies the right definition to the right government program. The Department of Budget and M anagement did not require agencies to use one standard definition for equity analysis across the entire portfolio of SLFRF projects. Instead, DBM provided the flexibility for agencies to use their best definition for each project. This also created an opp ortunity to strengthen the cross-agency collaboration between analysts, grants managers, and program managers tasked with improving equity- related data analytics. DBM's learning agenda includes lowering the data literacy barrier so that more state employee s have the skills and easy -to-use tools to perform equity analysis. The following are more details about the three examples: Defining Economically Disadvantaged Areas Example #1 The Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 10.62.01.01(B)(13) defines Economica lly Disadvantaged Areas as having: A median income that is 80 percent or less of the average median household income in the state; An unemployment rate that is at least 150 percent of the unemployment rate in the state; A health uninsured rate that is at least 150 percent of the health uninsured rate in the state; A food stamp or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Plan (SNAP) rate that is at least 150 percent of the food stamp or SNAP Rate in the state; and A poverty rate that is at least 150 percent of the poverty rate in the state. The Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (MMCC) evaluated each metric using the 2012 - 2016 5- year American Community Survey (ACS) to identify sixty -one (61) zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) th at qualify as Economically Disadvantaged Areas in Maryland and published them in its Guidance for Identifying Economically Disadvantaged Areas on January 11, 2019. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 243 State of Maryland Defining Underserved and Overburdened Example #2 The Maryland Climate Solutions Now Act of 2022 defined Underserved Community and Overburdened Community. The Maryland Department of the Environment created the Environmental Justice Screening Tool in June 2022 to align with the legislation. The state's Justice40 -related compliance is found within the legislation. The Environmental Justice Screening Tool uses the 5 -year American Community Survey (ACS) data published by the U.S. Census Bureau. Climate Solutions Now Act definitions: Underserved Community An underserved community means any census tract in which, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau Survey (5-year American Community Survey): At least 25% of the re sidents qualify as low income; At least 50% of residents identify as nonwhite; OR At least 15% of the residents have limited English proficiency Overburdened Means any census tract for which three (3) or more of the following environmental health indicators are above the 75 th percentile statewide: Particulate matter (PM) 2.5, Ozone, National Air Toxics Assessment (NATA) Diesel PM, NATA Cancer Risk, NATA Respiratory Hazard Index, Traffic Proximity, Lead Paint Indicator, National Priorities List Superfund Site Proximity, Risk Management Plan Facility Proximity, Hazardous Waste Proximity, Wastewater Discharge Indicator, Proximity to a Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO), Percent of the Population Lacking Broadband Coverage, Asthma Emergency Room Discharges, Myocardial Infarction Discharges, Low-Birth Weight Infants, Proximity to Emitting Power Plants, Proximity to a Toxic Research Inventory Facility, Proximity to a Brownfields Site, Proximity to Mining Operations, Proximity to a Hazardous Waste Landfill 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 244 State of Maryland Defining Disadvantaged Geographic Areas Example #3 - Includes multiple sources For reducing negative economic impacts, the Maryland Department of Commerce uses data from official federal sources to establish an overall map of Disad vantaged Geographic Areas. The Department of Housing and Community Development also utilizes one or more of these sources, depending on the program. The Department of Commerce use them together to create a final map with: Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LI HTC) Qualified Census Tracts Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI): Severely Distressed Areas Qualified Low Income Community Investment (QLICI): Severely Distressed Areas HUB Zones Qualified Opportunity Zones Final Map of Economically Disad vantaged Areas The final map shows all of Maryland's census tracts (using the 2010 definition) that are disadvantaged. Out of 1,394 land census tracts (an additional 12 tracts represent water areas), 433 are marked as economically -disadvantaged by one or more Federal programs. An additional four are marked as \"adjacent\" opportunity zones, which means that they are not actually in distress but are adjacent to tracts that are. Commerce may choose to exclude adjacent oppor tunity zones as they themselves are not economically disadvantaged. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 245 State of Maryland The tract breakdown by jurisdiction is as follows: Row Labels Adjacent OZ Disadvantaged Not Disadvantaged Total Percent Disadvantaged 001 Allegany 9 14 23 39% 003 Anne Arundel 6 98 104 5% 005 Baltimore 44 170 214 20% 009 Calvert 1 2 15 18 16% 011 Caroline 3 6 9 33% 013 Carroll 1 37 38 2% 015 Cecil 3 16 19 15% 017 Charles 1 6 23 30 23% 019 Dorchester 9 9 100% 021 Frederick 12 49 61 19% 023 Garrett 7 7 100% 025 Harford 8 49 57 14% 027 Howard 1 54 55 2% 029 Kent 1 4 5 20% 031 Montgomery 34 181 215 16% 033 Prince George's 2 93 123 218 47% 035 Queen Anne's 1 10 11 9% 037 St. Mary's 1 16 17 6% 039 Somerset 6 1 7 86% 041 Talbot 2 8 10 20% 043 Washington 10 32 31% 045 Wicomico 10 9 19 53% 047 Worcester 16 16 100% 510 Baltimore City 148 52 200 74% State Total 4 433 957 1394 31% To test this map with real- world data, recipients of the COVID -19 Emergency Grant Program were mapped. Of the 14,286 recipients who were mailed a grant relief check prior to February 12, 2021 under this program, 25.4 percent were located within an economically disadvantaged geographic area according to these definitions. Of the total $141 million that was disbursed prior to February 12, 25.4 percent was sent to companies located in economically disadvantaged geographic areas. However, as the table below shows, there was a great deal of variation between each county. All recipients in two counties (Do rchester and Garrett) were counted as being disadvantaged due to the classification of each county as a rural HUB Zone. Conversely, no grant recipients were counted as being economically disadvantaged in Howard County, as there are almost no economically disadvantaged areas located within its borders. 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 246 State of Maryland Heading Key: ND is for Not Disadvantaged; AOZ stands for Adjacent Opportunity Zone meaning it is next to an area designated as an Opportunity Zone; D is for Disadvantaged; and %D is for the percentage of grants and expenditures to disadvantaged geographies.

LIHTC Qualified Census Tracts Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Qualified Census Tracts, as defined under the section 42(d)(5)(C) of the of the Internal Reve nue Code of 1986, include any census tract (or equivalent geographic area defined by the Bureau of the Census) in which at least 50 percent of households have an income less than 60 percent of the Area Median Gross Income (AMGI), or which has a poverty rat e of at least 25 percent. CDFI Severely Distressed Areas The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund (CDFI Fund) was created for the purpose of promoting economic revitalization and community development through investment in and assistance to Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs). The CDFI Fund was established by the Riegle Community Development and 247 2023 SLFRF Annual Report State of Maryland Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994, as a bipartisan initiative. The CDFI Fund achieves its purpose by promoting access to capital and local economic growth in the following ways: through its Community Development Financial Institutions Program by directly investing in, supporting and training CDFIs that provide loans, investments, financial services and technical assistance to underserved populations and commu nities; through its New Markets Tax Credit Program by providing an allocation of tax credits to Community Development Entities which enable them to attract investment from the private -sector and reinvest these amounts in low- income communities; through its Bank Enterprise Award Program by providing an incentive to banks to invest in their communities and in other CDFIs; through its Native Initiatives, by taking action to provide financial assistance, technical assistance, and training to Native CDFIs and other Native entities proposing to become or create Native CDFIs; through its CDFI Bond Guarantee Program by issuing bonds to support CDFIs that make investments for eligible community or economic development purposes; and through its Capital Magnet Fund, which offers competitively awarded grants to finance affordable housing solutions for low -income people and low -income communities nationwide. Severely Distressed Areas are (1) characterized by at least one of items 1 -5 on the list below for each QLICI, or ( 2) characterized by at least two of items 6 -16 on the list below for each QLICI: 29 1.

A Census tract identified as a Food Desert, which must either: 1) be a census tract determined to be a Food Desert by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), as identified in USDA's Food Desert Locator Tool; or 2) a cen sus tract that qualifies as a Low-Income Community and has been identified as having low access to a supermarket or grocery store through a methodology that has been adopted for use by another governmental agency, to the extent QLICI activities will increa se access to healthy food. HUBZones The Historically Underutilized Business Zones (HUBZone) program helps small businesses in urban and rural communities gain preferential access to federal procurement opportunities. These preferences go to small businesse s that obtain HUBZone certification in part by employing staff who live in a HUBZone. The company must also maintain a \"principal office\" in one of these specially designated areas The HUBZone program fuels small business growth in historically underutiliz ed business zones with a goal of awarding at least three percent of federal contract dollars to HUBZone-certified companies each year. A HUBZone may be one of the following: A qualified Census Tract (QCT) A qualified Non Metropolitan County (QNMC) A qualified Indian Reservation (QIR) 2023 SLFRF Annual Report 249 State of Maryland A Qualified Base Closure Area (QBA) A Redesignated Area Qualified Disaster Area The SBA uses information obtained from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Labor Statist ics (BLS), the Department of Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of Defense. The HUBZone areas are designated by statute and draw upon determinations and information obtained by other agencies. The SBA does not have discretion when it comes to designating HUBZones. Qualified Opportunity Zones A Qualified Opportunity Zone (QOZ) is an economically distressed community where new investments, under certain conditions, may be eligible for preferential tax treatment. Localities qualify as QOZs if they have been nominated for that designation by a state, the District of Columbia, or a U.S. territory and that nomination has been certified by the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury via his delegation of authority to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
