The U.S. News & World Report , in its annual ranking of public affairs programs, placed us 26th of 220 s chools nationally; in our flagship area of public finance and budgeting, the report placed us 5th in the U nited States. In several of our other fields of concentration, we were in the top 20. Not bad for a college that was only created in 1996. Our enroll ments are strong. We saw 10,000 students in our classes in 2004, compared to 7,100 in 1997. We also continue to be proud of our diversity: 52 percent of our students are women, 52 percent are minority (African American, Hispanic or Asian) and 30 percent of our graduate students are from other countries. Faculty scholarship is impressive and getting better. Last year, our faculty and research associates published 213 papers and books, and presented at over 183 professional meetings and conferences. Our faculty gave invited lectures at numerous universities including Syracuse, Northwestern and Tulane Universities . We edit or co -edit 12 journals and serve on the editorial advisory boards of 40 others. Last year, our faculty refereed for 129 different journals. The centers are doing a booming business in policy analysis and important public bodies continue to reach out to us. The Health Policy Center is becoming the advisor of choice on many matters of health policy, ranging from rural health to health care fin ancing to children's policy. The Fiscal Research Center has been designated as the home of the state economist for Georgia. The Environmental Research Program continues its strong advisory work on Georgia water policy. Research Atlanta and the Regional Lea dership Forum are at home in the Andrew Yo ung School and continue to do important outreach to the community. We are continuing to make good on our promise to develop a global focus. Our International Studies Program continues to work all over the worl d, and is regularly sought after for advice on public policy matters. We hosted two important international conferences, and faculty and research associates worked in 40 countries in 2004. We push hard to find resources to match our university budget al location. In fact, last year we worked with a \"stock\" of $44 million in research money ; in 2004, for every dollar we received from the University, we raised one dollar from external funds. When I read these pages of the 2004 annual report, I can scarcel y believe how much our faculty and staff accomplished this year. All indications are that we will have an even better report for you in 2005. ii 1AYSPS Annual Report 2004 - Table of Contents STAFF OF THE ANDREW YOUNG SCHOOL OF POLICY STUDIES ................................ ................................ ......3 ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AN D STUDENT ACTIVITIES ................................ ................................ ....11 THE OFFICE OF ACADEMIC ASSISTANCE ......13 UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMS , 22 S................................ ................................ ......31 PAPERS , BOOKS AND CHAPTERS : PUBLISHED OR FORTHCOMING ................................ ................................ 33 PAPERS UNDER REVIEW , OR \"REVISE AND RESUBMIT \" STATUS ................................ ................................ ..48 JOURNAL REFEREEING , APPOINTMENTS , AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL ACTIVITIES ................................ ......57 PAPERS PRESENTED AND CONFERENCE PARTICIPATION : DOMES TIC................................ ........................... 69 INVITATIONS TO PRESENT OR WRITE PAPERS IN CY2005 ................................ ................................ ............ 82 SCHOLARLY INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND PROFESSIONAL FOREIGN TRAVEL ................................ .....87 GRADUATE STUDENT ACTIVITIES ................................ ................................ ................................ ................ 94 RESEARCH CENTERS AND DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS ................................ ................................ ................................ ................... 103 DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION AND ................................ .......................... 106 DOMESTIC PROGRAMS ................................

Unlike many other colleges within the University that have employees assigned to specific functional areas, our staff of three wears many hats as they cover a broad spectrum of responsibilities. The OAA staff me mbers are Sue Fagan, Wanda Cooley , and Sally Fowler . The OAA is the advisement office for undergraduate students, and also provides advisement support, as needed, to graduate students. To ensure individualized advisement, each student meets with an advis or in the OAA, and then also is assigned a faculty advisor based on that student 's area of interest. The OAA staff provides academic counseling and referrals to other resources at the University. They assist students with program planning and develop an in dividualized program of study for each student. They provide guidance on interpretation of degree regulations, registration assistance including help with course selection and schedule revisions, and many other services to current students. For new transfe r students, the OAA completes an evaluation of transfer credit and assists in selecting a major and minor or specialization. Returning students, undecided majors, or others interested in a program offered by the AYSPS also are assisted by the OAA. The fir st contact for prospective graduate applicants is usually with the OAA. Graduate admissions is a significant staff function as they respond to initial requests for information, manage the online application, assist prospective students during the applicati on process, work with the program admissions committees to ensure timely decisions on applicant pools, and notify applicants of decisions. The OAA assists with recruitment and graduate orientations for newly accepted students. AYSPS is a host institution for many international scholars; the OAA administers programs sponsored by the American Councils for International Education, the International Research and Exchanges Board, the Fulbright Program of the Institute of International Education, and others. OA A staff also work with the Office of International Services and Programs to process financial documents required for issuance of international students ' visas. OAA staff manages the maintenance and updating of the undergraduate and graduate catalogs and coordinate s course scheduling each semester. They are responsible for the interpretation of college and university policies and catalog regulations and administer all petitions and appeals from students. They act as liaisons between AYSPS students and other units of the University such as the Dean of Students, the Counseling and Career Services offices, the Registrar, the Pullen Library, the Office of Student Life and Leadership, and the Student Advising Center, as well as academic departments. The OAA pro vides faculty support on student issues, including academic honesty, academic performance, and classroom discipline processes. They are responsible for monitoring the academic performance of all AYSPS students, and for notifying students of issues that ari se. They advise students through graduation, and audit each student 's degree requirements for graduation. Doctoral candidates receive OAA assistance when appointing their dissertation committee, scheduling the dissertation defense, and publishing their dissertations. OAA staff participates in a number of university -sponsored events on and off campus including advising and career days at other institutions, Incept orientation for new undergraduate students, and Panther Preview visitor days. Along with the Dean 's Office, they coordinate the annual Honors Day to recognize outstanding students and graduates in the AYSPS. Further information on OAA activities are detailed in the following sections: Undergraduate Programs Master 's Programs Doctoral Programs 14 Undergraduate Programs The Andrew Young School continues to attract a diverse group of undergraduates. This year, 46 percent of our students were women, 54 percent were men; and 56 percent were minority (including students who identified themselves as bla ck, Hispanic, Asian, or mixed). The School actively recruits international students, most of whom attend in the graduate programs, but our undergraduate class included students from 20 different countries who chose a major in the AYSPS this year. Undergr aduate Activities Although the majority of the school 's undergraduates maintain part -time or full -time jobs while attending Georgia State, they are also among the most active in campus and community activities. Georgia State 's Student Government (SGA) pre sident, Tourgee Simpson , a human resources policy major, with the help of other officers, was responsible for involving more students in SGA than ever before by revamping the volunteer program to train potential candidates and recruit freshmen. Senator Josue Heredia , who serves on the Budget and Finance Committee, and senator Genise Mixon , on the Public Relations Committee, are both economics majors. AYSPS senator Dominique Huff , who is distribution manager and a regular columnist for The Signal , and this y ear's director of Rampway , Joseph Winter , are majoring in urban policy studies. Twelve AYSPS students participated in athletics programs: Brian Langman (cross -country), Justin Meyer (baseball), Sylvester Morgan (men 's basketball), Andrea Neely and Monica Thomas (women 's basketball), Jamie Cagle (softball), Veronica Botold and Jacque Redman (women 's soccer), Aaron Farrelly, Tyler Hamilton, Jason Rivers and Chad Wainwright (men 's soccer). Seven AYSPS students, David Boyd, Bonnie Britt, Michael Collins, Glen da Crunk, Blake Dettwiler, Kelley Martin , and Whitney Rusert , were named to Who's Who Among American Universities , in recognition of their exceptional scholarship, extracurricular activities, and service to the university community. Kevin Ward , who teaches at McEachern High School, was nominated to Who's Who Among American Teachers . Glenda Crunk was selected by the Office of Student Life to receive The Nell Hamilton Trotter Student Leadership Award, given to one student each semester in recognition of outst anding leadership and contributions to the campus community. Two economics majors were grand prize winners in the 5th Annual Crossing Paths , Crossing Cultures photo exhibit: Kimberly Cooper took her award -winning Study Abroad photo while visiting South Afr ica as part of the AYSPS/Morehouse College Economic Studies in South Africa program. Huiping Du , who completed the B.S. in Economics program and is currently a master 's student, won the grand prize for International Students. The AYSPS Economics Club is one of the more active student organizations on campus. This year, the club designed posters about economics for use at Panther Preview and the Undecided Majors Marketplace sponsored by the Student Advising Center, wrote articles for Rampway , hosted a new s tudent reception and faculty/student mixer, and presented a popular lecture series with topics designed to appeal to a wide audience (including \"What is the effect of guns and drugs on society? \" and \"How can economics help you make good decisions? \"). Offic ers Jeremiah Handschuh , Brian Johnson and Mario Martinez coordinated these events with the help of faculty advisor, Paul Ferraro . There is also an active chapter of Omicron Delta Epsilon , the national honor society for economics majors, on campus. This yea r, 21 students were nominated to this honor society. Alpha Eta Rho , Gamma Sigma Chapter of the national aviation fraternity is also very active on the Georgia State campus. Twenty new policy studies students with career tracks in aviation qualified for Alpha Eta Rho this year (the chapter now has 50 members). The fraternity is known for its unusual fundraising and recruiting events, inclu ding the Airplane Wash and the plane rides they offer during their Days -at-the-Airport for new and potential aviation st udents. Their most recent program featured rides in a \"Pitts Special \" aerobatic airplane. Rides and club meetings were organized by officers Jared Adams and Joe Stephens with faculty advisor Richard Charles . 15 This year Brian Buckwald , a human resources poli cy major, was president of Circle K International , a student organization sponsored by Kiwanis Club that exists to promote leadership and community service. Other AYSPS students participated in the Black Student Alliance , the Golden Key International Honor Society , the Latin American Student Association , the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), the National Society of Collegiate Scholars , the College Republicans of GSU and the Young Democrats of GSU , among other organizations. Several AYSPS student s who are active in ROTC were recently nominated for The National Society of Scabbard and Blade , a military honor society that will soon initiate a Georgia State chapter. The undergraduate class includes career soldiers in the Army, Navy and Marines who ha ve returned to school to complete AYSPS degrees and advance their military careers, as well as students who plan to join the military after graduation. Economics Always a popular graduate major at Georgia State, the Economics program is increasingly attr acting undergraduate majors. Students may choose an Economics major in the Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science degrees offered by the Andrew Young School, or as a B.B.A. in the Robinson College of Business. All three degree programs continue to grow in popularity: the B.A./B.S. programs experienced a 28 percent increase from Fall 2003 to F all 2004, while the B .B.A.-EC increased by 8 percent. In a recent Web survey, students gave many reasons for choosing Economics as their major: \"...I still believe tha t economics can change part of our world! Not just the theories, but our imagination coupled with knowledge of economics can make a difference. \" \"...Economics makes sense to me. So many fields that I love, like politics, music and community development, are grounded in economic relationships. Even my own personal decisions such as going back to school as a single mother made more sense to me when analyzed with an 'economic ' way of thinking. \" \"...Because everything involves economics and the economy of this co untry depends on us ... we must learn the tools and policies of economics so we can be better informed of what is going on in the world today. \" \"...I chose economics because I 'm interested in how micro -level transactions influence global transactions and inve stments. I plan to go to law school to follow corporate and international law, possibly to work for a multinational corporation or bank. \" \"...It's a science that has real -life, day -to-day impact on everyone. \" Several of our students were lucky enough to su pplement their undergraduate classes with study abroad: \"...I participated in a three -week program this summer called European Union: Yesterday, Today & Tomorrow, based in Strasbourg, France, with trips to Luxembourg, Brussels and Germany. We visited severa l institutions including my two favorites, the Deutsche Bundesbank and the European Central Bank. This was a perfect complement to the economics course I took the previous semester, ECON 4810, International Finance. \" A number of students chose economics as a background preferred by law schools; many others said they planned to apply to graduate school in the fields of economics or business. Marketability is another reason for the growing popularity of the major. A U.S. Census Bureau study showed economics majors were among the highest paid employees \u2014economics ranked third among the most lucrative majors. Recent Georgia State graduates have gone to work for the city and state government, IBM, Bank of America, the Atlanta Regional Commission, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. 16 Among students who chose the B.A. -EC degree, the most popular minor this year was Political Science, followed by Sociology. The most popular upper -level electives selected by B.A. -EC students were classes in Urban Policy Studies, Sociology, and Political Science. The most popular minor for B.S. -EC students was Math, followed by Political Science. Many B.S. students chose various business minors including Accounting, Finance, Risk Management and Real Estate. Their most popular ele ctives were Marketing, Business Administration, Management, English and Sociology. Twelve economics majors are currently earning a dual degree at Georgia State: five have secondary B.B.A. degrees in CIS (2), Management, Marketing and Finance; the others a re earning secondary majors in Political Science (3), Math (2), Journalism and Anthropology. Urban Policy Studies and Human Resources Policy With career tracks in aviation and transportation, local government management, planning and economic development , and public policy, the Bachelor of Science in Urban Policy (B.S. -UPS) degree program has students with a wide range of interests. Whatever the career track, the focus is on policy and how it applies to the real world. Most students in the program complet e internships at public, private and nonprofit agencies in metro Atlanta to gain valuable \"hands -on\" experience (see more details in the PAUS Internship section), and many volunteer in their communities. Here are some of their answers to the question, \"Why did you choose a major in Urban Policy Studies? \" \"...I changed my major to Public Policy after doing an internship at the Carter Center. It changed the way I looked at the world. \" \"...I played SimCity and got interested in city planning. \" \"...I chose Urban P olicy Studies because I 'm interested in how cities and counties function. After graduation I want to go into business for myself or partner with a major firm that specializes in urban redevelopment. I 'd like to be the one that comes in and cleans up the ne ighborhood. \" \"...I'm applying to seminary after graduation and plan to be a missionary. I wanted to learn how to handle resources in a nonprofit. \" \"...I want to understand policy so I can work with labor unions as a negotiator. I plan to apply to law school later. \" \"...Living in two different cities has gotten me interested in transportation (rail), revitalization of cities and renovation of buildings. I want to know how these things are accomplished. \" Most students in the B.S. -UPS program already have jobs b ut returned to school to change their career path. Some aviation students were already working for Delta, Airtran, or in other aviation -related positions at the time they enrolled at Georgia State , hoping to advance their careers (and many have): \"...I chos e policy studies as my major because I realized I wanted to [master] the business aspects of the aviation industry before becoming an engineer. \" \"...I enrolled in AYSPS classes offered at Delta Air Lines training because I felt it would be a good way to tra nsition back into a learning environment. When it was time to go to class on campus, I chose aviation because I 've been in that business for quite a while. I 'm the manager for SkyTeam Cargo U.S. Sales Joint Venture, the marketing organization for Delta, Ai r France and Korean Air Lines U.S. export cargo products. I have thoroughly enjoyed all my classes. \" 17 Students interested in becoming pilots often choose Georgia State because it is the only institution in the state that incorporates pilot training into a n academic degree program: \"...I moved to Atlanta with all my aviation ratings completed ; however , I needed a bachelor 's degree and chose the policy studies program because there was an airline management specialty. \" \"...I went with Georgia State and urban p olicy studies specifically because of aviation \u2014I want to be a pilot. Put in your report: aviation students are the best kids around! \" Fourteen students completed their flight training practicum during the year and four students completed aviation -related internships. The most recent graduates of the B.S. -UPS with an aviation track were employed by Atlantic Southeast Airlines, the National Transportation Safety Board, Varuna Aviation Consulting, and Chautauqua Airlines. This year, the Aviation and Transpor tation career track had the most students, followed by Planning and Economic Development, Public Policy and Local Government Management. B.S. -UPS students do not choose a minor, but complete 7 upper -level electives as part of their degree. Many aviation st udents receive elective credit for completing pilot training; for those who do not, business courses were most frequently chosen as electives. The most popular elective for students in the Planning and Public Policy tracks was Sociology; other popular elec tives were Management, Criminal Justice, African American Studies, Political Science and History. Students in the Local Government track picked Management and Criminal Justice as their favorite electives. In Fall 2001, the \"human resources \" career track i n the B.S. -UPS degree program was spun off as a separate undergraduate degree, the Bachelor of Science in Human Resources Policy and Development (B.S. -HRP). This degree option has drawn students with all kinds of previous work experience, including (in the current class) salespeople, K -12 teachers, vocational education trainers, managers, customer service representatives and instructional technologists. Several students in the program work at Georgia State, in the dean of students, admissions and advising o ffices. The one quality most of these students have in common is their desire to \"work with people \": \"...I love dealing with people, more than just sitting in an office - and you won 't find me at a computer all day. I envision myself interacting with other people, training or interviewing or implementing programs. \" \"...Choosing a degree in HRP was a natural progression for me. It will prepare me for creating my own nonprofit organization, an adoption agency for special needs children. \" \"...As a teacher, I 'm preparing students for the work force of the future and that involves human resource issues so I must be prepared for that. I 'd like to use the training and concepts to help better education by applying them in the management of public education. \" Not surpr isingly, HRP majors ' approved electives most often include Sociology, Psychology, Urban Policy Studies, English, Education and Management, reflecting their interdisciplinary interests. One PAUS class created especially for the HRP core curriculum has bec ome popular with students from other majors and even led some of them to change their major to HRP: \"...I took PAUS 3211, The Career Development Process, and it forced me to actually think about my own career profile. Putting it down on paper made me realiz e I'm not going to be in college forever. That 's when I picked human resources. \" As a result of changing priorities and resources, the B.S. -HRP degree option was phased out this year, though many of the classes will continue to be included in our curricul um. Staff and faculty advisors have held information and planning sessions for HRP majors and will work closely with the 109 students now in the program to ensure they can complete their degree requirements in a timely manner. 18 Twenty -two students in the B. S.-HRP and B.S. -UPS degree programs are currently pursuing dual degrees at Georgia State: eight have secondary B.B.A. degrees in Management (4), Finance (3) and Real Estate; the others are earning secondary majors in Sociology (6), Political Science (2), F rench (2), Economics, Psychology, and Music. One student will graduate with both the B.S. -HRP and B.S. -UPS degrees. Some organizations now employing recent graduates of the B.S. -HRP and B.S. -UPS programs include the Atlanta School system, the Atlanta Fire Department, the Atlanta Regional Commission, Athens/Clark County Planning Department, the Chattahoochee Regional Development Commission, the City of Atlanta, the City of Conyers, Cobb County, Gwinnett County, Innolog Corp., IBM, the Marietta Development Corporation, Partners Development Company, Rich 's/Macy 's, the South Georgia Regional Development Center, the Federal Highway Administration, the Georgia Department of Transportation, the Georgia Office of Planning and Budget, the Forsyth County Planning Dep artment, and Wachovia Bank. 19 Master 's Programs \"Since international students began coming into our mix, all of our perspectives have become more global. This coming together of views and concerns causes us all to better appreciate how complicated the issues have become. International students come to us for an education, and for a technical background that will serve them well when they return to their respective countries. But they also go home with a better sense of our country, and a better sense of how our economy works. As our namesake Andrew Young is fond of saying, 'to know someone is to be able to work with them on the world stage .'\" - Dean Roy Bahl, The Briefing (Spring/Summer 2004 issue) America 's Best Graduate Schools . The April 2004 edition of U.S. News and World Report 's \"America 's Best Graduate Schools ,\" in its 2005 ranking of Public Affairs graduate programs , rated Georgia State University among the top 25 universities in the nation. The rankings place AYSPS programs and curriculum in the top 10 percent of more than 200 schools in four key areas: 5th in Public Finance and Budgeting, 12th in City Management and Urban Policy, 16th in Public Management Administration and 21st in Public Policy A nalysis. Newly Admitted Master 's Students The Master of Arts in Economics continues to attract highly qualified students, many of whom are international students sponsored by agencies such as the Edmund S. Muskie and Freedom Support Act Fellowship Program of American Councils for International Educatio n and the International Research and Exchanges Board. The expectation of these students is that they will complete their master 's degrees and return home to assist their developing countries in transitioning to market economies. Many of the Ph.D. students in Economics choose to acquire a master 's degree in the course of their studies. Applicants to the Master 's in Economics program aspire to accomplish important goals by completing their graduate degree. Here are a few excerpts from some of the goals state ments submitted by students during the application process: \"...I plan to expand my knowledge specifically studying Macroeconomic Fluctuation and Forecasting... I would enjoy using my new degree at the Federal Reserve or another government body as an economis t.\" \"...I have always had an interest in working in the public sector, and have seriously considered a career with the Central Intelligence Agency as an Economic Analyst. \" \"My professional goal is to become a Foreign Service Officer for the State Departmen t, [which] will allow me to work with economic aid given to developing countries. I feel strongly that the combination of my efforts toward a Master 's degree and my Peace Corps service will be an important step in preparing me for my career. \" \"I will be p repared not only with ideas on how to help small businesses and governments develop, but most importantly, will have the training needed to implement these ideas into successful programs. \" \"Matched by the social science degree I already have, the degree i n economics would be extremely useful in every Russian public organization concerned with people 's prosperity... \" The Master of Science in Urban Policy Studies provides an ideal vehicle for studying important public policy issues facing our urban areas and provides a distinctive and flexible curriculum that addresses urban policy, planning, local governance, and research methods. 20 In addition to the master 's degrees, the school now offers four graduate certificate programs in Disaster Management, Nonprofit L eadership, Natural Resource Management and Planning and Economic Development . These programs allow students to take several courses focused on a specific specialization without completing the entire master 's degree. This year saw a marked increase in the o verall number of applicants to these certificate programs. As a result of changing priorities and a resulting shift of faculty resources, the Master of Science in Human Resource Development (M.S. -HRD) program admitted its last class of entering students i n Spring 2004. It will take approximately two years to allow current students to complete their degree. PAUS will continue to offer a Human Resources specialization in the M.P.A. degree and that curriculum is currently being revised. The AYSPS graduated 4 0 Masters in Public Administration (M.P.A.) students in Spring 2004, the largest number yet. The program continues to attract top caliber applicants, many of whom are already employed in the public and nonprofit sectors. M.P.A. students ' average age is 32 and most are returning to academia to augment their professional experience and increase their advancement potential and marketability. In the words of current M.P.A. students, here are some of the reasons they sought the M.P.A. degree: A full -time emplo yee with the Environmental Protection Agency writes, \"As I gain more experience as a regulatory agent it amazes me to see the perspective of the regulated community towards the regulations. It is this understanding that I believe is critical in order to fi nd ways to reach those doing the polluting and giving them alternatives to better manage their impacts. It is this dynamic of understanding the social pressures and applying them to my job as a government agent that has interested me in the M.P.A. \" The di rector of a nonprofit agency providing business development services for women writes, \"I seek to gain a broader perspective of the interdisciplinary development field through sharing with the AYSPS community, and consolidate my network in the U.S. \" A par alegal specialist and political refugee from Iraq says, \"Following my graduate studies, I plan to pursue work with a government agency or a not -for-profit organization such as The Coalition on Human Needs, which is an organization working to address the ne eds of low -income and other underserved populations, or CARE. \" A planning official indicates, \"I am looking for a comprehensive post -graduate education that offers relevant research experience. That educational experience will allow me to begin working in a policy analyst position with a state or federal agency. Ultimately I would like to work as a city manager and be responsible for the administration of a local government. \" A lawyer writes, \"Years of practicing law has given me a strong education in the realities of urban economics and how public policy affects the individuals within a community as well as the community as a whole. I am looking forward to learning the underlying theory and expanding my understanding of those factors which drive a communi ty, and being able to apply this knowledge to real world issues. \" AYSPS graduate student organizations were active this year. The newly organized Policy Leaders of Nia , under the leadership of the founding president, Dionne Hill , held a facilitated discus sion with an expert on community based research and development policy in February, provided partial funding to some of its members for a field trip to Egypt, and held a social event at the end of the spring semester to celebrate the end of the academic ye ar and the graduation of several of its members. Gregory Lewis is faculty advisor of the group. The Graduate Student Association , led by Edward Sennoga with faculty advisor Erdal Tekin , held its first meeting of the year on February 6 to unveil an action p lan for the calendar year. They hosted a featured speaker on April 27 and discussed the issues facing America regarding trade with China and India and closed out the spring semester with a picnic at Indian Creek Lodge. The group recently elected new office rs: Eric Sarpong , president, and Robert Salvino , vice president. 21 Doctoral Programs The Andrew Young School continues to have broad international representation within its entering doctoral classes. The cross -cultural exchanges that occur between AYSPS st udents enhance their educational experience and broaden their perspectives on the pressing international issues within each of their academic disciplines. Countries represented by new doctoral students include: Turkey, India, Serbia, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Kenya, China, Nigeria, South Korea, Argentina, Zimbabwe and the United States. Newly Admitted Doctoral Students Twenty -six new students joined the school 's doctoral programs in 2004; 17 in Economics and nine in Public Policy. In the economics program, 1 0 newly admitted students are male; seven are female. Their ages range from 21 to 34 years of age, with an average age of 26. In our public policy program, five are male and four are female. The age range is considerably broader than in the economics progr am, extending from 23 to 48, with six of nine over the age of 30. Interestingly, only four of the 17 economics students are over age 30. But whether the students have had a strictly academic career to date or whether they come from extensive professional b ackgrounds as policy analysts or directors of local governance, a consistent theme between both programs is the desire of the students to make significant contributions to the world by influencing economic development and policy decisions. Professions rep resented in this year 's class of doctoral students reflect a broad range of life experiences, including: a foreign exchange trader, an economist, a credit manager, an engineer analyst, a lawyer, a policy analyst with the Presidential Commission on Policy P lanning in Seoul, South Korea, a biostatistician, an agricultural officer and a president/CEO of a consulting firm. The school 's mission statement is \"to create and disseminate knowledge and analytic methods that are highly valued by policy makers and lea ders in the public, nonprofit and business worlds; and to educate students who are highly qualified and sought after as policy analysts, program evaluators, and designers of administrative systems. \" Without question, this year 's entering class of outstandi ng doctoral students in both programs provides the Andrew Young School with this opportunity. 22 Student Awards, Honors and Scholarship s Honors Day The Andrew Young School of Policy Studies held its Eighth Annual Honors Day Ceremony at the Sheraton Atlanta Hotel on April 20, 2004, to recognize the academic excellence and service achievements of its students.

In addition to the entries in those sections, and to publications listed in \"Papers, Books and Chapters: Published or Forthcoming, \" various ot her projects of economics department faculty are listed below. Academic programs are described in the Office of Academic Assistance section. James Alm is Chair of the Department of Economics. Highlights The Department admitted 17 new doctoral students in Fall 2004, and 14 new M.A. -Ec students. There are now nearly 73 students in the Ph.D. program and 40 in the M.A. -Ec program. In Spring 2004, 2,456 students were enrolled in economics courses; in Summer 2004, 1,074 were enrolled; in Fall 2004, 2,894 were enrolled. The Department hired five new faculty members and is conducting searched to hire more , to create one of the largest economics departments in the country. The Department offers three unique programs in addition to its undergraduate and graduate degrees: Peace Corps Master 's International Program, South Africa Study Abroad Program, and the Summer Policy Internship Program. Economics faculty and staff taught over 170 courses in 2004. Programs Graduate Teaching Assistant Training Program . This pr ogram was created in 2000 to help GTAs in Economics perform well in the classroom. The training in 2004 again was extensive. GTAs videotaped some portions of their lectures, which then were analyzed by Harry Dangel, director of the Center for Teaching and Learning. Dangel worked with the GTAs to identify areas for improvement. The responses from GTAs who participated in the program were very positive. The GTA Undergraduate Teaching Committee for 2004 -2005 consists of Shelby Frost , Jon Mansfield and Elizabet h Nelson . Faculty Recruitment . The Department welcomed five new professors in 2004. Visiting Assistant Professor Douglas Campbell completed his doctoral dissertation at Georgia State University on development impact fees in March 2004. His specialties i nclude State and Local Public Finance, Tax Incidence, Local Banking Markets, and Spatial Econometrics. Assistant Professor Gary A. Hoover received his Ph.D. from Washington University in St. Louis. His work generally deals with governmental institutional efficiency in operations, and his specialties include Public Policy Analysis, Public Finance, Income Distribution, and Labor Economics.

The Department continued its Research Experiences for Undergraduates summer intern program, under the supervision of Neven Valev and with funding from the National Science Foundation. Ten students from around the country attended the 7 -week program, which ran from May 31 to July 16, 2004. Interns were from Georgetown Universi ty, Georgia State University, Notre Dame University, Rice University, University of Michigan, Shippensburg University, the University of Georgia, the University of Washington, State University of New York at Albany, and Williams College. Research projects included business cycles convergence in the European Union, tax incentives in the Caribbean nations, the geography of income and poverty in Atlanta, the Head Start Program, and tax reform in Tanzania. The program is very competitive with over 100 applicant s, and many graduates of the program have enrolled in top Ph.D. programs in Economics such as Princeton, Minnesota, and UNC, Chapel Hill. Indonesian Masters Program . The Indonesian Masters Program currently consists of five Ph.D. students. Three students from the first year program and two from the second year program remained in the U.S. to finish their studies at AYSPS and complete their doctorate degrees. The students from the first program have now finished almost all their coursework and have begun t heir dissertation writing process. The program is co -directed by James Alm and Jorge Martinez -Vazquez . South Africa Study Abroad . The May 2004 economics study abroad program, South Africa: Its Evolving Socio -Political Economy, was a rousing success. Nine students from Georgia State University and Morehouse College traveled to South Africa for a 2 -week study abroad program, under the direction of Glenwood Ross of Morehouse College. While in South Africa, the students were presented with lectures on various aspects of the South African economy and of sub -Saharan Africa in general. Lectures were held at the University of Pretoria, The University of Cape Town, and the Department of Trade and Industry in Johannesburg. In addition to learning about the economy, the students were exposed to South African culture, history, and political environment through museum visits, city and homeland tours, and trips to the informal settlements. A major highlight of the trip was the visit to Robben Island, where the students learned more about the struggles of Nelson Mandela and other anti -apartheid political prisoners. The study abroad program was split between the Pretoria/Johannesburg area and Cape Town. While in the Pretoria/Johannesburg area, the student travelers stayed at Olympic athlete training facilities on the campus of the University of Pretoria; in Cape Town, lodging was provided at the Victoria Junction Hotel near the Cape Town waterfront. Students also had overnights at a safari game park and in a tribal village . The 2004 Economic Studies Abroad in South Africa Program was a great learning and fun experience for all, and the 2005 version promises to be just as fact - and fun -filled as its predecessor. The 2005 Program will take place during the GSU Maymester.

Its faculty, staff, and graduate students are actively engaged in research and public service projects that inform public policy and enhance the quality and effectiveness of policy implementation and evaluation in the Unit ed States as well as internationally. Academic programs are listed in the Academic s section of this report . PAUS faculty are very active in the Centers and Programs of the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. In addition to work found in those sections, and to publications listed in \"Papers, Books and Chapters: Published or Forthcoming, \" various other projects are listed below. Lloyd G. Nigro is the Chair of the Department of Public Administration and Urban Studies. Programs and Activities M.P.A. Advis ory Board. The M.P.A. Advisory Board was created by PAUS faculty in 2001 to assess the M.P.A. curriculum to ensure that its graduates meet the needs of today 's public agencies and non -profit organizations. Board members, many of whom are AYSPS alumni, hold administrative positions with local, state and federal agencies and departments, as well as nonprofits. These positions include that of city administrator, tax commissioner, department head, program director, budget and finance director and non - profit exe cutive director. The board has developed a mission that emphasizes making a positive impact on public service by taking on the primary role as a resource to faculty in communicating the necessary skills, knowledge, ethics and values required to practice in the public sector. This board also offers the program a more formal connection with its alumni. In 2004, the M.P.A. Advisory Board continued to expand its activities. The Board meets often, and an informal reception on November 4 allowed the Board to int eract with students and staff and continued a tradition of Board to student interaction. Board members and other experts in the past have addressed questions about finding jobs, making contacts in the public and nonprofit sectors, and the skills necessary to succeed in public service. Katherine G. Willoughby , Robert Eger III , and Theodore H. Poister are the PAUS faculty liaisons with the M.P.A. Advisory Board. M.P.A.

Poister, John Clayton Thomas, and Sonali Ballal . 2003 Public Opinion Poll: Georgia Department of Transportation , Department of Public Administration, Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, Georgia State University, May 2004. University of Northumbria Collaboration . The PAUS department created a study abroad, student exchange program for students at The University of Northumbria 's (UNN) School of Arts and Social Sciences, located in Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K. The joint Georgia State University/University of Northumbria (UNN) exchange program is designed to give students a better understanding of comparative government and international policy. PAUS Director of International Student and Faculty Exchanges is Carol D. Hansen . Through this semester -long exchange between two prominent research universities, graduate students in the fields of Public Administration and Urban Policy Studies will gain an awareness of international policy and practice, the tools necessary for work within foreign cultures, and the managerial skills needed to function effectively i n a global setting. In learning about British institutions, participants will also learn about the U.K. and its role within the European Union. The program has one-semester duration, and occurs each fall. Participants will travel to UNN, where they will ta ke courses examining public administration and policy analysis and will reap the benefits of living and learning in a new cultural setting. Participation permits Georgia State students to establish a collegiate relationship with the faculty and students at UNN, some of whom will travel to Georgia State the following spring term. The program is open to graduate students in the Public Administration and Urban Studies department of the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies. Students must have completed at le ast three courses in the M.P.A. or M.S. -UPS program. Students will enroll in two modules of study at UNN. Each of these modules converts to 6 hours of Georgia State University semester hours. Upon successful completion of these modules, students will be aw arded credit for 12 hours of coursework toward the graduation requirements of their M.P.A. or M.S. -UPS degree. The Aviation Program . The aviation program continued to grow in 2004. New students joining the program included traditional students recently gr aduated from high school, transfer students from other universities, professional s entering to complete degree programs, and students from other countries. Forty - nine students successfully completed flight training practicums. All graduates during the year reported successfully obtaining employment in the aviation industry and several entered graduate programs. One 2004 graduate accepted a position with the National Transportation Safety Board.

Some of these programs link the college with the community. The other activities and projects aim to inform the debate on public policy in the metropolitan Atlanta area, the state of Georgia, and the nation through research and e ducation. The issues that are addressed include those associated with the structure of urban area s, government tax and expenditure policy, education, program evaluation, social policies, and economic development. Some of the specific topics include the eva luation of pre-K programs, analysis of the transition from welfare to work, studies of teacher retention, a multi -year study of public housing transformation, and studies of the labor market opportunities of low -skilled workers. Domestic Programs also hous es the Georgia Poll, a quarterly public opinion poll of Georgia residents, and Atlanta Census 2000 \u2014 a portal that allows easy mapping of census data. Funding comes from a variety of governmental, foundation, and business sources. David L. Sjoquist is the Director of Domestic Programs. Domestic Programs has extensive experience in measuring performance of programs in areas as diverse as education, transportation, and information systems. The evaluation and policy analysis projects have included many studie s of educational programs. The office 's work in analyzing the effects of Georgia 's innovative HOPE Scholarship and in evaluating the nation 's first universal pre -kindergarten program has brought national attention. Evaluations conducted by the office 's staff range from large -scale statewide and national programs to school based innovations. Activities The Fiscal Research Center provides nonpartisan research, technical assistance and education in the evaluation and design of state and local fiscal and econ omic policy, including both tax and expenditure issues. (See the Fiscal Research Center section.) The Neighborhood Collaborative , an extension of The Atlanta Project started by the Carter Center, provides the University with a means of enhancing research, teaching and service through more effective partnerships with its urban environment and neighborhoods. (See the Neighborhood Collaborative section.) The Nonprofit Group is devoted to informing the discussion of policy issues confronting nonprofit organiz ations in the Southeast. (See the Nonprofit Studies Program section.) Research Atlanta is a private , not-for-profit public policy research organization that studies public policy issues affecting the metropolitan Atlanta region. (See the Research Atlanta section.) AtlantaCensus 2000 is a collaborative effort between the Atlanta Regional Commission and the Fiscal Research Center to support a Web site that provides access to the 1990 and 2000 Censuses of Population and Housing, allows the creation of maps, and contains reports focused on the Atlanta region. Atlanta Outreach Consortium is an inter -university collective working to bridge community outreach and service -learning programs at Georgia State University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Clark Atlan ta University, and Emory University. Domestic Programs houses the Director of the AOC. The Educational Policy Group provides research and recommendation s on issues related to education policy in Georgia. 1 For a complete listing of AYSPS Active Research Sponsored Grants from CY2004, see the Appendix: Report on External Funding. 113The Georgia Administrative Data Project involves the development of a database built on the unemployment insurance records from the Georgia Department of Labor and welfare records for the Georgia Department of Human Resources. Regional Leadership Forum (RLF) is a metro Atlanta citizen 's organization de dicated to creating discussions by citizens and leaders about the future of the Atlanta region. Although independent, RLF is housed at the Andrew Young School, which partners with RLF. (See the Regional Leadership Forum section.) Survey Research and the G eorgia Poll provides data collection and expertise in data management, study design, and project management. The Survey Research Lab has worked on projects varying widely in size, scope, methodology, and complexity, ranging from collecting the opinions of students within Georgia State University to conducting national public opinion surveys. The Urban and Regional Analysis Group provides research and recommendation on issues related to urban and regional policy in Georgia. (See subsequent section ). Proje cts A Comparison of RDD and Cell Phone Surveys. Charlotte Steeh. Since very little research has examined the impact on surveys of the exploding growth of wireless communication devices, this study assesses the extent to which these devices are likely to c hange telephone surveys. Results from two national surveys, one using the usual list -assisted RDD sample and the other employing a sample of mobile telephone numbers, are being compared. The analyses look for significant differences between surveys along f our dimensions \u2014coverage, nonresponse, data quality, and relationships among variables. Methodological factors, such as the number of attempts, the percentage of sample numbers whose status as working or nonworking is indeterminate, and the effects of Caller ID, are also explored. The basic hypothesis underlying all analyses is that there are major differences between the two modes along each dimension. ($176,296) Communities in Schools of Atlanta Evaluation Consulting (CISA). Mark Rivera and Craig Gordon. Semi -structured interviews, focus groups, and a document review are being conducted to develop recommendations for improvements to the CISA evaluation plan and reporting practices. The CISA program aims to help reduce absenteeism in schools and to provide caseload assistance to children and families with need. ($4,315) Higher Education Policy Influence: A Formative Evaluation of the Lumina Foundation Policy Portfolio. Gary Henry. Funded by the Lumina Foundation for Education, this project examines the Foundation 's impact on higher education policy in the United States. The goals of this formative evaluation are three -fold: 1. To examine the mechanisms (internal research, grants, and contracts) for producing policy -relevant research, with particular attent ion to the importance of the Foundation 's internal research capacity. This goal includes development of a program theory linking research and research capacity to improving higher education access and success , and the educational attainment of the adult le arner; 2. To describe the research portfolio produced to date, the associated reports, and other means used to communicate the findings and recommendations (if any) and to assess the outcomes observable thus far, focusing on those that have been most succe ssful and those that have the greatest potential for influencing higher education policy; and 3. To propose a research agenda (or alternative agendas) that seems likely to maximize higher education policy influence. ($277,343) Georgia 's Third Grade Retent ion Policy. Gary T. Henry. Funded by the Georgia Department of Education, this project studies the 2004 implementation of Georgia 's third grade retention policy and remediation activities. Since 2000, state law requires for third graders in Georgia to pass a criterion - referenced reading assessment for promotion (without appeal) to the fourth grade. The provision was an effort to eliminate social promotion and attempts to ensure that all children will be able to read at the third 114grade level before being pro moted. To maximize the useful information for policymakers, educators, parents, and students in Georgia public schools, there are two primary purposes for the evaluation: 1. The use of available CRCT and administrative data to assess differences in Spring 2004 pass rates for the third grade reading assessment, including differences attributable to the categories of children specified in No Child Left Behind (NCLB) and differences attributable to the demographics or other characteristics of schools; and 2. T o examine the effectiveness of programs designed to prepare students who initially did not pass the reading assessment to pass the assessment by the end of Summer 2004. ($100,000) Office of School Readiness: Registry Project. Gary T. Henry and Judith Otto son. The project offers accurate data on children 's Pre -K experiences and provides a base for future research and evaluation. The project conducted for the Office of School Readiness consists of three major data components: class rosters, lead teacher cred entials, and resource coordinator reports. The project is in its fourth and final year. ($776,252) Performance Outcome Measures Project: Georgia Division of Aging. Charlotte Steeh . For the third year, the Georgia Division of Aging Services participated in a national evaluation coordinated by Westat to learn how in -home services have helped those who receive them and how satisfied clients are with their care. Approximately 366 telephone interviews were conducted with a sample of clients who received Persona l Support Services during the previous six months and with an independent sample of 353 caregivers. ($49,480) Regional Leadership Forum. Steve Rieck. Funded by the Woodruff Foundation, this project is dedicated to creating discussions by citizens and lead ers about the future of the Atlanta region. ($150,644) Studies of Pre -K Programs in Georgia. Gary T. Henry . There are two current longitudinal studies evaluating early childhood programs across the state of Georgia. The first longitudinal study is a five -year evaluation of Georgia 's Pre -Kindergarten (Pre -K) Program. This study followed a probability sample of over 3,000 four -year-olds from 203 Pre -K classes selected from across the state. Student outcomes, including teacher assessments of academic and beha vioral skills and promotion, have been collected and analyzed annually. Current efforts are focused on analyzing data and report writing from the fifth year data collection. Previous years ' reports are among the most downloaded documents from the Web site. The second longitudinal study, also known as the Georgia Early Childhood Study, began in July 2001. This study samples approximately 650 children participating in a variety of preschool settings, including Pre -K, Head Start, and other preschool facilitie s serving four -year-olds. This study will help determine the impact of the various types of preschool experiences on children 's future school success, as well as investigate the reasons behind parents ' choices for child care arrangements. Children will be followed into the first grade. Each year, data collection efforts will include: individualized standardized assessments with sampled children in key developmental areas, teachers ' and parents ' assessments of children 's skills and behaviors, classroom obser vations rating the quality of the classroom environments, surveys with teachers and program directors regarding early childhood education, and surveys with parents about preschool arrangements and family demographics. Laura Henderson and Bentley Ponder co-manage the Georgia Early Childhood Study. The Office of School Readiness funds both of these projects. (Total funding for the two projects is $2,071,892.) Summer Enrichment for Four -Year -Olds. Bentley Ponder, Dana Rickman, and Gary Henry. Funded by sever al foundations and the Department of Early Care and Learning, this study estimated the effects of an eight - to ten -week summer program on readiness for kindergarten. Understanding the Impact of Preschool Policy. Gary T. Henry. This project studies the imp act of alternative types of preschool and other childcare and expands the work of the Early Childhood Study (ECS), which began in 2001. This project is funded by the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University. ($199,845) 115Reports Gary T. Henry, Laura W.

Former president Jimmy Carter established TAP in 1992 as part of the Carter Center, wher e it operated until its move to Georgia State University in 1999. TAP initiated the development of a university -wide unit called the Neighborhood Collaborative. The Collaborative assists in implementing the GSU commitment to work in partnership with the co mmunity to improve the lives of Atlanta residents. Its goals are: 1) to build community capacity, 2) to focus additional research, teaching and service on community capacity building and improved social policy and programs, and 3) to improve access to huma n services for families and children, especially in low -income neighborhoods. Douglas Greenwell is the Director of the Neighborhood Collaborative and The Atlanta Project. Donna Bulbulia is Director of the Senior Corps Programs. During 2004, the Neighborho od Collaborative has been successful in engaging the university and community in partnerships, especially those relating to the senior population. In addition, students have been recruited and employed as graduate research assistants, Learn and Serve stude nts, Work Study students and student assistants. Projects Senior Corps Programs is funded through the Corporation for National Service. Since January 2002, the Neighborhood Collaborative has earned three grants from the Corporation for National Service to administer three senior corps programs: Foster Grandparents, Senior Companions, and Retired Senior Volunteer Program. The Senior Corps programs recruit, place, and train volunteers aged 55 years and older in volunteer positions within the community. The p rograms operate in Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties. Ten employees are joined by two graduate research assistants to carry out this exciting program with more than 1,500 senior volunteers. Foster Grandparent Program is funded through t he Corporation for National Service as a senior initiative through which people 60 years of age and older provide a service to young children with exceptional or special needs. By providing assistance in schools, hospitals, detention centers and early childhood centers, Foster Grandparents often provide services that limited staff cannot. The volunteers who meet income guidelines receive a stipend ($2.65 per hour) for the work completed. Foster Grandparent volunteers serve 230 children and their families. I n 2004, 120 Foster Grandparents provided service at 14 different educational settings including a new \"3 o'clock \" project in Fulton and DeKalb counties. Of these 120 volunteers, 14 seniors have provided over 10 years of service to the children and their fa milies. The annual federal grant is $488,547 plus approximately $143,000 in matching funds from various sources. Senior Companion Program is funded through the Corporation for National Service. The Senior Companion Program is a senior initiative through which people aged 60 years and older provide assistance and friendship to elderly individuals who are homebound and often living alone. Senior Companions provide the services that frail elderly persons need to live independently. The volunteers who meet in come guidelines receive a stipend ($2.65 per hour) for the work completed. Senior Companion volunteers served 176 fragile seniors and their families; many acted as an umbrella of support for seniors who receive services through the state Medicaid waiver pr ogram. In 2004, 53 Senior Companions provided services at six different service agencies in Fulton and DeKalb counties. The annual federal grant is $203,010 plus approximately $99,000 in matching funds from various sources. Retired Senior Volunteer Progra m is funded through the Corporation for National Service. The Retired Senior Volunteer Program invites adults, aged 55 and older, to use their experience and skills to assist 1 For a complete listing of AYSPS Active Research Sponsored Grants from CY2004, see the Appendix: Report on External Funding. 124communities in need. RSVP volunteers serve in various capacities such as mentorin g, companionship, administrat ion, advoca cy, and as tour guides, neighborhood watch ers, Meals on Wheels volunteers and more . The RSVP program serves five metro Atlanta counties : Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett. The RSVP program in DeKalb and Gwin nett counties serves as the official source for senior volunteers in the county. A total of 426 new volunteers were recruited and placed during 2004 for a grand total of 1,325 volunteers. The annual federal grant is $180,935 plus approximately $111,000 in matching funds from the counties and other sources. The GSU Rialto Center for the Performing Arts has been added as a station for utilization of senior volunteers through the RSVP program. Senior Corps Matching Funds . Each of the three senior volunteer pr ograms requires matching funds. The agencies that volunteers work for provide both cash and in -kind resources to support the program. Local county governments also provide grants to support the programs. The United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta and other cha ritable organizations provide additional dollars. These sources generate approximately $350,000 annually. City of Atlanta Weed and Seed Program. TAP was commissioned to provide an evaluation of the Weed and Seed Program implementation. The Weed and Seed Steering Committee is co -chaired by the Mayor of Atlanta and the U.S. Attorney. The project goal is to maintain and strengthen the combined efforts of law enforcement, residents and community agencies to weed out drug abuse and establish drug prevention strategies. For more than three years, TAP has been the external evaluator to measure the results of the Weed and Seed goals and objectives. Partners in the program include the Federal Drug Enforcement agencies, City Law Enforcement agencies, Atlanta Public Schools, Atlanta Housing Authority, MARTA and a host of community service providers. Residents from Mechanicsville, Pittsburgh and Vine City neighborhoods, the target communities for the program, provide direction on priorities and encourage participation from the neighborhoods. Current funding is $16,000. Youth Enrichment Project. GSU Learn and Serve student Kehli Faulkner developed a summer youth enrichment program funded by the Enterprise Foundation. The project operated for 12 weeks at the Dunbar Eleme ntary School facility, and worked with about 85 children. The youth engaged in creative art, dance, drama, academics and recreation. They visited local enrichment sites and produced a pageant to demonstrate their learning at the conclusion of the summer. T he staff was comprised of seven college students and five high school students, who also provided leadership and served as role models for the youth. The Enterprise Foundation is seeking to repeat the program in Summer 2005. Atlanta Community Access Coali tion. The Atlanta Project facilitated the development of a coalition of community health providers and linked them with a social service network. The purpose was to increase access to health care for the uninsured and underinsured. This coalition successfu lly competed for federal assistance to implement this cooperative system that brought health care to a population with little or no access to care. The coalition includes Grady Hospital, Fulton Department of Health and Wellness, West End Medical Center, So uthside Medical Center, Oakhurst Medical Center, St. Joseph Mercy Medical Center, Palmetto Health Council, Morehouse School of Medicine, Emory School of Public Health, The Atlanta Project and the Pathways Network. TAP has kept the contract to develop the G eographical Information System through the TAP data and policy analysis unit for over four years. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance and Earned Income Tax Credit. This project was implemented by the Atlanta Fulton Family Connection coalition of which the Nei ghborhood Collaborative is a member. The project provided free income tax preparation to families with limited income. In addition, the project promoted knowledge of the Earned Income Tax Credit, which is available to working families with children and low income but often is not utilized. The Neighborhood Collaborative took this project to the Atlanta Outreach Consortium (Clark Atlanta University, Emory University, Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia State University) for sponsorship in recruiting volunteer faculty and students to support the VITA tax preparation. Student volunteers from the four universities assisted with tax return preparation for low income Atlanta families. AmeriCorps VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America). The Neighborhood C ollaborative in partnership with the Office of Community Outreach and Partnership continues to sponsor VISTA volunteers in their 125yearlong service requirement. One new VISTA volunteer was placed at the Neighborhood Collaborative. The VISTA was involved with the community capacity building efforts of the Neighborhood Collaborative, developing public relations, and recruiting volunteers for the Senior Corps. The Atlanta Project continues to focus on building capacity in urban neighborhoods. TAP works to facilitate partnerships between residents and connect them with the resources they need to carry out plans for their neighborhoods and families. Two primary tools for this work are: 1. Data and Policy Analysis. The Atlanta Project established this unit in 1993 t hrough a contract with a Georgia Institute of Technology professor. Staff and students are hired to produce vital geographic and statistical data that can be extracted by address throughout the urban geographic area. TAP has developed a philosophy and prac tice of assisting community groups in understanding both the value and the ways in which data supports planning and implementation of change. The concept of Democratization of Data is the goal of this activity. 2. Carter Collaboration Center. This computer la b has 30 workstations, software for training, access to the Internet and the Group System V software to assist group planning and decision - making. Groups from various neighborhoods, local non -profits, the United Way, Georgia State, and Atlanta and federal governments have utilized this resource during 2004. The Group System V software was used in an off -site organizational development retreat with the Georgia Department of Corrections last summer. Specialized training for volunteers to staff the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program was conducted in the lab. Community Capacity Building The Neighborhood Collaborative Community Capacity Building activities are headquartered at City Hall East. Satellite offices in the metro Atlanta area include Gwinnett Cou nty, Cobb County, and Clayton County. These offices enhance Community Capacity Building, with activities such as the following: 526 senior volunteers were r ecruited, trained, and placed into Senior Corps Programs to volunteer in their communities. Senior Corps volunteers participated in the 2004 Mayor 's Walk in the summer; they also traveled to the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tenn., and Callaway Gardens in Pine Mountain, Ga. NC hosted five \"Senior Corps Recognitions \" and four special events for se nior volunteers. An average of 100 people attended each event ; the events support the collegial relationship between the volunteers as well as recognize the outstanding work they accomplish. RSVP volunteers in DeKalb and Cobb counties made baby blankets, sweaters, booties, dolls, cancer pads and lap robes. These articles were given to hospitals, child advocacy agencies and hospices in five local counties. Some of the lap robes were sent to a nursing home in North Carolina. NC sponsored GSU service -learning and VISTA students from the Office of Community Outreach and Partnership. The students are involved in recruiting volunteers, creating the Neighborhood Collaborative Web site, and evaluating community programs. Gwinnett County RSVP participated in the Ho liday Helper Program sponsored by GUIDE. The volunteers gathered items to fill bags to be distributed to children in need throughout the county. The bags contained not only toys but also essential items like clothing and hygiene products. Gwinnett County has been involved in Senior Day Out and the Senior Health Fair. Several displays are located in senior centers, residential facilities and grocery stores throughout the county. Gwinnett County placed volunteers in the Georgia Cares program, a horse farm th at provides therapy for autistic children and a work center for the mentally disabled. Fulton County has volunteers involved in two literacy programs at Antoine Grave High Rise and Wheat Street Towers. A partnership has been established with Cobb County S chool System to support the RSVP program. They will provide tutors and mentors for students throughout Cobb County, from pre - kindergarten through high school. 126Environmental Policy Program1 The Environmental Policy Program is a major research and training center that has the objective of enhancing the quality of environmental policy in the state, the nation and in countries throughout the world. Engaged in scholarly research projects focused on water resources and environmental and natural resources policy and management, the Program has provided policy advice to the government and private sectors since 1993. The Program has established collaborative partnerships between other universities and organizations that include Oak Ridge National Laboratory, as we ll as the University of Georgia and Emory University. The Program 's water resources consortium, the Georgia Water Planning & Policy Center , is a partnership between Albany State University ( Flint River Water Planning & Policy Center ), Georgia Southern Univ ersity ( Coastal Rivers Water Planning & Policy Center ) and Georgia State University ( North Georgia Water Planning & Policy Center , housed in the Environmental Policy Program). Each university center includes a research program and an academic program in Wa ter Resources Management and Policy. The programs are available via videoconferencing and Internet technologies, and are offered in the evenings to accommodate working students and career professionals. Other major research areas in the Program include B rownfields management and the study of economic behavior in various policy settings. The Experimental Economics Laboratory maintains research and academic training in experimental economics. The Economics program offers a specialization in Environmental Po licy, and students can earn a Ph.D. in Economics, with a specialization in Environmental Policy. Ronald G. Cummings is the Program 's Director. Programs Brownfields Program. The Brownfields Project assists policymakers with new ideas in the economic manag ement of revitalizing toxic industrial sites. The project uses a unique database of commercial and industrial properties in Atlanta to quantify the reduced economic potential of Brownfields and their possible spillover effects onto surrounding properties i n the most comprehensive manner possible, and to disseminate this information in a manner accessible to policy makers, community leaders, and all stakeholders.

(Submitted February 2004, $108,000) The Environmental and Experimental Economics Laboratory With support from the Geo rgia Research Alliance, the Environmental & Experimental Economics Laboratory is a state -of-the-art facility unique to the Southeast. It functions as a research center to assist in determining valuations for environmental damages, assessing market values f or non -renewable resources and projecting future economic resource needs. Its primary use is for studies that focus on critical behavioral relationships between policy rules, individual perceptions of the incentives associated with these rules, and outcome s. Ronald G. Cummings is the Director of the Environmental & Experimental Economics Laboratory. 128 The 40 -station lab provides a facility for research and teaching in the areas of environmental regulation compliance, non -market valuation, a transition to th e use of markets, and collective decisions in the management of environmental resources. Critical policy questions concern the response of individuals to proposed policy initiatives. Through the laboratory, users gain insights into the impact of the use of markets for emissions trading and the extent of environmental regulation compliance . The laboratory also allows evaluation of methods for obtaining individual valuation of environmental resources. For example, in the area of Fiscal Policy, it provides a m eans of testing the behavioral aspects of various programs designed to enhance tax compliance and of investigating the conditions under which voluntary contributions will be successful in providing collective goods. The Portable Laboratory The Portable L aboratory consists of 30 Pentium notebook subject stations, a notebook server and portable hubs. With travel cases designed specifically to transport the facility, staff can easily conduct laboratory experiments throughout the nation and abroad. Laborato ry Activities and Visitors The lab was moved to its new location in the Andrew Young School in June and has undergone a complete renovation, expanding from 24 research subject stations to 40 stations. Computers were upgraded with a grant from Georgia Sta te University. The first experiments in the new lab were held in December. Outreach Kathleen Banks represented the Program, and the Andrew Young School, to the National Wildlife Foundation 's summer program for high school students held at the Clark Atlan ta University campus, May 2004. Summer undergraduate interns Stephanie Hill (from Notre Dame) and Menbera Shiferaw (from University of Georgia) worked with Ragan Petrie and Paul J.

The report was released in Spring 2004. Sustainable Funding for the Arts: What Can Atlanta Learn from the Detroit Experience. Michael Rushton. This report, released by Research Atlanta in Summer 2004, follows upon Rushton 's 2003 study \"Sustainable Funding for the Arts: Earmarked Taxes and Options for Metropolitan Atlanta. \" In 2002, voters in Metro Detroit narrowly defeated a proposal to increase the property tax in order to provide funding f or nonprofit arts and cultural organizations. In this new report, Rushton combines the precinct - level referendum results with Census data for an empirical study of who favors increased cultural funding. The results are interpreted for Atlantans in terms of what local advocates of an earmarked tax for the arts might learn from the Detroit experience. AYSPS Graduate student Wenbin Xiao played a key role in providing research assistance. Culture and Public Finance: A Symposium. Michael Rushton, Editor.

Work on this project is ongoing. Activities 2004 Nonprofit Executive Leadership Roundtable. The fourth annual Nonprofit Executive Roundtable was held May 5, 2004, at the Court Salon of the Student Center on the Georgia State University campus. Nonprofit leaders and scholars in the region, many of whom were in attendance for their third or fourth year, met for a morning of presentations and discussion on two topics of particular import to tod ay's nonprofit sector: accountability relationships between nonprofits, the public, and donors, and government contracting with faith -based organizations. Professor Michael Rushton of the AYSPS Nonprofit Studies Program served as Master of Ceremonies for the Roundtable, and a special welcome was given by Dean Roy Bahl . The 2004 event was underwritten by the Northern Trust Company. The keynote speaker for this roundtable was Professor Evelyn Brody, J.D., of the Chicago -Kent College of Law, Illinois Insti tute of Technology. Professor Brody is a nationally prominent expert on the legal, economic, and social issues affecting nonprofit organizations. She is currently involved with the American Law Institute 's project to draft \"Principles of the Law of Nonprof it Organizations, \" and her keynote address was inspired by this work. Professor Brody noted that in the push for nonprofit accountability, many forces operate simultaneously on the governance and operation of a nonprofit organization. She focused in her pr esentation on the role and the limitations of current law in providing for accountability. Professor Brody was joined during the second half of the morning by Robert Franklin, Presidential Distinguished Professor of Social Ethics at Emory 's Candler Schoo l of Theology, and Professors Michael Rushton and David Van Slyke of the AYSPS Nonprofit Studies Program, for a panel discussion of the present and future role of government funding for faith -based organizations. Professor Franklin set the stage with openi ng remarks on the issue, and moderated the subsequent panel discussion. Professor Brody provided some legal context to the \"Blaine amendments \" adopted by many states, and the constitutional amendment that has been proposed in Georgia. Professor Rushton ana lyzed the pros and cons of the government funding of faith -based organizations from an economic and organizational theory standpoint. Professor Van Slyke talked about public attitudes towards government funding of faith -based organizations and the implicat ions for \"crowding out \" of private philanthropy, referencing recent Nonprofit Studies Program survey research. 145Program for Rehabilitation Leadership1 The Program for Rehabilitation Leadership (PRL) provides human resource development and organizati onal development services to public and not -for-profit organizations that provid e services and supports to individuals with disabilities.

It represents a unique collaboration between the private sector, which supports the research and sets the research agenda, and the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, which administers the organization and oversees the research process. For 33 years, Research Atlanta, Inc. has investigated the causes of and analyzed alternative soluti ons to problems that affect the quality of life in metro Atlanta. Research Atlanta advances sound public policy, not a political agenda. Deborah McCarty is the executive director of Research Atlanta. Research Atlanta enjoyed yet another successful year i n 2004. The three studies released this year generated significant discussion among citizens and key leaders about issues as diverse as the arts, tax allocation districts, and size of city council. Research Atlanta reports explore the issues and details an d offer a panoply of options to consider when crafting policy responses. Research Atlanta was contacted by various nonprofits and interest groups about conducting a record number of client studies in 2004, many of which may be forthcoming in 2005. Sound p ublic policy requires more than simply informed policy makers. It also demands an informed citizenry engaged in debate about the issues. To engage citizens in such debate, Research Atlanta maintains an extensive Web site, provides technical assistance and education to community groups and collaborates with other organizations to present special programs. In 2004, Research Atlanta posted information from its reports and continued to host a search engine at its Web site to enable individuals to easily educate themselves about community problems. Research Atlanta took steps to reach out to the community, and created an Open Space Forum in March 2004 to discuss the study released in May 2003. A diverse group of people attended the event, hosted at The Coca -Cola Company in Atlanta. In attendance were board members, community leaders, and representatives from the entire metro Atlanta area. The panelists at this event were: Mayor Shirley Franklin , City of Atlanta; Elise Eplan , Vice President for Special Initiative s, The Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation; Lee Ross , Corporate Vice President, Reveal Technologies; Alycen , Tunnell - Spangler & Associates, and co -author of the Open Space Study ; and Clay Long , Chairman, Advisory Council of the Georgia Land Conservat ion Partnership, Partner and Co -Chairman of McKenna Long & Aldridge, and co -author of the Open Space Study . Research Atlanta 's second forum of the year was an Arts Forum in June 2004 to discuss the study released May 2004 about lessons learned from Detroi t arts initiatives. A diverse group of people attended the event, which was hosted by Right Management and held at The Capital City Club in Brookhaven. In attendance were board members, community leaders, and representatives from the arts community from th e entire metro Atlanta area. The highlights of the event were the panelists: Michael Rushton , Georgia State University Associate Professor of Public Administration and Urban Studies and author of the Arts study ; Raymond King , SunTrust Senior Vice President for Community and Governmental Affairs; and Bill Nigut , Atlanta Regional Arts and Culture Leadership Alliance Executive Director. The success of these events was evident in press coverage and interest in the community. In 2004, Research Atlanta particip ated in activities around the country. Deborah McCarty attended the ARC LINK trip to Boston and the GMA conference in Savannah with key Atlanta business leaders. She also serves as a member of Mayor Franklin 's City of Atlanta Parks Commission. Efforts hav e been made by Research Atlanta in 2004 to help continue to grow the Metropolitan Atlanta Mayors Association (MAMA) in partnership with The Regional Leadership Forum (RLF), the Georgia Municipal Association (GMA), and the Andrew Young School of Policy Stud ies (AYSPS). McCarty has 1 For a complete listing of AYSPS Active Rese arch Sponsored Grants from CY2004, see the Appendix: Report on External Funding. 151been an ongoing participant in all the Executive Committee meetings of the MAMA organization. MAMA 's initial meetings were also held to create a potential bi -partisan metro caucus of the Georgia General Assembly, which is scheduled to have meetings in early 2005. This year, Research Atlanta partnered with the Regional Leadership Forum by sharing staff member Jennifer Kreidler . This relationship has strengthened the bond with RLF and enabled programs to grow further. Research Atlan ta originated on the premise that an informed citizenry engaged in serious debate about the problems affecting their community is essential for good public policy decisions. More than a \"think tank, \" Research Atlanta engages the public in the kind of discu ssion needed to resolve issues. In partnership with WABE, Georgia Public Television, Leadership Atlanta, the League of Women Voters of Atlanta -Fulton County, Regional Leadership Forum, and the Atlanta History Center, Research Atlanta has taken steps to inform the community through forums about the issues it researches. Past forums have addressed regional decision -making, private management of public schools, the impending water crisis; air quality and attracting the middle class back to the central city. Research Atlanta has a wealth of information available on its Web site at www.researchatlanta.org. Reports include metro Atlanta issues as diverse as city services, air quality, public service delivery, governance, public finance, education, housing, and p overty. Particularly valuable reports for today 's policy debates include the TAD study, the Open Space study, Sustainable Funding for the Arts: Earmarked Taxes, and Options for Metropolitan Atlanta and Reinventing Municipal Governance: Programmatic Innovat ions from the New Generation of Big City Mayors. Research Atlanta 's work consistently receives excellent media attention. The Atlanta Business Chronicle released executive summaries to tie in with the release of all full reports released by Research Atla nta. Prominent news reporters such as Maria Saporta and Tom Sabulis of The Atlanta Journal -Constitution and Wendy Bowman -Littler of the Atlanta Business Chronicle are regular attendees of Research Atlanta events. Research Atlanta has continued to strengthe n its relationship with The Atlanta Journal -Constitution , the Atlanta Business Chronicle and WABE in 2004 in many areas including press releases, press coverage, forum attendees, and report releases.

Members provide ideas and suggestions, serve as a sounding board of our ideas, and represent us in the community. Our board members are cheerleaders, advise us on our program developmen t and even participate in it, support our important events, and help us raise funds. There is one board meeting a year, in the fall; although from time to time , special called meetings are held. We ask each board member to find an area of particular inter est in the School, e.g., one of our centers, programs or departments. We want them to learn about that program in some depth, try and get involved with what they do, and then help us find intellectual and practitioner support as well as core funding for that program. This is a long -term activity (it takes time to develop programs and to raise funds). Board members provide critical perspective, and their advice and leadership are very important to us.

More than 84% of the university 's faculty and staff contributed to the Faculty Staff Campaign. The Andrew Young School was again a leader in the university community, with 93% of its faculty and staff contributing. These strong demonstrations of commitment and approval are important as funding is sought from outside sources. Percentage of Faculty and Staff State Charit able Giving Campaign Each fall, Georgia State University participates in the State Charitable Giving Campaign. This campaign helps to fund a number of nonprofit agencies that provide service to communities across the state of Georgia. Donors can select f rom a number of options for allocating their gifts. In 2003, the Andrew Young School exceeded 90% in staff and faculty giving to this important campaign. The 2004 campaign is still in progress, and the Andrew Young School expects to reach 90% participation again this year. Friendraising in 2004 We continue to reach out to our alumni, donors, supporters and the community at large through a variety of mediums. The Briefing , our college newsletter, continues to be widely read and praised for its content and quality. Through The Briefing , we are reconnecting with alumni interested in The Andrew Young School and its growing reputation. Again this year, we hosted a number of special events, including the Coca -Cola Student Leadership Conference and the Non profit Roundtable. These events introduce our college and our programs to individuals throughout the community. The move into our new building also gave us the opportunity to bring alumni and other supporters in for tours. Corporate and Foundation Giving In add ition to alumni and faculty/staff support for our programs, we receive funding from the corporate community as well. Among these corporate donors are United Parcel Service, The Coca -Cola Company, Coca -Cola Enterprises, Bank of America and Archer Daniels Mi dland. 202 Memorial and Honorary Scholarships Ending Balances (Endowment and Operating) FY2001 FY2002 FY2003 12,400 10,503 10,787 Coca -Cola Endowed Scholarship Fund Established: March 2001 217,153 E.D.

Highlights The mission of the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies ' public relations office is to promote a favorable environment for student and faculty recruitment, private giving and public funding by raising awareness of the college and its accomplishments among essential constituencies. It supports the Andrew Young School goal of becoming the highest rated policy school in the South and one of the highest ranked in the nation by 2007 (AYSPS 2002 -2007 Strategic Plan). The office advocates the use of planned and purposeful marketing communication ideas, strategies and tactics. Cynthia Pembroke coordinates external communications activities for the college, and Avani Raval coordinates publications and events. The AYSPS audience is widespread. It includes potential students, alumni, and parents; potential faculty and research associates; members of the State Legislature; peer resea rchers; government, nonprofit and business leaders in the Atlanta, regional, national, and global arenas; decision makers at national and international development agencies such as USAID and The World Bank, as well as the leaders in foreign governments wit h whom the AYSPS works; the media; and the community at large. Ensuring its research is widely known is the key to accomplishing the Andrew Young School 's mission : to \"inform the debate \" on local, state, national and global policy. The public relations o ffice strives to reach its many audiences via its efforts in media relations, event management, and publications. Media Relations The Andrew Young School was often cited in 2004, including media hits in such places as The Wall Street Journal, The Chronicl e of Higher Education, Los Angeles Times, The Baltimore Sun, Detroit News , and The Scientist . Atlanta Business Chronicle and The Atlanta Journal -Constitution - the hometown daily newspaper whose influence drives much of Metro Atlanta and North Georgia 's media decisions - are important media outlets for the School, and often include expertise from the Andrew Young School. Topics covered in the media range widely. Samples include taxation of the wealthy, effectiveness of school vouchers, health insurance tax credits, regional transportation, obesity, foreign -born scientists, economics of sports, and gay spending power. See the \"Media Hits \" section for a list of media hits from 2004. Georgia State University 's Department of University Relations assists in And rew Young School media relations. A designated public relations specialist works with the School, writing and distributing press releases on college research, programs and events and proactively pitching experts who can discuss newsworthy topics. Reporters from local and national media outlets often contact University Relations seeking commentary for their news stories, and the department matches them with faculty members in the Andrew Young School who have the appropriate expertise. Many of the school 's professors are frequently sought for interviews on a wide variety of subjects. Media hits in The Atlanta Journal -Constitution are tracked daily, and distributed to the School. Similarly, Bacon 's news clippings are sent periodically from the University Relati ons office. Publications The Briefing . A key component of the school 's visibility efforts is The Briefing , the Andrew Young School 's newsletter showcasing research, teaching and outreach by the School 's faculty, students, alumni and friends. The Briefing is sent three times a year to 12,000 constituents (4,800 alumni and 7,200 friends, about half of which are colleagues, deans and department heads, and many of which are government officials), and is featured on the School Web site. Feedback is impressive r egarding the content and presentation, and the sheer magnitude of activity that the School consistently achieves. Jennifer Echols continues to write The Briefing , bringing clarity to the issues, and setting stories in context with what is happening in the world. The publication 's annual highlight is the Research Issue. 204Annual Report . Each year the School conducts a thorough accounting of what it has done, producing an approximately 200 -page report. Hardcopies of the report are distributed to select peers a nd are available for distribution throughout the year, and announcement cards of the annual report 's availability on the Web are sent to 12,000 alumni and friends of the school. Academic Brochures . Academic brochures are available for each of the Andrew Y oung School programs. In 2004, updated brochures were made for the Bachelor 's, Master 's and Ph.D. in Economics, for the M.P.A., and for the Bachelor 's and Master 's in Urban Policy Studies. An updated brochure for the Ph.D. in Public Policy was underway at the turn of the year. Viewbook . The Viewbook is a full -color brochure with broad overview of the School. With a pocket in back, it is useful for a wide array of events, in which specific information targeted toward each event is placed. Plans were underwa y in late 2004 for a new edition of the Viewbook in Spring 2005 to incorporate the new visual identity of the School, as well as to reflect new faculty and research associates, and the new building. Web site . The Andrew Young School 's Web site (www.andrew youngschool.org) offers a wide array of information about the School. \"Expert pages \" are maintained for AYSPS faculty and research associates, including contact information, vitae, bios, and photos. \"Story ideas, \" news releases, and the online experts guide provide assistance for the news media. An active calendar site and informational intranet area prove useful for faculty and staff. Information on academic programs, courses and syllabi are popular with current and prospective students, as well as those t hat advise them. Availability of working papers online continues to grow. Stories from The Briefing are featured prominently throughout the site. The core AYSPS site moved to a new server in 2004, allowing growth in interactivity, traffic reporting, and sy stems security. The Web site averaged about 12,000 visitors per month in 2004; it finished the year with 12,286 visitors, 22,362 visits, and 78,012 pages visited during the month of December. Dean 's e-News . The Dean 's e-News occurred quarterly in 2004, s erving as a vehicle for sharing achievements within the School, and for identifying news to be distributed to external audiences. Robin Steinbrenner oversaw the Dean 's e-News . Plans are in progress for a move to a weekly Dean 's e-News in 2005. Georgia Sta te Magazine and The Villager . The Georgia State University Office of University Relations promotes the Andrew Young School along with other colleges on campus through its publications, including Georgia State Magazine , a 40 -page glossy magazine published q uarterly for alumni, donors, legislators and the university community (circulation: 110,000), and The Villager , the university 's official faculty/staff newspaper, which is distributed biweekly to all employees (circulation: 3,500). Advertising . The Andrew Young School advertised its programs in the Fall 2004 edition of the Eastern Economic Journal , and the October 2004 edition of the Southern Economic Association Journal . Additional materials are created as needed, including event brochures, job placement announcements, and others. PowerPoint templates with AYSPS identity are offered to researchers; publications are in adherence to the University 's identity guide. Georgia State University 's professional photographers are often used. The research centers pr oduce a wide array of publications, including working paper series, fiscal research notes, child policy brochures, and conference brochures. In planning for an updated Viewbook in early 2005, plans are underway to work with the centers in establishment o f a new and more defined branding mechanism across the many AYSPS public relations outlets. At year 's end, consideration and evaluation of an Alumni Electronic Newsletter was underway, with the objective of fostering a sense of greater connectedness betwee n alumni and the Andrew Young School. 205Events The Andrew Young School is a vibrant place, with a busy calendar of events , as demonstrated on the routinely updated Calendar on the AYSPS Web site. Each of the academic departments and centers within the Scho ol has a wide array of research and outreach initiatives, with a corresponding lot of events. The Dean 's office coordinates events within the college to ensure minimum overlap and maximum attendance per event. Avani Raval oversees scheduling of rooms, coor dination with University photographers and audio/video production crews, catering, and event promotion for AYSPS events. Event highlights in 2004 included: Honors Day . Honors Day is an annual, special day in the life of the college. Exemplary students ar e recognized in a formal reception, dinner and awards ceremony. See the \"Student Awards, Honors and Scholarships \" section of this report for further information. Commencement Receptions . Three commencement receptions were held in 2004. With the move to th e new building in July, the receptions moved from the Student Center (Spring) to the lobby of the new building (Summer and Fall). The new building 's two -floor lobby with wide open views of the Five Points streetside, glass -railed stairs to the Vault studen t area, prominent AYSPS signage and the glass railing of the mezzanine above provide an exciting atmosphere for the receptions. Academic Department and Research Center Seminar Series . The academic departments and research centers of the Andrew Young Schoo l keep their calendars full of activities that benefit both the School and the broader AYS audience. Lecture series include: The Child Policy Speaker Series, Dan Sweat Lecture Series, Applied Econometrics Workshop Series, Environmental Policy Program Semin ars and Environmental and Experimental Economics Seminar Series, Fiscal Research seminars, Health Policy Center Conference, International Studies Program lecture series and conference, Microeconomic Theory Seminar Series, Nonprofit Executive Roundtable and seminars, Public Administration and Urban Studies seminars, Research Atlanta Forum, and the Roun dtable for Atlanta -Area Experimentalists. Seminar speakers came from such places as Harvard University, Purdue University, the University of Michigan, and the Johannes Kepler University Linz. Units within the School host a myriad of events, including those off -site. For example, the Department of Economics hosted a reception for peers and alumni at the American Economics Association annual conference in San Die go in January. For further detailing of these events, see the research center sections of this report. The School participated in Georgia State University 's yearly reception for the State Legislature. Due to budget constraints, the event occurred in 2004 in the morning at the Capitol, rather than in the evening at the Freight Depot. Krispy Kreme doughnuts were available, the college 's work was featured on displays, and key faculty responded to lawmakers ' queries. Coordination between the AYSPS and other u nits on campus occurred in 2004 via monthly PR Council and PR Executive Roundtable meetings, hosted by the Office of University Relations, to review events underway as well as major publications and media initiatives. AYSPS also works in conjunction with s uch offices as the Office of Development, routinely providing materials and assisting these offices in their work for the AYSPS, and working groups such as the College Webmasters Group, which assisted the University in selection of the Goog le search tool o n its Web site. Measuring Success The efforts of the Public Relations office of the Andrew Young School continued to pay off in 2004. U.S. News Rankings . The Andrew Young School of Policy Studies is again among the top institutions that offer a public a ffairs degree in the 2005 Edition of U.S. News & World Report 's exclusive rankings, 206\"America 's Best Graduate Schools. \" In just six years, the school 's overall ranking jumped 10 places, from 36th in the 1999 Edition to 26th in 2005. More than 250 public aff airs programs were considered in the rankings. Even more exciting, the School now ranks among the top ten percent of these schools in four specialties: Public Finance and Budgeting (5th), City Management and Urban Policy (12th), Public Management and Admin istration (16th) and Public Policy Analysis (21st). The School also measures its effectiveness in reaching its audiences by other \"rating systems. \" In a School with a focused mission on \"informing the debate, \" it is important to look at the \"rate\" of such things as invitations to present, citations, number of requests by government and nonprofits for task force membership and reliance on AYSPS research, and number of requests to speak for public forums on policy topics of import to the community at large. AYSPS continues to track these indicators in its yearly annual report. Measurements in 2004, such as faculty working in over 40 countries, over 180 papers delivered at other universities and professional meetings, 4,174 students taught, and many requests f or expert advice from the Georgia General Assembly, showed that the Andrew Young School is reaching its audience, and continues to achieve its mission to \"inform the debate \" on local, state, national and global policy. 207Media Hits Journalists from dozens of local, regional, national and international publications and broadcast outlets call on the Andrew Young School 's faculty experts each week for information and commentary on breaking news stories and features. In 2004, researchers and data from t he Andrew Young School were featured in about 2 39 stories. The college encourages its faculty - as employees of a taxpayer -funded research university - to make themselves and their work available to the public through these news outlets. The list below rep resents a sampling of the year 's major media hits. The Andrew Young School of Policy Studies . U.S. News and World Report 's \"America 's Best Graduate Schools 2005 \" Rankings for Public Affairs were released with the following results for the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies: The Andrew Young School of Policy Studies (GSU) moved up in the overall Public Affairs ranking s to 26th out of 253 schools - up from 31st in 2002; The School is also ranked 5th in Public Finance & Budgeting; 12th in City Management & Urban Policy; 16th in Public Management Administration; and 21st in Public Policy Analysis.
