From the preventive vaccine for cervical and liver cancer to the first therapy ever proven to extend the lives of patients with metastatic melanoma, immunology has already led to major treatment breakthroughs for a number of cancers. Every cancer type is unique, though, and immunology and immunotherapy are impacting each cancer in different ways. Explore immunotherapies by cancer type and explore different kinds of treatment, why immunotherapy matters, and how to support cancer immunotherapy research. Bladder Cancer The first FDA-approved immunotherapy treatment\u2014Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin cancer vaccine\u2014was for bladder cancer in 1990. Brain Cancer Cancers of the brain and nervous system are relatively rare but very serious. Immunotherapy is showing significant promise. Breast Cancer New breast cancer immunotherapy treatments have shown great promise, with the potential for long-term success. Cervical Cancer Three preventive cancer vaccines are already helping to stop cervical cancer, with new clinical trials now available to patients. Childhood Cancer Immunotherapy offers a potential way to treat childhood (pediatric) cancer without the damaging, long-term side effects of conventional treatments. Colorectal Cancer There are several FDA-approved immunotherapies for colorectal cancer, for which patients are in urgent need of new treatment options. Esophageal Cancer Immunotherapy for esophageal cancer is being explored to reduce recurrence as a first-line treatment option. Head and Neck Cancer Immunotherapy offers treatment options for patients with cancers of the mouth, throat, voice box, sinuses, nose, and salivary glands. Kidney Cancer Immunotherapy for kidney cancer\u2014also called renal cell cancer\u2014has tremendously changed the overall survival of patients. Leukemia There are several FDA-approved immunotherapies for leukemia (leukaemia) and ongoing research demonstrates even greater potential for new treatments. Liver Cancer In addition to the first FDA-approved hepatitis B cancer vaccine, immunotherapy increases the immune response to liver cancer. Lung Cancer Immunotherapy is a promising option for advanced lung cancer, alone or in combination with treatments like chemotherapy or surgery. Lymphoma Several FDA-approved immunotherapies offer treatment options to children and adults with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Melanoma Immunotherapy has changed the way melanoma is treated. In particular, checkpoint inhibitors are responsible for the increasing survival rate... Multiple Myeloma Immunotherapy for multiple myeloma is a promising new treatment option, with the potential to result in long-term cancer remission... Ovarian Cancer Research into immunotherapy for ovarian cancer is promising, especially since more treatment options for patients and oncologists are urgently... Pancreatic Cancer Pancreatic cancer has few treatment options, so pancreatic cancer immunotherapy research is vital to providing patients with new hope. Prostate Cancer With a cancer vaccine and checkpoint inhibitor already approved, immunotherapy research offers new hope to patients with advanced prostate... Sarcoma Immunotherapy for sarcoma has some success cases, including the earliest known instances of spontaneous regression, although sarcoma cancer immunology... Skin Cancer Skin cancers are common, often diagnosed at an early stage, and among the first cancers to respond to immunotherapy. Stomach Cancer Immunotherapies, including checkpoint inhibitors and targeted antibodies, offer promising new treatment options for stomach (gastric) cancer patients. Uterine (Endometrial) Cancer Immunotherapy for uterine (endometrial) cancer is an emerging area of research and treatment, especially for patients with advanced cases.... "}
