Axis Community Health is the sole provider of primary care services for the indigent and uninsured population of eastern Alameda County/Tri -Valley. Axis received designation as a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in 2009. Axis has moved quickly to expand services, capacity and efficiency, with achievements including the receipt of Level 2 PCMH (Patient -Centered Medical Home) designation, full implementation of electronic health records at all sites and in both medical and behavioral health services, and the implementation of integrated behavioral health services. Axis has also received recognition from HRSA (US Health Resources and Services Administration) for exemplary access to care in its prenatal services. Based on demographic and public health data and population growth trends, ACA implementation would add 9,000 - 10,000 Medi -Cal-eligible patients to the pool of potential Axis patients. The service capacity needed to provide these patients with access to medical homes would be in excess of 75,000 visits annually \u2014more than doubl e the 36,000 visits Axis provided in FY 12/13.

UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FY 14/15 FY 15/16 FY 16/17 PEI 1.B/C Addition to School -Based Mental Health Consultation in Elementary - High Schools $500,000 $1,000,000 $1,000,000 There are significant health -related issues faced by unaccompanied youth in Alameda County. Healthcare Services Agency has assessed that a large number of unaccompanied youth are enrolled in the Oakland Unified School District and other school districts with large Latino student populations. While this issue requires an urgent and immediate response, ongoing services may be required to address the long -term needs of this population. Healthcare Services Agency has a significant investment with 26 school health centers in 14 school districts and school -based behavioral health services in 160 schools throughout the county. This new program will leverage these investments and expand capacity of the various \"portals to healthcare\" to effectively address trauma, other health concerns and caregiver support needs of unaccompanied youth. Program Strategies: Establish \"No Wrong Door\" resources for school and community -based providers to enable billing for providing trauma- informed behavioral health care services. Mobilize the School Health Centers (including Fuentes Wellness Center, REACH Youth Center in Ashland) to serve unaccompanied youth, working with lead health providers to address some of the barriers to financing their care. Partner with school districts throughout the County to implement strategies for early identification and triage to address urgent health and mental health issues. Mobilize a team of one Clinical Case Manager and two Parent Partners (with Spanish and Mama language capacity) to interface with various partners to ensure that unaccompanied youth and their families/caregivers have appropriate access to health services and supports. Deploy youth peer -to-peer outreach and care coordination leveraging our youth development provider community. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 9 Rev. March 2015III.

Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 21 Rev. March 2015FSP 1. Homeless Outreach & Stabilization Team (HOST) Program Description: Multi -disciplinary team engages homeless adults and links them to a range of services with a focus on community services, peer support and the means to obtain and maintain housing. FY 12/13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: See ATTACHMENT B \"HOST Adult Full- Service Partnership Program Outcomes ...through December 2013\". FY 13/14 Progress Report: Implementation proceeding as planned including graduation procedures and transfer (step- up/step down) procedures to lower levels of care including successful transfer s to and from other Level I teams. FY 15/16 Plans: No significant changes planned. Continued implementation of graduation procedures leading to increased flow of HOST partners to lower levels of care. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 22 Rev. March 2015FSP 2. North County Senior Homeless Program Program Description: Multidisciplinary team engages homeless seniors and provides housing with community supports. Provides linkage for family members and offers peer support. For previous FY 12 -13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : Number of clients served: 44 Number of new enrollments: 14 Number of discharges to lower level of care: 14 Number of clients who avoided psychiatric hospitalizations during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 93%, 13 of 14 clients - 6 months: 93%, 13 of 14 clients - 12 months: 93%, 13 of 14 clients Number of clients who avoided medical hospitalizations during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 100%, 14 of 14 clients - 6 months: 93%, 13 of 14 clients - 12 months: 100%, 14 of 14 clients Number of clients who retained housing of their choice during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 84%, 12 of 14 clients - 6 months: 84%, 12 of 14 clients - 12 months: 93%, 13 of 14 clients Number of clients who received primary care serves within the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 100%, 14 of 14 clients - 6 months: 100%, 14 of 14 clients - 12 months: 100% 14 of 14 clients Participants receiving support from NCSHP have had success connecting to primary care services. Supporting participants to receive primary care is critical for the older adult population, many of whom have been disengaged from both physical and mental health services for many years resulting in complex needs that require intensive care coordination. The team meets the challenges that arise for participants when mental health related symptoms, such as paranoid ideation, manifest as behavior that are often received as a barrier to health care services by providers in the community. NCSHP team members use a flexi ble and person- centered approach to support participants to accept care. For example, participants may be open to receiving psycho- education on topics such as diabetes in their home prior to accepting medical care for such conditions. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 23 Rev. March 2015For current FY 13-14 Progress Report : Number of clients served: 37 Number of new enrollments: 8 Number of discharges to lower level of care: 6 Number of clients who avoided psychiatric hospitalizations during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 87% , 7 of 8 clients - 6 months: 100%, 8 of 8 clients - 12 months: 87%, 7 of 8 clients Number of clients who avoided medical hospitalizations during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 100%, 8 of 8 clients - 6 months: 87%, 7 of 8 clients - 12 months: 100%, 8 of 8 clients Number of clients who retained housing of their choice during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 87%, 7 of 8 clients - 6 months: 87%, 7 of 8 clients - 12 months: 100%, 8 of 8 clients Number of clients who received primary care serves within the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 100%, 8 of 8 clients - 6 months: 100%, 8 of 8 clients - 12 months: 100% 8 of 8 clients For the current year 36 of 37 NCSHP participants have spent 0 nights as homeless. The team has had success working with participants to utilize resources in their communities and natural supports to find shelter and housing. Early in the year the team promoted a peer support counselor who had been with the program since the inception of the program. While the promotion was well deserved and the staff person is still with the organization, the absence of this team member left a personnel and service gap. The team strategized for appropriate terminations between the staff person and participants. The team is actively pursuing qualified candidates with lived experience to fill the position by June 2014. For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15 -16, FY16 -17 Plans : The NCSHP team will serve a total of 40 partners at any given time in the coming fiscal year. BACS will explore cost effectiveness and client care benefits of providing psychiatry in house and primary care services as part of the organization's continuum of care. BACS considers the increased access health care as a primary benefit to NCSHP participants. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 24 Rev. March 2015FSP 3. Supportive Housing for Transition Age Youth (STAY) Program Description: Provides permanent supportive housing for youth who are homeless, are aged out of foster care, leaving the justice system or residential treatment. For previous FY 12 -13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : On average, STAY served 48 participants who were homeless or imminently homeless at the time they entered the program, thus reducing homelessness in the community. Based on MORS scores and hospitalization and incarceration data provided at the time of enrollment, STAY continued to reduce the number of hospitalizations and incarcerations by stabilizing participants in the community via intensive community based case management services. Of these 73% were safely housed in either permanent or transitional housing. STAY implemented SAMHSA evidence- based practice of Individualized Placement Support/Supported Education to assist these young adults to gain competitive employment, and our first participant in that program obtained competitive employment in May. STAY also successfully implemented three new groups: one peer support group for young women, one DBT group and one peer support group for young men. We also successfully implemented a new housing subsidy plan that encourages participants to engage in productive activities (e.g. employment) to increase their income. 55% of participants who were discharged were transitioned with permanent housing in place and to a lower level of care. The number of participants exiting STAY on a planned basis to the same or lower level of care was 90% compared to 75% during the 2011/12 fiscal year. Over the year we increased the percentage of participants who were linked to primary care from 33% to 50%. For the first half of the fiscal year an average of 44% of participants were seeking employment (e.g. engaged in supportive employment programs or actively working with STAY team to explore employment options). For the second half of the fiscal year the number of participants seeking employment increased to an average of 53%. For current FY 13 -14 Progress Report: STAY served 56 participants during the fiscal year who were homeless or at risk of homelessness and living with a significant mental health disability. As evidence of working towards our objective of assisting participants with maintaining housing stability, of the 56 served: 36 (64%) were placed in and maintained either permanent or transitional housing. During this period STAY discharged 14, 11 of which were planned discharges. Of the 11 planned discharges: 7 (64%) exited the program with permanent housing. 6 (55%) exited the program and went to a lower of care. 5 (45%) exited the program to the same level of care. During this period progress was made with regard to competitive employment. Through the SAMHSA evidenced- based practice of Individual Placement Support /Supported Employment (IPS) program which helps participants obtain competitive wage employment, STAY was able to provide Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 25 Rev. March 2015employment services to 28 participants (50% of the total number of participants served). As evidence of working towards our objective of increasing the number of participants who are competitively employed, of the 28 served by IPS participants: 12 (42%) were engaged in competitive employment at some point during the FY'13- 14. Of the 12 employed, 5 (41%) have maintained their jobs for at least 3 to 6 months. With regard to employment, STAY also became a Department of Rehab vendor which will allow us to provide participants with extra support as they work towards their vocational or educational goals. In support of our objective to increase the number of groups offered through STAY: During this period we developed and implemented two Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) groups to assist participants with managing mental health symptoms as well as an ongoing Drop In Group for TAY that focuses on Independent Living Skills, peer connection and support, and improvement of activities of daily living. In summary: Based on Milestones of Recovery Scale (MORS), for FY'13- 14 the average number of participants that were in the 6 - 8 range on the scale (i.e. rehabilitated or in full recovery) increased slightly to approximately 40% suggesting that the trend from FY'12- 13 of decreasing hospitalizations, incarcerations and community stabilization continued; and the number of participants that exper ienced planned discharges to the same or a lower level of care increased from 90% to 100%. During the upcoming 3 year period STAY will continue to work towards starting a monthly family group as well as building upon our efforts to increase the rate at which we link participants to primary health care (and effort to be significantly supported when FFYC opens a Wellness Center in Fall '14). For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15 -16, FY16 -17 Plans: In support of the overall outcome goal of improving the participant's condition and/or life through the services we provide, STAY will focus on increasing the number of participants that retain housing as well as supporting participants with achieving their employment goals. FSP 4. Greater Hope Project Program Description: Engages homeless people through street outreach, through the HOPE Project Mobile Health Clinic and community referrals. Once engaged, the program offers housing, intensive mental health wrap- around service coordination, medication management, counseling, educational/vocational support, recreational opportunities, and peer mentoring. For previous FY 12 -13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : 32 clients avoided hospitalization - in emergency room or psychiatric facility for 3 months after enrollment in the Greater HOPE program; 35 after 6 months of enrollment; and, 36 after 12 months of enrollment. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 26 Rev. March 2015 34 clients retained housing of their choice fo r 3 months after enrollment in the Greater HOPE program; 36 for 6 months after enrollment and 38 for 12 months after enrollment in the Greater HOPE program. 30 clients received primary care services within 3 months after enrollment in the Greater HOPE program; 35 after 6 months in the program and 41 after 12 months in the program. Many of these individuals were highly visible in the Southern, Eastern, and Central part of Alameda County as well as high end users of emergency services until they were subsequently housed and began receiving Greater HOPE services. There continues to be a far greater need in the community than there are resources. Affordable housing in Southern and Eastern Alameda continues to be a challenge. Additionally, vacancy rates are so low in these areas, land lord are choosing to work with subsidized housing program less often and this can make finding housing challenging. With regards to moving people on to other housing in the community, there are few affordable or subsidized options in Southern and Eastern Alameda county. Moving on for people in the Greater HOPE program, often means uprooting everything and moving to Oakland to a brand new and unfamiliar community. For current FY 13 -14 Progress Report: Greater HOPE is in th e process of determining those 5- 7 participants that could move on to a lower level of care and receive a housing subsidy through an alternative source. Some of these participants may continue to receive Greater HOPE services during a transitional period. Conversely, other participants may be at a place in their recovery that they are able to find employment and become increasingly impendent of outside resources. Simultaneously, Greater HOPE continues to get referrals and engage in outreach to some of the m ost highly visible homeless members of our community. For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Plans: Greater HOPE will continue to target housing, case management, mental health, psychiatric, vocational rehabilitation and primary care services to 43 severely mentally ill adult participants The program will be moving to Hayward within the next 6 months. As we move people out of Southern and Eastern Alameda county into more affordable housing in Central and Northern Alameda County, the program will be more centrally located and thus be accessible to program participants. Greater HOPE also will continue to consider strategies to address the need to broaden our efforts within the scope of available resource. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 27 Rev. March 2015FSP 5. Forensic Assertive Community Treatment (FACT) Program Description: Forensic Assertive Community Treatment (FACT), a program of the East Bay Community Recovery Project, is funded by MHSA Prop 63 through its contract with Alameda County Behavioral Health Care. FACT specifically serves persons who have a history of excess utilization of the criminal justice system \u2014jail and court services \u2014and psychiatric and medical emergency services. These individuals have long histories of living with severe mental health and co-occurring substance misuse and other medical issues. FACT follows the ACT model, which utilizes a multi- disciplinary treatment team to provide assertive outreach and engagement to this population. Once engaged, FACT provides subsidized housing, intensive case management, psychosocial habilitation or rehabilitation for daily living, psychiatric evaluation and treatment, medical triage, substance misuse counseling and assistance to detox/treatment, individual and group peer support, employment and educational assistance, and crisis intervention services. FACT provides the vast majority of its services in the community, meeting our partners \"where they are.\" For previous FY 12 -13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : The program implemented the use of the Milestones of Recovery Scale as a tool to support the teams clinical dec isions in determining partner's readiness for transition to a lower level of care. Several FACT partners have successfully graduated and transitioned to Wellness centers for continued support. The FACT program continued to reduce and in most cases eliminate its participant's involvement in the criminal justice system and or their need for psychiatric emergency services. Partners continued to be supported in their efforts for beginning and or returning to school and competitive employment. All graduates are living in affordable housing that is subsidized independent of the program. The graduates participated in our monthly leadership group which plays an integral role in the mentoring of new partners and the planning for and participation in our on- going com munity meetings. Streamlining of measures compendium administered to partners to effectively and efficiently measure change over time Increased support and technical assistance from an external evaluator to help prepare Annual Program Report For current FY 13 -14 Progress Report: FACT is continuing to graduate individuals from the program and transition them to a lower level of care for continuing less intensive services. As of July 2014 FACT has graduated and transitioned a total of 14 participants all of whom have stabilized and have not accessed psychiatric or medical emergency services or been incarcerated in at least 6 months or longer. These graduates are now receiving treatment services through wellness centers, service teams, or through private providers in the community. For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Plans: Continue implementation and graduation plan for partners. FSP 6. Transition to Independence (TIP) Program Description: Provides intensive mental health services to transition- age youth who are experiencing severe mental illness, aged out of foster care, leaving the justice system, or residential treatment. For previous FY 12 -13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : TIP served a total of 37 clients. On average, participants' hospital admissions in the first 12 months after enrollment was decreased by 41%; number of participants enrolled in schools (GED, community colleges, UC system) increased by 27%; 95% participan ts are housed (14 participants Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 28 Rev. March 2015obtained independent housing through MHSA and Section 8; 13 participants retained housing of their choice (living with parents or family members); number of participants who are employed increased by 8% (competitive and supported employment). One of the biggest challenges was the lack of permanent housing and competitive employment for TAYs. In order to encourage independent living for our TAYs, participants are encouraged to apply for affordable housing opportunities in different cities and counties. In terms of employment, participants are encouraged to apply for supported employment, volunteer opportunities, and vocational trainings to build up their resumes. Based on a Total of 37 participants Psychiatric Hospitalizat ions Number of psychiatric hospital admissions: o 12 months prior to enrollment 86 o First 12 months of enrollment 35 o Decrease in number of hospital admission 41% Education Number of participants in school or taking classes o 12 months prior to enrollment 6 o First 12 months of enrollment 10 o Increase in number of participants in school or taking classes 60% Housing Number of participants who obtained independent housing of their choice: 14 Number of participants who retained housing of their choice (living with parents or family members): 13 Number of participants who are homeless: 2 Employment Number of participants who are employed: o 12 months prior to enrollment 0 o First 12 months of enrollment 0 o Most recent 12 months of post enrollment 3 o Increase in number of participants who are employed 8% For current FY 13 -14 Progress Report: TIP serves participants who live throughout Alameda County. For the current year, TIP collaborated with FERC/Transitiona l Age Youth- Family Member to increase support to our participants, family members, and care takers as well as increasing their skills in learning and implementing WRAP. For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Plans: Continue to support the transition of TAYs to independent living by obtaining or retaining housing of their choice, by completing educational goals, and by obtaining competitive employment. Expand services to 40 TAYs per year. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 29 Rev. March 2015FSP 7. CHOICES for Community Living Program Description: This FSP is a transformational progra m for Service Teams that integrates supportive housing, supportive employment, peer counseling and strength- based and person- centered case management to enable clients to graduate into a fuller life in the community without the need for the Service Team. FY 12/13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Throughout the year, one hundred and eighty two (182) unique Partners were served from three different cohorts in the CHOICES Program. CHOICES celebrated its first graduation event on October 31st, 2013 with fifty -eight (58) Partners from the first cohort successfully completing the program. Partners and their families were extremely proud of their accomplishments. Many Partners shared about their journey publicly at the event. Each Partner received a framed letter from President Obama congratulating them on their accomplishment. Thirty -four (34) Partners were actually discharged from their Service Team. Partners that did not achieve fully graduation will continue to work on their recovery path while still needing the additional supports provided by the Service Team staff. While all stakeholders in the CHOICES Program were planning the first graduation event, five (5) additional teams were being oriented toward starting a third cohort in November/ December of 2013. The orientation process involves engaging the managers of each program to insure that the organization and new CHOICES case manager from that team are aligned with the vision and values of the MHSA/CHOICES Program. In addition, there are technology and documentation requirements that each team must become oriented to as well. The second cohort continued their journey with fifty (50) active Partners out of the original (57) Partners who enrolled in the CHOICES Program. Housing Services O utcomes: Eighty -nine percent (89%) of the CHOICES Partners from the first two cohorts who sought housing services reported that they were in their preferred or most preferred housing. Seventy -two percent (72%) of CHOICES Partners from cohort #1 had been able to maintain independent living or improved their independent living environments prior to graduation. Sixty- five percent (65%) of CHOICES Partners from cohort #2 were able to maintain their independent living or improved their independent living environments by February 2014. Employment Services Outcomes : Seventy -seven (77) CHOICES Partners from the first two cohorts who sought supported employment (IPS) services achieved their preferred or most preferred employment outcomes. This represents a Seventy -three percent (73%) success rate. Fifty-eight (58) Partners received job placements in competitive employment jobs. Forty -two (42) Partners worked for more than 90 days in these placements. Some Partners started the CHOICES Program with pre- existing competitive employment jobs. Wellness, Recovery and Resiliency Outcomes: Survey instruments were conducted by Consumer Research Assistants designed to measure changes in functioning, well -being, recovery and quality of life. The annual surveys consisted of an hour long interview and a compilation of (212) items from several integrated survey instruments. These surveys were measured upon admission in the program and yearly thereafter. Almost every recovery marker showed a statistically significant improvement in overall Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 30 Rev. March 2015functioning. In cohort #1 there was a 24% improvement in living situation; a 15% improvement in talk/get together with family and a 12% improvement in being comfortable about money resources. In cohort #2 there was a 21% improvement in living situation; a 17% improvement regarding their Stage of Recovery and a 15% improvement regarding their perceived progress. Challenges: During the CHOICES Program, seventeen (17) Partners required acute hospitalization. CHOICES Recovery Coaches and Personal Service Coordinators continued to provide support to these Partners resulting in eight (8) of those Partners continuing with the CHOIC ES Program after discharge from the acute facility. Additionally, eleven (11) Partners became incarcerated while participating in the CHOICES Program. The CHOICES staff continued to provide support to these Partners and seven (7) of these Partners were able to continue in the CHOICES Program after being released from jail. Partners reported no significant change in some of the following areas: o The way things are in general with my family o Feeling safe from victimization o Indicators for substance abuse o Takin g medications just as they are prescribed o Losing control of behavior Team Facilitation and Accountability : Facilitation of Team Meetings that integrates services from three different domains and organizations from nine different team cultures continues to be a challenge. The domains of housing, employment and recovery coaching each have their own language, bes t practices, values and perspectives. It should be noted that the Personal Service Coordinator and their supervisor do not directly supervise the other domains that are at the table. Coordinating the various services/service providers and strength- based p erson- centered treatment planning in collaboration with the Partner both continue to be challenging for the teams to accomplish; even though there is a great benefit to the diverse perspectives that are shared with everyone in the team. Staff/Systems Cha nge Outcomes Reported but not Quantitatively Measured: Change in how Housing, Employment and Recovery Coaching Programs organize, supervise and deliver services because of the CHOICES Program. Change in CHOICES staff approaches to working with clients on their recovery. Change in broader BHCS system approach to working with clients on their recovery. Improvements in CHOICES team integration of working among the four domains (i.e. a model for disseminating this out to the larger BHCS system.) Change in non- CHOICES service team staff in their approach to working with clients on their recovery. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 31 Rev. March 2015FY 13/14 Progress Report: The third cohort has become increasingly engaged with housing, employment and wellness classes at the CHOICES Learning Center. The program continues to adjust the approach based on the continuous quality improvement process that staff and Partners are actively engaged with. The second cohort is actively preparing for graduation. It became very clear with the first cohort graduation that primary care and community psychiatry are resources that need to be engaged early in order to get Partners well connected before graduation. The CHOICES all- staff meeting continues to provide educational opportunities to integrate best practices into the services being provided. So far, there have been presentations on how to provide supported educational opportunities for Partners that may want to pursue a career path that requires a certificate or degree. There have been presentations on benefits, housing first, and managing transitions as individuals and as a program experiencing a significant degree of change. FY 14/15 Plans: CHOICES Policy Committee, CHOICES Operations Group, Service Team Directors and Partners are reviewing what we have learned in CHOICES that has worked very effectively to help facilitate the process of recovery and eventual graduation from Service Teams to a fuller life in the community. It is clear from these focused conversations that the dedicated resources of recovery coaches, employment specialists, housing specialists and a recovery learning center with a program coordinator are necessary to continue the MHSA transformation of sixteen service teams in twelve programs, .The CHOICES Program is reviewing the most effective approach to utilizing these existing resources to support the 3,500 consumers on these service teams; as well as the staff at all levels to continue to support recovery journey progress and graduation from service teams to a fuller life in the community. FY 15/16 Plans: The CHOICES staff in the domains of employment, housing and recovery coaching/wellness classes can be effectively re sourced to serve at least two hundred (200) consumers from 12 Service Team sites each year. The transition from a three year CHOICES program to a set of resources that will be more fully integrated into twelve (12) Service Team sites will take this year to work out all of the challenges with this change in the program. This change will allow consumers at each of these 12 Service Team sites to access IPS employment supports, educational supports, housing supports and wellness/recovery supports when they are ready to become active in any of these targeted services. The Program Director will be responsible to insure effective integration of the best practices from these three domains into the (12) Service Team sites as well as a continuation of integrating strength -based person -centered and accountable team practices in each of these programs. FY 16/17 Plans: The resources from the CHOICES Program will be fully integrated into all Twelve (12) Service Team sites serving over 200 consumers every year. The Service Teams will be successfully graduating one hundred (100) or more Partners every year. Consumers from each site will be able to access classes focusing on recovery in each of the domains of wellness as soon as they express an interest, such as WRAP, wel lness, community Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 32 Rev. March 2015resources, and graduation readiness. Consumers from each site will be able to get an employment specialist to work with them on obtaining competitive part time or full time employment as soon as they express an interest. Consumers from each site will be able to learn about creating a home for themselves and what options and resources are available to obtain affordable housing. Consumers will have a place to go to find peer support, learn and grow and discover their hopes and dreams to create a better life for themselves in the community. FSP 9. Behavioral Health Court (BHC) , Transitional Assertive Community Treatment (TrACT) Team Program Description: TrACT (Transitional Assertive Community Treatment) a program of the East Bay Community Recovery Project is contracted through Alameda County Behavioral Health Care using MHSA Prop 63 funding. TrACT, a full service partnership program, is the dedicated serv ice provider for the Alameda County Behavioral Health Court and is to maintain an active caseload of 20 participants. TrACT has been providing intensive wraparound mental health, co- occurring substance misuse and other health related services to participants of the court program since August 2009. This court -supervised program is for adult individuals arrested in Alameda County and are awaiting their court appearance either in custody or in the community. These individuals have a mental health condition that is severe in degree and persistent in duration. This condition has to have been a determining factor for the commission of their offence. BHC/TrACT is voluntary in nature and individuals choose to participate in the court program instead of having their cases proceed in the regular court process. Their charge or qualifying charges, as related to this particular offence, is expunged from their record with their successful completion of the BHC program. For previous FY 12 -13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : TrAct had an average monthly census of 18 partners and six newly enrolled partners. TrAct discharged partners with a completion of at least 6 months in the program, all of which had income, insurance benefits, housing, and primary medical care. TrAct g raduated partners who were transferred to service teams and wellness centers. Streamlining of measures compendium administered to partners to effectively and efficiently measure change over time Increased support and technical assistance from an external evaluator to help prepare Annual Program Report For current FY 13 -14 Progress Report: Seven participants successfully completed the Behavioral Health Court July 8, 2014, and have been referred to a lower level of care for services. This is the largest number of graduates since the court's inception and is a significant accomplishment given that maintaining mental health stability and sobriety over the course of the 12 month TrACT and 24 month BHC program has proven difficult for participants over the first several years of the program. Relapse is often a part of a participants' experience with the TrACT and court program. The key to an individual's ability to commence from the court is their desire to do whatever it takes, with support services from the TrACT team and encouragement from the Court, to achieve sobriety and mental health stability. Permanent housing and housing, employment, and education support services are key to individuals' wellness and recovery efforts as they address common issues of loneliness and boredom and help to meet the hopes and dreams of the participants. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 33 Rev. March 2015For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Plans: Continue implementation and graduation plan for partners. OESD 4A. Mobile Integrated Assessment Team for Older Adults Program Description: Increases access for homebound seniors through the use of mobile geriatric mental health teams. FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Exceeded contracted units of service. Provided 847 home visits to 85 older adults to reduce isolation; decrease 911 calls and ER visits. Through counseling and medication management supported clients with severe mental illness to remain successfully living at home. Client's need case management support to coordinate complex health needs, including chronic disease manage ment and acute medical needs. Many clients have not accessed mental health services in the past and have a lot of unmet needs. FY 14/15 Plans: Increased support for clients through intern partnerships with several Schools of Social Work/Counseling. Currently have 6 interns embedded in program. Close collaboration with Afghan Elderly Association to support older Afghan adults with PTSD/Anxiety symptoms. Holding support groups at Senior Housing that has dedicated ACBHCS residents to increase access to ser vices. The clients who discharged from the program last year had an average length of stay of 5.5 months. It is challenging for clients, especially those who are isolated, to discharge from the program. We hope to develop more step- down options for clients in the future. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 34 Rev. March 2015OESD 5A - 5B. Crisis Response Program - Trivalley & Tricities Program Description: Augment ACCESS services with clinical and peer staff dedicated to East and South County. FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: CRP sites continue to assign to Level 1 and Level 2 Programs. There has been an ongoing need for additional services, particularly Level 2, in East County. Many consumers who had Health PAC transitioned to MediCal. This was not a smooth process and impacted CRP's ability to refer consumers to appropriate resources. Our Livermore office is co- located with FERC (Family Education Resource Center). Initially, this co-location was going to include additional programs, but that did not happen so there are very few employees at this site. The site is located away from many of the other services that our consumers use and there is very little \"walk in\" traffic. East County Crisis Response Programs served 134 consumers in 2013. Fremont CRP served 292 consumers in 2013. FY 14/15 Progress Report: Portia Bell Hume is now offering Level II services in East County . Fremont CRP continues to serve a culturally diverse group of consumers. CRP hired a new psychiatrist in our Fremont site. She has worked with CRP for four years in East C ounty and previously worked at Tri City Community support Center for 14 years so she is very familiar with the population and services available in the area. Though MediCal can still take some time to get approved, the process is running a bit more smoothl y and consumers are able to get services more timely. CRP has met with Livermore PD and Pleasanton PD and can consult and collaborate with local law enforcement as needed. The East County CRP clinician continues to provide community outreach and partner w ith agencies as needed. There is not adequate staffing available at the Livermore site to provide necessary support so Livermore residents will be served at the Pleasanton site for the time being. Once another location is identified, services may resume in Livermore. East County provided services to 147 consumers and to 233 consumers in Fremont in 2014 . FY 15/16, 16/17 Plans: No significant changes planned. OESD 7. Mental Health Court Specialist (Court Advocacy Program) Program Description: Increase access to community mental health services and reduce recidivism through advocacy and release planning for the chronic and severe mentally Ill population in the criminal justice system. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 35 Rev. March 2015FY 12/13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: On a daily basis CAP staff connect criminal justice- involved individuals with mental illnesses to appropriate community service programs based on individual needs. Community programs include mental health treatment providers, case management teams, dual diagnosis services, housing, referrals to sub acute facilities etc. CAP staff provides direct and indirect services such as consultation, assisting other agencies, facilitating connections / services for clients, advocating with attorneys and judges, etc. Currently, the data / statistics on indirect services is not tracked. The only data that is available is for clients who are officially opened to BHCS direct services. Community Impact : On a daily basis, CAP staff work across multiple agency lines to 1. successfully connect clients with appropriate community services, 2. prevent clients from leaving jail without a follow -up care plan and housing, 3. reduce / mitigate the length and impact of incarceration. Without CAP assistance, many clients would have longer jail stays, and, when released, would leave jail without any assistance. We have not had the capacity to track this data. CAP staff work with court personnel to reduce criminal charges and length of time in jail for clients with mental illnesses by securing placements / community care plans. We have not had the capacity to track this data . Challenges: 1. Availability and access to community programs. Community programs may be full or not willing to accept referred clients. 2. A system is needed to gather and track the full range of CAP staff activities. 3. Streamline the jail release process for CAP clients to simplify and make more efficient. 4. Difficulty engaging clients who are resistive to, or refuse services and continue to cycle in and out of jail. 5. Cooperation of some court personnel (such as defense attorneys) who may seek different outcomes for their clients. 6. Mental health education for court staff including judges and attorneys. 7. Relationship- building with court staffs can be challenging due to frequent rotation of judges and attorneys. FY 13/14 Progress Report: There have been some staffing changes over the past year which has impacted coverage in some courtrooms. CAP staff continues to work in selected courtrooms primarily in Oakland and Hayward. CAP staff provides some assistance to clients referred from Fremont and Pleasanton courtrooms. CAP staff assist the new TAY program, REFOCUS, with referrals. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 36 Rev. March 2015FY 14/15 Plans: Adults, over 18, are served by the CAP program including TAY and Older Adults. The numbers vary according to how many in each age group are brought to the attention of CAP staff. CAP staff are located in select Alameda County Superior Courts. For the upcoming three years, (2014- 2017) the CAP staff will continue to assist in diverting eligible individuals from the criminal justice system into community services with the goal of connecting persons to appropriate services and limiting their criminal justice i nvolvement. CAP staff will provide assessments and consultation, and will coordinate placement referrals. The challenges mentioned in the preceding years, will become goals for future Improvements. Some are system - wide challenges and are beyond the control of CAP such as the availability of community resources. Limited resources impact the degree to which CAP is able to be successful in its jail diversion efforts. OESD 8. Juvenile Justice Transformation of the Guidance Clinic Program Description: Provides in- depth assessment and treatment for youth in the juvenile justice system. Creates linkages to community based services and expands on- site treatment in Juvenile Hall. FY 12/13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: One of the strategies for this program is for services to assist with re- integration into the community. This strategy had been implemented by the hiring of a Mental Health Specialist to work with youth and their families upon discharge from Juvenile Hall. This clinician helped with referral s to services and met with families in the community to assist them in making connections to the services. Recently this position became vacant as the staff member took another job and to date the position has not been filled. FY 13/14 Progress Report: In December 2013, BHCS hired a mental health clinician to work in the Transition Center. The role of the clinician will be to assess the mental health, substance abuse, and psychosocial needs of youth and their care givers and link them to service providers in the community. The clinician will also maintain an electronic database to follow -up with families via phone contacts at intervals of 30/60/90 days. Since January 2014 the Transition Center mental health clinician has met with 151 families. Approximately 15% of those families refused services. 35% of the minors were already connected to services in the community. 10% of the minors were connected to services by the Transition Center mental health clinician. 25% were lost to follow -up (runaway, never returned calls, etc.) 10% went to placement and 5% had private insurance. FY 13/14 Plans: Over the next three years, the goal is to meet with 700 families per year for the next 3 years. The Transition Center mental health clinician will meet with 1 to 3 community providers per month to increase the network of service providers that youth will be connected to upon release. Over the next three years the goal is to boost the number of families who are connected to services from 10% to 30%. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 37 Rev. March 2015OESD 9. Multi -systemic Therapy (MST) Program Description: Provides in -depth community -based assessment and treatment for youth in the juvenile justice system. MST partners with the primary caregiver and other key systems (Education, Probation) to understand the multi -systemic drivers of delinquent behavior and then empowers the primary caregiver and other systems to intervene to promote pro- social activity, family connections, and other positive outcomes. FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: MST served a total of 81 youth who are under the supervision of the Alameda County Juvenile Probation Department, including 15 youth who were carried over from the previous fiscal year, 66 youth who were accepted for services, and 47 youth who were discharged from services during this time period. Of the 47 youth discharged, 68% met the criteria for completion of MST services, signifying clear evidence of the following: primary caregiver has improved parenting skills necessary for handling subsequent problems, improved family relationships specific to the instrumental and affective domains in that family's subsystems that were drivers of the youth referral, family has improved network of informal social supports in the community and has demonstrated skill at successfully accessing a range of supports (formal and informal) as needed, youth is showing evidence of success in an educational or vocational setting, youth is involved with prosocial peers and activities and is minimally involved with problem peers, and changes in behavior of youth and in the systems contributing to the referral problems have been sustained 3- 4 weeks. A targeted area of growth for MST has been to address the rates in which youth were placed in a restrictive setting for 3 weeks or longer - a duration of time that precluded further MST involvement. This included youth who were detained at juvenile hall or residential placement. During FY 13/14, 11% of youth who discharged from MST closed due to being placed in a restrictive setting, an improvement of 16% from the previous fiscal year. Some contributing factors to this improvement include utilizing MST quarterly trainings to enhance staff's ability to develop and implement interventions that successfully address substance abuse, CBT interventions with caregivers, and developing interventions to address negative peer systems. FY 14/15 Progress Report: MST aims serve 90 -105 youth who are under the supervision of the Alameda County Juvenile Probation Department during FY 14/15. In this current fiscal year, MST has served a total of 84 youth who are under the supervision of the Alameda County Juvenile Probation Department. This includes 33 youth who were carried over from the previous fiscal year, 49 youth who were accepted for services, and 59 youth who were discharged from services during this current fiscal year. Of the 59 youth discharged, 56% met the criteria for completion of MST services, signifying clear evidence of the following: primary caregiver has improved parenting skills necessary for handling subsequent problems, improved family relationships specific to the instrumental and affective domains in that family's subsystems that were drivers of the youth referral, family has improved network of informal social supports in the community and has demonstrated skill at successfully accessing a range of supports (formal and informal) as needed, youth is showing evidence of success in an educational or vocational setting, youth is involved with prosocial peers and activities and is minimally involved with problem peers, and changes in behavior of youth and in the systems contributing to the referral problems have been sustained 3- 4 weeks. A continued target area of growth for MST is to address the rates in which youth were placed in a restrict ive setting for 3 weeks or longer - a duration of time that precluded further MST involvement. This included youth who were detained at juvenile hall or residential placement. In this current FY, 15% of youth who discharged from MST closed due to being placed in a restrictive setting, which was an increase of 4% from the previous fiscal year. MST continues to focus on reducing rates in which youth are placed in a restrictive setting for 3 weeks or longer by continuing to utilize quarterly Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 38 Rev. March 2015trainings to en hance staff's ability to develop and implement interventions that successfully address youth's referral behaviors. During this fiscal year, MST quarterly trainings have included addressing runaway behavior through intervention development and collaboration with families and probation, and interventions aimed at reducing involvement with negative peer systems. FY 15/16, 16/17 Plans: MST aims to serve 90 -105 youth who are under the supervision of the Alameda County Juvenile Probation Department during FY 15/16 and during FY 16/17. MST will continue to focus on improving treatment outcomes for youth served, with particular emphasis on increasing treatment completion rates and decreasing rates in which youth were placed in a restrictive setting for 3 weeks or longer. MST will also continue to strengthen collaboration with Probation. This information will ensure that community members, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, and the State have an accurate picture of the positive impact of the program. OES D 11. Crisis Stabilization Services - Willow Rock Program Description: This strategy will provide crisis stabilization and acute care to youth ages 12- 17 and their families, moving them towards a reduced level of care. FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: 1,533 youth were served in the Willow Rock Crisis Stabilization Unit (CSU) with a total of approximately 1,287 unique episodes of crisis assessment and stabilization services provided. Of these youth, 88% were brought to the CSU on an involuntary hold, while 12% were walk -up clients. Based on the multidisciplinary, comprehensive assessment of the youth's needs, 49% of youth assessed at the CSU were diverted from hospitalization. Survey s of youth served in the CSU show that 92% strongly agreed that they felt welcome and safe during their time in the program. One youth stated \"I loved how throughout this entire process I never felt ashamed, the staff really listened and made me feel loved, I also appreciated how it seemed like they wanted the best for me\". Willow Rock continues to provide an integrated module of the crisis stabilization training for Alameda County police officers, covering the topic of youth mental health issues and providing tours of the facility. In addition, Willow Rock and its staff support community awareness by providing tours for school district personnel, hospital staff, and other community agencies, and engaging in collaborative efforts such as the Chief Mental Health Advisory Board for the Oakland Police Department. FY 14/15 Progress Report: While we cannot predict the clients to be served in the future due to the nature of the crisis work at the CSU, it is predicted that we will continue to see slight growth eac h year in the number of youth served by the program. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the program as well as the acuity and needs of the youth served in order to adjust to an ever changing population as indicated. OESD 13. Co -Occurring Disorders Program Program Description: Provides housing, medication assessment, evaluation, education, support and monitoring to individuals with co- occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders in alcohol and drug treatment settings throughout the county. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 39 Rev. March 2015FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Trained 356 clinicians from a broad spectrum of Mental Health and SUD programs through 16 multi -agency skill -building trainings, 26 on- site trainings and TA sessions. This included conducting 1 CME training for physicians, training peer facilitators in the PEERS Tobacco Program, and training and TA to implement the 2011 BHCS Tobacco Policies and Consumer Treatment Protocols in both multi -agency training settings and at specific provider sites. Impact includes increase d clinical capacity to intervene with consumers who smoke in settings where clinicians are practicing their clinical skills and where tobacco policies have been, or are being implemented. Project activity also includes providing intensive TA to 5 BHCS tobacco intervention mini- grants designed to improve recipient agencies' competency in intervening with their clients who smoke. Mini -grantees collectively provided interventions to 286 clients in their programs, and continued to strengthen their tobacco poli cies. Collaborative work with PEERS resulted in PEERS providing 21 tobacco education presentations to over 215 consumers in 15 provider programs. Additionally, 172 consumers who were considering quitting smoking attended Tobacco Recovery Groups at 4 provid er sites. ATOD Project provides evaluation analysis to the PEERS Tobacco Program. Provider implementation of 2011 BHCS Tobacco Policies and Consumer Treatment Protocols has been uneven, with significant successes on one end of spectrum, and little or no movement on the other. Most programs are somewhere in the middle in terms of implementation and tobacco treatment. Continued outreach to those under -performing agencies produced some improvement, but disparities still exist. FY 14/15 Progress Report: Conducted 5 skill -building and 14 on -site trainings for a total of 128 participants. This includes training consumer facilitators working in PEERS Tobacco Program. Trainings are scheduled through the end of FY. Broad range impact is similar to FY13- 14. Continuing to provide support to BHCS tobacco intervention mini -grantees. As of 1/31/15, ninety -five (95) clients received tobacco interventions in these programs. IMPACT: Clients of staff we have trained are reporting decreased stigma (\"Now I can be around my children and family\"); increased MH/SUD recovery (Clients speak about how quitting smoking has strengthened their recovery from substances and mental health); improved finances (clients have been able to save for housing, furniture, flat screen TVs and more) and m ore housing opportunities (Section 8 waiting list includes \"no smoking\" for majority of available housing.) Disparity in implementation of Tobacco policies as mentioned in FY13- 14 still exist. Recently met with the BHCS Director to request additional support and assistance from BHCS to overcome these barriers. Mitigation strategies are now in process. OESD 17. Residential Treatment for Co -Occurring Disorders Program Description: Provides housing, medication assessment, evaluation, education, support and monitoring to individuals with co- occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders in alcohol and drug treatment settings throughout the county.

On average approximately seven intakes a month are conducted at Chrysalis and approximately 86 clients every year are being served of which approximately 83% are homeless. Chrysalis operates on the principal of social rehabilitation utilizing co- occurring substance abuse and mental health treatment best practices. Treatment is client centered and strengths based thus placing major emphasis on the involvement of the clients in the determination of their own treatment and rehabilitation plans. Cognitive Behavioral, Motivational Interviewing, Seeking Safety and other programs form the foundation of our behavioral interventions. Staff support and witness clients self -administer their medications, learn how to monitor, dispense and be aware when they need refills or a Doctor's consult. The goal is to assist the client to be as medically -literate as possible, gain or enhance her capability to be responsible for her own medications, and engage in constructive dialogue about medications with her own physician, pharmacist or other medical personnel. Onsite AA and NA meetings are offered. Family education/support groups are conducted and a active Resident Council is developed in order to be the voice of the community.

SCHP is a safety net service for difficult to serve and treatment adverse homeless adults who often utilize crisis services and emergency services only. SCHP participants often present with multiple barriers to permanent housing including lack of income, lack of documented disability, lack of established primary care and mistrust of the institutions that must be accessed in order to secure such benefits and care. This has resulted in a longer length of stay.

Individual Placement Support / Supported Employment (Alameda County IPS) Program Description: Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services, in conjunction with the California Department of Rehabilitation, has embarked on a long -term plan to implement Individual Placement and Supported Employment (IPS). This evidence- based practice assists adult and transition- age youth consumers with finding and maintaining competitive jobs in the commu nity available to people with and without disabilities. Engagement, job development, placement, and job follow -along supports are the core program elements of this approach. The following key features illustrate some of the essential aspects of Alameda County IPS: 1. No consumer is excluded from program access or participation due to diagnosis, presence of symptoms, substance abuse, housing status, personal presentation, etc. Desire to get a competitive job is the criterion for services, because motivation to work is a strong predictor of success. 2. Upon entry into IPS services, consumers receive direct assistance with making employer contact quickly, usually within 30 days. There are no requirements for vocational testing, work samples, employment groups or other pre- vocational activities. 3. Employment specialists make frequent, in- person employer contact and build employer relationships based on the consumer's preferences in order to make a good job match. 4. Vocational services are individualized to fit the needs and preferences of each consumer. Individualized job search and job follow -along plans reflect each person's unique interests, goals and needs. 5. Competitive jobs are the goal, and transitional and/or sheltered employment is not utilized in Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 43 Rev. March 2015order to avo id delaying progress to achieve competitive employment. 6. Once a consumer obtains a job, the follow -along services are provided continuously until the job is stable or people no longer request services. Employment specialists provide a wide- range of job coaching and job supports to support a person's success. 7. Vocational services are integrated closely with mental health services in order to ensure IPS program success. Employment specialists meet weekly with mental health teams (case managers, personal service coordinators, peer specialists, and/or psychiatrists) to share information, collaborate, and plan services. 8. Ongoing quality improvement efforts focus on building on program and staff strengths to ensure that over time program outcomes for jobs is enhanced. The Supported Employment Fidelity Scale is utilized for quality improvement guidance. These services are available to people with serious mental illness that are part of ACBHCS adult service teams, Full -Service Partnerships, Level 1 specialty providers, and Level 1 Transitional Age Youth (TAY) Programs. FY 12/13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Outcomes : Competitive employment rate percentage, which is the number of clients in the IPS program who worked a competitive job in the community, divided by the total number of people in the IPS program. Benchmarks set by the Dartmouth IPS Collaborative include 30% minimal standard, 40% good standard, and 50% exemplary standard. Data source: Quarterly data forms submitted by Alameda County IPS to the Dartmouth IPS Learning Collaborative; Vocational Services database Notable Community Impact : During this year, Alameda County IPS served 285 consumers, 104 of whom worked competitive jobs, which equals a competitive employment rate of 36%. We secured 88 competitive j ob placements for people, including positions in the administrative, retail, food service, warehouse, transportation, and education sectors. MHSA funds have been leveraged to build capacity and infrastructure for IPS services in adult and transition age youth systems of care. We provided ongoing, intensive consultation and technical assistance to Fred Finch Youth Center STAY program and Bay Area Community Services Case Management team to begin providing IPS services this year. FY 13/14 Progress Report: Outcomes : We served 255 consumers, 100 of whom worked competitive jobs, which equals a competitive employment rate of 39%. Comments on current implementation : One additional employment specialist position was created and filled. Five county clinics have increased their vocational and mental health services integration, which has increased referrals and outcomes from those programs. MHSA funds have been leveraged to build capacity and infrastructure for IPS services in adult and t ransition age youth systems of care. We provided ongoing, intensive consultation and technical assistance to one additional agency to begin providing IPS services this year. The IPS Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 44 Rev. March 2015programs at Fred Finch and BACS had an average competitive employment rate of 35% this year. Individualized benefits counseling has been more widely available for consumers considering work or who have job changes. July 2014 -June 2015 Plans: Alameda County IPS plans to directly assist 260 adult and TAY consumers with obtaining and maintaining competitive jobs that fit their preferences. Planned changes: We plan to increase the integration of vocational staff onto County -run case management teams through shared office space, attendance at weekly team meetings, and increased communication between staff. This area of IPS fidelity has been shown to increase outcomes and improve services. We plan to meet with all contracted mental health programs in Alameda County to assess their readiness to implement IPS and create a project plan. We will start a new IPS pilot at BOSS (Building Opportunities for Self -Suffici ency). We want to streamline and integrate our vocational data collection and reporting. Continue consensus building and marketing activities related to IPS. In October 2014, we plan to host a one- day IPS symposium to highlight success so far and encourage interested agencies to consider implementation.

Wellness Centers Program Description: The Wellness Centers are designed as an exit strategy for participants who are on intensive case management teams and full se rvice partnerships in Alameda County as they develop their wellness and recovery plans and link with natural and community supports. The main program goals are focused on helping individuals cr eate a fuller life in the community without the need of more intensive mental health services. Each individual is supported in developing their own recovery goals for wellness and community living. The monthly team meetings focus on the participant's successes in achieving progress in the 8 domains of wellness in their life. This is reviewed in these meetings together with a Case Manager, a Peer Counselor, an Employment Coordinator, a Psychiatrist and any one in the participant's community who can help them to achieve their goals that are developed ou t of the team meeting format. The main interventions are the following: 1. Team meetings, which occur monthly as needed to develop action steps based on needs to help individuals transition from center based supports to community based supports; 2. Classes and Workshops based on the domains of welln ess to assist individ uals in learning the skills necessary to transiti on to community services 3. Employment Services with the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model to assist individuals in attaining gainful employ ment in the jobs of their choice 4. Psychiatric support from a wellness and recovery ori ented psychiatrist to assist the individual's to transition to community based care 5. Support individuals to attain and achieve independe nt living in permanent hous ing places of their choosing. FY 14/15 Progress Report: The Centers have been used as a graduation/step down for consumer s from the Service Teams, FSPs, ACT and CHOICES program: Once someone is stepped down from one of those programs they are a llowed 3 months of utilization of both their referring serv ice provider and t he Wellness Center. After a certain amount of recovery skills are in place, the participant is discharged from the Wellness and Recovery Center and into the co mmunity where they will receive their behavioral health needs through an FQHC primary care clin ic and thus have \"graduated\" from the County mental health syst em of care. As of January 2015 the Centers will open to a wider group of participants. The Wellness and Recovery Centers will be available for usage by any behavior health participant at any Level of Care (Level l, 2, & 3.) Consumers may attend the Centers while they are on a Service Team, an FSP, an ACT or Level II case management program, or any other level of behavioral health care. Consumers may keep their psychiatrist either on their Levell teams or primary care while attending the Centers at the same time. There will be no time restrictions in participating in the Centers Consumers may partake of the services when t hey choose and for as long as they would like to participate. Referrals can come directly from another leve l care or the Centers can accept walk-ins. The Centers will continue to operate a full complement of wellness and recovery skill building Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 47 Rev. March 2015A. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SU PPORTS PROGRAM SUMMARIES tools through groups and one-on- one counseling and other Evi denced Based Practices. The Centers will increase their level of st affing with those who have lived experience, understanding the Wellness and Reco very Centers need a large staf f presence from those who have had mental health st ruggles themselves. The Centers will keep a 90-person case management program open to assist participants who are severely and persistently mentally ill and are in need of short term targeted case management services to help stabilize their life. The Centers will employee both a psychiatrist and nursing staff who will offer medication support services. Consumers can receive psychiatry services ei ther through the Wellness and Recovery Center case management program or thr ough a medication only service, The Centers will be increasing their hours to prov ide some limited service on Saturdays and/or Sundays. After January 1st 2015 a quarterly utilization revi ew meeting to determine who is attending the Centers from case management programs and whether both services are needed or the consumer can receive their services solely from the Wellness Centers will begin. BACS will engage the provider in the review and make an assessment for the consumer that they are jointly serving in order that a dialogue and/ or disposition plan can occur. FY 15/16 Plans: The overarching goal of redesigning the service utilization is to increase participation in the Centers by opening the Centers to a broader group of consumers. The Wellness and Recovery Centers under the new model will act as a touchstone for Alameda County Behavioral Health consumers and for those unknown to the behav ior health system of care. The new model will serve as a community that is driven and determined by the participants needs, and serve as a community where our consumers are welcomed to attend and partake in recovery skill building regardless of where they are at with their own recovery. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 48 Rev. March 2015 Alameda County has implemented a variety of Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) programs for the purpose of \"preventing mental illness from becoming severe and disabling and improving timely access for underserved populations.\" 1 It's the intention of all PEI programs to emphasize strategies for the goal of reducing negative outcomes that may result from untreated mental illness: suicide, incarcerations, school failure or dropout, une mployment, prolonged suffering, homelessness, and removal of childr en from their homes. California's historic commitment to prevention and early intervention through Prop 63 moves the mental health system towards a \"help- first\" instead of a \"fail first\" strategy. PEI identifies individuals at risk of or indicating early signs of mental illness or emotional disturbance and links them to treatment and other resources. 2 Alameda County's PEI programs create partnerships with schools, justice systems, primary care and a wide range of social services and community groups . In addition to these partnerships, the county has also placed these preventative and early intervention services in convenient places where people go for other routine activities. The MHSA specifies that all funded PEI Programs must include: Outreach to fam ilies, employers, primary care health care providers, and others to recognize the early signs of potentially severe and disabling mental illness ; Access and linkage to medically necessary care...as early in the onset of these conditions as practicable ; Reduction in stigma and discrimination associated with either being diagnosed with a mental illness or seeking mental health services and reduction in discrimination against people with mental illness (MHSA, Section 4, Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) \u00a7 5840(b)). 1 Proposition 63: Mental Health Services Act 2004 2 MHSOAC PEI Fact Sheet, December 2012 Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 49 Rev. March 2015MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION PROGRAMS PEI 1.A School -based Mental Health Consultation in Preschool Currently the funds for this program are being used as part of the match funding for a SAMHSA grant to develop a system of care for the 0- 5 community. This program is called Early Connections , an Initiative to strengthen services and supports for children 0- 5 and their families. For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Family Partner Integration Strategy Outcome Statements : Increased family engagement through the utilization of Family Partners Increased family knowledge regarding community resources Improved child social/emotional functioning Increased family leadership skills Impact: 110 young children and their families were served by Family Partners in FY 12/13 Family Partners provided services in English, Spanish, Chinese and Vietnamese. In FY 12- 13 Early Connections developed and implemented training and infrastructure for Family Partners in the early childhood mental health agencies. Training was provided to both Family Partners and the mental health staff at each of the agencies. Family Partners are parents with lived experience, having used services and supports for Parent Caf\u00e9 Peer to Peer Support Group Strategy Outcome Statements : Increased confidence in parenting skills Increased access to community resources Increased family leadership skills Impact: In FY 13- 14 (2) Parent Caf\u00e9 6 week sessions were held. Each session was conducted in three languages - English, Spanish and Chinese. Parent Caf\u00e9 served 50 parents in Parent Caf\u00e9 sessions. Parent Caf\u00e9 is informed by the Strengthening Families framework that integrates five strengt h-based protective factors that are essential for prevention and early intervention. The factors are: Parental Resilience, Social Connections, Knowledge of Parenting and Child Development Concrete Support in Times of Need Social and Emotional Early Connections is currently developing sustainability plans for FY 15- 16 and 16- 17. So the below numbers are estimates based on current data and initial fiscal planning. Family Partner Integration Strategy FY 14 -15: 130 young Peer Support FY FY 14 -15: 30 families FY 15 -16: 30 families FY 16/17: 30 families Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 50 Rev. March 2015their own children. Challenges : Hiring challenges at each of the early childhood mental health agencies. Each agency needed to develop job specifications and dedicate time to outreach and engage qualified individuals. Understanding of role of Family Partner. Isolation for Family Partners as sole practitioner on team of mental health staff. Strategies to mitigate: Hiring: Technical assi stance to and increased partnership with early childhood agency directors. Role and Isolation: Increased training and technical assistance for mental health staff. Ongoing monthly Family Partner/early childhood mental health agencies Learning Community. Competence of Children (www.strengtheningfamilies.net ) Family Partner Integration Strategy In FY 2013- 2014 Early Connections increased the number of Family Partners employed in early childhood mental health agencies from 7 to 12 Family Partners. Impact: It is projected that 100- 110 young children and their families will be served by Family Partners in FY 13- 14. Early Connections will continue to develop and sustain Family Partner services in early childhood mental health programs over the next three years. Early Connections is developing a Family Partner Integration Tool Kit that will provide the community with written protocol and training to develop and sustain Family Partners. Early Connections will continue to develop and sustain Co-Learning projects and training. Similar to Family Partner Integration Tool Kit, Early Connections is developing a Co-Learning Readiness and Fidelity Protocol for community use and implementation of Co -Learning. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 51 Rev. March 2015PEI 1. B/C School -based Mental Health Consultation Programs Program Description: School -Based Mental Health (SBMH) consultation currently serves 16 out of the 18 Alameda County school districts, and provides a variety of consultation services including: Child Specific Consultation; General Consultation; Trainings/Workshops; Transition Planning; Service Coordination, and Supports. SBMH Consultation Services must: involve building the capacity of schools to address the social, emotional, and behavioral learning needs of students; promote a school climate that identifies and addresses student mental health needs and is supportive of students at risk for serious mental health issues; develop collaborative partnerships with teachers, staff, parents, and other providers to create school environments that promote healthy, social emotional development; help make social -emotional learning supports available to all students; and facilitate effective problem -solving among adults and students. For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Our overall vision is that all youth are socially and emotionally healthy and graduate college and career ready. Outcome Statements : Youth and families have an increased access and utilization of mental health consultation services. Youth report improved social emotional functioning as a result of ment al health consultation services Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: This program produced: 7,607 consultation services for a total of 26,648 contacts, which is a 9% increase from FY 11/12. These numbers above are indicative that the education community, including families, are interested in and see the need for these consultation services- which increases access for those who utilize the services. For FY 13/14 the County, in partnership with the Alameda County School Districts, has developed an evaluation framework and has started a data collection process to determine a number of identified results including: 1) children are physically, socially and emotionally healthy; 2) children succeed academically; 3) environments are safe supportive and stable; 4) families a re supported and supportive and 5) Systems are integrated and care is coordinated and equitable. As data is gathered analyzed more information will be shared. No planned changes Projected people served: FY 14/15: 8,000 children, youth and families FY 15/16: 8,500 children, youth and families FY 16/17: 9,000 children youth and families Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 52 Rev. March 2015 Another example of impact was the implementation of a 6 week parenting education class for Spanish speaking parents whose children attend school in San Lorenzo Unified. Parent participation was incredibly high and parents reported learning a great deal about community resources and parenting skills that they otherwise wouldn't have learned or understood. Challenges: There were minor challenges for this year including: more need and requests for services than staff could address, uneven support from the school district around mental health consultation, and the turnover in staff which led to the need to re-educate on the concept and benefits of mental health consultation services. PEI 2. Early I ntervention for the Onset of First Psychosis & SMI among TAY Program Description: The PREP (Prevention and Recovery in Early Psychosis) Program was originally funded by a BHCS contract in early 2010 to identify and intervene with transition age youth (16-24 years) experiencing an initial episode of psychosis associated with schizophrenia and their families. The PREP Program provides the best in evidence- based treatment and support for youth and families through an intensive outpatient model of care that includes the provision of: algorithm - based medication management, cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp), individual placement and support (IPS), assertive outreach, multi -family groups, cognitive remediation and strength -based care management services. For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 53 Rev. March 2015Outcome Statement s: The PREP Program will reduce consumer hospitalizations The PREP Program will reduce the number of prescribed antipsychotics Impact : Hospitalization : During FY12 - 13, PREP collected hospital admission data from INSYST and compared the number of admissions for each active client prior to enrolling in PREP and the number of admissions each client had during their time in PREP. The total number of hospital admissions decreased by 76%; from 133 hospital admissions in the year prior to admission to just 32 during the course of enrollment . Antipsychotics : During FY1 2- 13, Examining the prescription records kept by the medical team we identified that they were able to significantly reduce the number of antipsychotic medications taken by consumers. The number of consumers not taking any antipsychotic medication increased by 6% and the average number of antipsychotic medications taken by consumers decreased by almost 66%. Challenge s: During FY12- 13 the length of stay at hospitals was not measured, so though we saw fewer hospital admissions, several of these resulted in long hospital stays For FY 13 -14 the PREP program is collecting hospital admission and length of stay for all consumers to better report how PREP reduces the burden on the psychiatric crisis system of care in Alameda County. A WR AP group for consumers and families will provide additional wellness and recovery tools to promote wellness and help identify as well as address potential crisis situations before hospitalization is necessary while leading to shorter stabilization time when hospitalization is unavoidable . PREP has made changes to the data collection practices to gather more detailed information for both hospitalization and medicat ion management. In addition, they are also collecting IPS data for education and employment. Through these improved data collection efforts PREP hopes to better report on these v ery important areas and provide a more detailed picture of the outcomes for PREP graduates. Although there have been some periods of staff turnover, PREP has been full y staffed for much of this fiscal year and plan to serve 60 active TAY consumers during FY 13/14. PREP will continue to provide services to transition age youth living in Alameda County focused on intervening early with evidence- based practices, culturally competent assessment and thorough assessed diagnosis . Projected people served: FY 14/15: 75 TAY, FY 85 TAY Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 54 Rev. March 2015Similarly with medication, in FY 12-13 medication dosage was not analyzed. The new medication management system for FY13- 14 captures dosage, lab work and several health indicators which will provide a clearer picture of the balance bet ween the effective dose and any side -effects The PREP Program is currently serving 58 consumers and PREP has served 66 consumers over the current fiscal year. The program capacity is 60 and it is contracted to provide service to 55 -60 consumers at any given time. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 55 Rev.

GART expanded its geographic boundaries beyond \"Central County\" to address community needs county -wide. GART had over 40 outreach activities throughout the County including attending \"Health Fairs\" and other community events. Challenges : Loss of staff has created some challenges for staff to provide services throughout the County All GART services are provided in the field. GART clinicians are required to \"reserve\" a County Car when transporting staff. This takes away from client contact; recommending \"purchasing\" GART car to promote improved effi ciency. Over 80% of clients' will be satisfied with GART services.

March 2015PEI 4. Stigma and Discrimination Reduction Campaign Program Description: The Alameda County Social Inclusion Campaign's goal is to create welcoming communities by promoting inclusion and eliminating mental health stigma and discrimination. The campaign is run by the consumer led organization Peers Envisioning and Engaging in Recovery Services (PEERS). For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15 -16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements: Reduce stigma and discrimination through the direct contact method. Community Impact Research suggests that having contact with people who openly talk about their mental health condition and recovery is the best way to end stigma. To help empower more consumers of mental health to talk about their experiences and provide this contact, PEER S trained a 30 member speaker's bureau, which provided trainings and speeches to 3,089 people in the general public of Alameda County. In addition to the general public special efforts were made to reach members of targeted groups. Unique messages and s peakers were utilized to help reduce stigma in these targeted groups: 675 family members , 393 people who hold the power to change housing policies and practices , and 1,491 individuals from the African American community . PEERS also produced and aired 4 Mental Health Matters educational videos for the goal of reducing stigma and increasing awareness of mental health issues. In FY 13/14 the program focused on building capacity within the special populations they have been working with so that they can cont inue to address stigma and discrimination within their own community independently . The expansion of Wellness Recovery Action Planning (WRAP) is one example of this capacity expansion. WRAP is a tool that helps consumers of mental health services overcome internal stigma and creates non-stigmatizing supportive environments within a community. To help create sustainable stigma reduction and community and individual empowerment, PEERS trained 12 African American community leaders and 12 people in the Housing Industry as certified WRAP facilitators. These individuals will then be equipped to continuously offer WRAP as a resource and continue the fight against stigma and discrimination within their communities, independent of PEERS. No Planned Changes Projec ted people served: FY efforts FY countywide through various efforts Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 60 Rev. March 2015UNDERSERVED ETHNIC LANGUAGE POPULATION (UELP) PROGRAMS The UELP programs were designed to provide services to historically underserved populations, which the State defined as: Afghan/South Asian, Asian/Pacific Islander (API), Native American, and Latino. Each UELP program is built on a foundation of three core strategies: 1) Education and Outreach, 2) Mental Health Consultation and 3) Early Intervention services. These strategies are implemented through a variety of services such as one- to-one outreach events, psycho- educational workshops/classes, consultation sessions, support groups, traditional healing workshops, radio/television/ blogging activities, and short term -low intensity early intervention counseling sessions for individuals and families who are experiencing early signs and symptoms of a mental health challenge or mental illness . In FY 12/13 the data show that these UELP providers in total produced: 4,943 prevention events, which is a 14% increase; 33,101 people were served at these prevention events; (duplicated count) and 751 unique clients were served through early intervention services, which is 28% more than the previous year of 585 clients. Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services is currently working with all of the UELP programs to finalize a simple outcome- based survey that will be fully implemented in FY 14/15 in 11 languages: English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Khmer, Nepali, Korean, Thai, and Burmese. Domains that the survey will cover include: C onnecting individuals and families with their culture; F orming and strengthening identity; C hanging knowledge and perception of mental health; B uilding community and wellness, and Improving access to services and resources. In addition to identifying progress and success through the above survey domains the county has also started to analyze early intervention data to determine if access has increased for these historically underserved populations. A preliminary round of data analysis does seem to indicate that access to mental health services has increased. BHCS looked at \"access\" in two ways: 1) Of the people receiving early intervention services, what percent had received services in our system with in the past three years and 2) O f the people receiving early intervention services what percent went on to need mental health treatment services. For our first question BHCS took a cohort of 598 early intervention clients from FY 12/13 and looked back three years to see if this cohort had ever been served in our system before. The data found that only 15% of t hese 598 clients had ever been seen before in our system. Reasons for not accessing services in the past are still being investigated; however the data does show an increase in access for a significant number of clients in this cohort. For the second question BHCS took a cohort of 619 early intervention clients from FY 11/12 and looked forward to see what percent went on to need mental health treatment services. The data found that 31% of the 619 clients went on to receive mental health treatment services (mainly outpatient services) in FY 12/13. This data indicates that the majority of early intervention clients who are experiencing early signs and symptoms of a mental health challenge or mental illness are being Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 61 Rev. March 2015able to receive the appropriate level of care from a cultural lens that they are familiar with; and that for those needing a higher level of care they're being referred for this care. More information will be shared on this indicator of access as data is available and analyzed. PEI 5. Outreach, Education and Consultation for the Latino Communities Program Description : The UELP program that serves the Latino community is led by the agency la Clinica de La Raza and is called \"Cultura y Bienestar\". It's designed to serve Latinos throughout Alameda County by providing services through a four agency collaborative with each agency leveraging its knowledge and trust in their region to provide services to Latinos in their region of Alameda County. La Cl\u00ednica de La Raza serves the northern region, La Familia Counseling Service serves the central region, Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center serves the southern county region and East Bay Youth and Family Initiatives serves the east county region. More information on this program can be found at http://culturaybienestar.com For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15-16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements Youth and families have an increased access and utilization of culturally specific prevention and early intervention services Participants will report increases in social emotional wellness and cultural connections . Participants will report an increased understanding on where to seek support/help in crisis situations. Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: This program produced: 2, 137 prevention events (200% increase); 14,623 people were served at these prevention events; (duplicated count) and 399 unique clients were served through early intervention services, which is a 35% Community PEI Educators continue to help reduce stigma by interchanging the terminolog y of mental health with emotional well -being, allowing for a more receptive message to be communicated. The emphasis is on promoting a state of well -being, recognizing disequilibrium, and providing tools and resources for establishing emotional well - being, physical health, and supportive, healthy relationships in one's life. This program has also helped to normalize mental health issues by pointing out its prevalence and the availability and efficacy of treatment. Individuals are having a better under standing of what constitutes mental health and how to recognize the signs associated with mental health conditions. No planned changes Projected people served: FY 14/15: 2,250 1,463 children and TAY, older adult s FY 15/16: 2,275 1,489 children and TAY 786 adults & older adults FY 16/17: 2,300 1495 children & TAY 805 adults & older adults Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 62 Rev. March 2015increase from FY 11/12. These numbers are indicative of the Latino community recognizing the value of this program as consultants for prevention services, CBO trainings, traditional healing, and community development. Another example of impact is through utilization of media in the form of a monthly radio show on Radio 1010 to discuss mental health topics allowing a question and answer segment that allows callers to receive an immediate consultation and referral for mental health services if needed. This type of format allowed for the discussion of cultural norms and traditions that lay at the foundation for the expression of grief, depression, anxiety, loss, immigration, unemployment, and trauma in the Latino community. Challenges: One challenge the prog ram has faced involves access for children and youth during the school year. This challenge was mitigated by providing services during recesses or after school times. In Hayward, the program worked closely with the Hayward Unified School District which provided program staff with access to students during normal school hours. Access to youth is also facilitated by their close relationships with the Union City, Newark, Oaklan d, and Fremont School Districts. The program has also Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 63 Rev. March 2015encountered challenges reaching LGBTQQ I youth. To remedy this, they conducted outreach at local LGBTQQI events and successfully established ongoing relationships with members of these groups. PEI 6. Outreach, Education and Consultation for the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) Communities Program Description: The UELP program that serves the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) Communities is led by two agencies, Asian Community Mental Health (ACMHS) and Community Health for Asian Americans (CHAA) and is called \"API Connections\". It's designed to serve a diverse range of unserved and underserved API communities through the provision of culturally responsive mental health promotion/prevention and early intervention services. More information on API Connections can be found at http://www.chaaweb.org/programs/apiconnections and http://acmhs.org For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15-16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements Youth and families have an increased access and utilization of culturally specific prevention and early intervention services Participants will report increases in social emotional wellness and cultural connections. Participants will report an increased understanding on where to seek support/help in crisis situations. Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: This program produced: 1,936 prevention events ( 25% Community PEI Wellness Educators continue to help reduce stigma by interchanging the terminology of mental health with personal joy and well-being, allowing for a more receptive message to be communicated. Currently API Connections is engaged in a number of activities including: Network ing with Alameda County's Pool of Consumer Champions Asian subcommittee to encourage more community members with lived experience of recovery to become trained as mentors and speakers Start ed a new support group No planned changes Projected people served: FY 14/15: 2,250 1,463 children and adults FY 15/16: 2,275 1,489 children and TAY 786 adults & older adults FY 16/17: 2,300 1,495 children & TAY 805 adults & older adults Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 64 Rev. March 2015increase ); 9,410 people were served at these prevention events; (duplicated count) and 183 unique clients were served through early intervention services, which is a 32% increase from FY 11/12. Within the many API communities there is an incredibly high degree of stigma regarding mental health. These numbers above are indicative of services that are culturally responsive and as such people have been interested and open to attend ing events and utilizing these PEI services. Among the many API communities a number of approaches have assisted in opening dialog about mental health and reducing stigma. Some of these approaches include: taking an ethnic group' s world view approach and embedding it into conversations; speaking in their native language; organizing support groups that include non- threatening activities and engaging people in their daily routi nes, out in the community (not at clinic sites) to make discussions about mental health and resources less threatening. Community friendly Bi -lingual resource brochures were also developed in English, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Khmer. Challenges: Several external challenges for K orean -speaking mothers who have children or youth with mental illness Launched a Cambodian elementary school students' after school wellness program in Oakland to address and prevent the prevalence of youth gang violence among Cambodian neighborhoods In the process of d eveloping social groups for the Mongolian community focused on physical activity, single women, and parenting. Creation of a support group for Pacific Islander families of prisoners, former ly incarcerated individuals and their allies to better support this population in the community. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 65 Rev. March 2015were faced in the past year including new leadership at the executive level, implementation of electronic health records, staff unionizing and family deaths. Staff were able to overcome these challenges through re- focusing on c lients and hosting a half day retreat. Other programmatic challenges included tracking and timely submission of Medi -cal Administrative Activities. Additional time and training has been dedicated to this so that in FY 13/14 this will not be as challenging . PEI 7. Outreach, Education and Consultation for the South Asian/Afghan Communities Program Description: The UELP programs that serve the South Asian and Afghan Communities are run by two prominent community -based agencies, the Portia Bell Hume Center and the Afghan Coalition. Both of these agencies work collaboratively in providing services to these underserved populations. Examples of their activities include (but are not limited to): home visits, gender specific support groups, psycho- educational workshops and presentations, mental health consultations, healing practices that address issues of trauma, low -intensity early intervention visits and other cultural celebrations. More information on this program can be found at http://www.humecenter.org and http://www.afghancoalition.org For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements Youth and families have an increased access and utilization of culturally specific prevention and early intervention services Participants will report increases in social emotional wellness and cultural connections. Participants will report an increased understanding on The community mental health specialists continue to outreach and engage the various South Asian communities in order to reduce stigma and discrimin ation. One agency has presented at three different conferences addressing mental wellness among the South Asian community. Conferences include: Healing and Resiliency, Spirituality and No planned changes Projected people served: FY 14/15: 850 442 children and TAY, 408 adults & older adults FY 15/16: 875 455 children and TAY 420 adults & older adults FY 16/17: 900 468 children & TAY Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 66 Rev. March 2015where to seek support/help in crisis situations. Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: This program produced: 810 prevention events ( 40% increase); 8,565 people were served at these prevention events; (duplicated count) and 128 unique clients were served through early intervention services, which is a 100 % increase from FY 11/12. Within the many South Asian communities there is an incredibly high degree of stigma regarding mental health. These numbers above are indicative of services that are culturally responsive and as such , people have been interested and open to attending events and utilizing these PEI services. Among the many South Asian communities a number of approaches have helped facilitate dialog and conversations about mental health and reducing stigma. Some of these approaches include: developing \"non- psychological jargon\" for outreach and engagement, conducting activities in native languages such as Hindi, Punjabi, Dari, Farsi, Urdu, Pashto and Tamil, and providing opportunities for engagement and services out in the community, e.g. at resource fairs, local temples, a youth soccer club, schools, community centers, etc. An additional example of a successful outreach and Wellness Conference with a focus on Asian Sikh, Hindu, Buddhist, and Islamic Communities, and Women and Trauma Training. Additionally, this same team participated in a radio talk show through a South Asian Radio Show to address mental health illness and early detection. Another goal for FY 13/14 is to increase print m edia outreach to the Afghan community by having a monthly article on mental health in the Afghan Examiner. There are also goals to partner with existing agencies and schools in the southern part of Alameda County to continue to develop relationships and leverage resources for these communities. 432 adults & older adults Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 67 Rev. March 2015engagement strategy was the use of a \"wheel of questions\" at various community events. The purpose of the wheel is to engage participants to interact with a mental health specialist in a fun and nonthreatening way to address or highlight healthy coping mechanisms when dealing with stress or a challenging life event. Challenges: As with many of the UELP programs the challenge of overcoming mental health stigma and engaging communities is always present. These programs have been able to mitigate this challenge through not using labels or jargon and introducing services as a way to cope with everyday challenges and normalizing clients' experiences. There has also been staff turnover in one of the programs, which created delayed timelines in implementing a media outreach campaign and lack of continuity at one school site. However these positions have been filled and the program appears to be back on track to meet their annual deliverables. PEI 8. Outreach, Education and Consultation for the Native American Communities Program Description: The UELP program that serves the Native American Communities is led by the community organization the Native American Health Center (NAHC). This PEI program run by the NAHC is called Spirit, Art & Culture, Guidance and Encouragement (SAGE) Center. To date this program, has been very successful in providing culturally appropriate mental health promotion/prevention and early intervention services to the Native American community. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 68 Rev. March 2015For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 upc oming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements Youth and families have an increased access and utilization of culturally specific prevention and early intervention services Participants will report increases in social emotional wellness and cultural connections. Participants will report an increased understanding on where to seek support/help in crisis situations. Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: This program produced: 60 prevention events; 503 people were served at these prevention events; (duplicated count) and 41 unique clients were served through early intervention services. The SAGE Center has had a number of impactful projects during this time period including: 1) The introduction of Living By the \"Ceremonial Calendar\". Native American ceremonies are fundamental to human growth, development and connec tion to the community. The SAGE Center has conducted three initiation ceremonies during FY 12/13: Manhood Ceremony, Sun Dance Ceremony, and the Womanhood Ceremony. 2) In May 2013 the SAGE Center held their annual Sage Gathering and Wrapping for their community. This provides access for the Native The PEI Natural Helpers continue to help reduce stigma by interchanging the terminology of mental health with the idea of \"being out of balance\". This culturally relevant/responsive interpretation of the conc ept of mental health/illness allows for a more receptive message to be communicated. Staff at the SAGE Center are also involved at the State level though the California Reducing Disparities Initiative, e.g. staff and Native family members were featured in the film \"A Different State of Mind \", which was aired on PBS in July 2013. The film showed the use of \"ceremony \", as a collective approach to recover y from imbalance opposed to the individual approach common in western practices. No planned changes Projected people served: FY 14/15: 850 442 children and TAY, 408 adults & older adults FY 15/16: 875 455 children and TAY 420 adults & older adults FY 16/17: 900 468 children & TAY 432 adults & older adults Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 69 Rev.

It provides the N ative community with a way to heal from Historical Trauma an d at the same time strengthen others by giving back with the preparation and use of traditional medicine. Over 1000 sage bundles were created at this event. Challenges: As with many of the UELP programs the challenge of overcoming mental health stigma and engaging communities is always present. This program has been able to mitigate this challenge through using the term historical trauma (HT, which both empowers the community and reduces stigma as it's a term that takes into consideration the context of Native experiences in response to federal policies. Historical trauma responses (HTR) is a constellation of features including substance abuse, suicidal thoughts, low self - esteem, bursts of anger, difficulty with relationships, unresolved grief, mood regulation. All new hires to Native American Health Center learn about HT and HTR as part of their new employee orientation. The SAGE Center conducts on average 2-3 of these trainings a month for staff and the community . Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 70 Rev. March 2015PEI 9. Mental Health - Primary Care Integration Program Description: Build behavioral health capacity in primary care clinics with Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) delivering primary care in the County. The project uses the AIMS model, provides training to FQHCs and incentives to encourage those clinics to develop behavioral health positions. FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Despite staffing changes during FY 13/14, BHCS has been able to increase the level of participation by all of the Community Health Centers in the Integrated Behavioral Health Program. BHCS staff working on the integration projects with the Community Clinics are now attend the monthly Alameda Health Consortiums' Behavioral Health Clinicians meeting as well as trainings. This is a new level of collaboration between Safety Net health care providers and behavioral health staff which will benefit all Alameda County residents. FY 14/15 Progress Report: All of the Alameda Health Consortium's Community Health Centers (including Alameda Health System) are actively participating in the Integrated Behavioral Health Program that focuses on the recruitment and retention of licensed Behavioral Health Clinicians and participation in the Pay for Performance's five measures of patient treatment progress. The Consortium Health Centers are now have two more quarters left on their BHCS Integration contracts, and are working with staff to identify new performance measures that will improve patient behavioral health treatment outcomes and strengthen their ability to serve Alameda County residents with behavioral health concerns. FY 15/16 Plans: BHCS implemented the county -operated Psychiatric Consultation Service in al l 8 of Alameda County CBO Community Health Centers. All of the Community Health Centers have expressed that this new service has been of tremendous value to their primary care providers in their treatment of clients with behavioral health concerns as well as improved their ability to prescribe psychotropic medications. BHCS is currently meeting with the Alameda Health Consortium Leadership to discuss renewal of this service as well identify ways new ways to work as a team in the primary care clinic setting that improve quality of care and patient services. PEI 12. Trauma Informed Care/Suicide Prevention Program Description: Crisis Support Services of Alameda County (CSS) is a nonprofit, volunteer - based crisis intervention and suicide prevention agency. They provide a variety of mental health services to a wide range of persons in varying degrees of crisis. Their primary miss ion is to assist people in emotional distress, to offer supportive counseling to those in crisis and to prevent suicide. CSS is leading the way for suicide prevention centers across the nation in providing sensitive and timely services to people impacted by traumatic stress. Trauma -Informed C are (TIC) is a person- centered response that focuses on improving functioning over curing mental illness (or \"fixing\" something \"broken\"). It recognizes that people are more than their labels and diagnoses and those relationships are a common context for traumatic events, and that healing most often occurs in the context of relationships. CSS utilizes a wide range of TIC components and responses when working with all of their clients, but predominantly with those affected by traumatic loss, particularly sui cide and homicide bereavement.

Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: The Teens for Life (TFL) Youth Suicide Prevention program In FY 13/14 all of the suicide prevention programs and trauma informed care strategies are going strong. See the comments below from several of the programs to better understand the impact these programs are having: Student Comment from the Teens for Life Youth Suicide Prevention Program : \"I used to think that learning about suicide wouldn't be very helpful, that common sense would kick in. I now know that isn't the case and I feel prepared to help anyone who may feel depressed or suicidal\". 14 year -old Youth Comment from the Crisis Text Line: One texter chose to save the tri -fold text line card given out during a TFL presentation for a future time: \" you guys came and visited my health class in like the beginning of the year...handed out little pamphlets and I kept one in my sock drawer next to my blade. The other day, after being clean for 4 months, I went to go and cut, but saw the number, and yeah, texted and my wrists are still healed :)\" Based on the data from the crisis phone line and text line No planned changes Projected people served: FY 14/15: 13,700 12,800 children and older adults FY 15/16: 13,800 12,850 children and TAY 950 adults & older adults FY 16/17: 13,900 12,900 children & TAY 1,000 adults & older adults Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 72 Rev.

The group and individual counseling program served 72 adults for a total of 735 sessions and 262 students for a total of 2,803 sessions -all through the lens of being trauma informed and for many individuals addressing the traumatic issue within the counseling sessions. Community Education & Consul tation Trainings served 822 adults through 36 trainings. Post training 88% strongly agreed or agreed with this statement \" I feel confident in my ability to ask directly about suicide.\" Challenges: these are the areas where youth are struggling the most: Suicidal desire (feeling hopeless) Anxiety Self harm Relationship issues Bullying LGBTQ coming out struggles CSS has also developed a number of new collaborations in FY 13/14 including a partnership with the Oakland Police Department (OPD). OPD provides Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) for law enforcement and CSS was asked to participate as a trainer on Suicide Assessment & Intervention. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 73 Rev. March 2015Access to teachers and parents in school systems are still a challenge. This has been mitigated somewhat through collaboration with the PEI funded school district mental health liaisons, but remains an ongoing challenge to be addressed each school year. PEI 12. Family Education Resource Center Program Description: The Family Education and Resource Center (FERC) is a program of the Mental Health Association of Alameda County. It's a family/caregiver centered program that provides education, advocacy, support and hope to families and caregivers of a love d one with a mental health challenge. For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15,FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements : Family Leadership : Increase leadership and advocacy skills for family members through the Family Leadership Program (FLP). Public Education: Future mental health providers will increase their knowledge of consumer and family member perspectives around mental health and mental health challenges through in- class Public Education Training (PET) Program . Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: 2,168 individuals were served through the FERC during this fiscal year. In FY 13/14 the FLP has continued its efforts and has all 5 members sitting on committees or workgroups to represent the family voice and share the family perspective. It's the goal of this program to grow the number of family leaders from 5 to 10 in the upcoming fiscal year. The FERC would also like to support these family leaders in being able to tell their story on various public speaking panels so as to raise awareness of the family voice/perspective. The Public Education Training Campaign has been incredibly successful with 83% of participants strongly agreeing that they expected to use some of the information that they learned during the training.

Asian Pacific Islander staffing to ACCESS Program Description: Improve availability of ACCESS information and referral; and brief treatment service s by increasing bicultural staff in one Asian Pacific Islander crisis clinic. Services include phone referrals, assessment, outreach and brief crisis stabilization treatment. FY 13/14 Progress Report: (n=172) Adult 53.74% (n=1,193) Older Adult (60 and over) 13.92% (n=309). For Short Term Crisis Stabilization program, there was an increase of 65 years and older clients being served. They accounted for 11% of open cases during the year of 2013. Largest age group was 45- 65 years old and they accounted for about 50% of clients served. Clients who were younger than 34 years old accounted for 23%. Examples of notable impacts in the community: We reached out to general population, LGBT communities and faith communities. We provided psycho- education presentation and organized Wellness/Safety & Health events. We also collaborated with Chinese speaking NAMI group. In order to expand geographic areas for outreach, two of the outreaches were held in Fremont. We also provided psycho- education to professionals and providers to increase awareness and sensitivities to address mental health treatment needs for API population (Sausal Creek and County ACCESS staff) There are countless examples of individual cases that without Asian ACCESS, they would never be served. One of the examples is a mute, Mien speaking gentleman. Since he arrived to this country two decades ago, he had been virtually living in the backyard storage unit for most of his adult life while manifesting psychotic symptoms. With outreach and psycho- education to the family , client is now receiving mental health treatment, and be linked to other social services. We often find that once we establish a connection with a client, we start to see more family members who need mental health and social services. As we are able to provide various supportive services within the same agency, it makes coordinated care much more streamlined. Challenges and barriers: General stigma about and lack of knowledge of mental health treatment among Asians continue to be a challenge. We have been addressing this by engaging public in various settings to provide psycho- education. We note that once the clients find our assistanc e helpful, the stigma about receiving mental health services was reduced. They or their family and friends are more likely to approach us for services. For example we receive calls from former youth Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 78 Rev. March 2015client who now request services for themselves as adults . We also received calls from former clients referring their family or friends. Systemic issues: health care system changes make it very difficult for monolingual clients to access services. We will continue to address issues at county level to advocate for the APIC community. We will also help link clients to services if they have language barriers. We continue to provide integrated health care to our ACCESS clients through the SAMHSA grant. We felt more impacts of Health Care change. Many clients called in or walked in to ask about changes from HealthPAC to MediCal. They could not get through Alameda Alliance and called 1-800-491-9099 listed on their card, which was Alameda County ACCESS number, as such routed to our Asian ACCESS referral line when they pressed \"3\" for Asian languages. When moderate -severe requirements/ screening tool for specialty mental health services was introduced, we felt our clients were unfairly impacted. We were advised to screen caller over the phone, and do not proceed to fac e to face screening unless they meet moderate- severe criteria over the phone. However, most callers are not able to articulate their symptoms or treatment needs due to stigma, nor will they volunteer personal and family issues right away to some strangers on the phone. In addition, callers tend to undermine problems and are not familiar with mental illness. With screening question on whether callers have any past psychiatric treatment history, the \"no\" answer may not reflect correctly their service needs. Callers may not have received any treatment in the past due to the non- existence or non- utilization of psychiatric services in their home country. Therefore, the screening tool may present false negative outcomes, preventing them from being accurately assessed for their symptoms, thus treatment recommendations. For this reason, we believe that face to face assessment is crucial for proper assessment and determination of level of care for most immigrant Asian populations. Mild-Moderate Condition Clients. Related to previous point, the clients who were screened and determined to be functioning at mild- moderate range were referred out to PCP or their health plan mental health providers. However, monolingual Asian clients face tremendous difficulties in obtai ning mental health services. First, they have difficulty navigating the automated phone system to talk to a live person and request someone to communicate in their native language. Then they were given phone numbers of providers who do not speak their language, and/or not accepting new clients, requiring them to go through step 1 again. Third, even if they are assigned to providers, most likely they are English speaking providers working with them through translators. Many clients expressed dissatisfaction to continue services under such arrangements. Some of the clients who are lost in the system called us for help, but we need to turn them down because they do not meet the severity level for specialty mental health services. Such system creates unfair barrier to our API monolingual clients as they will most likely give up seeking further help during the process, contributing further the low penetration rate for API group. Impact of Covered California Plan. Many clients obtained Covered California health insurance plan and as such can no longer receive county's specialty mental health services. When they try to use mental health services under their insurance, however, many face similar problems as stated above. During FY 13/14, psychotic disorders -related intake calls were at 19.83% as compared to 5.12 % of County ACCESS statistics. This confirms that Asian Americans tend to under -utilize services, and when they do seek services, symptoms tend to be very severe. Continue to outreach clients in the community by doing home visits assessments and providing consultation to families. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 79 Rev. March 2015PEI 16.

Transition Age Youth (TAY) Youth Centers Program Description: The TAY Wellness program at Youth Uprising (YU) consists of a team of 2 full time mental health clinicians, a mental health intake intern and Health and Wellness Director. Under the MHSA Wellness contract, these clinicians provide individual, family and group counseling services to TAY ages 13- 24, prioritizing uninsured TAY between the ages of 16- 24. In addition to counseling services the Wellness Team supports TAY around basic needs including housing, food and shelter in order to minimize barriers to therapy engagement associated with these needs. The YU Wellness Program employs innovative approaches to build relationships and offer mental health services packaged as mentoring, arts, recreation, education and simply meeting basic needs. This approach to service delivery has resulted in a broad definition of \"client\" and \"engaged\" which allows Wellness services to be delivered to TAY who may not be ready to engage in traditional weekly therapy services. For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming F Y 14 -15, FY 15-16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements: Increase the diversity of TAY clients receiving clinical services with a particular focus on LGBTQ youth and youth of color. Reduce stigm a associated with mental illness. Improve the integration of physical and mental well - Current programmatic Strengths and Activi ties: Triple C: \"Cool Calm to \"Anger Management\". A clinician engages TAY in group activities around mood management, positive coping and mindfulness. Triple C is offered year round with high demand.

Of which, 123 cl ients (50%) identified as female, 122 as male and 1 as transgender. 73% identified ad African American , 20% Latino and 7% other. In terms of age 5% were between the ages 13- 15, 20% between 16-17, 43% between 18-21 and 24% between ages 22- 24. TAY Wellness staff worked to increase YU as a welcoming place for the LGBTQ youth consumers through: hosting a Coming Out Party; starting a Queers and Allies (Q&A) standing committee, and adopting a bathroom policy in support of Trans identified members, clients and visitors. TAY Wellness staff have also worked to reduce mental health stigma through the provision of internal trainings for YU staff to reduce discrimination and biases that may be implicitly operating around mental health challenges. Additionally the YU Wellness Team has worked to improve the integration of physical and mental well -being of TAY through the assistance of enrollment in healthcare/health insurance. Assistance included scheduling appointments, attending enrollment (WRAP ) group: In collaboration with the agency PEERS, YU began hosting and offering a WRAP group in January 2014. Six TAY have engaged in this service and are working on their individual plans to reduce personal crisis and maintain/ improve t heir level of functioning . Mental Health Intake Clinician- Intern. This is a relatively new position on the Wellness T eam. This position was added to increase efficiency with referral triage and reducing wait times between referral for service and service contact. The curr ent intern is a YU alumni, who' s currently in a psy chology doctorate program. She' s bilingual and has increased YU's capacity to engage monolingual Spanish speaking parents. Current Challenges Staff v acancy: TAY Wellness program is currently understaffed due to a clinician departure in December 2013. The vacancy has been posted. Interviews were conducted and an offer was made to a qualified candidate in February, After some delay, that candidate declined the offer of employment. They're still searching for a qualified clinician, with priority of adding Spanish language capacity to the Wellness T eam. Group referrals: Youth counseling groups rarely reach full capacity. YU is in discussion with multiple 250 prevention/ wellness classes 45 counseling services Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 82 Rev.

Challenges : One priority in FY12- 13 was to support TAY with health care enrollment to facilitate engagement in physical health care services. Despite increased on- site support from the Medi -Cal office and ability to submit HealthPAC applications, there remained challenges in completing health care applications. TAY between ages of 18- 24 posed unique challenges of address instability, difficulty proving income and household size, and challenges producing necessary documents to complete the application. potential partners to increase the number of referrals sources external to YU programming in order to implement more group programming. PEI 18. Behavioral Health Medical Home Program Description: Provide BHCS consumers with serious mental illness with access to integrated primary health care services in two Alameda County Mental Health Community Support Centers. FY 12/13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges In Fiscal Year 12/13, the PATH Project exceeded its enrollment goal of 250 program participants at the Oakland and Tri -City Fremont Adult Community Support Centers. The Fremont Tri -City PATH Clinic opened on August 8, 2012, and by March, 2013, the PATH Project had enrolled 261 program participants at the Oakland and Tri -City Community Su pport Centers. The PATH Project amended the primary care partners BHCS contracts to include onetime funds for dental care services not covered by Medi -Cal. Each PATH site received $15,000 to $20,000 in SAMHSA Grant \"Carryover\" funding to cover dental procedures beyond basic examinations and cleanings authorized by the State of California Dental -Cal Program. Wellness activities at both sites also were able to start classes on nutritional cooking, medical education, and stress reduction, and walking groups. Peer run support groups also met at the Oakland PATH site to explore how to implement the \"Community Connections Program\". At the end of the fiscal year, program participants were setting \"Healthy Living\" goals and close to 50% of the enrolled PATH c lients participated in at least one well class or activity. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 83 Rev. March 2015The Oakland PATH Project completed the first year of the State of California, External Quality Review Organization's Performance Improvement Project (EQRO). The EQRO Team visited the Oakland PATH site on November 8, 2012, and was very impressed with the progress made by the PATH Project staff on the collection of health data and with the high level of satisfaction among the program's participants. An analysis of clients enrolled for a year or more showed significant health improvements were made in lowering metabolic indicators for those with high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol (See PIP PATH Data Presentation and PATH Metabolic Indicators Attachments). On February 7 and 8, 2013, the BHCS PATH Project sponsored the Winter SAMHSA PBHCI Western Regional Conference at the Oakland Airport Hilton Hotel. The conference had over 93 attendees from PBHCI Grantee Programs from the States of Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Utah, Arizona, and California. On Friday, February 8, 2013, Ms. Kathy Reynolds, Vice President Health Integration and Wellness Promotion Services spoke to BHCS Executive Leadership, managers, and directors of primary care, behavioral health, and substance abuse organizations on \"How to implement and sustain Integrated Health Services within the Behavioral and Primary Care Health Settings\". Over 30 behavioral health program leaders and managers were able to be in attendance for the presentation. On August, 2013, the PATH Project was able to fill its Registered Nurse and Mental Health Specialist positions at the Oakland Community Support Center as well as start its fourth half day clinic on Friday morning on December 6, 2013. FY 13/14 Program Outcomes to Date and Plans: During FY2013/2014, the PATH Project entered its fourth year, and has been able to increase its participant enrollment to over 280 consumers enrolled at the Oakland and Tri -City Adult Community Support Centers with a participant retention rate over 80%. In February, 2014, the BHCS Decision Support Services and the PATH Project Program Evaluator looked at LifeLong Medical Care's health data for Level I Clients in the PATH Project and Level I Clients not enrolled in a behavioral health integrated primary care service. The results showed that PATH participants not only had more successful access to primary care services, but also over a 12 month period had higher improvement rates for their blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI) and blood sugar level. The PATH P roject's Sustainability Workgroup completed a written PATH Project Sustainability Plan in March, 2014, which was approved by Alameda County's SAMHSA, Primary Behavioral Health Care Integration Project Officer. The Sustainability Plan described the activities used by BHCS to create collaborative partnerships with the PATH Primary Care provider organizations, the necessary financial model to cover the costs of the services, and the collection of data that shows the positive impact of the services. On May 12, 2014, the PATH Project received approval from BHCS Executive Leadership to start exploring the possibility to implement a PATH Project model at the Eden Adult Community Support Center in San Leandro, California. Eden Community Support Center has approximately 325 enrolled Level I program participants. On May 22, 2014, the Oakland PATH Project sponsored its second Annual \"Visioning Retreat\" to discuss the project's progress, set new goals, and discuss how the integrated care program has had an impact on Level I consumers participating in the primary care services and health and wellness classes and activities. The retreat was attended by 35 case managers, primary care providers, psychiatrists, peer support counselors, nurses, and program evaluation staff. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 84 Rev. March 2015Starting in the last quarter of FY 13/14, the PATH Project has been collaborating with three of the BHCS Adult Community Support Center Directors to have discussion meetings with the BHCS, Substance Abuse Administrator and his program staff on how to improve access to substance abuse treatment services for SMI consumers enrolled in the community support centers and full service partnerships. FY 14/15 Program Plans: Implement the PATH Project at Eden Adult Community Support Center by February, 2015, and operate two half day primary care clinics at the site by June 30, 2015, with at 95 enrolled program participants. Using the PATH Project's integration model, implement a half time primary care service in collaboration with Ti burcio Vasquez Health Center at the BHCS Gail Steel Wellness and Recovery Center in Hayward, California by May 25, 2015. Working in collaboration with the BHCS Substance Abuse Administration staff, identify at least two ways that SMI consumers served by BHCS community support centers and full service partnerships can have improved access to substance abuse treatment and recovery services available in Alameda County. Work with the Alameda Health Consortium to develop ways to get access to the physical health information on SMI consumers ser ved by their network of community health centers so that the PATH Project can better monitor the impact of integrated care on emergency room utilization, hospitalizations (psychiatric and medical), and criminal justice contacts. FY 15/16 Program Plans: Work collaboratively with the BHCS Information System Office to make sure that the new Electronic Health Record System can be utilized by the behavioral and primary care staff that is a part of the PATH Project to share health information on program partici pants. Monitor PATH Project staff to ensure that they are billing Medi -Cal for the client services at the BHCS, adult community support centers. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 85 Rev.

The Conference included grantee workshops, a plenary speaker on innovations in mental health services, and multi- media presentations of the projects. 250 providers, County staff, school representatives, consumers, family members, and other community members participated in the conference. Challenge: The first round of INN grant funding was awarded based on a learning question posed by the grant ee, coupled with their innovative approach designed to answer that question. Though the grants were all quite worthy, Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) and the MHSA Ongoing Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 90 Rev. March 2015Planning Council (OPC) learned from this initia l process that our funding criteria were too broad. These overly -broad criteria resulted in an overwhelming number of proposals, many of which did not help us address issues facing our system of care. This was a valuable learning experience for BHCS . Round Two Innovation Grant Projects (INN 2) Innovative pilot projects were in implementation from Apr il 2012 to December 2013. For the second round of INN funding, BHCS, with input from the MHSA Ongoing Planning Council formulated the learning questions and the desired outcomes to address issues rose in the African American Utilization Report . BHCS' intention was to improve the quality of care and more positive mental health outcomes for the African American clients and consumers . Alameda County has historically served African Americans for behavioral health issues at a disproportionately higher rate than other members of our community, yet the outcomes are inconsistent. In late 2009, BHCS leadership commissioned a study to address and explore t he various issues affecting behavioral health care services in Alameda County within the African American community. The process was led by a local facilitation team, working with the BHCS Ethnic Services Manager/Cultural Competency Coordinator and a 29- member committee. Input was solicited from a full spectrum of community stakeholders and subject matter experts regarding ways to resolve these disparities and deliver more effective, culturally appropriate care. The African American Utilization Report contains the Committee's findings and recommendations and serves as the foundation for the Innovations Grants, Round Two Learning Questions. BHCS' overarching goal is to decrease African American utilization of more restrictive and often involuntary levels of care by providing and engaging African Americans in more culturally responsive services that result in improved client/consumer outcomes and reduced disparities. BHCS identified as priorities those recommendations that would have the greatest impact on our system and spanned all four systems of care. BHCS created the learning questions to address four critical needs: 1. Developing culturally responsive practices; 2. Strengthening BHCS partnership with the faith- based community; 3. Supporting trauma informed care that recognizes the trauma related to social issues within the African American community ; 4. Engaging African American males in their primary and behavioral health care. In April 2012, fifteen grantees were selected to implement the second round of Innovativ e (INN 2) Projects to address these needs . At the completion of the 18 month implementation period, INN 2 grantees would submit one of the following project outcomes: 1. An age- based, culturally -informed provider training curriculum designed to improve effect iveness of behavioral health care services to African American clients/consumers and their f amilies; 2. A program design that includes a set of specific strategies for the development of an effective partnership between the African American faith- based and spiritual communities. T hese communities will serve as cultural institutions and a natural support for BHCS clients/consumers and their families ; 3. An age- based provider training curriculum designed to increase BHCS capacity and expertise on trauma informed care for BHCS African American clients/consumers and families; 4. A set of specific strategies, supports and recommendations that will improve the engagement of African American adult males in behavioral health and primary care services.

March 2015ATTACHMENT A: PUBLIC COMMENT & RESPONSES NOTE: Only \"substantive comments\" -- defined as comments or requests for changes that would significantly alter the target population, design or budget of one or more programs - are shown and responded to. Other comments are available upon request. 1 FSP 10 - African Amer ican Full Service Partnership Public Comment Response Does \"Multi -disciplinary team\" mean that there will only be one provider for all Alameda County African American TAY and Adult Male consumers? One provider at $500,000? If the intent is to fund only one provider, Alameda County has done this in the past (e.g. funded only one or two programs and they have not been as effective) . The services mentioned above could be achieved through case managers and peer counselors and a half time or less program assistant for handle data reporting. A team lead/program manager at 25% FTE would also be sufficient. When the funds are smaller and more equitably distributed among providers there is more of an incentive to collaborate to lever age resources and also keep the overall African American Full Service Partnership goals in the missi on driven vision of BHCS. Recommend funding four (4) FSP at $125,000 each and see how they do in leveraging those funds to meet the needs of the consumer s they would be contracted to fund. You would at least increase the likelihood of more streamlined, client -centered strategies and an incentive to the providers to carefully plan their services for strategic impact during ramp up. The African American co mmunity is very heterogeneous. You could get more bang for the people's buck by funding four providers all the same and each one bring a component of the array of services you are seeking. The number of providers will be based on the responses to the Request For Proposals (RFP). The majority of our current Full Service Partnerships are implemented by one provider or two providers in partnership. $500,000 is for the start -up year while $1M will be the ongoing annual budget. The current design of Full Servic e Partnerships requires a wide array of services and resources that is normally available only to a larger scale program with more staff employed to serve a higher number of clients. However, BHCS will examine different approaches in the design and development phase of this program. My primary question centers on what input did the African American community fulfill in influencing this process? The concept of this program was based on service statistics that show African American males as the largest group receiving services in our most restrictive settings which include locked psychiatric facilities and criminal justice settings. As this plan on ly represents the budgeting of funding for this program, BHCS will engage the African American Steering Committee to provide input on the final design of the program. Since most FSPs serve a large percentage of African American consumers, it would benefit our System of Care to have some of the funds be dedicated to the training and resources needed for current FSPs to include culturally responsive practices that are not already included in the current FSPs. This strategy addresses cultural responsiveness of a single new FSP but does not address the further development of culturally responsive practices in the existing FSPs. Funds for the training of current FSP staff will be budgeted separate from this program.

Please provide at least 20% of the designated resources to African American Transition Age Youth and Adult female consumers, who are often mothers, care- givers, silently struggling with depression and other mental health struggles. African American women, chi ldren and families will be served in 1.B - PEI 20. OESD 23 - Community -Based, Voluntary Crisis Services Public Comment Response People would rather go to service providers in their neighborhoods. As a consumer I strongly support this initiative. I want service providers for this initiative to be African American for the African American communities. I want the care providers of this initiative to be Black agencies with Black staff who knowledgeable about Black psychology as a science and who are grounded in the science of Black psychology. I want the coordination and efforts of the initiative designers to be with the Association of Black Psychologists. Cultural competence in serving all clients of crisis services, including African Americans, will be an important consideration in the design and development of these programs. At the appropriate phase, providers and associations with this expertise may be consulted to ensure such competencies are reflected in the final program requirements and scope of ser vices. Expand Sausal Creek - or locate other services in south county. There is limited crisis response and it is in Oakland. There is a need for an active car in South County: increase for cars for Crisis R esponse programs both north and south county; I suggest incorporating a car for each: GART, Tri- valley, Tri- cities and unincorporated areas. When someone needs help - if they do need to end up going to John George involuntarily - that person has to be transported - is there room on the John George campus - another building? - that could serve as a diversion from needing to wait until some- one needs to be 5150'd - a voluntary facility on the John George campus for crisis service expans ion. We need more room for people who need the involuntary facilities - do not diminish the facility for involuntary while expanding the voluntary. Each of these suggestions will be reviewed in the crisis planning process.

The vast majority of MET calls are not for suicidal ideation /plan/intent, but for co- occurring MH and SUD conditions related to homelessness and behaviors that warrant police attention. Might these funds be better served through continued training of law enforcement regarding psychiatric conditions and how to intervene in strength based and empath etic manner? MET funding is listed under PEI 12 because the MET Team responds to individuals in psychiatric crisis, inclu ding suicidal ideation, in order to provide the appropriate assessment and level of care through a clinician and officer team. In ad dition to the MET funding, BHCS is in its fourth year of providing funding for Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) for all Alameda County law enforcement departments and dispatch units. CIT is comprised of 18 modules including a consumer and family member panel and a cultural diversity module, both of which are strengths based and aim to increase officers knowledge and empathy. So this is a direct contract with CSS, not out for bid? Yes, this is an expansion of an existing contract. PEI 15 - ACCESS for API Population; PEI 16 - ACCESS for Latino Population Public Comment Response I applaud many of the programs in terms of trying to get some of the gaps, there hadn't really been a prevention program that gears more to a cultural approach to the African- American population, there hadn't been a lot of geographic diversity so I'm glad to see some of those. I know there's been a lot of work by a lot people to come with these programs, I don't see any that don't have tremendous value in to address the gap that's not taking away this issue about what are the outcomes. The reason I'm here t oday to ask in preparation of the next plan. When we started this program with MHSA, the Latinos were served at \u00bd the rate of the general population Asian/API of 1/3 of rate we put a lot of MHSA money in programs out there and that disparity still there to day, I don't see a single program that is really addressing getting at that disparity and it probably take a planning process as there was one for the African- American prevention program, my request for today is not a criticism of many of these programs I truly don't know the Over the next three year period, the accumulated unspent MHSA funds are projected to be exhausted; all existing programs are being reassessed and evaluated for their relevance and effectiveness. Under this review, some programs may be expanded if the program effectiveness matches the community need.

Other comments are available upon request. 4 depths of any of these they sound like they do address some of the gaps but in terms of these gaps serving Latino population and the Asian/API they've been underserved for a long time, there's been a lot of change in the programs but i t doesn't really change the disparity my request for today is we will have another plan update my hope for BHCS is that we can start to talk together as a community about what can we do we know that specifically design program really can infuse in populati on that are necessarily so trusting these big partnership that supposed to serve everybody we know that there are population continue to be underserved that are not specifically design from a more cultural or linguistic place. I think we are addressing som e of the gaps and in particular geography I really pleased to see that East county is getting more services and also I know there's a group working on African- American Prevention Strategy. I think we put a lot of programs out there but still disparity for Latinos and API community is not changing. We need some very specific program to address this. PEI 18 - Behavioral Health Medical Home Public Comment Response Half of the Adult Service Teams are county operated and half are CBO operated. This funding should be used to build primary care clinics at CBO Service Team sites since prior MHSA funding was already used to build primary care clinics at BHCS operated site of Oakland CCS. There is already a dispar ity in the system of care and this strategy seems to further divide the system. There are many CBO Service Team sites that would be able to build primary care availability on site in partnership with an FQHC with this level of funding. It is suggested that these funds be targeted to Service Teams that focus on serving BHCS's most underserved target populations (Latinos, Asians) which no other strategy addresses like geography which is addressed in the next strategy Our long term goal is to integrate primar y care with as many of our service teams as possible future funding permitting.

Other comments are available upon request. 5 PEI 20 - Culturally -Responsive Programs f or African American Community Public Comment Response The funding level for such a large percentage of community members is not sufficient. At least $500,000 to $750,000 more is far more equitable considering how similar programs have been funded for other cultural communities over the last five years or so. With an investment of an additional $750,000 taken from some of the other higher funded projects, you could essentially fund 10 projects at $125,000 and truly start to build stronger collaboration among African American cultural providers. The problem of competition for scarce resources would be eliminated as equity would require all programs to fit their models to a $125,000 budget. And, again, over time they can strategically strengthen their programs and services rather than trying to do too much with more money than is needed to meet the people where they are at. Alameda County has had a long tradition of competitive contracting vs. collaborative and that funding allocation formula may work for traditional mental health programs but it is culturally incongruent to African American cultural values, beliefs and traditions as a communal people. It would be greatly appreciated if BHCS wo uld encourage embedding those cultural values throughout its system of care. Collaboration is empowering, competition has fueled the fragmented systems that have plagued African Americans in Alameda County for a very long time. Incentives for collaboration among the funded providers would also be a powerful system transformation consideration. Incentives in the form of ability to attend the annual cultural competence trainings support to develop evaluation or data collection tools and databases unless you would require use of Insyst. Discounts with your printers and desk top publishing companies for creating health promotion materials and special project funds to encourage community members to get involved in the efforts and you could set the parameters of the special projects (e.g. potted cherry tomato plants for disadvantaged African American families who live in public housing but could as a part of self care/homework or whatever strategy designed the families would receive their fresh vegetable pots to grow on the balconies. Children and family support could include assigning chores and parenting the potted garden growing child (or children and assigning chores of using the watering can to water the plants, etc. This helps to develop a focus on grow ing their own food and bringing the family together. Over the next three year period, the accumulated unspent MHSA funds are projected to be exhausted; all existing programs are being reassessed and evaluated for their relevance and effectiveness. Under t his review, some programs may be expanded if the program effectiveness matches the community need. These programmatic ideas can be considered by the African American Steering Committee in their recommendations for program design.

Other comments are available upon request. 6 My first question center s on what input did the African American community fulfill in influencing this process? Secondly, what factors were used to set the allocation limits and range? The goals of Prevention & Early Intervention programs are sufficiently broad to address many o f the recommendation from the African American Utilization Report (2011). As this plan only represents the budgeting of funding for this program, BHCS will engage the African American Steering Committee to provide input on the final design of the programs. The allocation for this was established to match the budgeted amount for 1.A. - FSP 10. 1 Bonita House, Inc.

REGIONAL EXPANSION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -PRIMARY CARE INTEGRATION FY 14/15 FY 15/16 FY $6,164,103 $1,419,722 $1,288,472 Program Description: Provide BHCS consumers with serious mental illness with access to integrated primary health care services in multiple Alameda County Mental Health Community Support Centers. FY 14/15 Plan: Implement the Promoting Access to Healthcare (PATH) Project at Eden Adult Community Support Center by February, 2015, and operate two half day primary care clinics at the site by June 30, 2015, with at 95 enrolled program participants. Using the PATH Project's integration model, implement a half time primary care service in collaboration with Ti burcio Vasquez Health Center at the BHCS Gail Steel Wellness and Recovery Center in Hayward, California by May 25, 2015. Working in collaboration with the BHCS Substance Abuse Administration staff, identify at least two ways that SMI consumers served by BHCS community support centers and full service partnerships can have improved access to substance abuse treatment and recovery services available in Alameda County. Work with the Alameda Health Consortium to develop ways to get access to the physical health information on SMI consumers served by their network of community health centers so that the PATH Project can better monitor the impact of integrated care on emergency room utilization, hospitalizations (psyc hiatric and medical), and criminal justice contacts. FY 15/16 - FY 16/17 Plans: Work collaboratively with the BHCS Information System Office to make sure that the new Electronic Health Record System can be utilized by the behavioral and primary care staff that is a part of the PATH Project to share health information on program participants. Monitor PATH Project staff to ensure that they are billing Medi -Cal for the client services at the BHCS, adult community support centers. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 5 Rev. March 2015 FY 14/15 FY 15/16 FY 16/17 PEI 9 Axis Healthcare $1.2M 0. 0. Program Description: Eastern Alameda County is the fastest growing area in the county and with this rapid growth is a surge in residents who have incomes below 200% of FPL. Axis Community Health is the sole provider of primary care services for the indigent and uninsured population of eastern Alameda County/Tri -Valley. Axis received designation as a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) in 2009. Axis has moved quickly to expand services, capacity and efficiency, with achievements including the receipt of Level 2 PCMH (Patient -Centered Medical Home) designation, full implementation of electronic health records at all sites and in both medical and behavioral health services, and the implementation of integrated behavioral health services. Axis has also received recognition from HRSA (US Health Resources and Services Administration) for exemplary access to care in its prenatal services. Based on demographic and public health data and population growth trends, ACA implementation would add 9,000 - 10,000 Medi -Cal-eligible patients to the pool of potential Axis patients. The service capacity needed to provide these patients with access to medical homes would be in excess of 75,000 visits annually \u2014more than doubl e the 36,000 visits Axis provided in FY 12/13.

March 2015 6. UNACCOMPANIED YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FY 14/15 FY 15/16 FY 16/17 PEI 1.B/C Addition to School -Based Mental Health Consultation in Elementary - High Schools $500,000 $1,000,000 $1,000,000 There are significant health -related issues faced by unaccompanied youth in Alameda County. Healthcare Services Agency has assessed that a large number of unaccompanied youth are enrolled in the Oakland Unified School District and other school districts with large Latino student populations. While this issue requires an urgent and immediate response, ongoing services may be required to address the long -term needs of this population. Healthcare Services Agency has a significant investment with 26 school health centers in 14 school districts and school -based behavioral health services in 160 schools throughout the county. This new program will leverage these investments and expand capacity of the various \"portals to healthcare\" to effectively address trauma, other health concerns and caregiver support needs of unaccompanied youth. Program Strategies: Establish \"No Wrong Door\" resources for school and community -based providers to enable billing for providing trauma- informed behavioral health care services. Mobilize the School Health Centers (including Fuentes Wellness Center, REACH Youth Center in Ashland) to serve unaccompanied youth, working with lead health providers to address some of the barriers to financing their care. Partner with school districts throughout the County to implement strategies for early identification and triage to address urgent health and mental health issues. Mobilize a team of one Clinical Case Manager and two Parent Partners (with Spanish and Mama language capacity) to interface with various partners to ensure that unaccompanied youth and their families/caregivers have appropriate access to health services and supports. Deploy youth peer -to-peer outreach and care coordination leveraging our youth development provider community. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 9 Rev. March 2015III.

For previous FY 12 -13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : Number of clients served: 44 Number of new enrollments: 14 Number of discharges to lower level of care: 14 Number of clients who avoided psychiatric hospitalizations during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 93%, 13 of 14 clients - 6 months: 93%, 13 of 14 clients - 12 months: 93%, 13 of 14 clients Number of clients who avoided medical hospitalizations during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 100%, 14 of 14 clients - 6 months: 93%, 13 of 14 clients - 12 months: 100%, 14 of 14 clients Number of clients who retained housing of their choice during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 84%, 12 of 14 clients - 6 months: 84%, 12 of 14 clients - 12 months: 93%, 13 of 14 clients Number of clients who received primary care serves within the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 100%, 14 of 14 clients - 6 months: 100%, 14 of 14 clients - 12 months: 100% 14 of 14 clients Participants receiving support from NCSHP have had success connecting to primary care services. Supporting participants to receive primary care is critical for the older adult population, many of whom have been disengaged from both physical and mental health services for many years resulting in complex needs that require intensive care coordination. The team meets the challenges that arise for participants when mental health related symptoms, such as paranoid ideation, manifest as behavior that are often received as a barrier to health care services by providers in the community. NCSHP team members use a flexi ble and person- centered approach to support participants to accept care. For example, participants may be open to receiving psycho- education on topics such as diabetes in their home prior to accepting medical care for such conditions. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 23 Rev. March 2015For current FY 13-14 Progress Report : Number of clients served: 37 Number of new enrollments: 8 Number of discharges to lower level of care: 6 Number of clients who avoided psychiatric hospitalizations during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 87% , 7 of 8 clients - 6 months: 100%, 8 of 8 clients - 12 months: 87%, 7 of 8 clients Number of clients who avoided medical hospitalizations during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 100%, 8 of 8 clients - 6 months: 87%, 7 of 8 clients - 12 months: 100%, 8 of 8 clients Number of clients who retained housing of their choice during the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 87%, 7 of 8 clients - 6 months: 87%, 7 of 8 clients - 12 months: 100%, 8 of 8 clients Number of clients who received primary care serves within the following initial enrollment periods: - 3 months: 100%, 8 of 8 clients - 6 months: 100%, 8 of 8 clients - 12 months: 100% 8 of 8 clients For the current year 36 of 37 NCSHP participants have spent 0 nights as homeless. The team has had success working with participants to utilize resources in their communities and natural supports to find shelter and housing. Early in the year the team promoted a peer support counselor who had been with the program since the inception of the program. While the promotion was well deserved and the staff person is still with the organization, the absence of this team member left a personnel and service gap. The team strategized for appropriate terminations between the staff person and participants. The team is actively pursuing qualified candidates with lived experience to fill the position by June 2014. For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15 -16, FY16 -17 Plans : The NCSHP team will serve a total of 40 partners at any given time in the coming fiscal year. BACS will explore cost effectiveness and client care benefits of providing psychiatry in house and primary care services as part of the organization's continuum of care. BACS considers the increased access health care as a primary benefit to NCSHP participants. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 24 Rev. March 2015FSP 3. Supportive Housing for Transition Age Youth (STAY) Program Description: Provides permanent supportive housing for youth who are homeless, are aged out of foster care, leaving the justice system or residential treatment. For previous FY 12 -13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : On average, STAY served 48 participants who were homeless or imminently homeless at the time they entered the program, thus reducing homelessness in the community. Based on MORS scores and hospitalization and incarceration data provided at the time of enrollment, STAY continued to reduce the number of hospitalizations and incarcerations by stabilizing participants in the community via intensive community based case management services. Of these 73% were safely housed in either permanent or transitional housing. STAY implemented SAMHSA evidence- based practice of Individualized Placement Support/Supported Education to assist these young adults to gain competitive employment, and our first participant in that program obtained competitive employment in May. STAY also successfully implemented three new groups: one peer support group for young women, one DBT group and one peer support group for young men. We also successfully implemented a new housing subsidy plan that encourages participants to engage in productive activities (e.g. employment) to increase their income. 55% of participants who were discharged were transitioned with permanent housing in place and to a lower level of care. The number of participants exiting STAY on a planned basis to the same or lower level of care was 90% compared to 75% during the 2011/12 fiscal year. Over the year we increased the percentage of participants who were linked to primary care from 33% to 50%. For the first half of the fiscal year an average of 44% of participants were seeking employment (e.g. engaged in supportive employment programs or actively working with STAY team to explore employment options). For the second half of the fiscal year the number of participants seeking employment increased to an average of 53%. For current FY 13 -14 Progress Report: STAY served 56 participants during the fiscal year who were homeless or at risk of homelessness and living with a significant mental health disability. As evidence of working towards our objective of assisting participants with maintaining housing stability, of the 56 served: 36 (64%) were placed in and maintained either permanent or transitional housing. During this period STAY discharged 14, 11 of which were planned discharges. Of the 11 planned discharges: 7 (64%) exited the program with permanent housing. 6 (55%) exited the program and went to a lower of care. 5 (45%) exited the program to the same level of care. During this period progress was made with regard to competitive employment. Through the SAMHSA evidenced- based practice of Individual Placement Support /Supported Employment (IPS) program which helps participants obtain competitive wage employment, STAY was able to provide Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 25 Rev. March 2015employment services to 28 participants (50% of the total number of participants served). As evidence of working towards our objective of increasing the number of participants who are competitively employed, of the 28 served by IPS participants: 12 (42%) were engaged in competitive employment at some point during the FY'13- 14. Of the 12 employed, 5 (41%) have maintained their jobs for at least 3 to 6 months. With regard to employment, STAY also became a Department of Rehab vendor which will allow us to provide participants with extra support as they work towards their vocational or educational goals. In support of our objective to increase the number of groups offered through STAY: During this period we developed and implemented two Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT) groups to assist participants with managing mental health symptoms as well as an ongoing Drop In Group for TAY that focuses on Independent Living Skills, peer connection and support, and improvement of activities of daily living. In summary: Based on Milestones of Recovery Scale (MORS), for FY'13- 14 the average number of participants that were in the 6 - 8 range on the scale (i.e. rehabilitated or in full recovery) increased slightly to approximately 40% suggesting that the trend from FY'12- 13 of decreasing hospitalizations, incarcerations and community stabilization continued; and the number of participants that exper ienced planned discharges to the same or a lower level of care increased from 90% to 100%. During the upcoming 3 year period STAY will continue to work towards starting a monthly family group as well as building upon our efforts to increase the rate at which we link participants to primary health care (and effort to be significantly supported when FFYC opens a Wellness Center in Fall '14). For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15 -16, FY16 -17 Plans: In support of the overall outcome goal of improving the participant's condition and/or life through the services we provide, STAY will focus on increasing the number of participants that retain housing as well as supporting participants with achieving their employment goals. FSP 4. Greater Hope Project Program Description: Engages homeless people through street outreach, through the HOPE Project Mobile Health Clinic and community referrals. Once engaged, the program offers housing, intensive mental health wrap- around service coordination, medication management, counseling, educational/vocational support, recreational opportunities, and peer mentoring. For previous FY 12 -13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : 32 clients avoided hospitalization - in emergency room or psychiatric facility for 3 months after enrollment in the Greater HOPE program; 35 after 6 months of enrollment; and, 36 after 12 months of enrollment. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 26 Rev. March 2015 34 clients retained housing of their choice fo r 3 months after enrollment in the Greater HOPE program; 36 for 6 months after enrollment and 38 for 12 months after enrollment in the Greater HOPE program. 30 clients received primary care services within 3 months after enrollment in the Greater HOPE program; 35 after 6 months in the program and 41 after 12 months in the program. Many of these individuals were highly visible in the Southern, Eastern, and Central part of Alameda County as well as high end users of emergency services until they were subsequently housed and began receiving Greater HOPE services. There continues to be a far greater need in the community than there are resources. Affordable housing in Southern and Eastern Alameda continues to be a challenge. Additionally, vacancy rates are so low in these areas, land lord are choosing to work with subsidized housing program less often and this can make finding housing challenging. With regards to moving people on to other housing in the community, there are few affordable or subsidized options in Southern and Eastern Alameda county. Moving on for people in the Greater HOPE program, often means uprooting everything and moving to Oakland to a brand new and unfamiliar community. For current FY 13 -14 Progress Report: Greater HOPE is in th e process of determining those 5- 7 participants that could move on to a lower level of care and receive a housing subsidy through an alternative source. Some of these participants may continue to receive Greater HOPE services during a transitional period. Conversely, other participants may be at a place in their recovery that they are able to find employment and become increasingly impendent of outside resources. Simultaneously, Greater HOPE continues to get referrals and engage in outreach to some of the m ost highly visible homeless members of our community. For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Plans: Greater HOPE will continue to target housing, case management, mental health, psychiatric, vocational rehabilitation and primary care services to 43 severely mentally ill adult participants The program will be moving to Hayward within the next 6 months. As we move people out of Southern and Eastern Alameda county into more affordable housing in Central and Northern Alameda County, the program will be more centrally located and thus be accessible to program participants. Greater HOPE also will continue to consider strategies to address the need to broaden our efforts within the scope of available resource. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 27 Rev. March 2015FSP 5. Forensic Assertive Community Treatment (FACT) Program Description: Forensic Assertive Community Treatment (FACT), a program of the East Bay Community Recovery Project, is funded by MHSA Prop 63 through its contract with Alameda County Behavioral Health Care. FACT specifically serves persons who have a history of excess utilization of the criminal justice system \u2014jail and court services \u2014and psychiatric and medical emergency services. These individuals have long histories of living with severe mental health and co-occurring substance misuse and other medical issues. FACT follows the ACT model, which utilizes a multi- disciplinary treatment team to provide assertive outreach and engagement to this population. Once engaged, FACT provides subsidized housing, intensive case management, psychosocial habilitation or rehabilitation for daily living, psychiatric evaluation and treatment, medical triage, substance misuse counseling and assistance to detox/treatment, individual and group peer support, employment and educational assistance, and crisis intervention services. FACT provides the vast majority of its services in the community, meeting our partners \"where they are.\" For previous FY 12 -13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : The program implemented the use of the Milestones of Recovery Scale as a tool to support the teams clinical dec isions in determining partner's readiness for transition to a lower level of care. Several FACT partners have successfully graduated and transitioned to Wellness centers for continued support. The FACT program continued to reduce and in most cases eliminate its participant's involvement in the criminal justice system and or their need for psychiatric emergency services. Partners continued to be supported in their efforts for beginning and or returning to school and competitive employment. All graduates are living in affordable housing that is subsidized independent of the program. The graduates participated in our monthly leadership group which plays an integral role in the mentoring of new partners and the planning for and participation in our on- going com munity meetings. Streamlining of measures compendium administered to partners to effectively and efficiently measure change over time Increased support and technical assistance from an external evaluator to help prepare Annual Program Report For current FY 13 -14 Progress Report: FACT is continuing to graduate individuals from the program and transition them to a lower level of care for continuing less intensive services. As of July 2014 FACT has graduated and transitioned a total of 14 participants all of whom have stabilized and have not accessed psychiatric or medical emergency services or been incarcerated in at least 6 months or longer. These graduates are now receiving treatment services through wellness centers, service teams, or through private providers in the community. For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Plans: Continue implementation and graduation plan for partners. FSP 6. Transition to Independence (TIP) Program Description: Provides intensive mental health services to transition- age youth who are experiencing severe mental illness, aged out of foster care, leaving the justice system, or residential treatment. For previous FY 12 -13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : TIP served a total of 37 clients. On average, participants' hospital admissions in the first 12 months after enrollment was decreased by 41%; number of participants enrolled in schools (GED, community colleges, UC system) increased by 27%; 95% participan ts are housed (14 participants Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 28 Rev. March 2015obtained independent housing through MHSA and Section 8; 13 participants retained housing of their choice (living with parents or family members); number of participants who are employed increased by 8% (competitive and supported employment). One of the biggest challenges was the lack of permanent housing and competitive employment for TAYs. In order to encourage independent living for our TAYs, participants are encouraged to apply for affordable housing opportunities in different cities and counties. In terms of employment, participants are encouraged to apply for supported employment, volunteer opportunities, and vocational trainings to build up their resumes. Based on a Total of 37 participants Psychiatric Hospitalizat ions Number of psychiatric hospital admissions: o 12 months prior to enrollment 86 o First 12 months of enrollment 35 o Decrease in number of hospital admission 41% Education Number of participants in school or taking classes o 12 months prior to enrollment 6 o First 12 months of enrollment 10 o Increase in number of participants in school or taking classes 60% Housing Number of participants who obtained independent housing of their choice: 14 Number of participants who retained housing of their choice (living with parents or family members): 13 Number of participants who are homeless: 2 Employment Number of participants who are employed: o 12 months prior to enrollment 0 o First 12 months of enrollment 0 o Most recent 12 months of post enrollment 3 o Increase in number of participants who are employed 8% For current FY 13 -14 Progress Report: TIP serves participants who live throughout Alameda County. For the current year, TIP collaborated with FERC/Transitiona l Age Youth- Family Member to increase support to our participants, family members, and care takers as well as increasing their skills in learning and implementing WRAP. For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Plans: Continue to support the transition of TAYs to independent living by obtaining or retaining housing of their choice, by completing educational goals, and by obtaining competitive employment. Expand services to 40 TAYs per year. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 29 Rev. March 2015FSP 7. CHOICES for Community Living Program Description: This FSP is a transformational progra m for Service Teams that integrates supportive housing, supportive employment, peer counseling and strength- based and person- centered case management to enable clients to graduate into a fuller life in the community without the need for the Service Team. FY 12/13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Throughout the year, one hundred and eighty two (182) unique Partners were served from three different cohorts in the CHOICES Program. CHOICES celebrated its first graduation event on October 31st, 2013 with fifty -eight (58) Partners from the first cohort successfully completing the program. Partners and their families were extremely proud of their accomplishments. Many Partners shared about their journey publicly at the event. Each Partner received a framed letter from President Obama congratulating them on their accomplishment. Thirty -four (34) Partners were actually discharged from their Service Team. Partners that did not achieve fully graduation will continue to work on their recovery path while still needing the additional supports provided by the Service Team staff. While all stakeholders in the CHOICES Program were planning the first graduation event, five (5) additional teams were being oriented toward starting a third cohort in November/ December of 2013. The orientation process involves engaging the managers of each program to insure that the organization and new CHOICES case manager from that team are aligned with the vision and values of the MHSA/CHOICES Program. In addition, there are technology and documentation requirements that each team must become oriented to as well. The second cohort continued their journey with fifty (50) active Partners out of the original (57) Partners who enrolled in the CHOICES Program. Housing Services O utcomes: Eighty -nine percent (89%) of the CHOICES Partners from the first two cohorts who sought housing services reported that they were in their preferred or most preferred housing. Seventy -two percent (72%) of CHOICES Partners from cohort #1 had been able to maintain independent living or improved their independent living environments prior to graduation. Sixty- five percent (65%) of CHOICES Partners from cohort #2 were able to maintain their independent living or improved their independent living environments by February 2014. Employment Services Outcomes : Seventy -seven (77) CHOICES Partners from the first two cohorts who sought supported employment (IPS) services achieved their preferred or most preferred employment outcomes. This represents a Seventy -three percent (73%) success rate. Fifty-eight (58) Partners received job placements in competitive employment jobs. Forty -two (42) Partners worked for more than 90 days in these placements. Some Partners started the CHOICES Program with pre- existing competitive employment jobs. Wellness, Recovery and Resiliency Outcomes: Survey instruments were conducted by Consumer Research Assistants designed to measure changes in functioning, well -being, recovery and quality of life. The annual surveys consisted of an hour long interview and a compilation of (212) items from several integrated survey instruments. These surveys were measured upon admission in the program and yearly thereafter. Almost every recovery marker showed a statistically significant improvement in overall Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 30 Rev. March 2015functioning. In cohort #1 there was a 24% improvement in living situation; a 15% improvement in talk/get together with family and a 12% improvement in being comfortable about money resources. In cohort #2 there was a 21% improvement in living situation; a 17% improvement regarding their Stage of Recovery and a 15% improvement regarding their perceived progress. Challenges: During the CHOICES Program, seventeen (17) Partners required acute hospitalization. CHOICES Recovery Coaches and Personal Service Coordinators continued to provide support to these Partners resulting in eight (8) of those Partners continuing with the CHOIC ES Program after discharge from the acute facility. Additionally, eleven (11) Partners became incarcerated while participating in the CHOICES Program. The CHOICES staff continued to provide support to these Partners and seven (7) of these Partners were able to continue in the CHOICES Program after being released from jail. Partners reported no significant change in some of the following areas: o The way things are in general with my family o Feeling safe from victimization o Indicators for substance abuse o Takin g medications just as they are prescribed o Losing control of behavior Team Facilitation and Accountability : Facilitation of Team Meetings that integrates services from three different domains and organizations from nine different team cultures continues to be a challenge. The domains of housing, employment and recovery coaching each have their own language, bes t practices, values and perspectives. It should be noted that the Personal Service Coordinator and their supervisor do not directly supervise the other domains that are at the table. Coordinating the various services/service providers and strength- based p erson- centered treatment planning in collaboration with the Partner both continue to be challenging for the teams to accomplish; even though there is a great benefit to the diverse perspectives that are shared with everyone in the team. Staff/Systems Cha nge Outcomes Reported but not Quantitatively Measured: Change in how Housing, Employment and Recovery Coaching Programs organize, supervise and deliver services because of the CHOICES Program. Change in CHOICES staff approaches to working with clients on their recovery. Change in broader BHCS system approach to working with clients on their recovery. Improvements in CHOICES team integration of working among the four domains (i.e. a model for disseminating this out to the larger BHCS system.) Change in non- CHOICES service team staff in their approach to working with clients on their recovery. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 31 Rev. March 2015FY 13/14 Progress Report: The third cohort has become increasingly engaged with housing, employment and wellness classes at the CHOICES Learning Center. The program continues to adjust the approach based on the continuous quality improvement process that staff and Partners are actively engaged with. The second cohort is actively preparing for graduation. It became very clear with the first cohort graduation that primary care and community psychiatry are resources that need to be engaged early in order to get Partners well connected before graduation. The CHOICES all- staff meeting continues to provide educational opportunities to integrate best practices into the services being provided. So far, there have been presentations on how to provide supported educational opportunities for Partners that may want to pursue a career path that requires a certificate or degree. There have been presentations on benefits, housing first, and managing transitions as individuals and as a program experiencing a significant degree of change. FY 14/15 Plans: CHOICES Policy Committee, CHOICES Operations Group, Service Team Directors and Partners are reviewing what we have learned in CHOICES that has worked very effectively to help facilitate the process of recovery and eventual graduation from Service Teams to a fuller life in the community. It is clear from these focused conversations that the dedicated resources of recovery coaches, employment specialists, housing specialists and a recovery learning center with a program coordinator are necessary to continue the MHSA transformation of sixteen service teams in twelve programs, .The CHOICES Program is reviewing the most effective approach to utilizing these existing resources to support the 3,500 consumers on these service teams; as well as the staff at all levels to continue to support recovery journey progress and graduation from service teams to a fuller life in the community. FY 15/16 Plans: The CHOICES staff in the domains of employment, housing and recovery coaching/wellness classes can be effectively re sourced to serve at least two hundred (200) consumers from 12 Service Team sites each year. The transition from a three year CHOICES program to a set of resources that will be more fully integrated into twelve (12) Service Team sites will take this year to work out all of the challenges with this change in the program. This change will allow consumers at each of these 12 Service Team sites to access IPS employment supports, educational supports, housing supports and wellness/recovery supports when they are ready to become active in any of these targeted services. The Program Director will be responsible to insure effective integration of the best practices from these three domains into the (12) Service Team sites as well as a continuation of integrating strength -based person -centered and accountable team practices in each of these programs. FY 16/17 Plans: The resources from the CHOICES Program will be fully integrated into all Twelve (12) Service Team sites serving over 200 consumers every year. The Service Teams will be successfully graduating one hundred (100) or more Partners every year. Consumers from each site will be able to access classes focusing on recovery in each of the domains of wellness as soon as they express an interest, such as WRAP, wel lness, community Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 32 Rev. March 2015resources, and graduation readiness. Consumers from each site will be able to get an employment specialist to work with them on obtaining competitive part time or full time employment as soon as they express an interest. Consumers from each site will be able to learn about creating a home for themselves and what options and resources are available to obtain affordable housing. Consumers will have a place to go to find peer support, learn and grow and discover their hopes and dreams to create a better life for themselves in the community. FSP 9. Behavioral Health Court (BHC) , Transitional Assertive Community Treatment (TrACT) Team Program Description: TrACT (Transitional Assertive Community Treatment) a program of the East Bay Community Recovery Project is contracted through Alameda County Behavioral Health Care using MHSA Prop 63 funding. TrACT, a full service partnership program, is the dedicated serv ice provider for the Alameda County Behavioral Health Court and is to maintain an active caseload of 20 participants. TrACT has been providing intensive wraparound mental health, co- occurring substance misuse and other health related services to participants of the court program since August 2009. This court -supervised program is for adult individuals arrested in Alameda County and are awaiting their court appearance either in custody or in the community. These individuals have a mental health condition that is severe in degree and persistent in duration. This condition has to have been a determining factor for the commission of their offence. BHC/TrACT is voluntary in nature and individuals choose to participate in the court program instead of having their cases proceed in the regular court process. Their charge or qualifying charges, as related to this particular offence, is expunged from their record with their successful completion of the BHC program. For previous FY 12 -13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges : TrAct had an average monthly census of 18 partners and six newly enrolled partners. TrAct discharged partners with a completion of at least 6 months in the program, all of which had income, insurance benefits, housing, and primary medical care. TrAct g raduated partners who were transferred to service teams and wellness centers. Streamlining of measures compendium administered to partners to effectively and efficiently measure change over time Increased support and technical assistance from an external evaluator to help prepare Annual Program Report For current FY 13 -14 Progress Report: Seven participants successfully completed the Behavioral Health Court July 8, 2014, and have been referred to a lower level of care for services. This is the largest number of graduates since the court's inception and is a significant accomplishment given that maintaining mental health stability and sobriety over the course of the 12 month TrACT and 24 month BHC program has proven difficult for participants over the first several years of the program. Relapse is often a part of a participants' experience with the TrACT and court program. The key to an individual's ability to commence from the court is their desire to do whatever it takes, with support services from the TrACT team and encouragement from the Court, to achieve sobriety and mental health stability. Permanent housing and housing, employment, and education support services are key to individuals' wellness and recovery efforts as they address common issues of loneliness and boredom and help to meet the hopes and dreams of the participants. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 33 Rev. March 2015For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Plans: Continue implementation and graduation plan for partners. OESD 4A. Mobile Integrated Assessment Team for Older Adults Program Description: Increases access for homebound seniors through the use of mobile geriatric mental health teams. FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Exceeded contracted units of service. Provided 847 home visits to 85 older adults to reduce isolation; decrease 911 calls and ER visits. Through counseling and medication management supported clients with severe mental illness to remain successfully living at home. Client's need case management support to coordinate complex health needs, including chronic disease manage ment and acute medical needs. Many clients have not accessed mental health services in the past and have a lot of unmet needs. FY 14/15 Plans: Increased support for clients through intern partnerships with several Schools of Social Work/Counseling. Currently have 6 interns embedded in program. Close collaboration with Afghan Elderly Association to support older Afghan adults with PTSD/Anxiety symptoms. Holding support groups at Senior Housing that has dedicated ACBHCS residents to increase access to ser vices. The clients who discharged from the program last year had an average length of stay of 5.5 months. It is challenging for clients, especially those who are isolated, to discharge from the program. We hope to develop more step- down options for clients in the future. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 34 Rev. March 2015OESD 5A - 5B. Crisis Response Program - Trivalley & Tricities Program Description: Augment ACCESS services with clinical and peer staff dedicated to East and South County. FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: CRP sites continue to assign to Level 1 and Level 2 Programs. There has been an ongoing need for additional services, particularly Level 2, in East County. Many consumers who had Health PAC transitioned to MediCal. This was not a smooth process and impacted CRP's ability to refer consumers to appropriate resources. Our Livermore office is co- located with FERC (Family Education Resource Center). Initially, this co-location was going to include additional programs, but that did not happen so there are very few employees at this site. The site is located away from many of the other services that our consumers use and there is very little \"walk in\" traffic. East County Crisis Response Programs served 134 consumers in 2013. Fremont CRP served 292 consumers in 2013. FY 14/15 Progress Report: Portia Bell Hume is now offering Level II services in East County . Fremont CRP continues to serve a culturally diverse group of consumers. CRP hired a new psychiatrist in our Fremont site. She has worked with CRP for four years in East C ounty and previously worked at Tri City Community support Center for 14 years so she is very familiar with the population and services available in the area. Though MediCal can still take some time to get approved, the process is running a bit more smoothl y and consumers are able to get services more timely. CRP has met with Livermore PD and Pleasanton PD and can consult and collaborate with local law enforcement as needed. The East County CRP clinician continues to provide community outreach and partner w ith agencies as needed. There is not adequate staffing available at the Livermore site to provide necessary support so Livermore residents will be served at the Pleasanton site for the time being. Once another location is identified, services may resume in Livermore. East County provided services to 147 consumers and to 233 consumers in Fremont in 2014 . FY 15/16, 16/17 Plans: No significant changes planned. OESD 7. Mental Health Court Specialist (Court Advocacy Program) Program Description: Increase access to community mental health services and reduce recidivism through advocacy and release planning for the chronic and severe mentally Ill population in the criminal justice system. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 35 Rev. March 2015FY 12/13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: On a daily basis CAP staff connect criminal justice- involved individuals with mental illnesses to appropriate community service programs based on individual needs. Community programs include mental health treatment providers, case management teams, dual diagnosis services, housing, referrals to sub acute facilities etc. CAP staff provides direct and indirect services such as consultation, assisting other agencies, facilitating connections / services for clients, advocating with attorneys and judges, etc. Currently, the data / statistics on indirect services is not tracked. The only data that is available is for clients who are officially opened to BHCS direct services. Community Impact : On a daily basis, CAP staff work across multiple agency lines to 1. successfully connect clients with appropriate community services, 2. prevent clients from leaving jail without a follow -up care plan and housing, 3. reduce / mitigate the length and impact of incarceration. Without CAP assistance, many clients would have longer jail stays, and, when released, would leave jail without any assistance. We have not had the capacity to track this data. CAP staff work with court personnel to reduce criminal charges and length of time in jail for clients with mental illnesses by securing placements / community care plans. We have not had the capacity to track this data . Challenges: 1. Availability and access to community programs. Community programs may be full or not willing to accept referred clients. 2. A system is needed to gather and track the full range of CAP staff activities. 3. Streamline the jail release process for CAP clients to simplify and make more efficient. 4. Difficulty engaging clients who are resistive to, or refuse services and continue to cycle in and out of jail. 5. Cooperation of some court personnel (such as defense attorneys) who may seek different outcomes for their clients. 6. Mental health education for court staff including judges and attorneys. 7. Relationship- building with court staffs can be challenging due to frequent rotation of judges and attorneys. FY 13/14 Progress Report: There have been some staffing changes over the past year which has impacted coverage in some courtrooms. CAP staff continues to work in selected courtrooms primarily in Oakland and Hayward. CAP staff provides some assistance to clients referred from Fremont and Pleasanton courtrooms. CAP staff assist the new TAY program, REFOCUS, with referrals. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 36 Rev. March 2015FY 14/15 Plans: Adults, over 18, are served by the CAP program including TAY and Older Adults. The numbers vary according to how many in each age group are brought to the attention of CAP staff. CAP staff are located in select Alameda County Superior Courts. For the upcoming three years, (2014- 2017) the CAP staff will continue to assist in diverting eligible individuals from the criminal justice system into community services with the goal of connecting persons to appropriate services and limiting their criminal justice i nvolvement. CAP staff will provide assessments and consultation, and will coordinate placement referrals. The challenges mentioned in the preceding years, will become goals for future Improvements. Some are system - wide challenges and are beyond the control of CAP such as the availability of community resources. Limited resources impact the degree to which CAP is able to be successful in its jail diversion efforts. OESD 8. Juvenile Justice Transformation of the Guidance Clinic Program Description: Provides in- depth assessment and treatment for youth in the juvenile justice system. Creates linkages to community based services and expands on- site treatment in Juvenile Hall. FY 12/13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: One of the strategies for this program is for services to assist with re- integration into the community. This strategy had been implemented by the hiring of a Mental Health Specialist to work with youth and their families upon discharge from Juvenile Hall. This clinician helped with referral s to services and met with families in the community to assist them in making connections to the services. Recently this position became vacant as the staff member took another job and to date the position has not been filled. FY 13/14 Progress Report: In December 2013, BHCS hired a mental health clinician to work in the Transition Center. The role of the clinician will be to assess the mental health, substance abuse, and psychosocial needs of youth and their care givers and link them to service providers in the community. The clinician will also maintain an electronic database to follow -up with families via phone contacts at intervals of 30/60/90 days. Since January 2014 the Transition Center mental health clinician has met with 151 families. Approximately 15% of those families refused services. 35% of the minors were already connected to services in the community. 10% of the minors were connected to services by the Transition Center mental health clinician. 25% were lost to follow -up (runaway, never returned calls, etc.) 10% went to placement and 5% had private insurance. FY 13/14 Plans: Over the next three years, the goal is to meet with 700 families per year for the next 3 years. The Transition Center mental health clinician will meet with 1 to 3 community providers per month to increase the network of service providers that youth will be connected to upon release. Over the next three years the goal is to boost the number of families who are connected to services from 10% to 30%. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 37 Rev. March 2015OESD 9. Multi -systemic Therapy (MST) Program Description: Provides in -depth community -based assessment and treatment for youth in the juvenile justice system. MST partners with the primary caregiver and other key systems (Education, Probation) to understand the multi -systemic drivers of delinquent behavior and then empowers the primary caregiver and other systems to intervene to promote pro- social activity, family connections, and other positive outcomes. FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: MST served a total of 81 youth who are under the supervision of the Alameda County Juvenile Probation Department, including 15 youth who were carried over from the previous fiscal year, 66 youth who were accepted for services, and 47 youth who were discharged from services during this time period. Of the 47 youth discharged, 68% met the criteria for completion of MST services, signifying clear evidence of the following: primary caregiver has improved parenting skills necessary for handling subsequent problems, improved family relationships specific to the instrumental and affective domains in that family's subsystems that were drivers of the youth referral, family has improved network of informal social supports in the community and has demonstrated skill at successfully accessing a range of supports (formal and informal) as needed, youth is showing evidence of success in an educational or vocational setting, youth is involved with prosocial peers and activities and is minimally involved with problem peers, and changes in behavior of youth and in the systems contributing to the referral problems have been sustained 3- 4 weeks. A targeted area of growth for MST has been to address the rates in which youth were placed in a restrictive setting for 3 weeks or longer - a duration of time that precluded further MST involvement. This included youth who were detained at juvenile hall or residential placement. During FY 13/14, 11% of youth who discharged from MST closed due to being placed in a restrictive setting, an improvement of 16% from the previous fiscal year. Some contributing factors to this improvement include utilizing MST quarterly trainings to enhance staff's ability to develop and implement interventions that successfully address substance abuse, CBT interventions with caregivers, and developing interventions to address negative peer systems. FY 14/15 Progress Report: MST aims serve 90 -105 youth who are under the supervision of the Alameda County Juvenile Probation Department during FY 14/15. In this current fiscal year, MST has served a total of 84 youth who are under the supervision of the Alameda County Juvenile Probation Department. This includes 33 youth who were carried over from the previous fiscal year, 49 youth who were accepted for services, and 59 youth who were discharged from services during this current fiscal year. Of the 59 youth discharged, 56% met the criteria for completion of MST services, signifying clear evidence of the following: primary caregiver has improved parenting skills necessary for handling subsequent problems, improved family relationships specific to the instrumental and affective domains in that family's subsystems that were drivers of the youth referral, family has improved network of informal social supports in the community and has demonstrated skill at successfully accessing a range of supports (formal and informal) as needed, youth is showing evidence of success in an educational or vocational setting, youth is involved with prosocial peers and activities and is minimally involved with problem peers, and changes in behavior of youth and in the systems contributing to the referral problems have been sustained 3- 4 weeks. A continued target area of growth for MST is to address the rates in which youth were placed in a restrict ive setting for 3 weeks or longer - a duration of time that precluded further MST involvement. This included youth who were detained at juvenile hall or residential placement. In this current FY, 15% of youth who discharged from MST closed due to being placed in a restrictive setting, which was an increase of 4% from the previous fiscal year. MST continues to focus on reducing rates in which youth are placed in a restrictive setting for 3 weeks or longer by continuing to utilize quarterly Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 38 Rev. March 2015trainings to en hance staff's ability to develop and implement interventions that successfully address youth's referral behaviors. During this fiscal year, MST quarterly trainings have included addressing runaway behavior through intervention development and collaboration with families and probation, and interventions aimed at reducing involvement with negative peer systems. FY 15/16, 16/17 Plans: MST aims to serve 90 -105 youth who are under the supervision of the Alameda County Juvenile Probation Department during FY 15/16 and during FY 16/17. MST will continue to focus on improving treatment outcomes for youth served, with particular emphasis on increasing treatment completion rates and decreasing rates in which youth were placed in a restrictive setting for 3 weeks or longer. MST will also continue to strengthen collaboration with Probation. This information will ensure that community members, the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, and the State have an accurate picture of the positive impact of the program. OES D 11. Crisis Stabilization Services - Willow Rock Program Description: This strategy will provide crisis stabilization and acute care to youth ages 12- 17 and their families, moving them towards a reduced level of care. FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: 1,533 youth were served in the Willow Rock Crisis Stabilization Unit (CSU) with a total of approximately 1,287 unique episodes of crisis assessment and stabilization services provided. Of these youth, 88% were brought to the CSU on an involuntary hold, while 12% were walk -up clients. Based on the multidisciplinary, comprehensive assessment of the youth's needs, 49% of youth assessed at the CSU were diverted from hospitalization. Survey s of youth served in the CSU show that 92% strongly agreed that they felt welcome and safe during their time in the program. One youth stated \"I loved how throughout this entire process I never felt ashamed, the staff really listened and made me feel loved, I also appreciated how it seemed like they wanted the best for me\". Willow Rock continues to provide an integrated module of the crisis stabilization training for Alameda County police officers, covering the topic of youth mental health issues and providing tours of the facility. In addition, Willow Rock and its staff support community awareness by providing tours for school district personnel, hospital staff, and other community agencies, and engaging in collaborative efforts such as the Chief Mental Health Advisory Board for the Oakland Police Department. FY 14/15 Progress Report: While we cannot predict the clients to be served in the future due to the nature of the crisis work at the CSU, it is predicted that we will continue to see slight growth eac h year in the number of youth served by the program. We will continue to monitor and evaluate the program as well as the acuity and needs of the youth served in order to adjust to an ever changing population as indicated. OESD 13. Co -Occurring Disorders Program Program Description: Provides housing, medication assessment, evaluation, education, support and monitoring to individuals with co- occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders in alcohol and drug treatment settings throughout the county. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 39 Rev. March 2015FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Trained 356 clinicians from a broad spectrum of Mental Health and SUD programs through 16 multi -agency skill -building trainings, 26 on- site trainings and TA sessions. This included conducting 1 CME training for physicians, training peer facilitators in the PEERS Tobacco Program, and training and TA to implement the 2011 BHCS Tobacco Policies and Consumer Treatment Protocols in both multi -agency training settings and at specific provider sites. Impact includes increase d clinical capacity to intervene with consumers who smoke in settings where clinicians are practicing their clinical skills and where tobacco policies have been, or are being implemented. Project activity also includes providing intensive TA to 5 BHCS tobacco intervention mini- grants designed to improve recipient agencies' competency in intervening with their clients who smoke. Mini -grantees collectively provided interventions to 286 clients in their programs, and continued to strengthen their tobacco poli cies. Collaborative work with PEERS resulted in PEERS providing 21 tobacco education presentations to over 215 consumers in 15 provider programs. Additionally, 172 consumers who were considering quitting smoking attended Tobacco Recovery Groups at 4 provid er sites. ATOD Project provides evaluation analysis to the PEERS Tobacco Program. Provider implementation of 2011 BHCS Tobacco Policies and Consumer Treatment Protocols has been uneven, with significant successes on one end of spectrum, and little or no movement on the other. Most programs are somewhere in the middle in terms of implementation and tobacco treatment. Continued outreach to those under -performing agencies produced some improvement, but disparities still exist. FY 14/15 Progress Report: Conducted 5 skill -building and 14 on -site trainings for a total of 128 participants. This includes training consumer facilitators working in PEERS Tobacco Program. Trainings are scheduled through the end of FY. Broad range impact is similar to FY13- 14. Continuing to provide support to BHCS tobacco intervention mini -grantees. As of 1/31/15, ninety -five (95) clients received tobacco interventions in these programs. IMPACT: Clients of staff we have trained are reporting decreased stigma (\"Now I can be around my children and family\"); increased MH/SUD recovery (Clients speak about how quitting smoking has strengthened their recovery from substances and mental health); improved finances (clients have been able to save for housing, furniture, flat screen TVs and more) and m ore housing opportunities (Section 8 waiting list includes \"no smoking\" for majority of available housing.) Disparity in implementation of Tobacco policies as mentioned in FY13- 14 still exist. Recently met with the BHCS Director to request additional support and assistance from BHCS to overcome these barriers. Mitigation strategies are now in process. OESD 17.

Individual Placement Support / Supported Employment (Alameda County IPS) Program Description: Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services, in conjunction with the California Department of Rehabilitation, has embarked on a long -term plan to implement Individual Placement and Supported Employment (IPS). This evidence- based practice assists adult and transition- age youth consumers with finding and maintaining competitive jobs in the commu nity available to people with and without disabilities. Engagement, job development, placement, and job follow -along supports are the core program elements of this approach. The following key features illustrate some of the essential aspects of Alameda County IPS: 1. No consumer is excluded from program access or participation due to diagnosis, presence of symptoms, substance abuse, housing status, personal presentation, etc. Desire to get a competitive job is the criterion for services, because motivation to work is a strong predictor of success. 2. Upon entry into IPS services, consumers receive direct assistance with making employer contact quickly, usually within 30 days. There are no requirements for vocational testing, work samples, employment groups or other pre- vocational activities. 3. Employment specialists make frequent, in- person employer contact and build employer relationships based on the consumer's preferences in order to make a good job match. 4. Vocational services are individualized to fit the needs and preferences of each consumer. Individualized job search and job follow -along plans reflect each person's unique interests, goals and needs. 5. Competitive jobs are the goal, and transitional and/or sheltered employment is not utilized in Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 43 Rev. March 2015order to avo id delaying progress to achieve competitive employment. 6. Once a consumer obtains a job, the follow -along services are provided continuously until the job is stable or people no longer request services. Employment specialists provide a wide- range of job coaching and job supports to support a person's success. 7. Vocational services are integrated closely with mental health services in order to ensure IPS program success. Employment specialists meet weekly with mental health teams (case managers, personal service coordinators, peer specialists, and/or psychiatrists) to share information, collaborate, and plan services. 8. Ongoing quality improvement efforts focus on building on program and staff strengths to ensure that over time program outcomes for jobs is enhanced. The Supported Employment Fidelity Scale is utilized for quality improvement guidance. These services are available to people with serious mental illness that are part of ACBHCS adult service teams, Full -Service Partnerships, Level 1 specialty providers, and Level 1 Transitional Age Youth (TAY) Programs. FY 12/13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Outcomes : Competitive employment rate percentage, which is the number of clients in the IPS program who worked a competitive job in the community, divided by the total number of people in the IPS program. Benchmarks set by the Dartmouth IPS Collaborative include 30% minimal standard, 40% good standard, and 50% exemplary standard. Data source: Quarterly data forms submitted by Alameda County IPS to the Dartmouth IPS Learning Collaborative; Vocational Services database Notable Community Impact : During this year, Alameda County IPS served 285 consumers, 104 of whom worked competitive jobs, which equals a competitive employment rate of 36%. We secured 88 competitive j ob placements for people, including positions in the administrative, retail, food service, warehouse, transportation, and education sectors. MHSA funds have been leveraged to build capacity and infrastructure for IPS services in adult and transition age youth systems of care. We provided ongoing, intensive consultation and technical assistance to Fred Finch Youth Center STAY program and Bay Area Community Services Case Management team to begin providing IPS services this year. FY 13/14 Progress Report: Outcomes : We served 255 consumers, 100 of whom worked competitive jobs, which equals a competitive employment rate of 39%. Comments on current implementation : One additional employment specialist position was created and filled. Five county clinics have increased their vocational and mental health services integration, which has increased referrals and outcomes from those programs. MHSA funds have been leveraged to build capacity and infrastructure for IPS services in adult and t ransition age youth systems of care. We provided ongoing, intensive consultation and technical assistance to one additional agency to begin providing IPS services this year. The IPS Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 44 Rev. March 2015programs at Fred Finch and BACS had an average competitive employment rate of 35% this year. Individualized benefits counseling has been more widely available for consumers considering work or who have job changes. July 2014 -June 2015 Plans: Alameda County IPS plans to directly assist 260 adult and TAY consumers with obtaining and maintaining competitive jobs that fit their preferences. Planned changes: We plan to increase the integration of vocational staff onto County -run case management teams through shared office space, attendance at weekly team meetings, and increased communication between staff. This area of IPS fidelity has been shown to increase outcomes and improve services. We plan to meet with all contracted mental health programs in Alameda County to assess their readiness to implement IPS and create a project plan. We will start a new IPS pilot at BOSS (Building Opportunities for Self -Suffici ency). We want to streamline and integrate our vocational data collection and reporting. Continue consensus building and marketing activities related to IPS. In October 2014, we plan to host a one- day IPS symposium to highlight success so far and encourage interested agencies to consider implementation. July 2015- June 2016 Plan: Alameda County IPS plans to directly assist 280 adult and TAY consumers with obtaining and maintaining competitive jobs that fit their preferences. Planned changes: Continue to provide technical assistance and leadership for vocational services in Alameda County. Continue to assess program needs and make needed changes. July 2016- June 2017 Plan: Alameda County IPS plans to directly assist 300 adult and TAY consumers with obtaining and maintaining competitive jobs that fit their preferences. Planned changes: Continue to look for opportunities to integrate IPS services into mental health treatment. Assessing system -wide implementation of IPS and determining if additional training resources are necessary. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 45 Rev. March 2015OESD 21. Housing Services Office Program Description: MHSA funds were used to create the Housing Services Office with the following goals in mind for the entire mental health services network and the people it serves: 1. Increase the availability of a range of affordable housing options with appropriate supportive services so that individuals can \"choose\", \"get\", and \"keep\" their preferred type of housing arrangement; 2. Minimize the time individuals spend living in institutional settings by increasing and improving working relationships among housing and service providers, family members, and consumers; 3. Track and monitor the type, quantity, and quality of housing utilized by and available to BHCS target populations; 4. Provid e centralized information and resources related to housing for BHCS consumers, family members, and providers; 5. Coordinate educational and training programs around housing and related services issues for consumers, family members, and providers; 6.

For current FY 13 -14 Progress Report: Activities have include d: Education and training for providers and consumers Supporting the development of new affordable housing units with designated housing opportunities for individuals with serious mental health issues and unstable housing Management of a financial housing assistance fund to help BHCS consumers obtain and/or maintain housing Management of a network of emergency housing resources for BHCS consumers Management/oversight of the Alameda County Housing CHOICES website and housing news for the system: www.achousingchoices.org Management/oversight of partnership arrangements with the Housing Authority of the County of Alameda (HACA) and Alameda County Housing and Community Development (HCD) to expand affordable housing resources for BHCS consumers Education, support, and advocate related to community living facilities - shared living facilities for BHCS consumers, e.g., room and boards, board and cares, etc. For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15-16, FY16 -17 Plans: More coordinated management of resources to support community living facilities including licensed board and care homes. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 46 Rev. March 2015A. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SU PPORTS PROGRAM SUMMARIES OESD 22. Wellness Centers Program Description: The Wellness Centers are designed as an exit strategy for participants who are on intensive case management teams and full se rvice partnerships in Alameda County as they develop their wellness and recovery plans and link with natural and community supports. The main program goals are focused on helping individuals cr eate a fuller life in the community without the need of more intensive mental health services. Each individual is supported in developing their own recovery goals for wellness and community living. The monthly team meetings focus on the participant's successes in achieving progress in the 8 domains of wellness in their life. This is reviewed in these meetings together with a Case Manager, a Peer Counselor, an Employment Coordinator, a Psychiatrist and any one in the participant's community who can help them to achieve their goals that are developed ou t of the team meeting format. The main interventions are the following: 1. Team meetings, which occur monthly as needed to develop action steps based on needs to help individuals transition from center based supports to community based supports; 2. Classes and Workshops based on the domains of welln ess to assist individ uals in learning the skills necessary to transiti on to community services 3. Employment Services with the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model to assist individuals in attaining gainful employ ment in the jobs of their choice 4. Psychiatric support from a wellness and recovery ori ented psychiatrist to assist the individual's to transition to community based care 5. Support individuals to attain and achieve independe nt living in permanent hous ing places of their choosing. FY 14/15 Progress Report: The Centers have been used as a graduation/step down for consumer s from the Service Teams, FSPs, ACT and CHOICES program: Once someone is stepped down from one of those programs they are a llowed 3 months of utilization of both their referring serv ice provider and t he Wellness Center. After a certain amount of recovery skills are in place, the participant is discharged from the Wellness and Recovery Center and into the co mmunity where they will receive their behavioral health needs through an FQHC primary care clin ic and thus have \"graduated\" from the County mental health syst em of care. As of January 2015 the Centers will open to a wider group of participants. The Wellness and Recovery Centers will be available for usage by any behavior health participant at any Level of Care (Level l, 2, & 3.) Consumers may attend the Centers while they are on a Service Team, an FSP, an ACT or Level II case management program, or any other level of behavioral health care. Consumers may keep their psychiatrist either on their Levell teams or primary care while attending the Centers at the same time. There will be no time restrictions in participating in the Centers Consumers may partake of the services when t hey choose and for as long as they would like to participate. Referrals can come directly from another leve l care or the Centers can accept walk-ins. The Centers will continue to operate a full complement of wellness and recovery skill building Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 47 Rev. March 2015A. COMMUNITY SERVICES & SU PPORTS PROGRAM SUMMARIES tools through groups and one-on- one counseling and other Evi denced Based Practices. The Centers will increase their level of st affing with those who have lived experience, understanding the Wellness and Reco very Centers need a large staf f presence from those who have had mental health st ruggles themselves. The Centers will keep a 90-person case management program open to assist participants who are severely and persistently mentally ill and are in need of short term targeted case management services to help stabilize their life. The Centers will employee both a psychiatrist and nursing staff who will offer medication support services. Consumers can receive psychiatry services ei ther through the Wellness and Recovery Center case management program or thr ough a medication only service, The Centers will be increasing their hours to prov ide some limited service on Saturdays and/or Sundays. After January 1st 2015 a quarterly utilization revi ew meeting to determine who is attending the Centers from case management programs and whether both services are needed or the consumer can receive their services solely from the Wellness Centers will begin. BACS will engage the provider in the review and make an assessment for the consumer that they are jointly serving in order that a dialogue and/ or disposition plan can occur. FY 15/16 Plans: The overarching goal of redesigning the service utilization is to increase participation in the Centers by opening the Centers to a broader group of consumers. The Wellness and Recovery Centers under the new model will act as a touchstone for Alameda County Behavioral Health consumers and for those unknown to the behav ior health system of care. The new model will serve as a community that is driven and determined by the participants needs, and serve as a community where our consumers are welcomed to attend and partake in recovery skill building regardless of where they are at with their own recovery. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 48 Rev. March 2015 Alameda County has implemented a variety of Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) programs for the purpose of \"preventing mental illness from becoming severe and disabling and improving timely access for underserved populations.\" 1 It's the intention of all PEI programs to emphasize strategies for the goal of reducing negative outcomes that may result from untreated mental illness: suicide, incarcerations, school failure or dropout, une mployment, prolonged suffering, homelessness, and removal of childr en from their homes. California's historic commitment to prevention and early intervention through Prop 63 moves the mental health system towards a \"help- first\" instead of a \"fail first\" strategy. PEI identifies individuals at risk of or indicating early signs of mental illness or emotional disturbance and links them to treatment and other resources. 2 Alameda County's PEI programs create partnerships with schools, justice systems, primary care and a wide range of social services and community groups . In addition to these partnerships, the county has also placed these preventative and early intervention services in convenient places where people go for other routine activities. The MHSA specifies that all funded PEI Programs must include: Outreach to fam ilies, employers, primary care health care providers, and others to recognize the early signs of potentially severe and disabling mental illness ; Access and linkage to medically necessary care...as early in the onset of these conditions as practicable ; Reduction in stigma and discrimination associated with either being diagnosed with a mental illness or seeking mental health services and reduction in discrimination against people with mental illness (MHSA, Section 4, Welfare and Institutions Code (WIC) \u00a7 5840(b)). 1 Proposition 63: Mental Health Services Act 2004 2 MHSOAC PEI Fact Sheet, December 2012 Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 49 Rev. March 2015MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTATION PROGRAMS PEI 1.A School -based Mental Health Consultation in Preschool Currently the funds for this program are being used as part of the match funding for a SAMHSA grant to develop a system of care for the 0- 5 community. This program is called Early Connections , an Initiative to strengthen services and supports for children 0- 5 and their families. For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Family Partner Integration Strategy Outcome Statements : Increased family engagement through the utilization of Family Partners Increased family knowledge regarding community resources Improved child social/emotional functioning Increased family leadership skills Impact: 110 young children and their families were served by Family Partners in FY 12/13 Family Partners provided services in English, Spanish, Chinese and Vietnamese. In FY 12- 13 Early Connections developed and implemented training and infrastructure for Family Partners in the early childhood mental health agencies. Training was provided to both Family Partners and the mental health staff at each of the agencies. Family Partners are parents with lived experience, having used services and supports for Parent Caf\u00e9 Peer to Peer Support Group Strategy Outcome Statements : Increased confidence in parenting skills Increased access to community resources Increased family leadership skills Impact: In FY 13- 14 (2) Parent Caf\u00e9 6 week sessions were held. Each session was conducted in three languages - English, Spanish and Chinese. Parent Caf\u00e9 served 50 parents in Parent Caf\u00e9 sessions. Parent Caf\u00e9 is informed by the Strengthening Families framework that integrates five strengt h-based protective factors that are essential for prevention and early intervention. The factors are: Parental Resilience, Social Connections, Knowledge of Parenting and Child Development Concrete Support in Times of Need Social and Emotional Early Connections is currently developing sustainability plans for FY 15- 16 and 16- 17. So the below numbers are estimates based on current data and initial fiscal planning. Family Partner Integration Strategy FY 14 -15: 130 young Peer Support FY FY 14 -15: 30 families FY 15 -16: 30 families FY 16/17: 30 families Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 50 Rev. March 2015their own children. Challenges : Hiring challenges at each of the early childhood mental health agencies. Each agency needed to develop job specifications and dedicate time to outreach and engage qualified individuals. Understanding of role of Family Partner. Isolation for Family Partners as sole practitioner on team of mental health staff. Strategies to mitigate: Hiring: Technical assi stance to and increased partnership with early childhood agency directors. Role and Isolation: Increased training and technical assistance for mental health staff. Ongoing monthly Family Partner/early childhood mental health agencies Learning Community. Competence of Children (www.strengtheningfamilies.net ) Family Partner Integration Strategy In FY 2013- 2014 Early Connections increased the number of Family Partners employed in early childhood mental health agencies from 7 to 12 Family Partners. Impact: It is projected that 100- 110 young children and their families will be served by Family Partners in FY 13- 14. Early Connections will continue to develop and sustain Family Partner services in early childhood mental health programs over the next three years. Early Connections is developing a Family Partner Integration Tool Kit that will provide the community with written protocol and training to develop and sustain Family Partners. Early Connections will continue to develop and sustain Co-Learning projects and training. Similar to Family Partner Integration Tool Kit, Early Connections is developing a Co-Learning Readiness and Fidelity Protocol for community use and implementation of Co -Learning. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 51 Rev. March 2015PEI 1. B/C School -based Mental Health Consultation Programs Program Description: School -Based Mental Health (SBMH) consultation currently serves 16 out of the 18 Alameda County school districts, and provides a variety of consultation services including: Child Specific Consultation; General Consultation; Trainings/Workshops; Transition Planning; Service Coordination, and Supports. SBMH Consultation Services must: involve building the capacity of schools to address the social, emotional, and behavioral learning needs of students; promote a school climate that identifies and addresses student mental health needs and is supportive of students at risk for serious mental health issues; develop collaborative partnerships with teachers, staff, parents, and other providers to create school environments that promote healthy, social emotional development; help make social -emotional learning supports available to all students; and facilitate effective problem -solving among adults and students. For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Our overall vision is that all youth are socially and emotionally healthy and graduate college and career ready. Outcome Statements : Youth and families have an increased access and utilization of mental health consultation services. Youth report improved social emotional functioning as a result of ment al health consultation services Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: This program produced: 7,607 consultation services for a total of 26,648 contacts, which is a 9% increase from FY 11/12. These numbers above are indicative that the education community, including families, are interested in and see the need for these consultation services- which increases access for those who utilize the services. For FY 13/14 the County, in partnership with the Alameda County School Districts, has developed an evaluation framework and has started a data collection process to determine a number of identified results including: 1) children are physically, socially and emotionally healthy; 2) children succeed academically; 3) environments are safe supportive and stable; 4) families a re supported and supportive and 5) Systems are integrated and care is coordinated and equitable. As data is gathered analyzed more information will be shared. No planned changes Projected people served: FY 14/15: 8,000 children, youth and families FY 15/16: 8,500 children, youth and families FY 16/17: 9,000 children youth and families Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 52 Rev. March 2015 Another example of impact was the implementation of a 6 week parenting education class for Spanish speaking parents whose children attend school in San Lorenzo Unified. Parent participation was incredibly high and parents reported learning a great deal about community resources and parenting skills that they otherwise wouldn't have learned or understood. Challenges: There were minor challenges for this year including: more need and requests for services than staff could address, uneven support from the school district around mental health consultation, and the turnover in staff which led to the need to re-educate on the concept and benefits of mental health consultation services. PEI 2. Early I ntervention for the Onset of First Psychosis & SMI among TAY Program Description: The PREP (Prevention and Recovery in Early Psychosis) Program was originally funded by a BHCS contract in early 2010 to identify and intervene with transition age youth (16-24 years) experiencing an initial episode of psychosis associated with schizophrenia and their families. The PREP Program provides the best in evidence- based treatment and support for youth and families through an intensive outpatient model of care that includes the provision of: algorithm - based medication management, cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp), individual placement and support (IPS), assertive outreach, multi -family groups, cognitive remediation and strength -based care management services. For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 53 Rev. March 2015Outcome Statement s: The PREP Program will reduce consumer hospitalizations The PREP Program will reduce the number of prescribed antipsychotics Impact : Hospitalization : During FY12 - 13, PREP collected hospital admission data from INSYST and compared the number of admissions for each active client prior to enrolling in PREP and the number of admissions each client had during their time in PREP. The total number of hospital admissions decreased by 76%; from 133 hospital admissions in the year prior to admission to just 32 during the course of enrollment . Antipsychotics : During FY1 2- 13, Examining the prescription records kept by the medical team we identified that they were able to significantly reduce the number of antipsychotic medications taken by consumers. The number of consumers not taking any antipsychotic medication increased by 6% and the average number of antipsychotic medications taken by consumers decreased by almost 66%. Challenge s: During FY12- 13 the length of stay at hospitals was not measured, so though we saw fewer hospital admissions, several of these resulted in long hospital stays For FY 13 -14 the PREP program is collecting hospital admission and length of stay for all consumers to better report how PREP reduces the burden on the psychiatric crisis system of care in Alameda County. A WR AP group for consumers and families will provide additional wellness and recovery tools to promote wellness and help identify as well as address potential crisis situations before hospitalization is necessary while leading to shorter stabilization time when hospitalization is unavoidable . PREP has made changes to the data collection practices to gather more detailed information for both hospitalization and medicat ion management. In addition, they are also collecting IPS data for education and employment. Through these improved data collection efforts PREP hopes to better report on these v ery important areas and provide a more detailed picture of the outcomes for PREP graduates. Although there have been some periods of staff turnover, PREP has been full y staffed for much of this fiscal year and plan to serve 60 active TAY consumers during FY 13/14. PREP will continue to provide services to transition age youth living in Alameda County focused on intervening early with evidence- based practices, culturally competent assessment and thorough assessed diagnosis . Projected people served: FY 14/15: 75 TAY, FY 85 TAY Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 54 Rev. March 2015Similarly with medication, in FY 12-13 medication dosage was not analyzed. The new medication management system for FY13- 14 captures dosage, lab work and several health indicators which will provide a clearer picture of the balance bet ween the effective dose and any side -effects The PREP Program is currently serving 58 consumers and PREP has served 66 consumers over the current fiscal year. The program capacity is 60 and it is contracted to provide service to 55 -60 consumers at any given time. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 55 Rev. March 2015PEI 3.A Mental Health -Primary C are Integration for Latino Older Adults Program Description: Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center (TVHC) as a Federally Qualified Health Center has been implementing the IMPACT model since fiscal year 2011/2012.

Challenges: Primary care staff turnover, Medical Director inconsistency and recruiting for qualified bi - lingual/bi -cultural staff. Space concerns. PEI program now fully staffed and engaged in screening and assessment activities. PEI 3.B Mental Health -Primary Care Integration for API Older Adults Program Description: Asian Health Services (AHS) as a Federally Qualified Health Center has been implementing the IMPACT model since fiscal year 2011/2012. In fiscal year 2012/2013 AHS screened (using the PHQ -9 4 ) 453 clients, 102 clients were screened positive and 15 clients agreed to be referred to or given a \"\"warn handoff\" by the Primary Care Provider to the Behavioral Health Specialist.

Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: 453 Challenges: Lost productivity during staff transition months; short staffed in PC; lag time in stepped care. Overall Client Outcomes include: 1.Reduce or eliminate the symptoms of depression; 2.Lower the risk for suicide; 3.Improve physical health; and 4. Reduce functional disability. PEI 3.C Mental Health -Primary Care Integration for Older Adults at ERs ( Geriatric Assessment and Response Team ( GART ) Program For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, increase enrollment by 50%; GART clients will meet over 50% of treatment goals upon discharge; Over 50% of clients will be linked to support servi ces upon discharge from GART. Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: Over 164 contacts with older adults; 21 met criteria were enrolled in the GART Program. FY 13/14 Activities By the end of FY 13/14 : GART will hire a 1.0 FTE RN-II position and, 1.0 FTE MHS -III position to increase consistency of service delivery; Increase client enrollment by 50%; maintain treatment goals; maintain FY discharge. Planed changes: In FY 14/15 GART will be fully staffed trained in OA services. Projected people served: FY 14/15: 44 Older Adults (59+) FY 69 Older Adults (59+) Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 58 Rev. March 2015Of the clients served in FY 12/13: Over 70% met treatment goals upon discharge. Over 70% were linked to support services upon discharge. GART expanded its geographic boundaries beyond \"Central County\" to address community needs county -wide. GART had over 40 outreach activities throughout the County including attending \"Health Fairs\" and other community events. Challenges : Loss of staff has created some challenges for staff to provide services throughout the County All GART services are provided in the field. GART clinicians are required to \"reserve\" a County Car when transporting staff. This takes away from client contact; recommending \"purchasing\" GART car to promote improved effi ciency. Over 80% of clients' will be satisfied with GART services. (GART evaluations) Curren t Evaluation Responses include: \"Amazing Resource\" \"I like the Program because my therapist met with me at my home\" \"Staff were very helpful and to be commended for their hard work\" Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 59 Rev. March 2015PEI 4. Stigma and Discrimination Reduction Campaign Program Description: The Alameda County Social Inclusion Campaign's goal is to create welcoming communities by promoting inclusion and eliminating mental health stigma and discrimination. The campaign is run by the consumer led organization Peers Envisioning and Engaging in Recovery Services (PEERS). For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15 -16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements: Reduce stigma and discrimination through the direct contact method. Community Impact Research suggests that having contact with people who openly talk about their mental health condition and recovery is the best way to end stigma. To help empower more consumers of mental health to talk about their experiences and provide this contact, PEER S trained a 30 member speaker's bureau, which provided trainings and speeches to 3,089 people in the general public of Alameda County. In addition to the general public special efforts were made to reach members of targeted groups. Unique messages and s peakers were utilized to help reduce stigma in these targeted groups: 675 family members , 393 people who hold the power to change housing policies and practices , and 1,491 individuals from the African American community . PEERS also produced and aired 4 Mental Health Matters educational videos for the goal of reducing stigma and increasing awareness of mental health issues. In FY 13/14 the program focused on building capacity within the special populations they have been working with so that they can cont inue to address stigma and discrimination within their own community independently . The expansion of Wellness Recovery Action Planning (WRAP) is one example of this capacity expansion. WRAP is a tool that helps consumers of mental health services overcome internal stigma and creates non-stigmatizing supportive environments within a community. To help create sustainable stigma reduction and community and individual empowerment, PEERS trained 12 African American community leaders and 12 people in the Housing Industry as certified WRAP facilitators. These individuals will then be equipped to continuously offer WRAP as a resource and continue the fight against stigma and discrimination within their communities, independent of PEERS. No Planned Changes Projec ted people served: FY efforts FY countywide through various efforts Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 60 Rev. March 2015UNDERSERVED ETHNIC LANGUAGE POPULATION (UELP) PROGRAMS The UELP programs were designed to provide services to historically underserved populations, which the State defined as: Afghan/South Asian, Asian/Pacific Islander (API), Native American, and Latino. Each UELP program is built on a foundation of three core strategies: 1) Education and Outreach, 2) Mental Health Consultation and 3) Early Intervention services. These strategies are implemented through a variety of services such as one- to-one outreach events, psycho- educational workshops/classes, consultation sessions, support groups, traditional healing workshops, radio/television/ blogging activities, and short term -low intensity early intervention counseling sessions for individuals and families who are experiencing early signs and symptoms of a mental health challenge or mental illness . In FY 12/13 the data show that these UELP providers in total produced: 4,943 prevention events, which is a 14% increase; 33,101 people were served at these prevention events; (duplicated count) and 751 unique clients were served through early intervention services, which is 28% more than the previous year of 585 clients. Alameda County Behavioral Health Care Services is currently working with all of the UELP programs to finalize a simple outcome- based survey that will be fully implemented in FY 14/15 in 11 languages: English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Chinese, Dari, Hindi, Khmer, Nepali, Korean, Thai, and Burmese. Domains that the survey will cover include: C onnecting individuals and families with their culture; F orming and strengthening identity; C hanging knowledge and perception of mental health; B uilding community and wellness, and Improving access to services and resources. In addition to identifying progress and success through the above survey domains the county has also started to analyze early intervention data to determine if access has increased for these historically underserved populations. A preliminary round of data analysis does seem to indicate that access to mental health services has increased. BHCS looked at \"access\" in two ways: 1) Of the people receiving early intervention services, what percent had received services in our system with in the past three years and 2) O f the people receiving early intervention services what percent went on to need mental health treatment services. For our first question BHCS took a cohort of 598 early intervention clients from FY 12/13 and looked back three years to see if this cohort had ever been served in our system before. The data found that only 15% of t hese 598 clients had ever been seen before in our system. Reasons for not accessing services in the past are still being investigated; however the data does show an increase in access for a significant number of clients in this cohort. For the second question BHCS took a cohort of 619 early intervention clients from FY 11/12 and looked forward to see what percent went on to need mental health treatment services. The data found that 31% of the 619 clients went on to receive mental health treatment services (mainly outpatient services) in FY 12/13. This data indicates that the majority of early intervention clients who are experiencing early signs and symptoms of a mental health challenge or mental illness are being Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 61 Rev. March 2015able to receive the appropriate level of care from a cultural lens that they are familiar with; and that for those needing a higher level of care they're being referred for this care. More information will be shared on this indicator of access as data is available and analyzed. PEI 5. Outreach, Education and Consultation for the Latino Communities Program Description : The UELP program that serves the Latino community is led by the agency la Clinica de La Raza and is called \"Cultura y Bienestar\". It's designed to serve Latinos throughout Alameda County by providing services through a four agency collaborative with each agency leveraging its knowledge and trust in their region to provide services to Latinos in their region of Alameda County. La Cl\u00ednica de La Raza serves the northern region, La Familia Counseling Service serves the central region, Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center serves the southern county region and East Bay Youth and Family Initiatives serves the east county region. More information on this program can be found at http://culturaybienestar.com For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15-16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements Youth and families have an increased access and utilization of culturally specific prevention and early intervention services Participants will report increases in social emotional wellness and cultural connections . Participants will report an increased understanding on where to seek support/help in crisis situations. Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: This program produced: 2, 137 prevention events (200% increase); 14,623 people were served at these prevention events; (duplicated count) and 399 unique clients were served through early intervention services, which is a 35% Community PEI Educators continue to help reduce stigma by interchanging the terminolog y of mental health with emotional well -being, allowing for a more receptive message to be communicated. The emphasis is on promoting a state of well -being, recognizing disequilibrium, and providing tools and resources for establishing emotional well - being, physical health, and supportive, healthy relationships in one's life. This program has also helped to normalize mental health issues by pointing out its prevalence and the availability and efficacy of treatment. Individuals are having a better under standing of what constitutes mental health and how to recognize the signs associated with mental health conditions. No planned changes Projected people served: FY 14/15: 2,250 1,463 children and TAY, older adult s FY 15/16: 2,275 1,489 children and TAY 786 adults & older adults FY 16/17: 2,300 1495 children & TAY 805 adults & older adults Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 62 Rev. March 2015increase from FY 11/12. These numbers are indicative of the Latino community recognizing the value of this program as consultants for prevention services, CBO trainings, traditional healing, and community development. Another example of impact is through utilization of media in the form of a monthly radio show on Radio 1010 to discuss mental health topics allowing a question and answer segment that allows callers to receive an immediate consultation and referral for mental health services if needed. This type of format allowed for the discussion of cultural norms and traditions that lay at the foundation for the expression of grief, depression, anxiety, loss, immigration, unemployment, and trauma in the Latino community. Challenges: One challenge the prog ram has faced involves access for children and youth during the school year. This challenge was mitigated by providing services during recesses or after school times. In Hayward, the program worked closely with the Hayward Unified School District which provided program staff with access to students during normal school hours. Access to youth is also facilitated by their close relationships with the Union City, Newark, Oaklan d, and Fremont School Districts. The program has also Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 63 Rev. March 2015encountered challenges reaching LGBTQQ I youth. To remedy this, they conducted outreach at local LGBTQQI events and successfully established ongoing relationships with members of these groups. PEI 6. Outreach, Education and Consultation for the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) Communities Program Description: The UELP program that serves the Asian/Pacific Islander (API) Communities is led by two agencies, Asian Community Mental Health (ACMHS) and Community Health for Asian Americans (CHAA) and is called \"API Connections\". It's designed to serve a diverse range of unserved and underserved API communities through the provision of culturally responsive mental health promotion/prevention and early intervention services. More information on API Connections can be found at http://www.chaaweb.org/programs/apiconnections and http://acmhs.org For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15-16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements Youth and families have an increased access and utilization of culturally specific prevention and early intervention services Participants will report increases in social emotional wellness and cultural connections. Participants will report an increased understanding on where to seek support/help in crisis situations. Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: This program produced: 1,936 prevention events ( 25% Community PEI Wellness Educators continue to help reduce stigma by interchanging the terminology of mental health with personal joy and well-being, allowing for a more receptive message to be communicated. Currently API Connections is engaged in a number of activities including: Network ing with Alameda County's Pool of Consumer Champions Asian subcommittee to encourage more community members with lived experience of recovery to become trained as mentors and speakers Start ed a new support group No planned changes Projected people served: FY 14/15: 2,250 1,463 children and adults FY 15/16: 2,275 1,489 children and TAY 786 adults & older adults FY 16/17: 2,300 1,495 children & TAY 805 adults & older adults Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 64 Rev. March 2015increase ); 9,410 people were served at these prevention events; (duplicated count) and 183 unique clients were served through early intervention services, which is a 32% increase from FY 11/12. Within the many API communities there is an incredibly high degree of stigma regarding mental health. These numbers above are indicative of services that are culturally responsive and as such people have been interested and open to attend ing events and utilizing these PEI services. Among the many API communities a number of approaches have assisted in opening dialog about mental health and reducing stigma. Some of these approaches include: taking an ethnic group' s world view approach and embedding it into conversations; speaking in their native language; organizing support groups that include non- threatening activities and engaging people in their daily routi nes, out in the community (not at clinic sites) to make discussions about mental health and resources less threatening. Community friendly Bi -lingual resource brochures were also developed in English, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Khmer. Challenges: Several external challenges for K orean -speaking mothers who have children or youth with mental illness Launched a Cambodian elementary school students' after school wellness program in Oakland to address and prevent the prevalence of youth gang violence among Cambodian neighborhoods In the process of d eveloping social groups for the Mongolian community focused on physical activity, single women, and parenting. Creation of a support group for Pacific Islander families of prisoners, former ly incarcerated individuals and their allies to better support this population in the community. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 65 Rev. March 2015were faced in the past year including new leadership at the executive level, implementation of electronic health records, staff unionizing and family deaths. Staff were able to overcome these challenges through re- focusing on c lients and hosting a half day retreat. Other programmatic challenges included tracking and timely submission of Medi -cal Administrative Activities. Additional time and training has been dedicated to this so that in FY 13/14 this will not be as challenging . PEI 7. Outreach, Education and Consultation for the South Asian/Afghan Communities Program Description: The UELP programs that serve the South Asian and Afghan Communities are run by two prominent community -based agencies, the Portia Bell Hume Center and the Afghan Coalition. Both of these agencies work collaboratively in providing services to these underserved populations. Examples of their activities include (but are not limited to): home visits, gender specific support groups, psycho- educational workshops and presentations, mental health consultations, healing practices that address issues of trauma, low -intensity early intervention visits and other cultural celebrations. More information on this program can be found at http://www.humecenter.org and http://www.afghancoalition.org For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements Youth and families have an increased access and utilization of culturally specific prevention and early intervention services Participants will report increases in social emotional wellness and cultural connections. Participants will report an increased understanding on The community mental health specialists continue to outreach and engage the various South Asian communities in order to reduce stigma and discrimin ation. One agency has presented at three different conferences addressing mental wellness among the South Asian community. Conferences include: Healing and Resiliency, Spirituality and No planned changes Projected people served: FY 14/15: 850 442 children and TAY, 408 adults & older adults FY 15/16: 875 455 children and TAY 420 adults & older adults FY 16/17: 900 468 children & TAY Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 66 Rev. March 2015where to seek support/help in crisis situations. Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: This program produced: 810 prevention events ( 40% increase); 8,565 people were served at these prevention events; (duplicated count) and 128 unique clients were served through early intervention services, which is a 100 % increase from FY 11/12. Within the many South Asian communities there is an incredibly high degree of stigma regarding mental health. These numbers above are indicative of services that are culturally responsive and as such , people have been interested and open to attending events and utilizing these PEI services. Among the many South Asian communities a number of approaches have helped facilitate dialog and conversations about mental health and reducing stigma. Some of these approaches include: developing \"non- psychological jargon\" for outreach and engagement, conducting activities in native languages such as Hindi, Punjabi, Dari, Farsi, Urdu, Pashto and Tamil, and providing opportunities for engagement and services out in the community, e.g. at resource fairs, local temples, a youth soccer club, schools, community centers, etc. An additional example of a successful outreach and Wellness Conference with a focus on Asian Sikh, Hindu, Buddhist, and Islamic Communities, and Women and Trauma Training. Additionally, this same team participated in a radio talk show through a South Asian Radio Show to address mental health illness and early detection. Another goal for FY 13/14 is to increase print m edia outreach to the Afghan community by having a monthly article on mental health in the Afghan Examiner. There are also goals to partner with existing agencies and schools in the southern part of Alameda County to continue to develop relationships and leverage resources for these communities. 432 adults & older adults Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 67 Rev. March 2015engagement strategy was the use of a \"wheel of questions\" at various community events. The purpose of the wheel is to engage participants to interact with a mental health specialist in a fun and nonthreatening way to address or highlight healthy coping mechanisms when dealing with stress or a challenging life event. Challenges: As with many of the UELP programs the challenge of overcoming mental health stigma and engaging communities is always present. These programs have been able to mitigate this challenge through not using labels or jargon and introducing services as a way to cope with everyday challenges and normalizing clients' experiences. There has also been staff turnover in one of the programs, which created delayed timelines in implementing a media outreach campaign and lack of continuity at one school site. However these positions have been filled and the program appears to be back on track to meet their annual deliverables. PEI 8. Outreach, Education and Consultation for the Native American Communities Program Description: The UELP program that serves the Native American Communities is led by the community organization the Native American Health Center (NAHC). This PEI program run by the NAHC is called Spirit, Art & Culture, Guidance and Encouragement (SAGE) Center. To date this program, has been very successful in providing culturally appropriate mental health promotion/prevention and early intervention services to the Native American community. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 68 Rev. March 2015For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 upc oming FY 14 -15, FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements Youth and families have an increased access and utilization of culturally specific prevention and early intervention services Participants will report increases in social emotional wellness and cultural connections. Participants will report an increased understanding on where to seek support/help in crisis situations. Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: This program produced: 60 prevention events; 503 people were served at these prevention events; (duplicated count) and 41 unique clients were served through early intervention services. The SAGE Center has had a number of impactful projects during this time period including: 1) The introduction of Living By the \"Ceremonial Calendar\". Native American ceremonies are fundamental to human growth, development and connec tion to the community. The SAGE Center has conducted three initiation ceremonies during FY 12/13: Manhood Ceremony, Sun Dance Ceremony, and the Womanhood Ceremony. 2) In May 2013 the SAGE Center held their annual Sage Gathering and Wrapping for their community. This provides access for the Native The PEI Natural Helpers continue to help reduce stigma by interchanging the terminology of mental health with the idea of \"being out of balance\". This culturally relevant/responsive interpretation of the conc ept of mental health/illness allows for a more receptive message to be communicated. Staff at the SAGE Center are also involved at the State level though the California Reducing Disparities Initiative, e.g. staff and Native family members were featured in the film \"A Different State of Mind \", which was aired on PBS in July 2013. The film showed the use of \"ceremony \", as a collective approach to recover y from imbalance opposed to the individual approach common in western practices. No planned changes Projected people served: FY 14/15: 850 442 children and TAY, 408 adults & older adults FY 15/16: 875 455 children and TAY 420 adults & older adults FY 16/17: 900 468 children & TAY 432 adults & older adults Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 69 Rev.

It provides the N ative community with a way to heal from Historical Trauma an d at the same time strengthen others by giving back with the preparation and use of traditional medicine. Over 1000 sage bundles were created at this event. Challenges: As with many of the UELP programs the challenge of overcoming mental health stigma and engaging communities is always present. This program has been able to mitigate this challenge through using the term historical trauma (HT, which both empowers the community and reduces stigma as it's a term that takes into consideration the context of Native experiences in response to federal policies. Historical trauma responses (HTR) is a constellation of features including substance abuse, suicidal thoughts, low self - esteem, bursts of anger, difficulty with relationships, unresolved grief, mood regulation. All new hires to Native American Health Center learn about HT and HTR as part of their new employee orientation. The SAGE Center conducts on average 2-3 of these trainings a month for staff and the community . Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 70 Rev. March 2015PEI 9. Mental Health - Primary Care Integration Program Description: Build behavioral health capacity in primary care clinics with Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) delivering primary care in the County. The project uses the AIMS model, provides training to FQHCs and incentives to encourage those clinics to develop behavioral health positions. FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Despite staffing changes during FY 13/14, BHCS has been able to increase the level of participation by all of the Community Health Centers in the Integrated Behavioral Health Program. BHCS staff working on the integration projects with the Community Clinics are now attend the monthly Alameda Health Consortiums' Behavioral Health Clinicians meeting as well as trainings. This is a new level of collaboration between Safety Net health care providers and behavioral health staff which will benefit all Alameda County residents. FY 14/15 Progress Report: All of the Alameda Health Consortium's Community Health Centers (including Alameda Health System) are actively participating in the Integrated Behavioral Health Program that focuses on the recruitment and retention of licensed Behavioral Health Clinicians and participation in the Pay for Performance's five measures of patient treatment progress. The Consortium Health Centers are now have two more quarters left on their BHCS Integration contracts, and are working with staff to identify new performance measures that will improve patient behavioral health treatment outcomes and strengthen their ability to serve Alameda County residents with behavioral health concerns. FY 15/16 Plans: BHCS implemented the county -operated Psychiatric Consultation Service in al l 8 of Alameda County CBO Community Health Centers. All of the Community Health Centers have expressed that this new service has been of tremendous value to their primary care providers in their treatment of clients with behavioral health concerns as well as improved their ability to prescribe psychotropic medications. BHCS is currently meeting with the Alameda Health Consortium Leadership to discuss renewal of this service as well identify ways new ways to work as a team in the primary care clinic setting that improve quality of care and patient services. PEI 12. Trauma Informed Care/Suicide Prevention Program Description: Crisis Support Services of Alameda County (CSS) is a nonprofit, volunteer - based crisis intervention and suicide prevention agency. They provide a variety of mental health services to a wide range of persons in varying degrees of crisis. Their primary miss ion is to assist people in emotional distress, to offer supportive counseling to those in crisis and to prevent suicide. CSS is leading the way for suicide prevention centers across the nation in providing sensitive and timely services to people impacted by traumatic stress. Trauma -Informed C are (TIC) is a person- centered response that focuses on improving functioning over curing mental illness (or \"fixing\" something \"broken\"). It recognizes that people are more than their labels and diagnoses and those relationships are a common context for traumatic events, and that healing most often occurs in the context of relationships. CSS utilizes a wide range of TIC components and responses when working with all of their clients, but predominantly with those affected by traumatic loss, particularly sui cide and homicide bereavement.

Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: The Teens for Life (TFL) Youth Suicide Prevention program In FY 13/14 all of the suicide prevention programs and trauma informed care strategies are going strong. See the comments below from several of the programs to better understand the impact these programs are having: Student Comment from the Teens for Life Youth Suicide Prevention Program : \"I used to think that learning about suicide wouldn't be very helpful, that common sense would kick in. I now know that isn't the case and I feel prepared to help anyone who may feel depressed or suicidal\". 14 year -old Youth Comment from the Crisis Text Line: One texter chose to save the tri -fold text line card given out during a TFL presentation for a future time: \" you guys came and visited my health class in like the beginning of the year...handed out little pamphlets and I kept one in my sock drawer next to my blade. The other day, after being clean for 4 months, I went to go and cut, but saw the number, and yeah, texted and my wrists are still healed :)\" Based on the data from the crisis phone line and text line No planned changes Projected people served: FY 14/15: 13,700 12,800 children and older adults FY 15/16: 13,800 12,850 children and TAY 950 adults & older adults FY 16/17: 13,900 12,900 children & TAY 1,000 adults & older adults Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 72 Rev.

The group and individual counseling program served 72 adults for a total of 735 sessions and 262 students for a total of 2,803 sessions -all through the lens of being trauma informed and for many individuals addressing the traumatic issue within the counseling sessions. Community Education & Consul tation Trainings served 822 adults through 36 trainings. Post training 88% strongly agreed or agreed with this statement \" I feel confident in my ability to ask directly about suicide.\" Challenges: these are the areas where youth are struggling the most: Suicidal desire (feeling hopeless) Anxiety Self harm Relationship issues Bullying LGBTQ coming out struggles CSS has also developed a number of new collaborations in FY 13/14 including a partnership with the Oakland Police Department (OPD). OPD provides Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) for law enforcement and CSS was asked to participate as a trainer on Suicide Assessment & Intervention. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 73 Rev. March 2015Access to teachers and parents in school systems are still a challenge. This has been mitigated somewhat through collaboration with the PEI funded school district mental health liaisons, but remains an ongoing challenge to be addressed each school year. PEI 12. Family Education Resource Center Program Description: The Family Education and Resource Center (FERC) is a program of the Mental Health Association of Alameda County. It's a family/caregiver centered program that provides education, advocacy, support and hope to families and caregivers of a love d one with a mental health challenge. For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming FY 14 -15,FY 15- 16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements : Family Leadership : Increase leadership and advocacy skills for family members through the Family Leadership Program (FLP). Public Education: Future mental health providers will increase their knowledge of consumer and family member perspectives around mental health and mental health challenges through in- class Public Education Training (PET) Program . Impact Clients Served FY 12/13: 2,168 individuals were served through the FERC during this fiscal year. In FY 13/14 the FLP has continued its efforts and has all 5 members sitting on committees or workgroups to represent the family voice and share the family perspective. It's the goal of this program to grow the number of family leaders from 5 to 10 in the upcoming fiscal year. The FERC would also like to support these family leaders in being able to tell their story on various public speaking panels so as to raise awareness of the family voice/perspective. The Public Education Training Campaign has been incredibly successful with 83% of participants strongly agreeing that they expected to use some of the information that they learned during the training. No planned changes Projected people served: FY Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 74 Rev.

Asian Pacific Islander staffing to ACCESS Program Description: Improve availability of ACCESS information and referral; and brief treatment service s by increasing bicultural staff in one Asian Pacific Islander crisis clinic. Services include phone referrals, assessment, outreach and brief crisis stabilization treatment. FY 13/14 Progress Report: (n=172) Adult 53.74% (n=1,193) Older Adult (60 and over) 13.92% (n=309). For Short Term Crisis Stabilization program, there was an increase of 65 years and older clients being served. They accounted for 11% of open cases during the year of 2013. Largest age group was 45- 65 years old and they accounted for about 50% of clients served. Clients who were younger than 34 years old accounted for 23%. Examples of notable impacts in the community: We reached out to general population, LGBT communities and faith communities. We provided psycho- education presentation and organized Wellness/Safety & Health events. We also collaborated with Chinese speaking NAMI group. In order to expand geographic areas for outreach, two of the outreaches were held in Fremont. We also provided psycho- education to professionals and providers to increase awareness and sensitivities to address mental health treatment needs for API population (Sausal Creek and County ACCESS staff) There are countless examples of individual cases that without Asian ACCESS, they would never be served. One of the examples is a mute, Mien speaking gentleman. Since he arrived to this country two decades ago, he had been virtually living in the backyard storage unit for most of his adult life while manifesting psychotic symptoms. With outreach and psycho- education to the family , client is now receiving mental health treatment, and be linked to other social services. We often find that once we establish a connection with a client, we start to see more family members who need mental health and social services. As we are able to provide various supportive services within the same agency, it makes coordinated care much more streamlined. Challenges and barriers: General stigma about and lack of knowledge of mental health treatment among Asians continue to be a challenge. We have been addressing this by engaging public in various settings to provide psycho- education. We note that once the clients find our assistanc e helpful, the stigma about receiving mental health services was reduced. They or their family and friends are more likely to approach us for services. For example we receive calls from former youth Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 78 Rev. March 2015client who now request services for themselves as adults . We also received calls from former clients referring their family or friends. Systemic issues: health care system changes make it very difficult for monolingual clients to access services. We will continue to address issues at county level to advocate for the APIC community. We will also help link clients to services if they have language barriers. We continue to provide integrated health care to our ACCESS clients through the SAMHSA grant. We felt more impacts of Health Care change. Many clients called in or walked in to ask about changes from HealthPAC to MediCal. They could not get through Alameda Alliance and called 1-800-491-9099 listed on their card, which was Alameda County ACCESS number, as such routed to our Asian ACCESS referral line when they pressed \"3\" for Asian languages. When moderate -severe requirements/ screening tool for specialty mental health services was introduced, we felt our clients were unfairly impacted. We were advised to screen caller over the phone, and do not proceed to fac e to face screening unless they meet moderate- severe criteria over the phone. However, most callers are not able to articulate their symptoms or treatment needs due to stigma, nor will they volunteer personal and family issues right away to some strangers on the phone. In addition, callers tend to undermine problems and are not familiar with mental illness. With screening question on whether callers have any past psychiatric treatment history, the \"no\" answer may not reflect correctly their service needs. Callers may not have received any treatment in the past due to the non- existence or non- utilization of psychiatric services in their home country. Therefore, the screening tool may present false negative outcomes, preventing them from being accurately assessed for their symptoms, thus treatment recommendations. For this reason, we believe that face to face assessment is crucial for proper assessment and determination of level of care for most immigrant Asian populations. Mild-Moderate Condition Clients. Related to previous point, the clients who were screened and determined to be functioning at mild- moderate range were referred out to PCP or their health plan mental health providers. However, monolingual Asian clients face tremendous difficulties in obtai ning mental health services. First, they have difficulty navigating the automated phone system to talk to a live person and request someone to communicate in their native language. Then they were given phone numbers of providers who do not speak their language, and/or not accepting new clients, requiring them to go through step 1 again. Third, even if they are assigned to providers, most likely they are English speaking providers working with them through translators. Many clients expressed dissatisfaction to continue services under such arrangements. Some of the clients who are lost in the system called us for help, but we need to turn them down because they do not meet the severity level for specialty mental health services. Such system creates unfair barrier to our API monolingual clients as they will most likely give up seeking further help during the process, contributing further the low penetration rate for API group. Impact of Covered California Plan. Many clients obtained Covered California health insurance plan and as such can no longer receive county's specialty mental health services. When they try to use mental health services under their insurance, however, many face similar problems as stated above. During FY 13/14, psychotic disorders -related intake calls were at 19.83% as compared to 5.12 % of County ACCESS statistics. This confirms that Asian Americans tend to under -utilize services, and when they do seek services, symptoms tend to be very severe. Continue to outreach clients in the community by doing home visits assessments and providing consultation to families. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 79 Rev. March 2015PEI 16. Latino staffing to ACCESS Program Description: Improve availability of ACCESS and brief treatment clinic/field based services by increasing bicultural staff in one Latino crisis clinic. Includes assessment, brief treatment and referral services. FY 13/14 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges: Performed screening, assessment and referrals for Spanish speaking Latinos 5 days per week. Hoped to transition program for primarily appointment based to open access to allow for greater access to services but this did not occur. Continue to offer appointment based assessments with accommodations for those in crisis that need to be seen immediately. Provided brief treatment/crisis stabilization services to 163 clients. Performed 402 Assessments to provide level of care determination Providing 4 Spanish groups per week including WRAP, Peer Activity, Depression and Trauma facilitated weekly by Peer staff or Peer & Clinical staff together for outreach/engagement and symptom monitoring. FY 14/15 Progress Report: Perform screening, assessment and referrals for Spanish speaking Latinos 4 half days per week. Researched and learned that a drop in assessment model (open access) is best supported by use of collaborative documentation. FY 14- 15 setting up rooms for collaborative documentation initiative and all Access/Assessment staff have been trained and are starting to use collaborative documentation with client input. Once collaborative documentation is achieved, our program plans to transition assessment program for primarily to program where clients can select between scheduled appointment and walk -in assessments to allow for greater access to services for FY 15-16. In FY 14- 15 Continue to offer appointment based assessments with accommodations for those in crisis t hat need to be seen immediately.

Transition Age Youth (TAY) Youth Centers Program Description: The TAY Wellness program at Youth Uprising (YU) consists of a team of 2 full time mental health clinicians, a mental health intake intern and Health and Wellness Director. Under the MHSA Wellness contract, these clinicians provide individual, family and group counseling services to TAY ages 13- 24, prioritizing uninsured TAY between the ages of 16- 24. In addition to counseling services the Wellness Team supports TAY around basic needs including housing, food and shelter in order to minimize barriers to therapy engagement associated with these needs. The YU Wellness Program employs innovative approaches to build relationships and offer mental health services packaged as mentoring, arts, recreation, education and simply meeting basic needs. This approach to service delivery has resulted in a broad definition of \"client\" and \"engaged\" which allows Wellness services to be delivered to TAY who may not be ready to engage in traditional weekly therapy services. For previous FY 12 -13 For current FY 13 -14 For upcoming F Y 14 -15, FY 15-16, FY16- 17 Outcome Statements: Increase the diversity of TAY clients receiving clinical services with a particular focus on LGBTQ youth and youth of color. Reduce stigm a associated with mental illness. Improve the integration of physical and mental well - Current programmatic Strengths and Activi ties: Triple C: \"Cool Calm to \"Anger Management\".

Of which, 123 cl ients (50%) identified as female, 122 as male and 1 as transgender. 73% identified ad African American , 20% Latino and 7% other. In terms of age 5% were between the ages 13- 15, 20% between 16-17, 43% between 18-21 and 24% between ages 22- 24. TAY Wellness staff worked to increase YU as a welcoming place for the LGBTQ youth consumers through: hosting a Coming Out Party; starting a Queers and Allies (Q&A) standing committee, and adopting a bathroom policy in support of Trans identified members, clients and visitors. TAY Wellness staff have also worked to reduce mental health stigma through the provision of internal trainings for YU staff to reduce discrimination and biases that may be implicitly operating around mental health challenges. Additionally the YU Wellness Team has worked to improve the integration of physical and mental well -being of TAY through the assistance of enrollment in healthcare/health insurance. Assistance included scheduling appointments, attending enrollment (WRAP ) group: In collaboration with the agency PEERS, YU began hosting and offering a WRAP group in January 2014. Six TAY have engaged in this service and are working on their individual plans to reduce personal crisis and maintain/ improve t heir level of functioning . Mental Health Intake Clinician- Intern. This is a relatively new position on the Wellness T eam. This position was added to increase efficiency with referral triage and reducing wait times between referral for service and service contact. The curr ent intern is a YU alumni, who' s currently in a psy chology doctorate program. She' s bilingual and has increased YU's capacity to engage monolingual Spanish speaking parents. Current Challenges Staff v acancy: TAY Wellness program is currently understaffed due to a clinician departure in December 2013. The vacancy has been posted. Interviews were conducted and an offer was made to a qualified candidate in February, After some delay, that candidate declined the offer of employment. They're still searching for a qualified clinician, with priority of adding Spanish language capacity to the Wellness T eam. Group referrals: Youth counseling groups rarely reach full capacity. YU is in discussion with multiple 250 prevention/ wellness classes 45 counseling services Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 82 Rev.

Challenges : One priority in FY12- 13 was to support TAY with health care enrollment to facilitate engagement in physical health care services. Despite increased on- site support from the Medi -Cal office and ability to submit HealthPAC applications, there remained challenges in completing health care applications. TAY between ages of 18- 24 posed unique challenges of address instability, difficulty proving income and household size, and challenges producing necessary documents to complete the application. potential partners to increase the number of referrals sources external to YU programming in order to implement more group programming.

Behavioral Health Medical Home Program Description: Provide BHCS consumers with serious mental illness with access to integrated primary health care services in two Alameda County Mental Health Community Support Centers. FY 12/13 Outcomes, Impact & Challenges In Fiscal Year 12/13, the PATH Project exceeded its enrollment goal of 250 program participants at the Oakland and Tri -City Fremont Adult Community Support Centers. The Fremont Tri -City PATH Clinic opened on August 8, 2012, and by March, 2013, the PATH Project had enrolled 261 program participants at the Oakland and Tri -City Community Su pport Centers. The PATH Project amended the primary care partners BHCS contracts to include onetime funds for dental care services not covered by Medi -Cal. Each PATH site received $15,000 to $20,000 in SAMHSA Grant \"Carryover\" funding to cover dental procedures beyond basic examinations and cleanings authorized by the State of California Dental -Cal Program. Wellness activities at both sites also were able to start classes on nutritional cooking, medical education, and stress reduction, and walking groups. Peer run support groups also met at the Oakland PATH site to explore how to implement the \"Community Connections Program\". At the end of the fiscal year, program participants were setting \"Healthy Living\" goals and close to 50% of the enrolled PATH c lients participated in at least one well class or activity. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 83 Rev. March 2015The Oakland PATH Project completed the first year of the State of California, External Quality Review Organization's Performance Improvement Project (EQRO). The EQRO Team visited the Oakland PATH site on November 8, 2012, and was very impressed with the progress made by the PATH Project staff on the collection of health data and with the high level of satisfaction among the program's participants. An analysis of clients enrolled for a year or more showed significant health improvements were made in lowering metabolic indicators for those with high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and high cholesterol (See PIP PATH Data Presentation and PATH Metabolic Indicators Attachments). On February 7 and 8, 2013, the BHCS PATH Project sponsored the Winter SAMHSA PBHCI Western Regional Conference at the Oakland Airport Hilton Hotel. The conference had over 93 attendees from PBHCI Grantee Programs from the States of Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Utah, Arizona, and California. On Friday, February 8, 2013, Ms. Kathy Reynolds, Vice President Health Integration and Wellness Promotion Services spoke to BHCS Executive Leadership, managers, and directors of primary care, behavioral health, and substance abuse organizations on \"How to implement and sustain Integrated Health Services within the Behavioral and Primary Care Health Settings\". Over 30 behavioral health program leaders and managers were able to be in attendance for the presentation. On August, 2013, the PATH Project was able to fill its Registered Nurse and Mental Health Specialist positions at the Oakland Community Support Center as well as start its fourth half day clinic on Friday morning on December 6, 2013. FY 13/14 Program Outcomes to Date and Plans: During FY2013/2014, the PATH Project entered its fourth year, and has been able to increase its participant enrollment to over 280 consumers enrolled at the Oakland and Tri -City Adult Community Support Centers with a participant retention rate over 80%. In February, 2014, the BHCS Decision Support Services and the PATH Project Program Evaluator looked at LifeLong Medical Care's health data for Level I Clients in the PATH Project and Level I Clients not enrolled in a behavioral health integrated primary care service. The results showed that PATH participants not only had more successful access to primary care services, but also over a 12 month period had higher improvement rates for their blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI) and blood sugar level. The PATH P roject's Sustainability Workgroup completed a written PATH Project Sustainability Plan in March, 2014, which was approved by Alameda County's SAMHSA, Primary Behavioral Health Care Integration Project Officer. The Sustainability Plan described the activities used by BHCS to create collaborative partnerships with the PATH Primary Care provider organizations, the necessary financial model to cover the costs of the services, and the collection of data that shows the positive impact of the services. On May 12, 2014, the PATH Project received approval from BHCS Executive Leadership to start exploring the possibility to implement a PATH Project model at the Eden Adult Community Support Center in San Leandro, California. Eden Community Support Center has approximately 325 enrolled Level I program participants. On May 22, 2014, the Oakland PATH Project sponsored its second Annual \"Visioning Retreat\" to discuss the project's progress, set new goals, and discuss how the integrated care program has had an impact on Level I consumers participating in the primary care services and health and wellness classes and activities. The retreat was attended by 35 case managers, primary care providers, psychiatrists, peer support counselors, nurses, and program evaluation staff. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 84 Rev. March 2015Starting in the last quarter of FY 13/14, the PATH Project has been collaborating with three of the BHCS Adult Community Support Center Directors to have discussion meetings with the BHCS, Substance Abuse Administrator and his program staff on how to improve access to substance abuse treatment services for SMI consumers enrolled in the community support centers and full service partnerships. FY 14/15 Program Plans: Implement the PATH Project at Eden Adult Community Support Center by February, 2015, and operate two half day primary care clinics at the site by June 30, 2015, with at 95 enrolled program participants. Using the PATH Project's integration model, implement a half time primary care service in collaboration with Ti burcio Vasquez Health Center at the BHCS Gail Steel Wellness and Recovery Center in Hayward, California by May 25, 2015. Working in collaboration with the BHCS Substance Abuse Administration staff, identify at least two ways that SMI consumers served by BHCS community support centers and full service partnerships can have improved access to substance abuse treatment and recovery services available in Alameda County. Work with the Alameda Health Consortium to develop ways to get access to the physical health information on SMI consumers ser ved by their network of community health centers so that the PATH Project can better monitor the impact of integrated care on emergency room utilization, hospitalizations (psychiatric and medical), and criminal justice contacts. FY 15/16 Program Plans: Work collaboratively with the BHCS Information System Office to make sure that the new Electronic Health Record System can be utilized by the behavioral and primary care staff that is a part of the PATH Project to share health information on program partici pants. Monitor PATH Project staff to ensure that they are billing Medi -Cal for the client services at the BHCS, adult community support centers. Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 85 Rev.

The Conference included grantee workshops, a plenary speaker on innovations in mental health services, and multi- media presentations of the projects. 250 providers, County staff, school representatives, consumers, family members, and other community members participated in the conference. Challenge: The first round of INN grant funding was awarded based on a learning question posed by the grant ee, coupled with their innovative approach designed to answer that question. Though the grants were all quite worthy, Behavioral Health Care Services (BHCS) and the MHSA Ongoing Alameda County MHSA FY14+ Plan Update P. 90 Rev. March 2015Planning Council (OPC) learned from this initia l process that our funding criteria were too broad. These overly -broad criteria resulted in an overwhelming number of proposals, many of which did not help us address issues facing our system of care. This was a valuable learning experience for BHCS . Round Two Innovation Grant Projects (INN 2) Innovative pilot projects were in implementation from Apr il 2012 to December 2013. For the second round of INN funding, BHCS, with input from the MHSA Ongoing Planning Council formulated the learning questions and the desired outcomes to address issues rose in the African American Utilization Report . BHCS' intention was to improve the quality of care and more positive mental health outcomes for the African American clients and consumers . Alameda County has historically served African Americans for behavioral health issues at a disproportionately higher rate than other members of our community, yet the outcomes are inconsistent. In late 2009, BHCS leadership commissioned a study to address and explore t he various issues affecting behavioral health care services in Alameda County within the African American community. The process was led by a local facilitation team, working with the BHCS Ethnic Services Manager/Cultural Competency Coordinator and a 29- member committee. Input was solicited from a full spectrum of community stakeholders and subject matter experts regarding ways to resolve these disparities and deliver more effective, culturally appropriate care. The African American Utilization Report contains the Committee's findings and recommendations and serves as the foundation for the Innovations Grants, Round Two Learning Questions. BHCS' overarching goal is to decrease African American utilization of more restrictive and often involuntary levels of care by providing and engaging African Americans in more culturally responsive services that result in improved client/consumer outcomes and reduced disparities. BHCS identified as priorities those recommendations that would have the greatest impact on our system and spanned all four systems of care. BHCS created the learning questions to address four critical needs: 1. Developing culturally responsive practices; 2. Strengthening BHCS partnership with the faith- based community; 3. Supporting trauma informed care that recognizes the trauma related to social issues within the African American community ; 4. Engaging African American males in their primary and behavioral health care. In April 2012, fifteen grantees were selected to implement the second round of Innovativ e (INN 2) Projects to address these needs . At the completion of the 18 month implementation period, INN 2 grantees would submit one of the following project outcomes: 1. An age- based, culturally -informed provider training curriculum designed to improve effect iveness of behavioral health care services to African American clients/consumers and their f amilies; 2. A program design that includes a set of specific strategies for the development of an effective partnership between the African American faith- based and spiritual communities. T hese communities will serve as cultural institutions and a natural support for BHCS clients/consumers and their families ; 3. An age- based provider training curriculum designed to increase BHCS capacity and expertise on trauma informed care for BHCS African American clients/consumers and families; 4. A set of specific strategies, supports and recommendations that will improve the engagement of African American adult males in behavioral health and primary care services.

March 2015ATTACHMENT A: PUBLIC COMMENT & RESPONSES NOTE: Only \"substantive comments\" -- defined as comments or requests for changes that would significantly alter the target population, design or budget of one or more programs - are shown and responded to. Other comments are available upon request. 1 FSP 10 - African Amer ican Full Service Partnership Public Comment Response Does \"Multi -disciplinary team\" mean that there will only be one provider for all Alameda County African American TAY and Adult Male consumers? One provider at $500,000? If the intent is to fund only one provider, Alameda County has done this in the past (e.g. funded only one or two programs and they have not been as effective) . The services mentioned above could be achieved through case managers and peer counselors and a half time or less program assistant for handle data reporting. A team lead/program manager at 25% FTE would also be sufficient. When the funds are smaller and more equitably distributed among providers there is more of an incentive to collaborate to lever age resources and also keep the overall African American Full Service Partnership goals in the missi on driven vision of BHCS. Recommend funding four (4) FSP at $125,000 each and see how they do in leveraging those funds to meet the needs of the consumer s they would be contracted to fund. You would at least increase the likelihood of more streamlined, client -centered strategies and an incentive to the providers to carefully plan their services for strategic impact during ramp up. The African American co mmunity is very heterogeneous. You could get more bang for the people's buck by funding four providers all the same and each one bring a component of the array of services you are seeking. The number of providers will be based on the responses to the Request For Proposals (RFP). The majority of our current Full Service Partnerships are implemented by one provider or two providers in partnership. $500,000 is for the start -up year while $1M will be the ongoing annual budget. The current design of Full Servic e Partnerships requires a wide array of services and resources that is normally available only to a larger scale program with more staff employed to serve a higher number of clients. However, BHCS will examine different approaches in the design and development phase of this program. My primary question centers on what input did the African American community fulfill in influencing this process? The concept of this program was based on service statistics that show African American males as the largest group receiving services in our most restrictive settings which include locked psychiatric facilities and criminal justice settings. As this plan on ly represents the budgeting of funding for this program, BHCS will engage the African American Steering Committee to provide input on the final design of the program. Since most FSPs serve a large percentage of African American consumers, it would benefit our System of Care to have some of the funds be dedicated to the training and resources needed for current FSPs to include culturally responsive practices that are not already included in the current FSPs. This strategy addresses cultural responsiveness of a single new FSP but does not address the further development of culturally responsive practices in the existing FSPs. Funds for the training of current FSP staff will be budgeted separate from this program. ATTACHMENT A: PUBLIC COMMENT & RESPONSES NOTE: Only \"substantive comments\" -- defined as comments or requests for changes that would significantly alter the target population, design or budget of one or more programs - are shown and responded to. Other comments are available upon request. 2 Female consumers are also in great need. Please provide at least 20% of the designated resources to African American Transition Age Youth and Adult female consumers, who are often mothers, care- givers, silently struggling with depression and other mental health struggles. African American women, chi ldren and families will be served in 1.B - PEI 20. OESD 23 - Community -Based, Voluntary Crisis Services Public Comment Response People would rather go to service providers in their neighborhoods. As a consumer I strongly support this initiative. I want service providers for this initiative to be African American for the African American communities. I want the care providers of this initiative to be Black agencies with Black staff who knowledgeable about Black psychology as a science and who are grounded in the science of Black psychology. I want the coordination and efforts of the initiative designers to be with the Association of Black Psychologists. Cultural competence in serving all clients of crisis services, including African Americans, will be an important consideration in the design and development of these programs. At the appropriate phase, providers and associations with this expertise may be consulted to ensure such competencies are reflected in the final program requirements and scope of ser vices. Expand Sausal Creek - or locate other services in south county. There is limited crisis response and it is in Oakland. There is a need for an active car in South County: increase for cars for Crisis R esponse programs both north and south county; I suggest incorporating a car for each: GART, Tri- valley, Tri- cities and unincorporated areas. When someone needs help - if they do need to end up going to John George involuntarily - that person has to be transported - is there room on the John George campus - another building? - that could serve as a diversion from needing to wait until some- one needs to be 5150'd - a voluntary facility on the John George campus for crisis service expans ion. We need more room for people who need the involuntary facilities - do not diminish the facility for involuntary while expanding the voluntary. Each of these suggestions will be reviewed in the crisis planning process.

Other comments are available upon request. 3 PEI 12 - Suicide Prev ention & Trauma Informed Care Public Comment Response It is not clear how additional MET funding is a focus on suicide prevention. The vast majority of MET calls are not for suicidal ideation /plan/intent, but for co- occurring MH and SUD conditions related to homelessness and behaviors that warrant police attention. Might these funds be better served through continued training of law enforcement regarding psychiatric conditions and how to intervene in strength based and empath etic manner? MET funding is listed under PEI 12 because the MET Team responds to individuals in psychiatric crisis, inclu ding suicidal ideation, in order to provide the appropriate assessment and level of care through a clinician and officer team. In ad dition to the MET funding, BHCS is in its fourth year of providing funding for Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) for all Alameda County law enforcement departments and dispatch units. CIT is comprised of 18 modules including a consumer and family member panel and a cultural diversity module, both of which are strengths based and aim to increase officers knowledge and empathy. So this is a direct contract with CSS, not out for bid? Yes, this is an expansion of an existing contract. PEI 15 - ACCESS for API Population; PEI 16 - ACCESS for Latino Population Public Comment Response I applaud many of the programs in terms of trying to get some of the gaps, there hadn't really been a prevention program that gears more to a cultural approach to the African- American population, there hadn't been a lot of geographic diversity so I'm glad to see some of those. I know there's been a lot of work by a lot people to come with these programs, I don't see any that don't have tremendous value in to address the gap that's not taking away this issue about what are the outcomes. The reason I'm here t oday to ask in preparation of the next plan. When we started this program with MHSA, the Latinos were served at \u00bd the rate of the general population Asian/API of 1/3 of rate we put a lot of MHSA money in programs out there and that disparity still there to day, I don't see a single program that is really addressing getting at that disparity and it probably take a planning process as there was one for the African- American prevention program, my request for today is not a criticism of many of these programs I truly don't know the Over the next three year period, the accumulated unspent MHSA funds are projected to be exhausted; all existing programs are being reassessed and evaluated for their relevance and effectiveness. Under this review, some programs may be expanded if the program effectiveness matches the community need. ATTACHMENT A: PUBLIC COMMENT & RESPONSES NOTE: Only \"substantive comments\" -- defined as comments or requests for changes that would significantly alter the target population, design or budget of one or more programs - are shown and responded to. Other comments are available upon request. 4 depths of any of these they sound like they do address some of the gaps but in terms of these gaps serving Latino population and the Asian/API they've been underserved for a long time, there's been a lot of change in the programs but i t doesn't really change the disparity my request for today is we will have another plan update my hope for BHCS is that we can start to talk together as a community about what can we do we know that specifically design program really can infuse in populati on that are necessarily so trusting these big partnership that supposed to serve everybody we know that there are population continue to be underserved that are not specifically design from a more cultural or linguistic place. I think we are addressing som e of the gaps and in particular geography I really pleased to see that East county is getting more services and also I know there's a group working on African- American Prevention Strategy. I think we put a lot of programs out there but still disparity for Latinos and API community is not changing. We need some very specific program to address this. PEI 18 - Behavioral Health Medical Home Public Comment Response Half of the Adult Service Teams are county operated and half are CBO operated. This funding should be used to build primary care clinics at CBO Service Team sites since prior MHSA funding was already used to build primary care clinics at BHCS operated site of Oakland CCS. There is already a dispar ity in the system of care and this strategy seems to further divide the system. There are many CBO Service Team sites that would be able to build primary care availability on site in partnership with an FQHC with this level of funding. It is suggested that these funds be targeted to Service Teams that focus on serving BHCS's most underserved target populations (Latinos, Asians) which no other strategy addresses like geography which is addressed in the next strategy Our long term goal is to integrate primar y care with as many of our service teams as possible future funding permitting.

Other comments are available upon request. 5 PEI 20 - Culturally -Responsive Programs f or African American Community Public Comment Response The funding level for such a large percentage of community members is not sufficient. At least $500,000 to $750,000 more is far more equitable considering how similar programs have been funded for other cultural communities over the last five years or so. With an investment of an additional $750,000 taken from some of the other higher funded projects, you could essentially fund 10 projects at $125,000 and truly start to build stronger collaboration among African American cultural providers. The problem of competition for scarce resources would be eliminated as equity would require all programs to fit their models to a $125,000 budget. And, again, over time they can strategically strengthen their programs and services rather than trying to do too much with more money than is needed to meet the people where they are at. Alameda County has had a long tradition of competitive contracting vs. collaborative and that funding allocation formula may work for traditional mental health programs but it is culturally incongruent to African American cultural values, beliefs and traditions as a communal people. It would be greatly appreciated if BHCS wo uld encourage embedding those cultural values throughout its system of care. Collaboration is empowering, competition has fueled the fragmented systems that have plagued African Americans in Alameda County for a very long time. Incentives for collaboration among the funded providers would also be a powerful system transformation consideration. Incentives in the form of ability to attend the annual cultural competence trainings support to develop evaluation or data collection tools and databases unless you would require use of Insyst. Discounts with your printers and desk top publishing companies for creating health promotion materials and special project funds to encourage community members to get involved in the efforts and you could set the parameters of the special projects (e.g. potted cherry tomato plants for disadvantaged African American families who live in public housing but could as a part of self care/homework or whatever strategy designed the families would receive their fresh vegetable pots to grow on the balconies. Children and family support could include assigning chores and parenting the potted garden growing child (or children and assigning chores of using the watering can to water the plants, etc. This helps to develop a focus on grow ing their own food and bringing the family together. Over the next three year period, the accumulated unspent MHSA funds are projected to be exhausted; all existing programs are being reassessed and evaluated for their relevance and effectiveness. Under t his review, some programs may be expanded if the program effectiveness matches the community need. These programmatic ideas can be considered by the African American Steering Committee in their recommendations for program design.

Other comments are available upon request. 6 My first question center s on what input did the African American community fulfill in influencing this process? Secondly, what factors were used to set the allocation limits and range? The goals of Prevention & Early Intervention programs are sufficiently broad to address many o f the recommendation from the African American Utilization Report (2011).
