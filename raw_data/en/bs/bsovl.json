Funded by the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability and the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, the developed protocols provide a straightforward method for evaluating gross energy savings for each of the most common residential and commercial measures and programs offered by ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs in the United States. Using a single measurement and verification protocol to calculate the energy savings from a particular measure or program will increase the credibility of the reported savings. This increased credibility will give electric utilities, their regulators, and other stakeholders a greater level of confidence about reported savings and reduce the risks of using energy efficiency as an electricity resource. Feedback Please provide feedback on any of the protocols below to [ump@nrel.gov](mailto:ump@nrel.gov). In addition, feedback is welcome on the following: - Protocols that need updating - Protocols for new measures or programs - Changes to the format of the protocols - Additional information the protocols should contain. Overview The following provides the fundamentals and background of the protocols below, which are organized by general topics. Commercial [Commercial and Industrial Lighting Evaluation Protocol](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/68558.pdf) (October 2017) [Commercial and Industrial Lighting Controls Air Protocol](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/77820.pdf) (January and Power Evaluation Protocol](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/68579.pdf) (October 2017) [Strategic Energy Management (SEM) Evaluation Protocol](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/68316.pdf) (May 2017) Residential [Smart Thermostat Evaluation Protocol](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/86175.pdf) (June 2023) [Residential Behavior Protocol](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy21osti/77435.pdf) (October 2020) [Residential Furnaces and Boilers Evaluation (September 2017) [Residential Lighting Protocol](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy17osti/68562.pdf) (October 2017) [Refrigerator Evaluation (September 2017) Combined Commercial and Residential Cross-Cutting These crosscutting topics are referenced in measure-specific protocols and are not efficiency measures. These supplemental discussions help extend the measure-specific method for determination of savings to evaluating whole programs.
