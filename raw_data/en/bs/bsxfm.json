Next Article Holistic Dentistry Can Help Reverse Cavities Going to the dentist is a chore that almost no one looks forward to; it's painful, expensive, and no matter what, you'll probably be told you're not flossing enough. Some dentists might tell you that your issues are a matter of genetics, but that's probably not true. This led one dentist to the realization that the intrinsic problem is not a matter of legacy, but instead a matter of diet, realizing a way to reverse cavities simply by adjusting what one eats. How to Get Rid of Cavities We all know processed sugar and sweets are prime contributors to cavities, but there are also vitamins and nutrients that, when deficient in our diet, can lead to tooth decay. Calcium and Vitamin D are two of these nutrients we know are responsible for strong bones and healthy teeth.
