These headaches would occur several times a month, and always early in the morning while I slept. I was convinced that I was the only person on earth with these weird headaches. In July 2006, a friend gave me a newspaper article about a chiropractor in Durham, Dr. David Leidich, who treats people with headaches. I was skeptical but at the time desperate for help, as the headaches had begun to affect my work. I had my first appointment in mid August and began the treatment program then and there. This is now the end of October 2006, and to date I have only had one mild headache and that was shortly after starting treatment. From time to time I can sense a headache trying to come on, but it never materializes. I am so very grateful to Dr. Leidich and his wonderful staff for their time and patience with me. I would gladly refer anyone having headaches and not getting relief, to see Dr. Leidich at Chiropractic & Wellness Center. I am living proof that the treatment works. This has been a great success for me. Steven C. Relief from Discomfort I am very grateful for the care Dr. Leidich has given me for the relief of pain and much discomfort with my neck and lower back. His staff, Angel, Alicia and Lettie are very kind, thoughtful and caring when I started treatment in July 2006, I was having much discomfort with pain and muscle tightness in my neck and lower back. This was causing much nerve irritation and inflammation. I had a reversal in my neck curve, my pelvis was unbalanced which was causing me to shift much of my weight to one side. I had a number of injuries in my younger years of which I did not seek medical attention. I am 63 years old and I have degenerative disc and joint disease. Words cannot express how much better I feel, the discomfort and pain in my neck is gone. My back still give me some stiffness at times due to the work that I am doing but with an exercise which I do, it had made life more manageable. Currently I am being seen my Dr. Leidich monthly to evaluate my progress and to make any necessary adjustment which will continue advancing my health and well being. God has blessed me with the best chiropractor who cares so much to help your condition become completely well if not more manageable so that you can continue to enjoy your life without the many discomforts we suffer due to pain. The end results will be worth you giving Dr. Leidich, whose years of knowledge and experience with the spine and joints, will give you the best possible treatment for your condition. We need more Doctors like him. My Sincere thanks to you and your staff. Carol B. Thank you Dr. Leidich and Staff How do I condense what I want to express into a small space? Here goes: I was encouraged by my daughter to visit a chiropractor in the local area after she was cured of headaches after visiting one in Charlotte. Being the skeptic that I am, I was sure this wasn't going to work. I'd had headaches my whole life. Sinus infections were a daily battle. The head of the ENT clinic at UNC-Chapel Hill said that I was one of eight patients that he couldn't cure, but I still endured 4 sinus surgeries over a number of year! Sinus infections and headaches were going to be a way of life. Constant backaches and neck muscle tension were where I really wanted help. \"Old Age\" was creeping up fast, but luckily I found Dr. Leidich's office. After consultation and x-rays, Dr. Leidich started my treatment. Dr. Leidich found the spot where I was having headaches and after one treatment I've never had a headache in that area again. The treatments on my neck and back completely relax me and have re-newed by doubtful spirit. Even though arthritis has affected the disks in my back and neck, the cushioned areas between my vertebrae have started opening up. My neck will move and rotate more freely and even my sinuses opening up and feeling much better! The most important thing I want to express is the genuine spirit of Dr. Leidich and his staff. He listens, which is very important, and after 11 years of treating patients he has abilities that you will want in a practitioner. Please don't hesitate to call Dr. Leidich office. He is a man with true conviction and has my recommendation! A. H. C. Allergy Relief I had heard from a couple different sources that chiropractic treatment could be used to treat allergies. I had been taking prescription allergy medicine for years. My worst symptom was uncontrollable sneezing from triggers such as dust and pollen. I really didn't like being so reliant on prescription drugs, needing to take them daily with no end in sight. I thought there must be some way to treat the cause instead of the symptoms, so I decided to give chiropractic care a try. After several weeks of treatment I decided to try going off the medicine to see what would happen. That was about 3-4 months ago and I have not taken it since. I still sneeze on occasion, but nothing like before, and I am off the medication! Not to mention how much better my back, shoulders & neck feel. Sincerely, Kathleen W Headache Relief In the summer of 1998, I began suffering from intense headaches which started at the top of my spine and radiated up into my neck and throughout the base and back of my skull Relaxation techniques, analgesics, muscle relaxants and several painful cervical injections provided only temporary relief, so I was referred to Dr. Leidich by a well respected orthopedist. The first adjustment I received provided tremendous relief and I have had no serious headaches since I started chiropractic care. Dr. Leidich is a warm, caring, supportive professional chiropractor. Betty L. Enhancing The Body's Healing For anyone who has any doubts about the incredible benefit of chiropractic, ESPECIALLY treatments by Dr. David Leidich, allow me to tell you a miracle story. Several months ago, my husband came down with a walloping stomach flu. He got the whole dose, from top to bottom! I watched him be sick, then ache all over for about a week. During that time, I came down with similar symptoms, and I almost did not keep my appointment with Dr. Leidich because I felt so awful. Even my hair ached! I went ahead and kept the appointment at his insistence. After the treatment, I went home and just stayed in bed that night. Even Dr. Leidich said he could tell I was coming down with something The next morning, something incredible happened - NOTHING! I woke up and felt FINE! Now you can say anything you want, but I KNOW my avoidance of that flu was due to going to see him. I never came down with that flu. IF THAT ISN'T MIRACULOUS, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS! Susan D. ________________________________________ Help For The Aching Body What made me consider a chiropractor? Several things, not the least of which were the aches and pains I was experiencing. My son, already a patient of Dr. Leidich, suggested that I try the Chiropractic and Wellness Center as, at least, a point of reference for possible treatment. X- Rays revealed that this old lady's spine had fallen into disrepair and was badly in need of a \"tune up\". The first news was really bad - I had to stay off the tennis court for at least 30 days. The next news was that I was going to probably feel worse before things got better. It was actually easier to accept the \"worse before better\" than it was to relegate myself to 30 days of significantly reduced activity After six visits (two weeks), I certainly understood the meaning of \"diminished returns.\" However, during the third week, my whole (body) world turned around. I was suddenly feeling taller, more flexible and just generally better than I had in forever. All of this did require putting my ice maker on max load and my mind into stretch mode, but everything Dr. Leidich has advised me to do does work. Since I am allergic to just about every medication on the market, chiropractic treatment has been a real boon for me. The adjustments and current therapy, along with my in-home exercising, ice and heat treatments, have relieved my problems to the point that I am now back on the tennis court and winning more than I lose. Everyone in Dr. Leidich's office has made this experience one of complete joy for me. I could not have had a more supportive group of people in the bleachers for this \"old athlete's\" trip back to health. Lenni G. More Help For The Aching Body My name is Tonia and I'd like to share my success story. In the year 2003 I worked at a rest home, which later caused a lot of problems with my back. The first time I decided to see a chiropractor I made the mistake of stopping the treatment and continued on working, well of-course the pain became worse, so I began seeing another chiropractor and my problem still did not get any better. The pain that I endured was unbearable for me. At this point there was low back pain and tremendous pain in my left hip which traveled down my leg to my foot, causing my leg to jerk uncontrollably. I then began to see Dr. David Leidich and my feeling of hopelessness and discouragement all changed. Dr. Leidich created a treatment plan for me that I have committed to and the results have certainly been miraculous! I am a person who has degenerative disc disease and had a pinched nerve which is a bad combination. I was able to be helped by Dr. Leidich, he is caring and truly a professional in his field of work. Dr. Leidich thank you so much for giving me hope of being pain-free and I thank God for you and I truly appreciate everything you have done for me. Tonia B. No More Meds When I first met Dr. David Leidich I wondered if he could really help me. I had a hurt in my back for so many years and have been put on so many medications for the pain and each time the pain came back when I quit taking medication. I wanted a fix and not a cover up. So I saw his ad and decided to try it. I couldn't lose because I had not received the help I needed anywhere else in the medical field. I have since been given a new lease on life. I don't have constant back and neck pain as I did before my treatments. I feel like I can do things that I have wanted to do but couldn't because of back pain. My treatments have brought me a long way from where I was and where I am physically and mentally today. I feel like a new person and can't wait until my next treatment after I leave his office. He has been a blessing to me in regards to my pain and feeling of despair for so many years. I really can't tell you how much Dr. Leidich and his staff have meant to me over the last few months. I know that I feel like a much healthier and better person since I have been receiving treatments. Theresa F. June 22, 2006 To Whom it May Concern: This letter is written is support of David Leidich. In my experience, David is a competent, caring professional who pracitices chiropractic medicine. He is mature, bright, and clesarly cares about his patients. He interacts well with people from all walks of life, and has outstanding organizational skills. I have been impressed with David's interpersonal skills, keen intellect and willingness to work with patients to individualize care. I had the unfortunate experience of developing an acute lumbar strain. I personally utilized Dr Leidich's services andwas impressed with the entire process. He is not critical of allopathic medicine and will send a patient to an allopathic or osteopathic physician when needed. His practice is complimentary to traditional allopathic medicine. I am happy to recommend Dr. Leidich to you. He is a fine person and has wonderful personal characteristics. If you wish to discuss this recommendation further, please do not hesitate to contact me. Sincerely, Kathleen J. Clem, MD Chief of Emergency Medicine Duke University Medical Center _______________________________________________________ March 22, 2006 To Whom it May Concern: I am a physician in the area specializing in Sports Medicine. I have utilized Dr. Leidich's services both personally and professionally wit excellent results. I highly recommend him to anyone with musculoskeletal and spinal issues. Professionally, I have referred many patients to Dr. Leidich over the past 3 years. The majority have been positive results. Most patients are reluctant to try alternative care. They wish to utilize other modalities of treatment first, including NSAIDS, muscle relaxants, physical therapy, MRI with epidural steroid injections (ESI's), and pain medication. When these treatment options failed to relieve their symptoms, they wanted to try alternative care like chiropractic or acupuncture prior to considering surgery. Dr. Leidich's treatment plan has shown great success in these patients. They avoided surgery and have had significant improvement in their pain and radicular symptoms. He caters to each individual's needs and provides the necessary care without added costs of supplements or equipment. The patients love him and all have reported a positive, caring experience. Dr Leidich also has the willingness to refer to a physician if he is unable to help his patients. He recognizes when the patient's needs go beyond his abilities. He will refer for medical treatment whether for medication or evaluation for ESI's or surgery. He also encourages chiropractic treatment in conjunction with physical therapy. The well being of the patient is his goal. In conclusion, I would highly recommend the chiropractic services of Dr. David Leidich. Quality care and patient satisfaction are provided at the Chiropractic and Wellness Center in Durham, North Carolina. Sincerely, Michele D. Pescasio, MD Triangle Orthopaedic Associates, P.A. ______________________________________________________ June 20, 2006 Chiropractic and Wellness Center 3510 University Dr University Plaza, Suite A Durham, NC 27707 RE: Dr. David S. Leidich Chiropractic Physician To Whom it May Concern: It is my pleasure to write this letter of recommendation for Dr. David Leidich. I recently sustained an injury to my neck, upper back, shoulder and clavicle, while slalom skiing. I chose Dr. Leidich for care of these injuries. Dr. Leidich is an intelligent and compassionate Chiropractic Physician and seems to truly care about his patients. Within just a few treatment sessions, I had significant relief of pain and increased mobility. This treatment helped tremendously without the need for narcotics or muscle relaxants. As an Emergency Physician with over 13 years of experience, and an Osteopathic Physician with previous training in manipulative medicine, I think we often overlook the importance of physical therapy and manipulative modalities in treating patients with acute injuries and even chronic pain. Based on Dr. Leidich's superb Chiropractic skills and his excellent patient rapport and interpersonal skills, I would like to highly recommend him for the care of any of your patients with acute injury or chronic neck/back pain problems. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me. Sincerely, David Leader, D.O., FACEP Attending Physician, Wake Med Emergency Dept.
