The DA requires an annual review process to ensure that both the City and CPMC are in compliance with their respective obligations and that the specified community benefits are being delivered. The annual review requires that CPMC submit an Annual Compliance Statement to the City no later than 150 days after the end of their fiscal year (currently, the calendar year). The City is then required to post CPMC's statement and receive public comment for 30 days. Following the public comment period, the City publishes a report on whether CPMC is in compliance with the Development Agreement. The Health and Planning Commissions typically hold a joint hearing on CPMC's compliance with 60 days' notice to the public. After the hearing, the Planning and Health Directors will forward their findings onto the independent third party monitor. The monitor will have 30 days to review the findings and evidence of CPMC's compliance with the DA before sending a letter to the Board of Supervisors stating whether or not he or she concurs with the Directors' findings. If the Directors find CPMC not to be in material compliance with the terms of the Development Agreement, they will immediately notify the City Attorney for consideration and pursuit of appropriate action in accordance with Chapter 56 of the Administrative Code and remedies outlined in the Development Agreement. The annual reporting process for both 2019 and 2020 was affected by the ongoing pandemic-related public health emergency. Some required audits to support CPMC's 2019 Annual Compliance statement could not be Memo to Planning and Health Commissions Case No. 2016-004775MCM Hearing Date: December 16, 2021 CPMC Development Agreement tracking 2 completed until late 2020, and the 2019 and 2020 City Reports were published in October and November 2021, respectively. No hearing was held in 2020 for the 2019 reporting period, and this hearing therefore covers both the 2019 and 2020 reporting periods. The City's Annual Report for January 1 - December 31, 2019 indicates that CPMC was in compliance on each of the obligations contained in the DA. The Annual Report for January 1 - December 31, 2020 also indicates that CPMC was in compliance on each of the obligations contained in the DA, with the single exception of the rate increase limitation for one of the City's two health plans for which CPMC is a provider. Some of the community benefit obligations are multi-year commitments and are still in the process of being completed.

Advisor obtained from CPMC the patient details from the period for Medi -Cal and Charity Care patients and performed data analytics on the received data to determine the number of unduplicated Medi -Cal and Charity Care patients. Advisor performed data analy sis on the unduplicated patient listings, starting with raw data extracted from the patient accounting system, to evaluate whether duplicate patients are included in the listings for calendar year 2019 . Advisor selected a random sample of 25 patients from calendar year 2019 and evaluated supporting documentation provided by CPMC that supports CPMC's classification of the patient as a Medi -Cal or Charity Care recipient. Advisor's methodology used in the procedures were consistent with those used in the review of the This assessment summary memo is intended solely for the information and internal use of Sutter Health, and should not be used or relied upon by any other person or entity. periods for calendar years 2009 through 2018. CPMC is subject under the Development Agreement to an \"Unduplicated Patient Commitment\" of 30,446 Unduplicated Patients (as defined.) This amount is not to include utilization attributable to the 5,400 additional \"New Beneficiaries Commitment.\" It is our understanding that CPMC and the City of San Francisco have agreed to an adjustment of 837 unduplicated patients as the number necessary to exclude the utilization of the 5,400 additional Me di-Cal managed care enrollees from the commitment. Based on the procedures performed above, the total unduplicated patient count is 36,284. With the subtraction of the agreed 837 unduplicated patients, the allowable number of unduplicated patients for 2019 is 3 5,447, representing a surplus of 5,001 for 2019 . This net unduplicated patient count developed by CPMC appears reasonable based upon the procedures performed and reflects the number of Medi -Cal and Charity Care patients t reated the period of January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019 at the Van Ness, California, Davies, Pacific and Mission Bernal campuses of CPMC as reflected in the CPMC Patient Accounting records. ********************** Advisor did not make any management decisions, perform any management functions, or assume any management responsibilities.

At your request, we performed an assessment of the processes and internal controls over the recording of \"community benefit\" Category 3 costs, including a reconciliation of incurred costs from the period of January 1st , 2019 to December 31st, 201 9 and whether they meet, at a minimum, the $8,000,000 threshold established by the C ity of San Francisco. The assessment also included an analysis to determine that the sampled expense items and their categories align to community health benefits category guidelines from the City of San Francisco. Our procedures were performed between March 9, 20 20 and April 24, 20 20 included the following: Advisor reviewed the Community Healthcare Program contract to understand the contractual requirements between CPMC and the City of San Francisco. Advisor also reviewed the city guidelines charter to determine what expenses can and should be considered Category 3 expenses as defined in the Catholic Health Association of the United States publication, A Guideline for Planning and Reporting Community Benefits , (CBISA). Advisor obtained the list of expenses from CPMC under the Community Health Benefits expense categories and gained an understanding of the process for recording costs. We evaluated the data for reasonableness through walkthroughs and assessment of written processes of accounting for program funding and costs. Leveraging the list of gross community benefit expenses, reported as $13,572,281, Advisor selected a sample based upon the population of expenses that excluded restricted contributions of $1,781,931 and performed the following procedures: o Selected individual projects, which in summary exceeded $8,000,000. o Obtained transaction detail for each of these individual projects. This letter is intended solely for the information and internal use of Sutter Health, and should not be used or relied upon b y any other person or entity. o Selected 45 random transaction samples across the projects and performed the following procedures: Compared the accuracy and completeness of the costs to the supporting documentation (e.g., accounting data, checks, invoices, etc.). Assessed whether each of these 45 samples were correct Category 3 CBISA expenses. The community health benefits expenses incurred by CPMC appear reasona ble and reflect that at least the minimum amount of USD $8,000,000 was spent on correct community health benefits program as required by the City of San Francisco. ********************** Advisor did not make any management decisions, perform any management functions, or assume any management responsibilities.

Very truly yours, Deloitte & Touche LLP By: Karolyn Woo Principal EXHIBIT C Finance Policy: Supersedes Policy DRAFT POLICY DATE 11/18//28/2015 Effective Date: Area: Finance References: POLICY ON FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE (CHARITY CARE) PURPOSE The purpose of the policy is to provide patients with information on the Financial Assistance (Charity Care) available at Sutter Health hospital facilities and to outline the process for determining eligibility for Financial Assistance. POLICY It is the policy of Sutter Health to provide patients with understandable written information regarding Financial Assistance to provide income-based Financial Assistance (Charity Care) to qualified patients. SCOPE This policy applies to all licensed hospital facilities operated by Sutter Health or an Affiliated Entity (as that term is defined in the bylaws of Sutter Health), and all other hospitals in which Sutter Health and/or an Affiliated Entity has a direct or indirect voting control or equity interest of greater than 50% (hereafter referred to as \"Hospital\" or \"Sutter Health Hospitals\" (as listed in Appendix G). Unless otherwise specified, this policy does not apply to physicians or other medical providers, including emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists, radiologists, hospitalists, pathologists, etc., whose services are not included in a Hospital's bill. This policy does not create an obligation for the Hospital to pay for such physicians' or other medical providers' services. In California, an emergen cy physician who provides emergency services in a hospital is required to provide discounts to uninsured patients or patients with high medical costs who are at or below 350 percent of the federal poverty level. DEFINITIONS Complex/Specialized Services : \"Complex/Specialized Services\" are services that Sutter Health or a Hospital determines are complex and specialized (e.g., transplants, experimental and investigational services) as well as certain elective services that are typically excluded from coverage under health plan coverage agreements (e.g., cosmetic procedures). Federal Poverty Level (FPL) : The \"Federal Poverty Level\" of \"FPL\" is the measure of income level that is published annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is used by Hospitals for determining eligibility for Financial Assistance. Financial Assistance : \"Financial Assistance\" refers to Full Charity Care and High Medical Cost Charity Care (as outlined in section A.1 Eligibility). {00711610 v.14} 14-294 Hospital Services: \"Hospital Services\" are all services that a Hospital is licensed to provide, including emergency and other medically necessary care (excluding Complex/Specialized Services ). Primary Language of Hospital's Service Area : A \"Primary Language of Hospital's Service Area\" is a language used by the lesser of 1,000 people or 5% of the community served by the Hospital based upon the most recent Community Health Needs Assessment performed by Hospital. Uninsured Patient: An \"Uninsured Patient\" is a patient who has no third -party source of payment for any portion of their medical expenses, including without limitation, commercial or other insurance, government sponsored healthcare benefit programs, or third party liability, and includes a patient whose benefits under all potential sources of payment have been exhausted prior to an admission. Insured Patient : An \"Insured Patient\" is a patient who has a third -party source of payment for a portion of their medical expenses, but excludes patients who are covered by Medi-Cal. Patient Responsibility : \"Patient Responsibility\" is the amount that an Insured Patient is responsible to pay out- of-pocket after the patient's third -party coverage has determined the amount of the patient's benefits. PROCEDURES A. ELIGIBILITY 1. Eligibility Criteria: During the application process set forth in sections B and C below, Hospitals shall apply the following eligibility criteria for Financial Assistance: Financial Assistance Category Patient Eligibility Criteria Available Discount FULL CHARITY CARE Patient is an Uninsured Patient with a Family Income (as defined below) at or below 400% of the most recent FPL Full write off of all charges for Hospital Services HIGH MEDICAL COST CHARITY CARE (for Insured Patients) 1. Patient is an Insured Patient with a Family Income (as defined below) at or below 400% of the most recent FPL; and 2. Medical expenses for themselves or their family (incurred at the Hospital or paid to other providers in the past 12 months) exceed 10% of the patient's Family Income. A write off of the Patient Responsibility amount for Hospital Services {00711610 v.14} 14-294 2. Calculating Family Income : To determine a patient's eligibility for Financial Assistance, the Hospital shall first calculate the patient's Family Income, as follows: a) Patient Family: The Patient Family shall be determined as follows: (i) Adult Patients: For patients over 18 years of age, the Patient Family includes their spouse, domestic partner, and dependent children less than 21 years of age, whether living at home or not. (ii) Minor Patients: For patients under 18 years of age, the Patient Family includes their parents, caretaker relatives, and other children less than 21 years of age of the parent(s) or caretaker relatives. b) Proof of Family Income: Patient shall only be required to provide recent pay stubs or tax returns as proof of income. Family Income is annual earnings of all members of the Patient Family from the prior 12 months or prior tax year as shown by the recent pay stubs or income tax returns, less payments made for alimony and child support. Income included in this calculation is every form of income, e.g., salaries and wages, retirement income, near cash government transfers like food stamps, and investment gains. Annual income may be determined by annualizing year- to-date Family Income. Sutter may validate income by using external presumptive eligibility service providers. provided that such service only determines eligibility using only information permitted by this policy. c) Calculating Family Income for Expired Patients: Expired patients, with no surviving spouse, may be deemed to have no income for purposes of calculation of Family Income. Documentation of income is not required for expired patients; however, documentation of estate assets may be required. The surviving spouse of an expired patient may apply for Financial Assistance 3. Calculating Family Income as a Percentage of FPL: After determining Family Income, Hospital shall calculate the Family Income level in comparison to the FPL, expressed as a percentage of the FPL. For example, if the federal poverty level for a family of three is $20,000, and a patient's Family Income is $60,000, the Hospital shall calculate the patient's Fami ly Income to be 300% of the FPL. Hospitals shall use this calculation during the application process to determine whether a patient meets the income criteria for Financial Assistance. 4. Special Circumstance - Benefits Exhausted During Inpatient Stay: When an Insured Patient's third -party coverage pays only a portion of the expected reimbursement for the patient's stay because the patient exhausted their benefits during the stay, the Hospital should collect from the patient the balance of the expected reimbursement that would have been due from the third-party coverage if the benefits were not exhausted. A Hospital shall not pursue from the patient any amount in excess of the amount that would have been due from the third-party coverage if the benefits were not exhausted, plus the patient's share of cost or co -insurance. A patient who exceeded their benefit cap during a stay is eligible to apply for Financial Assistance. If the patient is eligible for Financial Assistance, the Hospital shall write off all charges for services that the Hospital provided after the patient exceeded the benefit cap. 5. Financial Assistance Exclusions/Disqualification: The following are circumstances in which Financial Assistance is not available under this policy: {00711610 v.14} 14-294 a) Uninsured Patient seeks Complex/Specialized Services: Generally, Uninsured Patients who seek Complex/Specialized services (e.g. transplants, experimental or investigational procedures), and seek to receive Financial Assistance for such services, must receive administrative approval from the individual responsible for finance at the Hospital (or designee) prior to the provision of such services in order to be eligible for Financial Assistance. Hospitals shall develop a process for patients to seek prior administrative approval for services that require such approval. Elective services that are normally exclusions from coverage under health plan coverage agreements (e.g., cosmetic procedures) are not eligible for Financial Assistance. b) Medi-Cal Patients with Share of Cost: Medi-Cal patients who are responsible to pay share of cost are not eligible to apply for Financial Assistance to reduce the amount of Share of Cost owed. Hospitals shall seek to collect these amounts from the patients. c) Patient declines covered services: An Insured Patient who elects to seek services that are not covered under the patient's benefit agreement (such as an HMO patient who seeks out- of-network services from Sutter, or a patient refuses to transfer from a Sutter hospital to an in-network facility) is not eligible for Financial Assistance d) Insured Patient does not cooperate with third-party payer: An Insured Patient who is insured by a third-party payer that refuses to pay for services because the patient failed to provide information to the third-party payer necessary to determine the third- party payer's liability is not eligible for Financial Assistance. e) Payer pays patient directly: If a patient receives payment for services directly from an indemnity, Medicare Supplement, or other payer, the patient is not eligible for Financial Assistance for the services. f) Information falsification: Hospitals may refuse to award Financial Assistance to patients who falsify information regarding Family Income, household size or other information in their eligibility application. g) Third party recoveries: If the patient receives a financial settlement or judgment from a third- party tortfeasor that caused the patient's injury, the patient must use the settlement or judgment amount to satisfy any patient account balances, and is not eligible for Financial Assistance. h) Professional (physician) Services: Services of physicians such as anesthesiologists, radiologists, hospitalists, pathologists, etc. are not covered under this policy. Any exceptions are set forth in Exhibit A. Many physicians have charity care policies that allow patients to apply for free or discounted care. Patients should obtain information about a physician's charity care policy directly from their physician. B. APPLICATION PROC ESS 1. Each Hospital shall make all reasonable efforts to obtain from the patient or his or her representative information about whether private or public health insurance may fully or partially cover the charges for care rendered by the Hospital to a patient. A patient who indicates at any time the financial inability to pay a bill for Hospital Services shall be {00711610 v.14} 14-294 evaluated for Financial Assistance. In order to qualify as an Uninsured Patient, the patient or the patient's guarantor must verify that he or she is not aware of any right to insurance or government program benefits that would cover or discount the bill. All patients should be encouraged to investigate their potential eligibility for government program assistance if they have not already done so. 2. Patients who wish to apply for Financial Assistance shall use the Sutter Health standardized application form, the \"Application for Financial Assistance\", Exhibit B. 3. Patients may request assistance with completing the Application for Financial Assistance in person at the Sutter Health Hospitals listed on Exhibit A, over the phone at 855-398-1633, through the mail, or via the Sutter Health website ( www.sutterhealth.org ). 4. Patients should mail Applications for Financial Assistance to Sutter Health, P. O. Box 619010, Roseville, CA 95661-9998 Attn: Charity Care Application. 5. Patients should complete the Application for Financial Assistance as soon as possible after receiving Hospital Services. Failure to complete and return the application within 240 days of the date the Hospital first sent a post-discharge bill to the patient may result in the denial of Financial Assistance. C. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION 1. The Hospital will consider each applicant's Application for Financial Assistance and grant Financial Assistance when the patient meets the eligibility criteria set forth in section A.1 and has received (or will receive) Hospital Service(s). 2. Patients also may apply for governmental program assistance, which may be prudent if the particular patient requires ongoing services. a) The Hospital should assist patients in determining if they are eligible for any governmental or other assistance, or if a patient is eligible to enroll with plans in the California Health Benefit Exchange (i.e. Covered California). b) If a patient applies, or has a pending application, for another health coverage program at the same time that he or she applies for Financial Assistance, the application for coverage under another health coverage program shall not preclude the pat ient's eligibility for Financial Assistance. 3. Once a Full Charity Care or High Medical Cost Charity Care determination has been made, a \"Notification Form\" ( Exhibit D) will be sent to each applicant advising them of the Hospital's decision. 4. Patients are presumed to be eligible for Financial Assistance for a period of one year after the Hospital issues the Notification Form to the patient. After one year, patients must re-apply for Financial Assistance. 5. If the Financial Assistance determination creates a credit balance in favor of a patient, the refund of the credit balance shall include interest on the amount of the overpayment from the date of the patient's payment at the statutory rate (10% per annum) pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 127440, provided that Hospitals are not required to refund a credit balance that is, together with interest, less than five dollars ($5). {00711610 v.14} 14-294 D.

COMMUNITY HEALTH INNOVATION FUND Sutter West Bay Hospitals, a California nonprofit corporation doing business as California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC), entered into a developm ent agreement with the City and County of San Francisco related to the construc tion of CPMC's medical facilitie s. In July 2013, representatives from CPMC's Community Health Programs, San Fr ancisco Department of Public Health, and The San Francisco Foundation (TSFF) formed a Comm ittee to oversee the strategy for granting $8,600,000 of the Community Health Innovation Fund monies. To date, The San Francisco Foundation has received si x payments totaling $8,600,000. 2013 Grants The first round of grants was awarded to organiza tions focused on 1) Affordable Care Act reform readiness for community clinics; 2) strategic op portunities to improve services to people with HIV/AIDS; and 3) expansion of co mprehensive mental health servic es in San Francisco. The grants were made to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation ($465,000), Curry Senior Center ($185,000), Mission Neighborhood Health Center ($128,700), and San Francisco Community Clinic Consortium ($186,000). 2013 Outcomes The grant supported the construction of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation new site. SFAF opened the doors of its new facility in 2016 a nd is in the process of completing the OSHA requirements necessary to relocate their clinical services. The ne w, 14,700 square-foot, three-story building will enable The AIDS Foundation to ex pand case management services by 25%, mental health counseling by 25%, substance use and ha rm reduction counseling by 50%, and HIV and STI screening up to 40%. Curry Senior Center successfully completed organizational requirements for compliance, which 2 resulted in their ability to be certified for Medica re reimbursement. They were also able to expand their diabetes educational services, hire a Span ish-speaking Health Coach, and provide Aftercare Group Sessions on self-care. Funding allowed Mission Neighborhood Health Center and the SF Community Clinic Consortium to conduct a financial assessment and busine ss planning process to test the feasibility of the Clinic Consortium to create an Independe nt Practice Association as a strategy to maximize reimbursement rates under the new ACA. The C linic Consortium also pr ovided training to over 120 clinic staff on ACA, enrollment and elig ibility regulations, and alternative payment methodologies. Clinic staff in turn, enrolled thou sands of San Francisco pa tients into Healthy San Francisco, Medicare, Medi-Cal , and Covered California. 2014 Grants In 2014, two-year grants were awarded to nine community-based clinics to enhance care coordination with the goal of re ducing re-hospitalization rates for high risk pa tients. Each of the following clinics received $220,588 totaling $1,985,292: HealthRight 360, Glide Foundation, Lyon-Martin Women's Health Services, Mission Neighborhood Health Center, Native American Health Center, North East Medical Services, St. Anthony Foundation, SF Medical Center Outpatient Clinic, and the Women's Community Clinic . HR360 received an additional $25,000 to provide technical assistance to align Coordinated Care Protoc ols for all clinic partners. Funds were also allocated to the Progress Foundation ($280,000) to esta blish a stronger partnership with the San Francisco Police Departme nt to transport homeless individuals suffering from mental illness to Dore Urgent Care Clinic , a community-based health and mental health treatment facility rather than to priv ate and public hospital emergency rooms. 2014 Outcomes The Progress Foundation was able to hire additional staff to expand to 24-hour care and establish a stronger partnership with the San Francisco Po lice Department regarding transport of homeless and mentally ill patients. The number of clie nts who received immediate clinical treatment increased by 90%. First year results from HealthRight360, Glide Foundation, Lyon-Martin Women's Health Services, Mission Neighborhood Health Center, Native America n Health Center, North East Medical Services, St. Anthony Foundation, SF Medical Center Outpatient Clinic and the Women's Community Clinic reported utilization of f unds to hire additional staff to improve their data management systems and to provide target ed outreach and follow-up for patients discharged from hospitals and the emergency room. An av erage of 75% of patient s identified as hospital discharge patients and 70% of emergency room patie nts were contacted foll owing their release for follow-up appointments within 7 days. Some clinics reported up to 95% of known hospital discharges were contacted and 94% of known emergency room disc harges contacted within the seven day timeframe. The funding also requir ed improvement of their response time to non- scheduled patient referrals to be opened and revi ewed within 10 days. The majority of clinics reported an improved time response rate of 99%. 3 In general, the grant reports re flect significant improvements from prior years of operation. The clinics continue to work towards achieving \"clean and updated\" data as cost efficiently as possible and also continue their efforts to reconcile the li mitations of the Lifetime Clinical Report (software platform utilized by SF General and some hosp ital systems) to receive timely notification on hospitalization and emergency room vi sits of clinic patients. The majority of clinics have hired Referral and Care Coordinators or Nurse Case Ma nagers who can provide the \"high-touch\" needed to insure clinic patients adhere to their appointments. One clinic reported that of the 1,483 referrals initiated between January-March, only 4% were no-shows, a dramatic improvement from prior reports. Funding has allowed clinics to utilize technology and pioneer inn ovative strategies. Two clinics (St. Anthony's Foundation and North East Medical Services) have instituted a Home Visitation program for patients identified as high ri sk and who face logistical and social barriers to meeting their appointments. St. Anthony's Foundati on is employing virtual c onsultations with their physician using Apple's FaceTime. In addition, St . Anthony's has instituted Care Messaging to all of its patients. A consistent challenge cited by the majority of clinics is in the recruitment, hiring and retention of qualified staff to provide Care Coordinati on largely due to the low salary structure and high cost of living in the Bay Area. The final reports for this set of grants will be submitted by the clinics in early July, 2017. 2015 Grants In 2015, the Community Health Innovation Fund Co mmittee identified the need for direct funding to community-based organizations focused on mental health services for hi gh-risk populations and improved quality of life for low-income seniors. Gran ts were made to the fo llowing organizations: Bayview-Hunter's Point Multipurpose Senior Services : to increase access to mental health services for vulnerable seniors a nd adults with disabilities in low-income, underserved communities through piloting a Community-Based Health Home ($150,000) and to build operational capacity for the Senior Ex-Offender Program to provide expande d services to aging formerly incarcerated African American males. ($100,000) Stepping Stone Senior Services : to increase access to Mental Health Services for vulnerable Seniors and Adults with Disabi lities in underserved communities through a pilot of the Community- Based Home Health model. ($150,000) Central City Hospitality House : to support the Community Buildi ng Program to ameliorate the negative impact of trauma exposure on community and CCHH staff members by increasing access to a range of mental health and support services. ($150,000) Westside Mental Health Services : to provide African Ameri can low and moderate-income children, youth, and families with culturally based mental health se rvices including healing circles and linkages to outpatient and primary care treatment that will help them take control of their recovery and healing from mental illness, substance abuse, viol ence, racism, and trauma. ($90,000) St. Anthony Foundation : to support infrastructure need s to increase the delivery of comprehensive, high quality healthcare services at no cost to low-income residents of San Francisco's Tenderloi n neighborhood. ($420,000) 4 Progress Foundation : to sustain their 24-hour clin ical services and to align their billing system to capture MediCal reimbursement for mental health services. ($72,000) 2015 Outcomes Over the course of their grant, Bayview-Hunters Point Multipurpose Senior Services and Stepping Stone Senior Services each identified 10-15 seniors, ta rgeting formerly homeless with mental health diagnosis or livi ng alone without existing social support. The target population utilized the Emergency Room as their primary source of care. Both organizations hired a RN Navigator who addressed immediate crises, pr ovided health/mental health assessment and education, medication management, accompaniment to health appointments, follow-up care and referral for specialty services. Results point to im proved health, mental hea lth, and reduction in ER visits and hospitalizations when compared with the baseline data that was collected. Of 17 seniors enrolled in the Bayview-Hunters Point MSSP project , eight participated in weekly professional counseling sessions resulting in improvement in th eir quality of life and decreased depression and isolation. The funding also supporte d participation by both agencies in a State cohort of senior service organizations working to design an Adult Day Healthcare /Community-Based Health Home model. Continued funding support for both projects was a major challenge. Both organizations cited the passage of the City's Prop I (Dignity Fund), would provide a funding stream to sustain the service, however, in the case of Stepping Stone , funds were not available to continue the program. Bayview-Hunters Point Multipurpose Senior Services also received funds to strengthen their Senior Ex-Offender Program. Funds for dedica ted staff time allowed them to purchase 1768 Newcomb for $1.6 million and to raise $80,000 from new funding sources. The building (old police station) will allow them to provide transitional housing for14 formerly incarcerated and homeless residents. This project will be supported by funds from the SF Department of Probation. Central City Hospitality House exceeded their goal of providi ng 16 community events (goal was four) focused on violence prevention, increasing community cohesion and ability to respond to and recover from trauma. The events engaged 345 co mmunity members (goal was 150). In addition, 80 participants were assessed and referred to beha vioral health services. \"Talking Tech in the Tenderloin\" provided a di scussion series between tech comp any representatives and community members addressing displacement and workforce needs. CCHH also provided two 17-week sessions on Healing, Organizing an d Leadership Development for 16 interns (Peer Advocates). Training graduates stated that th e sessions reduced isolation, help ed them develop new leadership skills, and increased social c onnection to the Tenderloin comm unity. Through the Harm Reduction Therapy Center, therapists provided services to 84 participants of which 77% maintained sufficient engagement to achieve at least one Wellness goal. For CCHH staff who experienced an increased level of crisis and trauma over the prior year, funds were used to engage Blooming Willow Coaching which brought together a team of over 30 Bay Area coaches, therap ists and trainers to provide individual wellness coachin g and skills building workshops. The evaluation survey found that 92% reported having built new skills to support their navigation of unsafe and stressful environments at the workplace and 92% increased skills in supporting their peers. Blooming Willow established a Culture Keepers Committee, a peer-based wellness support group within the agency to sustain the gains made in improvi ng staff cohesion and morale. Having built staff 5 cohesion, the agency was able to move forward on the implementation of their new theory of change and commitment to their mission. Westside Community Services provided 196 culturally-based healing circles to over 164 community residents who were suffering from trau ma-inflicted depression and other psychoses. Though falling short of their goal of engaging 400 part icipants, the project cited success in bringing first responder survivors of violence to address their own sel f-care. The grant also supported training of Healing Circle Facilitators (commu nity leaders/residents) trained by the Bay Area Association of Black Psychologist s and the Copeland Center's Welln ess Recovery Action Planning. Facilitators received the Community Inclusion Peer Facilitator Cert ification. Healing Circles were provided to targeted populations: Women in R ecovery, People Living with HIV, Ajani Youth, Westside Man Up Project (formerl y incarcerated African American men), and parents of murdered children. Eighty-seven percent (87%) reported pos itive outcomes and improvement in their mental health and a decrease of nega tive impacts of trauma. The gr ant allowed Westside Community Services to provide the rationale for culturally based heal ing circles as a valid treatment protocol. The services have continued with a grant from the Office of Children, Youth and their Families. The healing circles have been built in as a comp onent of a larger collaborative of nine African American partner agencies working to provide co mprehensive care for high-risk African American youth and their families. St. Anthony Foundation received a two-year grant to help meet the system requirements as a new Federally Qualified Health Center. With these funds, they have been able to enroll 500 new patients, design and implement a sliding fee scale, a nd hire a new Clinical Social Worker to address the complex health and mental health needs of patie nts. They are working to connect patients being discharged from homeless shelters by providi ng transportation support (Uber, Lyft) to attend medical appointments. The clinic currently ha s 300 Medi-Cal managed patients waiting assignment to a provider network. In Year 2 of their grant (2017) they will need to fully implement the HRSA Program Requirements and accounting systems as we ll as strengthen their outreach to high risk patients. Funding to keep the Progress Foundation's Dore Urgent Care Clinic open everyday for 24 hours increased referrals from SFPD by 56% and redu ced referrals to SFGH Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES) resulting in a 50% drop in \"Red Alert Days\" where PES was challenged with the large number of incoming patients and limited medical staff. There was also a significant reduction in the number of individuals transported to private hospital emergency rooms. The Progress Foundation Urgent Care Clinic was instrumental as a model and in providing data in the passage of SB 82 establishing a funding sour ce for community-based psychiatri c clinics in other counties. 2016 Grants Drug Policy Alliance : to support planning and implementati on of a multi-departmental pre-booking diversion program that will reduce incarceration and increase access to health and mental health services for SF high risk populations and to comp lete a proposal for $5.9 million in funding from the California Board of State and Comm unity Corrections. ($250,000 over 12 months) 6 Central City Hospitality House : to support and train peer health volunteers, staff, and outreach teams to enhance their ability to engage othe r community members, leading to a healthier neighborhood with people seeing themselves as part of the solution. ($500,000 over 2 years) North of Market Tenderloin Co mmunity Benefit Corporation : to improve the stability, livability and sustainability of the Tenderloin through the Tenderloin Community Benefit Corporation Healthy Neighborhood In itiative. ($150,000 over 24 months) Public Health Foundation Enterprises : to reduce unnecessary use of hospital emergency room services by providing transportation to th e Sobering Center. ($35,000 over 12 months) 2016 Outcomes Drug Policy Alliance has completed the planning and implementation of a multi-departmental pre- booking diversion program to reduce the recidivi sm rate for drug and alcohol offenders and strengthened collaboration acro ss city departments with community-based organizations.

To date, the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion or LEAD is operating in the Tenderloin/Civic Center and Mission neighborhoods. For each neighborhood, a team of law enforcement officers and a complementary team of social service providers, including outre ach workers and case managers, work to provide assistance to high-risk individuals referred by SFPD and BART Police. As of March 2018, 62 individuals have been referred for services. Th e goal of the program is to serve 250 individuals over the next 2 years. This grant also provide d support to submit a proposal for $5.9million to the California Board of State and Community Corrections on behalf of the City. The City was awarded the full $5.9 million and scored the highe st of all applic ations received. Central City Hospitality House has completed 12 months of their 24-month grant. This grant will end on June 30, 2019. They have made significant progress in reaching their 3 primary outcomes by hiring a Training & Volunteer Coordinator and Deputy Director of Programs. Funding also continues to provide peer staff support and training that has resu lted in an increased level of services to community residents. The increased level of coaching s upport for staff has resulted in a reduction of police involvement and increased staff' s capacity to identify, in tervene and de-escalate potential crisis situations. In the first year, over 75 volunteers enrolled in 38 trainings contributing 2,500 service hours in one or more of the agen cy's six programs. Additionally, 140 community members (their goal was 75) ha ve participated in community-building activities including neighborhood forums on public safet y, gentrification and voter educa tion. Ten peer staff (formerly homeless) was promoted (goal was 3 staff) within the agency and agency partnerships strengthened with the Tenderloin CBD and Mayor's Of fice of Civic Engagement multi-neighborhood ambassadors. Funding has strengthened their capacity to offer joint training activities, team meetings and develop one-on-one support. Twenty- one in-service trainings have been provided (goal was 12) on harm reduction techniques, client engagement, conflict prevention/de- escalation, resource referrals, etc. with 105 individuals particip ating in at least 1 traini ng and 70 participated in multiple trainings. More activities are planned for the second year. 7 North of Market Tenderloin Communi ty Benefit Corporation (NMTCBC) In their 1st year report (of a 2-year grant) NMTCBC comple ted their strategic plan to guide them to 2020 and they are now in the proces s of an Executive search that they hope to complete by mid- 2018. Staff has expanded from 2 part-time to 3 full-time positions. They have moved to a storefront office on Ellis Street to be more accessible to the Tenderl oin community. Half of the new office space is designed as a community meetin g place. NMTCBC has hosted over 20 meetings during the grant period. They successfully negotia ted a new street cleaning contract with a new vendor reducing cost by $185,000. The new vendor (Downtown Streets Team) provides an employment path for homeless individuals. Asse ssment rates have increased and cleaning costs reduced creating an income stream to support th e new program staff. The fundraising goal was $325,000. The actual amount raised through grants and earned income was $651,500. The Safe Senior program is in place. Over 26,000 seniors and 17,945 children were assisted with safe street crossings in the first year. Six Safe Senior Ambassadors have been hired. The Safe Route to School program is in the pilot stage. Nei ghborhood improvements are more visible, 70 positive street banners have been installed and over 100 residents have participated in each of their community meetings. Public Health Foundation Enterprises - Sobering Center This grant provided critical tran sportation services to divert in dividuals from hospital emergency rooms to the Sobering Center where they are o ffered additional services to promote medical detoxification, recovery and case management. Funds allowed the Center and its services to be open 24 hours a day. During the 2016-17 fiscal y ear, the Center receive d 1,125 total calls for transport, 981calls were made from emergency rooms and 144 from shelters, clinics, treatment programs. The Center anticipates the numbers will increase in FY 2017-18. 2017 Grants Reports for 2017 grants are not due until July 20 18, therefore progress on the grants mentioned below will appear in the May 2019 report. Public Health Foundation-Sobering Center Transport : to provide interim support to maintain transport services. ($150,000 one year) St. Anthony's Foundation : to increase part-time Outreach Work er position to full-time to increase patient referral to thei r clinic. ($35,000 one year) Central City Hospitality House : to support housing placement, cas e management, and leadership development of Tenderloin residents to advocat e for improved living conditions and access to services. ($167,000 one year) Garden 2 Table : to support the Camelot Green Kitchen project and cultural events to promote healthy living for SRO residents in th e Tenderloin community. ($125,000 one year) Neighborhood Empowerment Network : to engage Bayview community agencies and residents in a community planning process to ensure the hea lth and safety of resi dents. ($150,000 one year) 8 Women's Community Clinic : to provide infrastructure suppor t for updated financial and patient tracking software and staff time to comp lete the merger with HR360. ($50,000 one year) 2017 Grant Outcomes St. Anthony's Foundation (SAMC) - $35,000 to support outreach and care coordination. Funding supported part-time staff to provide outreach to increase patient enrollment and establish protocol and a system for follow- up care. Of their goal to provi de contact within 7 days of discharge from an inpatient hospital stay, SAMC was able to reach 65% percent of patients, short of their 100% target. However, they were able to de termine that their patient records were incomplete or incorrect for the 35% who did not receive contact. To address th is, they worked in partnership with the ER nurses at discharge to insure patien t information was updated and correct. They also allocated staff time to scrub existing data and upd ate PCP and LCR data. Their efforts to reduce 30- day re-hospitalization rates realized higher outc omes (80%). One hundred percent of non-scheduled referrals to SAMC were opened and reviewed wi thin 10 days due primarily to the new Referral Care Coordinator and increased use of the \"e-referral\". SAMC is piloting expanded weekday- afternoon office hours and evaluating the benefit/cost of providing Saturday service. SAMC has expanded patient-visit reviews to in clude orientation/education rega rding services appropriate for SAMC versus hospitals, the use of the After-Hours Pager System and use of SF Health Plan's/Blue Cross 24-Hour Advice Nurse Hotline. SAMC has decreased its appointment no-show rate from 25% to 10% over the grant period. Funding supported improvements in workflow processes, better use of EMR, and new technologies such as the \"Call Point\" appointment reminder system thus increasing efficiencies in both admi nistrative and medical care. Central City Hospitality House - $167,000 to s upport housing placement, case management and leadership development of Tenderloin residents to advocate for improved living conditions and access to services. CCHH exceeded all of their grant goals to provide se rvices to formerly homeless individuals in the Tenderloin. Of their original goal of assessing 80 CCHH participants , 92 individuals were assessed by Community Building Program case managers (m any of whom were formerly homeless) for improved housing opportunities, eligibility for public benefits and referrals to behavioral and physical health resources. In addition, th eir goal of maintaining housing placement for 75 participants was exceeded by serving a total of 110 individuals. Of these, 100% maintained or improved their housing without re -experiencing homelessness during the course of the year. Eighty-two participants were referred for behavi oral or physical health needs, and 80 residents completed a case plan identifying goals, ti me frame for completion, and documented accomplishment of agreed-upon goals. For their Healing, Organizing, Leadership Development (HOLD) training project, 21 commu nity residents enrolled (goa l was 8) and 14 demonstrated improved leadership skills through a civic engageme nt activity (goal was 4). Graduates of the program return to lead one or more information workshops focused on effects of psychological trauma all of who have had di rect experience with trauma. Close to 300 community residents participated in at least 1 of 13 community events which included Poetry and Spoken Word nights, monthly sidewalk activation ev ents, neighborhood forums on comm unity issues and a workshop on \"City Hall Works For You\" co-hosted by the Clerk of the Board of Superv isors and held in the Board Chamber at City Hall. For many, this was th eir first exposure to City procedures and first 9 time in City Hall. These series of events reduc ed isolation and further strengthened connection between community residents. The HOLD (leadersh ip development) model of trauma-informed leadership is regarded as an innovative model and has been adopt ed by several of their partner organizations. The HOLD training pr oject resulted in an organizati onal transformation as well. Four members of CCHH's Board of Directors are graduates of HOLD, thus furthering their vision for a truly community-led organization. From Garden to Table (FGTT) - $125,000 to es tablish a safer cooking system and cooking instruction to promote better health outcom es for SRO residents in the Tenderloin. FGTT's goal is to promote recovery from subs tance abuse and the trauma of homelessness by providing cooking lessons promoting healthy foods and providing access to in-home cooking equipment designed to promote safety for SRO residents in the Tenderloin community. FGTT partnered with the Auburn Hotel, a 70-unit pe rmanent supportive housing site for previously homeless veterans. Each unit was only equipped w ith a mini-refrigerator and microwave. The units did not include cooking facilities though the resident s requested safe and clean cooking facilities for meal preparation. FGTT provided a fully equipp ed, environmentally safe cooking system to 13 participants who completed the on site 6-week class. The Aubur n graduates prepared food for 31 managers of other SROs and community representa tives. In addition to classes at the Auburn, FGTT completed a total of 122 health, cooking a nd physical activity classes, 3 Safety and Prevention Exchange Project gra duations, and 10 community events. Participation totaled 1,295 Tenderloin residents, managers and community organizers. FGTT in partnership with the San Francisco Recovery Theatre met with 6 Tende rloin SRO managers (Auburn, Cova Cadillac, Camelot, Windsor, and Jefferson hotels) to develop collaborative relationships. In total, FGTT met, networked and participated in meetings with 120 stakeholders and SRO mana gers. FGTT staff also participated in the San Francisco Food Security Task Force and partnered with the Saint Francis Foundation to strategize reaching more Tenderloi n SROs to provide safe and healthy cooking systems. To address concerns regarding sustaina bility of the project, FGTT has submitted proposals to 11 foundations and created a crowd-funding platform. Women's Community Clinic - $50,000 to s upport completion of the merger with HealthRIGHT360. The determination whether to move forward with the merger was completed on time with both agencies providing documentation and conducting due diligence. The two organizations' Board of Directors and Leadership teams entered into agreement in April 2017. High Board and staff satisfaction remained a priority throughout the merger process and board and staff retreats have fostered a stronger sense of unity and commitment to the Clinic's mission. A gap analysis review for FQHC compliance was completed and a remedia tion plan to address gaps was put in place. However, WCC did not get approval for their ow n FQHC status. HealthRIGHT 360 was recently awarded FQHC-lookalike status that fully complie s with the requirements of Section 330. To address sustainability, a busine ss plan and financial model was completed in June 2017 that highlighted the need to increase patient enrollment, convert offices to clinic space, and increase clinic staff time to see more patients. To insure continuity of care and to hold to WCC's value for patient-centered care, the leadership team solicited regular feedback from patie nts and staff as well. A regular monthly all-staff meeting has been instituted to create space for information exchange and feedback. Public Health Foundation/Sobering Center - $150,000 10 The purpose of this grant is to reduce unnecessary use of emergency room department services and to increase access to services and support for clie nts to participate in r ecovery and wellness from their substance abuse.

The organization was able to complete a sustainability plan based on the production and marketing of organic products. G2T enriched the Tenderloin community with celebratory events that brought re sidents together using healthy f ood, physical exercise and music to improve resident mental and physical health. Th ey also participated in over 52 meetings to coordinate delivery of services with other Tenderloin service pr oviders, SRO hotel managers and residents. Public Health Foundation/Sobering Center used their grant to continue to provide transport of intoxicated clients to the Sobering Center. Duri ng FY18/19, the Sobering Center received 850 total calls for transport, and completed 816 transports. There was a noted increase in number of clients transported and provided quality services to i ndividuals regardless of their race or economic 11 situation. Institute on Aging/Swindells Center for Adult Day Services was able to secure a lease with the Presidio Trust for a 7,034 square foot historic bui lding in San Francisco. The acquisition of the new site allowed them to expand services from 53 client s to 96 clients and hire 16 additional staff due to a doubling of service space. The grant also f unded the ADA required renovations to the building and supported their fundraising efforts. They have successfully raised $2.1 million to date.

SisterWeb Doula Project has completed 12 months of their 24- month grant. The purpose of the grant is to create a new culturally-based model to reduce high infant mortality rates of African American and Pacific Islanders in San Francisco. In their first year of operation, they have established a number of successful partnerships. One is with Hea lth Connect One (HCO) which is the only accrediting body for doulas. HCO is res ponsible for doula training. They have also conducted outreach to 100 hospitals and have partners hips with 4 out of 5 delivery hospitals. At the time of the report, 13 women reported healthy births with another 20 in the pipeline. They are working with UC Berkeley on an evaluation of quality of care. They are also working at the State legislative level to craft language for a bill on dou la care and a service reimbursement process. Seventy percent of their project budg et for the next 3 years has been raised. The project is already being recognized as a national model with requests for technical assistance to recreate it in other cities. Elder Care Alliance/Dementia Inclusive Communities Initiative successfully developed new tools for family members, caregivers, and aging prof essionals using arts and cu ltural events to foster greater connection and relationships with individuals with demen tia. Materials developed were translated into Spanish, Chinese, Russian and Tagalog. The project also focused on strengthening cross-agency connection of senior service providers by hosting a series of workshops and meetings on promoting inclusive communities utilizing vari ous forms of technology. The project forged partnerships with the College of Alameda, Alam eda Healthcare and Wellness Center, SF Institute on Aging, Campus for Jewish Living, Contemporar y Jewish Museum, St. James Episcopal Church, Visitation Valley Community Center and SOMArts. They reached families and senior serving agencies in the Excelsior, Richmond/Laurel He ights, Civic Center/Downtown, Visitation Valley and SOMA. In total, they engaged 525 peopl e of color and collabora ted with over 20 key stakeholders in the field of dementia services. For their innovative work, they received the Mather Lifeways Promising Practices Award. 2019 Grants Regional Pacific Islander Task Force - $20,000 To continue to raise awareness of the health needs of Pacific Islanders in San Francisco/ Bay Area and to align Bay Area Public Health Department efforts to better address social, economic and health disparities in Paci fic Islander communities. 12 COMMUNITY HEALTH INNOVATION FUND Account description 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Grand Total Beginning Balance 6,760,566 4,044,950 1,799,841 Fees 13 WORKFORCE DEVELO PMENT FUND As a companion to the Community Health Innovation Fund, Sutter West Bay Hospital, a California nonprofit corporation doing business as California Pacific Medical Ce nter (CPMC) entered into a Workforce Fund Grant Agreement with The San Fran cisco Foundation on October 9, 2013. As part of the development agreement, a Workforce Fund of $3,000,000 was created to provide grants to educational institutions and non-profit organizations in commun ities that are impacted by CPMC's hospital renovation and construction project. The goal of the fund is to engage in barrier redu ction and job training for employment opportunities with CPMC, in accordance wi th the terms of the Workforce Fund Agreement. The affected communities include the Wester n Addition, Tenderloin, Mission/SOMA, Outer Mission/Excelsior, Chinatown and Southeastern neighborhoods in the City of San Francisco. To manage the Workforce Fund, a committee of fund advisors (Workforce Development Committee) was created and consists of a repres entative from the Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD) on behalf of the City, a representative from CPMC, and a representative from The San Francisco Foundation (TSFF). TSFF received its first payment of $2,000,000 towards the Workforce Fund on November 26, 2013, and a second payment of $1,000,000 on November 25, 2014, completing the $3,000,000 pledge. As part of the Development Agreement, TSFF took a combined seven percent management fee of $210,000. Since the last report in May 2018, the committee granted funds to five Barrier Reduction grantees, Jewish Vocation Services (JVS), Code Te nderloin/ Downtown Streets Team (DST), Self-Help for the Elderly (SHE), Success Centers SF (SCSF), and FACES SF. Throughout the 2018 grant year, the Workforce Development Committee con tinued to meet quarterly. On April 30, 2019, the original two grantees, JVS and SHE, completed their fourth year of funding, SCSF and FACES SF completed their third year of funding, and DST completed their first year of funding of a committed two-year agreement. FY 2015 & FY 2016 Grants In determining how best to allocate the grant making f unds, to help reduce barriers to accessing jobs at CPMC, the Workforce Committee engaged a local consulting firm, KDG Enterprises to plan, coordinate and facilitate a seri es of eight focus group meetings. The focus group meetings provided the Workforce Committee with essential input on stru ctural issues which pres ent barriers for entry- level job seekers. This input was invaluable in our design of prosp ective grants to improve systems that provide training, workforce experience and skill building. The Foundation issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) in late 2014 that was developed based on the recommendations from the focus group meetings. The purpose of the RFP was to soli cit proposals from experi enced, educational and nonprofit organizations with a prove n track record of providing inte grated and coordinated, case- managed barrier removal, training and workforce preparedness services for non-construction, non- managerial and non-supervisory, en try-level employment at CPMC a nd/or other medical settings. Specifically, grantees were selected to provide Job Readiness Training, and/ or On-the-Job Training services which were recommended during the focus group meetings. Of the 13 proposals submitted, four organizations were approved for funding totaling $540,000: 14 1. Jewish Vocational Services: To provide program support for j ob readiness training supported paid work experience, and placement a ssistance into living wage jobs to low-income San Franciscan residents at CPMC, and/or other health care facilities in San Francisco. ($150,000) 2. Mission Hiring Hall: To provide program support for job read iness training and placement services designed to overcome barriers to employment for low income, minority, and underserved San Francisco residents. ($150,000) 3. Positive Resource Center: To provide program support for job readiness training and placement in employment for disabled, low-income job seekers in San Francisco County. ($90,000) 4. Self-Help for the Elderly: To provide program support to ensu re employment barrier reduction, job preparedness and placement for immigrant, Limite d English Proficient, Asian Pacific Islander older adults and high needs yout h in the City and County of San Francisco. ($150,000) Upon receiving the funds, the funded organizations worked with the Workforce Committee and the San Francisco workforce system to do outreach to potential program participants in the targeted communities. The organizations were required to meet quarterly as a cohort to share lessons learned and provide peer support to each other for the duration of their grants. The first quarterly meeting was conducted in Apr il 2015 and was an opportunity for the grantees and Committee to meet and establish short, intermediate , and long-term goals. It was also an opportunity to establish and create a co llaborative relationship. The c ohort created the following goals: Goals Short-term goals: Conducting a site visit at CPMC a nd meeting with CPMC hiring manage rs to facilitate relationship building with CPMC; Collaborative marketing and communicat ions materials in order to facilitate identification of clients who may be ready for immediate employment opportunitie s, and to also prevent duplicate efforts in marketing and communication materials. Intermediate goals: Assessment by CPMC with the gr antees in order to address curriculum design and project implementation; Developing referral relationships; CPMC will develop a branding video about who they are, roots, history, value and value added of working for the organization. Long-term goals: Grant implementation, i.e., hiring and training San Fr ancisco residents in th e targeted neighborhoods as noted in the Development Agreement; Quarterly meetings which incl ude sharing best practices am ong the group, sharing to reduce duplication of efforts and conti nued collaborative efforts and l earnings among the cohort members; Rotation of meeting at offices of di fferent grantees and partners to continue the collaborative working relationship and learning opportunities. FY 2015 & FY 2016 Outcomes 15 Through the collaborative effort betw een the four grantees and the Comm ittee over two fiscal years (July 1, 2014 - June 30, 2016), 519 San Francisco residents received either paid work experience, demonstrated gains in workplace competencies (i .e. computer/administrative training, academic skills and language skills), job readin ess training or on-the-job traini ng. 347 clients from the targeted neighborhoods have been placed in entry-level po sitions either at CPMC or other healthcare employers in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Of the 347 clients, 53 have been placed directly at CPMC medical facilities. FY 2017 Grants In FY17, the Committee renewed the original four gr antees but noted two neighborhoods lacked direct grantee representation: The Southeastern and Western Addition neighborhoods. Responding to this, the Committee released a duplicate RFP focused on these two specific neighborhoods and approved two additional grants to the followi ng organizations for a total of $250,000: 1. Success Center SF: To create a Healthcare Pathway for low-income residents in the Western Addition neighborhood of San Francisco, who face mu ltiple barriers to employment to obtain and retain jobs in healthcare. ($125,000) 2. Young Community Developers: To deliver job readiness training and associated placement services for residents of the Southeast sect or of San Francisco with CPMC, a nd/or other health care facilities in San Francisco. ($125,000) Additionally, in 2017 grants to the or iginal four grantees were renewe d for another year for a total of $500,000: 1. Jewish Vocational Services: To provide program support for j ob readiness training, supported paid work experience, and placement a ssistance into living wage jobs to low-income San Franciscan residents at CPMC, and/or other health care facilities in San Francisco. ($125,000) 2. Mission Hiring Hall: To provide program support for job read iness training and placement services designed to overcome barriers to employment for low income, minority, and underserved San Francisco residents. ($125,000) 3. Positive Resource Center: To provide program support for job readiness training and placement in employment for disabled, low-income job seekers in San Francisco County. ($125,000) 4. Self-Help for the Elderly: To provide program support to ensu re employment barrier reduction, job preparedness and placement for immigrant, Limite d English Proficient, Asian Pacific Islander older adults and high needs yout h in the City and County of San Francisco. ($125,000) FY 2017 Goals The goals of the FY2017 grant portfolio were simila r to the goals of the FY2016 grant portfolio, with variance within the short-term goals. Short-term goals: Familiarize grantees new to the cohort with the hi ring process of CPMC and facilitate relationships between the CPMC Recruitment Services T eam Member and the CPMC hiring managers. Align program curriculum and training with the re quired qualifications of open CPMC positions. 16 Share marketing and communications materials to f acilitate identification of clients who may be ready for immediate employment opportunities or iden tify clients that requir e different types and levels of training, as well as to prevent duplicative efforts. Orient new staff members of the individual organization to existing practices of the cohort and the relationship between the cohor t, CMPC, OEWD and TSFF. Intermediate goals: Continued alignment and assessment by CPMC with the grantees to addre ss curriculum design and project implementation; Develop referral relationships; CPMC to develop a branding video about CPMC, i.e ., who CPMC is, its roots, history, value and value added of working for the organization. Continued alignment between hiring projections for CPMC and required placements by grantees. Long-term goals: Grant implementation, i.e., hiring and training San Fr ancisco residents in th e targeted neighborhoods as required by the Development Agreement; Quarterly meetings which incl ude sharing best practices am ong the group, sharing to reduce duplication of efforts and conti nued collaborative efforts and l earnings among the cohort members; Rotation of meeting at offices of di fferent grantees and partners to continue the collaborative working relationship and learning opportunities. Strengthen the workforce training and services in frastructure in the Te nderloin Neighborhood to increase healthcare job placements for Tenderloin residents. FY 2017 Outcomes CPMC and OEWD have played an inte gral role in the overall process. CPMC continues to work closely with each of the grantees from coordinating meetings with their hiring managers, to working directly with the grantees to discuss CPMC's hiri ng needs and strengthen ing the relationship between the grantees and hiring managers, as well as partnering with the O ffice of Economic and Workforce Development and The San Francisco Foundation to identify new grantees. Through collaborative efforts between the six gran tees and the Committee over the FY17 grant period (May 1, 2016 - April 30, 2017), 476 San Francisco resi dents received either paid work experience, demonstrated gains in workplace competencies (i .e. computer/administrative training, academic skills, language skills, Medical Assi stant training), barrier removal services , job readiness training or on-the-job training. 330 clients from the targeted neighborhoods have been pl aced in entry-level positions either at CPMC or other healthcare employers in San Fr ancisco and the Bay Area. Grantees of the CPMC cohort exceed their overall placement goal of 192 by 172%. Of the 330 placements, 22 of those were placed at CPMC facilities. The Committee and the grantee cohort will co ntinue to strategize to meet CPMC's overall job placement goals for target neighborhood residents. Due to poor performance metrics and placements at CPMC healthcare facilities, the Committee discontinued its funding for Positive Resource Center (PRC) and Mission Hiring Hall (MHH) at the end of the 2017 grant period. The target population of PRC wa s not the best fit for th e per diem initial hiring period of the CPMC hiring process. PRC's clients are largely from the disabled population and have stated 17 to PRC that they lose significant health care and other benefits when they accept per diem employment that has uncertain working hours and total compensation befo re being hired permanently. The wage uncertainty created issues around paying rent an d other living expenses upon whic h their overall livelihood depends. MHH has suffered significant staff turnover during the two years they participated in the cohort, and this turnover has significantly affected it s ability to meet the goals it set for its CPMC Workforce Development grants. FY 2019 Grants In 2019, the committee decided to (a) renew four of the six FY 2018 grantees, and (b) add one new organization. Young Community Devel opers that was funded in the fisc al year 2018 was removed from the cohort due to the committee's decision to fund the capacity building of a new organization focused on workforce development in the Tenderloin of San Francisco. The resulting five grantees were renewed for an interim period through June 30, 2019 for funding totaling $557,500: 1. Jewish Vocational Services: To provide program support for j ob readiness training, supported paid work experience, and placement a ssistance into living wage jobs to low-income San Franciscan residents at CPMC, and/or other health care facilities in San Francisco. ($85,000) 2. Self-Help for the Elderly: To provide program support to ensu re employment barrier reduction, job preparedness and placement for immigrant, Limited English Proficient, Asian Pacific Islander, older adults and high needs yout h in the City and County of San Francisco. ($85,000) 3. Success Center San Francisco: To create a Healthcare Pathway for low-income residents in the Western Addition neighborhood of San Francisco, w ho face multiple barriers to employment to obtain and retain jobs in healthcare. ($65,000) 4. FACES SF: To provide job readiness and placement assi stance services for low-income residents of the Southeast Sector of San Francisco to attain cl inical or non-clinical em ployment at CPMC and/or other health care facilities in San Francisco. ($65,000) The committee added Downtown Streets Team to the list of grantees with $75,000 in interim funding: 1. Downtown Streets Team: To provide job readiness and placement assistance services for low- income residents of the Southeast Sector of Sa n Francisco to attain cl inical or non-clinical employment at CPMC and/or other health care facilities in San Francisco. FY 2019 Outcomes In terms of the financial report, funds from the San Francisco F oundation were disbursed in FY 2018 beginning the grant period on July 1st. As of March 31, 2019, the cohort collectively provided some form of workforce training to 295 San Francisco residents. 102 resident s from the targeted neighborhoods as well as other San Francisco 18 neighborhoods were placed in entry-le vel jobs in the healthcare sector . Of the 102 placements, 14 of those were placed directly at CPMC facilities. The report above is representative of the grant's first three quarters (July 1, 2018 - March 31, 2019).

CPMC employees who park at offsite facilities pay subsidized rates that vary by facility. The percentage of employees who participate in the commuter benefits program is approx. 18% (861 employees) 2019 Employee/Physician Commute Survey Summary of Key Results A major component of the TDM Plan and a requirement of the DA is the annual employee/physician commute survey. The survey provides baselines for Sutter Health CPMC (CPMC) relative to reporting data to the SFMTA. CPMC's overall 2019 employee population in San Francisco was approximately 5,240 staff. The survey was administered to eligible staff through our intranet HealthStream platform with 4,532 staff completing the survey, for a response rate of 86.5%. Thus, exceeding the minimum 30% response rate requirement established by SFMTA for statistical validity of the survey. Based on the 2019 survey results, CPMC's singleoccupant vehicle mode share went down 2 percent points as compared to the 2018 mode split baseline. Use of public transit went up 1 percent point, and use of ride hailing services (taxi, Uber or Lyft) went up by another 1 percent point: SOV (drive alone) 54% Public Transit 24% (BART 11%, at 5% and motorcycles at 1%) There were significant shifts in CPMC staff work location, due to the opening of the new Van Ness Hospital, closure of the California Campus, and closure of the Pacific Campus Hospital. Close to 50 percent of staff now works at the Van Ness Campus. Van Ness 49% Davies 19% Mission Bernal 14% Other 11% (Downtown, Civic Center, California, other) Pacific 7% The 2019 survey results also show that there was a reduction of 7 percent points in onstreet parking around CPMC facilities, and a comparable increase in paid parking at CPMC or other facilities. Finally, over 40% of CPMC staff lives within San Francisco County, or within 15 miles from their workplace. However, this number has been declining in recent years, likely due to housing affordability issues. As compared to the 2017 and 2018 surveys, staff has been declining in San Francisco and East Bay counties and increasing in the South Bay and outlying areas, which may be affecting staff commute times and mode choice. San Francisco 43% (San Francisco County) East Bay 21% (Alameda, Contra Costa and Solano Counties) Daly City/South Bay 23% (San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties) North Bay 7% (Marin, Napa and Sonoma Counties) Other 6% 2019 Patient/Visitor Survey Summary Final Report CPMC Sutter Health San Francisco, California May 7, 2020 Patient/Visitor Survey Summary FINAL REPORT Project #33-1999.03 WALKER CONSULTANTS | 3 Executive Summary As part of the development agreement with the City of San Francisco, Sutter Health is required to conduct a patient/visitor survey every three years, until year 2022, to track the transportation mode share of tho se that visit the hospital. The survey was conducted for the first time in 2013 and for the second time in 2016. This report summarizes results for the 2019 survey. The 2019 Patient/Visitor survey was conducted over a period of four weeks, from October 22nd to November 19th of 2019. Surveys were collected during daytime hours at the three CPMC hospital campus complexes - Van Ness, Mission Bernal and Davies. Major Highlights of the Analysis 1. Major takeaway s from the survey analysis are that the majority of visitors to CPMC Sutter Health come from within the City and County of San Francisco. 2. They drive to campus and park in a garage for a fee or park on the street for free, in about equal proportions. 3. Those that park in a garage for a fee typically stay in the hospital for less than 1 hour or for an extended time (more than 3 hours or more than 24 hours ). 4. While those that park on the street for free typically stay in the hospital for more than 1 hour, but less than 3 hours. 5. Distance and travel time play a role in the mode choice of survey respondents . Survey respondents that spent less than 30 minutes to get to CPMC Sutter Health had a higher proportion of use of public transit, ride-hailing services (Uber, Lyft or taxi) and walking . 6. Duration of visit also plays a role in the mode choice of survey respondents. Those that spent less than one hour on campus had a higher proportion of public transit use, ride -hailing use and walking. In contrast, those that stayed for longer than three hours were more likely to drive alone or getting a ride from a family member or friend. 7. These findings suggest that CPMC Sutter Health visitors make rational decisions with regards to location and price of parking . Parking fees are worth paying for 1 hour, and less worth paying for more than 1 hour because there is free parking on the street. Time limits of on -street parking ensure turnover and availability for neighbors, and force CPMC Sutter Health visitors staying for more than 3 hours to park in a garage or find other alternatives. 2019 vs. 2016 Comparative Analysis The previous survey was conducted in 2016 and included four campuses - Pacific, California, St. Luke's and Davies. The three years since has been a period of consolidation for CPMC Sutter Health into fewer campuses , which included moving all functions in the California Campus and Pacific Campus to the Van Ness Campus and building of new hospital at Mission Bernal (formerly St. Luke's). Patient/Visitor Survey Summary FINAL REPORT Project #33-1999.03 WALKER CONSULTANTS | 4 Campus consol idation and location changes have likely influenced visitor transportation preferences; therefore, one goal of the analysis was to identify major trends in the 2019 survey results as compared to the 2016 survey results. 1. In comparison to the 2016 Patient/Visitor Survey results, CPMC Sutter Health has seen a marked increase in the use of ride -hailing services to get to campus (3.5% points growth) . 2. The increase has come at the expense of driving alone (4% points reduction). 3. Public transit use has seen a small reduction (1% point), which can be considered a moderate success in light of the growth of Uber and Lyft, which has negatively impacted ridership on public transit systems nationwide. 4. At the same time walking has gone up (2% points growth) , most likely due to location along major avenues and consolidation near activity centers and denser residential areas. 5. The construction of the new Van Ness and Mission Bernal Hospitals, in locations that have convenient access to regi onal transit service (subway, light rail and BRT) has resulted in increased accessibility to alternative transportation options . 6. Walking proximity to regional transit service and direct connections to BART stations via CPMC Sutter Health shuttles are provi ng effective in attracting a larger share of trips in alternative modes and further reducing patient and visitor's vehicle trips to CPMC Sutter Health campuses. 7. Results of the 2019 survey do not reflect the impact of the Van Ness M edical Office Building which started full operations in November of 2019, at the end of the survey period. 8. In the next survey period, in 2022, the Van Ness MOB and the Van Ness BRT service will be in full operation . Therefore, CPMC Sutter Health patient s and visitors will have gr eater access to the Van Ness campus on transportation modes other than driving alone. The expectation is that patients and visitors will be able to further reduce their drive alone mode share to CPMC Sutter Health campuses.

The new Van Ness Campus was developed as part of the approved Development Agreement; the Van Ness hospital opened in March 2019 . Through i ts oper ations of these medical fac ilitie s, CPMC provides a broad range of inpatient and outpatient health services, as well as direct and indire ct econ omic benefi by Sutter Health and is San Fr ancisco's third largest non-p ublic employer and fourth ov erall, with over 6,000 emplo yees. Sutter Health undertook reno vation or reconstruction of its acute -care hospitals to comply with State law (SB 1953) , which requires th at all acute-care hospitals be seismica lly upgraded so that they are operati onal after a major earth quake. Three of C PMC's four acute- care hospitals - the California, Pacifi c, and St. Luke's campuses - did not meet seismic standards and needed to be rebuilt or de- licensed in order to comply wi th this law. The Davies Campus w as retrofi tted in 2008, enabli ng thi s campus modate acute- care hospit al services until 2030 ; no construction is presently planned at that campus . To meet state l aw, CPMC consolidated a cute-care se rvices from the P acific and Cali fornia campuses i nto the new Van Ness Campus (formerly called the Cathedral Hill Camp us). The Van Ness Hospital opened in March 2019 and the associated Medical Office Building was completed in 2019. The project al so provided a ne w, seismically safe ho spital, which opened in August 2018 , to replace the old St. Luke's Hospital at the Mission Bernal Campus in the Miss ion District . Related construction, including renovation and reconfiguration of the Mission Bernal Campus, is ongoing. These constru ction proje cts have created approximately 1,500 constru ction jo bs and involve the expendi ture of over $2 bill ion in total developme nt costs. They have i ncreased the number of ear thquake- safe ho spital beds in San Francisco a nd are intended to improve heal thcare access for all San Fr anciscans. The CPMC proje ct also provides Comm unity Benefits in ad ditio n to the commit ment to rebuild St. Luke' s Hospital, incl uding a c ommunity heal th care p rogram, a transp ortation and transit p rogram, a w orkforce develop ment program, a public improveme nt program, a nd payments to provide for specific service s, program s, and infrastru cture. To guarantee these Co mmunity Benefit s, CPMC and the City e ntered into a Develop ment Agreeme nt (DA ), whi ch wa s approved by the Board of Supe rvisors in July 2013 and became effective on A ugust 10, 2013.1 Annual Revi ew Proc ess. The DA re quires an an nual review to ensure that bo th the City and CPMC are i n compli ance wi th their respective ob ligatio ns and that Co mmunity Ben efits are 1 The DA is available on the Planning Department's website at http://default.sfplanning.org/publications_reports/cpmc/cpmc_DevAgrmtFinal_exhibits.pdf . 1 being deli vered.2 As described in Section 8.2 of the DA, C PMC is required to submit an Annual Compliance Statement to the City no later than 150 days after the end of its fiscal year (currently, the calendar year). The City is then required to post CPMC's statement and receive public comment for 30 days. At the conclusion of the public comment period, the City has 45 days to publish a report on whether CPMC is in compliance with the Development Agreement. Both the Health and Planning Commissions will then hold public hearings on CPMC's compliance with a 60-day notice to the public. After these hearings, the Planning and Health Directors will forward their findings on to an independent third party monitor. The monitor will have 30 days to review the findings and evidence of CPMC' s compliance with the DA before sending a letter to the Board of Supervisors stating whether or not he or she concurs with the Directors' findings. The annual review for 2019 was affected by the public health emergency caused by the coronavirus pandemic. A ll of the reporting and review milestones outlined in the DA were delayed, and further delays may occur during the upcoming steps in the review process. The projected timeline for review of the 2019 Annual Compliance Statement is as follows: May 29, 2020 City rece ives copy of CPMC's 2019 Compliance Statement June 1, 2020 Compliance Statement posted on Planning and Public Health Departments' websites June 1, 2020 Planning Department sends notice to interested parties soliciting public comment July 1, 2020 Public comment period closes May 2 8, 2021 CPMC's 2020 Compliance Statement submitted October 7, 2021 City's Annual Report for 2019 Published ** Future Da tes Projected, Subje ct to Change** October 2021 Planning Department sends Notice of Combined 2019 and 2020 Public Hearing to interested parties October 2021 City's Annual Report for 2020 Published November 2021 Joint Health Commission and Planning Commission Hearing for 2019 and 2020 (following receipt of 2020 Compliance Statement and preparation of 2020 City Report) December 2021 Directors' findings forwarded to third party monitor January 2022 Third party monitor issues letter to Board of Supervisors 2 CPMC DA Section 8. 2 City Report . This document is the City's seventh Annual Report on CPMC's compliance ; it contains findings of compliance on each of CPMC 's and the City's obligations under the DA. Major obligations, including Sutter's performance of its healthcare and hiring com mitments, are summarized below. Healthcare Commitments Reconstruction of St. Luke's Hospital. The DA required CPMC to construct a new hospital to replace St. Luke's and to open the new hospital within 24 months after the opening of the Van Ness Campus hosp ital. With the completion of the new Mission Bernal Hospital, which opened on August 24, 2018 , earlier than required, this obligation has been met. Baseline Commitment: Medi -Cal and Charity Care. Under the DA, CPMC is required to serve at least 30,445 unduplicated Medi -Cal or Charity Care patients in San Francisco each year. CPMC served 35,456 unduplicated patients during 2019, exceeding the cumulative requirement. Baseline Commitment: Expenditures. CPMC is required to spend at least $8 million for community benefits each year. CPMC exceeded this commitment in 2019 , providing $ 13.6 million in community benefits including support for the Bayview Child Health Center. Medi -Cal Beneficiaries. Beginning with the August 2013 Effective Date of the DA, CPMC must provide hospital services for an additional 5,400 Medi -Cal beneficiaries each y ear. CPMC has consistently exceeded this goal and, as of the end of 2019 , covered 31,408 Medi -Cal managed care beneficiaries. Innovation Fund. CPMC's DA funding obligations included total payments of $8.6 million to the San Francisco Foundation to support community clinics and community -based healthcare. CPMC made the final payment in November 2017, and its obligation is complete. The San Francisco Foundation continued to use the fund make grants to local health institutions and community organizations, co nsistent with its requirements under the DA. Centers of Excellence in Community Health and Senior Health. CPMC is required to create Centers of Excellence at the St. Luke's Campus to assist patients with or at risk of chronic illnesses and to provide improved inpatient and post -hospitalization care to seniors. This obligation commenced with the opening of the new Mission Bernal hospital , and in 2018 Sutter established both required Centers of Excellence: The Center of Excelle nce in Community Health ( HealthFirst ) is a center for health education and disease prevention affiliated with St. Luke's Health Care Center. HealthFirst serves patients in chronic disease management by integrating community health workers into a mult idisciplinary health care team to provide health education, assist patients to improve their self -management skills, and encourage them to receive timely and comprehensive care. HealthFirst saw 944 unique patients in 2019 and carried out 1,982 encounters. The first quarterly community a dvisory board meeting took place 3 in October 2018; the board continued to meet in 2019 . The Center of Excellence in Senior Health is made up of the Acute Care for the Elderly (ACE) Unit, the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) , and a pilot partnership with the non- profit organization San Francisco Village. The ACE Unit at Mission Bernal Campus has 34 beds providing interdisciplinary care to older adult patients ; this unit saw 944 patients in 2019, exceeding the DA goal of approximately 600 patients . In addit ion, Sutter developed a community benefit- funded pilot partnership with S an F rancisco Village in 2018 to provide eligible discharged patients with a care navigator to help patients manage their health, prepare for doctor's visits, and gain access to needed community services to ease the transition from hospital to home. This partnership continued in 2019. Hiring Commitments The DA requires CPMC to participate in a workforce development program that includes local hiring goals for construction and certain operational activities, as well as a L ocal Business Enterprise contracting program.3 Four major projects - the new Mission Bernal Hospital, Van Ness Hospital, and the Van Ness Garage and Medical Office Building , and Medical Office Building tenant improvements - were completed before or during 2019, and Herrero Boldt, Sutter's prime contrac tor for these projects, provided final cumulative construction hiring figures as part of the 2019 compliance report. Construction Hiring. The local construction hiring goals established by the DA include: 50 percent of total non -union entry -level administrative and engineering positions. For the hiring year from August 201 9 to July 20 20, 8 2 percent (32 of 38 ) positions were filled by San Francisco residents. The final cumulative total was reported by Herrero Boldt as 83 percent. 50 percent of total entry -level administrative and engineering internship positions. For the hiring year from August 201 9 to July 20 20, 57 percent ( 30 of 53) positions were filled by San Francisco residents. Of these 30 interns, 10 were subsequently hired as full- time employees of a construction contractor on the project. Herrero Boldt reported that the final cumulative total was 61 percent. 50 percent of total union entry -level apprentice positions. For the hiring year from August 201 9 to July 20 20, the total was 30 percent, the same as the share of total positions filled in the previous three years. Sutter's contractors and the City's Workforce Division attribute the lower share to the continuing construction boom in San Francisco, which created a shortage of local workers available to fill these positions. Herrero Boldt 3 Hiring goals are reported on a fiscal y ear (July 1- June 30) basis and thus the updated 2018- 2019 figures in this City Report do not match the figures provided in the CPMC Annual Compliance Report. 4 also reported that the final cumulative total was 30 percent. CPMC has met its good - faith obligation under the DA. 30 percent of total work hours by union journeymen an d apprentices. For the hiring year from August 201 9 to July 20 20, the total was 24 percent, the same as in 2018 -2019 and a decline from the 26.25 percent share of total work hours in 2016 -2017 and 24.5 percent in 2017- 2018. As with the share of entry -level apprentice positions , the lower share of total work hours is due to the construction boom in San Francisco and consequent shortage of local workers available to fill these positions during the project construction period . Herrero Boldt reported that the final work hour total was 5,620,416 work hours, of which 1,325,455 work hours (24 percent) were performed by San Francisco residents. CPMC is generally in compliance with construction hiring goals. The DA requires good -faith efforts to meet these goals; CPMC's and its contractors' efforts to increase local hiring are described in greater detail in the Workforce tables that follow this introductory section. Ongoing and futur e projects, including demolition of the old St. Luke's Hospital and eventual construction of the new Mission Bernal Medical Office Building, will be subject to the same goals. Operational Hiring. CPMC's First Source hiring goal for entry -level operational (non- construction -related Sutter employees) is 40 percent. For the hiring year from August 201 9 to July 2020, 54 percent ( 51 of 95) entry- level hires were made through the City's First Source referral program . Local Business Enterprise Contracting. Under this program, CPMC has made payments totaling 16 percent of construction expenditures to date to qualified contractors, exceeding the DA goal of 14 percent. Payments and Funding Commitments CPMC was required to make cash payments totaling over $70 million, including endowment of a health care innovation fund and payments for affordable housing, workforce training, transportation improvements (in lieu of other transportation impact fees), and public improvements, including streetscape and pedestrian safety improvements near the Van Ness Campus. The final payments were made on November 8, 2017, and CPMC has fulfilled this obligation. Other Commitments Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Measures. The DA includes a TDM plan, which commits CPMC to reducing the proportion of employees who drive to work alone and to increasing use of public transportation, carpooling, walking, cycling, and other transportation alternatives. CPMC has initiated the progra ms required to date, including a transit pass subsidy that began in January 2017. Approximately 14 percent of employees receive the transit subsidy as of the date of this report, and about 2 4 percent of employees use transit to get work. Sutter 5 reported that the share of employees and physicians commuting in single -occupancy vehicles was 54 percent, a decline of 2 percent, during the 2019 reporting period. However, r esults of the 2019 survey d o not reflect full occupancy of the Van Ness Medical Office Building , which started full operations in November 2019 . While CPMC has generally met this obligation to date, a further reduction in single- occupant vehicle trips by both employees and visitors is needed to meet the DA goal of reduction of such trips as a share of the total (compared to 2013) by 15 percent by 2024. Mission Bernal Campus Area Improvements. The DA requires CPMC to build a number of street and pedestrian improvements around the Mission Bernal Campus, including traffic signals, street lighting, and permanent upgrades to the temporary plaza at the intersection of Guerrero Street and San Jose Avenue, south of the campus, to create a new Guerrero Park. The first set of these improvements is required to be completed at the time the plaza adjacent to the new hospital is complete, which is projected to be in 2022 . CPMC has initiated detailed design of these improvements and coordination with City agencies and has applied for the necessary permits for the park. CPMC is coordinating closely with City agencies to finalize a complete set of streetscape designs that are integrated with the surrounding neighborhood context. Areas of Concern Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS). The DA requires CPMC to deliver culturally and linguistically appropriate services that are representative of San Francisco's diverse communities at all of its campuses. In previous years, the City's annual review resulted in recommendations for substantial improvements in such services, particularly at the St. Luke's Diabetes Clinic, where the patient population has historically included many monolingual Spanish- speaking patients. In 2016, CPMC and the Department of Public Health (DPH) met and agreed on improvements needed to meet CLAS standards at St. Luke's Diabetes Clinic. These include d the addition of Spanish language staff capacity at the clinic , Spanish language classes, dedi cated reception staff, and use of the HealthFirst Program to provide connections for St. Luke's Diabetes Clinic patients. In August 2018, Sutter transferred management of the St. Luke's Diabetes Center from CPMC to the Sutter Pacific Medical Foundation (SP MF). In the 2018 joint hearing, the Health Commission encouraged CPMC to provide supplemental information (i.e. campus -specific data on patient and staff demographics, languages, payor mix, zip code, and charity care) for the Mission and Van Ness Geary Hospitals to help the City have a deeper understanding of CPMC's compliance with CLAS standards and demonstrate that the new hospitals are truly serving the communities in which they are located. CPMC reported suppleme ntal information on patient race/ethnicity, preferred language, staff demographics, and interpreter requests/wait time . Additional details are included in the healthcare tables that follow this introductory section. 6 Sub- Acute Care Services. The DA requir ed CPMC to make good -faith efforts to address the continuing decline in the availability of sub- acute care beds in San Francisco, but provision of sub- acute beds is not required under the DA and thus is not evaluated in the annual reporting process. However, the Health and Planning Commissions and the public have expressed concerns about the loss of sub- acute care beds at Sutter's CPMC facilities at previous public hearings . Sutter closed all sub- acute care beds at St. L uke's in 2018 and transferred the remaining SNF patients formerly at St. Luke's to its Davies Campus. No new sub -acute patients have been accepted since that time and no sub- acute beds were included in the Mission Bernal hospital or the Van Ness Geary hospital . In 2019, DPH convened meetings with private and public stakeholders to assess and develop strategies to address sub -acute services citywide. While CPMC participated in the se meetings and has been open to discussions on potential strategies to increase sub- acute care in the City, no additional sub -acute beds were added in 2019. 1,500 Medi -Cal Managed Care Enrollees in the Tenderloin . The DA requires CPMC to participate in a Medi -Cal managed care partnersh ip with a Tenderloin -based primary care provider to serve up to 1,500 Medi -Cal beneficiaries. In 2015, CPMC initiated a partnership with the North East Medical Services (NEMS) Management Services Organization (MSO) and St. Anthony's Medical Clinic, a primary care clinic in the Tenderloin, to have St. Anthony's join the NEMS MSO, as a pathway for CPMC to meet this commitment. CPMC is obligated to remain open to new enrollees in this partnership for the remainder of the DA or until it reaches 1,500 participants, whichever is sooner. In 2019, CPMC reports that it was the hospital partner for 4,669 unduplicated lives in the Tenderloin through the NEMS MSO. Enrollment specifically through the St. Anthony's partnership has remained stagnant over the last seve ral reporting periods, with a peak enrollment of 189 beneficiaries reported in September 2017 . As of December 2019, the membership count was 172. CPMC reported that barriers to increasing enrollment were primarily due to potential enrollees opting to receive care at other hospitals, challenges reaching individuals to complete enrollment due to outdated or incorrect contact information, and staffing shortages at St. Anthony's Clinic, which impact its ability to conduct outreach and promote the partnersh ip. Other ongoing areas of concern include community engagement in the development of CPMC's Centers for Excellence for Community Health and Senior Health. More information on this issue and progress since the 2018 compliance review is included in the detailed tables that follow this introductory section. Guerrero Park Completion . As noted above, certain aspects of the Guerrero Park design and other streetscape improvements remain to be resolved. The City and CPMC are coordinating closely to finalize desig n decisions, including the details of the permanent closure of San Jose Avenue and the southern bulbout and crosswalk. Although this DA commitment is not due until 202 2 at the earliest, the lack of resolution of these issues, together with the time needed for 7 park construction once a permit is issued, indicate that the timeline in the DA may not be reached. Once the design of the streetscape improvements is finalized, the City and CPMC could mutually agree to a limited extension to the timeline specified in the DA for this community benefit project in order to allow an appropriate construction period. Each obligation that is due under the DA is also included in this report as a separate table that indicates the following: Lead D epartme nt: The department within the Ci ty that is responsible for implementing o r overseeing the obligatio n.

In March, 2015, four grantees received grant awards from the San Francisco Foundation: Jewish Vocational Service, Mission Hiring Hall, Positive Resource Center, and Self Help for the Elderly; with grant awards beginning in April 2015. On August 17, 2015 The San Francisco Foundation released a duplicate RFP with a focus on Bayview and Western Addition communities, in which the Success Center and Young Community Developers were awarded funding to provide training and workforce services to prepare residents from their respective communities for employment at CPMC. During PY 16-17 it was decided that Mission Hiring Hall and Positive Resource Center would not continue as part of the portfolio due to continuous struggles with performance measures, and FACES SF would be awarded funding due to their high placement rates and successful collaborative efforts with CPMC. During this time the contract cycles were adjusted to mirror OEWD's fiscal year (July 1-June 30) in an effort to provide better program and outcome alignment. Contract outcomes in PY 17-18 focused on qualitative services to properly prepare residents for both clinical and non-clinical employment opportunities. Current Status: The Workforce Committee continues to meet and work with grantees to achieve our collective goals. Committee meetings occurred on the following dates: September 26 , 2019, February 7, 2020, and May 13, 2020 to d o a thorough review of performance outcomes, discuss challenges and successes with workforce programming, and strategize on how best to connect SF residents to employment at CPMC. The total amount of funding allocated to the 5 non-profit workforce partners (Jewish Vocational Services, Self-Help for the Elderly, Success Center, Code Tenderloin/Downtown Streets Team, and FACES SF) for the remaining three program years of the grant term (PY20-21, PY21-22 & PY22-23) is a cumulative of $962,106.51. During PY 19-20 Code Tenderloin via Downtown Streets Team continued to provide program support to a community anchor for employment barrier reduction, job preparedness, and placement services to low-income residents of the Civic Center, SoMA, and Tenderloin neighborhoods in San Francisco. No new RFP's were released related to this committee's work between July 1, 2019 - June 30, 2020. However, committee partners were invited to apply for the CPMC Workforce Development Fund to the San Francisco Foundation via online applications under the same parameters that were used in past RFP's similar to OEWD's RFP 121 (which was released on December 2, 2016 to provide a full array of workforce services to local residents, with a focus on sector programming, neighborhood-based workforce services, specialized population, young adult and job readiness services). In April, 2020, the Workfo rce Committee had preliminary discussions about year-end performance and discussed funding allocations. Other committee topics such as PY20-21 grantees and their funding amounts, review and confirmation of PY20-21 grantee scopes of work and their contractual outcomes were discussed during follow up correspondences as well. Contracts for the new program year will focus on job readiness training, placement assistance, paid work experience and/or barrier reduction to properly prepare residents for both clinical and non-clinical employment opportunities with competitive wages in a growing employment sector. Contracts for PY20-21 thru PY22-23 will effectively start on April 2, 2020, and scopes of work will include language re: CPMC outreach and employment services to City residents for the 5 SF Foundation workforce programming partners. Continue meetings with the Workforce Committee and with grantees in Program Year 2020-2021 Focus on job readiness training, placement assistance, paid work experience and/or barrier reduction that leads to employment opportunities with CPMC or comparable employers with competitive wages The Workforce Committee will convene in the Fall of 2020 to provide input on contractual deliverables and discuss strategies for continued program success. The Workforce Committee will continue to support grantees to ensure that training and employment services are meeting the workforce needs of San Franciscans. Code Tenderloin and the Downtown Streets Team will continue to strengthen job readiness and employment services for Tenderloin residents to engage and support the community. CPMC, in coordination with OEWD's Business Services Team will continue to schedule neighborhood based Employer Spotlights and Hiring Events citywide.

The Contractor along with its Subcontractors and their applicable unions will confirm the number of new union apprentices that will be required for the Contract and the annual variability of that demand throughout the course of the Contract. The methodology to be used to estimate the number of new union apprentices shall be 21% of the projected number of apprentice hours overall. As of July 1, 2020, CPMC's Contractors have filled 30% of new Entry Level Positions for union apprentice candidates with System Referrals. Although that is below the 50% Entry-Level union apprentice hiring goal, HerreroBOLDT and their contractors have made ongoing efforts to hire System Referrals when possible and demonstrated their good-faith by notifying CityBuild of all new hiring opportunities.

CPMC is contracted with one MSO, North East Medical Services, and worked with NEMS and St. Anthony's Clinic, a primary care provider in the Tenderloin, to have St. Anthony's join the NEMS MSO. Thus, through forging this new partnership CPMC is the hospital partner for one of St. Anthony's participating medical groups and will work with them to grow enrollment to 1,500 members. CPMC continues to work with St. Anthony's leadership to develop a path to sustainability and support outreach efforts, funded through the Healthcare Innovation Fund.

CPMC would suggest that this figure be corrected for future reference. The 14,850 figure referenced in the Development Agreement double counts Healthy Families members-- including Healthy Families as a separate count and as part of the Medi-Cal enrollees. This clerical correction does not affect CPMC's New Medi-Cal Beneficiaries Commitment, which remains at 5,400.1 8/10/2013 indicates commitments on the Development Agreement Effective Date 11/8/2013 indicates commencement on the date Approvals were Finally Granted EXHIBIT A This letter is intended solely for the information and internal use of Sutter Health, and is not intended to be and should no t be used by any other person or entity.

At your request, we performed an assessment between March 31 and May 21, 2020, of the unduplicated patients to be reported by CPMC to the City of San Francisco related to the entitlement CPMC has with the City of San Francisco to build a new hospital on the CPMC campus. This assessment of unduplicated patients, as defined in the agreement between CPMC and the City of San Francisco, included evaluating whether the number of unduplicated patients treated at the following CPMC campuses: Van Ness, California, Davies, Pacific and Mission Bernal (formerly St. Luke's ), from the period of January 1st, 2020 to December 31st, 2020, reasonably represents and are supported by CPMC's Patient Accounting records. Our procedures included the following: Advisor conducted interviews with business managers to understand the process and calculations of unduplicated patients to identify Medi -Cal and Charity Care patients and consider whether the process is consistent with the prior year and as previously understood by Advisor. Advisor obtained from CPMC the patient details from the period for Medi -Cal and Charity Care patients and performed data analytics on the received data to determine the number of unduplicated Medi -Cal and Charity Care patients. Advisor performed data analysis on the unduplicated patient listings, starting with raw data extracted from the patient accounting system, to evaluate whether duplicate patients are included in the listings for calendar year 2020. Advisor selected a random sample of 25 patients from calendar year 2020 and evaluated supporting documentation provided by CPMC that supports CPMC's classification of the patient as a Medi -Cal or Charity Care recipient. Advisor's methodology used in the procedures were consistent with those used in the review of the periods for calendar years 2009 through 2019. This letter is intended solely for the information and internal use of Sutter Health, and is not intended to be and should no t be used by any other person or entity. No other person or entity is entitled to rely, in any manner, or for any purpose, on this letter. CPMC is subject under the Development Agreement to an \"Unduplicated Patient Commitment\" of 30,446 Unduplicated Patients (as defined.) This amount is not to include utilization attributable to the 5,400 additional \"New Beneficiaries Commitment.\" It is our understanding that CPMC and the City of San Francisco have agreed to an adjustment of 837 unduplicated patients as the number necessary to exclude the utilization of the 5,400 additional Medi -Cal managed care enrollees from the commitment. Based on the procedures performed above, the total unduplicated patient count is 29,737. With the subtraction of the agreed 837 unduplicated patients, the allowable number of unduplicated patients for 2020 is 28,900, representing a deficit of 1,549 for 20 20. This net unduplicated patient count developed by CPMC appears reasonable based upon the procedures performed and reflects the number of Medi -Cal and Charity Care patients treated the period of January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 at the Van Ness, California, Davies, Pacific and Mission Bernal campuses of CPMC as reflected in the CPMC Patient Accounting records. ********************** Advisor did not make any management decisions, perform any management functions, or assume any management responsibilities.

Very truly yours, Deloitte & Touche LLP By: Karolyn Woo Princip al EXHIBIT C Finance Policy DRAFT POLICY DATE 11/18//28/2015 Effective Date: Area: Finance References: POLICY ON FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE (CHARITY CARE) PURPOSE The purpose of the policy is to provide patients with information on the Financial Assistance (Charity Care) available at Sutter Health hospital facilities and to outline the process for determining eligibility for Financial Assistance. POLICY It is the policy of Sutter Health to provide patients with understandable written information regarding Financial Assistance to provide income-based Financial Assistance (Charity Care) to qualified patients. SCOPE This policy applies to all licensed hospital facilities operated by Sutter Health or an Affiliated Entity (as that term is defined in the bylaws of Sutter Health), and all other hospitals in which Sutter Health and/or an Affiliated Entity has a direct or indirect voting control or equity interest of greater than 50% (hereafter referred to as \"Hospital\" or \"Sutter Health Hospitals\" (as listed in Appendix G). Unless otherwise specified, this policy does not apply to physicians or other medical providers, including emergency room physicians, anesthesiologists, radiologists, hospitalists, pathologists, etc., whose services are not included in a Hospital's bill. This policy does not create an obligation for the Hospital to pay for such physicians' or other medical providers' services. In California, an emergen cy physician who provides emergency services in a hospital is required to provide discounts to uninsured patients or patients with high medical costs who are at or below 350 percent of the federal poverty level. DEFINITIONS Complex/Specialized Services : \"Complex/Specialized Services\" are services that Sutter Health or a Hospital determines are complex and specialized (e.g., transplants, experimental and investigational services) as well as certain elective services that are typically excluded from coverage under health plan coverage agreements (e.g., cosmetic procedures). Federal Poverty Level (FPL) : The \"Federal Poverty Level\" of \"FPL\" is the measure of income level that is published annually by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is used by Hospitals for determining eligibility for Financial Assistance. Financial Assistance : \"Financial Assistance\" refers to Full Charity Care and High Medical Cost Charity Care (as outlined in section A.1 Eligibility). {00711610 v.14} 14-294 Hospital Services: \"Hospital Services\" are all services that a Hospital is licensed to provide, including emergency and other medically necessary care (excluding Complex/Specialized Services ). Primary Language of Hospital's Service Area : A \"Primary Language of Hospital's Service Area\" is a language used by the lesser of 1,000 people or 5% of the community served by the Hospital based upon the most recent Community Health Needs Assessment performed by Hospital. Uninsured Patient: An \"Uninsured Patient\" is a patient who has no third -party source of payment for any portion of their medical expenses, including without limitation, commercial or other insurance, government sponsored healthcare benefit programs, or third party liability, and includes a patient whose benefits under all potential sources of payment have been exhausted prior to an admission. Insured Patient : An \"Insured Patient\" is a patient who has a third -party source of payment for a portion of their medical expenses, but excludes patients who are covered by Medi-Cal. Patient Responsibility : \"Patient Responsibility\" is the amount that an Insured Patient is responsible to pay out- of-pocket after the patient's third -party coverage has determined the amount of the patient's benefits. PROCEDURES A. ELIGIBILITY 1. Eligibility Criteria: During the application process set forth in sections B and C below, Hospitals shall apply the following eligibility criteria for Financial Assistance: Financial Assistance Category Patient Eligibility Criteria Available Discount FULL CHARITY CARE Patient is an Uninsured Patient with a Family Income (as defined below) at or below 400% of the most recent FPL Full write off of all charges for Hospital Services HIGH MEDICAL COST CHARITY CARE (for Insured Patients) 1. Patient is an Insured Patient with a Family Income (as defined below) at or below 400% of the most recent FPL; and 2. Medical expenses for themselves or their family (incurred at the Hospital or paid to other providers in the past 12 months) exceed 10% of the patient's Family Income. A write off of the Patient Responsibility amount for Hospital Services {00711610 v.14} 14-294 2. Calculating Family Income : To determine a patient's eligibility for Financial Assistance, the Hospital shall first calculate the patient's Family Income, as follows: a) Patient Family: The Patient Family shall be determined as follows: (i) Adult Patients: For patients over 18 years of age, the Patient Family includes their spouse, domestic partner, and dependent children less than 21 years of age, whether living at home or not. (ii) Minor Patients: For patients under 18 years of age, the Patient Family includes their parents, caretaker relatives, and other children less than 21 years of age of the parent(s) or caretaker relatives. b) Proof of Family Income: Patient shall only be required to provide recent pay stubs or tax returns as proof of income. Family Income is annual earnings of all members of the Patient Family from the prior 12 months or prior tax year as shown by the recent pay stubs or income tax returns, less payments made for alimony and child support. Income included in this calculation is every form of income, e.g., salaries and wages, retirement income, near cash government transfers like food stamps, and investment gains. Annual income may be determined by annualizing year- to-date Family Income. Sutter may validate income by using external presumptive eligibility service providers. provided that such service only determines eligibility using only information permitted by this policy. c) Calculating Family Income for Expired Patients: Expired patients, with no surviving spouse, may be deemed to have no income for purposes of calculation of Family Income. Documentation of income is not required for expired patients; however, documentation of estate assets may be required. The surviving spouse of an expired patient may apply for Financial Assistance 3. Calculating Family Income as a Percentage of FPL: After determining Family Income, Hospital shall calculate the Family Income level in comparison to the FPL, expressed as a percentage of the FPL. For example, if the federal poverty level for a family of three is $20,000, and a patient's Family Income is $60,000, the Hospital shall calculate the patient's Fami ly Income to be 300% of the FPL. Hospitals shall use this calculation during the application process to determine whether a patient meets the income criteria for Financial Assistance. 4. Special Circumstance - Benefits Exhausted During Inpatient Stay: When an Insured Patient's third -party coverage pays only a portion of the expected reimbursement for the patient's stay because the patient exhausted their benefits during the stay, the Hospital should collect from the patient the balance of the expected reimbursement that would have been due from the third-party coverage if the benefits were not exhausted. A Hospital shall not pursue from the patient any amount in excess of the amount that would have been due from the third-party coverage if the benefits were not exhausted, plus the patient's share of cost or co -insurance. A patient who exceeded their benefit cap during a stay is eligible to apply for Financial Assistance. If the patient is eligible for Financial Assistance, the Hospital shall write off all charges for services that the Hospital provided after the patient exceeded the benefit cap. 5. Financial Assistance Exclusions/Disqualification: The following are circumstances in which Financial Assistance is not available under this policy: {00711610 v.14} 14-294 a) Uninsured Patient seeks Complex/Specialized Services: Generally, Uninsured Patients who seek Complex/Specialized services (e.g. transplants, experimental or investigational procedures), and seek to receive Financial Assistance for such services, must receive administrative approval from the individual responsible for finance at the Hospital (or designee) prior to the provision of such services in order to be eligible for Financial Assistance. Hospitals shall develop a process for patients to seek prior administrative approval for services that require such approval. Elective services that are normally exclusions from coverage under health plan coverage agreements (e.g., cosmetic procedures) are not eligible for Financial Assistance. b) Medi-Cal Patients with Share of Cost: Medi-Cal patients who are responsible to pay share of cost are not eligible to apply for Financial Assistance to reduce the amount of Share of Cost owed. Hospitals shall seek to collect these amounts from the patients. c) Patient declines covered services: An Insured Patient who elects to seek services that are not covered under the patient's benefit agreement (such as an HMO patient who seeks out- of-network services from Sutter, or a patient refuses to transfer from a Sutter hospital to an in-network facility) is not eligible for Financial Assistance d) Insured Patient does not cooperate with third-party payer: An Insured Patient who is insured by a third-party payer that refuses to pay for services because the patient failed to provide information to the third-party payer necessary to determine the third- party payer's liability is not eligible for Financial Assistance. e) Payer pays patient directly: If a patient receives payment for services directly from an indemnity, Medicare Supplement, or other payer, the patient is not eligible for Financial Assistance for the services. f) Information falsification: Hospitals may refuse to award Financial Assistance to patients who falsify information regarding Family Income, household size or other information in their eligibility application. g) Third party recoveries: If the patient receives a financial settlement or judgment from a third- party tortfeasor that caused the patient's injury, the patient must use the settlement or judgment amount to satisfy any patient account balances, and is not eligible for Financial Assistance. h) Professional (physician) Services: Services of physicians such as anesthesiologists, radiologists, hospitalists, pathologists, etc. are not covered under this policy. Any exceptions are set forth in Exhibit A. Many physicians have charity care policies that allow patients to apply for free or discounted care. Patients should obtain information about a physician's charity care policy directly from their physician. B. APPLICATION PROC ESS 1. Each Hospital shall make all reasonable efforts to obtain from the patient or his or her representative information about whether private or public health insurance may fully or partially cover the charges for care rendered by the Hospital to a patient. A patient who indicates at any time the financial inability to pay a bill for Hospital Services shall be {00711610 v.14} 14-294 evaluated for Financial Assistance. In order to qualify as an Uninsured Patient, the patient or the patient's guarantor must verify that he or she is not aware of any right to insurance or government program benefits that would cover or discount the bill.

The Hospital will consider each applicant's Application for Financial Assistance and grant Financial Assistance when the patient meets the eligibility criteria set forth in section A.1 and has received (or will receive) Hospital Service(s). 2.

Once a Full Charity Care or High Medical Cost Charity Care determination has been made, a \"Notification Form\" ( Exhibit D) will be sent to each applicant advising them of the Hospital's decision. 4. Patients are presumed to be eligible for Financial Assistance for a period of one year after the Hospital issues the Notification Form to the patient. After one year, patients must re-apply for Financial Assistance. 5. If the Financial Assistance determination creates a credit balance in favor of a patient, the refund of the credit balance shall include interest on the amount of the overpayment from the date of the patient's payment at the statutory rate (10% per annum) pursuant to Health and Safety Code section 127440, provided that Hospitals are not required to refund a credit balance that is, together with interest, less than five dollars ($5). {00711610 v.14} 14-294 D.

COMMUNITY HEALTH INNOVATION FUND Sutter West Bay Hospitals, a California nonprofit corporation doing business as California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC), entered into a development agreement with the City and County of San Francisco related to the construction of CPMC's medical facilities. In July 2013, representatives from CPMC's Community Health Programs, San Francisco Department of Public Health, and The San Francisco Foundation (TSFF) formed a Committee to oversee the strategy for granting $8,600,000 of the Community Health Innovation Fund monies. To date, The San Francisco Foundation has received six payments totaling $8,600,000. 2013 Grants The first round of grants was awarded to organizations focused on 1) Affordable Care Act reform readiness for community clinics; 2) strategic opportunities to improve services to people with HIV/AIDS; and 3) expansion of comprehensive mental health services in San Francisco. The grants were made to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation ($465,000), Curry Senior Center ($185,000), Mission Neighborhood Health Center ($128,700), and San Francisco Community Clinic Consortium ($186,000). 2013 Outcomes The grant supported the construction of the San Francisco AIDS Foundation new site. SFAF opened the doors of its new facility in 2016 and is in the process of completing the OSHA requirements necessary to relocate their clinical services. The new, 14,700 square- foot, three-story building will enable The AIDS Foundation to expand case management services by 25%, mental health counseling by 25%, substance use and harm reduction counseling by 50%, and HIV and STI screening up to 40%. Curry Senior Center successfully completed organizational requirements for compliance, which resulted in their ability to be certified for Medicare reimbursement. They were also able to expand their diabetes educational services, hire a Spanish- speaking Health Coach, and provide Aftercare Group Sessions on self-care. Funding allowed Mission Neighborhood Health Center and the SF Community Clinic Consortium to conduct a financial assessment and business planning process to test the feasibility of the Clinic Consortium to create an Independent Practice Association as a strategy to maximize reimbursement rates under the new ACA. The Clinic Consortium also provided training to over 120 clinic staff on ACA, enrollment and eligibility regulations, and alternative payment methodologies. Clinic staff in turn, enrolled thousands of San Francisco patients into Healthy San Francisco, Medicare, Medi-Cal, and Covered California. 2014 Grants In 2014, two-year grants were awarded to nine community-based clinics to enhance care coordination with the goal of reducing re-hospitalization rates for high risk patients. Each of the following clinics received $220,588 totaling $1,985,292: HealthRight 360, Glide Foundation, Lyon-Martin Women's Health Services, Mission Neighborhood Health Center, Native American Health Center, North East Medical Services, St. Anthony Foundation, SF Medical Center Outpatient Clinic, and the Women's Community Clinic. HR360 received an additional $25,000 to provide technical assistance to align Coordinated Care Protocols for all clinic partners. Funds were also allocated to the Progress Foundation ($280,000) to establish a stronger partnership with the San Francisco Police Department to transport homeless individuals suffering from mental illness to Dore Urgent Care Clinic, a community-based health and mental health treatment facility rather than to private and public hospital emergency rooms. 2014 Outcomes The Progress Foundation was able to hire additional staff to expand to 24-hour care and establish a stronger partnership with the San Francisco Police Department regarding transport of homeless and mentally ill patients. The number of clients who received immediate clinical treatment increased by 90%. First year results from HealthRight360, Glide Foundation, Lyon-Martin Women's Health Services, Mission Neighborhood Health Center, Native American Health Center, North East Medical Services, St. Anthony Foundation, SF Medical Center Outpatient Clinic and the Women's Community Clinic reported utilization of funds to hire additional staff to improve their data management systems and to provide targeted outreach and follow-up for patients discharged from hospitals and the emergency room. An average of 75% of patients identified as hospital discharge patients and 70% of emergency room patients were contacted following their release for follow-up appointments within 7 days. Some clinics reported up to 95% of known hospital discharges were contacted and 94% of known emergency room discharges contacted within the seven day timeframe. The funding also required improvement of their response time to non-scheduled patient referrals to be opened and reviewed within 10 days. The majority of clinics reported an improved time response rate of 99%. In general, the grant reports reflect significant improvements from prior years of operation. The clinics continue to work towards achieving \"clean and updated\" data as cost efficiently as possible and also continue their efforts to reconcile the limitations of the Lifetime Clinical Report (software platform utilized by SF General and some hospital systems) to receive timely notification on hospitalization and emergency room visits of clinic patients. The majority of clinics have hired Referral and Care Coordinators or Nurse Case Managers who can provide the \"high-touch\" needed to insure clinic patients adhere to their appointments. One clinic reported that of the 1,483 referrals initiated between January-March, only 4% were no-shows, a dramatic improvement from prior reports. Funding has allowed clinics to utilize technology and pioneer innovative strategies. Two clinics (St. Anthony's Foundation and North East Medical Services) have instituted a Home Visitation program for patients identified as high risk and who face logistical and social barriers to meeting their appointments. St. Anthony's Foundation is employing virtual consultations with their physician using Apple's FaceTime. In addition, St. Anthony's has instituted Care Messaging to all of its patients. A consistent challenge cited by the majority of clinics is in the recruitment, hiring and retention of qualified staff to provide Care Coordination largely due to the low salary structure and high cost of living in the Bay Area. The final reports for this set of grants will be submitted by the clinics in early July, 2017. 2015 Grants In 2015, the Community Health Innovation Fund Committee identified the need for direct funding to community-based organizations focused on mental health services for high- risk populations and improved quality of life for low-income seniors. Grants were made to the following organizations: Bayview-Hunter's Point Multipurpose Senior Services : to increase access to mental health services for vulnerable seniors and adults with disabilities in low-income, underserved communities through piloting a Community-Based Health Home ($150,000) and to build operational capacity for the Senior Ex-Offender Program to provide expanded services to aging formerly incarcerated African American males. ($100,000) Stepping Stone Senior Services : to increase access to Mental Health Services for vulnerable Seniors and Adults with Disabilities in underserved communities through a pilot of the Community-Based Home Health model. ($150,000) Central City Hospitality House : to support the Community Building Program to ameliorate the negative impact of trauma exposure on community and CCHH staff members by increasing access to a range of mental health and support services. ($150,000) Westside Mental Health Services : to provide African American low and moderate- income children, youth, and families with culturally based mental health services including healing circles and linkages to outpatient and primary care treatment that will help them take control of their recovery and healing from mental illness, substance abuse, violence, racism, and trauma. ($90,000) St. Anthony Foundation : to support infrastructure needs to increase the delivery of comprehensive, high quality healthcare services at no cost to low-income residents of San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood. ($420,000) Progress Foundation : to sustain their 24-hour clinical services and to align their billing system to capture MediCal reimbursement for mental health services. ($72,000) 2015 Outcomes Over the course of their grant, Bayview-Hunters Point Multipurpose Senior Services and Stepping Stone Senior Services each identified 10-15 seniors, targeting formerly homeless with mental health diagnosis or living alone without existing social support. The target population utilized the Emergency Room as their primary source of care. Both organizations hired a RN Navigator who addressed immediate crises, provided health/mental health assessment and education, medication management, accompaniment to health appointments, follow-up care and referral for specialty services. Results point to improved health, mental health, and reduction in ER visits and hospitalizations when compared with the baseline data that was collected. Of 17 seniors enrolled in the Bayview-Hunters Point MSSP project, eight participated in weekly professional counseling sessions resulting in improvement in their quality of life and decreased depression and isolation. The funding also supported participation by both agencies in a State cohort of senior service organizations working to design an Adult Day Healthcare/Community-Based Health Home model. Continued funding support for both projects was a major challenge. Both organizations cited the passage of the City's Prop I (Dignity Fund), would provide a funding stream to sustain the service, however, in the case of Stepping Stone , funds were not available to continue the program. Bayview-Hunters Point Multipurpose Senior Services also received funds to strengthen their Senior Ex-Offender Program. Funds for dedicated staff time allowed them to purchase 1768 Newcomb for $1.6 million and to raise $80,000 from new funding sources. The building (old police station) will allow them to provide transitional housing for14 formerly incarcerated and homeless residents. This project will be supported by funds from the SF Department of Probation. Central City Hospitality House exceeded their goal of providing 16 community events (goal was four) focused on violence prevention, increasing community cohesion and ability to respond to and recover from trauma. The events engaged 345 community members (goal was 150). In addition, 80 participants were assessed and referred to behavioral health services. \"Talking Tech in the Tenderloin\" provided a discussion series between tech company representatives and community members addressing displacement and workforce needs. CCHH also provided two 17-week sessions on Healing, Organizing and Leadership Development for 16 interns (Peer Advocates). Training graduates stated that the sessions reduced isolation, helped them develop new leadership skills, and increased social connection to the Tenderloin community. Through the Harm Reduction Therapy Center, therapists provided services to 84 participants of which 77% maintained sufficient engagement to achieve at least one Wellness goal. For CCHH staff who experienced an increased level of crisis and trauma over the prior year, funds were used to engage Blooming Willow Coaching which brought together a team of over 30 Bay Area coaches, therapists and trainers to provide individual wellness coaching and skills building workshops. The evaluation survey found that 92% reported having built new skills to support their navigation of unsafe and stressful environments at the workplace and 92% increased skills in supporting their peers. Blooming Willow established a Culture Keepers Committee, a peer-based wellness support group within the agency to sustain the gains made in improving staff cohesion and morale. Having built staff cohesion, the agency was able to move forward on the implementation of their new theory of change and commitment to their mission. Westside Community Services provided 196 culturally-based healing circles to over 164 community residents who were suffering from trauma-inflicted depression and other psychoses. Though falling short of their goal of engaging 400 participants, the project cited success in bringing first responder survivors of violence to address their own self- care. The grant also supported training of Healing Circle Facilitators (community leaders/residents) trained by the Bay Area Association of Black Psychologists and the Copeland Center's Wellness Recovery Action Planning. Facilitators received the Community Inclusion Peer Facilitator Certification. Healing Circles were provided to targeted populations: Women in Recovery, People Living with HIV, Ajani Youth, Westside Man Up Project (formerly incarcerated African American men), and parents of murdered children. Eighty-seven percent (87%) reported positive outcomes and improvement in their mental health and a decrease of negative impacts of trauma. The grant allowed Westside Community Services to provide the rationale for culturally based healing circles as a valid treatment protocol. The services have continued with a grant from the Office of Children, Youth and their Families. The healing circles have been built in as a component of a larger collaborative of nine African American partner agencies working to provide comprehensive care for high-risk African American youth and their families. St. Anthony Foundation received a two-year grant to help meet the system requirements as a new Federally Qualified Health Center. With these funds, they have been able to enroll 500 new patients, design and implement a sliding fee scale, and hire a new Clinical Social Worker to address the complex health and mental health needs of patients. They are working to connect patients being discharged from homeless shelters by providing transportation support (Uber, Lyft) to attend medical appointments. The clinic currently has 300 Medi-Cal managed patients waiting assignment to a provider network. In Year 2 of their grant (2017) they will need to fully implement the HRSA Program Requirements and accounting systems as well as strengthen their outreach to high risk patients. Funding to keep the Progress Foundation's Dore Urgent Care Clinic open everyday for 24 hours increased referrals from SFPD by 56% and reduced referrals to SFGH Psychiatric Emergency Services (PES) resulting in a 50% drop in \"Red Alert Days\" where PES was challenged with the large number of incoming patients and limited medical staff. There was also a significant reduction in the number of individuals transported to private hospital emergency rooms. The Progress Foundation Urgent Care Clinic was instrumental as a model and in providing data in the passage of SB 82 establishing a funding source for community-based psychiatric clinics in other counties. 2016 Grants Drug Policy Alliance : to support planning and implementation of a multi-departmental pre-booking diversion program that will reduce incarceration and increase access to health and mental health services for SF high risk populations and to complete a proposal for $5.9 million in funding from the California Board of State and Community Corrections. ($250,000 over 12 months) Central City Hospitality House : to support and train peer health volunteers, staff, and outreach teams to enhance their ability to engage other community members, leading to a healthier neighborhood with people seeing themselves as part of the solution. ($500,000 over 2 years) North of Market Tenderloin Community Benefit Corporation : to improve the stability, livability and sustainability of the Tenderloin through the Tenderloin Community Benefit Corporation Healthy Neighborhood Initiative. ($150,000 over 24 months) Public Health Foundation Enterprises : to reduce unnecessary use of hospital emergency room services by providing transportation to the Sobering Center. ($35,000 over 12 months) 2016 Outcomes Drug Policy Alliance has completed the planning and implementation of a multi- departmental pre-booking diversion program to reduce the recidivism rate for drug and alcohol offenders and strengthened collaboration across city departments with community-based organizations. An MOU was established delineating shared principles and identified roles and responsibilities of each of the participating organizations (Department of Public Health, Police Department, District Attorney, Public Defender, Sheriff's Department, BART Police, Sentencing Commission, Adult Probation, Glide Foundation, Fenton Institute and the Drug Policy Alliance). To date, the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion or LEAD is operating in the Tenderloin/Civic Center and Mission neighborhoods. For each neighborhood, a team of law enforcement officers and a complementary team of social service providers, including outreach workers and case managers, work to provide assistance to high-risk individuals referred by SFPD and BART Police. As of March 2018, 62 individuals have been referred for services. The goal of the program is to serve 250 individuals over the next 2 years. This grant also provided support to submit a proposal for $5.9million to the California Board of State and Community Corrections on behalf of the City. The City was awarded the full $5.9 million and scored the highest of all applications received. Central City Hospitality House has completed 12 months of their 24-month grant. This grant will end on June 30, 2019. They have made significant progress in reaching their 3 primary outcomes by hiring a Training & Volunteer Coordinator and Deputy Director of Programs. Funding also continues to provide peer staff support and training that has resulted in an increased level of services to community residents. The increased level of coaching support for staff has resulted in a reduction of police involvement and increased staff's capacity to identify, intervene and de-escalate potential crisis situations. In the first year, over 75 volunteers enrolled in 38 trainings contributing 2,500 service hours in one or more of the agency's six programs. Additionally, 140 community members (their goal was 75) have participated in community-building activities including neighborhood forums on public safety, gentrification and voter education. Ten peer staff (formerly homeless) was promoted (goal was 3 staff) within the agency and agency partnerships strengthened with the Tenderloin CBD and Mayor's Office of Civic Engagement multi- neighborhood ambassadors. Funding has strengthened their capacity to offer joint training activities, team meetings and develop one-on-one support. Twenty-one in-service trainings have been provided (goal was 12) on harm reduction techniques, client engagement, conflict prevention/de- escalation, resource referrals, etc. with 105 individuals participating in at least 1 training and 70 participated in multiple trainings. More activities are planned for the second year. North of Market Tenderloin Community Benefit Corporation (NMTCBC) In their 1st year report (of a 2-year grant) NMTCBC completed their strategic plan to guide them to 2020 and they are now in the process of an Executive search that they hope to complete by mid-2018. Staff has expanded from 2 part-time to 3 full-time positions. They have moved to a storefront office on Ellis Street to be more accessible to the Tenderloin community. Half of the new office space is designed as a community meeting place. NMTCBC has hosted over 20 meetings during the grant period. They successfully negotiated a new street cleaning contract with a new vendor reducing cost by $185,000. The new vendor (Downtown Streets Team) provides an employment path for homeless individuals. Assessment rates have increased and cleaning costs reduced creating an income stream to support the new program staff. The fundraising goal was $325,000. The actual amount raised through grants and earned income was $651,500. The Safe Senior program is in place. Over 26,000 seniors and 17,945 children were assisted with safe street crossings in the first year. Six Safe Senior Ambassadors have been hired. The Safe Route to School program is in the pilot stage. Neighborhood improvements are more visible, 70 positive street banners have been installed and over 100 residents have participated in each of their community meetings. Public Health Foundation Enterprises - Sobering Center This grant provided critical transportation services to divert individuals from hospital emergency rooms to the Sobering Center where they are offered additional services to promote medical detoxification, recovery and case management. Funds allowed the Center and its services to be open 24 hours a day. During the 2016-17 fiscal year, the Center received 1,125 total calls for transport, 981calls were made from emergency rooms and 144 from shelters, clinics, treatment programs. The Center anticipates the numbers will increase in FY 2017-18. 2017 Grants Reports for 2017 grants are not due until July 2018, therefore progress on the grants mentioned below will appear in the May 2019 report. Public Health Foundation-Sobering Center Transport : to provide interim support to maintain transport services. ($150,000 one year) St. Anthony's Foundation : to increase part-time Outreach Worker position to full-time to increase patient referral to their clinic. ($35,000 one year) Central City Hospitality House : to support housing placement, case management, and leadership development of Tenderloin residents to advocate for improved living conditions and access to services. ($167,000 one year) Garden 2 Table : to support the Camelot Green Kitchen project and cultural events to promote healthy living for SRO residents in the Tenderloin community. ($125,000 one year) Neighborhood Empowerment Network : to engage Bayview community agencies and residents in a community planning process to ensure the health and safety of residents. ($150,000 one year) Women's Community Clinic : to provide infrastructure support for updated financial and patient tracking software and staff time to complete the merger with HR360. ($50,000 one year) 2017 Grant Outcomes St. Anthony's Foundation (SAMC) - $35,000 to support outreach and care coordination. Funding supported part-time staff to provide outreach to increase patient enrollment and establish protocol and a system for follow-up care. Of their goal to provide contact within 7 days of discharge from an inpatient hospital stay, SAMC was able to reach 65% percent of patients, short of their 100% target. However, they were able to determine that their patient records were incomplete or incorrect for the 35% who did not receive contact. To address this, they worked in partnership with the ER nurses at discharge to insure patient information was updated and correct. They also allocated staff time to scrub existing data and update PCP and LCR data. Their efforts to reduce 30-day re- hospitalization rates realized higher outcomes (80%). One hundred percent of non- scheduled referrals to SAMC were opened and reviewed within 10 days due primarily to the new Referral Care Coordinator and increased use of the \"e-referral\". SAMC is piloting expanded weekday-afternoon office hours and evaluating the benefit/cost of providing Saturday service. SAMC has expanded patient-visit reviews to include orientation/education regarding services appropriate for SAMC versus hospitals, the use of the After-Hours Pager System and use of SF Health Plan's/Blue Cross 24-Hour Advice Nurse Hotline. SAMC has decreased its appointment no-show rate from 25% to 10% over the grant period. Funding supported improvements in workflow processes, better use of EMR, and new technologies such as the \"Call Point\" appointment reminder system thus increasing efficiencies in both administrative and medical care. Central City Hospitality House - $167,000 to support housing placement, case management and leadership development of Tenderloin residents to advocate for improved living conditions and access to services. CCHH exceeded all of their grant goals to provide services to formerly homeless individuals in the Tenderloin. Of their original goal of assessing 80 CCHH participants, 92 individuals were assessed by Community Building Program case managers (many of whom were formerly homeless) for improved housing opportunities, eligibility for public benefits and referrals to behavioral and physical health resources. In addition, their goal of maintaining housing placement for 75 participants was exceeded by serving a total of 110 individuals. Of these, 100% maintained or improved their housing without re- experiencing homelessness during the course of the year. Eighty-two participants were referred for behavioral or physical health needs, and 80 residents completed a case plan identifying goals, time frame for completion, and documented accomplishment of agreed- upon goals. For their Healing, Organizing, Leadership Development (HOLD) training project, 21 community residents enrolled (goal was 8) and 14 demonstrated improved leadership skills through a civic engagement activity (goal was 4). Graduates of the program return to lead one or more information workshops focused on effects of psychological trauma all of who have had direct experience with trauma. Close to 300 community residents participated in at least 1 of 13 community events which included Poetry and Spoken Word nights, monthly sidewalk activation events, neighborhood forums on community issues and a workshop on \"City Hall Works For You\" co-hosted by the Clerk of the Board of Supervisors and held in the Board Chamber at City Hall. For many, this was their first exposure to City procedures and first time in City Hall. These series of events reduced isolation and further strengthened connection between community residents. The HOLD (leadership development) model of trauma-informed leadership is regarded as an innovative model and has been adopted by several of their partner organizations. The HOLD training project resulted in an organizational transformation as well. Four members of CCHH's Board of Directors are graduates of HOLD, thus furthering their vision for a truly community-led organization. From Garden to Table (FGTT) - $125,000 to establish a safer cooking system and cooking instruction to promote better health outcomes for SRO residents in the Tenderloin. FGTT's goal is to promote recovery from substance abuse and the trauma of homelessness by providing cooking lessons promoting healthy foods and providing access to in-home cooking equipment designed to promote safety for SRO residents in the Tenderloin community. FGTT partnered with the Auburn Hotel, a 70-unit permanent supportive housing site for previously homeless veterans. Each unit was only equipped with a mini-refrigerator and microwave. The units did not include cooking facilities though the residents requested safe and clean cooking facilities for meal preparation. FGTT provided a fully equipped, environmentally safe cooking system to 13 participants who completed the onsite 6-week class. The Auburn graduates prepared food for 31 managers of other SROs and community representatives. In addition to classes at the Auburn, FGTT completed a total of 122 health, cooking and physical activity classes, 3 Safety and Prevention Exchange Project graduations, and 10 community events. Participation totaled 1,295 Tenderloin residents, managers and community organizers. FGTT in partnership with the San Francisco Recovery Theatre met with 6 Tenderloin SRO managers (Auburn, Cova Cadillac, Camelot, Windsor, and Jefferson hotels) to develop collaborative relationships. In total, FGTT met, networked and participated in meetings with 120 stakeholders and SRO managers. FGTT staff also participated in the San Francisco Food Security Task Force and partnered with the Saint Francis Foundation to strategize reaching more Tenderloin SROs to provide safe and healthy cooking systems. To address concerns regarding sustainability of the project, FGTT has submitted proposals to 11 foundations and created a crowd-funding platform. Women's Community Clinic - $50,000 to support completion of the merger with HealthRIGHT360. The determination whether to move forward with the merger was completed on time with both agencies providing documentation and conducting due diligence. The two organizations' Board of Directors and Leadership teams entered into agreement in April 2017. High Board and staff satisfaction remained a priority throughout the merger process and board and staff retreats have fostered a stronger sense of unity and commitment to the Clinic's mission. A gap analysis review for FQHC compliance was completed and a remediation plan to address gaps was put in place. However, WCC did not get approval for their own FQHC status. HealthRIGHT 360 was recently awarded FQHC-lookalike status that fully complies with the requirements of Section 330. To address sustainability, a business plan and financial model was completed in June 2017 that highlighted the need to increase patient enrollment, convert offices to clinic space, and increase clinic staff time to see more patients. To insure continuity of care and to hold to WCC's value for patient-centered care, the leadership team solicited regular feedback from patients and staff as well. A regular monthly all-staff meeting has been instituted to create space for information exchange and feedback. Public Health Foundation/Sobering Center - $150,000 The purpose of this grant is to reduce unnecessary use of emergency room department services and to increase access to services and support for clients to participate in recovery and wellness from their substance abuse. Receipt of a final report on this grant is pending. Neighborhood Empowerment Network - $150,000 The grant project will end in June 2019 that will generate a final report on NEN's activities. 2018 Grants From the Garden to Table - $125,000 To promote recovery for SRO residents living in the Tenderloin community through healthy and safe cooking instruction. Public Health Foundation/Sobering Center - $189,000 To reduce unnecessary use of emergency room department services and to increase access to services and support for clients to participate in recovery and wellness from their substance abuse. Institute on Aging/Swindells Adult Social Day Center - $200,000 To support the Institute on Aging/Swindells Adult Social Day Center's relocation to a new site and necessary renovations required to provide services for vulnerable seniors. SisterWeb Doula Project - $465,650 over 24 months To build, grow and evaluate an innovative community-based doula program that will serve African American and Pacific Islander communities in San Francisco. Elder Care Alliance - $256,000 To support the Dementia-Inclusive Accelerator Project to reduce stigma and social distance for persons living with dementia and their care partners. 2018 Outcomes From the Garden to Table (G2T) successfully delivered 116 monthly and quarterly health education and cooking demonstrations, theatre and music events and physical exercise opportunities for residents of the Tenderloin's SRO's including the Cadillac Hotel and Salvation Army buildings. They reached a total of 1,736 residents, far exceeding their goal of 150. Participants reported improved range of motion, balance, emotional well-being and increased cooking skills using fresh organic ingredients. The organization was able to complete a sustainability plan based on the production and marketing of organic products. G2T enriched the Tenderloin community with celebratory events that brought residents together using healthy food, physical exercise and music to improve resident mental and physical health. They also participated in over 52 meetings to coordinate delivery of services with other Tenderloin service providers, SRO hotel managers and residents. Public Health Foundation/Sobering Center used their grant to continue to provide transport of intoxicated clients to the Sobering Center. During FY18/19, the Sobering Center received 850 total calls for transport, and completed 816 transports. There was a noted increase in number of clients transported and provided quality services to individuals regardless of their race or economic situation. Institute on Aging/Swindells Center for Adult Day Services was able to secure a lease with the Presidio Trust for a 7,034 square foot historic building in San Francisco. The acquisition of the new site allowed them to expand services from 53 clients to 96 clients and hire 16 additional staff due to a doubling of service space. The grant also funded the ADA required renovations to the building and supported their fundraising efforts. They have successfully raised $2.1 million to date. The new Swindells Enrichment Center will also house a 24-hour mobile response team and specialized homecare and caregiver training. Their goal is to reduce the number of Emergency Department visits by elderly clients who have no true medical reason for the visit. SisterWeb Doula Project has completed 12 months of their 24-month grant. The purpose of the grant is to create a new culturally-based model to reduce high infant mortality rates of African American and Pacific Islanders in San Francisco. In their first year of operation, they have established a number of successful partnerships. One is with Health Connect One (HCO) which is the only accrediting body for doulas. HCO is responsible for doula training. They have also conducted outreach to 100 hospitals and have partnerships with 4 out of 5 delivery hospitals. At the time of the report, 13 women reported healthy births with another 20 in the pipeline. They are working with UC Berkeley on an evaluation of quality of care. They are also working at the State legislative level to craft language for a bill on doula care and a service reimbursement process. Seventy percent of their project budget for the next 3 years has been raised. The project is already being recognized as a national model with requests for technical assistance to recreate it in other cities. Elder Care Alliance/Dementia Inclusive Communities Initiative successfully developed new tools for family members, caregivers, and aging professionals using arts and cultural events to foster greater connection and relationships with individuals with dementia. Materials developed were translated into Spanish, Chinese, Russian and Tagalog. The project also focused on strengthening cross-agency connection of senior service providers by hosting a series of workshops and meetings on promoting inclusive communities utilizing various forms of technology. The project forged partnerships with the College of Alameda, Alameda Healthcare and Wellness Center, SF Institute on Aging, Campus for Jewish Living, Contemporary Jewish Museum, St. James Episcopal Church, Visitation Valley Community Center and SOMArts. They reached families and senior serving agencies in the Excelsior, Richmond/Laurel Heights, Civic Center/Downtown, Visitation Valley and SOMA. In total, they engaged 525 people of color and collaborated with over 20 key stakeholders in the field of dementia services. For their innovative work, they received the Mather Lifeways Promising Practices Award. 2019 Grants Regional Pacific Islander Task Force - $20,000 To continue to raise awareness of the health needs of Pacific Islanders in San Francisco/ Bay Area and to align Bay Area Public Health Department efforts to better address social, economic and health disparities in Pacific Islander communities. 2019 Outcomes Regional Pacific Islander Task Force - due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the final report from the Task Force was extended for one year. 2020 Grants Mission Language and Vocational Services - $839,143 The purpose of this grant is to support a city-wide effort to conduct street outreach, conduct wellness calls and connect members of the Latinx community who have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic to services including access to financial assistance, food, personal protective equipment and supplies. COMMUNITY HEALTH INNOVATION FUND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FUND As a companion to the Community Health Innovation Fund, Sutter West Bay Hospital, a California nonprofit corporation doing business as California Pacific Medical Center (CPMC) entered into a Workforce Fund Grant Agreement with The San Francisco Foundation on October 9, 2013. As part of the development agreement, a Workforce Fund of $3,000,000 was created to provide grants to educational institutions and non-profit organizations in communities that are impacted by CPMC's hospital renovation and construction project. The goal of the fund is to engage in barrier reduction and job training for employment opportunities with CPMC, in accordance with the terms of the Workforce Fund Agreement. The affected communities include the Western Addition, Tenderloin, Mission/SOMA, Outer Mission/Excelsior, Chinatown and Southeastern neighborhoods in the City of San Francisco. To manage the Workforce Fund, a committee of fund advisors (Workforce Development Committee) was created and consists of a representative from the Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD) on behalf of the City, a representative from CPMC, and a representative from The San Francisco Foundation (TSFF). TSFF received its first payment of $2,000,000 towards the Workforce Fund on November 26, 2013, and a second payment of $1,000,000 on November 25, 2014, completing the $3,000,000 pledge. As part of the Development Agreement, TSFF took a combined seven percent management fee of $210,000. Since the last report in May 2018, the committee granted funds to five Barrier Reduction grantees, Jewish Vocation Services (JVS), Code Tenderloin/ Downtown Streets Team (DST), Self-Help for the Elderly (SHE), Success Centers SF (SCSF), and FACES SF. Throughout the 2018 grant year, the Workforce Development Committee continued to meet quarterly. On April 30, 2019, the original two grantees, JVS and SHE, completed their fourth year of funding, SCSF and FACES SF completed their third year of funding, and DST completed their first year of funding of a committed two-year agreement. FY 2015 & FY 2016 Grants In determining how best to allocate the grant making funds, to help reduce barriers to accessing jobs at CPMC, the Workforce Committee engaged a local consulting firm, KDG Enterprises to plan, coordinate and facilitate a series of eight focus group meetings. The focus group meetings provided the Workforce Committee with essential input on structural issues which present barriers for entry-level job seekers. This input was invaluable in our design of prospective grants to improve systems that provide training, workforce experience and skill building. The Foundation issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) in late 2014 that was developed based on the recommendations from the focus group meetings. The purpose of the RFP was to solicit proposals from experienced, educational and nonprofit organizations with a proven track record of providing integrated and coordinated, case-managed barrier removal, training and workforce preparedness services for non- construction, non-managerial and non-supervisory, entry-level employment at CPMC and/or other medical settings. Specifically, grantees were selected to provide Job Readiness Training, and/or On-the-Job Training services which were recommended during the focus group meetings. Of the 13 proposals submitted, four organizations were approved for funding totaling $540,000: 1. Jewish Vocational Services: To provide program support for job readiness training supported paid work experience, and placement assistance into living wage jobs to low-income San Franciscan residents at CPMC, and/or other health care facilities in San Francisco. ($150,000) 2. Mission Hiring Hall: To provide program support for job readiness training and placement services designed to overcome barriers to employment for low income, minority, and underserved San Francisco residents. ($150,000) 3. Positive Resource Center: To provide program support for job readiness training and placement in employment for disabled, low-income job seekers in San Francisco County. ($90,000) 4. Self-Help for the Elderly: To provide program support to ensure employment barrier reduction, job preparedness and placement for immigrant, Limited English Pro\u00decient, Asian Paci \u00dec Islander older adults and high needs youth in the City and County of San Francisco. ($150,000) Upon receiving the funds, the funded organizations worked with the Workforce Committee and the San Francisco workforce system to do outreach to potential program participants in the targeted communities. The organizations were required to meet quarterly as a cohort to share lessons learned and provide peer support to each other for the duration of their grants. The first quarterly meeting was conducted in April 2015 and was an opportunity for the grantees and Committee to meet and establish short, intermediate, and long-term goals. It was also an opportunity to establish and create a collaborative relationship. The cohort created the following goals: Goals Short-term goals: Conducting a site visit at CPMC and meeting with CPMC hiring managers to facilitate relationship building with CPMC; Collaborative marketing and communications materials in order to facilitate identification of clients who may be ready for immediate employment opportunities, and to also prevent duplicate efforts in marketing and communication materials. Intermediate goals: Assessment by CPMC with the grantees in order to address curriculum design and project implementation; Developing referral relationships; CPMC will develop a branding video about who they are, roots, history, value and value added of working for the organization. Long-term goals: Grant implementation, i.e., hiring and training San Francisco residents in the targeted neighborhoods as noted in the Development Agreement; Quarterly meetings which include sharing best practices among the group, sharing to reduce duplication of efforts and continued collaborative efforts and learnings among the cohort members; Rotation of meeting at offices of different grantees and partners to continue the collaborative working relationship and learning opportunities. FY 2015 & FY 2016 Outcomes Through the collaborative effort between the four grantees and the Committee over two fiscal years (July 1, 2014 - June 30, 2016), 519 San Francisco residents received either paid work experience, demonstrated gains in workplace competencies (i.e. computer/administrative training, academic skills and language skills), job readiness training or on-the-job training. 347 clients from the targeted neighborhoods have been placed in entry-level positions either at CPMC or other healthcare employers in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Of the 347 clients, 53 have been placed directly at CPMC medical facilities. FY 2017 Grants In FY17, the Committee renewed the original four grantees but noted two neighborhoods lacked direct grantee representation: The Southeastern and Western Addition neighborhoods. Responding to this, the Committee released a duplicate RFP focused on these two specific neighborhoods and approved two additional grants to the following organizations for a total of $250,000: 1. Success Center SF: To create a Healthcare Pathway for low-income residents in the Western Addition neighborhood of San Francisco, who face multiple barriers to employment to obtain and retain jobs in healthcare. ($125,000) 2. Young Community Developers: To deliver job readiness training and associated placement services for residents of the Southeast sector of San Francisco with CPMC, and/or other health care facilities in San Francisco. ($125,000) Additionally, in 2017 grants to the original four grantees were renewed for another year for a total of $500,000: 1. Jewish Vocational Services: To provide program support for job readiness training, supported paid work experience, and placement assistance into living wage jobs to low-income San Franciscan residents at CPMC, and/or other health care facilities in San Francisco. ($125,000) 2. Mission Hiring Hall: To provide program support for job readiness training and placement services designed to overcome barriers to employment for low income, minority, and underserved San Francisco residents. ($125,000) 3. Positive Resource Center: To provide program support for job readiness training and placement in employment for disabled, low-income job seekers in San Francisco County. ($125,000) 4. Self-Help for the Elderly: To provide program support to ensure employment barrier reduction, job preparedness and placement for immigrant, Limited English Pro\u00decient, Asian Paci \u00dec Islander older adults and high needs youth in the City and County of San Francisco. ($125,000) FY 2017 Goals The goals of the FY2017 grant portfolio were similar to the goals of the FY2016 grant portfolio, with variance within the short-term goals. Short-term goals: Familiarize grantees new to the cohort with the hiring process of CPMC and facilitate relationships between the CPMC Recruitment Services Team Member and the CPMC hiring managers. Align program curriculum and training with the required q uali\u00decations of open CPMC positions. Share marketing and communications materials to facilitate identi \u00decation of clients who may be ready for immediate employment opportunities or identify clients that require different types and levels of training, as well as to prevent duplicative efforts. Orient new staff members of the individual organization to existing practices of the cohort and the relationship between the cohort, CMPC, OEWD and TSFF. Intermediate goals: Continued alignment and assessment by CPMC with the grantees to address curriculum design and project implementation; Develop referral relationships; CPMC to develop a branding video about CPMC, i.e., who CPMC is, its roots, history, value and value added of working for the organization. Continued alignment between hiring projections for CPMC and required placements by grantees. Long-term goals: Grant implementation, i.e., hiring and training San Francisco residents in the targeted neighborhoods as required by the Development Agreement; Quarterly meetings which include sharing best practices among the group, sharing to reduce duplication of efforts and continued collaborative efforts and learnings among the cohort members; Rotation of meeting at offices of different grantees and partners to continue the collaborative working relationship and learning opportunities. Strengthen the workforce training and services infrastructure in the Tenderloin Neighborhood to increase healthcare job placements for Tenderloin residents. FY 2017 Outcomes CPMC and OEWD have played an integral role in the overall process. CPMC continues to work closely with each of the grantees from coordinating meetings with their hiring managers, to working directly with the grantees to discuss CPMC's hiring needs and strengthening the relationship between the grantees and hiring managers, as well as partnering with the Office of Economic and Workforce Development and The San Francisco Foundation to identify new grantees. Through collaborative efforts between the six grantees and the Committee over the FY17 grant period (May 1, 2016 - April 30, 2017), 476 San Francisco residents received either paid work experience, demonstrated gains in workplace competencies (i.e. computer/administrative training, academic skills, language skills, Medical Assistant training), barrier removal services, job readiness training or on-the-job training. 330 clients from the targeted neighborhoods have been placed in entry-level positions either at CPMC or other healthcare employers in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Grantees of the CPMC cohort exceed their overall placement goal of 192 by 172%. Of the 330 placements, 22 of those were placed at CPMC facilities. The Committee and the grantee cohort will continue to strategize to meet CPMC's overall job placement goals for target neighborhood residents. Due to poor performance metrics and placements at CPMC healthcare facilities, the Committee discontinued its funding for Positive Resource Center (PRC) and Mission Hiring Hall (MHH) at the end of the 2017 grant period. The target population of PRC was not the best fit for the per diem initial hiring period of the CPMC hiring process. PRC's clients are largely from the disabled population and have stated to PRC that they lose significant health care and other benefits when they accept per diem employment that has uncertain working hours and total compensation before being hired permanently. The wage uncertainty created issues around paying rent and other living expenses upon which their overall livelihood depends. MHH has suffered significant staff turnover during the two years they participated in the cohort, and this turnover has significantly affected its ability to meet the goals it set for its CPMC Workforce Development grants. FY 2019 Grants In 2019, the committee decided to (a) renew four of the six FY 2018 grantees, and (b) add one new organization. Young Community Developers that was funded in the fiscal year 2018 was removed from the cohort due to the committee's decision to fund the capacity building of a new organization focused on workforce development in the Tenderloin of San Francisco. The resulting five grantees were renewed for an interim period through June 30, 2019 for funding totaling $557,500: 1. Jewish Vocational Services: To provide program support for job readiness training, supported paid work experience, and placement assistance into living wage jobs to low-income San Franciscan residents at CPMC, and/or other health care facilities in San Francisco. ($85,000) 2. Self-Help for the Elderly: To provide program support to ensure employment barrier reduction, job preparedness and placement for immigrant, Limited English Pro\u00decient, Asian Paci \u00dec Islander, older adults and high needs youth in the City and County of San Francisco. ($85,000) 3. Success Center San Francisco: To create a Healthcare Pathway for low-income residents in the Western Addition neighborhood of San Francisco, who face multiple barriers to employment to obtain and retain jobs in healthcare. ($65,000) 4. FACES SF: To provide job readiness and placement assistance services for low- income residents of the Southeast Sector of San Francisco to attain clinical or non- clinical employment at CPMC and/or other health care facilities in San Francisco. ($65,000) The committee added Downtown Streets Team to the list of grantees with $75,000 in interim funding: 1. Downtown Streets Team: To provide job readiness and placement assistance services for low-income residents of the Southeast Sector of San Francisco to attain clinical or non-clinical employment at CPMC and/or other health care facilities in San Francisco. FY 2019 Outcomes In terms of the financial report, funds from the San Francisco Foundation were disbursed in FY 2018 beginning the grant period on July 1st. As of March 31, 2019, the cohort collectively provided some form of workforce training to 295 San Francisco residents. 102 residents from the targeted neighborhoods as well as other San Francisco neighborhoods were placed in entry-level jobs in the healthcare sector. Of the 102 placements, 14 of those were placed directly at CPMC facilities. The report above is representative of the grant's first three quarters (July 1, 2018 - March 31, 2019). Four Year Outcomes The Foundation, CPMC and OEWD collaboratively have played an integral role in the quarterly meetings and overall process, which are facilitated by consultants hired by the Foundation. CPMC worked with each of the grantees from hosting onsite visits to CPMC and coordinating meetings with their hiring managers, to working directly with the grantees to discuss CPMC's hiring needs and strengthening their relationship between the grantees and hiring managers. Through this collaborative effort between a total of seven grantees and the Committee over the last four years (FY 2015 - FY19), 1053 clients from the targeted neighborhoods and from other neighborhoods have been placed in entry-level positions either at CPMC or other healthcare employers in San Francisco and the Bay Area. Of the 1053 clients, 111 have been placed directly with CPMC. FY 2020 Grants In reaching the end of the 5-year Workforce Fund Grant Agreement between the San Francisco Foundation and CPMC, the committee decided on how best to allocate the remaining grantmaking funds of $962,107 to help reduce barriers to accessing jobs at CPMC. The Workforce Committee decided to distribute the remaining funds over three years to four of the five Barrier Reduction grantees, and to complete the last of the two-year agreement with the fifth organization (DST). Over this past year, grantees met with the committee as a larger group one last time in the summer of 2019 to discuss the distribution of the remaining funds as exit grants for these organizations. In April 2020, the following five grantees were renewed, four of which renewed for multi-year funding, and all totaling $962,106,51: 1.

CPMC has been working with OEWD and its netw ork of providers to build off 2019 and further refine the hiring processes and procedures that will enhance opportunitie s for targeted groups and accelerate the progress toward the 40% local hiring goal. The recruitment team at CPMC meets regularly with OEWD. We have devel oped a foundation and mutually shared vision for working together throughout the term of the Development Agreement. Below is a summary of how CPMC has de monstrated good faith efforts to date: Hiring CPMC made 64 entry level hires in 2020. To reach the 40% goal, 26 FS hires were needed. CPMC hired 32 FS candidates in 2020. 72% of FS hires came from ta rgeted neighborhoods in 2020. Thru the first four months of 2021 CPMC has a 29% FS hiring rate, 6 FS hires out of 21 total hires. Thru the first four months of 2021, 67% of FS hires came from targeted neighborhoods. CPMC is actively referring ever y San Francisco candidate to OEWD to improve their chance s for employment, whether at CPMC or elsewhere. Exhibit A charts the local hiring percentage for 2020. Exhibit B charts the percentage of those hires from targeted neighborhoods in 2020. Exhibit C charts the local hiring percentage for the first four months in 2021. Exhibit D charts the percentage of those hires from targeted neighborhoods in the first four months of 2021. Active Engagement and Resource Allocation Weekly meetings with hiring mana gers with constant reminders on the importance of the workforce agreement. Engaged in approx. 45 job fairs, employer spotlights, meetings/workshops in 2020. At the time of this submittal CPMC has participated in an additional 7 engagements in 2021, see Exhibit E. In addition to one full time recr uiter designated to entry level hiring, CPMC applied additional resources to effectively evaluate and process referrals. Hiring Projections Detailed Hiring Projections for Aug. 2020 thru July 2021 were provided to OEWD, s ee Exhibit F. Detailed Hiring Projections for Aug. 2021 thru July 2022 will be provided to OEWD in August 2021. Priorities for 2020 In addition to meeting the minimum good faith efforts of providing OEWD with hiring projections, notifying OEWD of all entry level po sitions, giving OEWD an exclusive 10 days to refer candidates for entry level positions, c onsidering candidates referred by the workforce system, working to meet the hiring goal of 40%, and continuing to fine-tune the systems put in place thus far, CPMC has also committed to the following: Participating in regular weekly check-ins with OEWD and its sector leads. Attending various community job fairs/even ts sponsored by OEWD and various CBOs targeting the priority areas noted in the Development Agreement. Applying approximately 50 hours per week in time and resources to monitor, track, capture, report, and effectively eval uate and process referrals. Prioritizing system referrals past the minimum 10 days if a requisition has not been filled. Expediting the application of the Workforce Training funds. Worked with CBO leads to identify qualified candidates. Challenges The COVID pandemic has created negative im pacts on both clini cal and non-clinical hiring at CPMC. Strain on our CPMC workforce due to the li mited pipeline of qualified San Francisco candidates. Escalating cost of living and lack of a ffordable housing within San Francisco.

CPMC employees who park at offsite facilities pay subsidized rates that vary by facility. 2020 Employee/Physician Commute Survey Summary of Key Results A major component of the TDM Plan and a requirement of the DA is the annual employee/physician commute survey. The survey provides baselines for Sutter Health CPMC (CPMC) relative to reporting data to the SFMTA. CPMC's overall 2020 employee population in San Francisco was approximately 5,000 staff. The survey was administered to eligible staff through our intranet HealthStream platform with 4,413 staff completing the survey, for a response rate of 88%. Thus, exceeding the minimum 30% response rate requirement established by SFMTA for statistical validity of the survey. Given the unprecedented impacts caused by the pandemic, there were significant shifts in the ways staff traveled to work. Based on the 2020 survey results, CPMC's singleoccupant vehicle mode share went up 8 percent points as compared to the 2019 mode split. Use of public transit went down 10 percent point, and use of ridehailing services (taxi, Uber or Lyft) remained constant. A new category of working entirely from home accounted for approximately 5 percent of staff: SOV (drive alone) 62% Public motorcycles at 1%) Work from home 5% When asked if given a choice, whether staff would like to maintain their 2020 commute pattern, after the pandemic was over: Very Likely 68% Somewhat Likely 12% Somewhat unlikely 4% Not Likely at all 5% Don't Know 12% Since the opening of the Van Ness Hospital, more than 53 percent of staff work at the Van Ness Campus.

The new Van Ness Campus was developed as part of the approved Development Agreement; the Van Ness hospital opened in March 2019 . Through i ts oper ations of these medical fac ilitie s, CPMC provides a broad range of inpatient and outpatient health services, as well as direct and indire ct econ omic benefi is owned by Sutter Health and is one of San Francisco's largest non-p ublic employer s, with over 6,000 emplo yees. Sutter Health undertook reno vation or reconstruction of its acute -care hospitals to comply with State law (SB 1953) , which requires th at all acute-care hospitals be seismica lly up graded so that they are operati onal after a major earth quake. Three of C PMC's four acute- care hospitals - the California, Pacifi c, and St. Luke's campuses - did not meet seismic standards and needed to be rebuilt or de- licensed in order to comply wi th this law. The Davies Campus w as retrofi tted in 2008, enabli ng thi s campus modate acute- care hospit al services until 2030 ; no construction is presently planned at that campus . To meet state l aw, CPMC consolidated a cute-care se rvices from the P acific and Cali fornia campuses i nto the new Van Ness Campus (formerly called the Cathedral Hill Camp us). The Van Ness Hospital opened in March 2019 and the associated Medical Office Building was completed in 2019. The p roject al so provided a ne w, seismically safe ho spital, which opened in August 2018 , to replace the old St. Luke's Hospital at the Mission Bernal Campus in the Miss ion District . Related construction, including renovation and reconfiguration of the Mission Bernal Campus, is ongoing. These constru ction proje cts have created approximately 1,500 constru ction jo bs and involve the expendi ture of over $2 bill ion in total developme nt costs. They have i ncreased the number of ear thquake- safe ho spital beds in San Francisco a nd are intended to improve heal thcare access for all San Fr anciscans. The CPMC proje ct also provides Comm unity Benefits in ad ditio n to the commit ment to rebuild St. Luke' s Hospital, incl uding a com munity heal th care p rogram, a tr ansp ortation and transit p rogram, a w orkforce develop ment program, a public improveme nt program, a nd payments to provide for specific service s, program s, and infrastru cture. To guarantee these Co mmunity Benefit s, CPMC and the City e ntered into a Develop ment Agreeme nt (DA ), whi ch wa s approved by the Board of Supe rvisors in July 2013 and became effective on A ugust 10, 2013.1 Annual Revi ew Proc ess. The DA re quires an an nual review to ensure that bo th the City and CPMC are i n compli ance wi th their respective ob ligatio ns and that Co mmunity Ben efits are 1 The DA is available on the Planning Department's website at http://default.sfplanning.org/publications_reports/cpmc/cpmc_DevAgrmtFinal_exhibits.pdf . CPMC 2020 City Report - page 1 being deli vered.2 As described in Section 8.2 of the DA, C PMC is required to submit an Annual Compliance Statement to the City no later than 150 days after the end of its fiscal year (currently, the calendar year). The City is then required to post CPMC's statement and receive public comment for 30 days. At the conclusion of the public comment period, the City has 45 days to publish a report on whether CPMC is in compliance with the Development Agreement. Both the Health and Planning Commissions will then hold public hearings on CPMC's compliance with a 60-day notice to the public. After these hearings, the Planning and Health Directors will forward their findings on to an independent third -party monitor. The monitor will have 30 days to review the findings and evidence of CPMC's compliance with the DA before sending a letter to the Board of Supervisors stating whether he or she concurs with the Directors' findings. The annual review s for 2019 and 2020 were affected by the public health emergency caused by the coronavirus pandemic. All of the reporting and review milestones outlined in the DA were delayed, and further delays may occur during the upcoming steps in the review process.

CPMC 2020 City Report - page 2 City Report. This document is the City's eighth Annual Report on CPMC's compliance ; it contains findings of compliance on each of CPMC 's and the City's obligations under the DA. Major obligations, including Sutter's performance of its healthcare and hiring commitments, are summarized below. Healthcare Commitments Reconstruction of St. Luke's Hospital. The DA required CPMC to construct a new hospital to replace St. Luke's and to open the new hospital within 24 months after the opening of the Van Ness Campus hospital. With the completion of the new Mission Bernal Hospital, which opened on August 24, 2018 , earlier than required , this obligation has been met. Baseline Commitment: Medi -Cal and Charity Care. Under the DA, CPMC is required to serve at least 30,445 unduplicated Medi -Cal or Charity Care patients in San Francisco each year. CPMC served 28,900 undup licated patients during 2020, however, the DA stipulates that CPMC may use a 2 -year rolling average and apply the excess from the prior or succeeding year to meet this commitment. CPMC served a total of 35,456 unduplicated patients in 2019; therefore, CPMC's 2 -year rolling average for 2020 was 32,178 unduplicated patients. Baseline Commitment: Expenditures. CPMC is required to spend at least $8 million for community benefits each year. CPMC exceeded this commitment in 2020, providing $ 15.2 million in community benefits including support for the Bayview Child Health Center. Medi -Cal Beneficiaries. Beginning with the August 2013 Effective Date of the DA, CPMC must provide hospital services for an additional 5,400 Medi -Cal beneficiaries each year. CPMC has consistently exceeded this goal and, as of the end of 2020, covered 38,187 Medi -Cal managed care beneficiaries. Mission Bernal Campus . With the opening of the Mission Bernal Campus Hospital in 2018, CPMC is required to operate the Mission Bernal Hospital as a general acute care hospital with comprehensive emergency services and provide certain inpatient, outpatient, and urgent care services. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, CPMC temporarily moved labor and delivery services to the Van Ness Campus to utilize the space for COVID surge planning. CPMC does not have a specific timeline to restore inpatient labor and delivery services at the Miss ion Bernal Campus. In addition, the DA requires CPMC to submit a proposal and begin construction for the development of the Mission Bernal Campus Medical Office Building within 5 years after the opening of the Mission Bernal Hospital. In June 2020, CPMC submitted permit applications to the San Francisco Departments of Planning and Building Inspection and is in process of developing a proposal for approval by the Sutter West Bay Board. Innovation Fund. CPMC's DA funding obligations included total payments of $8.6 million to the San Francisco Foundation to support community clinics and community -based healthcare. CPMC made the final payment in November 2017, and its obligation is complete. The San Francisco Foundation continued to use the fund make grants to local health institutions and community organizations, consistent with its requirements under the DA. CPMC 2020 City Report - page 3 Centers of Excellence in Community Health and Senior Health. CPMC is required to create Centers o f Excellence at the St. Luke's Campus to assist patients with or at risk of chronic illnesses and to provide improved inpatient and post- hospitalization care to seniors. This obligation commenced with the opening of the new Mission Bernal hospital , and in 2018 Sutter established both required Centers of Excellence: The Center of Excelle nce in Community Health ( HealthFirst ) is a center for health education and disease prevention affiliated with St. Luke's Health Care Center. HealthFirst serves patients in chronic disease management by integrating community health workers into a mult idisciplinary health care team to provide heal th education, assist patients to improve their self -management skills, and encourage them to receive timely and comprehensive care. HealthFirst saw 830 unique patients in 2020 and carried out 2,780 encounters. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the community ad visory board did not meet in 2020 and was replaced by a series of phone interviews with providers and patients. The Center of Excellence in Senior Health is made up of the Acute Care for the Elderly (ACE) Unit, the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) , and a pilot partnership with the non- profit organization San Francisco Village. The ACE Unit at Mission Bernal Campus has 34 beds providing interdisciplinary care to older adult patients ; this unit saw 1,256 patients in 2020, exceeding the DA goal of 600 patients . In addition, Sutter continues to operate a community benefit- funded pilot partnership with S an F rancisco Village to provide eligible discharged patients with a care navigator to help patients manage their health, prepare for doctor's visi ts, and gain access to needed community services to ease the transition from hospital to home. Hiring Commitments The DA requires CPMC to participate in a workforce development program that includes local hiring goals for construction and certain operational activities, as well as a L ocal Business Enterprise contracting program. 3 Four major projects - the new Mission Bernal Hospital, Van Ness Hospital, and the Van Ness Garage and Medical Office Building , and Medical Office Building tenant improvements - were completed before or during 2019, and Herrero Boldt, Sutter's prime contractor for these projects, provided fina l cumulative construction hiring figures as part of the 2019 compliance report. No construction covered by the workforce agreement occurred during 2020. Construction Hiring. The local construction hiring goals established by the DA include: 50 percent of total non -union entry -level administrative and engineering positions. The final cumulative total was reported by Herrero Boldt as 83 percent. 3 Hiring goals are reported on a fiscal year (July 1 -June 30) basis and thus the updated 2018- 2019 figures in this City Report do not match the figures provided in the CPMC Annual Compliance Report. CPMC 2020 City Report - page 4 50 percent of total entry -level administrative and engineering internship positions. Herrero Boldt reported that the final cumulative total was 61 percent. 50 percent of total union entry -level apprentice positions. Herrero Boldt also reported that the fin al cumulative total was 30 percent. However, CPMC has met its good -faith obligation under the DA. 30 percent of total work hours by union journeymen and apprentices. Herrero Boldt reported that the final work hour total was 5,620,416 work hours, of which 1 ,325,455 work hours (24 percent) were performed by San Francisco residents. CPMC has met its good -faith obligation under the DA. CPMC is generally in compliance with construction hiring goals. The DA requires good -faith efforts to meet these goals; CPMC's and its contractors' efforts to increase local hiring were described in greater detail previous annual reporting . Ongoing and fut ure projects, including eventual construction of the new Mission Bernal Medical Office Building, will be subject to the same goals. Operational Hiring. CPMC's First Source hiring goal for entry -level operational (non - construction -related Sutter employees) is 40 percent. For the hiring year from January through December 2020 , 50 percent ( 32 of 64 ) entry- level hires were made through the City's First Source referral program . Local Business Enterprise Contracting. Under this program, CPMC has made payments totaling 16 percent of construction expenditures to date to qualified contractors, exceeding the DA goal of 14 percent. Payments and Funding Commitments CPMC was required to make cash payments totaling over $70 million, in cluding endowment of a health care innovation fund and payments for affordable housing, workforce training, transportation improvements (in lieu of other transportation impact fees), and public improvements, including streetscape and pedestrian safety impr ovements near the Van Ness Campus. The final payments were made on November 8, 2017, and CPMC has fulfilled this obligation. Other Commitments Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Measures. The DA includes a TDM plan, which commits CPMC to reducing the proportion of employees who drive to work alone and to increasing use of public transportation, carpooling, walking, cycling, and other transportation alternatives. CPMC has initiated the prog rams required to date, including a transit pass subsidy that began in January 2017. Approximately 15 percent of employees receive the transit subsidy as of the date of this report, and about 14 percent of employees use d transit to get work. Sutter reported that the ongoing pandemic considerably altered commute patterns; the share of employees and physicians commuting in single -occupancy vehicles was 62 percent, an increase CPMC 2020 City Report - page 5 of 8 percent, during the 2020 reporting period . Transit use declined b y 10 percent, and approximately 5 percent of employees worked entirely from home. While CPMC has generally met this obligation to date, a further reduction in single -occupant vehicle trips by both employees and visitors is needed to meet the DA goal of red uction of such trips as a share of the total (compared to 2013) by 15 percent by 2024. Mission Bernal Campus Area Improvements. The DA requires CPMC to build a number of street and pedestrian improvements around the Mission Bernal Campus, including traffi c signals, street lighting, and permanent upgrades to the temporary plaza at the intersection of Guerrero Street and San Jose Avenue, south of the campus, to create a new Guerrero Park. The first set of these improvements is required to be completed at the time the plaza adjacent to the new hospital is complete, which is projected to be no sooner than 2022 . CPMC has initiated detailed design of these improvements and c oordination with City agencies and has applied for the necessary permits for the park . CPMC is coordinating closely with City agencies to finalize a complete set of streetscape designs that are integrated with the surrounding neighborhood context. Rate Increase Limitations. Sutter Health is a provider under the City's Health S ervice System (HSS). In this role, it must limit annualized fee for service rate increases to no more than the Medical Rate of Inflation plus 1.5 percent (the \"Annual Rate Increase\") for each year through 2023. These increases are verified by an independent auditor. The City received the auditor's report for the 2018 -to-2019 rate increases shortly before publication of this City Report and is reviewing it. Updated information on rate increases and compliance with this DA requirement will be presented at the public hearing of the Planning and Health Commissions to be held in December 2021. Areas of Concern 2020 Baseline Medi -Cal/Charity Care Patient Commitment. CPMC served a total of 28,900 unduplicated patients between 1/1/2020 and 12/31/2020. This number falls 1,555 short of the 2020 obligation. However, the two -year rolling average provision in the DA allows CPMC to apply an excess from the prior or succee ding fiscal year to meet this baseline commitment. CPMC is compliant with this provision based on the two -year rolling average for fiscal years 2019 and 2020. CPMC reported that the decrease in unduplicated patients served was due to the COVID -19 pandemi c. This trend was seen in other health care systems in San Francisco as some patients delayed or avoided medical care due to concerns about COVID -19 and health care facilities deferred elective visits and certain outpatient care for medical surge planning . Labor and Delivery Services at the Mission Bernal Campus. The DA requires CPMC to provide certain inpatient, urgent care, and outpatient services at the Mission Bernal Campus. In 2020, CPMC moved labor and delivery services at the Mission Bernal Campus to the Van Ness Campus to use the space as a potential COVID -19 surge unit. As of September 2021, CPMC does not have a specific timeline to restore inpatient labor and delivery services at the Mission Bernal Campus. CPMC 2020 City Report - page 6 Sub- Acute Care Services. The DA requi red CPMC to make good -faith efforts to address the continuing decline in the availability of sub -acute care beds in San Francisco, but provision of sub- acute beds is not required under the DA and thus is not evaluated in the annual reporting process. Howev er, the Board of Supervisors, Health and Planning Commissions, and the public have expressed concerns about the loss of sub -acute care beds at Sutter's CPMC facilities at previous public hearings. Sutter closed all sub -acute care beds at St. Luke's in 2018 and transferred the remaining SNF patients formerly at St. Luke's to its Davies Campus. No new sub- acute patients have been accepted since that time and no sub -acute beds were included in the Mission Bernal hospital or the Van Ness Geary hospital. In 201 9, DPH convened meetings with private and public stakeholders to assess and develop strategies to address sub -acute services citywide. CPMC participated in these meetings and has been open to discussions on potential strategies to increase sub -acute care in the City but has not yet committed to supporting a specific strategy. Sub -acute care planning was delayed in 2020 due to the COVID -19 pandemic and no additional sub -acute beds were added in 2020. The City will resume this work in 2021. Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS). The DA requires CPMC to deliver culturally and linguistically appropriate services that are representative of San Francisco's diverse communities at all its campuses. In previous years, the City's annual review resulted in recommendations for substantial improvements in such services, particularly at the St. Luke's Diabetes Clinic, where the patient population has historically included many monolingual Spanish- speaking patients. In the 2018 joint hearing, the He alth Commission encouraged CPMC to provide supplemental information (i.e. , campus- specific data on patient and staff demographics, languages, payor mix, zip code, and charity care) for the Mission and Van Ness Geary Hospitals to help the City have a deeper understanding of CPMC's compliance with CLAS standards and demonstrate that the new hospitals are truly serving the communities in which they are located. CPMC reported supplemental information on patient race/ethnicity, preferred language, staff demographics, and interpreter requests/wait time. Additional details are included in the healthcare tables that follow this introductory section. 1,500 Medi -Cal Managed Care Enrollees in the Tenderloin . The DA requires CPMC to participate in a Medi -Cal managed care partnership with a Tenderloin -based primary care provider to serve up to 1,500 Medi -Cal beneficiaries. I n June 2020, the North East Medical Services (NEMS) MSO opened a primary care clinic at 650 Polk Street, and there is now one available MSO with a primary care provider based in the Tenderloin. CPMC reports that it was the hospital partner for 4, 351 unduplicated lives in the Tenderloin through the NEMS MSO during 2020. Prior to June 2020, there was no available MSO with a primary care provider based in the Tenderloin and despite efforts by CPMC to support the creation of one, it was deemed CPMC 2020 City Report - page 7 financially unfeasible by clinic partners. In 2015, CPMC initiated a partnership with the North East Medical Services (NEMS) Management Services Organization (MSO) and St. Anthony's Medical Clinic, a primary care clinic in the Tenderloin, to have St. Anthony's join the NEMS MSO, as a pathway for CPMC to meet this commitment. Enrollment specifically through the St. Anthony's partnership has remained stagnant over the last several reporting periods, with a peak enrollment of 189 beneficiaries reported in September 2017. As of December 2020, the membership count was 17 3. In previous hearings, CPMC reported that barriers to increasing enrollment were primarily due to potential enrollees opting to receive care at other hospitals, challenges reaching individuals to complete enrollment due to outdated or incorrect contact information, and staffing shortages at St. Anthony's Clinic, which impact its abilit y to conduct outreach and promote the partnership. Other ongoing areas of concern include community engagement in the development of CPMC's Centers for Excellence for Community Health and Senior Health. More information on these issues and progress since the 2019 compliance review is included in the detailed tables that follow this introductory section. Guerrero Park Completion . As noted above, certain aspects of the Guerrero Park design and other streetscape improvements remain to be resolved. The City and CPMC are coordinating closely to finalize design decisions, including the details of the permanent closure of San Jose Avenue and the southern bulbout and crosswalk. Although this DA commitment is not due until 202 2 at the earliest, the lack of resolution of these issues, together with the time needed for park construction once a permit is issued, indicate that the timeline in the DA may not be reached. Once the design of the streetscape improvements is finalized, the City and CPMC could mutuall y agree to a limited extension to the timeline specified in the DA for this community benefit project to allow an appropriate construction period. The tables on page s 11 to 56 of this report describe each obligation that is due under the DA as follows: Lead D epartme nt: The City department responsible for implementing o r overseeing the obligatio n.

CPMC provided the Department with updates on their construction schedule, including with its Annual Compliance Reports. During hospital construction, CPMC regularly updated the construction schedule for both Mission Bernal (formerly St. Luke's) and Van Ness (formerly Cathedral Hill) on the CPMC2020 website (http://cpmc2020.org/). CPMC has also been in frequent communication with the Planning Department about future construction planning at both campuses. CPMC should continue to keep the Department abreast of any changes to the existing construction schedules as well as significant phases of construction. CPMC maintained the CPMC2020 website (http://cpmc2020.org/) with construction bulletins and project updates and schedules during construction. With the completion of the new hospitals, this website is no longer being updated. However, CPMC should continue the practice of notifying neighbors in advance of significant construction activities such as the proposed Medical Office Building at the Mission Bernal Campus and could reactivate the CPMC2020 website when major construction begins again at Mission Bernal or another campus.

Committee meetings occurred on a bi annual basis: October 8, 2020 and May 6, 2021 to do a thorough review of performance outcomes, discuss challenges and successes with workforce programming, and strategize on how best to connect SF residents to employment at CPMC. The total amount of funding allocated to the 4 nonprofit workforce partners (Jewish Vocational Services, SelfHelp for the Elderly, Success Center, and FACES SF) for the remaining two program years of the grant term (PY2122 & PY2223) is a cumulative of $870,000. During PY2021 our nonprofit workforce partners continued to provide employment barrier reduction, job preparedness, and placement services to lowincome residents in San Francisco. In May, 2021, the Workforce Committee had preliminary discussions about yearend performance and discussed funding allocations. Contracts for PY2021 focused on job readiness training, placement assistance, paid work experience and/or barrier reduction to properly prepare residents for both clinical and nonclinical employment opportunities with competitive wages in the healthcare industry. Contracts for PY2021 thru PY2223 effectively started on April 2, 2020, and scopes of work include language re: CPMC outreach and employment services to City residents for the 4 SF Foundation workforce programming partners. The Workforce Committee will continue to support grantees to ensure that training and employment services are meeting the workforce needs of San Franciscans. Grantees will continue to provide services such as employment barrier reduction, job preparedness, and placement services to support low income residents in San Francisco. CPMC, in coordination with OEWD's Business Services Team will continue to schedule virtual and inperson based Employer Spotlights and Hiring Events citywide.

Brief History: The San Francisco Foundation received $2,000,000 of the Workforce Fund in December 2013 and spent the rest of 2014 planning, writing and issuing an RFP for funding. In March, 2015, four grantees received grant awards from the San Francisco Foundation: Jewish Vocational Service, Mission Hiring Hall, Positive Resource Center, and Self Help for the Elderly; with grant awards beginning in April 2015. On August 17, 2015 The San Francisco Foundation released a duplicate RFP with a focus on Bayview and Western Addition communities, in which the Success Center and Young Community Developers were awarded funding to provide training and workforce services to prepare residents from their respective communities for employment at CPMC. During PY 1617 it was decided that Mission Hiring Hall and Positive Resource Center would not continue as part of the portfolio due to continuous struggles with performance measures, and FACES SF would be awarded funding due to their high placement rates and successful collaborative efforts with CPMC. During this time the contract cycles were adjusted to mirror OEWD's fiscal year (July 1June 30) in an effort to provide better program and outcome alignment. Beginning in PY1718 contract outcomes focused on qualitative services to properly prepare residents for both clinical and nonclinical employment opportunities.

CPMC reports that it is the hospital partner for 4,351 unduplicated lives in the Tenderloin through the NEMS MSO. Prior to the opening of the NEMS 650 Polk Street clinic, CPMC contracted with the NEMS MSO in 2015 and worked with NEMS and St. Anthony's Clinic, a primary care provider in the Tenderloin, to have St. Anthony's join the NEMS MSO. Through this partnership, CPMC is the hospital partner for St. Anthony's participating medical groups. As of Dec 31, 2020, St. Anthony's has 172 members that enrolled in the NEMS/CPMC partnership.

The failure to complete the San Jose Avenue City Project in accordance with the timing set forth in the Schedule and Phasing Plan may entitle CPMC to a period of Excusable Delay in connection with the Hospital Commitment as set forth in Section 10.6.2. Projects 1201J Cesar Chavez Street Sewer Improvement Project and 1068J Cesar Chavez Streetscape Improvements - 101 To Guerrero are complete. The pedestrian enhancements include three dozen bulb-outs that widen the sidewalk at intersections to shorten the crossing distance; widened medians where people can wait safely to cross the street if they can't make it in one traffic-signal cycle; and raised crosswalks at two intersections to increase driver awareness. Other upgrades include new bike lanes, left-turn pockets for motorists, new and rehabilitated sewers and new paving along the entire stretch to make the ride safer and smoother for all users. Traffic lanes were reduced from three in each direction to two. In addition, several environmentally smart design elements were incorporated. Among them: storm-water planters and pervious pavement to allow rainwater to percolate through the ground to put less burden on the sewer system; and 302 new street trees and 7,600 plants along the median and the sidewalks. In all, 38,620 sq. ft. of concrete and asphalt were converted to green space. Streetlights along the corridor also were upgraded to LED for energy efficiency.

CPMC 2020 City Report - page 1181 June 30, 2020 By electronic submission to elizabeth.purl@sfgov.org Elizabeth Purl, Development Performance Coordinator San Francisco Planning Department 1650 Mission Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94103 Re: Comments of San Franciscans for Healthcare, Housing, Jobs & Justice (SFHHJJ) on CPMC's 2019 Compliance Statement Dear Ms. Purl: SFHHJJ is a community -labor coalition that has worked to ensure that Sutter Health/CPMC's reconfiguration of it s San Francisco campuses serves the interests of patients, workers, neighboring communities, and the City as a whole. Although not a party to the Development Agreement (DA) signed by the City and CPMC, SFHHJJ played a key role in shaping its outline and g arnering support on the Board of Supervisors for the community benefits package incorporated in it. SFHHJJ has closely monitored the City's and CPMC's implementation of the DA and has submitted written comments and public testimony throughout the complian ce review process in all of the past six annual review cycles. Over the past six cycles, SFHHJJ has urged the City to conduct this annual compliance review process as more than a formalistic, yes/no box -checking exercise. The process can and should be used to develop the information necessary to enable a public dialogue on progress and remaining impediments to meeting the full promise and spirit of the DA , particularly CPMC's pivotal role in addressing San Francisco healthcare needs. The devastating effe cts of the Covid -19 pandemic, which have been borne disproportionately by lower income and minority communities, underscore even more the need for a holistic assessment of CPMC's performance . Although it is too late to remedy the past, i t is still timely to seek to affect CPMC's conduct now and in the near future. Tracking Unduplicated Medi -Cal and Charity Care Patients Continues to be a n Insufficient and Weak Measure for Determining CPMC's Performance in Meeting the Needs of Lower Income San Franciscans . MARK N. AARONSON Professor of Law, Emeritus Community Justice Clinics UC Hastings College of the Law 200 McAllister Street San Francisco, CA 94102 aaronson @uchastings.edu (510) 504-4608 (cell) 2 SFHHJJ's comments on CPMC's 2018 Compliance Statement emphasized a number of structural defects in the DA review process. The most troubling is the inadequacy of relying exclusively on unduplicated Medi -Cal and charity care patients as a measure for the extent to which CPMC serves Medi -Cal beneficiaries, specifically, and lower -income San Franciscans overall. Each year SFHHJJ has pointed out that the Deloitte accounting firm's use of a randomized 25 -case sample is entirely too small to be reliable or v alid to confirm statistically the figures provided by CPMC . For 2019, CPMC claims to have served 35,456 unduplicated patients, which is almost 3,600 fewer patients than in 2018. The 2019 claimed number has yet to be reviewed by Deloitte because of a perf ormance extension granted in light of San Francisco's Shelter at Home order. While Deloitte's confirmation test is grossly flawed, t he main problem is that focusing only on unduplicated patients ignores the types and costs of services provided , which are better measures for determining the extensiveness of CPMC's services . Counting patients includes those who receive very brief attention, such as a routine lab test, as well as those hospitalized or receiving long-term treatment. It is the level of care r eceived by patients that best indicates the commitment s of hospital s to serving poorer individuals and families. The most alarming data regarding a decline in CPMC meeting the needs of lower income San Franciscans comes from fi ndings in the 2017 S.F. Hosp itals Charity Care Report , still the latest edition of the report publicly available . This rep ort reveals that among all S.F hospitals CPMC alone reported decreases in both traditional charity care costs and Medi -Cal shortfall amounts when comparing 2013, the year the DA was signed, and 2017, several years into the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) . For all other hospitals, the relationships were inverse: Charity care costs went down because more individuals became eligible under the ACA fo r expanded Medi -Cal coverage, and as a result Medi -Cal shortfall amounts went up, two to three times for some hospitals .1 Along with a two-third decrease in charity care costs in 2017 compared to 2013 , CPMC reported for its Pacific, California and Davies campuses a combined Medi -Cal shortfall of $63.5 million in 2013 and $62.8 million in 2017 and for its St. Luke's campus a drop almost in half from $26.0 million in 2013 to $13.4 million in 2017 .2 The anomalous, dual, downward trends in CPMC's charity care and Medi -Cal shortfall amounts are highly suggestive that CPMC has been on a course of providing less overall services to lower income San Franciscans than it did in 2013. CPMC's technical compliance with a narrowly drawn DA standard should not be a shie ld from further inquiry into whether it is, in fact, living up to its DA promises to do more not less in meeting the healthcare needs of Medi -Cal and other lower income San Franciscans. The San Francisco Foundation Report Is a Model for What the City Sh ould Receive from CPMC in Reporting Its Service Performance Obligations under the Development Agreement . In Exhibit E to Attachment 1 of the CPMC Compliance Statement, the San Francisco Foundation in a 22 -page report specifically describes the allocatio ns and outcomes of the grants made from the $8.6 million Community Health Innovation Fund and the $3.0 million Workforce 1 May 2019 draft of San Francisco Hospitals Charity Care Report 2017 , Figure s 18-20, at p p. 22-24. 2 Id. 3 Development Fund. Under the DA, the San Francisco Foundation is responsible for the administration of the funds. Its report comprehen sively lists first the grants made each year and then brief but incisive assessment s of the services provided by individual grant recipients in compliance with the terms of their respective awards. The report candidly includes information about a few organizational recipients whose performances were not satisfactory and were not funded for a subsequent year. In 2019, the Foundation made final distributions from the Workforce Development Fund. The remaining balance in the Community Health Innovation Fund is $840,000. The funds have been successfully u tilized by nonprofit organizations to meet healthcare and job development needs of lower income San Franciscans. By contrast, when addressing in the Compliance Statement its own performance of services, CPM C provides in s everal instances no factual or detailed information , some response s that are totally lacking in candor , and in others partial and incomplete accounts. With respect to service obligations under the DA , CPMC continually avoids analy zing the effectiveness of the described activities and actions in meeting patient needs and public interest concerns. CPMC's Compliance S tatement s regarding Its Charity Care and CLA S Programs either Are Devoid of Factual Information o r Lack Specific Fact ual Support . CPMC uses a two -page table to summarize its compliance with healthcare provisions of the DA. In a listing regarding transition to the ACA, a commitment column states: \"Ensure Charity Care policies comply with California law and do not deny Charity Care patients access to inpatient services.\" The compliance statement column states: \"CPMC maintained Charity Care policies that comply with California and ensured access to Charity Care patients to inpatient services.\" The supporting documenta tion column cites only \"2019 Charity Care Policy, \" which is as described nothing but its written policy with application and other forms. The policy became effective on January 1, 2016, and was due to be revised in 2019, though there is no indication it has been revised. CPMC provides no factual information nor data regarding its implementation of the policy and its usage by patients . It simply asserts that access has been ensured. CPMC adopts a formalistic approach in its compliance statement regardin g the availability of Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS). The DA provision to provide such services is mandatory. CPMC's supporting documentation is a 2018 CLAS Report, which matches national CLAS Standards with three column s of se lf-describ ed goals, processes, reviews , surveys, and materials . The listings are long, but they lack references to specific and accessible documentation addressing the effectiveness of the methods undertaken . To facilitate a realistic assessment of its e fforts, CPMC in separate supplemental filings should have provided relev ant patient and services data as well as illustrative examples . With the August 2018 opening of the Mission Bernal Campus and the March 2019 opening of the Van Ness Campus, CPMC cannot be allowed to skirt its responsibilities under the DA to provide a thorough and comprehensive assessment of the actual cultural and linguistic appropriateness of its new hospital campuses for all San Franciscans. For example, h ow much has CPMC spent on staffing of CLAS activities and for what kind s of positions in which units , 4 and w hat do surveys say about the comfort level of patients from diverse backgrounds who receive services at CPMC campuses? A compilation of various approaches for meeting CLAS standards put together before the openings of CPMC's new campuses is not responsive to the experiences of most CPMC patients during 2019. Moreover, the most important determinations concern CPMC's effectiveness or ineffectiveness in meeting the purposes of the CLAS standards , for which empirical evidence is necessary and which is not to be found in CPMC's 2019 Compliance Statement . Previously, SFHHJJ ha d raised in its comments on CPMC's compliance statements issues concerning the availability and accessibi lity of bilingual services in the diabetes clinic at St. Luke's Hospital, none of which ever satisfactorily acknowledged or resolved. In 2015, CPMC conducted a partial CLAS Assessment that it submitted to the Department of Public Health. A rigorous factu al assessment focused on the patient and services impact s of CPMC's CLAS approaches needs to be part of each year's DA compliance statement . In Its Compliance Statement, CPMC Sidesteps Its Responsibilities for Meeting the Healthcare Needs of Tenderloin Re sidents and Addressing the Crisis in the Availability of Sub-Acute Care in San Francisco . A major objective of the Development Agreement is to increase the availability and accessibility of CPMC's hospital and other healthcare services for Tenderloin resi dents. The requirement is to provide such services to at least 1,500 new Medi -Cal enrollees residing in the Tenderloin. Everyone anticipated that meeting this objective would not be easy, mainly b ecause there was not a primary care clinic in the Tenderlo in that qualified as a Medical Services Organization (MSO) , which is a Medi -Cal managed care requirement . Other concerns were the distance of the old CPMC campuses to the Tenderloin and the appropriate cultural and linguistic receptivity of those campuses for the diverse low -income Tenderloin population. The opening of the Van Ness Campus in March 2019 remedied any concern about proximity and provided new opportunities for CPMC to show the effectiveness of its CLAS polic ies. Yet, CPMC fails to present in the Compliance Statement any information about the extent to which the Van Ness Campus has provided services to Tenderloin residents , what measures it has taken to outreach to Tenderloin residents regarding the availability of services at the Van Ness Campus, and what specific design and operational decisions were made to further the development of the Van Ness Campus as a hospitable facility for a culturally and linguistically diverse population and how effective were those actions. As is past complianc e statements, CPMC does mention its working with St. Anthony's Medical Clinic in the Tenderloin , in particular, in facilitating a relationship between North East Medical Services (NEMS) as an MSO and St. Anthony's. CPMC also notes that it \"is the hospita l partner for one of St. Anthony's participating medical groups and will work with them to grow enrollment to 1,500 members.\" But, CPMC discloses nothing about how it is working with St. Anthony's to grow enrollment. Furthermore, also following its past compliance statement practices, CPMC provides no data about the number of Tenderloin residents newly enrolled and receiving services from CPMC on 5 referral from St. Anthony's or any other Tenderloin -serving medical clinic. In past years, it has been the Ci ty in its review of CPMC's compliance with the DA that has provided such data. The data is highly disappointing. The City found that in May 2019, St. Anthony's had 174 members (2 Healthy Kids and 172 in Medi -Cal) enrolled in the NEMS/CPMC partnership .3 This total number is two less than the number enrolled in May 2018. For the last several years, CPMC merely repeats the same few sentences it used the year before to describe its performance of Tenderloin -targeted obligations. It is not forthcoming in pr eparing its annual compliance statements . Much more devastatingly, CPMC is not constructively engaged in providing the kind of financial , technical , and organizational support St. Anthony's or any other Tenderloin pri mary care clinic needs to be fully fun ctional at a level capable of serving 1,500 Tenderloin residents. CPMC now has a state -of-the-art hospital next to the Tenderloin. Yet it continu es to shirk its promises and responsibilities to Tenderloin residents and San Franciscans generally. The commitment to serve 1,500 new Tenderloin Medi -Cal enrollees ends in three years and is in danger of becoming an empty promise. It was meant to be an ongoing responsibility. CPMC or another Sutter Health entity needs to step up and become an active and gener ous partner in the provision of primary care services in the Tenderloin . Similar expansions in Sutter Health services now exist in other City neighborhoods. The City must stop giving CPMC an unwarranted DA pass for its narrow , passive , and insufficient approach to meeting the healthcare needs of Tenderloin residents. CPMC has been similarly negligent in meeting the needs of San Francisco residents for sub - acute care. Except for a single passage that CPMC work with DPH and other San Francisco hospitals on a report regarding good faith efforts to provide sub -acute care in San Francisco, the DA is silent on CPMC's responsibilities in this critical service area. CPMC initially , and at times afterwards , speciously argued that the DA absolved it from any obl igation to provide sub - acute care services in San Francisco. Neither San Francisco public health officials nor members of the Board of Supervisors have accepted CPMC's preposterous argument and , throughout the DA monitoring period , have attempted to preve nt CPMC from closing the last remaining hospital -based sub-acute care unit in San Francisco and to have CPMC engage instead in seriously planning for providing its fair share of San Francisco sub-acute services . CPMC's response has been a half -hearted mea sure to provide sub -acute care services at the Davies Campus for a declining number of existing CPMC patients until they die or otherwise leave , and to refuse to commit to or plan for the ongoing provision of such services at one or more of its campuses. In 2019, several members of the Board of S upervisors made unannounced visit s to the Davies sub-acute care unit and witnessed firsthand the inadequate staffing and lack of timely responses from staff to patient needs. At this time, there are 8 remaining pa tients in the Davies sub -acute care unit. Once sub-acute care beds are no longer occupied, CPMC allows the state licensing for maintaining those beds to lapse. CPMC makes no mention of these facts in its Compliance Statement which , unsurprisingly, totally avoids acknowledging the extent of its responsibility for the crisis in the availability of sub -acute care services in San Francisco. 3 Annual City Report on CPMC LRDP Development Agree ment (Sept. 9, 2019), at p. 35. 6 For most of the period since the signing of the Development Agreement, San Francisco residents needing long -term sub -acute care have had to rely on facilities in other counties, sometimes as far away as Los Angele , at great psychological cost for them and their families and friends as well as increased financial cost s for th eir visitors. The tolls are also felt in the ab ility of family and friends to monitor sub -acute care treatment of loved ones and in the adverse impact on the quality of life of sub -acute care patients when visits from friends and family are infrequent. The soon pending total demise of sub-acute care services in San Francisco needs to be reversed immediately and requires a major collective effort from San Francisco hospitals and governmental bodies. So far, CPMC has been a reluctant , minimal participant at best. Its refusal to provide permanent sub -acute services is a major part of the problem. The City in its annual DA report must not let CPMC escape and evade its responsibilities . CPMC's Compliance Statement Presents Partial or Incomplete Information about Hiring Practices , Transportation Plan ning, and Healthcare Services System Impacts . In 2019, CPMC improved its coordination with the Office of Economic and Workforce Development (OEWD) in utilizing the First Source (FS) entry level hiring program. The results were that 58 of the 102 entry le vel employees hired by CPMC in 2019 and 23 of the 46 total hires in the first three months of 2020 came through the FS program, which means that they were San Francisco residents. These numbers exceed ed the 40% goal specified in the DA. CPMC further repo rted that 69% of the 2019 FS hires and 74% of the 2020 FS hires were from DA priority lower income neighborhoods. As in the past, CPMC offers no explanation of why its overall entry level hiring is much less than projections at the time of the DA's adopti on and fails to provide any information regarding the retention rate of new hires. In addition, CPMC ignores addressing the impact of the Covid -19 pandemic and the ensuing economic c risis on projections regarding available jobs. Instead, it submits as an exhibit a report prepared by OEWD and dated August 7, 2019, on CPMC positions currently filled, currently available, and projected to become available over the next 12 months. Such employment force projections should have been updated by CPMC before subm itting its compliance statement . Further, CPMC did not even bother to qualify or delete its reference in the entry level hiring summary to a very low unemployment rate as a continuing major challenge to its hiring efforts. Although t hese points are relat ively minor , they underscore the cavalier approach adopted by CPMC in meeting its DA obligations. With the opening of CPMC's two new campuses, construction hiring information is now only historically relevant. In that regard , it is important to note that in 2019 as for the past few years , CPMC fell short in meeting its goals for total hours worked by San Francisco residents (24% overall rather than 30%) and entry level positions for union apprentice candidates (30% rather than 50%). For this reporting cycle, CPMC hides behind the DA's weak good faith standard to support its claim that it is in compliance with DA provisions . The thrust of CPMC's response regarding the DA's emphasis on encouraging the use of public transportation and discouraging the use o f single occupancy vehicles is to report on findings 7 from two 2019 surveys , one conducted of employee/physician commuters and the other of patient/visitors. The employee/physician survey indicates little change in modes of transportation from the 2018 survey. Fifty -four percent of employees and physicians drive alone to and from work. A difference is that now close to 50 percent work at the Van Ness Campus. There also have been declines in the number of personnel residing in San Francisco and East Bay c ounties and increases in the number residing in South Bay and outlying areas. In 2019, 43 percent of CPMC staff lived in San Francisco. Although a DA requirement, the CPMC report contains no information regarding the use of Clipper Cards as subsidized by CPMC as a method of encouraging increased reliance on public transportation . The previous patient/visitor survey was conducted in 2016. The key comparative findings with the 2019 survey are that use of ride -hailing services ha s gone up by 3.5 percent, dr iving alone has decreased by 4 percent, and use of public transportation has gone down by 1 percent. On an issue of note not covered by the survey, CPMC nowhere addresses the usage of the large parking garages on the Van Ness Campus by nighttime neighborhood restau rant and entertainment patrons and the impacts of this new parking option on the surrounding streets and on modes of transportation other than private vehicle s used to visit neighboring nighttime destinations . To limit health insurance rate increases for San Francisco government employees as part of the City Health Services System , the DA capped the rate of annual increases CPMC can impose on employee benefit plans providing such insurance coverage. CPMC represents that the rate s of increases for 2019 were at or below the Medical Rate of Inflation plus 1.5% as compared to 2018 . CPMC d id not append an independent actuary report verifying its representation. It d id note that it did provide at the City's request independent actuary verification for the perio d between 2015 and 2017. It is incumbent that the City request a similar report for 2018 and 2019. The City's expenditures on employee benefits are huge. Time and again CPMC has shown that it is n either forthcoming nor candid in its compliance statement s. The City must be ever vigilant and seek further explanations and obtain , whenever appropriate, independent verification of CPMC's representations. Conclusion With the Covid -19 pandemic, an economic crisis of unusual magnitude, and widespread re - awakened and new awareness of the vast inequality and the depth of institutional racism within American society, all public and private decisions are now much more complicated and challenging than they were a year ago. Public health and the accessibility of healthcare services are especially central during these extraordinary times. The top manage rs of CPMC and Sutter Health have not been trustworthy players in meeting the healthcare needs of lower income San Franciscans. Their attention is t oo much on the financial bottom line. The next year is going to be especially trying for hospitals, operationally and financially. If CPMC adheres to its prior behavior under the DA, it will try to cut back further on the services provided lower income San Franciscans , particularly Medi -Cal beneficiaries. Now is the time for the City to invigorate its oversight of CPMC and certainly not to be maneuvered or lulled into lessening it. 8 Respectfully submitted on behalf of SFHHJJ, Mark N. Aaronson UC Hastings Community Economic Development Clinic Attorney for San Franciscans for Healthcare, Housing, Jobs & Justice 1 July 1, 202 1 By electronic submission to elizabeth.purl@sfgov.org Elizabeth Purl, Development Performance Coordinator San Francisco Planning Department 1650 Mission Street, Suite 400 San Francisco, CA 94103 Re: Comments of San Franciscans for Healthcare, Housing, Jobs & Justice (SFHHJJ) on CPMC's 20 20 Compliance Statement Dear Ms. Purl: SFHHJJ is a community -labor coalition that has worked to ensure that Sutter Health/CPMC's reconfiguration of its San Francisco campuses serves the interests of patients, workers, neighboring communities, and the City as a whole. Although not a party to the Development Agreement (DA) signed by the City and CPMC, SFHHJJ played a key role in shaping its outline and garnering suppor t on the Board of Supervisors for various mandated community benefits provisions . SFHHJJ has closely monitored the City's and CPMC's implementation of the DA and has participated in the compliance review process during all the past seven annual review cycles. With respect to the 2019 Compliance Statement review process , the City has yet to produce its Annual City Report, has not scheduled a joint hearing before the Health and Planning Commissions , has not issued a Certificate of Compliance, and ha s not disseminated the Third - Party Monitoring Letter. The issues raised in SFHHJJ's Comment Letter dated June 30, 2020, an electronic copy of which is included with this submission, have remained unaddressed and are still distressingly pertinent . In addi tion to the comments noted below, SFHHJJ references and incorporates last year's comments as part of this Comment Letter. CPMC Failed in 2020 to Meet the DA Mandated Medi -Cal and Charity Care Unduplicated Patients Baseline Commitment CPMC represents that it served 28,900 unduplicated Medi -Cal and Charity Care patients in 2020. This number is significantly less than the baseline commitment of 30,446 unduplicated patients set in 2013 based on the number of Medi -Cal and Charity Care pati ents represented as receiving services at CPMC campuses at that time. The 28,900 number is an adjusted amount . It reflects MARK N. AARONSON Professor of Law, Emeritus Community Justice Clinics UC Hastings College of the Law 200 McAllister Street San Francisco, CA 94102 aaronson @uchastings.edu (510) 504-4608 (cell) 2 a calculation made to account for CPMC's additional obligation in the DA to serve 5,400 new Medi -Cal managed care enrollees beyond the number included in the baseline commitment . Each year CPMC reports that it has provided services to a specific number of unduplicated Medi -Cal and Charity Care patients. For 2020, that number is 29,737. After the signing of the DA, t o reflect CPMC's pledge to serve 5,400 new M edi-Cal patients, CPMC and the City agreed to subtracting annually 837 patients from the actual reported patient number to arrive at the number to be used for determining compliance with the baseline commitment (29,737 - 837=28,900). The reasoning in support of t his methodolog ical adjustment is not provided as part of each annual compliance statement , is publicly unknown, and remains obscure. What is not obscure is that in 2020 , CPMC served notably fewer unduplicated Medi -Cal and Charity Care patients than it did in 2013. Specifically, it fell short of meeting the DA's required baseline commitment by 1,546 unduplicated patients. (A mathematical or typographical error in the Deloitte audit report says 1,549.) Its deficient perfo rmance in 2020 continues an alarming trend that began two years earlier. In 2019, CPMC represented that it served 35,456 unduplicated patients, which was almost 3,600 fewer patients than in 2018. This means that more than 10,000 fewer baseline countable patients were served in 2020 than 2018 \u2014a greater than 25 per cent drop -off. In reconfiguring its hospital campus structure in San Francisco, CPMC also has reconfigured its patient population so that contrary to the DA's very purpose, it now directly meets the hospital care needs of fewer and fewer Medi -Cal and Charity Care patients than it did before the openings of its two new hospitals . CPMC seeks to avoid sanctioning for its serious failure in 2020 to meet the healthcare service needs of low -income San Franciscans by using a rolling two -year average for determining baseline commitment compliance . Though permissible under the DA, this rationale does not justify CPMC's poor performance in meeting a major community benefit provision of the DA . Nor does its backup rationale regarding the disruptive effects of the Covid -19 pandemic. If anything, CPMC should have been outreaching more to San Francisco's low -income population during a catastrophic public hea lth crisis. Instead, CPMC invokes yet another assessment measure in the DA that is structurally flawed to escape being held accountable for not meeting its promises and obligations. CPMC Continues Its Lack luster Performance in Meeting DA Obligations regarding Healthcare N eeds of Tenderloin Residents and Entry Level Job Hires In its 2020 Compliance Statement, as in the past, CPMC responds mechanically and unreflectively to its reporting obligations regarding DA provisions seeking to redress in adequate healthcare accessibility for Tenderloin residents and to further the hiring of San Francisco residents from low -income neighborhoods for entry level CPMC jobs . SFHHJJ's DA comments regarding these matters made last year are referenced here a s they are still pertinent. Especially disheartening is t he lack of any reported progress in meeting the neighborhood clinic and hospital care needs of 1,500 new Tenderloin Medi -Cal beneficiaries. For e ach of the past 3 several years, including this one, CPMC has submi tted on a summary compliance chart the same short written statement , the thrust of which is to excuse itself from any responsibility for the lack of progress in meeting this target . Most glaringly, CPMC provides no specific data about the number of new beneficiaries being served. Instead, such data has been made publicly available only in the City 's Annual DA Report . Since no such Report regarding CPMC's 2019 Compliance Statement is yet forthcoming , the latest number available is from the City's Annual Report dated September 9, 2019. In that Report , the drafters noted that in May 2019 , St. Anthony's Medical Clinic , the one DA authorized primary care clinic in the Tenderloin, had on its rolls only 174 Medi -Cal Managed Care patients , two less than the year before and far short of the 1,500 -patient commitment . Updated Tenderloin patient numbers are likely to be similarly disappointing. There is only a little more than two years left before CPMC's responsibilities under the DA for increasing and enhancing healthcare services for Tenderloin residents come to an end. It is time to come up with alternative arrangements for CPMC to meet full y its DA responsibilities for expanding healthcare services in the Tenderloin neighborhood. Those alternatives could include substantial new cash contributions from CPMC to upgrade the capacity of Tenderloin primary care clinics and establishing and promoting new, culturally and linguistically accessible, outpatient services at the Van Ness Ca mpus targeting Tenderloin residents. Rather than passively accepting CPMC's excuses for not meeting the DA's Tenderloin healthcare service obligation s, City officials need to obtain now from CPMC a substitute package of community benefits that would have a neighborhood impact equivalent to serving ongoingly 1,500 Tenderloin low -income patients. With respect to entry level hiring, CPMC's performance remains significantly below representations made during the DA negotiations because it over -projected the number of positions that would need to be filled. While most years CPMC has met the DA's 40% local hire goal, the number of actual hires has been relatively small. In 2020, CPMC made 64 entry level hires , 32 of whom were referred by San Francisco 's First Source program thereby satisfying the required goal . The projections are not as promising f or 2021. For the first four months of this year, CPMC has made 21 entry level hires . Only 6, which is 29% of those employed , so far have been First Source candidates. To meet the target percentage, CPMC needs to intensify its local hire efforts during t he remainder of the year. Even then, the results will be much less than originally anticipated at the time the DA was negotiated. To place in perspective CPMC's under -performance regarding entry level local hires, the initial draft of the DA set as a ta rget the hiring of 40 San Francisco residents. Based on CPMC's projections, which now can be seen as undeniably highly inflated, this absolute number was changed to 40% , the purpose being to increase , not reduce, the number of local entry level hires. This change made at the City's behest is in retrospect obviously a mistake but one that has resulted in significantly lessening C PMC's commitment to and performance in employing San Francisco residents. 4 Notwithstanding the Fundamental Purpose of the DA, CPMC since 2013 Has Retreated from and Not Expanded Its Healthcare Services for Low-Income San Franciscans Not only has CPMC skirted or minimally complied with its healthcare service obligations under the DA, it also has used the rebuil ding and restructuring of its hospital campuses authorized by the DA as opportunities to back out of service areas viewed as unprofitable or not sufficiently profitable. The most publicly protested action has been its 2017 decision to close the 40-bed sub-acute care unit within the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) at the St. Luke's Hospital campus , now rebuilt and renamed the Mission Bernal Campus. As a result of organized community and patient family pressure and the intervention of the Board of Supervisors, CPMC agreed to maintain a temporary sub-acute care unit on the Davies Campus until the last transferred patient die s or otherwise leaves. CPMC ceased taking new long -term sub -acute care patients in late 2016 . There are now fewer than 10 patients in the Davies sub -acute care unit. When it closes, there will be no sub - acute care facilities in San Francisco. Long -term sub -acute care patients have severe disabilities and r equire 24 -hour nursing attention and life -supporting equipment, such as ventilators. At this time, San Francisco residents requiring such care are placed in facilities in other counties, often far from supportive family members and friends. San Francisco Department of Health officials estimate that San Francisco should have licensed and operational approximately 65-70 sub -acute care beds to meet the likely demand for sub -acute care for San Francisco residents. Most long -term sub -acute care patients are o n Medi -Cal, which most hospitals view as providing insufficient fee reimbursements for the services extended. This financial disincentive should not hold sway. CPMC as the largest private fee -for-services healthcare provider in San Francisco and as a tax -exempt charitable organization must be made, and has the resources, to do its fair share in providing permanent facilities in San Francisco for the provision of long-term sub -acute care. CPMC's favored approach for ending its direct responsibilities for providing services largely utilized by low -income San Franciscans is to transfer management and operation of those services to other entities, usually with some short -term subsidies. These reductions in services have come before the Health Commission in Proposition Q hearings, which entail public notice and comment but involve no sanctions. The most the Health Commission can do is to issue a finding that a hospital's decisions to terminate or reduce services will have a \"detrimental impact\" on healthcare services in San Francisco. Proposition Q authorizes no further enforcement. While the DA Compliance Review process in practice has been toothless, the Proposition Q hearings are legally t oothless. Since 2013, CPMC has initiated Proposition Q hearings fo ur times. The first was in 2014 less than a year after the signing of the DA and was a prelude to its decision to end providing sub -acute care at any of its campuses. The 2014 action invo lved a cutback in and reconfiguration of SNF services , the main results of which were an overall reduction of staffed , general SNF beds from 99 to 75 and the closure of the SNF unit on CPMC's then California Campus. 5 The second in the latter half of 2017 addressed the closure of the entire SNF unit at St. Luke's Hospital, which included the termination of the sub-acute care services described above and the closure of 39 staffed, general SNF beds. In 2013, CPMC had authorization for 212 licensed SNF beds, though less than half of which were staffed. Today it has only 38 SNF beds on the Davies Campus, some of which now temporarily serving as sub-acute care beds. The third Proposition Q proceeding began in summer 2018 and covered CPMC's closure of the Swindells Alzheimer's Residential Care and Day Care programs on the California Campus and the transfer of management of five outpatient clinics from CPMC to Sutter Pa cific Medical Foundation, another Sutter Health affiliate. The termination of the Residential Care program resulted in the loss of 10 residential care beds in San Francisco for individuals with dementia or Alzhe imer's. The day care program served 70 undu plicated patients and found space elsewhere. It is now operated and funded exclusively by the Institute on Aging. The transferred outpatient clinics included the Diabetes Center, the Breast Health/Mammography Center, and the Non - Invasive Cardiology Clini c on the St. Luke's now Mission Bernal Campus. These transfers in management are a striking symbolic change in St. Luke's historical legacy and ethos of providing culturally supportive, highly integrated medical services. The fourth invocation of the Pr oposition Q process by CPMC occurred earlier this year. It involved the closing of the Mission Bernal Adult and Pediatric Clinics. These clinics now are solely operated by the Mission Neighborhood Health Center. What all these changes have in common is that they reduce CPMC's direct responsibilities for healthcare services that are not sufficiently financially remunerative. CPMC views itself as primarily providing tertiary and quaternary hospital care. Unlike t hose levels of care, which consist of financially lucrative medical specialties , providing community responsive primary and secondary care is financially taxing. CPMC wants to lessen as much as possible its provision of healthcare services that adversely affect its financial bottom line . Contrary to the underlying spirit of the DA , CPMC continually maneuvers to shift the direct and indirect financial burden s for meeting primary and secondary care service s needs to others, including the City and County of San Francisco. Conclusion A major reason for t he CPMC Development Agreement was to prevent the closure of St. Luke's Hospital. While it has been physically rebuilt, it also is being operationally reconstructed in the image of CPMC's other campuses. Each year the Mission Bernal Ho spital drifts further from the role played by the old St. Luke's Hospital as a welcoming healthcare center for San Franciscans, especially low -income residents. At the same time, CPMC's Van Ness Campus has yet to live up to the DA's expectations regarding contributions to the much -needed enhancement of healthcare services in the adjacent Tenderloin neighborhood. CPMC's delivery of in -kind community benefits as stipulated in the DA continues to be abysmal. 6 Respectfully submitted on behalf of SFHHJJ, Mark N.
