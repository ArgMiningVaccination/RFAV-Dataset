And uninsured recipients will not be charged, but we may seek reimbursement from the government. The administrative fee allows us to continue to provide this important service to our community, like other vaccine providers, we will be asking for insurance information when anyone comes to us for their vaccination. We will also be contacting others who had previously received their inoculation to seek reimbursement of our costs. Thanks for your help in supporting our efforts.
