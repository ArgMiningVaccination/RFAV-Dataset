The flyer, seen by The Feed, claims that autoimmune diseases and low vitamin D, zinc and B12, all \"increase the probability of having an adverse reaction to COVID vaccines.\" It also notes \"shedding of the spike protein is... of particular concern for vaccinated breastfeeding mothers\", \"there are concerns around female fertility\" and the vaccine is \"not recommended during pregnancy.\" The flyer goes on to recommend a keto or Mediterranean diet several weeks before vaccination, as well as a range of vitamins and supplements to protect against \"adverse side effects\" of the vaccine. It also suggests that its Mullum Herbals Easy Cleanse is an ideal way to minimise risk factors before being vaccinated. A customer posted the flyer on Facebook out of concern after visiting Mullum Herbal in Mullumbimby. \"Went into Mullum Herbals today as I'm getting Pfizer next week and wanted to get some immune system herbs to take before,\" the customer wrote. \"Was unsure of their stance on the vaccine but this handout shocked me... I can imagine many locals sitting on the fence about the vaccine... only to be given this blatant misinformation.\" The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president Dr Karen Price emphasised the importance of getting health advice from qualified professionals. \"The 'information', and I use the term loosely, in this flyer is completely wrong and potentially dangerous,\" Dr Price told The Feed. \"I strongly recommend customers throw their copy in a recycling bin and urge anyone spreading similar misinformation to leave health advice to the health professionals - including GPs.\" Stock image of a woman at a herbal store.

Instead, he sent some written responses to our questions via email. The owner stressed that Mullum Herbs does not promote \"anti-vaccine ideas\". \"We are a small rural business trying our best to support the local community in their needs during these trying times,\" the owner responded. \"Our store provides a natural health service to the local community. Our philosophy is that maximising health is a safeguard from the potential ill effects of vaccines and viruses.\" The owner said the flyer was prepared to address \"many of the questions\" being asked around the issue of possible side effects of the vaccines. \"The flyer is given to customers who visit our business and ask if there is anything that they can do to minimise possible side effects from the vaccines.\" One local told The Feed she was \"upset\" and \"disappointed\" when she saw the Facebook post about the flyer. Victoria said that Mullum Herbals is a much-loved business in the community that has attained \"relative stature and trust\" from locals. She said she's been a customer of the store for years, purchasing \"nit potions\" and \"tonics for coughs\". \"That flyer, I see it as being highly dangerous. It's sad because it really erodes your love of Mullumbimby to see stuff like this,\" she said. \"I'm so disappointed to think what the effect is. To me, [it's] creating fear "}
