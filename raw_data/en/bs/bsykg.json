You can awaken this divine [feminine energy](/articles/embrace-sacred-power-shakti) through different practices involving movement, meditation, and breathwork. Derived from the Sanskrit word kualin, meaning \"coiling snake,\" this way of life has a serpent sense to it, according to [Verywell Mind](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-kundalini-meditation-4688618#:~:text=What%20Is%20Kundalini%3F,mantras%2C%20asanas%2C%20and%20meditation.). If you're familiar with this work, you'll understand the relationship between this serpent energy and the power it embodies. Awakening kundalini energy can be a life-changing and transformational experience. Here are some everyday [kundalini](/articles/what-is-kundalini-yoga-and-how-to-awaken-the-energy-within) practices for daily life for you to try so that you can begin harnessing the power within. And the best part about it is that you can choose how much or how little time to spend on each, meaning that you can fit them into your daily schedule. Lotus Yoga Pose Kundalini yoga is one of the most common types of Kundalini practices of all time. There are a variety of specific yoga poses that activate kundalini energy; the [lotus pose](/articles/5-flow-yoga-poses-inspired-by-water) is one of them, according to the [Yoga Journal](https://www.yogajournal.com/practice/yoga-sequences/kundalini-yoga-sequence-find-courage/). And if you're new to kundalini practices, this is a great place to start. To begin, come to a comfortable position on the floor with your spine tall while bending your knees inward to a cross-legged position. The key here is to ensure that your feet are resting on the inner thighs, up by the groin area. Place your hands gently on your knees, palms facing downwards to ground your energy. When you focus all your attention on the bottom of the spine, you gently awaken your kundalini energy. Kirtan Kriya Meditation Known as kriyas Sanskrit, kirtans are songs, and kriyas are movements. Memory-related areas of the brain can be activated and improved through Kirtan Kriya meditation, making it a feasible practice in adults with early memory loss, according to [Psych News Daily](https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/kirtan-kriya-may-preserve-cognitive-function-in-alzheimers-patients/). During the Kirtan Kriya meditation, you chant Saa Taa Naa Maa for twelve minutes while repeating finger movements, called [mudras](/articles/5-yoga-mudras-for-strength), to awaken kundalini energy.. In doing so, internal healing can occur as the mind, body, and emotions are in sweet harmony. Breath of Fire The natural breath guides you through life, allowing you to live each day to its fullest. Practicing breathwork has endless benefits and is becoming more popular today. A specific technique that you can practice to truly embody Kundalini energy is [Pranayama](/articles/try-these-breathing-exercises-for-every-mood), also known as breathwork. In particular, the breath of fire can ignite the kundalini energy while also delivering health benefits such as boosting your immune system to prevent illness and disease, according to [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/breath-of-fire-yoga). The breath of fire focuses on rhythmic pumping with short bursts of inhales and exhales. With every exhale, you are pulling the navel toward the spine and with every inhale, the navel relaxes and goes back to neutral.s This breathing method encourages kundalini energy to flow upwards and through your entire body, creating fire within. Chakra Visualisation Kundalini visualization can be used to explore the [seven chakras](/articles/what-are-seven-chakras-comprehensive-introduction) and promote healing from the base of your spine to the crown of your head. Those who practice Kundalini visualization experience feelings of rising energy within, which transcends through each chakra, according to Verywell Mind. Start by imagining a bright light at the base of the spine, at the [Mldhra chakra](/articles/root-chakra-healing-how-to-open-your). Consciously allow this bright light to travel up through your chakras, spending just a few moments on each, devoting your attention to the color linked to the specific chakra. Once you reach the crown chakra, repeat this process again for as long as you feel called to. Using Kundalini Shakti in this way invites you to heal. Imagine your day aligned with your highest self as you feel into every element of this energy. Ishnaan Hydrotherapy shnaan therapy is a method of cold water therapy linked to kundalini that repairs cell tissue and boosts immunity. Ishnan, an Indian term, that refers to the point where your body temperature is warmer than the water's coldness, according to [Solid Glow](https://solidglow.com/2012/07/30/ishnaan-the-science-of-hydrotherapy/) channel. Ishnaan hydrotherapy promotes endorphins, the pleasure hormone, so not only are you treating your body to the health benefits that come with it, but you'll also feel great afterward! Before you enter the [cold water](/articles/cold-shower-a-day-could-keep-doctor-away-1), you must first rub pure oil all over your body, gently massaging it in circular motions. After this, immerse yourself in the cold water by hopping in and out four times, massaging the oil each time you're out of the water until you no longer feel cold. Health benefits include strengthening the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, eliminating toxins and poisonous wastes, and cleansing the aura while producing powerful energy. "}
