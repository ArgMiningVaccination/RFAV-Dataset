Will I recover from a hepatitis B infection? Most healthy adults who are newly infected will recover without any problems. But babies and young children may not be able to successfully get rid of the virus. Adults - 90% of healthy adults will get rid of the virus and recover without any problems; 10% will develop chronic hepatitis B. Young Children - Up to 50% of young children between 1 and 5 years who are infected will develop a chronic hepatitis B infection Infants - 90% will become chronically infected; only 10% will be able to get rid of the virus. What is the difference between an \"acute\" and a \"chronic\" hepatitis B infection? A hepatitis B infection is considered to be \"acute\" during the first 6 months after being exposed to the virus. This is the average amount of time it takes to recover from a hepatitis B infection. If you still test positive for the hepatitis B virus (HBsAg+) after 6 months, you are considered to have a \"chronic\" hepatitis B infection, which can last a lifetime. Will I become sick if I have acute hepatitis B? Hepatitis B is considered a \"silent infection\" because it often does not cause any symptoms. Most people feel healthy and do not know they have been infected, which means they can unknowingly pass the virus on to others. Other people may have mild symptoms such as fever, fatigue, joint or muscle pain, or loss of appetite that are mistaken for the flu. Less common but more serious symptoms include severe nausea and vomiting, yellow eyes and skin (called \"jaundice\"), and a swollen stomach - these symptoms require immediate medical attention and a person may need to be hospitalized. How will I know when I have recovered from an \"acute\" hepatitis B infection? Once your doctor has confirmed through a blood test that you have gotten rid of the virus from your body and developed the protective antibodies (HBsAb+), you will be protected from any future hepatitis B infection and are no longer contagious to others. What should I do if I am diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B? If you test positive for the hepatitis B virus for longer than 6 months, this indicates that you have a chronic hepatitis B infection. You should make an appointment with a hepatologist (liver specialist) or gastroenterologist familiar with hepatitis B. This specialist will order blood tests and possibly a liver ultrasound to evaluate your hepatitis B status and the health of your liver. Your doctor will probably want to see you at least once or twice a year to monitor your hepatitis B and determine if you would benefit from treatment. Most people chronically infected with hepatitis B can expect to live long, healthy lives. Once you are diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B, the virus may stay in your blood and liver for a lifetime. It is important to know that you can pass the virus along to others, even if you don't feel sick. This is why it's so important that you make sure that all close household contacts and sex partners are vaccinated against hepatitis B. What tests will be used to monitor my hepatitis B? Common tests used by doctors to monitor your hepatitis B include the hepatitis B blood panel, liver function tests (ALT), hepatitis B e-Antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B e-Antibody (HBeAb), hepatitis B DNA quantification (viral load),and an imaging study of the liver (ultrasound, FibroScan [Transient Elastography] or CT scan) biopsy before starting treatment. Is there a cure for chronic hepatitis B? Right now, there is no cure for chronic hepatitis B, but the good news is there are treatments that can help slow the progression of liver disease in chronically infected persons by slowing down the virus. If there is less hepatitis B virus being produced, then there is less damage being done to the liver. Sometimes these drugs can even get rid of the virus, although this is not common. With all of the new exciting research, there is great hope that a cure will be found for chronic hepatitis B in the near future. Visit our [Drug Watch](treatment-and-management/drug-watch/) for a list of other promising drugs in development. Are there any approved drugs to treat chronic hepatitis B? Current treatments for hepatitis B fall into two general categories: - Immune modulator Drugs - These are interferon-type drugs that boost the immune system to help get rid of the hepatitis B virus. They are given as a shot (similar to how insulin is given to people with diabetes) over 6 months to 1 year. - Antiviral Drugs - These are drugs that stop or slow down the hepatitis B virus from reproducing, which reduces the inflammation and damage of your liver. These are taken as a pill once a day for at least 1 year and usually longer. There are currently 7 approved drugs in the United States for adults living with chronic hepatitis B infection. These include 5 types of antiviral drugs that are taken as a pill once a day for 1 year or longer. And there are 2 types of immune modulator drugs called \"interferon\" that are given as an injection for 6 months to 1 year. Oral Antivirals (Nucleos(t)ide Analogues) - Tenofovir disoproxil (Viread) is a pill taken once a day, with few side effects, for at least one year or longer. This is considered a first-line treatment with an excellent resistance profile. (Approved in 2008) - Entecavir(Baraclude) is a pill taken once a day, with few side effects, for at least one year or longer. This is considered a first-line treatment with an excellent resistance profile. (Approved in 2005) - Telbivudine(Tyzeka or Sebivo) is a pill taken once a day, with few side effects, for at least one year or longer. This is considered a second-line treatment option. (Approved in 2006) - Adefovir Dipivoxil(Hepsera) is a pill taken once a day, with few side effects, for at least one year or longer. This is considered a second-line treatment option and patients must have their kidney function monitored regularly. (Approved in 2002) - Lamivudine(Epivir-HBV, Zeffix, or Heptodin) is a pill that is taken once a day, with few side effects, for at least one year or longer. This is generally not used in the U.S. because it is less potent than the newer drugs and most people develop drug resistance within a year or two. (Approved in 1998) Immune Modulators (Interferons) - Pegylated Interferon(Pegasys) is given by injection once a week usually for 6 months to 1 year. The drug can cause side effects such as flu-like symptoms and depression. (Approved in 2005) - Interferon Alpha (Intron A) is given by injection several times a week usually for 6 months to 1 year, but treatment can be longer. The drug can cause side effects such as flu-like symptoms, depression, and headaches. This is an older drug that is not used as often. (Approved in 1991) Do these drugs provide a \"cure\" for chronic hepatitis B? Although they do not provide a complete cure, except in rare cases (a \"cure\" means that a person loses the hepatitis B virus and develops protective surface antibodies), they do slow down the virus and decrease the risk of more serious liver disease later in life. If I have a chronic hepatitis B infection, should I be on medication? It is important to understand that not every person with chronic hepatitis B needs to be on medication. You should talk to your doctor about whether you are a good candidate for drug therapy. Whether you and your doctor decide you should start treatment or not, you should be seen regularly by a liver specialist or a doctor knowledgeable about hepatitis B. Is it safe to take herbal remedies or supplements for my hepatitis B infection? Many people are interested in using herbal remedies or supplements to boost their immune systems and help their livers. The problem though is that there is no regulation of companies manufacturing these produces, which means there is no rigorous testing for safety or purity. So the quality of the herbal remedy or vitamin supplement may be different from bottle to bottle. Also some herbal remedies could interfere with your prescription drugs for hepatitis B or other conditions; some can even actually damage your liver. These herbal remedies will not cure a chronic hepatitis B infection. There are many companies that make false promises on the Internet and through social media about their products. Online claims and patient testimonials on Facebook are fake and are used to trick people into buying expensive herbal remedies and supplements. Remember, if it sounds too good to be true, then it's probably not true. Below are reliable sources of information about herbs and alternative medicines. This information is based on scientific evidence, not false promises. Check whether the active ingredients in your herbal remedies or supplements are real and safe for your liver. The most important thing is to protect your liver from any additional injury or harm.

People living with chronic hepatitis B infection may or may not need drug treatment. But there are many other things patients can do to protect their liver and improve their health. Below is our list of the top 10 healthy choices that can be started today! - Schedule regular visits with your liver specialist or health care provider to stay on top of your health and the health of your liver. - Get the Hepatitis A vaccine to protect yourself from another virus that attacks the liver. - Avoid drinking alcohol and smoking since both will hurt your liver, which is already being injured by the hepatitis B virus. - Talk to your provider before starting any herbal remedies or vitamin supplements because some could interfere with your prescribed hepatitis B drugs or even damage your liver. - Check with your pharmacist about any over-the-counter drugs (e.g. acetaminophen, paracetamol) or non-hepatitis B prescription drugs before taking them to make sure they are safe for your liver since many of these drugs are processed through your liver. - Avoid inhaling fumes from paint, paint thinners, glue, household cleaning products, nail polish removers, and other potentially toxic chemicals that could damage your liver. - Eat a healthy diet of fruit, whole grains, fish and lean meats, and lot of vegetables. \"Cruciferous vegetables\" in particular -- cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower -- have been shown to help protect the liver against environmental chemicals. - Avoid eating raw or undercooked shellfish (e.g. clams, mussels, oysters, scallops) because they could be contaminated with a bacteria called Vibrio vulnificus, which is very toxic to the liver and could cause a lot of damage. - Check for signs of mold on nuts, maize, corn, groundnut, sorghum, and millet before using these foods. Mold is more likely to be a problem if food is stored in damp conditions and not properly sealed. If there is mold, then the food could be contaminated by \"aflatoxins,\" which are a known risk factor for liver cancer. - Reduce your stress levels by eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, and getting plenty of rest. Keep in mind everything you eat, drink, breathe, or absorb through the skin is eventually filtered by the liver. So protect your liver and your health. Can I donate blood if I have hepatitis B? No. The blood bank will not accept any blood that has been exposed to hepatitis B, even if you have recovered from an acute infection. "}
