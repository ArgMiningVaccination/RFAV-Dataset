Adult 2015 2016 8Disparities In Adult Immunization Rates Lower vaccine coverage among1 Hispanics and African Americans compared to non - Hispanic Caucasians Uninsured Lower incomes Improve frequency of provider vaccine assessment and recommendations may help reduce disparities For newly insured adults Affordable Care Act ( ACA) requires non -grandfathered private plans to include coverage for ACIP - recommended vaccines Especially important to conduct assessment among newly insured 9 1. Lu, P -J, et al. Am J Prev Med 2015Challenges Vaccine coverage among adults is unacceptably low Limited patient awareness about need for vaccines among adults Adult vaccinations less integrated into clinical practice Opportunities Most patients willing to get vaccinated when recommended by medical providers Primary care providers believe that immunizations are an important part of the services they provide to patients Systematic offering and recommendations from clinicians result in higher uptake Hurley, et al. Annals of Internal Medicine, 2014. Guide to community preventive services: www.thecommunityguide.org/vaccines/index.html Adult non- influenza vaccine coverage: www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6305a4.htm . 10Key Adult Immunization FactsAdult Immunization Practice Standards Stresses that all providers, including those that don't provide vaccine services, have a role in ensuring patients are up -to-date on vaccines Acknowledges that: Adult patients may see many different healthcare providers, some of whom do not stock some or all vaccines Adults may get vaccinated in a medical home, at work, or retail setting Aim is to avoid missed opportunities and keep adult patients protected from vaccine- preventable diseases 11Adult Immunization Practice Standards Calls to action for healthcare professionals Assess immunization status of all patients in every clinical encounter. Strongly Recommend vaccines that patients need. Administer needed vaccines or Refer to a provider who can immunize. Document vaccines received by patients, including entering immunizations into immunization registries. http:// www.publichealthreports.org Even if you don't vaccinate, you still need to recommend vaccines to your patients 12Adult Immunization Practice Standards Formally supported by healthcare organizations: -American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) -American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA) -American Academy of Family (AAFP) -American College of and Gynecologists (ACOG) Physicians (ACP) -American Pharmacists Association (APhA) -Association of Immunization Managers (AIM) -Association of State & Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) -Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) -Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) -National Association of County & City Health Officials (NACCHO) -National Foundation for Infectious Diseases (NFID) 1314Immunization Practice Standards Implementation Assessment Implement protocols and policies. Ensure that patients' vaccine needs are routinely reviewed and patients get reminders about vaccines they need . Ask patients about their vaccinations during clinic visits E.g. Include a form at check -in and communicate with patients before seeing the provider about which vaccines might be needed Make sure that the systems in your clinic are setup to optimally support the standards implementation E.g. Your clinic's EHR includes the immunization module, and immunization prompts/health maintenance forms/clinical decision guidelines are activated and updated periodically to reflect the current adult IZ schedule www.cdc.gov/vaccines/AdultStandards 15Immunization Practice Standards Implementation Assessment: Coverage Reports Adapted from \"EHR Best Practice Workflow Guide for HPV Vaccinations in NextGen \u00ae Ambulatory EHR\", American Cancer http://hpvroundtable.org/wp- 16Report Description Intent Details Vaccine -specific statistical analysis Patients who received the vaccine(s) in a specific time range Use this report to track activity, analyze providers, and determine month over month dose administration or trends. Daily vaccinations Vaccine dose reconciliation Include patient information, vaccine dose details, administration details, status. Target population vaccination for a certain vaccineIdentify patients who are not up - to-date on a specific vaccination or have not completed a vaccine series Include last vaccine date (for series) , last appointment date or missed appointment, patient contact information. Use this report to follow up on series completion, if applicable. Apatient recall report can be used to identify this patient population. Missed opportunities Target population seen in a time range but not given the vaccine Criteria includes: age or condition for subpopulation of patients with any type of visit, no vaccine order for vaccine in question, and patient not up to date on series, if applicable.

Use the SHARE framework when providing important information to help patients make informed decisions about vaccinations: Share tailored reasons why vaccination is right for the patient. Highlight positive experiences with vaccination. Address patient questions and concerns. Remind patients that vaccines protect them and their loved ones against a number of common and serious diseases. Explain the potential costs of getting sick. www.cdc.gov/vaccines/AdultStandards 20Immunization Practice Standards Implementation Administer needed vaccines or refer Develop standing orders or protocols for vaccine administration Ensure practice is up- to-date with vaccine storage and handling Develop relationships with pharmacies, health departments, and other vaccination providers to refer your patients for vaccines you don't stock www.cdc.gov/vaccines/AdultStandards 22Immunization Practice Standards Implementation Document vaccines received by patients Document receipt of vaccine in electronic medical records Provide patients with vaccine documentation for their personal medical records, e.g. shot card Follow- up with patient or referring provider to document the vaccine given Enter immunization doses to state immunization registries www.cdc.gov/vaccines/AdultStandards 23Improving Use of Immunization Information Systems -CA Immunization Registry CAIR Increase use important for many reasons, including Ensuring patients get the right vaccines at the right time Tracking vaccination rates Potential for use in quality measures and coverage tracking In pediatrics, use of IIS known to improve vaccination Improves readiness to respond to emergencies like 2009 H1N1 Challenge: limited use by adult providers (e.g. 8% internists)1 CAIR online resources http ://cairweb.org/ 1.

Testimonials from Immunization Action Coalition and CDC websites Pertussis: Callie stopped breathing again. Family members watched helplessly from behind a glass wall as doctors tried for 45 minutes to revive her. Tragically, Callie could not be saved. She was only 5 weeks old. \"We never dreamed we'd lose her,\" Katie said. \"Callie was a more loved, more wanted baby than you'd ever find.\" CDC websiteCDC/ Patricia Walker, M.D., Regions Hospital, MN 27Courtesy MN Oxman San Diego VAMCConclusions Substantial burden of disease in adults for which vaccines available Vaccination rates low among adults in U.S. Adult Immunization Practice Standards updated and supported by wide range of provider organizations Implementation of standards is key to increasing awareness of adult immunization, improving vaccine coverage, and reducing racial and ethnic disparities in vaccine coverage Many tools and resources available to: Help providers implement practice standards Educate patients on the importance of vaccination 28VFA Program Updates 1.
