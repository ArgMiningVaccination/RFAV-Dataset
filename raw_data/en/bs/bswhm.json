ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 5 fic.tufts.edu I. Executive Summary In May 2018, this report was presented by the Feinstein International Center, Tufts University, as evidence at the International Criminal Court (ICC) trial of former Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) commander, Dominic Ongwen, in the case Prosecutor V. Dominic Ongwen. Ongwen has been charged with 70 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in attacks on civilians in four internally displaces persons (IDP) camps, Abok, Lukodi, Odek, and Pajule in northern Uganda. The research was com missioned by the Legal Representatives for Victims, which represent the 2,605 victims with status before the court in this case. Methods The report presents findings from the Victimization Assessment survey carried out in February 2018 with a representativ e population -based sample of the victims of the LRA attacks on Abok, Lukodi and Odek. We compare this victim population to the general population of Acholi and Lango sub -regions who have not experienced any war crimes and crimes against humanity using data from the Secure Livelihoods Research Consortium (SLRC), Uganda survey. The SLRC survey data are representative of the entire population of Acholi and Lango sub -regions. The comparison between the general population of Acholi and Lango who are war-affected but have not experienced war crimes and crimes against humanity, with the victims in the case Prosecutor V. Dominic Ongwen gives us insight into how the alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during LRA attacks in Abok, Lukodi and Odek may have impacted the victims as individuals and their households, and what this means for their wellbeing and overall recovery . Key Findings War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity S uffered For each of the victims, we collected data on the experience of individual war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed by the LRA in attacks carried out at camps for internally displaced people at Abok, Lukodi, and Odek. We collected information on: attacks directed against civilians; killing or wounding a inhumane acts; conscription and use in hostilities of children under 15 years of age; pillaging; and destruction and appr opriation of property. Among the victim population, the three most commonly experienced crimes were i) 95% were present when the LRA carried the attacks on the camp; ii) 89% had their property destroyed or stolen by the LRA; and iii) 87% had a family membe r killed by the LRA during the attacks. On average, respondents experienced 6.9 war crimes and crimes against humanity as a result of the LRA attacks. Even children, new born to five years old at the time of the attack, experienced, on average, 4.7 war crimes and crimes against humanity. Respondents who were deprived of their liberty and forced to engage in acts of a sexual nature experienced 13 war crimes and crimes against humanity on average. This crime was experienced equally by both men (11 percent of respondents) and women (13 percent of respondents). In comparison, data from the entire war -affected population of Acholi and Lango sub -regions show that over the 20+ years of the war, individuals in these regions experienced an average of 0.34 war crim es and crimes against humanity. On average, each household in the victim population experienced 22 war crimes and crimes against humanity during the three attacks. This finding is remarkable when compared to the average household in Acholi and Lango, which experienced 2.3 war crimes and crimes against humanity over the course of the war. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 6 fic.tufts.edu Psychosocial Effect We find a significant relationship between the LRA attacks on the three IDP camps and impaired psychosocial functioning in both male and female responde nts from those camps. Compared to men, women had significantly greater rates of depression, anxiety, and somatic complaints without medical causes. In particular, forced sexual acts and having a child while in LRA captivity resulted in increased impairment of the respondent compared to those respondents without such experiences. Physical Effect and Access to Resources Two -thirds of the victims reported having a disability, and for half of them their disability \"affects their ability to work a lot\" or they \"cannot work at all\". Disability affects both the victim and their household. Households affected by the attacks have, on average, two people with a disability. The high level of disability is partially reflected in the high dependency ratio: 70 percent o f people affected by attacks are dependents. In other words, if a household has 10 members, 7 are dependents. This high dependency ratio makes it difficult for households to earn enough to support themselves and access the resources they need. Compared t o the general population in Acholi and Lango, it takes households that experienced the attacks significantly longer to reach a health clinic; they are significantly less likely to go to a clinic that has the services they need for routine and serious health problems; and they are significantly less likely find the necessary services and medication available in the clinics. Further, households who suffered the most war crimes and crimes against humanity have the worst access within the affected population. T his difference in access and quality of services slows recovery. Asset Wealth The victims of the attacks have significantly less wealth and lower earning and income potential compared to the general household population in the region. Food Security Victims' households have significantly greater food insecurity as compared to the general population in the region. Of all the variables, the number of disabled individuals has the greatest relationship with increasing household food insecurity. Furthermore, vi ctims who were deprived of their liberty and forced to engage i n acts of a sexual nature have significantly worse food security than the victims who did not suffer this particular crime. Access to School Boys and girls living in households affected by th e attacks are significantly less likely to attend school every day compared to their same -sex peers in the region. Importantly, boys and girls of victims who had either been sexually assaulted or abducted during the attacks have significantly lower school enrollment and attendance. Only 29 percent of children living in a household of someone who was abducted during the attacks are enrolled in school. Notably, 0 percent of girls and 9 percent of boys who live in a household of a respondent who had been sex ually assaulted during the attacks attend school every day. The combination of the high numbers of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the LRA and the resulting physical injury and disability, poorer mental wellbeing, the stripping and des truction of their assets, and their reduced ability to carry out livelihoods has resulted in these households being unable to afford to enroll and keep their child attending school. Thus, we predict poor outcomes for their children's education and human capacity development. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 7 fic.tufts.edu Access to Potable Water Access to clean water is important to prevent child illness and poor nutrition (e.g., stunting) associated with negative long- term cognitive and physical development. The victims have significantly less access t o potable water compared to the general population of Acholi and Lango. Already high levels of stunting (32 percent) in northern Uganda combined with significantly lower levels of food security, education, access to health services, and potable water among the population affected by the attacks, leads us to predict poor future health and diminished physical and cognitive development among their children. Access to Livelihoods and Social Protection Services Fifty -seven percent of the victims' households are receivin g livelihood services and 30 percent are receiving social protection services. However, respondents reported receiving one or less services a year. Given the needs highlighted above, this indicates the response is falling short of meeting their needs. Importantly, there is no correla tion between the experience of war crimes and crimes against humanity and/or disability and receiving either social protection or livelihood services, or the number of services they receive. In fact, we found that many of the most vulnerable households ar e not receiving any services. Desire for Justice and Reparation Victim participants have a strong desire for justice. For many, justice includes recognition of the wrongdoing committed against them, punishment for those found guilty, deterrence against fut ure atrocities , and direct reparations. Respondents stressed the need for rehabilitation, therapeutic care, livelihood support, financial restitution and compensation, and educational provision for their household members. II. Report Objectives The objectives of this report are to: Document the physical, material and psychosocial effect of harm suffered by victims as a result of the crimes committed during attacks and abductions allegedly orchestrated by Dominic Ongwen. Assess the immediate and repercussi ve effects on the victims and their households. Determine the presence and possible impact of government and humanitarian agency services that have been undertaken support victims and their households. Recommend appropriate responses to the various categor ies of victimization identified. Throughout the report, when we use the term \"victim participant' or `victim participant population' (VP) we mean the 2,605 victim participants with status before the court in the case Prosecutor V. Dominic Ongwen. When the report refers to 'the general population' (GP) it means the population statistics of respondent and/or households that come from the Secure Research Livelihoods Consortium (SLRC), Uganda survey that did not experience a war crime or crime against humanity . III. Background In early 2015, 2 ,605 living victims nominated two lawyers to represent them in the case against Dominic Ongwen , which is currently ongoing before the International Criminal Court (ICC). The Legal Representatives for Victims (LRV) were consequently appointed by the C ourt and later granted legal aid to support their case. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 8 fic.tufts.edu Following a January 2016 confirmation hearing, 70 charges were confirmed against Dominic Ongwen including attacks against the civilian population in Northern Uganda, m urder, attempted murder, torture, cruel treatment, enslavement, pillaging, destruction of property, persecution and other inhumane acts which were allegedly committed in four former IDP camps. The 2 ,605 clients who were granted the right to participate in this case were located in several villages and parishes near Odek, Abok and Lukodi trading centers. Counsel representing victims have a duty to present the views and concerns of their clients at different stages of the proceedings, where the victims' pers onal interests are affected. This has to be done in a manner that is not prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial trial. In this regard, during presentation of the victims' case, Counsel may call witnesses to testify. The LRV hired the services of a team of expert s to conduct an independent, in-depth assessment of the victims' experiences before, during and after the attacks in issue. The assigned individuals present their findings in this report that they shall present and defend before the C ourt as expert evidence.

DOMINIC ONGWEN 11 fic.tufts.edu IV. Methodology To meet the objectives of this report, the study draws on two original quantitative surveys, original qualitative research, and rel evant secondary publications. A. Survey Research The quantitative findings draw from two separate surveys. The first survey i s the Victimization Assessment Survey carried out with a representative population -based sample of the victim participants with status before the C ourt in the case Prosecutor V. Dominic Ongwen from Abok, Lukodi and Odek. These are victims from alleged LRA at tacks that occurred on or around 29 April 2004 at Odek IDP camp, 19 May 2004 at Lukodi IDP camp, and 8 June 2004 at Abok IDP Camp. For the rest of this report, we will refer to these victims as \"victim participants\". We then use data from an existing surve y that is representative of entire population of Acholi and Lango sub - region - Secure Livelihoods Research Consortium (SLRC) - from the same region (see Map 1) and carried out in the same time period in order to compare the victim participant population to the population who have NOT experienced a crime against humanity or war crime . In this section, we present information on the survey content, timing and location of the surveys, data collection, and sampling starting with the SLRC survey followed by the Victimization Assessment survey. We then discuss how we carried out the analysis combing both surveys.

DOMINIC ONGWEN 12 fic.tufts.edu A1. Survey Content, Data Collection and Sampling Secure L ivelihoods Research Consortium S urvey Data from the SLRC Uganda survey is derived from a panel survey (carried out in January and February 2013, 2015 and 2018). Panel surveys ask the same questions to the exact same people and households over time, which enables the researchers to track and measure change over time (usually several years) and understand why those changes are occurring . Panel surveys among conflict -affected populations are extremely rare due to the difficulty in tracing the exact same individual and their households over several years, given high rates of displacement, mov ement and elevated rates of mortality. We use the SLRC Uganda survey because , to date, it is the only panel survey of northern Uganda that: i) is representative of the entire post- war population s in Acholi and La ngo sub -regions; ii) has a focus on alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity ; iii) links those alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity to people and their household's livelihoods, food security, access to education, health and water, and receipt of livelihood or social protection services. Furthermore, because our team designed, oversaw and participated in every step in the entire data collection, data cleaning and data analysis, we are highly confident in the data and the findings of the SLRC Uganda research. The SLRC Uganda has undergone peer -review prior to all its publication, which are all available on line. To ensure transparency, all data from the SLRC Uganda is available for public viewing and use, and is hosted on the World Bank's website (see http://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/catalog/2256/data_dictionary XXX). (See also the supplemental materials of this report for a copy of the full SLRC Uganda survey.) The SLRC Uganda survey was funded b y the Government of the United Kingdom, Irish Aid and the European Union (for more information see https://securelivelihoods.org/). We use the SLRC Uganda 's data on households not affected by alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity from 2018 to compare the larger populations of Acholi and Lango to the victim participants in Abok, Lukodi and Odek. We do this to better understand the impact of the alleged crimes suffered by the victim participants in Abok, Lukodi and Odek . The secti ons covered by SLRC Uganda 2018 survey and used in this current report include the following modules: Household composition and demographics Experience of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity Food security Assets Basic services (health, education, and water) Social protection and livelihood services In January and February 2018, a team of surveyors was employed by Dr. Mazurana to carry out the interviews for the SLRC, Uganda survey. Teddy Atim was the team leader on the ground for the entire testing, training and carrying out of the SLRC, Uganda survey. A group of 40 surveyors and 6 team leaders carried out the data collection. Preparation for the data collection consisted of a 5 -day training, the purpose of which was to familiarize surveyors with the objective of the survey, the content of the survey instrument, and the ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 13 fic.tufts.edu use of electronic tablets for data collection using the same Open Data Kit (ODK) platform. ODK is an open source data collection and management platform. Fieldwork for the SLRC, Uganda survey was carried out between January 15, 2018 and March 5, 2018. The data is representative of approximately 1.5 million people in Acholi and 2.1 million people in Lango for a total of 3.6 million people covering the two sub -regions in northern Ugan da most affected by the conflict between the Government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army (see Map 1 above) . To achieve a power of 0.80 while still being representative of the sub -region level (Acholi and Lango), the SLRC, Uganda study required 40 clusters with at least 768 households per sub -region. T o select households, a two-stage cluster sample stratified by sub -region strategy was employed for the SLRC, Uganda study, wherein clusters (i.e., sub- counties) were selected in the first stage and households within those clusters in the second stage. Probability Proportion to Size (PPS) sampling was carried out to generate the number of sub - counties sampled in each district (i.e., a greater number of sub- counties were selected from districts with larger populations and a smaller number of sub -counties from distri cts with smaller populations) for a total of 80 sub -counties or clusters, 40 per sub -district. The sub -counties were randomly selected, and from each sub - county one village was randomly selected. In each village, approximately 20 households were randomly selected so that the results would be representative and statistically significant at the sub -regional level covering every district in the two sub -regions. Data was collected from 1,516 households 79Fi across the two sub - regions with information on the househo ld head. 80Fii However, in this report we only focus on the sub -sample of households who reported NO exp erience of a war crime or crime against humanity . Thus, the final sample size and breakdown by gender in the SLRC survey is presented in Table 1 below. Table 1: SLRC sample by gender of respondent Male Female Total Total 296 533 829 Households were randomly selected by spinning a pencil on the ground to point the surveyor to walk in a randomized direction for a random number of minutes. If no one was home, the pencil was re -spun to randomly select another direction and household. The surveyor surveyed one household member over the age of 15 who was able to provide informat ion on behalf of the household. All analysis accounts for the research design effect , which mean s the analysis accounts for the fact that we first randomly selected villages and then randomly selected households in those villages. This is different from just having a list of households to select from because there is an assumption that individuals liv ing in the same village are more similar to each other than individuals living in different villages. They might be of a similar ethnic group, of live a similar distance from a health center, etc. Just like people in the same family likely have more similarities to other people in their family than to people in other families. Thus, because the sample was selected by first selecting villages and then households in those villages we control for that possible similarity of households coming from the same vill ages by letting the data analysis program know that that is how we selected our sample Informed oral consent was obtained from all participants, with opportunities for the interviewee to decline participation prior to and during the interview. Interviews were conducted in private. Data identifying the ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 14 fic.tufts.edu household was removed and kept separate and secure from the data collected on the household. Every effort was made to ensure confidentiality and to reduce any negative consequences to the participants. Survey participants did not receive any material compensation. All participants were offere d a list and contact information of organizations in their sub -region that specialized in services for victims of violence and referrals were made upon request. Tufts University Institutional Review Board (IRB) provided ethical approval for the study. 0F1 These ethical standards are to protect the rights and welfare of people who participate in research activities carried out under the authority of Tufts University. 1F2 1 As part of full disclosure, Dr. Dyan Mazurana serves as a Board Member of the Tufts IRB Board and in this capacity carries ou t IRB reviews of research for Tufts Medical School, Tufts Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts School of Arts and Sciences, Tufts School of Engineering, and Tufts Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy. When research protocols that Mazurana is involved with are under review she recuses herself, a s per Tufts IRB protocol. 2 Specifically, these ethical standards include: The risks to human research subjects are minimized by using procedures that are consistent with sound research design and that do not unnecessarily expose the research participants to risk. The risks to human research subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated benefits (if any) to the individual, and the importance of the knowledge that may be expected to result. o For the purpose of IRB consideration, \"benefit\" is defined as a valued or desired outcome; an advantage. o For the purpose of IRB consideration, \"risk\" is defined as the probability of harm or injury (physical, psychological, social, or economic) occurring as a result of participation in a research study. o In evalu ating risk, the IRB is to consider the conditions that make the situation dangerous, per se (i.e., as opposed to those chances that specific individuals are willing to undertake for some desired goals). In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB considers o nly those risks and benefits that may result from the research (i.e., as distinguished from risks and benefits of treatments or procedures that the patient would undergo if not participating in the research). o In evaluating risks and benefits, the IRB does not consider possible long -range effects of applying knowledge gained in the research (e.g., the possible effects of research on public policy). The selection of human subjects for research participation is equitable. Human research subjects are adequately informed of the risks and benefits of research participation and the procedures that will be involved in the research; and that informed consent is obtained from each prospective human research subject, or his/her legally authorized representative, in acc ordance with, and to the extent required by federal regulations and IRB policies. Informed consent of human research subjects is obtained in advance of research participation and appropriately documented in accordance with, and to the extent required by federal regulations and IRB policies. The research plan makes adequate provisions for monitoring the data collected to ensure the safety of human research subjects. There are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of human research subjects and to maintain the confidentiality of research data. Appropriate additional safeguards have been included in the study to protect the rights and welfare of human research subjects who are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence (e.g., children, pregnant women, decisionally impaired persons, or economically or educationally disadva ntaged persons).

All publications to date from the SLRC, Uganda research were externally reviewed by subject experts prior to publication. Victimization Assessment Survey The Victim Assessment survey was carried out exclusively on a representative population from the 2,605 victim participants in the case Prosecutor V. Dominic Ongwen . The goal of the Victimization Assessment (see Annex B for full instrument) was to identify the abuses allegedly suffered , and their physical, material and psychosocial effects on the population. The respondents hail from villages and parishes surrounding the Odek, Abok, and Lukodi trading centers (see Map 1 above). To be able to compare across the two surveys, the Victimization Assessment survey used the same wording of the questions for eac h module as the SLRC survey . Exception s include some components of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity (see A nnex D for how the alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity questions were asked in the SLRC survey) and the psychosocial assessment. The wording for some of the alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity was amended from the SLRC , Uganda survey to better 3 Atim, Teddy, Dyan Mazurana and Anastasia Marshak, 2018, \" Women Survivors and Their Children Born of Wartime Sexual Violence in Northern Uganda,\" Disasters: The Journal of Disaster Studies, Policy and Management 42 (S1): S61- S78; Levine, Simon.

DOMINIC ONGWEN 16 fic.tufts.edu capture elements of war crimes and crimes against humanity regarding attacks against the civilian population in Northern Uganda, murder, attempted murder, torture, cruel treatment, enslavement, pillaging, destruction of property, persecution , and other inhumane acts which were al legedly committed in the three former IDP camps. In addition, the Victimization Assessment survey sought to understand the psychosocial wellbeing of the victim participants. A psychosocial approach examines how the combined influence of social environme nts and psychological factors (such as people's thoughts, minds, emotions, and behaviors) influence people's physical and mental wellbeing and their ability to function. A psychosocial approach is used within a wide range of professions, and by researcher s in medicine, the social sciences, the natural sciences, and philosophy, among others. Therefore, the Victimization Assessment survey included an African Youth Psychosocial Assessment (AYPA), which was not carried out in the SLRC , Uganda survey (see Anne x B for the full AYPA tool). The AYPA was developed and tested by the Department of Global Health and Population at the Harvard Public Health & Francois -Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights specifically for use among Luo speakers in northern U ganda. 3F4 The AYPA was informed by qualitative interviews with war - affected youth, formerly abducted and non -abducted, as well as identified key informants (elders, traditional healers, health professionals, and caregivers of war -affected youth) living in t he Awer and Unyama IDP camps of Gulu District in Northern Uganda. 4F5 These interviews resulted in the identification of locally defined syndromes that aligned with western conceptions of mental health and included culturally specific elements as well. In cho osing a psychosocial assessment for use in this report it was deemed vital to utilize an assessment that would identify the presence of distress and resilience while considering the unique cultural context of the Acholi and Langi people. All survey questio ns were translated into the local language Luo, back translated, and pilot tested to ensure accuracy. We report on both the full AYPA scale, as well as its subscales: depression/anxiety, conduct problems, pro - social behavior, and somatic complaints without medical cause. The AYPA is comprised of 40 statements that assess a participant's demeanor over the previous week. Participants are then asked to rate the statement on a scale from 0 to 3, with 0 meaning \"Never\" and 3 meaning \"All the time\". We dropped one question regarding `play with others' given the age range of the population for a total of 39 state ments. The AYPA can be further broken down into four subscales: depression/anxiety (19 statements), conduct problems (10 statements), pro -social behavior (7 statements), and somatic complaints without medical cause (3 statements). The AYPA results in a total AYPA score and a score for each subscale. The total AYPA score includes all subscales except for the prosocial subscale. Therefore, the total AYPA score includes 32 statements and can range from 0 to 96. A subset of the best surveyor s the list of 2018 SLRC surveyor s was selected to participate in the Victimization Assessment survey. Atim selected the best surveyor s 2018 SLRC surveyors based on their prior experience and performance in working with victims of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity ; their past experience and proven commitment as researchers; their demonstrated ability to maintain confidentially and be respectful of victims. The surveyor s had been through previous five-day training on th e instrument and 4 Betancourt, T. S., F. Yang, P. Bolton and S. L.

ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 17 fic.tufts.edu protocol for implementing the SLRC survey. Their p reparation for the Victimization Assessment survey data collection consisted of a n additional two-day training, with a focus on sensitivity, the AYPA, and alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity section of the survey. Importa ntly, all surveyor s had already been trained on the other modules a month prior for the SLRC data collection. All data collection was carried out in and around the villages and parishes surrounding the Odek, Abok, and Lukodi trading centers. Respondents were randomly selected by the research team ( see details below) . Those selected by the research team were contacted by the LRV to determine whether they would be able to participate in the independent Victimization Assessment survey. Once the respondents a greed (all those contacted agreed to participate) , they were assigned a day for the interview and were reimbursed by their lawyers for their travel. They were interviewed one- on-one by the surveyor s in private in locations near their homes. Data collection took 12 days from February 20 to March 4 , 2018. All data collection was carried out on Digital Data Gathering (DDG) devices. The instrument was programmed to run on the application ODK , which allows data to be collected while offline and then uploaded v ia Internet connection to the server - in this case we hosted the data on the ODK platform using Google's App Engine. The research team was provided a deidentified (meaning no names, just unique respondents IDs) list of all clients in this case by their ge nder and location by the legal team. Based on this, the research team randomly selected respondents from the full list . The research team then sent the selected list of unique respondent IDs to the legal team to contact for interviews . Thus, the identities of the victims were not disclosed to the research team . In addition, during the field interviews a member of the LRV was there to confirm that each person who showed up to be interviewed was in fact a victim participant, and that their name corresponded with the assigned number identification given to them by the LRV and used by the Tufts research team. The member of the LRV then introduced each victim participant to the surveyor using only their assigned number identification, which was recorded by the interviewe r. In order to report on key outcome indicators (such as disability) with a 5 percent margin of error and 95 percent confidence interval, the survey required a sample of 400 respondents. Given the varying size of client number s in the three loca tions, a PPS sampling strategy was employed . This means that a larger number of respondents were selected from the site where a larger number of clients lived and a smaller number from the sites where a smaller number of clients lived. In addition, the sam ple was stratified by gender (i.e., equal number of female and male respondents) so as to allow disaggregation by gender in the analysis w here appropriate. Finally, to account for non- response, an additional 5 to 10 percent of respondents were selected from each site. See Table 2 for the breakdown of selected respondents by site and gender. Table 2: Sample size by site and gender Site Male Female Total Abok 67 70 137 Lukodi 99 92 191 Odek 33 35 68 Total 199 197 396 ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 18 fic.tufts.edu An important note on the Lukodi sample: the field team had a very difficult time reaching 70 of the original 140 respondents randomly selected to take part in the survey in Lukodi . According to the survey manager, mobilizer, and local leaders, some of the missing respondents were not residents of Lukodi but had been present during the attack. In other cases people reportedly had migrated looking for other ways to survive. Some reportedly were in the hospital due to being unwell, while others were at the hospital caring for sick relatives. Some reportedly were in schools not located in the communities. Some women were separated or divorced and had left the area. Thus, to reach the desired sample size an additional 70 replacement respondents were randomly s elected from the remaining list in Lukodi (to make up for the 70 respondents that could not be located) . The need to draw on a second sample might only introduce bias into the data if there is something about these missing respondents that is correlated to more or less experience of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity . In such a case, the bias could be that people who experienced more alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity were unavailable , or people who experienced fewer alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity were unavailable. However, given the reasons noted previously ( e.g., sick relatives, schools not in communities, migrated for work, returned to their original homes when they left the IDP camps) as to why some people w ere no t available, we do not find that experiencing more or less alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity is the primary reason they were unreachable. Thus, we are confident that the final sample is a sound representation of the victim participant communit y living in this region . The Victimization Assessment survey did not go through an IRB process 5F6 because it was determined by Tufts IRB that it did not quality for human subject review because it was specifically conducted for a court case , and not as part of human subjects ' research . Because an IRB process is in place to ensure the rights of human subjects of research are protected and they are not put at risk, Tufts decision not to have the Victimization Assessment Survey undergo an IRB has no effect on the study's findings or conclusion. Nonetheless , because we wanted to ensure the rights and safety of our research subjects, the team still designed and carried out the study in -line with Tufts IRB protocol. In specific , the study was designed and carrie d out to minimize risks t o research participants; ensure an equal possibility of participation by all victims with legal status before the Court in Prosecutor V. Ongwen; human subjects were informed of the risks and benefits of participation in the project; prior to beginning the research, informed consent was obtained from each human research subject, and that consent was documented; data collection was designed and monitored to ensure the safety of the human subjects; and adequate provisions were made to protect the privacy of human research subjects and to maintain confidentiality of research data. No material incentives were given by the research team to p articipants . The only thing given to participants on site by the LRV was a bottle of water or soda to drink while they waited, as many had traveled longer distances to reach the site s and no water was available on the site s of the interviews. A2. Analysis For the analysis, this report presents descriptive statistics on the victim participants, who also serve as the main respondent s. In this report we present the means with 95 percent confidence intervals. The reason for this is that we want to be able to show the size of the uncertainty that comes from estimating the population mean from a sample mean. W hile we surveyed 396 randomly selected client victims for this report we want to be able to provide data representative of the full population (2,605) of victim participants represented in 6 See footnote 2 for an explaination of what ethical standards studies are required to meet under the IRB. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 19 fic.tufts.edu the case P rosecutor V. Dominic Ongwen . Confidence intervals are how we can account for the uncertainty of using data on 396 people to represent the information of 2,605 people. For example, the data shows that 67 percent (Table 10) of the victim participant population experienced a disability with a 95 percent confidence interval of 62 to 72 percent. That means that if we repeated this study 100 times, every time taking a different 396 random people from the population of 2,605 people, 95 of those times the data would show that somewhere between 62 and 72 percent of the po pulation is disabled and it is precisely in this sample of 296 people that that percentage happens to be 67. Thus, confidence intervals are important to accurately represent the certainty that we have in the findings coming out of this data. In addition, for measures of food security, wealth and access to services we compare the experience of the victim participants to the general population in Acholi and Lango sub -region (from the SLRC survey), who did NOT experienc e a war crime or crime against humanity . We do this in order to better ga uge the possible impact of the attacks against the victim participant respondents and their households ' lives and livelihoods (see Table 1 for SLRC sample size used for this report) . To carry out this analysis, t -tests are run to compare the experience of the two populations. A t -test is a statistical procedure that is used to determine if the mean of one population (our victim participants ) is statistically different from the mean of another population (the general population). As we mentioned before, when you are using a sample to tell you something about the whole population it is not enough to just visually compare the means of the two populations and say which one is bigger. For example, if the data shows that 70.1 percent of girls in the victim population were enrolled in school compared to 69.6 percent of girls in the general population (Table 14) you cannot come to the conclusion that more girls are enrolled in the victim popul ation than in the general population unless you run a t-test. A t -test takes into account the additiona l bit of uncertainty that comes when we use a sample mean to tell us something about a population mean. In this case, the t- test tells us that the 2 perc entages are too close to each other (with overlapping confidence intervals) to say they are statistically different. In the final section, we also compare the experience of the victim participants who reported receiving external social protection or livelihood support on the key outcome indicators using t- tests. To better understand how female and male clients might differ in their experience, the sampling strategy and the analysis (w here appropriate) are disaggregated by the gender of the respondent and co mpared using t - tests. Finally, where possible , we also highlight the experience of the women who gave birth to a child that resulted from sexual relations with a member of the LRA. For all the analysis, a difference with an alpha value of 10 percent or be low was considered significant. STATA 13 , a statistical analysis tool, was used for all analysis. 6F7 Two sets of weights were applied in the analysis. Weights are a value assigned to each case in the data file used to make the sample statistics more representative of the population. As discussed in the data collectio n section, while we used PPS sampling to originally determine the number of respondents i nterviewed at each site, the final sample size fell slightly below the original calculation. Thus, we applied weights to the data at each site so that the final sample is completely representative of the victim participant distribution by location. 7F8 7 STATA is a statistical software package that allows the user to manage and analyze data: https://www.stata.com/stata13/ 8 For example, we wante d to sample a total of 194 households in Lukodi according to the PPS sampling strategy, but sampled only 191. However, we still wanted the data of the 191 respondents to have the same weight as the data from 194 respondents to stay true to our original PPS sampling strategy. So, each response from Lukodi was applied a weight of 1.02 ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 20 fic.tufts.edu In addition, while the data collection was stratified by gender to allow us to compare the experience of men versus women, gender weights were applied to the whole sample to make it representative of the full client list. Table 3 shows the breakdown of gender b y location for the complete client list that was used as the basis for calculating gender weights in the data. This is the same approach as with the location weights above. For the sample we tried to make sure that we had as close to an equal number of women and man sampled from each location to allow us to present data on women separately from men with the same level of accuracy. However, the distribution of victims from the full client list was not equally distributed by gender (Tabl e 3). But, we wanted to make sure that when we are presenting total percentages they reflect the full population client list. So, weights were applied to reflect that distribution. For example, in Lukodi, only 48 percent of our sample was women, but 56 per cent of the victim client population from Lukodi was women. Thus, each response from a woman in Lukodi was given a weight of 1.16 (1 / (number of women sampled/number of women that should have been sampled to be 56 percent of the sample). Thus, all statisti cs on the full sample are representative of the victim participants with respect to location and gender. Table 3: Gender breakdown by location of clients Gender Site Location Female (%) Male set of indicators, we present a table with notation indicating the significance (if any) of the difference. When we us e the term significance we mean the probability that the relationship or difference between two populations we are seeing in the data happened by chance. Something is statistically significant when the difference is larger than can reasonably be explained by chance alone. There are different levels of statistical significance that are described using a p -value . The p -value is the probability of finding the observed difference if the observed di fference did not actually exist; t hus, the smaller the p -value, the more significant the difference. For example, wh en we show that the p -value is 1 percent it means that 1 percent of the time the relationship you are seeing is by chance; if the p -value is 10 percent it means that 10 percent of the time the relationship you are seeing is by chance, and so on. Thus, we are more confident that a relationship exists when the p -value is small. For our analysis, we use a cut -off of 10 percent and only call a relationship significant if there is a 10 percent chance or less that the relationship is due to randomness or chance. We use the following notation: one notation (ex: *) means it was significant at a p- value of 10 percent, two notations (ex: **) means it was significant at a p -value of 5 percent, and three notations (ex: ***) means it was significant at a p- value of 1 percent. (1/(191/194)=1.02) to make up for the missing 3 respondents. The same approach was repeated with the other sites so that while the sample was a little smaller than intended each location still constributed the same proportion to the total mean calculation so as to remain as representative as possible of the full client victim population in this case. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 21 fic.tufts.edu In the tables and figures, the re port uses VP for 'vi ctim population' when describing the population represented by the Victimization Assessment survey and GP for 'general population' when describing the population represented by the sub -sample of the SLRC survey that did not experience a war crime or crime against humanity . B. Qualitative Research The qualitative data was collected through one -on-one, in -depth interviews with 16 of the victim participants with status before the court in the case Prosecutor V. Dominic Ongwen from Abok (four participants), Luk odi (eight participants) and Odek (four participants). The number of participants chosen reflects the size of the study population in each site. The qualitative aspect of the study was designed to purposefully select victim participants from the larger V ictim Assessment Survey (detailed above) for in -depth interviews. The survey team was trained to look for people who had experienced different kinds of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity , were different ages (a range of young to old), and diffe rent sexes. They were then to recommend a diverse array of victim participants for in- depth qualitative interviews with the head of the team, Teddy Atim. This was done to ensure that a range of different people and experiences were covered in the in -depth qualitative research, and that our sample was not biased towards particular populations (e.g., so we didn't end up interviewing all abductees, or only females that experienced sexual violence, or mostly men overall ). To reduce possible bias in providing i nformation in the survey, victim participants were not told at any point during the survey that they may be selected for additional interviews. The purposive selection of victim participants for our in- depth qualitative research followed accepted research protocol within the social sciences: i) a small number of participants was studied intensively; ii) the participants were purposefully chosen; i ii) the rationale for selection was determined and followed; iv) and the selection was conceptually driven by our theory that different sexes and ages of people would experience different crimes and have different short and long -term outcomes as a result. 8F9 Our purposive sample generated rich, dense, focused information on the research questions to allow our researcher team to provide a convincing account of what we sought to study, in this case, the harms suffered and their effects on the victim participant population. To ensure consistency in the qualitative interview process, Teddy Atim carried out all qualitative interviews. Atim is a native Luo speaker and conducted all interviews in the local languages. Atim used a semi- structured research guide (s ee Annex C for full instrument) to guide the interviews. The research guide questions were translated from English into the local language, back translated, and pilot tested to ensure accuracy. The qualitative research collected data on the following: Experience during the alleged attacks and types of abuse suffered; How suffering such violence affected the victim and the victim's household's: ability to carry out livelihood; wealth and assets; ability to send children to school; relations with family and community; land access; housing access; water access; physical and mental health and access to healthcare; ability to maintain the family and changes in community life; Access to any kind of livelihood support or social protection services; Access to any k ind of justice for abuses suffered. 9 Curtis S., Gesler W., Smith G. & Washburn S, (2000), Approaches to Sampling and Case Selection in Qualitative Research: Examples in the Geography of Health. Social Science & Medicine 50(7 -8), 1001- 1014. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 22 fic.tufts.edu Atim collected all qualitative data in this study in the areas surrounding Abok, Odek and Lukodi from February 20, 2018 to March 4, 2018. Data were analyzed using codes established prior to the research, which enabled a deeper understanding of the data collected in the survey modules (described below). V. Results In this section, we present the findings from the V ictimization Assessment survey carried out with the victim participants from Abok, Lukodi and Odek . We then compare the victim participants to the general population of Acholi and Lango sub -regions that has NOT experienced alleged war crimes or crimes against (using data from the SLRC , Uganda survey) . The comparison between the general population of Acholi and Lango who are war affected but have not experienced alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity with the victim participants gives us better insight into how the alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during alleged LRA attacks in Abok, Lukodi and Odek may have impacted them and their households, and what this means for their wellbeing and overall recovery . Within the se results, where relevant, we focus on the experience of people who the LRA deprived of their liberty and forced them to engage in one or more acts of a sexual nature , abductees and women who gave birth to a child conceived due to sexual relations with an LRA member . A. War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity Expe rienced For each of the victim participants, we collected data on the experience of individual alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed during LRA attacks on the Abok, Lukodi and Odek IDP camps (Table 4). The alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity we collected information on include those listed below if they were carried out by a member of the LRA during the attack, or for those abducted by the LRA, following the attack: attacking civilians; killing or wounding sexual taken against your will (abduction) other inhumane acts; conscription and use in hostilities of children under 15 year s of age; pillaging; destruction and appropriation of property. Recalling that our findings are representative only of the 2,605 victim participants with status before the Court in the case of Prosecutor V. Ongwen , we found that 95 percent of the victim pa rticipant population reported being present when the LRA allegedly carried out one of three attacks against civilians at the IDP ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 23 fic.tufts.edu camps. The next two most com mon experiences of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity include the destruction or theft of property by the LRA (experienced by 89 percent of the population), and killing of a member of the family (not including a spouse or child) by the LRA during the attack (experienced by 87 percent of the population). There were some important and statistically significant differences in these crimes associated with the gender of the respondent. Women were significantly more likely to have been present during the LRA attack on civilians. They were also twice as likely (10 percent for women versus 5 percent for men) to have a member of the LRA commit a sexual act against them or forced them to engage in a sexual act. However, men did report experiencing sexual assault by the LRA as well. Women were also significantly more likely to report the death, delibera te injury, or/and abduction of their spouse. And women were almost twice as likely to report the abduction of their child (19 percent of women versus 11 percent of men reported this crime). Men, on the other hand, were significantly more likely to report h aving to participate in direct combat. They were significantly more likely to have been forced by the LRA to seriously injure or kill another person. And they were significantly more likely to report that a member of the LRA deliberately injured a close family member (not a spouse or child) who was not taking part in combat. Ninety -nine percent of respondents experie nced more than one war crime or crime against humanity and we explore below how the interaction among the various alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity compounds the harms the person and their household suffers.

We exclude destruction and theft of property because this particular crime was the most commonly experienced crime by both the general and victim population: over half of the households in the general population and 95 percent of the households in the victim population reported experiencing this crime . Considering how common the experience of this particular crime was, we felt that excluding households from our 'general population' for experiencing a crime that was felt by over half of the northern population would overly limit our analysis and no longer allow us to refer to that population as 'general'. For comparability across the victim and general population sample we applied the same criteria to our victim population. On average, the victim participants experienced 6.9 alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity as a result of the LRA attacks against the three IDP camps (with no diffe rence by gender) (Table 5). We can recognize the magnitude of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity experienced by the population in Abok, Lukodi and Odek when we compare their result s to the findings from the SLRC Uganda survey. The SLRC Uganda survey found that over the 20+ years of the war, individuals in Acholi and Lango sub -regions experienced an average of .34 alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity , with those who reported experienci ng a war crime or crime against humanity averaging 2.5 alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity (Mazurana et al., 2014) (Figure 1). In other words, victim participants experienced, on average, 20 times more war crimes and crimes against humanity than the average person in Acholi and Lango sub- regions. In all figure s and tables VP stands for victim participant population (from the Victimization Assessment Survey) and GP stands for general population (from the sub- sample of the SLRC survey population that did not experience a war crime or c rime against humanity .

The rebels twisted his head until they broke his neck and then threw him between the huts in the camp. He was then burnt to death. I ran for my life with my youngest child. My other little child, a girl who was three year s old at the time, remained inside a hut as the rebels set fire to the camp. She was just standing there as the hut was burning. She was young and too confused to even try to run off. Her head was burnt and one side of her body was burnt. She was only res cued by someone who was hiding nearby and who came and pulled her away. But she was already severely burnt.\" - Female adult interviewee from Abok (HH ID 208) \"I was displaced into Abok camp during the war with my wife but our children were away. I had take n them to live with my wife's family in Ngai, a neighboring sub county here. On the day of the attack, I was shot on both legs. The rebels caught me and took me to the LRA leader of the attack who was being called Lapwony. He was seated on chair somewhere on the side of the camp. He ordered his soldiers to beat me. They left me there. I was later found by people returning to the camp after the attack on the next day. My wife was also caught and beaten severely by the rebels.

The older the respondent at the time of the attack the more alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity the individual experienced. However, it is important to note that children aged zero to five years at the time of the attack still experienced, on average, 4.7 alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity . Therefore a child aged zero to five during the time of the LRA attacks on the Abok, Lukodi, and Odek IDP camps, on average, has 14 times more experi ences of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity than does the average person who went through the 20+ year war in Acholi and Lango sub -regions. The victim participants who were children during the LRA attacks on the three IDP camps spoke to us ab out the ways in which they and their families were seriously harmed. \"I was a young child during the attack. My mother told me that an LRA rebel grabbed me and kept hitting me against trees and bushes, trying to kill me by pounding me this way. The rebel l eft me for dead, but I did not die... The LRA also abducted my uncle, my mother's brother, and he was later killed. He never returned and those who did return said he had been killed.

Our house and some of our property was burnt, other properties were looted. My sister's child who lived with us was shot and killed duri ng the attack. Her other child was abducted. My older brother was also abducted by the rebels and never returned to date. I was told by those who escaped from the rebels that he was killed. After the attack my family fled and had to live in another IDP camp.\" - Male adult interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 4) The LRA showed no mercy in their attacks, killing the young and the old, and stripping them of their assets, as this narrator explains. \"Our home in the camp was by the roadside. It was about 6:00 pm w hen we heard the whistle being blown and after a short while, we heard gunshots. We were scared and confused. We didn't know what to do, people either ran off or went inside their huts to hide. But we decided to run off away from the camp. But one of my brothers- in-law went back to carry a child who was left inside the hut. As he was coming out with the child, he met the LRA in the compound and he was shot dead. The rebels threw the child back in the burning house and the child was burnt to death. We foun d their bodies in the morning, the next day when we returned to the camp. All our huts were burnt down and property destroyed. All the goods they [the rebels] could carry, they looted and took it with them before setting the huts ablaze with the few remai ning items inside. They took bags of maize, beans, sorghum, dried cassava, rice, and some cassava.

Twenty -eight percent of all respondents reported being abducted, 30 percent of females and 26 percent of males (Table 6). Respondents who were abducted reported experiencing twice as many alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity as those who were not abducted (11 crimes versus 5 crimes for non -abductees) (significant at p<0.01).

It was August 6, 2004 at around 8:00pm when the rebels attacked the camp here in Abok. I was abducted that night and given loot to carry. I walked with them for long distances. The rebels beat me badly as part of training to become a soldier and the severe beating has affected my chest to date. I experience a lot of chest problems. I was forced to have sex with a dead body after one week of my abduction and being with the rebels. This was the body of an abducted girl who was killed along the way as we walked. They forced me to have sex with the dead body of the girl and they were beating me in order to force me to do it. I had to do it because I was forced and had to no way to refuse. When I returned from captivity with the rebels, I found t hat my uncle was killed on that day of the [Abok] attack. Our household property was all looted and destroyed in the attack. We have never been able to recover what we lost.\" - Male adult interviewee from Abok (HH ID 199) As detailed in the quote above, 1 3 percent of all female respondents and 11 percent of all males reported having a member of the LRA deprive them of their liberty and force them to engage in one or more acts of a sexual nature. There was no distinction by gender either for abduction or e xperience of being forced to engage in one or more acts of a sexual nature. These individuals experienced an average of 13 alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity (compared against those who did not report this crime, significant at p<0.01). Four p ercent of females reported having given birth to a child born from sexual relations with a member of the LRA. Despite the small sample size, women who reported this crime are among those who experienced the most aggregate number of alleged war crimes and c rimes against humanity (15 on average). This is significantly higher than other female respondents in the Victimization Assessment Survey who did not experience this specific crime (significant at p<0.01). Further, compared with the average person during t he war in the Acholi and Lango sub- regions, these women experienced 44 times more alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity . The story of a young woman who was married the day before the LRA attacked Odek, makes clear the multiple crimes and harms sh e and her sister experienced when the LRA attacked her family, abducted the girls and forced them to be `wives'. \"On that day, the rebels shot my father as he was eating inside his hut in the camp. For me, [my in - laws] had just paid my bride -wealth and I w as waiting to go to my husband's home in a few days... but all the bride wealth he paid was taken by the rebels during the raid, including livestock \u2014three cattle and six goats\u2014 700,000 shillings and cloth material for my mother and my father were all taken. A ll the things brought for my bride -wealth were taken in the attack. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 31 fic.tufts.edu The rebels abducted two of us, me and my sister. They pierced me with a bayonet on my face (shows visible scar) because I couldn't carry the loot well. I stayed with them for three month s and then managed to escape. During our abduction that day, we found where they had killed thirty people. They ordered us to put them [the dead bodies] in a pile together. We were six girls who were abducted together during the attack. After a while in captivity, they gave us out to men as wives. But the man I was given to was already sick and he infected me with HIV/AIDS, which makes my life hard today. My sister was abducted together with me (my follower) and spent seven years inside the LRA. She returned with a child. My uncle was also killed that day. He had come for my marriage ceremony the day before and had not yet left our home, the attack found him here. My brother's son was also abducted and he has never come back to date, although people say he is still alive inside the LRA, but we can't confirm.\" - Female adult interviewee from Odek (HH ID 140) As the stories of the victim participants make clear that the alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity did not only affect the respondents. Nin ety-one percent of respondents in the Victimization Assessment Survey came from a household where a household member, other than the respondent, experienced a war crime or crime against humanity . On average, including alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity experienced by the respondent, each household in the population experienced 22 alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity as a result of the LRA attacks against IDP camps in Abok, Lukodi and Odek (Table 5 above). Male and female respondents co me from equally affected households. This finding is rather shocking when compared to the findings from the SLRC, Uganda survey, which finds that the average household in Acholi and Lango experienced 2.3 alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity over the course of the 20+ year war. This quote from a victim participant shows how multiple members of the household were targeted during the LRA attacks. \"On the day of the attack at Abok, I had just returned back from hospital because of an earlier LRA attack that had left me wounded. My brother and I had gone to the village [from the camp in Abok] to dig and that is when we were attacked by the rebels. My brother was killed while I was hacked on the head with a machete. On the day of the attack at Odek, my wife and children were set ablaze in the hut, but they managed to escape away. The rebels also looted all our property while destroying some of the things they could not take with them.\" - Male adult interviewee from Abok (HH ID 185) The data encompassing the respondent and their household shows that of the individuals aged 13 or older at the time of our survey, 91 percent experienced at least one war crime or crime against humanity . In addition to the experiences of the victim participants and their households during the LRA attacks on the three IDP camps , we also collected information on the abduction and murder of family members over the course of the entire war by parties to the conflict. Sixty -four percent of respondents reported that they had a family member abducted during the duration of the conflict and 82 percent reported they had a family member killed. Respondents had an average of almost two family members abducted that have never returned (presumed dead) during the conflict (Table 7). Ther e is no distinction by gender of the respondent.

Impact of Alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity on Victim Participant Study Population Compared to General Population In this section, we review the association of the experience of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the attacks against IDP camps in Abok, Lukodi and Odek by the respondent and their household members on certain individual and h ousehold level characteristics. For all outcome indicators, except the psychosocial effect (because we only have data from the affected client population), we compare the Victimization Assessment Survey (VS) population with the SLRC, Uganda population data (that is representative of the entire populations of Acholi and Lango sub -regions) on respondents and their households who have not experienced any alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity (except theft or destruction of property). This comparison a llows us to better understand the potential impact of the experience of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the LRA attacks against the IDP camps in Abok, Lukodi and Odek on respondent and household wellbeing and overall recover y. B1. Psychosocial Effect To understand how alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity might impact the psychosocial wellbeing of the respondent we use the African Youth Psychosocial Assessment (AYPA) tool (refer Annex B for the full tool). The AYPA was only carried out on the victim participants and therefore all findings presented in this section refer only to that population. As described in the methods section, the higher the score the worse the psychosocial wellbeing of the participant is. Comp ared to men, women had a significantly higher overall AYPA score and scored significantly higher on two of the four subscales: depression and anxiety and somatic complaints without medical causes, indicating worse psychosocial wellbeing (Table 8) (for addi tional summary statistics on AYPA and its subscales refer to Annex A Table 1 8). Previous use of the AYPA in northern Uganda produced similar results with females demonstrating significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety -like symptoms compared to ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 33 fic.tufts.edu males in the sample. 11F12 Outside of Uganda, research on war -affected females in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 12F13 Sierra Leone, 13F14 and Nepal 14F15 provide evidence that females tend to experience increased levels of distress, usually within the realm of depression or post- traumatic stress disorder, compared to their male counterparts. Men, on the other hand, reported more pro -social behavior (mean= 13 for males), such as \"I listen to others\", \"I share with others\", \"I share food and eat with others\", and \"I respect others\". These findings are interesting as research in Sierra Leone, for example, has shown that men who have been abducted into armed conflict tend to exhibit more poor conduct and negative behaviors compared to females or other non - abducted males. One male victim from Abok, who experienced severe beatings and was forced to perform sexual acts on a female corpse, described his anti- social behavior: \"I don't stay here much in Abok anymore due to fear. I feel I can't fit in the community anymore. I am very physical with people and violent. I tend to fight a lot. Even over small matters, I get very emotional. Even if someone only says a mi nor thing, I want to fight over it. I am called names like 'Apoa' [meaning mad person]. I am rough with my friends. All this has affected even my studies. I can't even concentrate when I am at school. And the bad names I am given in the community gives m e a wrong image in the eye of others. I have dreams, thoughts, I worry a lot because of my experience.\" - Male adult interviewee from Abok (HH ID 199) In addition, 67 percent of respondents said that they had been harmed by spirits of the dead in relation t o the LRA attacks. Research in sub -Saharan Africa has documented the prominent role of spirits in explaining and understanding mental illness 15F16. Ethnographic inquiry in Acholiland provides rich insight into local cultural practices 16F17. Firstly, there is a dis tinction made between disease or illness with a natural cause (e.g. malaria) and those with a supernatural cause that are deemed 'spirit -related' (e.g. mental illness or illness that does not respond to treatment). While spirit -related diseases have their roots in tradition and can be connected to one's ancestors, they have also emerged in the aftermath of war. Cen represent the vengeful spirits of those who have died a violent death, and are commonly used to interpret what western medicine would call 'ment al illnesses . These spirits reveal one's experience with death, either as a killer or witness, and if not 12 McMullen, J., O'Callaghan, P. S., Richards, J. A., Eakin, J. G., & Rafferty, H.

A woman whose father was murdered during the LRA attack on Odek and who herself was abducted talks about the torment her husband (who was also abducted by the LRA) continues to have and how it affects their lives. \"He stayed with the rebels for four years and was wounded on his left thigh. Because of that, when he is sleeping he normally gets bad dreams at night. He shouts, runs off, hitting himself on the wall at night. He starts hitting the roof of the hut with the hoe. After he gained consciousness, he came back to sleep. The next morning because of the attack on him, I felt so sick and weak. I couldn't work the next morning. My head was heavy. Another night, while dreaming, he g ot up and started pulling. When I asked him what he was doing or dreaming, he said he dreamt one of his friends from captivity was hot and was about to fall in a pit. So he was trying to pull him away so he did not fall in the pit. That was his best friend while in captivity, but he was killed. I asked him to tell his father about [these experiences] but when he told his father, he instead asked the son to go to Kal Kwaro [Acholi Traditional Institution] to find out what they could do about it to free him o f the bad dreams and attacks. But now my husband keeps saying he is going to die. He cries a lot that he will likely die because of the spirit that keeps attacking him. Unless Acholi Way is done, he might not feel better. I worry he could hurt me one day w hile he is dreaming.\" - Adult female interviewee from Odek (HH ID 124) 18F19 Another female from Odek experienced similar issues with spirits haunting her husband and describes the impact it had on their wellbeing as well as their relationship: \"I live with my husband today, but during his abduction, he was forced to kill some people, including his own father who they forced him to kill before taking him away. But the spirit haunts him all the time, he is not well at all. At times, he talks about how he was for ced to kill the people, talks to himself as one possessed. At times, he even picks sharp objects and wants to hit me or any member of the family. Because of the spirit attack and possession, he is unable to work well. He doesn't go to the garden regularly like others do, especially at the time he is possessed. This affects our relationship. But I just continue with him because of sympathy because he didn't do it out of his will. I feel bad if I leave him, his life will go to ruin, no one would want to liv e with him. Even his own mother can't manage him alone without me. 18 Porter, H. ( 2017) 'After Rape: Violence, Justice and Social Harmony in Uganda'.

Even my own natal family asked me to leave him and return back home but we already have three children together so I can't go back to my family. At times, he is ok, but most of the time, he is unwell, kind of unconscious, but I talk to him. Because of his condition, he is unable to function like a normal person and be a father to my children. The children now stay as though they don't have a father when he is not well. But I talk to them about their father and that he will get better, if treated he will be ok. Most times, he says he is unwell, he feels dizzy and abnormal. Once he is like that, he can't do anything. While walking, he gets blind or h e is unable to see and has to bend down for some time to gain consciousness before continuing. He was also forced to kill his own father and another person. The two spirits both attack him differently. They are very bad spirits and aggressive. While sleepi ng, he says he starts dreaming and acts like the person he was forced to kill. He acts like them at the time of their death. When that happens, he gets unconscious and bites his tongue like the person he killed did. After a while he gets better but after t hat happens, he can spend two weeks sick and unable to do anything. He will be wounded from the biting on his tongue and weak and unable to do anything or support the family. It is hard to be with him if you are not used to him or strong hearted.\" - Adult f emale interviewee from Odek (HH ID 132) Being haunted by spirits also negatively affected women. \"When she [interviewee's sister] returned, she was possessed by the spirit of a person she was forced to kill while in captivity. If they didn't perform Acho li Way, she won't be ok or have children ever. The spirit still haunts her to date. She has bad dreams. At times she beats her child she returned with from captivity badly, and wants to hurt other people badly. Once she is possessed by the spirit she beco mes very physical and harmful. When she [her sister] returned from captivity, she got married. But because of the spirit possession and attacks, the man she married left her and chased her away from her marital home, forcing her to return home here in Odek . Sometimes she leaves all her children once the spirit possesses her. \" - Adult female interviewee from Odek (HH ID 140) When looking at our sample of respondents who reported having been abducted, experienced forced sexual relations, and/or had a child due to sexual relations with a member of the LRA, we see that they score even higher on the AYPA scale (all significant at p<0.01). Individuals who were abducted have a total mean AYPA score of 31, those who experienced deprivation of their liberty and fo rced sexual acts have a total AYPA score of 33, and women who had a child due to sexual relations with a member of the LRA have the highest total ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 36 fic.tufts.edu AYPA score of 41. Remembering that the total AYPA score can range from 0 -96,that the total AYPA score does not include the prosocial subscale, and that higher AYPA scores relate to increased impairment, our data show that forced sexual acts and having a child while in captivity result in increased impairment compared to those respondents without such experiences. 19F20 20F21 Previous research demonstrates that experiencing increasing levels of a variety of traumatic events, like sexual assault or forced birth, is directly linked to increased psychological distress. 21F22 Experiences of such trauma, commonly categorized as severe trauma, results in a \"building block effect\" where the trauma itself is so severe that it results in a weakening of vital protective resources, like social support or personal resilience , shown to be important in the recovery of war - affected populations. 22F23 Sexual violence within the LRA has been well documented with women and girls subjected to rape, forced marriage and forced birth while in captivity. 23F24 In line with our findings, research in northern Uganda has found a direct relationship between experiencin g sexual abuse and symptoms of depression and anxiety in females. 24F25 Further analysis using the AYPA, determined that sexual abuse significantly predicted suicide ideation, or a preoccupation with thoughts about killing oneself, as well. 25F26 When these acts result in childbirth, females experience increased hardship. Namely, many females who leave or escape captivity with children find themselves stigmatized within their community and forced to raise their children as single caregivers. The qualitative data provides further insight: 20 The prosocial subscale includes statements regarding positive psychosocial functioning (e.g. \"I cooperate with others\") wher eas the other subscales focus on elements of mental health symptomology related to depression, anxiety and conduct problems. As all subscales within the AYPA are scored the same, with a higher score on \"x\" subscale denoting increased incidence of \"x\", to i nclude the prosocial subscale into the total AYPA score would not provide an accurate depiction of one's psyshcosocial functioning. 21 Unpacking these findings a bit deeper, the average female AYPA total score is 31 (7 points above the mean male score), so experiencing deprivation of one's liberty or a forced sexual act puts you above the mean for both males and females; a male with this score would be above the 75 th percentile for their experience of psychosocial impairment. Similarly, having a child while in captivity, resulting in an average AYPA score of 41, positions a woman above the 75th percentile of those experiencing impairment within this sample. While our use of the AYPA is not meant to position psychosocial impairment in terms of a clinical thre shold, meaning an identified point at which one is considered clinically impaired, a score of 32 (total AYPA mean is 28) demonstrates that within the past week an individual has exhibited functioning in line with anxiety, depression, somatic issues or cond uct problems somewhat . On the other end, a score that ranges from 64 to 96 means that an individual has exhibited impaired functioning often to all the time (the highest AYPA total score in our sample is 67). 22 McMullen, J. et al.

Within the LRA, while sexual violence was perpetrated against both men and women, women and girls were prime targets as they could be given as wives with the aim of producing children 26F27. The consequences of sexual violence are long -term and include physical health consequences (e.g. genital injury, sexual transmitted disease including HIV/AIDS) 27F28; negative mental health outcomes (e.g. depression, anxiety, low self -esteem) 28F29; negative impact on post- conflict livelihoods with many women turning to sex work to address material deprivation 29F30 and disruptions in familial and community rela tions with many women experiencing post -conflict shame and stigma for having violated cultural norms surrounding moral and sexual behavior 30F31. Newer research is beginning to understand the intergenerational impact of sexual violence by examining experiences and outcomes related to children born out of conflict -related sexual violence 31F32. A report compiled by the International Center for Transitional Justice on the legacy of LRA -perpetrated sexual violence focused on affected women and their children and provide d deep insight into the contextual reality of their lives: In a cultural and social context that discriminates against children born out of wedlock and/or as a result of sexual violence and rejects those associated with rebel groups, the initial crime of sexual violence by members of armed groups leading to motherhood has reverberations that will be felt for generations to come. Without targeted support, mothers and their children born of sexual violence are set on a trajectory of poverty, discrimination, violence and mounting obstacles to having their rights respected. 32F33 27 Amone- P'Olak, K., Lekhutlile, T.

Our qualitative data, however, provide some insight into the stigma children (of sample participants) can face in these situations. Therefore, in order to understand the impact of sexual violence on women we must widen our scope to consider the impact on their children as well.

The relationship between the AYPA score and the experience of a lleged war crimes and crimes against humanity is stronger for women (p<0.01) compared to men (p=0.09). This is reflected in both the significantly higher AYPA for women who e xperience only one war crime or crime against humanity (AYPA=25) versus the AYPA for men who experience only one war crime or crime against humanity (AYPA=11), as well as the higher 34 Testa, M., Hoffman, J.

Figure 4: # of individual alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity and AYPA sco re of the victim participant , by gender Linear regression analysis is a statistical tool to be able to see what the statistical association between multiple variables is and how each of those individual variables contributes to a change in the main outcome variable. In this case, we use linear r egression analysis to see how each individual serious crime contributes to the total AYPA score. The coefficient is what tells us the size of that contribution of the experience of certain war crimes and crimes against humanity on the total AYPA score. Fo r example, respondents who said a member of the LRA deliberately injured their child who was not taking part in combat had, on average, and AYPA score that was 3.7 points higher than an individual who did not report that the LRAC deliberately injured their child who was not taking part in combat. 35F36 This approach allows us to show that certain alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity are more significantly correlated (meaning have a stronger relationship with as indicated by a p- value less than 0.1 ) to a higher AYPA score (Table 9); meaning the experience of specific alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity has a more negative impact on a respondent's psychosocial wellbeing compared to others. These 36 The constant tells us what the model would assume, on average, the AYPA score would be if no war crimes and crimes against humanity were experienced by the respondent.

While this relationship is significant for women and men, our data show experiencing alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity has a more negative effect on women compared to men. In understanding these gender differences it is important to remember that males in our sample have higher scores related to prosocial behaviors compared to women, meaning males exhibit more positive ad aptive functioning than females. Further, women, on average, experienced more alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity compared to men, including being twice as likely to experience sexual violence. As discussed earlier, experiencing serious trauma i s not only directly related to psychological distress, but it negatively impacts one's ability to take advantage of those protective resources (e.g., community support, resilience) that are important for recovery. Therefore, it is important to underscore that for women these experiences are not discrete, they result in long- term negative effects that accumulate over time and impede one's ability to recover. Our data also reveal the relationship that destruction of one's property and losing one's child has on one's total AYPA score. We find that these experiences result in a higher AYPA score, which relates to increased psychosocial impairment. One participant discussed the impact LRA attacks had on their community: \"Due to the war, our life and the entire community has been destroyed so much. Trauma is still there to date in the families who were affected. Like for us, we lost about 40 people from our close family during the attack. They were all were related to us \u2014from the same lineage. So, life is not th e same. There is high level of alcoholism in the community to as a way to help people forget what happened to them. But due to the high level of alcoholism, people are unable to work or function normally. They are not well enough to produce enough and prov ide for their families, thus poverty is on the increase in most households.... For me, I had a lot of dreams. I would dream of my sister's son who I played with together, but he was killed in the attack. Sometimes I would see him in my dream with a panga [machete] coming to kill me so I could go where he is. This is because after his death, I thought about him so much because I felt so lonely and this caused me those dreams.\" - Adult male interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 4) ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 42 fic.tufts.edu Another participant's child was abducted during an LRA attack in Lukodi: \"For my missing son, we think about him a lot. We never heard any news about his whereabouts or fate. But because he has been away for so long without any news of his whereabouts, we wanted to perform a burial ritual for him. But we can't because we don't have the means to perform the ritual. It would require a goat and some other material to prepare for the ritual \u2014food to prepare for people who will come \u2014but we don't have the things that would help us organize the rit ual. So we have not been able to do it.\" - Adult male interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 26) For participant victims, the LRA attacks represent a turning point in their lives, as well as the lives of their family and their entire community. Our data demonstrat e a significant relationship between the LRA attacks on the three IDP camps and impaired psychosocial functioning in both male and female victim participants from those camps. Often, these wounds of war are experienced as internalized issues most closely r elated to depression and anxiety. For many, however, there have also been physical impacts due to LRA atrocities. B2. Physical Effect In our study, we used the definitional parameters found in Uganda's Persons With Disabilities Act ( 2006), which has a narrower definition of disability than the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006), of which Uganda is a signatory. We used Uganda's Persons With Disabilities Act definition of disability in our study to capture a substantial, functional limitation of daily life activities caused by physical, mental, or emotional impairment and environmental barriers that result in limiting a person's participation. The primary difference between the two bodies of law is that the Convention's definition includes stigmatizing attitudes and social conditions that can limit people's daily life activities (which is absent in Uganda's Disabilities Act). We thought we could more accurately measure people's physical, mental and emotional impairment that limite d their participation or functionality (as in the Uganda's Disabilities Act) than we could reliably measure those conditions plus the role of stigma and social conditions in impairing a person's participation in daily activities ( as in the Convention on th e Rights of Persons With Disabilities). Two -thirds of the victim participants reported having a disability (Table 10). For more than half of those individuals (or 38 percent of those affected by the LRA attacks) their disability `affects their ability to work a lot' or they `cannot work at all'. The following story shows the long- term negative effects of the physical violence committed during the LRA attacks on people's ability to carry out their livelihoods. During the attack on Abok, this man alleges he was shot in both legs, dragged before the LRA commander of the attack, severely beaten on his orders and left for dead by the rebels. His wife was severely beaten by the LRA during the same attack. \"Because of my injury on the leg [his legs were shattered by the bullets and lost some of his toes], the doctor advised me not to let any dirt enter the part that was wounded. I have a big scar on that foot that still spills blood and puss sometimes and it pains me a lot. I can only go to the garden while wearing a gumboot and my only source of income is farming. Since I can't afford to buy a gumboot, I often look for those that others are throwing away, and I mend them in order to use while going to the garden to dig. The doctor said if any dirt goes into the wou nd, it will resurface back badly. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 43 fic.tufts.edu For my wife she can't carry any heavy things or a load on her head because of the severe beating that was meted on her [by the rebels during the attack on Abok]. She can't even carry a jerry can of water. She can only lif t with her hands but not onto her head... I experience a lot of pain especially in the rainy season and even when the pain lightens, I feel the pain in the wound. In fact, I can tell when it's going to rain or when the rains are about to fall because of the pain I feel in my legs. There is something about it and rain. It pains a lot as if there is still something inside my leg and yet they removed the bullets after the attack. I can't even walk for long distance. I wonder how I will get back home from this meeting [our interview] because if I walk for long, I feel a lot of pain. Because of the pain, I constantly have to take some painkillers to relieve the pain. I buy painkillers of 3500 shillings for 12 tablets in order to feel better. I also can't stand f or long, meaning I can only dig [farm] for a short time and go back home, limiting my contribution to the household. My wife too can't work for long. But once our children are back at home from school, then we feel better but once they are gone, then we ha ve no one to help us with basic everyday tasks of survival: fetching water, cooking and running small errands.\" - Adult male interviewee from Abok (HH ID 218) During the Lukodi attack, LRA rebels allegedly threw this child against trees, bushes and the ear th in an attempt to kill her. She suffers injuries to this day that negatively affect her in many ways, with long- term implications for her health, livelihood and education. \"As a result of that tossing and throwing me on hard ground many times, I have pe rsistent and severe pain in my waist every time I sleep, sit for long or have to perform work that requires physical strength or bending over for a long period of time. Because of the pain, at times I miss school. Or when it [the pain] starts at school, I return home. Yet I can't afford good health care to treat the persistent pain in my waist.\" - Child female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 30) As with experience of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity , disability affects both the respondent and the household they come from. An individual affected by the LRA attacks has, on average, two people with a disability in the household. The high level of disability is partially reflected in the high dependency ratio: 70 percent of household members amon gst the victim participant population are dependents, which has negative implications for livelihoods and access to resources. While there is no significant difference between female and male respondents when it comes to disability, regarding how it affec ts work and number of disabled members of the household, female respondents had a significantly higher dependency ratio than male respondents (p=0.05). This woman had celebrated her marriage ceremony the day before the LRA attack on Odek, saw her father mu rdered, and the rebels abducted her and her sister during the attack. She talked of the large, thick scar that curves inside her sister's leg (which Atim saw), a visible reminder of her disability. Her sister still has not found a way to care for herself and the child who was born of rape and forced marriage by the LRA. \"During the time my sister was with the rebels (was abducted the day of the attack and spent seven years in rebel captivity returning with a child), she was wounde d on her leg and also had a bullet lodged in her chest. That bullet was removed when she returned home. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 44 fic.tufts.edu She can't stand for long due to the injury [of her leg]. She still experiences a lot of pain if she stands for long. It [her leg] bleeds badly even t hough the bullet was removed. We don't understand what continues to cause the bleeding and constant pain. Once the pain starts, she is unable to do even basic things such as farm the land or cook. Because of my sister's injury and mental condition (spirit attacks), I have to provide for all her needs. That is why we live close to each other so I can support her and her child.\" - Adult female interviewee from Odek (HH ID 140) Table 10: Disability by survey and gender of victim parti cipant (mean with confidence intervals in brackets) Male Female Total VP GP VP GP VP GP have a significant at 5%, * significant at 10% There are significant differences in regards to disability between the victim participants and their households compared to the general population of Acholi and Lango sub -regions. The victim participants are significantly more likely t o report a physical disability. They have more disabled members in their household (Figure 5) . And they have a significantly higher dependency ratio than the general population of Acholi and Lango sub - regions. The data shows a markedly increased physical and mental health burden and its consequences on household of victim participants. To illustrate, c onsider that 16 percent the overall populations of Acholi and Lango sub -regions reported a disabled househo ld member, to a striking 65 percent of the victim participants that reported a disabled household member. 37 The dependency ratio was calculated by deviding the number of dependents (children less than 13, adults ov er 65, and those with disability) by the total household size. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 45 fic.tufts.edu Figure 5: Number of disabled members of the household by survey population Finally, we find that individuals who had experienced depravation of their liberty and forced sexual acts are significantly more likely (p=0.09) to report a disability compared to the rest of the victim participant population. Seventy -eight percent of individuals who had reported experiencing this specific war crime or crime against humanity reported having a disabled household member , compared to the rest of the victim population where 65 percent reported a d isabled household member, and the overall population of Acholi and Lango sub -regions where 16 percent reported a disabled household member . B3. Access to Health Care Given the high level of physical, mental and emotional harm reportedly experienced by the victim participant population, we look at access to and quality of health services for routine and serious health problems. Specifically, we focus on four variables: Distance to a health center (in minutes taken to travel there ) 37F38; Access to health services for routine health problems ; Access to health services for serious health problems; Provision of appropriate services at health center . Irrespective of the measure of health service access or quality used, victim participants fare worse than the general population. Compared to the general population in Acholi and Lango, i t takes victim participant households significantly longer to reach a health clinic. Victim participants were significantly less likely to say they can access a health clinic that has the services they need for routine and serious health problems . And 38 Measure by distance of travel time in minutes allows us to understand how long it takes someone to reach a health center. People who are injured and or sick and have to walk or be carried wi ll obviously take longer than a health person walking, or a wealthier person who can ride a bike, or take a motorcycle or car. Thus, it is better to measure in minutes than kilometer distance or mode of transport. 0% 20% 40% 60%percent of population 0 2 4 6 8 10 # of disabled household members VP GP ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 46 fic.tufts.edu victim participants were significantly less likely to report that the clinic had the necessary services and medication available (Table 11). There was no distinction in access or quality of services by gender of the respondent. Table 11: Access and quality of health services by gender and survey (mean with confidence intervals in brackets) Male Female Total VP GP VP GP VP GP distance (in minutes) to health significant at 5%, * significant at 10% As we have just demonstrated, the victim participant population affected by the attacks on the IDP camps in Abok, Lukodi and Odek has experienced a significantly greater number of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity and is more likely to suffer from a physical disability. Now we see that compared to the general population of Acholi and Lango, their greater difference in access to and poorer quality of services likely slows any possible recovery. Victim participants who reported a greater number o f alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity experienced during the LRA attacks were also significantly less likely to say that the services and medication they needed was available (p<0.01) and that they can access health services for routine problems (p=0.09) compared to the general population of Acholi and Lango. Consequently , not only does the victim participant population affected by the LRA attacks against the three IDP camps have worse health access compared to the general population, but househo lds who suffered the most alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity have the worst access within the victim participant population (Figure 6).

Asset Wealth In part due to over 20 years of armed conflict, northern Uganda is among the poorest and most marginalized areas of Uganda, with the lowest human development indicators. 39 F40 When displaced populations began to return to their home communities in larger numbers in 2007, people in northern Uganda faced the highest probability in the country of dying by the age of 40, the highest rate of children underweight for their age, and among the highest illiteracy rates in the country. 40F41 In the post -conflict period, the Ugandan Bureau of Statistics reports the north has the highest percentage of people living in poverty of all of Uganda (double the rates of the rest of the country). 41F42 Today, h ouseholds in northern Uganda have much lower levels of human capital, less assets, and less access to services and infrastructure than households in the Central and Western regions. 42F43 We should keep this troubling picture in mind as we explore the victim participants' asset wealth, which we find is significantly lower t han the already largely impoverished general population (as we 40 United Nations Development Program (UNDP).

The vast majority of the victim participants reported that the LRA stole their property (89 percent) and destroyed their property during the attacks on the three IDP camps and that destruction was extensive (89 percent). Properties were looted, set on fire and destroyed by the LRA, as recalled in the quotes above and by this victim participant. \"At the time of the attack, we were at Lukodi camp. My uncle was stabbed to death by the rebels when they found him. They looted things like food stuff and our household property. My in -law's son was burnt to death inside the hut the rebels set on fire. All our huts were burnt down with the remaining household property. Our livestock, like our goats, were also burnt and dumped there. As I was running for my life from the rebels, I fell on a rock, badly hurting myself, which still pains me to date.\" - Adult female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 108) The devasta tion to their assets and livelihoods, and the harms they suffered during the attacks continue to affect them today, as these two victim participants explain. \"Our household property was all looted and destroyed in the attack. We have never been able to recover what we lost.\" - Adult male interviewee from Abok (HH ID 199) \"There is no way for people to recover because they lost many things during the war. Some people ended up committing suicide becaus e they could not manage the loss they suffered due to the war and couldn't imagine how they would survive. One of my own uncle's committed suicide after losing his wife and all his property in the Lukodi attack.\" Adult female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 1) To investigate victim participants' household wealth today, we use the assets owned by the household, measured using the Morris Score Index (MSI) 43F44. The MSI is a weighted asset indicator that weights each durable asset owned by the household by the share of households owning that asset. This means that househ olds are considered better off when they own assets not owned by most households in the sample. The MSI includes all productive household and livestock assets included in the survey (see full instrument in Annex B). The index has been shown to be a good pr oxy of household wealth in rural Africa 44F45 and has been used in many other settings. 45F46 44 Morris, S., C. Calogero, J. Hoddinott and L.

This applies to the victim participant population as a whole, as well as for male and female respondents. In addition, in both the Victimization Assessment S urvey and the SLRC Uganda survey populations, female respondents reported less asset wealth compared to male respondents. This reality is in part due to persistent structural and cultural discrimination against women and girls in northern Uganda. The difference between the two populations in the MSI score is clearly visible when comparing individual asset ownership (Figure 7). Figure 7: Individual asset ownership by survey Additionally, we find that the worse the responde nts' psychosocial wellbeing (using the AYPA score), the significantly lower their asset wealth (MSI score) (p<0.01) (Figure 8) .

The line of best fit is an imposed line (using a statistical formula) that shows the trend in the data. Similarly, the more alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity an individual or household experienced, the lower their wealth (p=0.02 and p< 0.01 respectively). Thus, the data shows that for the victim participants the experien ce of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity and their lower psychosocial wellbeing is associated with lower household wealth, lower earning s and lower income pot ential to the present day. Figure 8: The relationship between asset wealth (MSI) and psychosocial wellbeing (AYPA) This young woman experienced abduction, attempted murder, rape and forced marriage (where she was infected with HIV) at the hands of the rebels who attacked Odek. Her story reveals that murder of her father and her abduction and sexual abuse has had a multiplier effect on the harms she suffers and their connection to her poverty. \"Life is so hard today, we have to rent land to farm our crops. We have our family land but there is a struggle over the land. All of us women who are now back home after a failed marriage [her sister's husband rejected her because she was a forced wife in the LRA] have been sent away from the land ... We collect water for the primary school here for some money. That is our main source of income. We can't farm anything. We only work leja -leja [daily labor] in people's garden. There are no animals that were left by our late parents, all were taken by our relatives. We can't even hold memorial prayers for our late parents because our relatives sold all our land. But what can we say or do? We have no means to claim the land back from them or to even try. We just watch from a distance .\" - Adult female interviewee from Odek (HH ID 140) Another fema le victim participant from Odek highlights (as does the one above) the compounding problems women victims' face in recovering from the LRA attacks due to pervasive sex and gender discriminatio n against women in northern Uganda. \"Because of the death of my father [during the attack on Odek], it was hard for me to continue with school. So I dropped out and started cohabiting with my current husband. We were many children to our parents, but I w as among the younger ones. But even my older siblings were not able to support me through school because they had no means to support me. 2 3 4 5 6 7MSI score (asset wealth) 0 20 40 60 80 AYPA score (psychosocial wellbeing) MSI trend line/line of best fit ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V.

This happened because our mother was alone [father was killed in Odek attack] and couldn't stand firm on her own to protect our land as a woman.\" - Adult female interviewee from Odek (HH ID 124) Indeed, t he lasting harm due to the stripping and destruction of their assets during the LRA attacks is apparent in nearly every qualitative interview we conducted for this study. As a young woman from Lukodi told us, \"Life is hard today, getting the things we had before the war is nearly impossible to get, like goats. We just try to survive each day, but there is nothing to keep for the future. No other means of survival.\" - Adult female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 77) Groups that are stigmatized and made more vulnerable due t o the crimes they suffered during the war also find it difficult to maintain their assets. This includes widows, orphans, forced wives and former abductees. A former abductee who was forced by the LRA to carry out crimes during the attack on Lukodi, which is her home community, spoke of her situation now in her community. \"Life is different today compared to the past. There is stigma against those who returned [from LRA captivity]. But when our elders were still there, these things would not happen as the y are now. For example, people look for land that their grandparents had given another family to use and they want to claim it back and send that family away on account that they don't know that family and are not related to them in anyway. Like for us, t hey want to chase us away from the land that one of our great parents gave to my family to use because they think we are not their close relatives. I wonder where we will go if that happens. Life has become so hard today. \" - Adult female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 77) In conclusion, we find that the long -term effects of victim participants' experiences of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the LRA in the attacks against the three IDP camps, even 14 years later, continues to negatively impact their household wealth, earnings and income potential. These negative impacts are greatly increased for women victim participants due to the pervasive sex and gender discrimination they face throughout northern Uganda . B5. Food Secu rity The red uced Coping Strategy Index (rCSI) is a tool for measuring c urrent food access and quantity. In the rCSI the higher a household scores on the index the worse -off the household 's food security 46F47. Five coping strategies and their relative severity have been identified to be internationally applicable and can be seen as proxies for food insecurity 47F48. In our study, the overall score of the insecurity index for each household was calculated by multiplying the number of times in the previous week that each coping st rategy had been used by strategy pre -assigned weight, and summing the products. 47 Maxwell, D. and R.

DOMINIC ONGWEN 53 fic.tufts.edu Compared to the general population in Acholi and Lango, w e find that victim participant households have significantly higher food insecurity . This finding holds even when comp aring male and female households (Table 13). The rCSI is 50 percent higher for the victim participant population compared to the general population in Acholi and Lango. This means that the victim participant population has 50 percent higher food insecurity than the general population of Acholi and Lango. Within the victim participant population there is no difference in the findings by gender. Table 13: Food security by population and gender (means with confidence intervals in brackets) Male Female Total VP GP VP GP VP GP reduced significant at 5%, * significant at 10% This quote from a male victim participant from Lukodi helps make clear the link between the LRA attacks and immediate and prolonged food insecurity, including how the breakdown of families exacerbates household food insecurity today. \"I had no food to eat after the [Lukodi] attack and sometimes I would sleep without food or would only have a meal a day, or two at best. People [here in Lukodi] eat poorly because there is not enough food to eat. Some only eat once a day. The loss of livestock means people are unable to cultivate enough food to sustain their family until the n ext season of crops are ready. The relationships in the households are bad. Many women are left in the households to fend for themselves, as most men are not there. But once the women produces the food crops, then some men want to sell the produce for the ir own use, causing conflict in the household.\" - Adult male interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 4) In addition, t he murder and abduction of children by the LRA in attacks on the three IDP camps directly affects people's food security. This man's son was abdu cted and never returned. His loss resulted in his family not having the necessary labor to produce enough crops to sustain the family and send the remaining children to school. \"Because of his [interviewees' son] abduction by the rebels, we keep thinking a lot. I can't farm enough to feed the family. I have become weaker. Even when I try to send my children to school, I can't because we never produce enough to afford their schooling.\" - Adult male interviewee in Lukodi (HH ID 26) The same long lasting impact on food security and education of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the LRA holds true for the murder and abduction of adults. This woman from Odek explains her situation in the aftermath of the LRA attack. \"Because there was no men to help us [after the murder of my father in the Odek attack], we couldn't produce enough food for the family. We always had food shortages at home. My mother ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 54 fic.tufts.edu alone couldn't produce enough on her own to feed the entire family. There was nothing ext ra to sell to send us to school.\" - Adult female interviewee from Odek (HH ID 124) When we compared the distribution of food insecurity between the victim participant population and the general population of Acholi and Lango, we see two peaks within the victim participant population, as shown below (Figure 9). Figure 9: Food insecurity distribution by survey In order to determine what could be associated with those two peaks we ran an simple linear regre ssion on rCSI including experience of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity by the household, disability in the household, wealth, the respondents AYPA score, and controlling for age and sex of the respondent (Table 19 in Annex A). The simple linear regression allows us to see how each of these characteristics might contribute to a household's food insecurity. Of all the household characteristics , the number of disabled individuals has the greatest relationship with increasing household food insecurity , meaning e ach disabled member of the household increase d food insecurity by more than 10 percent from the average score (each disabled person increased the rCSI by 2 points and the average rCSI is 17 points, so 2/17=0.12 or 12% or 'by more than 10 percent') . This finding clearly shows a strong connection between poor physical and mental wellbeing and households' food insecurity within the victim participants ' households. In this report, we have already demonstrated the strong relationsh ip between households experiencing alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the LRA attacks on the three IDP camps and their significantly poorer physical and mental outcomes. Now we see this relationship of their experiences of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity and poor physical and mental health extends to them having worse food security today. Finally, we again find the increased vulnerability of victim participants who were abducted and sexually abused .

Access to School In order t o assess how having experienced the LRA attacks against the IDP camps in Abok, Lukodi and Odek affects the victim participants' education we look at several variables: o Time traveled to reach school (in minutes traveled ) o Girls frequently attending school (r eported by respondent) o Boys frequently attending school (reported by respondent) o Current enrollment in school (from the household roster) Households affected by the LRA attacks on the three IDP camps report it takes significantly longer time to reach a school as compared to the average household in Acholi and Lango (Table 14). As a woman from Lukodi relayed to us, \"My children also don't g o to school. The school is very far and also requires us to pay. But I can't afford the current cost of schooling.\" - Adult female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 108) General enrollment figures for boys and girls (age 5 -29) are the same for both the gen eral population of Acholi and Lango and those living in victim participant households affected by LRA attacks on the three IDP camps. However, regular attendance in school is significantly different for both boys and girls . Both boys and girls living in vi ctim participant households are significantly less likely to be attending school every day , as compared to their same -sex peers in the general population (Table 14). Table 14: Access to and attendance of schools (means with confide nce intervals in brackets) VP GP Distance (in minutes of travel time ) to school 58.606*** 50.826 [0.670,0.722] *** significant at 1%, ** significant at 5%, * significant at 10% Furthermore, a closer look at the enrollment data shows that the similarity in enrollment is due to a different distribution in age between the general population and the victim participant population (Figure 10). Within ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 56 fic.tufts.edu each age group (ages 5 -10, 11 -15, 1 6-20, 21 -30), children living in victim participant households have significantly lower levels of enrollment (p value=0.01, 0.04, 0.02, 0.02 respectively). In other words, for each age group listed above, those children are significantly more likely to not be enrolled in school in the victim participants ' households, as compared to the general population of Acholi and Lango. We sought to understand why this was. A woman from Lukodi spoke with us about why her children are not in school. \"The most painful t hing for us parents is the challenge of educating our children. It is very expensive today to send children to school. Even primary education is expensive. We have to pay from 20,000 UGS and above per child. And if one has more children, it is impossible to pay for all of them or even negotiate with the school to give you some time to raise the money while the children go to school. Some schools demand food contributions for lunch: 11 kilograms of maize, 7 kilograms of beans and 2000 shillings as a contribution for cooking oil per child. This is hard for us parents to afford every term. So, we have to provide for both the family and children at school with the little food we harvest. This is really difficult for us parents to do and is causing poverty in the households, as most of the food produced are taken to school and nothing is left for home use.\" - Adult female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 110) It is very important to realize that we found that despite no personal experience in the LRA attacks on th e three IDP camps and almost a decade of time passing, children who are today between the ages of 5 and 10 living in victim participant households are worse off in terms of attendance and enrollment in school than their same -sex peers in the general popula tion of Acholi and Lango. Here we clearly see evidence of the intergenerational harm of the LRA attacks against the victim participant population in the three IDP camps. Figure 10: School enrollment by sample, age, and 0% years >20 yearsmale female male female male female male female x axis: by gender and age of child (2018)VP GP ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 57 fic.tufts.edu Furthermore, boys and girls who had either been sexually assaulted or abducted faired significantly worse (p<0.01) in regards to school attendance and enrollment (Figure 11) . In the victim participant population, only 18 percent of children who had been s exually assaulted reported being enrolled in school. Only 29 percent of those who had been abducted have a child enrolled in school. W hen it comes to attendance, 0 percent of girls and 9 percent of boys who had been sexually assaulted attend school every day. Only 33 percent of girls and 37 percent of boys who were abducted attend school every day. Again, we see quite plainly the intergenerational harm suffered by the children who had been sexual assaulted or abducted. Figure 11: Enrollment in school by experience of serious crime (victim participant population only) We conclude that the combination of the high numbers of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the LRA against the victim participant populat ion and the resulting physical , emotional and mental injury and disability, poorer mental wellbeing, destruction of their assets and reduced ability to carry out livelihoods has resulted in these households being unable to afford to enroll and keep their child attending school. The stories of victim participants in our qua litative interviews strengthen our confidence in this conclusion. \"My brother [killed in Abok attack] left or phans. There are five children but there is no way I can care for them. I ha ve no ability to provide their schooling and provide for all their other basic needs together with that of my own children.\" - Adult male interviewee from Abok (HH ID 40% 60% 80%% of population (<30 years) enrolled in school abducted had child born in bush sexual assaultmale female male female male female did not experience this war crime/crime against humanity experienced this war crime/crime against humanity ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V.

By now he would be 28 years old. My parents ask about his fate but have no way of knowing what happened to him, is he alive or dead.\" - Adult male interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 85) A wom an from Lukodi explained, \"Life is hard. People don't have ways to make a living. There are no livestock. Paying school fees is hard. And we now have to divide all the food crops we grow between meeting our own food needs and what we can sell to try and get school fees. As a result, we are always lacking food because we never able to produce enough, because we don't have livestock to open much land (and fast) for cultivation.\" - Adult female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 108) The lack of continuing education for the children of victim participants can lead to even more harmful situations, such as child marriage for both girls and boys. As this young man explained to us, \"I dropped out of school during that time [in the aftermath of the Lukodi attack] bec ause of the insecurity but also because my family could not meet my school fees. We were impoverished... As a young person in the family, I had to work to help provide for the family. So, I would miss school often... Many children in this community are out of school. Even me, I could have continued with my education [I had good grades] but dropped out due to lack of fees. Most parents are unable to provide or send their children to school, even affording primary level of education, they can't. Because I dropped out of school, I had to marry early [a girl child]. I had no any other way to continue and live alone, yet I was already out of school.\" - Adult male interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 4) B7. Access to potable water Access to clean water is one component of preventing child morbidity and poor nutritional outcomes such as stunting, which is associated with negative long- term cognitive and physical development outcomes 48F49. In addition, water is a key component of everyday household activities and an important natural resource to support agricultural activities. Thus, in this section we look at two components of water access: Time travelled (in minutes) to go to, take from, and return from a water source Type of water source Comparing the victim participant population and the general population of Acholi and Lango, we find no significant difference in the time household travels to access any source of water. However, we find that the victim participant population has significantly less access to potable water as compared to the general population of Acholi and Lango (Table 15 ). 49 Wright, J., S. Gundry and R. Conroy (2004). \"Household drinking water in developing countries: a systematic review of microbiological contamination between source and point of use.\" Tropical Medicine and International Health 90(1): 106 -117.

We conclude that the pro gnosis for the future health status and physical and cognitive development of the children of the victim participant population is poor due to the high levels of stunting, their significantly lower levels of food security, lower levels of and access to edu cation, less access to health services and potable water among th e victim participant population. Again, we find strong evidence of the adverse, damaging intergenerational effects of the LRA attacks on the victim participant population's children. B8.

American Economic Review 84, 369 -395 ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 60 fic.tufts.edu We took a comprehensive approach to capturing livelihood and social prote ction services in both surveys. For livelihood services we asked about if in the last year anyone in their household had received seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, tools, agricultural extension services, access to seed money for a revolving fund, non - agricultural services, and any other livelihood services given by any group (communi ty based, local, government, or NGO). For social protection services we asked if in the last year anyone in their household had received free food aid or household items, been part of school feeding programs, received feeding in hospitals, received retirement pension or other social protection service given by any group (community based, local, g overnment, or NGO) . It is important to note that in the general population of Acholi and Lango sub -regions, the vast majority of households do not report receiving any livelihoods and social protection services , and when they do receive those services, mo st say they did not make any difference in their households. 60F61 Furthermore, compared to other war -affected populations in other countries, northern Uganda scores very low on populations' reporting that they receive livelihood and social protection services. 61F62 With this in mind, we found that in the last year, victim participant households reported significantly greater access to most of the livelihood and social protection services compared to the general population (Table 16 ), including: free food aid or household items, school feeding programs, feeding in hospitals, retirement pension, other social protection, seeds, fertilizer, pesticides, tools, agricultural extension services, access to seed money for a revolving fund, non-agricultural services, and other livelihood services. Regarding livelihood services last year (in 2017) , 57 percent of the victim participant population 62F63 received some kind of livelihood service, compared to 19 percent of the general population in Acholi and Lango. On average , victim participant households received one form of livelihood service compared to an average of 0.24 livelihood services for the general population in Acholi and Lango . For example, 23 percent of households in the victim participant population received se eds, fertilizer, tools, and pesticides, compared to 5 percent of the general population in Acholi and Lango . When it comes to agricultural services, 37 percent of the victim participant population reported receiving one or more of these services, compared to only 6 percent of the general population in Acholi and Lango . For social protection services, 30 percent of the victim participant population reported receiving social protection services compared to 14 percent of the general Acholi and Lango populatio n. On average, victim participant households received 0.37 forms of social protection service, compared to an average of 0.16 social protection services in the genera l population. For example, 8 percent of the victim participant population reported receivi ng school fe eding, compared to less than 1 percent of the general population in Acholi and Lango . When it comes to food aid, 9 percent of the victim participant population received food aid or free household goods, compared to 6 percent the general populat ion in Acholi and Lango. 61 Mazurana, Dyan, Rachel Gordon and Teddy Atim . 2014.

In Lukodi 53 percent of respondents received livelihood servi ces; in Odek 65 percent of respondents received se rvices; and, in Abok 58 percent of respondents received services. When it came to social protection, 30 percent of respondents in Lukodi reported receiving services, 32 percnet in Abok, and 22 percent in Odek. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 61 fic.tufts.edu Earlier studies on the impact of the war on people in northern Uganda highlight that addressing the effects of the war may require on -going, and in some cases life -time, support. 63F64 The fact that most households that are receiving s upport services report only one or less services a year is concerning, and indicates the response is falling well short of meeting the needs that this report has found . Those who are war wounded (physically, mentally and emotionally) are a clear case of t hose who may require long -term therapeutic care. This man's brother and father were killed during the attack on Odek. He was abducted by the LRA and later severely injured, requiring the amputation of his leg. \"World Vision supported me with artificial limb for my amputated leg on return, but after they closed their program, I was supposed to pay on my own. Replacement limbs cost about 1.5 million shillings, impossible for a farmer like me to afford. Then later, the ICC's Trust Fund for Victims' started providing access through AVSI rehabilitation center based in Gulu. So, each time I have the artificial limb problem, I go back to AVSI in Gulu. But they only provide the limb and pay for my own transport and upkeep while there.\" - Adult male interviewee f rom Odek (HH ID 126) While the figures for receiving livelihoods and social protection services are significantly better for the victim participant population than those of the general population, many within the victim participant population still do not report receiving such services. Furthermore, there appears to be little transparency or clarity of why some receive services and others do not. This interviewee was a child at the time of the attack on Lukodi. His home was burnt, their property looted an d destroyed, his cousin who lived with him was shot and killed, and his older brother was abducted and was reported dead. Due to the attack, his family fled to another IDP camp, where destitute, he was forced out of school and experienced severe food inse curity. When asked about any form of assistance he replied, \"I have never got any assistance so far for survivors, but I hear others get some help. Even programs such as the youth livelihoods programs, we tried to form a group with the hope that we could get some assistance. But we didn't get. It was made worse because the first group to get the assistance here were unable to pay back, so no other group was awarded after they defaulted on their repayment. I think we are unable to get assistance because we don't have the right connection or know people who can connect us to those programs. If we knew someone, maybe we would also get something.\" Adult male in terviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 4) Importantly, f or the victim participant population we find no connect ion between the experience of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity and/or disability and receiving either social protection or livelihood services (Table 20 and 2 1 in Annex A), or the number of different services they receive (Table 2 2 and 2 3 in Annex A). Furthermore, despite significantly worse outcomes (as detailed throughout this report), respondents in the victim participant population who reported being abducted or being deprived of their liberty and forced to engage in one or more acts o f a sexual nature were no more or less likely to receive either social protection or livelihood services. In other words, if targeting based on need is being applied by those giving assistance in Abok, Lukodi and Odek, the assistance does not appear to ac tually capture the 64 Mazurana, Dyan, Anastasia Marshak, Teddy Ati m, Rachel Gordon and Bretton McEvoy, 2016, \"Disability and Recovery from War in Northern Uganda,\" Third World Thematic : A Third World Quarterly Journal, December, available at http://dx.doi.or g/10.1080/23802014.2016.1235469http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23802014.2016.1235469 ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V.

Experience of Crimes In this section we look at the experience of ordinary crimes (not war crimes or crimes against humanity) on the househo ld level, comparing across the victim and general population. We look both at the total number of crimes reported by the respondent that their household experienced in the past three years, as well as individual crimes. Households in the victim population reported experiencing significantly more crimes (almost three times as many) than households in the general population (Table 17). When looking at individual crimes, the victim population were significantly more likely to report experiencing verbal threat s, theft, house breaking, theft of livestock, serious or physical harm to a child, land grabbing, sexual assault, physical assault, and witchcraft (Figure 12). In addition, the more war crimes or crimes against humanity a household experienced, the signifi cantly more crimes they reported in the past three years (p<0.01).

Perceptions of Justice We carried out 16 in-depth, semi -structured interviews on perceptions of justice with a purposive sample of the victim participant population (as detailed above in the Methods section) . At the time of our interviews, no victim participants felt that they had received justice for the alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity they alleged were committed against them and their households dur ing the LRA attacks on the three IDP camps. They repeatedl y said, \"There has been no justice for what happened to us.\" The vast majority spoke expectantly about the case Prosecutor VS Dominic Ongwen currently before the ICC . They felt the Ongwen case be fore the ICC was important and that it serves as a form of recognition that what occurred to them was wrong, as these three respondents show. 0% VS SLRC ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 65 fic.tufts.edu \"The case is good \u2014we can know that they didn't forget about what happened to us here, but that it is being follow ed up. So the people who suffered know they are being thought of, and that people also remember those who are responsible.\" - Adult male interviewee from Odek (HH ID 126) \"I think it's [Ongwen's case] important for survivors because it tells the people th at doing bad is not accepted, and we also get to rest from having to flee all the time due to conflict.\" - Adult male interviewee from Abok (HH ID 185) \"It's important, the ongoing court case for survivors. Once it is done properly and delivers justice as we expect it will, we will be consoled and feel happy.\" - Adult female interviewee from Odek (HH ID 124) The majority of the victim participants we interviewed felt that person(s) found guilty of orchestrating or committing crimes against them should be pu nished, and that the punishment itself would serve as a form of justice to them. 64F65 They also believed that punishment of the guilty party would deter similar criminal behavior in the future. \"I believe it [the ICC] can deliver justice because he [Ongwen] should account for what he did. Whoever does anything wrong should be held responsible for their actions. Otherwise, they can continue to do it if not penalized. I think the court proceedings can provide justice for survivors; I will feel satisfied if he is found guilty and punished for his action. Also, because we know he was punished for it, it acts as a deterrent for others from committing similar crimes and we can live with more certainty.\" - Adult male interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 26) \"It is impor tant that victims receive justice as it helps to console them and helps to show that bad things cannot be tolerated.... And once the case is ruled, he should be penalized if found guilty so he knows that what he did was bad.\" - Adult female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 77) \"I think the court process [Ongwen's case b efore the ICC] will help ensure such crimes are deterred and not committed again in the future. But if the trial wasn't done, it would promote impunity. But now people know and act with reservat ion and care because they know there are penalties for their actions.\" - Adult male interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 4) Some victim participants expressed concerns that justice would not be met if those they alleged were responsible for the terrible harms they suffered were not held accountable. This woman's husband was forced to kill his own father and other civilians as part of his abduction by the LRA. To this day he continues to suffer mental, emotional and spiritual harm because of those actions. She s tated, \"I think the court process is important because if my husband hears that the person who forced him to commit such atrocities is being tried and is held responsible, probably he will get some satisfaction. But also his own children could benefit fro m any assistance to come since he is now unable to provide for them because of the violation he suffered. If the court concludes that he is not guilty, we will feel very unhappy as survivors.\" - Adult female interviewee from Odek (HH ID 132) 65 We did not ask questions directly related to Dominic Ongwen but kept the questions broader to `the LRA' and `alleged perpetrators'. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 66 fic.tufts.edu Another woma n whose uncle was stabbed to death, her son -in-law burnt to death, and their properties looted and burned during the LRA attack on Lukodi said, \"I think the court should be open to hearing our case and offer a good judgment of the case. Because we experienced terrible things and those responsible should be found guilty. If not, then who will be held responsible for what happened here? That will make us very sad.\" - Adult female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 108) As part of their experience of receiving j ustice for the harms that were inflicted upon them during the LRA attacks on the three IDP camps, victim participants expect that if the defendant Dominic Ongwen is found guilty that the ICC will award direct reparation to them. For nearly all the victim participants we interviewed their expectations of justice are tied to receiving reparations to address what has happened to them. If a guilty verdict comes without reparation, their experience of justice will be incomplete. The victim participants spoke of several forms of reparation. First, as noted in their quotes above, they spoke of receiving satisfaction in the recognition through the case Prosecutor V. Dominic Ongwen that what happened to them was wrong. They spoke of receiving satisfaction as a r esult of the verification and disclosure of the facts regarding the LRA attacks against the IDP camps of Abok, Lukodi and Odek. And they felt they would receive satisfaction if the accused Dominic Ongwen were found guilty of the crimes the Prosecutor alleges he committed and sanctioned accordingly. Some also felt they would receive satisfaction if accused Dominic Ongwen personally takes responsibility for the crimes he committed and acknowledges that what he d id was wrong. \"If the court process can go on well, and the person [Ongwen] responsible accepts responsibility for what happened, that he acknowledges that he committed the offences that would be justice to us as survivors. It is important that he acknow ledges and accepts responsibility for the harms he caused to the community. As long as he accepts responsibility for his action, we can forgive him...we can find relief and feel better. We victims expect reparation for what we lost because of his [Ongwen] actions. We pray it all ends well; that he [Ongwen] accepts responsibility and survivors are repaired for harms we have suffered.\" - Adult female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 1) Second, if the ICC judges find the accused guilty of the charges brought by the Prosecutor, the victim participants stressed their desire for rehabilitative forms of reparation, particularly therapeutic health care assistance for those physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually harmed. Many stressed the need for no cost, on-going care that works towards healing people, not simply pain management as many people currently experience. Their access to this care should cover their transport, or where possible be provided by nearby or mobile clinics, as long transport for the di sabled is particularly difficult. \"Those who are wounded [need] access [to health care centers] for routine follow up and care for injuries sustained in the war.\" - Adult male interviewee from Abok (HH ID 218) \"[People abducted by the LRA] have different k inds of injuries. Some have bullets still lodged in their bodies. Send information to those responsible to provide for us assistance to treat these injuries. I also have a bullet still lodged in my arm which causes constant pain.\" - Adult female interview ee from Odek (HH ID 132) ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 67 fic.tufts.edu \"Most important for us is health care. We have a health center but it is cost shared. If assistance could improve the existing health center and so that people don't have to pay so much to access health care that would be better. I prefer this form of assistance because I think individual assistance might not be possible because there are many survivors.\" - Adult male interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 4) Third, as t he findings from this study clearly show, the physical, mental, emotio nal and spiritual injury and disability caused by the LRA attacks is having a profoundly negative impact on people's lives and livelihoods. We conclude that it is also leading to negative and harmful intergenerational affects among the children of the victim participant population (as detailed in this report's sections on health, food security, water and education). The victim participants make these connections in their discussion of rehabilitative forms of reparation. \"Those of us with injuries should al so be provided with assistance to access better health care so that we can be in good health to work better to provide for our households.\" Adult female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 108) Fourth, most people also spoke of the need for reparation in the f orms of restitution and compensation as a result of the extensive looting and destruction of their properties and the long- term damage done to their livelihoods (through the looting, damage and destruction of their human and material assets). Given that the victim participants' primary livelihoods are in agriculture and livestock, many spoke of the need for assets (or cash to purchase assets) to assist them in regaining and boosting their production. These assets included oxen and other livestock, plows a nd land for those who have been stripped of their access to land. Interviewees were aware that for those victim participants that are disabled and now unable to work, such forms of material reparation would not be appropriate and instead monetary compensat ion is needed. Importantly, surplus production (what many of the victim participants say they lack) is what most people rely on to afford their supplemental foodstuffs, children's education, medicine and medical treatment, housing, and purchasing of livelihood assets. Notably, surplus production is also essential to cover costs for events that form essential parts of their identity, dignity and wellbeing as humans, including formal traditional marriage (with bride wealth) and the proper burial of their dead . Assets that would help boost surplus production are needed to help ensure people can live and live with dignity. Others spoke of compensation as a means to start different livelihoods, such as small businesses. \"They should help care for the survivors and our families. Once the [Ongwen] case is over, assistance could be provided to survivors - such as opportunity to create our own business, and livestock that we can raise and keep to help our families.\" - Adult male interviewee from Abok (HH ID 185) As these two orphaned sisters who were both captured and sexually abused by the LRA as a result of the LRA attack on Odek, and then rejected and forced off their lands by relatives explain, \"Receiving support is important because it shows they care about us. Some like us have nowhere to go. We lost both of our parents due to the war. If there is justice, maybe we can get our own land and find new ways to survive through the court process. We could find room to breathe a little because we will feel like someone cares about us, directing us and giving us ways to move forward.\" - Adult female interviewee from Odek (HH ID 140) Fifth, many victim participants spoke of the need to provide education to the young people who suffered due to the LRA attacks and the youn ger children in their households who continue to suffer as a result. As we ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 68 fic.tufts.edu showed above, these children lack an ability to regularly attend school, and in some cases even enroll in school. \"There is a real need to assist the people with education. There a re very many orphans in this community and there is no assistance to help them go to school. If they are given assistance, even just for vocational skills training, that would make such a huge impact and improve their lives. Like now they have almost no op tions and most girls get married after dropping out of school and the boys are becoming alcoholics.\" - Adult male interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 4) \"I was abducted and lost time in captivity, I would not have stopped with my education in P.7. With the [Ong wen] case, I am sure once it's concluded, they should offer assistance \u2014even if not individual then community level \u2014like build and staff a school that can support people here to go to school.\" - Adult male interviewee from Odek (HH ID 126) \"I also expect t hem to help us send the children to school because we have no way to provide for their schooling [into secondary], since we are not educated... Once the case is over, we survivors should be provided support to improve our lives. We need support to send chi ldren to school...For orphans, what can be done for them? We can't afford their schooling yet government arrests parents for failure to send children to school. What can be done to ensure they attend school?\" - Adult female interviewee from Lukodi (HH ID 108 ) In conclusion, t he qualitative interviews with victim participants revealed a strong desire for justice. For many , justice includes recognition of the wrongdoing committed against them, punishment for those found guilty, and direct reparations. With the exception of their hopes in the ongoing ICC trial, victim participants noted that they had received no justice for the alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity that were allegedly committed against them and their households during the LRA attacks on the three IDP camps. However, respondents indicated that if the accused were found guilty in the case Prosecutor VS Dominic Ongwen, it would bring recognition to the suffering caused by the defendant's actions, and show that such actions cannot be commit ted with impunity and thus help to deter future atrocities. Victim participants also stressed the need for reparation in the form of rehabilitation, therapeutic care, livelihood support, financial restitution and compensation, and educational provision fo r their household members. The victim participants' discussion of reparations revealed the complex impact the conflict has had on their lives. For those with physical and mental health needs, access to therapeutic and rehabilitative care is essential. Curr ently, these services are too costly and, at times, unavailable or insufficient to meet the needs of the victims. Further, these injuries, as they continue unaddressed, are negatively affecting the victims and their families. Victim participants also disc ussed the need for access to education for themselves and their children. Formal schooling or vocational training is viewed as necessary for improving one's life and opening up opportunities for advancement. Monet ary and material compensation was also dis cussed as a vital part of reparations. Many of the victim participants experienced livelihood disruptions resulting in loss of land, livestock and homes as well as physical injury leading to an inability to work. Direct compensation is one way that victims feel they can regain some of what they have lost and work towards building assets for long- term stability. Reparations for victims can take many forms, as evidenced by the different types of reparations and justice the victim participants discussed. Give n the range of experiences in conflict as well as the wide variety of ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 69 fic.tufts.edu challenge facing victims, it is imperative that those in charge of providing reparations consider the individual experiences of each victim. A \"one size fits all approach\" may fail to address the unique needs of the victim participants. The rich qualitative information provided by the victim participants represents a blueprint from which to begin the justice process. VI. Conclusion Compared to the general war -affected population of Acholi and Lango sub -regions, the victim participant population from Abok, Lukodi and Odek is significantly worse off in almost every aspect we explored in this study. Experiences of War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity As individuals the victim participant population experienced, on average, 20 times more war crimes and crimes against humanity than the average person living in Acholi and Lango sub- regions who went through the 20+ year war in Acholi and Lango sub -regions. Even their youngest members were not spared. A child aged zero to five during the time of the LRA attacks on the Abok, Lukodi, and Odek IDP camps, on average, has 14 times more experiences of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity than does the average war-affected person in Acholi and Lango sub -regions. Victim participants that were deprived of their liberty and forced by the LRA to engage in one or more acts of a sexual nature experienced among the highest numbers of war crimes and crimes against humanity (13 crimes on average). Notably, both men and women experienced this crime almost equally (11 percent of male respondents and 13 percent of female respondents). Females who reported having given birth to a child born fro m forced sexual relations with a member of the LRA experienced the most aggregate number of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity (15 on average). Notably, compared with the average person during the war in the Acholi and Lango sub -regions, these women experienced 44 times more alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Households were also severely affected. Ninety -one percent of the victim participant population came from a household where a household member, other than the respondent, exper ienced a war crime or crime against humanity. On average, including alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity experienced by the respondent, each household in the population experienced 22 alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity as a result of the LRA attacks against IDP camps in Abok, Lukodi and Odek. Psychosocial Wellbeing We found that the more war crimes and or crimes against humanity a participant experienced, the worse their psychosocial well- being. Compared to men, women had significantly higher levels of depression, anxiety, somatic complaints without medical causes, and lower prosocial skills indicating their poorer psychosocial wellbeing in these areas. Notably, 67 percent of the victim participant population reported that they had been harmed by spirits of the dead in relation to the LRA attacks on Abok, Lukodi and Odek. Research in sub -Saharan Africa has documented the prominent role of spirits in explaining and understanding mental illness 65F66. Furthermore, when looking at victim partic ipants who reported they were abducted, 66 Patel, V. (1995). \"Explanatory models of mental illness in Sub -Saharan Africa. \" Social Science Medicine , 40(9): 1291- 1298. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 70 fic.tufts.edu experienced forced sexual relations, and/or had a child due to forced sexual relations with a member of the LRA, they all have significantly worse psychosocial wellbeing compared to their peers in the victim participant population that did not experiences these crimes. We also found that a person's experience of sexual abuse as a war crime or crime against humanity significantly predicted suicide ideation, or the person's preoccupation with thoughts about killing oneself. 66F67 Finally, of all of the individual alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity, the experience of losing or having your child injured has the greatest contribution to a person's poor psychosocial wellbeing. Physical Wellbeing, Disability and Experi ence of Health Care Compared to the general war -affected population of Acholi and Lango sub -regions (that did not report experiencing a war crime or crime against humanity) , the victim participant population is significantly more likely to have a disabilit y that `affects their ability to work a lot' or they `cannot work at all' (reported by 38 percent of the victim participant population). An individual affected by the LRA attacks against the IDP camps of Abok, Lukodi and Odek has, on average, two people wi th a disability in the household. The high level of disability is partially reflected in the high dependency ratio: 70 percent of household members amongst the population affected by the LRA attacks against the IDP camps of Abok, Lukodi and Odek are depend ents, which has negative implications for livelihoods and access to resources. At the same time, it takes households that experienced the LRA attacks against the IDP camps at Abok, Lukodi and Odek significantly longer than the general population to reach a health clinic. They were also significantly less likely to say they can access a health clinic that has the services they need for routine and serious health problems. And they were significantly less likely to report that the clinic had the necessary se rvices and medication available compared to the general population in Acholi and Lango. We conclude that the population affected by the LRA attacks on the IDP camps in Abok, Lukodi and Odek has experienced a significantly greater number of war crimes and c rimes against humanity, is more likely to suffer from a disability, and at the same time has worse health access and quality compared to the general population. Furthermore, we conclude that households who suffered the most war crimes and crimes against h umanity have the worst access within the victim participant population. Asset Wealth The widespread looting and devastation to their assets and livelihoods, and the harms the victim participants suffered during the LRA attacks continue to affect them today . The victim participant population has significantly less asset wealth compared to the average household in Acholi and Lango sub -regions (who did not experience a war crime or crime against humanity) . We conclude that victim participants who experienced w ar crimes and crimes against humanity have lower psychosocial wellbeing, and are more likely to have lower household wealth and lower earning and income potential to the present day. Food Insecurity Compared to the average population in Acholi and Lango (who did not experience a war crime or crime against humanity) , we find that participant victims' households have significantly higher food insecurity. Of 67 Amone- P'Olak, K., Lekhutile, T. M., Meiser -Stedman, R., & Ovuga, E. (2014). \"Mediators of the relation between war experiences and suicidal ideation among former child soldiers in Northern Uganda: The WAYS study.\" BMC Psychiatry., 14(271): 1- 9. ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 71 fic.tufts.edu all the variables, the number of disabled individuals has the strongest connection with increasing ho usehold food insecurity. We find food insecurity is the highest among households where individuals were sexually assaulted by the LRA. Respondents that reported being deprived of their liberty and forced to engage in one or more acts of a sexual nature ha d a significantly higher food insecurity than the remainder of the population that were affected by the LRA attacks on the three IDP camps. Access to School Both boys and girls living in households affected by the three LRA attacks are significantly less likely to be attending school every day than their same -sex peers in Acholi and Lango sub -regions (who come from households that did not experience a war crime or crime against humanity). In addition, children from the households affected by the three atta cks on the IDP camps are significantly less likely to be enrolled in school at every age group. Thus, we find that even children between the ages of 5 and 10 years (in the year 2018) , who were not alive during the attacks, are still worse off than their sa me sex peers , clearly indicating the intergenerational impact of the attack . We conclude that the combination of the high numbers of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the LRA against the population in the three IDP camps and the resulting physical injury and disability, poorer mental wellbeing, the stripping and destruction of their assets, and their reduced ability to carry out livelihoods has resulted in these households being unable to afford to enroll and keep their child attending school. Thus we project that the outcome for their children's education and development of their human capacity is poor. Access to Potable Water Access to clean water is o ne component of preventing child morbidity and poor nutritional outcomes, such as stunting, which is associated with negative long- term cognitive and physical development outcomes. Water is also key component of everyday household activities and an importa nt natural resource to support agricultural activities. The victim participant population has significantly less access to potable water compared to the general population of Acholi and Lango. Considering the already high prevalence of stunting (32 percent ) in the northern region of Uganda, combined with significantly lower levels of food security, education, access to health services, and potable water among the population affected by the attack on the three IDP camps, we conclude that the present health s tatus and physical and cognitive development of the children of this affected population is poor, and will remain poor into the future without effective interventions. Access to Livelihoods and Social Protection Services This is the only area in which vict im participants did better, in this case received significantly more support services, than the general population of Acholi and Lango (who did not experience a war crime or crime against humanity) . Yet for the majority of these households that are receiv ing support services, they report receiving only one or less service s a year. Importantly, for the victim participant population we find no connection between the experience of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity and/or disability and receiving either social protection or livelihood services. Furthermore, despite significantly worse outcomes in every indicator we looked at, respondents in the victim participant population who reported being abducted or being deprived of their liberty and forced t o engage in one or more acts of a sexual nature were no more or less likely to receive either social protection or livelihood services. In other words, if targeting based on need is being applied by those giving assistance in Abok, Lukodi and Odek, the as sistance does not appear to ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 72 fic.tufts.edu actually capture the populations who as of 2018 are the most vulnerable and worst off. We conclude that the response is falling short of meeting the needs of the victim participant population. Experience of Crimes The victim participants reported that their household experienced almost three times as many crimes in the past three years compared the general population (that did not report experiencing any war crimes or crimes against humanity). Victim participants were significantly more likely to say they have experienced verbal threats, theft, house breaking, theft of livestock, serious or physical harm to a child, land grabbing, sexual assault, physical assault, and witchcraft. The more war crimes or crimes against humanity a household experienced, the significantly more crimes they reported in the past three years. Thus, we conclude that the victim population continues to experience significantly more crimes than the general non- war crime affected population in Lango and Acho li, dismantling any possible gains in resilience. Perceptions of Justice Victim participants have a strong desire for justice. For many, justice includes recognition of the wrongdoing committed against them, punishment for those found guilty, deterrence against future atrocities and direct reparations. The victim participant discussion of reparations revealed the complex impact the conflict has had on the lives of the victim participants. Respondents stressed the need for reparation in the form of rehabil itation, therapeutic care, livelihood support, financial restitution and compensation, and educational provision for their household members. Given the range of experiences in conflict as well as the wide variety of outcomes facing victims, it is imperativ e that those in charge of providing reparations consider the individual experiences of each victim. In other words, a \"one size fits all approach\" may fail to address the unique needs of the victim participants. Potential Impact on Nutrition and related In tergenerational Effects We find a gre ater likelihood that children in victim participant households affected by war crimes and crimes against humanity are malnourished compared to the general population (that did not experience a war crime or crime against humanity). According to the UNICEF conceptual framework of malnutrition (UNICEF, 1991), food insecurity, unhealthy household environment (including access to potable water), and inadequate health services are underlying causes of child malnutrition. Data from our victim population shows that they perform significantly worse than the general population on all three contributing underlying causes. Furthermore, access to education and wealth are all basic causes of child malnutrition. Once again, the victim population per forms significantly worse on these indicators. Child malnutrition has been shown to be associated with extremely negative and pervasive effect on human performance, health, and survival, 67F68 including effects on morbidity 68F69, mortality 69F70, intrauter ine growth 70F71, cognitive and social development 71F72, 68 United Nations Standing Committee on Nutrition (2002).

Thus, we conclude that the significantly worse status of the victim population in relation to the respondent and household captured in this report is likely to lead to significantly worse outcomes of the children of these households and respondents (as already clearly seen in the child enrollment data), thus perpetuating intergeneration al vulnerability associated with the attacks on the three IDP camps. VII. Recommendations Any reparations awards or programs should be based on close consultation with the victim participant population. Based on our study findings we offer the following r ecommendations. 1. Accurately target services and provide support to those most affected Certain groups are more affected than others and require additional support. These groups include: victims of greater numbers of alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity ; women (who in general report worse outcomes than men); victims of sexual assault (both men and women); individuals who have been abducted ; and women who bore a child due to sexual relations with a member of the LRA. Our data show the increased negative outcomes experienced by these populations and conclude that their needs should be prioritized when conceptualizing and implementing holistic support services and reparations. Support should also be provided with consideration for the condition of the household as a whole. Our findings clearly show the relationship between household level disability and experience of more alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity with greater food insecurity and less wealth, fewer assets, and worse health acces s, worse access to potable water and less ability to access to education . 2. Provide and strengthen psychosocial support Psychosocial services need to be provided to the affected population considering the poor state of their mental health as shown on the AYPA scale. Women in general suffer worse mental health outcomes, but particularly those who lost or witnessed the death of their child. With newer research investigating the intergenerational impact of armed conflict, psychosocial support should also be prioritized for women who have had children due to LRA -perpetrated sexual violence. These services should target the women and their children in order to address psychosocial impairment but also issues surrounding stigma and shame. We also recommend community -wide sensitization as part of a civic engagement process to educate the larger community on the needs and realities o f these women and their children. Without community acceptance, these groups will continue to experience social isolation, which impacts mental health, sustainable livelihoods, and access to opportunities. 73 Victoria, C.G., Adair, L., Fall, C., et al.

American Economic Review 84, 369 -395 ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 74 fic.tufts.edu Given the high level of disability reported in t hese communities and the rural locations of two of the three sites, these services would ideally be provided through regular mobile services. Given the low level of wealth, psychosocial services have to be highly subsidized or preferably free and should be available on an on-going basis. Further, given the priority that must be placed on women and their children, we recommend that providers be female and trained in providing services to highly traumatized populations who have experienced gender -based viole nce. 3. Provide and strengthen disability support Disability support and services need to be provided to respondents reporting physical and psychological impairment to themselves or other members of their households due to the LRA attacks. Given that disability is the main predictor of food security, regular support in cash or livelihoods support is needed to improve the food security of those with disabled members due to the attacks. While livelihood support is present for some households, it is not su fficient when two thirds of the victim participant population has a physical or mental disability, with the majority of household members as dependents. Direct and regular monetary disability support likely needs to be provided considering the effect of th e disability on a survivor's ability to work and the effect of this on them and their household's wellbeing. 4. Provide specialized therapeutic health services Affected individuals suffer from debilitating physical and mental disabilities and report not ha ving access to the services they need and medications and treatments they require for therapeutic treatment. Thus, specialized medical support needs to be provided free of charge to the survivors who are physically and mentally debilitated. This support should include their transportation, care while they are receiving services, and all follow up care necessary to ensure their fullest recovery. As detailed in the qualitative interviews, many participants experience being haunted by spirits, which most closely aligns with western conceptions of mental illness. Given the rich tradition of the Acholi and Langi people it is vital that support be directed at traditional healing approaches as well. We recommend that both western and traditional therapeutic suppor ts be made available, as some respondents may need to seek both to address a wide variety of issues. 5. Provide educational support Given the high level of disability and poor psychosocial wellbeing of the victim participant population, children, including those orphaned, are often required to work to supplement household income. This trend is having a devastating effect on their school enrollment and attendance and future prospects. Thus, financial support is needed to the household cover all hidden costs in school fees and to allow children of affected individuals and households to stay in school and attend school regularly. It will be important that any kind of livelihood support provided is done with consideration of who will be utilizing it in the ho usehold, considering the high level of disability and whether this could incentivize lower school attendance. Further, we recommend that teachers who are working with war -affected populations in northern Uganda receive specialized training on compassion and understanding when teaching such populations and enhancing their social acceptance. Research shows that even when former child soldiers or children born of rape by the LRA had access to education post -conflict, many were unable to continue due to lack o f ASSESSMENT OF VICTIM PARTICIPANT POPULATION IN PROSECUTOR V. DOMINIC ONGWEN 75 fic.tufts.edu awareness and stigmatization by their teachers and their classmates. 77F78 Therefore, enhanced psychoeducation and learning materials are necessary to ensure war -affected populations are able to continue in school. 6. Focus efforts to improve maternal and child health and nutrition UNICEF's conceptual framework on malnutrition highlights the role of food security, access to health services, wealth, education, and potable water access. Based on our findings in all these areas (reported above), we conclude that c hildren living in the victim participant population have worse nutritional outcomes than the general population. The possible resulting stunting of this population's children could further penalize this population and their potential recovery by affecting their children's current and future health and cognitive capacities. Considering the negative long -term, inter -generational impact that is likely occurring, extra attention and support needs to be provided to children and affected pregnant mothers. The ty pe of support would depend on the identified need, but could include complementary feeding, micronutrient supplementation (for children and pregnant mothers), zinc supplementation, vitamin A supplementation, iron-folic supplementation for pregnant mothers, and maternal calcium supplementation. 78F79 7. Physical and/or monetary compensation for lost assets and destroyed livelihoods and land restoration The extensive looting and destruction of people's property during the attacks inflicted long- term damage to their lives and livelihoods. Given the loss of livestock, large -scale food production with the aid of oxen is almost impossible \u2014contributing to the high level of food insecurity and low wealth and assets among the victims population. The long -term impact and inability to recover the assets lost during the attack on the three IDP camps is apparent in current household asset ownership, the MSI, and in t he qualitative respondent interviews. Given the destruction of physical capital (assets), human capital (as evidenced through the dependency ratio, massive loss of life and current educational enrollment and attendance), affected households need to be pro vided with livelihood support (in -kind or cash) to boost up their productive asset ownership and hence increase production. However, as noted above, given the high level of physical and emotional disability, in some cases direct monetary compensation for the loss of assets and livelihoods would need to be provided to affected individuals. We also found that some victims are denied their right to claim and use their natal family's land or had their land and property stolen from them, especially women whose parents were killed due to the attack; who are widowed, customarily unmarried, separated, or divorced; and those who were abducted and returned with children born of rape. Any support towards livelihoods should also consider the fate of these victims who, without land, might not be able to utilize any of the livelihoods support made available to them.

Memorialization Victim participants spoke of the need to recognize what happen to them and, where possible, put in place community structures such as schools, health facilities or vocational training centers that will provide services needed by them and their communities. They also said community these structures can be a symbolic way of memorializing what happened to them and could serve to deter similar harms in the future. Thus, reparation to parti cipant victims needs to be multi -pronged, aimed at providing the required satisfaction, rehabilitation, restitution and compensation to victims, serve to restore victims' dignity, and uphold the memory of the harms they suffered.
