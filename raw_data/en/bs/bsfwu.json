[Browse the best natural deodorants for 2023](https://thompsontee.com/blog/best-natural-deodorant-axillary-hyperhidrosis/) [.](https://thompsontee.com/blog/best-natural-deodorant-axillary-hyperhidrosis/) 1. VINEGAR Vinegar \u2014 more specifically, apple cider vinegar \u2014 provides an impressive list of health benefits. It helps regulate blood sugar, flush out toxins, relieve heartburn and acid reflux and even aids in weight loss. When applied directly to the skin, vinegar also acts as an astringent to help remove bacteria and close up pores. If you sweat profusely, drinking a vinegar concoction or applying it directly to the sweaty area each night can help reduce sweat. Drink a mixture of 2 teaspoons of vinegar and one teaspoon of apple cider vinegar before breakfast, lunch and dinner. The drying effects should kick in within a few days or so. 2. GREEN AND BLACK TEA Drinking hot beverages like tea might seem counterintuitive to stopping sweat. But green tea contains magnesium and Vitamin B, which constrict your sweat glands and keep you calm \u2014 [goodbye stress sweating](https://thompsontee.com/stress-sweating/)! If you sweat too much, try swapping out your morning coffee for green tea to get in on these sweat-blocking benefits. If you experience constant underarm sweating, black tea also has astringent properties that can reduce sweat when applied directly to your skin. After brewing black tea (and allowing it to cool), rub the tea on your underarms with a towel (or the tea bag itself) for a few minutes. 3. THOMPSON TEE SWEAT PROOF SHIRTS Wearing a sweat proof undershirt like the Thompson Tee is a natural, non-toxic way to block excessive underarm sweat. If you aren't keen on applying kitchen products to your pits, the Thompson Tee is an excellent, effective alternative. Armed with patented sweatproof technology, these shirts completely absorb underarm sweat and release it as vapor \u2014 so no one has to see those embarrassing sweat marks. While most moisture-wicking materials are treated with harsh chemicals that wear off after a couple of washes, Thompson Tees are made from natural rayon from bamboo and premium combed cotton. Not only do they last longer than other undershirts but the sweat-absorbing abilities also endure well beyond a handful of washes. [Try a Thompson Tee risk-free for 30 days today.](https://thompsontee.com/) 4. CORNSTARCH AND BAKING SODA Cornstarch and baking soda are naturally water-absorbing agents. Because baking soda is alkaline, it counteracts the bacteria-loving acids in sweat and acts as a natural deodorant. Many store-bought deodorants even contain baking soda for this very reason. Make sure your underarms are dry, and apply a hefty mixture of the two directly to the sweaty area each night. Let it sit for 30 minutes before rinsing off with water. As a forewarning, leaving on the concoction too long could create uncomfortable side effects. When I tried this about a year ago, I left baking soda on for the entire day, which irritated my skin and turned my armpits beet red. The baking soda also left a burning sensation, so I did not attempt this hack again. 5. WHEATGRASS JUICE A natural detoxifier, wheatgrass juice is also rich in vitamin A, C, B12, B6 and folic acid. By neutralizing and diluting the toxins in the blood, drinking just a tablespoon of wheatgrass a day helps fight sweat. If your sweat is especially pungent, you're in luck! Wheatgrass juice also reduces odor from sweat. 6. POTATOES AND OTHER POTASSIUM-RICH FOODS Consuming too much sodium will cause your body to retain more water. Potassium-rich foods like potatoes and broccoli reverse this process to help push water out of the body. Because of this response, potatoes are known to absorb excess water and help relieve sweating. Simply rub a potato slice across your armpits for a few minutes daily to experience these drying effects. 7. TOMATO JUICE Beyond the [cancer-fighting benefits](https://www.aicr.org/cancer-prevention/food-facts/tomatoes/), tomato juice also shrinks your pores and can reduce chronic sweat. Eating a tomato-rich diet or simply drinking a glass of tomato juice each day will help you control excessive sweating. If tomatoes aren't your thing, try applying tomato juice to your underarms (or wherever you sweat most) and let it sit for at least 10 minutes before rinsing off. [Learn more foods that reduce excessive sweating](https://thompsontee.com/blog/10-foods-that-reduce-excessive-sweating/). 8. TEA TREE OIL Like tea and vinegar, tea tree oil acts as an astringent to fight sweat-causing bacteria. Soak a cotton ball in tea tree oil, and blot it on your underarms daily. The effects should start to show in a few days. 9. LEMON The acid in lemon makes it a perfect candidate to naturally reduce excessive sweating. You can either rub half a lemon on your underarms (while lightly squeezing to extract the liquid) or mix a small amount of lemon juice with baking soda and apply it with a cotton pad. Try to leave the lemon juice on for at least 30 minutes, and rinse thoroughly. 10. WITCH HAZEL Witch hazel is a great home remedy for sweaty armpits. An herb found in nature, [witch hazel acts as an astringent and antiperspirant](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/witch-hazel-benefits-uses). It dries out your skin and closes your pores to prevent sweating. There are two ways to curb sweat with witch hazel. The first is to apply [liquid witch hazel](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VV0E90/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thompsontee20-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B000VV0E90&linkId=759925fbaae51c182a95baa15cb5b922) with a cotton ball to the areas you sweat the most. You can also combine equal parts of water and [hazel bark powder](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E3GHDMU/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thompsontee20-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00E3GHDMU&linkId=05ff719dcdb640868550ca9325646948) to make a paste. Apply the paste to your skin, and let it sit for an hour before rinsing it off with water. Although you probably don't have witch hazel sitting in your medicine cabinet, you can also use the solution as an astringent for your face, to remove your makeup \u2014 or even treat dandruff. 11. SALT Salt for drier pits? You betcha. Salt absorbs sweat, blocks your pores, and keeps your skin dry. You have a couple of options when using salt as a home remedy for hyperhidrosis. First, try rubbing sea salt crystals on your sweaty areas. You can even carry around a bottle of crystals to use whenever you feel a sweat session coming on. If that doesn't work, combine equal parts salt and lime juice to make a citrus scrub. Rub the solution onto your skin, rinse it off and enjoy sweating less! 12. WHITE SANDALWOOD POWDER White sandalwood powder is another natural astringent. Combine one tablespoon each of white sandalwood powder, rose water, and lemon juice to make a home remedy for hyperhidrosis. Mix the concoction until paste forms. Next, wash and dry your skin thoroughly, and apply the paste to your skin. Be sure to let it harden completely. After 20-30 minutes, rinse your skin with warm water. Repeat this process every day to reduce sweating. 13. COCONUT OIL [Coconut oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06VZ3SRGD/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thompsontee20-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06VZ3SRGD&linkId=4ca66f7fd9b8a21468b9e0fb4b29082f) seems to cure just about every ailment these days \u2014 sweat and odor included. That's because the superfruit contains lauric acid, which kills sweat-causing bacteria due to its antimicrobial properties. Here's how to use coconut oil to help with excess sweat and odor: - Combine 10 grams of crushed [camphor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U379V8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thompsontee20-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B002U379V8&linkId=b2d69c08e3f54acd0bbbee1b2121cb37)and 1 cup of coconut oil. - Mix the ingredients together and apply the paste to your body - Leave it on your skin for 45 minutes to an hour - Rinse it off with water You can also apply [cold-pressed coconut oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06VZ3SRGD/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=thompsontee20-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B06VZ3SRGD&linkId=4ca66f7fd9b8a21468b9e0fb4b29082f) to your skin after every shower or bath as you would a regular moisturizer. Do this regularly to [decrease excessive sweat](https://thompsontee.com/blog/sweating-too-much-how-to-fix-it/). 3 WAYS TO STOP SWEATING ON FACE NATURALLY We've covered a lot of natural sweat solutions so far. But what should you do if you sweat excessively from your head or face instead of your [armpits](https://thompsontee.com/blog/how-to-prevent-underarm-sweat-an-exhaustive-list-of-solutions/)? Not to fear - you can use many of the same home remedies to curb craniofacial hyperhidrosis, or extreme sweating of the scalp and face. Test out these natural sweat remedies first: NATURAL ASTRINGENTS Applying a natural astringent to your face or scalp can help curb sweating. Tea tree oil, witch hazel, vinegar, black and green tea (sage tea, chamomile tea) are all great home remedies for head and face sweating. Apply your favorite ingredient to your skin with a cotton ball before bed and wash it off in the morning. ESSENTIAL OILS Oils such as cypress, lavender, lemon, lime, niaouli, peppermint, petitgrain, and pine help prevent and regulate excess moisture and absorb humidity. You can implement any of these in your skincare routine - just make sure it fits your skin type to prevent unwanted side effects like outbreaks. Moreover, essential oils are best used with carrier oils to dilute them. DIET CHANGES Avoid spicy foods and caffeine, both of which can cause you to sweat more than usual on your head and face. Eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day to regulate digestion, which also produces body heat. MORE TIPS ON HOW TO STOP SWEATING NATURALLY Beyond home remedies, there are a few more easy and natural methods you can try to reduce sweating overall: Stop Smoking Nicotine in cigarettes raises your internal body temperature and increases your heart rate. This causes your sweat glands to start working overtime, producing excessive sweat. Smoking is known to cause a multitude of other health problems, from stained teeth to cancer. So if you're looking to make a lifestyle change, curbing your smoking habit is a great natural way to stop sweating. Cut Down on Caffeine Much like nicotine, caffeine stimulates the central nervous system and increases your heart rate. The raised body temperature that accompanies hot coffee and tea drinks can cause your body to produce more sweat. Try decreasing your caffeine intake (or eliminating it completely) to reduce excessive sweating.
