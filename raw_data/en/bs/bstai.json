Excepting a few athletes who had trainers with a knowledge of applied movements the value of manipulation was almost unknown in Europe sixty years ago. It was about 1890 as near as we can find out that a few manipulators were made available to European Army officers who were members of very exclusive officers clubs. These officers soon found out that this type of manipulation enabled them to retain their physical and mental vigor longer so a demand was created for manipulators for the various clubs. These clubs absorbed about all the good manipulators available and left very few for the ordinary soldier or civilian, in fact the training of surplus manipulators was definitely not encouraged as most officers felt that such luxury was a little too good for the common herd. Some of the officers from wealthy families retired at an early age and went into their fathers established business. This created a demand for manipulators for the so called 'millionaires clubs,' these were largely supplied from the army clubs, friends of the retired officers or those too old for the new crop of gallant young officers. This, of course, created a demand for a few manipulators as replacements. These replacements were usually friends of those who had jobs as manipulators and may or may not have had some knowledge of Anatomy. Thru this custom most club manipulators degenerated to what is now known as 'Bath house rubbers.' Thru some miracle or the will of God a few educated people kept the seed alive; thru trying to make fair soldiers out of sickly young aristocrats these manipulators discovered that manipulations were definitely worth trying on the sick and disabled. 1898: DeHesse (1946, pp. 9-11) reports:During the Spanish American war the United States imported Dr. T. Bergren to train members of the Medical Corps in giving manipulation to the sick and disabled, and by sick and disabled I mean Soldiers not just Officers. Let us assume it was our American sense of freedom and fair play that made this possible. Dr. Bergren was made a Captain in the U.S. Medical Corps and later obtained employment at the Kellogg Sanitarium, in Michigan; thru his connection there his system of manipulation was made available to the general public. At last after three thousand years the hopes of the Greek philosophers was partly realized, not for the Greeks we admit, but for the Americans. Dr. Bergren was not the only one who made his art available to ordinary folks, many others followed, but at least he definintely was one of the pioneers. The number of manipulations known at that time was only a part of what we use today but the principles of manipulation had been well founded and it definitely was a good start in the right direction. The text book published by Dr. Bergren in 1910 called The Art of Curative Gymnastics is of more than historical value, many of the manipulations described in that book are still in use today. In the good old days when a manipulator did not know how to move an area or joint by manipulation he tried to induce the patient to move that area by a more or less scientific system of gymnastics, as our knowledge of movements increased we relied less on exercise and gymnastics and more on our ability to move an area by manipulative body mechanics. At the present time we make sure a joint or body area is moving properly by applying manipulation and joint movements and then instruct the patient to keep himself right by taking a scientific amount of exercise and bymnastics. Manipulative movements are simply an assured application of the principles of exercise and gymnastics, when the movements are applied to a person he cannot escape them and a stiff area cannot remain immovable long under the hands of a skilled manipulator. Manipulation of the P.H. Ling type met with indifference and downright opposition in America in the years that followed, many uninformed persons said it was merely a cheap copy of Chiropractic and others maintained it was empirical quackery, at best it was considered an expensive luxury. During the first World War the U.S. Army employed a few fairly good massage therapists. One of the best of them, an Army Major was definitely a fighter for the rights of those who came under the care of his Medical staff for treatment. He was a rehabilitation therapist of the old applied movement massage and curative gymnastics school. He insisted that all soldiers under his care have the usual Medical and surgical care plus Physical Therapy which was a combination of Manipulation, Heat, Electric treatment and Exercise. The soldiers who had the benefits of physical therapy in addition to the usual treatment did so much better than those who had only the old fashioned medical and surgical attention that the U.S. Government eventually installed physical therapy departments in nearly all of the hospitals which cared for re-habilitation cases in the latter part of the war and retained these departments for the war worn1and wounded for many years after the war. In fact nearly all Government hospitals of today have a Physical Therapy Department. 1904 (Jan 2): JAMA [XLII: 57] reports: 17. Mechanotherapy. - Taylor points out the importance of massage, mechanotherapy, bone setting, etc., and the practice of osteopathy. He thinks the profession has become too critical in regard to drugs, and the public has followed its example, and takes up the more readily with charlatans, who claim to cure without them. Moreover, there are comparatively few of the medical profession who have familiarized themselves with massage and mechanotherapy generally. Our schools of massage are entirely superficial in their training. The European masseur finds our physicians unable to appreciate his skill, hence his attempt to get into independent practice, and the prejudice and rivalry aroused against him. Taylor claims that the field of mechanotherapy is boundless, and it is the duty of the educated physician to learn more of it. He thinks if the medical profession would read half a score of small books thoroughly (after revising their knowledge of the nervous mechanisms) and make practical use of the light thus gained, they would feel little hesitation in going forward to acquire skill in so practical and valuable a branch of therapeutics. The physician can not devote the time required by some of the more laborious and continuous, or routine procedures, but he should supervise the scientific part. He could and should make use of the more delicate manipulations, which are of the greatest value. To illustrate the teachings of the osteopathic schools, he mentions two graduates of Scandinavian massage institutions who came to this country and hearing of osteopathy took a course at Kirksville. Both assured the author that they learned no facts of importance not already known to them. The sphere of manual therapy lies in the ability of medical practitioners to influence centers of organic activity by mechanical stimulation through the vasomotor nerves. They should not abandon well-tried and proven remedies, but in manual therapy, when applied by the physician, there is a prompt and exact method far in advance of all others in the treatment of a wide variety of derangements, not only of the coarser mechanisms, but also of the vital organs. 1916-18: Arthur V Nilsson is inducted into the Swedish army, served until 1918, according to Los Angeles District CCA News Bulletin (1951 [July]; 2(2):1) 1917: in discussing the Mayo brothers' role as surgical advisors to William C. Gorgas, M.D., Surgeon General of the United States, in matters relating the the Medical Reserve Corps, Clapesattle (1941, p. 564) relates: The brothers' principle task was 'to insure and maintain, as far as possible, the proper standard of character and professional ability in the medical men taken into the medical service [about 40,000 of them], and to plan ways and means for their special training.' It was their job too, until a special committee (with Henry Plummer as one of its members) was appointed for the purpose, to judge the worth of the scores of devices and methods recommended by would-be inventors for use in the army medical services. One of the ticklish matters they had to manage was the insistent requests from chiropractors, osteopaths, and chiropodists for admission to the medical corps. Each of these groups had legislation pending in Congress to give them equal rank with regular physicians and surgeons, and they wanted the sanction of the surgeon general as support in securing passage of their bills. Dr. Will and Dr. Charlie did not scornfully advise peremptory rejection of their claims, because they saw a possible use for all of them in the army service, particularly in the rehabilitation of disabled soldiers, but of course they could not concede them the authority or responsibility of medical officers.Clapesattle H.

Also instantly stopped a headache for one of the boys. They could not understand how it could be done by adjusting the spine.... 1917 (Nov 24): FHN [A.C. 23][7(11)] notes: -Wm B Buck DC is with the 23rd Infantry Medical Department, part of the U.S. Allied Expeditionary Force in France (p 6) -an editorial is reprinted from the New York Tribune (pp 15-6): BONE SETTING IN WAR TIME A few months ago a British major general of some note made a plea on behalf of one of the most renowned exponents of manipulative surgery, asking why it was that his services had never been sought or accepted by the government, seeing they were so singularly adapted to the urgent needs of the day. He was followed by many others, including a number of grateful patients, who had been wounded in the war and who, after prolonged treatment at the hands of the orthodox, had been cured promptly by the famous bonesetter. [Sir Herbert A Barker] A desultory discussion of the merits of osteopathy was carried on for some time in the press, and at last a question was put in the House of Commons 'whether some of the leading exponents of 'manipulative surgery' had offered to give their services free to suffering soldiers and their offers had been rejected.' The representative of the War Office admitted that professionally unqualified bonesetters were notemployed by the government, thereby laying himself open to a series of questions plainly designed to promote a reconsideration of the merits of unorthodox forms of surgical treatment. The advocates of manipulative surgery have been waiting for an opportunity of this kind for a long time. The status of osteopathy and allied systems is not so clearly established in England as it is here - at least in this state. Six years ago there was an important trial for damages which it was hoped would clear up the question of the so- called bonesetters' liability. Unfortunately it failed, for though the jury found in favor of the plaintiff, who had lost a leg through alleged negligence in the performance of a manipulative operation, the damages awarded were so ridiculously small that the verdict could only be regarded as an absurd sort of compromise. Probably no event could possibly have done better service to the osteopaths, for though the operator was nominally discredited, he really secured a magnificent advertisement, and the array of witnesses he called testified to his skill so wholeheartedly that the single failure counted for nothing in the eyes of the public. But there were other circumstances that tended still more to enhance his fame. A physician of excellent standing, who had worked for many years as medical officer of the Westminster Union, had been so deeply impressed by the value of the bonesetter's work that he consented to help him in the quality of anaesthetist. This was, of course, unprofessional conduct, and he was solemnly warned by the medical council. Nevertheless, he refused as a matter of conscience to dissolve the partnership, the result being that his name was struck off the register on a charge of infamous conduct. Then a terrible thing happened. One of the most successful surgeons in England, a past president of the British Medical Association and an operator of world-wide fame, so completely forgot his standing as to come out with a violent denunciation of the profession, accusing his fellows of prejudice, bigotry and unreasoning jealousy, and incidentally praising the bonesetter's work to the skies, declaring that from personal experience he knew there were few regular practitioners in England who could vie with it in certain cases, and strongly advising them to reconsider the new methods, as he had considered them, with an open mind and with due regard to the results. This was all highly encouraging to the advocates of manipulative surgery, and no doubt it will be recalled in the endeavor to win over the War Office. It is alleged that the medical profession in France has already availed itself of the services of these irregular experts, and this argument, too, has been used in the plea for 'a dilution of labor' in the surgical field. A difficulty remains, however. Even supposing there are miracle workers among the bonesetters, ought not the dangers as well as the possible advantages of uncertified practice be kept in mind? For, after all, the laws providing against irregular practitioners were designed for the protection of the public, and the barriers that have been put up are the result of long experience. Are they to be torn down merely because some skilful hands have failed to gain admission? For the rest, there is no law against osteopathy or any other form of surgery; the laws, such as they are, were designed only to keep out the manifestly incompetent. And the osteopaths in England are not worse off than a rabble of cranks and professors of new systems in this country, all of whom would be at perfect liberty to ride their several hobbies to their hearts' content if only they would take the pains to acquire that minimum of education which, however inadequate it may be, serves in some measure to save the public from the downright imposter and quack. 1917 (Dec 1): FHN [A.C. 23][7(12)] notes (p 5): DOING WAR DUTY Always glad to hear from Chiropractors in Uncle Sam's serice wherever they may be. This letter is from TJ Boner DC, who wascalled from a very successful practice at Princeton, Ill., to stand by the flag: San Pedro, Cal., November 8, 1917 BJ Palmer, DC, PhC, Davenport, Iowa Dear Doctor: Received a copy of THE FHN today and am glad to see so many of our Chiropractors have joined the service. I hope more do, for a man who would not join the colors now if he is physically fit is not worthy of being a Chiropractor. I agree with the man who said there are but two classes, one traitor and the other patriot. I am in the medical department of the navy, and every day I get in a lot of good work. The very nature of the work for the men at this place (a submarine base) is such that they have a good deal of back and neck trouble. I have the pleasure of adjusting every one of these cases, in fact every day I have quite a clinic, and the senior medical officer makes no fuss about it. If the case comes to his notice he sends to me at once. Some time ago a young fellow came in who had fallen out of his hammock and hurt his neck; when I came in I gave him a T.M. (time was valuable) and he said, 'That is a Chiropractic adjustment.' Then I found out that his father is a PSC man and president of the Oregon state board. In this I wish to advise you of my new address. Sincerely, TJ Boner, US Submarine Base, San Pedro Cal. 1917-18: \"Among the many tales from chiropractic's early days in Europe, one of the most frequently told refers to the World War 1 and its trenches. Professional talk has it that some American boy delivered the first chiropractic adjustment on the old continent to either a 'tommy' or a 'poilu' while fighting alongside them. This has never been documented, but it is a good possibility that a few early chiropractors were drafted into the U.S. Army, and so were in a position to act professionally while on trench duty in the Champagne and Argonne battlefields.\" (Gaucher-Peslherbe, 1992) 1918 (Jan letter to BJ from WG Hoffman DC of Battle Creek MI noting that he has received payment from the War Department for treatment of a soldier whom the medics had given up on; notes he had to struggle for payment, but received it 1918 (Feb): National (School) Journal of Chiropractic notes: -\"Letters from the front\" (p. 23; bound volume p. 296): \"Camp Greene, Nov. 30, 1917 Dear Dr. Schulze, Dr. Forster, Dr. Juhl and you all, or as we say here in the Sunny South, Y'all: At last I am taking time to drop you a few lines or rather that long-promised letter, and let you know how things are in the army. So first of all I think you will be interested to know what I'm doing. I have charge of the whole G.U. Wards, that is to say, of course, as far as the authority of a Ward Master goes, I am in absolute authority. I am the only Ward Master at the Base who has charge of more than one ward and at present I am Ward Master over four wards and yesterday was made a first-class Private and am to take an examination next week for Sergeant. Incidentally, I might tell you that I have applied for a transfer to the third officers' training camp and my application, I understand, has been approved by Major Sheep. Should I be successful, I will be transferred to Plattsburgh for a three months' training and on passing an exam, there, will be commissioned a Second Lieutenant, with the chance of promotion right along the line. Well, I believe I was telling you of my work. As you may understand, nealy all of the G.U. work in the army is confined to venereals. My morning report to the Adjutant this A.M. was a follows: Urethritis, gonorrhoeal, acute 23 cases Syphilis, second stage 3 cases Symphilis and gonorrhoea both 11 casesPara-phimosis and gonorrhoea both 3 cases Phimosis and gonorrhoea both 5 cases Epididymitis, gonorrhoeal 9 cases Buboes suppurating 17 cases Venereal warts 2 cases Cystitis 3 cases Chancroids 18 cases Varicocele 3 cases Circumcisions 7 cases Rheumatism, gonorrhoeal 3 cases The last named cases have been given up by my Lieutenants, the Ward Surgeons, who are in absolute charge and have been given over to me to handle; not that they have any faith in Chiro, as you may well understand, but just to give me something to fall down on, or rather I believe their hopes to be centered in that. I have two of the finest Lieutenants one could possibly wish to meet. Dr. Ross, who is the ranking officer and who is the REAL BOSS, not bigoted, is a perfect gentleman.... 1918 (Apr): National (School) Journal of Chiropractic notes: -\"Manipulative the Army\" (pp. 21-3; bound volume pp. 343-5): Fifteen thousand physicians have volunteered their services to care for our soldiers and have been commissioned in the army of the United States. That they will do wonderful work goes without saying. They will restore to usefulness many a man who, without the expert care they will receive, would probably be doomed to a life of helplessness or even lose his life. Proper surgical measures will meet many of the indications presented by different cases, but they will not meet them all. In England a man has demonstrated that manipulative measures are accomplishing wonderful results in cases which can be reached in no other way. In this country we know that adjustments and other measures commonly coming under the head of physical therapy would be of inestimable value in the care of many of our stricken soldier boys. Both the osteopaths and the chiorpractors have tried in vain to receive permission to employ their skill in this direction but without avail. We know absolutely that we could do a world of good in many cases that medical and surgical procedures will not benefit in the slightest degree. We are willing to be tyested int his regard and show what we can do, and there are millions of people in this land of ours that would like nothing better than to see us given an opportunity to demonstrate our worth. But our most earnest efforts to get some kind of a hearing have been unavailing, and as a result there are going to be a number of men, perhaps thousands of them, after this war, who will be left helpless just because they were deliberately denied the privilege of using a form of treatment which those men whom we have placed in a position of authority refuse to recognize. Is this fair to our soldiers who are fighting our battles for us? Should not everything which has the slightest claim to recognition be thoroughly investigated to determine whether or not it might be of some benefit to our soldiers? When a mother's child is sick she will try everything in her frantic efforts to save its life and she will overlook nothing that offers the slightest hope. We are confornted witht he same precise problem. Various forms of disease and injury will be suffered by our soldiers and there shold be in a position of authority some one whose business it is to investighate everything which is proposed as a remedial agent in the care of such conditions. The man who has this work in charge should have no strings tied to him; he should be open-minded and open to conviction and unprejudiced; he should be conversant with the principles of medicine, surgery, osteopathy, chiropractic, and every other therapeutic measure which has ever been employed in the treatment of disease. In only that way will our soldiers receive the kind of attention to which they are so preeminently entitled. Mr. Barker has demonstrated to the satisfaction of every intelligent person in Great Britain that his methods are indicated andshould be employed in many cases, but the War Office refuses to avail itself of his services because he is not a medical man. The same reason has prevented the osteopaths and chiropractors from giving their services to our soldiers here. This should not be. If there is anything which will help any appreciable percentage of our boys they should get that help. And we can prove to the entire satisfaciton of anyone that chiropractic adjustments will restore to healtha nd a useful life soldiers who will otherwise be doomed to an existence which will handicap them for the balance of their life. Why not give us a chance? Let on responsible man who is a chiropractor and also has a knowledge of other measures spend one week in a camp in this country or on the front in France and show what can be done. He can work under the direct supervision of the Commanding Officer so that ther need be nothing irregular in the procedure. Then let them make a combined report and let that be the basis for more extensive work along these lines. The press in both this country and England has said much in support of manipulative measures. Many medical men have expressed themselves publicly as being convinced that osteopathic and chiropractic methods would be beneficial in many cases. Here is an extract from an editorial in \"The Truth,\" an English newspaper, which cites just one case showing what can be done by manipulative measures: \"The evidence which Mr. Barker marshals against Sir Watson Cheyne relates principally to injuries to the semi-lunar cartilage, in the treatment of which he has particularly distinguished himself, and on which Sir Watson Cheyne imprudently challenged him. But when injuries to soldiers are in question, nothing that Mr. Barker has ever accomplished seems more conclusive of the whole matter than the case of the man in the Sherwood Forresters which was described in TRUTH last year, at the beginning of the whole controversy. This man had sustained a complicated injhury to the knee-joint which completely disabled him, and the overwhelming effect of the case lies in the fact that he had been under treatment for fourteen months in several different hospitals, as the result of which all the eminent surgeons who tried their hands on him could do nothing for him, and eventually recommended his discharge from the army, which was carried out with a pension at the expense of the British taxpayer. \"This man entered Mr. Barker's consultating-room wearing a cumbrous iron instrument to support his leg at the knee - the last word of orthodox surgery upon his case. He walked out restored whole, leaving the precious instrument behind him. What all the surgical skill at the disposal of the War Office could not do in fourteen months, Mr. Barker had done in about that number of minutes. \"In the face of such a demonstration as this, what is the use of eminent surgeon, or fifty eminent surgeons, getting up and telling laymen who know the facts that Mr. Barker may \"do very good work,\" but that Faculty know all about his methods and employ them whenever they think it is desirable? How can intelligent and educated men like Sir Watson Cheyne make such a lamentable exhibition of themselves and their craft? I suppose they content themselves with the reflection that the opinion of the laity is of no consequence, even on a mere matter of evidence. But it is not the laity. Mr. Barker can produce dozens of lawfully qualified medical witnesses, and among them surgeons whom even Sir Watson Cheyne is not entitled to sneeze at. That is the best assurance of the ultimate issue of this controversy.\" (pp. 21-23; bound volu me pp. 343-5) -letter from Walter C. McAlister DC, stationed with the 217 Aero Squadron, Kelly Field, Texas, writes (p. 23; bound volume p. 345): The National School of Chiropractic Gentlemen: I will not have time to write much a letter this time, but I have something good up my sleeve to tell you when I do get around to it.We are leaving this morning for parts unknown, unless the orders are changed. I have had an almost unborken line of success in curing headaches and am getting a little reputation started. The funny thing about it is the surprise my patients profess after an adjustment. Last week I ran across a man who had suffered with Neuralgia of the face and head for five days. In fact, he was bedridden. I was eager to get a crack at him, so asked permission to try. He was feeling pretty crabbed but said \"Anything is better than this.\" He was full of dope and Aspirin. I got him down, cracked his nck, gave him a massage and then let him up. \"Boys,\" he shouted, \"You may call me a d___ liar, but I haven't a pain.\" Two more treatments were necessary to reduce the swelling; and he is cured. The best compliment I have pulled down so far was from our Company Commander. He recommended a sick headache patient to me, rather than to send him to the infirmary. He said \"There is a fellow down the line who cures headaches by cracking their necks - better see him.\" Very few ever heard of Chiro. but are more or less familiar with Osteopathy. I expect a Sergeant to drop in at any moment for an adjustment. Will close and pack my knapsack for our move, and only hope that this time it is \"A Go Of It,\" as we have twice before received counter orders, after we were all ready. Your truly,... P.S.

I work from 8 o'clock A.M. to 5 o'clock P.M. It is very interesting work, but is is also very dangerous, owing to having to test out the different gases. They force this gas into a room and everyone has his turn at going into this gas room, with a gas mask on and stay as long as he can stand it. I was in for twenty-six minutes last Friday and have been on the sick list ever since. It came very near getting me but I am much better now, except for pains over my chest.

Ratledge, D.C. to B.J. Palmer, D.C. (Ratledge papers, CCCKC): Dear Dr. Palmer: In the matter of petitioning Congress relative to placing a Chiropractor as well as an Osteopath in each regiment in the army, reference being made to same in the F.H.N. of June 22nd. I would be pleased to have definite information as to the manner in which H.R. 5116 would place Chiropractors in such service. Kindly inform me, if you have such information at hand, whether or not a Chiropractor would be subject to orders from Medical officers, or whether he would be independent of them in his work.My reason for making this inquiry is that I would be opposed to Chiropractors entering the work where they were subject to orders from such medical or other officers who know nothing of Chiropractic. In my opinion, the only way Chiropractors could serve our country would be to be on their own responsibility in determining when and whether or not a man in the service should be adjusted, otherwise the Medical men would have a much better opportunity to belittle Chiropractic than in any other way. Then too, it would place Chiropractic in the minds of the soldiers as only a limited practice and secondary and inferior to the practice of medicine. Just as it is my belief, for the advancement of chiropractic in the interest of humanity, that we should keep the science of Chiropractic from becoming contaminated with therapy and slowly absorbed thereby in civil life, it is my sincere belief that the same course should be pursued in matters pertaining to Chiropractic service in the army and navy. Should we accept medical dictation in the army it would be the begining of a diluting process and ?%$? therapy that would in time destroy our great science and cheat the future of one of its greatest assets in the matter of health. Trusting that I may have an early reply and looking forward to your return to California next Fall, at which time California may really line up and show to the world that Chiropractic can and will stand alone, solely on its merits, I am, Yours for Chiropractic supremacy 1918 (July 13) Fountain Head News [A.C. 23][7(44)]: -notes that RD Haught DC (PSC, December 1917) is in Medical Department 146 Inf. 37 Division of the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe, had been stationed at Camp Lee, Petersburg VA (p. 2) OUR BOYS GO MARCHING ON More PSC students have joined the colors, and there are quite a number more on the verge of going, some of whom have only a few days or weeks left of their course and hang on in the hopes of getting through if possible before entering upon war duties, so that they may take their diplomas with them when they leave.

The keynote of the meeting was \"Chirorpactic for our soldiers.\" The enthusiasm was temendous and therefore the constructive business carried through was great in quantity and far reaching in its effects upon the future of Chiropractic. The constitution and by-laws declares every Chirorpactor in the land a member and an active one. No dues or assessments. All funds to be collected through voluntary contributions. The board ordered the organization of a nation-wide drive for at least $50,000 to be known as the \"Chiropractic for Our Soldiers Fund.\" Each state of the Union will be organized down to the smallest community.. All will be asked to contribute money and time. Be ready to respond to the call. No slackers will be tolderated. The fund raised will be used to promote governmental recognition of Chiropractors in the army and nave and to establish Chiropractic hospitals and relamation camps that will also demonstrate to the Government the value and merits of Chiropractic. This is distinctly your fight and the responsibility for success of this movement rests entirely upon you and us. A beautiful insignia has been adopted and will be given to every contributing Chiropractor. At once upon reading this letter, write to N.C. Ross, D.C., M.C., chairman of finance, 227 West Jefferson Street, Ft. Wayne, Ind. Tell him whether you will volunteer as a worker in the drive for funds to give Chiropractic to our soldiers. Let us hope the response will be immediate and universal. The hour has struck when Chiropractic must become the great factor in army health supervision that it deserves to be.

Gillespie Post No. 110, The American Legion, of Freeport, Pa., go on record as favoring the plan of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance to include Chiropractic in their new plan of regeneration for the disabled ex-service man or woman of the World War, and that the Adjutant forward a copy of this resolution to the Bureau of War Risk Insurance. Yours very truly, Post Adjutant. 1921 (Aug 1): letter from Arthur L. Sterns, D.C. in Pima County Jail, Tucson AZ, to Norine Hess Atchison, Secretary of the AZ Board in Phoenix (Archives of AZ BCE): Dear Madam: Your letter of July 29th received, and contents noted. Thanks for the Chiropractic Bill enclosed in it. I have been a two-year graduate from the Palmer School, since May, 1918, and at that time I was called to the service, which kept me from locating. I practiced the thirteen months I was in the service, arriving back in the States in July 1919. As I had to work my way thru school I did not have my diploma all paid for. Not wanting to open an office before I had my diploma, I went to work. Also, I got married and that cost me considerable. I went back to school about the middle of September, 1920, and stayed two months, reviewing my old and new work, and then came directly to Tucson. These are the things that hindered me from being in this state the two years required by the present bill. I am not asking for any personal leniency, but as you can easily see, I could not help conditions as they were. A man cannot stay away from the army and under the conditions, I did not want to, even if I could have. If these conditions warrant me having a license without examination, please forward me application blank at once, and I will fill it out and send to you. If not, please advise me when the first examination will be held, and I will appear at that time to take the same. Any opinion about the matter, or information that you can give me, will be greatly appreciated. The reason I am in jail is because in this state, as you no doubt know, that fine would go to the Medical Board, and that is too much like throwing a bone to a dog after he has bitten you, so I am serving my time. We are treated very nicely, but the worst thing is that I am not allowed to treat outside patients, and I have some that really need the adjustments. However, I have adjusted several fellow prisoners with excellent results. Hoping to hear form you often, I am, Chiropractically yours,... 1923 (Oct 20): FHN (A.C. writes: (pp. 8-9) Later the enrollment dates were designed to meet three times a year, January, May and September. That is the present plan. A carefully prepared chart of the enrollments of the past ten years shows that the September class is always the largest of those three. The January class is next in size and the May class is the smallest. Further study of this chart shows that, year by year, each successive year is a larger year than the year before. The September of a certain year would be larger than the September of the year before, the same being true of January and May, so that the scale kept gradually climbing. Then came the declaration of the Great World War. Many changes became necessary, but we kept on our climb even tho smaller jumps were indulged in for a few years. Then came the Armistice in November, 1918. From that day each successive class took a boom, what we now call our post-war boom classes. Why We Boomed This was accounted for in three ways:First - Many boys who contemplated taking up Chiropractic were called to war. When they were discharged THEY came. Second - Many boys first heard of Chiropractic taking adjustments during the war, and then and there resolved to take it up when discharged, when THEY came. Third - The vocational trainees were entitled to training. The Government saw fit to recognize our school first, and saw fit to pay more money for training at THE PSC then any other vocational training in any other school of any kind in the United States.

Chiropractors, who themselves were Veterans or Legionaires, later organized themselves for this purpose. But to the discredit of the powerful medically organized influence, such recognition has never yet been accorded tothis profession. Neither have Chiropractors been given positions of service during wartimes under their own department, and only on the quiet were they able to help suffering fellow soldiers whom medical physiotherapy couldn't cure. 1925 (Mar): Bulletin of the ACA [2(2)] notes: -\"Special Dispatch to The Graphic, Washington, March 30 (p. 16): US DENIES DISABLED VETS FREE CARE BY CHIROPRACTORS: In answer to scores of appeals by disabled veterans to the United States Veterans' Bureau for treatment by chiropractors or osteopaths, bureau attaches have made known that under the law veterans must pay for such treatments. It is pointed out that free hospital or clinical treatment for veterans must be administered by physicians graduated from the recognized medical schools, and further, all government physicians must pass a civil service examination. The law further provides that the government is prohibited from paying other than recognized medical practitioners for services rendered veterans. Any effort to change the existing restrictions it was indicated, would result in the most strenuous opposition from medical associations all over the country. 1925 (Apr/May): Bulletin of the ACA [2(3-4)] notes: -Leo L Spears DC discusses (p. 10): ...the fight I have been waging for three years to force the US Veterans' Bureau to supply Chiropractic adjustments to the disabled veterans at government expense, which fight has already cost me over $8,000 with no hopes of it ever benefitting me personally.

The DAV is the organization that determines what kind of soldier legislation shall or shall not be passed in Congress....If necessary you would lend financial support toward the sending of patients as committeemen and remember that you must work in a hurry. Delinquent action will be worse than useless. If you are a disabled man join a local chapter yourself so you can help appoint your patients as committeemen. Next. One of our greatest handicaps in Washington was the contention of the Veterans' Bureau and of Congressmen that there was no evidence of a demand for Chiropractic. Now it is up to us to supply that evidence in abundance. So get busy immediately, please, and get everyone of your present and former ex-service patients to put in separate requests for a refund for adjustments already taken and for authority to take more. The requests for authority to take additional adjustments should state the benefits received from adjustments already taken. Address them to Gen. Frank Hines, Director US Veterans' Bureau, Washington DC, so they will be on file there when we need them. It is also likely that authority will be issued within the next few weeks, as treat pressure is being exerted and two refunds for Chiropractic have already been made... -Editor notes LA Nash DC's training (p. 11): LA Nash DC, graduated from the Palmer School of Chiropractic in 1914 and practiced his profession in Carthage NY up to the entrance of the United States into the World War when he enlisted in the Medical Department of the United States Army.

Dr Nash's experience included every known phase of X-ray work. He acted as X-ray technician for many of the leading Roentgenologists of the United States.

But realizing that the ACA being a young organization is scarcely able to undertake the financing of such a tremendous and expensive project, I have decided to continue to carry the financial burden myself. Therefore, the ACA is hereby released from its finanical obligations in this fight. It has cost me many thousands of dollars already and will no doubt cost me at least ten thousand dollars more during the coming session of Congress. But since we have already won so closely to victory we must not stop until it is ours. Had the short session of Congress last year been a long one our legal battles would already be over. This year we must not falter at any price.

The idea is to get the organization formed with officers elected so that when we are ready to apply to the government for commissions, we will have a working unit in every state. There is nothing complicated about this organization. It is merely to bind the ex- service men chiropractors together in a unit so that we may use this unit for the good of chiropractic and for the good of the ex-service men. We are therefore asking all chiropractors who are ex-service men to list your name with the NCA state director so that the necessary information will be available to proceed with the organization. 1940 (July): The Herald of the Kolar Health Clinic (7[4]:4) reports: NAVY UNIT OF CHIROPRACTIC The National Chiropractic Association, thru the efforts of Dr. Emmett J. Murphy, National Legislative Representative, has presented to the Naval Affairs Committee of The House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. a brief in support of the establishment of a Chiropractic Department in the United States Navy. The well written brief undertakes to set forth six reasons for a Chiropractic unit in the Navy. Each of the propositions is supported by government statistics, census reports, or scientific facts and principles as set forth in papers and lectures of public import. In requesting such a Chiropractic unit it was recommended that the personnel be given an officer's rating in the Navy. 1940 (Sept): National Chiropractic Journal includes: -\"Resolutions Adopted\" at the NCA's convention in Minneapolis, including: Resolution on Army and Navy Commissions WHEREAS, many ex-service men are chiropractors who fought for their country in the last war and would again fight for the defense of their country, if necessary, and WHEREAS, these chiropractors, through years of research and experience realize the results of Chiropractic for the sick and disabled, andWHEREAS, chiropractors would gladly enlist to care for service men either in the army or navy in times of peace or war, provided they were granted commissions in the army and navy on the same basis as medical practitioners, and WHEREAS, the National Chiropractic Association is working militantly to accomplish these ends in the interests of national unity and the health and welfare of our armed forces: THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the formation of a Chiropractic Ex-Service Men's League in every state of the Union and in every Province of Canada, aiming to accomplish these ends, be given approval by the National Chiropractic Association in convention assembled in Minneapolis, with the hope that a Chiropractic Ex-Service Men's League will be formed in every state of the Union and in every Province of Canada, or in any other territorial jurisdiction in which Doctors of Chiropractic, who are ex- service men, reside.... Resolution on Disabled Veterans WHEREAS, we believe that many of the disabled veterans who have failed to respond to the medical treatment now afforded them could be rehabilitated through Chiropractic treatment, and WHEREAS, we further believe that the veteran should be accorded the same rights and privileges as enjoyed by every other citizen of the United States in the choice of the doctor and method of treatment, and WHEREAS, many state and local veterans' organizations have passed resolutions petitioning the Veterans' Bureau to provide Chiropractic treatment in Veterans' hospitals on the same basis as medical treatment, and WHEREAS, considerable of the taxpayers' money could be saved by the rehabilitation of veterans through the employment of chiropractors in veteran hospitals; THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the National Chiropractic Association cooperate with the disabled veteran by bringing the above facts to the attention of the various veterans' organizations and the Veterans' Bureau in Washington, D.C.... Resolutionon War Veteran Groups WHEREAS, it is evident that war veteran groups have done exceptional work in Washington to help disabled veterans of the World War of 1917-18, and WHEREAS, these war veteran groups are laboring untiringly for the welfare of the widows and orphans of war veterans; BE IT RESOLVED that the National Chiropractic Association, in convention assembled here in Minneapolis, endorse and commend the work done by these veteran groups in Washington, and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the National Chiropractic Association extend its every effort in helping these veterans groups gain the consideration and recognition they so richly deserve, and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the National Chiropractic Association, through its legislative representative in Washington, extend its full strength to assist these veterans groups to procure those things which to them will enhance their future health and happiness, and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that a copy of these resolutions be sent to the headquarters of the American Legion, Disabled Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Army and Navy Union. 1940 (Oct 4): TF Ratledge DC writes to CS Cleveland DC, congratulates CS for defending straight schools at NCA convention in Minneapolis against the NCA Council on Chiropractic Schools and WA Budden's efforts to introduce naturopathic concepts and mixer standards in accreditation process; notes BJ Palmer is enthusiastic re: ACEI; notes that military draft now hurting enrollment at Ratledge College (Ratledge papers-SFCR Archives)1940 (Oct 29): letter from Secretary of State Cordell Hull (Ratledge papers, CCC/KC): My dear Mr. Hull, Permit me to introduce myself first as an American and then as a Tennessean, born in the old Rock House between Dixon Springs and Hartsville, then the home of William Hankins, my grandfather. Suffice to say that for many years I have watched your career in public life with great interest by what my favorite uncle, the late Bob Hankins and others, told me of you. It is, therefore, not strange that I should have made efforts to promote your candidacy, or, more accurately, to have you drafted for the presidency of the United States of America. The enclosed letterhead will indicate to you that I helped plan just that in the State of California. In connection with the contemplated drafting of you for the high office of President my aunts, Hattie, Susan and Ophelia, furnished me with much intimate and personal material concerning you to have been used in the campaign had it come to pass that you should have been a candidate. Please accept my unreserved approval and highest coommendation upon your address over radio last Friday evening. It was a masterful presentation of typical and fundamental ideals and policies relating to human relations actually in operation. I am happy to know that American has you and Mr. Roosevelt in this time of world crisis to give voice to the principles of genuine democracy and in defense of decency, human rights and civilization. It is in no attempt to flatter when I say that the constant and clear presentation of democratic philosophy during these troublec years by you and the President has stood as a beacon to which every normal minded human has turned for hope of the future freedom and happiness of mankind. No administration has ever shown such understanding and vision with the ability and courage to tear away the masks of the cruel, power- mad tyrants. Aside from the letterhead mentioned above I am enclosing an article relating to the application of democratic principles in our own affairs, under heading \"Health Freedom Urged for Draftees,\" which I urge you to read and give careful thought. I believe that you agree in principle with the suggestions made in the article and I assure you that they are thoroughly practical in their application to men in the service of the United States. If Mr. Roosevelt would publicly and prior to the election urge the rights of the individual in the army to be no less than when they were in civil life in matters of such purely personal matters as the choice of health-aid measures upon which he has relied and in which he puts his faith as he did when in civilian role, it would swing 10,000,000 votes which he otherwise will not get. Mr. Wilkie is playing with organized political medicine and is receiving wide medical indorsement. I happen to be close enough to Christian Scientists and have observed their publications, C.S. monitor etc., to convince me that they are to a very great extent for Mr. Wilkie. If, however, the President should make a statement recommending that draftees be given the same options in matters of health that they enjoy as civilians it is my sincere belief that the Scientists would quickly swing behind him in the campaign. The Christian Scientists are very sincere in their beliefs in opposition to medical treatment or to any kind of treatment not based upon their particular beliefs. Then, there are millions of others who have beliefs of many and varied kinds as to such matters who are equally sincere, all of whom would support Mr. Roosevelt if it should come about that he favored health freedom for men in the service, especially draftees. The interest in this matter is very keen and widespread although it may not have come to your attention and, I am sure, the proposition would have no opposition from any source except political medicine. It only needs public approval by someone in a position to give force to its utterance in order to sweep the country and effectively silence some of the cries of \"dictator\" etc., which have gone up from the subversive forces of this country.I have complete faith in democracy and feel that, today, you and the President are the outstanding champions of its principles. Further, I believe that democracy works, or would, in all of our related activities if it were seriously undertaken. With every good wish and hoping to have the great pleasure and honor of meeting you in person when your responsibilities are not so great, and thanking you for anything you may do to promote the condition urged in the enclosed article, I am, Sincerely and cordially T.F.

Student Convocation, University of Nebraska spoke on \"Fads and Quackery in Healing\". After scoring George Star White, Messmer, Mary Baker Eddy, Lydia Pinkham, the W.C.T.U., Food Fadists, Advertising and Testimonials etc. said there were 36 forms of Divine Healing, 7000 Mental Healers, and that the two main forms of manipulative healing were Osteopathy and Chiropractic. He dwelt on manipulative treatment as depending on the power of \"laying on of hands, the power of advertising and the Psychology of testimonials. He told his usual \"Pole Cat\" story to illustrate his point of the U.S. having all the fakers and charletans. \"That Osteopathy was the means of getting into medicine by the back door, and that Chiropractic was the first three weeks of Osteopathy. He asked the question -- Do you know your own Senator from Nebraska introduced the bill in the U.S. Congress allowing Osteopaths to participate in the compensation act? \"Thank God, that the Army and Navy did not give Osteopaths and Chiropractors recognition. He also said that the introduction and passage of Basic Science Laws were controlling them to a certain extent. That in states where Basic Science Laws were operative, Chiropractors were being eliminated. That if students had to put in time to take Basic Science subjects that they might just as well take up the study of medicine. 1940 (Dec): National Chiropractic Journal (NCA) [9(12)] reports: -(p. 17): CHIROPRACTIC NEWS FROM JAPAN The following translation is made from Japanese to English by Uken Taniguchi, D.C., graduated from the LACC in April, 1928. Representation concerning Enactment of Law Governing Practitioners of Chiropractic. (Representation No. 150, introduced March 9, 1940.) The representation as herein above cited, was introduced in accordance with the provisions of law by Hon. Hiroshi Momiyama, formerly Parlimentary Councillor of the Navy; Hon. Rikich Sawada, Parlimentary the Department of Commerce and Industry; Hon. Yoshihei Fukazawa, an authority in this country in the manufacture of dairy products, and witht he support of thirty other M.P.'s. The representation reads as follows: 'For the purpose of promoting the health of the nation in as effective a manner as feasible, the Government should without further delay, provide for the enactment of a law governing physicians practicing Chiropractic treatment.' Hon. Saito, Chief of the Committee, announced that next in order was the representation requesting the enactment of a law governing the Art of Chirorpactic and its practitioners. Hon. Fukazawa, a prime-mover of this Representation, rose to urge the authorities to recognize the scientific nature of the theory and practice of Chiropractic. The Official Gazette, No. 3963, of March 25, 1940, announced that the representation concerning Enactment of Law governing the Chiropractic practitioners was passed by the Diet as reported bychairman of the Relative Committee - Taken from the July, 1940 issue of the Chirogram. -\"Captain Jamieson, if you please\" (p. 25): We have been advised that Dr. R.

The doctor was recently elected governor of District 20S Lions International, but has had to leave his practice to take command of the National Guard Battery which has recently been federalized in the interest of defense of the country. We would be interested in learning how many other chiropractors are in the ranks of the national defense forces at the present time. 1941: Paul Smallie DC later notes (Smallie, 1992): ...I heard the bugle blow....and it was beautiful\"; he asked the U.S. Army recruiters \"Where would it be calm and peaceful?

Since the war several Universities have been investigating the various therapies with the object of adding the group of therapies called Physical therapy to their Medical courses, and with the object of training students who already have a Bachelor of Science degree as Physical therapy technicians. I am sure that these colleges will include joint movements as a valuable part of their courses in Physical Medicine and Physical Therapy. 1941-1946: George Goodheart Jr. DC becomes Aviation Cadet, \"developed an innovative use of combat air amament and flew in aircraft of the Eighth and Ninth Air Force from 1941 to 1946.

As you are all aware, we have been trying since almost the outbreak of the war to get proper recognition in the Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps for the Osteopaths and chiropractors and those Physio-Therapists who are not a part of the Canadian Physio-Therapy Association, and up to the present time, without any success whatsoever. Upon the presentation of our case and the general outline of education to the Minister of Defence, he contacted Brig. Gorrseline and Brig. Chisholm and made appointments for us to see them and lay the facts before them. After considerable discussion with Brig. Gorrseline, Director General of Medical Services, he stated that the R.C.A.M.C. were anxious to get trained persons in their Non-Commissioned ranks, and recommended as follows:- 1.All persons, whether drafted or voluntary entering the Army, must take four months intensive basic training, (Brig. Gorrseline advised that this also includes Medical Practitioners as well as others, (perhaps this is taken with the C.O.T.C.)) and make application for assignment to the R.C.A.M.C. where, according to Brig. Gorrseline, the men will be given the opportunity of proving their worth, and if satisfactory, will be enabled to advance in the Non-Commissioned ranks to Sergeancy, with trade pay, which is 75 cents a day over the regular pay. 2.When accepted into the R.C.A.M.C. the men will then be sent to Camp Borden for special training in the various lines or positions in the R.C.A.M.C. for positions which should be open in one of the following branches:- Administrative - Clerks (Clerks should have training in short hand and typing). Medical Assistants - Trained in First Aid. Assistants to medical Officers of Units, Brigades, Districts and Hospital Units. Laboratory - Must have had special training in advanced laboratory work - this will also include X-ray technicians. Physio-Therapy - at the present time only women are being used in Physio-Therapy in the hospitals. Brig. Gorrseline stated that they are assured of plenty of these women for Hospital work and that at the present time no provision is made for Physio-Therapy in the Camp Hospitals, but it is quite possible that future demand may open opportunities for men in some branches or localities for Physio-Therapy work and thus enable you to carry on in your own capacity. Brigadier Chisholm, the Directorate of Personnel, requested your Representatives to secure as quickly as possible, after the date of enlistment, the name, address, date of enlistment, where enlisted, the assignment, and if possible the Regimental number assigned. In this regard, we would request that you complete the form enclosed herewith (this form is being sent to all Registrants up to the age of 45 years, whether eligible for the draft or not) and return immediately that you become enlisted. When you receive your Medical examination and appear before the Assistant Examiner (from the Department of Personnel) you should state to him that you wish to be assigned to the R.C.A.M.C., if this is your desire. He will make a note of this and the form which you have completed and returned to this office will be forwarded to the Directorate of Personnel at Ottawa, who will advise you, after approximately two months of intensive training, that you should be sent to Camp Borden for two months training in the R.C.A.M.C. as pointed out before in this letter. You will note that in the earlier portion of this letter, it was stated that after four months of intensivetraining you would be given the opportunity of R.C.A.M.C. training, this was the information as given by the Director-General of Medical Services, but the Directorate of Personnel stated that it would be at about the end of two months. It is now left in your hands if you are drafted or enlist, as to whether or not you wish to follow the procedure as set out herein, or wish to remain in the Combatant portion of the Army. While we have not by any means secured the rights and privileges which we believe you are entitled to, we do feel, however, that it is the opening of the door and that when those of you who enlist or are drafted have shown by your work that advancement into the Commissioned Ranks is your right and their duty to give you such promotion, you may rest assured that such assistance and pressure that the Board of Regents can bring to bear upon the powers that be, will certainly be done. While, as stated above, our accomplishment has not been what we had wished for, we do feel that we have at least secured some recognition and humbly pray that rapid advancement may follow and in the not too distant future, more from our ranks WILL BE REQUESTED. Yours very sincerely,... AWM/MR 1942 (Aug): Chirogram notes: Missing In Action in Midway Dr. R. William Stewart Word has reached us that Dr. Stewart is missing in action at sea. That makes us who knew him sad. \"Bill\" was a fine fellow, ever cheerful and helpful. His sunny disposition was a dominating characteristic of his personality. He enlisted in the Navy, October 1940, and was one of the first chiropractors to receive the rating of Ph.M 2/C as a starting rank. At the time of his absence he was serving on the U.S.S. Yorktown. 1942 (Oct): National Chiropractic Journal [11(10)] notes: -\"The Chiron Call\" by John W. Chapman (p. 29): Doctors of Chiropractic who serve the armed forces in the current war henceforth will be known as \"Chirons\" to the American Society of Military Chiropractors, an honorary organization founded last month by the National Chiropractic Association to serve the best interests of the profession's fighting men. According to the By-laws of the Amerian Society of Military Chiropractors, all servicemen chiropractors, regardless of their affiliation with the National Chiropractic Association, are entitled to honorary membership in the ASMC and all rights and privileges accruing thereto. There are no dues or any other charges involved in ASMC membership. Costs for all services to the organization will be borne by the National Chiropractic Association for the duration of the war. Attractive membership cards in three collors (see illustration at bottom of page) are being printed and will be mailed this month to those doctors who have been identirfied thus far in the Military Roll of Honor appearing monthly in the National Chiropractic Journal. Dr. Frank O. Logic, Director of Military Affairs for the National Chiropractic Association, urges individuals and state associations to regularly submit names of chiorpractors going into the army, navy, marine corps, air force or coast guard, in order that all doctors will be availed of the service extended by the American Society of Military Chiropractors. It is estimated that there are about 400 chiorpractors in the armed forces at the present time. However, official recognition of the Volunteer Chiropractic Corps, now numbering 700 doctors, and the inclusion of veterans of the last war would swell the ranks of the Chirons to well over 1,000 within the next few months. The name \"Chiron\" was selected as the title for ASMC members as a result of disclosures in the book, \"How Ancient Healing Governs Modern Therapeutics,\" which attest that Chiron the Centaur, ofThessaly, 32 centuries ago, was celebrated as a chiropractitioner of the utmost importance and fame. The name was used by Hippocrates to indicate the practitioner of the healing arts especially skilled in chirotechniq, or the art of treating human ailments by hand. The term has been carried into the masthead of an eight-page monthly newspaper - \"The Chiron Call\" - which will be sent to all members of the ASMC every month free of charge. With its front page devoted exclusively to news about chiropractors in the service, The Chiron Call will thus serve to introduce the Chirons to each other and create a spirit of comraderie among the ASMC. The rest of the paper will carry news of the profession, movie, radio and general features, including cartoons. Distribution of the first issue of the Chiron Call will be completed by the middle of this month. It will announce organization of the Amerian Society of Military Chiroprators and urge the Chirons to recount their service experiences in regular correspondence with the editor. That a service publication will be highly appreciated by our professionals in blue and khaki is indicated by the amount of mail which has been received by Dr. L.M. Rogers from army, navy and coast guard stations throughout the country. The \"Chirons\" are profuse in their thanks for the National Chiropractic Journal, which keeps them \"in touch with the home front,\" and several relate their experiences as members of medical units. Dr. Paul L. Hook, president of the Ohio State Chiropractic Society, writes with the title of pharmacists mate from Harsen's Island, Mich., where he is serving with the coast guard. Also a pharmacists mate (2d class) is Dr. Arthur M. Schierholz, formerly of Paullina, Iowa, who recently enlisted in the navy. From Dr. John I. Johnson, who is now a corporal serving with the 37th Evacuation Hospital, Ft. McClellan, Ala., comes word that he was fourth in a class of 97 in a surgical technique class at O'Reilly General Hospital. News concerning other doctors will be carried in this department every month. PHOTOGRAPH Reproduction of the membership card of the American Society of Military Chiropractors.

Cleveland, D.C. writes to T.F. Ratledge, D.C. to encourage him to collaborate on asking President Roosevelt to have the Armed Forces recognize chiropractic (Ratledge papers-CCCKC Archive) Dear Dr. Ratledge: Am enclosing, or rather sending under separate cover, an idea that I believe is of extreme national consequence and possibilities. It has already been officially adopted by Missouri, Kansas and South Dakota Associations including St. Louis' five factions who have not been able to get together on any other program since 1936. I believe it is a \"natural and the idea is close to the hearts of all Chiropractors about to be drafted and close to the hearts of all people who feel that their husbands, sons or sweethearts might need Chiropractic care. We have put it up to only three states so far and they have all adopted it enthusiastically. Personally I believe it is very valuable for schools to get active on. If it goes over, thousands will need to be trained at army expense, thousands now afraid to start in school will then start some to pospone the draft and for other reasons. The President by executive order can give us recognition, and considering his past attitude of finding the A.M.A. guilty of being a trust under the Antitrust Act (Sherman) his hatred of the monopoly of even the associated press etc., I believe that he will be most susceptible if we apply the pressure here at home. As someone has said \"It's the wheel that squeaks, that gets the grease.\" As I see it, this is a \"natural\" and the Ratledge College can become the natural rallying center of the west around which this movement can be built. Chiropractors everywhere are most enthusiastic and I feel that California Chiropractors would be also. Particularly is it of importance in those states like Texas that donot yet have recognition. With recognition by the United States Armed Forces, state recognition and recognitioin in state supported hospitals etc. would be inevitable. Am sending you a \"let's Appeal to Our President\" which puts the need of Chiropractic over, also two- page outline of rather complete directions and samples of petitions the President and to the Congress as well. I am anxiously awaiting your reaction as I feel that this ??? opportune and a NATURAL by which Chiropractic and your Institution may profit. Schools must not be unmindful of the possible U.S. ??? Chiropractic War trainees and post-war trainees. This movement ??? up most definitely with such future possibilities. I hope th??? the I.C.A. or something, we can get in on such gravy.

Yours truly,... 1943 (Mar): National Chiropractic Journal [12(3)] includes: CANADIAN ARMY SAYS NO CHIROS Canadian army authorities are not sympathetic towards the granting of Chiropractic attention to the armed services, according to Dr. J.N. Haldeman, Regina, who returned recently from Ottawa, where he had attended the first annual meeting of the Dominion Council of Canadian Chiropractors. A delegation headed by Dr. Walter Sturdy, Vancouver, conferred with Hon. J.L. Ralston, minister of national defense, and Brigadier Meakins, assistant director general of medical services. Following the interview, Dr. Haldeman said Dr. Sturdy and his delegation reported that \"chiropractors could not hope to be better than orderlies under the military medical organization. Hardly Recognized Brig. Meakins told the delegation, Dr. Haldeman said, that in the South African war, even dentists were hardly recognized, but that in the last war they made a large contribution, which was followed by the formation of a dental corps in this war.The idea was conveyed that in the next war chiropractors may have a separate classification,\" Dr. Haldeman said in his report on the interview with the brigadier and Col. Ralston. Dr. Haldeman said the chiropractors were despondent because this feeling on the part of military authorities would not allow them to enter the army in the post to which they were best suited. Instead, they had to enlist as combatants. This was particularly disappointing, the chiropractors stated, because the Dominion is short 300 doctors. In Russia, it was pointed out, chiropractors and medical doctors are placed on a par.

The gratitude expressed by chiropractors in the armed forces for this service of the National Chiropractic Association's American Society of Military Chiropractors makes us wish we could write a book to each one of them every day. But that's a project we can all work on a chapter at a time. The Kessler Field (Miss.) 'Wing Talk' recently devoted a couple of sticks of type to Dr. L.G. Harrison of Roanoke Rapids, N.C., who is a Volunteer Officer Candidate at that southern training base. Wing Talk said that Harrison may have thought he had left his profession behind him but such was not the case. The xtory related that 'Men from Bk. 15 come in from the obstacle course, long marches, or athletics and yell for 'Doc\". The paper noted that Harrison was president of both the Rotary Club in Roanoke Rapids and the eastern district of the Chiropractors' Society of North Carolina.

Dr. Nugent, as always, gave a most interesting talk on the subject of educational standards and instruction. Plans are being rapidly pushed towad the possible issuance of a publication by this Society to be called \"The Capital News.\" We believe here that by buying bonds and more bonds we can put up a good front for all fronts. - Submitted by Dr. Wm.

Dr. Nott has been made Chief of Staff of the Alamance Squadron of the Civil Air Patrol, which acts as a reserve for the regular Army Air Corps. This North Carolina Unit patrols as far as 60 miles out to sea and has effected many rescues since its operations began. Dr. Nott was successful recently in getting the Graham Kiwanis Club to endorse a legislative request for a $50,000 appropriation for the Civilian Air Patrol in North Carolina which should assure its passage. We salute Dr. Nott for his untiring activity. Mrs. Nott, member of the Board of Governors of the National Auxiliary,is doing her part too, by active work with the American Red Cross. -\"IT'S ON THE LEVEL\" by Chapman notes that: \"Sgt.

Olumpic Blvd, LA (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC): Dear Dr. Cleveland: Your letter of March 30, 1943, received in due time and glad to hear from you. Your observation concerning the \"weak petition\" by the N.C.A. is in exact accord with my opinion, and I consider it very unfortunate that we do not have competent representation at Washington, D.C. I feel that the profession should be represented there, and elsewhere, by men who can defend Chiropractic from attacks from any source or direction, and who have sufficient vision as to the scientific and philosophical applicability of Chiropractic to direct them in what they seek for the profession. If I had the money, I would most certainly be at Washington now, as the \"iron is hot\" now as it may never be again in the moulding of policies of the government concerning Chiropractic. We are sleeping on our opportunities, and it is indeed unfortunate. Your suggestion that we must do something concerning vocational training after the War has been noted. I would be glad to have your ideas upon what we should attempt specifically, and I would be glad to conduct some correspondence in the matter as Secretary of the Allied Chiropractic Educational Institutions. Until I received your letter, I did not know that Mr. Hollis was not attending your School or that he had returned to California. I note your letter to him, and will consider the matter of his attendance, should he present himself again, in accordance with the thoughts expressed at our Kansas City Conference of the Chiropractic Educational Institutions. Apparently your enrollment is not hurt as seriously as is ours. We have no idea of termination of the school work during the war, but it will be tough going if the war continues for too many years. With every good wish, and hoping to hear from you soon, I am, Yours very truly...

CLEVELAND: Recommendation No. 2 War Recognition. WHEREAS, the Chiropractic profession has offered the services of its members in the capacity for which our men have been trained in both World War No. 1 and World War No. 2; and such specialized professional services have been rejected on the grounds that not sufficient practitioners were available within the age limits qualifying them for War Service,THEREFORE, BE IT RECOMMENDED: That the Army follow their usual procedure as in cases where manpower in certain specialized services are necessary and desired; that being the training of additional men at Government expense. Recommendation No. 3. Rehabilitation. WHEREAS, At the close of World War No. 2 there will undoubtedly be many ex-service men who will request to study Chiropractic as a rehabilitation occupation, THEREFORE, BE IT RECOMMENDED: That all such request be allowed by the National Rehabilitation Committee without interference of choice of Chiropractic school or college, that being left entirely to the decision of the ex-service man or woman, himself or herself, Recommendation No. 4. NOW THEREFORE, be it recommended that in the interest of unity, the science and art of Chiropractic shall be considered to be the adjustment of vertebral subluxationsof the human spinal column. Recommendation No. 5. WHEREAS, The National Chiropractic Association and the International Chiropractors Association filed separately appeal briefs with the War Manpower Commission and did otherwise separately approach the Commission in efforts to secure recognition on the War Essential Activity List, and WHEREAS, Such Briefs and appeals to the War Manpower Commission were not one and the same and resulted in considerable confusion within the Commission and in the profession as to actual needs and desires, and WHEREAS, At other times different Government Agencies have been separately approached by the N.C.A. and I.C.A. on matters vital to the welfare of the profession, and WHEREAS, Such different approaches to Government Departments have not at times been in accord resulting in some confusion as the the desires of the profession and much controversy within the profession over the differences, and WHEREAS, The present emergency demands united action on the part of our profession if we are to properly meet the problems confronting us and attain our proper place in the field of healing arts and all differences and controversy must be eliminated so that such unity may be brought about, So, BE IT RECOMMENDED, that The Council of Chiropractic Schools, National and State Organizations, appeal to the National Chiropractic Association and the International Chiropractors Association to name a joint committee of the strongest men in each association and that such committee be charged with working out united appeals and approaches on all major problems and efforts of the profession for the duration of the present war emergency.

Miller of Floral Park, Long Island delegate said. At the initial meeting of the Women's Auxiliary, Mrs. Rae K. Mernick, Vice-President of the Metropolitan Unit, lecturing on \"Tolerance in the Healing Arts,\" asserted that the \"essential differences between the medical profession and the chiropractorsshould now be submerged in the interests of providing people o the home front with necessary health services.\" Mrs. Mernick also recommended a Board of Examiners composed of chiropractors to be set up by the State Education Department to pass on applicants for licenses, declaring \"any system of regulation which permits members of one healing branch to sit in judgment upon the qualifications of any other branch is unsound in principle and unworkable in practice.\" Resolutions passed included one memorializing the National Chiropractic Association to organize a group of post-war Chiropractic clinics for the care of war veterans afflicted with neuroses and nervous shock and one endorsing the Tolan Bill, now before the Federal Congress, which would provide for the inclusion of Chiropractic services under the U.S. Employees Compensation Act to Federal employees injured in the line of duty. Election of officers concluded the two-day meeting. Mrs. Ruth L.

McIntire, Surgeon General of the Navy will be of interest to all Chirons. DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY Bureau of Medicine and Surgery June 19, 1943 Washington, D.C. Hon. Karl Mundt, M.C. House of Representatives Washington, D.C. My dear Mr. Mundt: This will acknowledge receipt of your inquiry on June 14, 1943, relative to the service of chiropractors in the Hospital Corps of the United States Navy. There is enclosed herewith a pamphlet of information relative to the Hospital Corps. Under current recruiting procedure, a graduate or licensed chiropractor who is between the ages of 38 and 50 may be enlisted in Class V-6, U.S. Naval Reserve, up to the rating of Pharmacist Mate Second Class, provided he is physically, and in all other respects qualified for enlistment. If he can present satisfactory evidence of prior military or naval service, he may be considered for a higher rating. A chiropractor who is subject to the requirements of Selective Service may request induction for the Navy quota and assignment to the Hospital Corps. In this case, the man concerned is inducted as an apprentice seaman and must undergo a period of recruit training prior to assignment to professional duty. During this period he has an opportunity to present his professional qualifications to the Screening Board at the training station concerned in order to qualify for the Hospital Corps. If so assigned, he must undergo a further 30 day period of orientation in a Navy Hospital. Following completion of recruit training and Hospital Corps orientation, he will have an opportunity to qualify up to the rating of Pharmacist Mate Second Class.The minimum service requirement for advancement from the rating of Pharmacist Mate Second Class to Pharmacist Mate First Class is nine months. For further advancement to the rating of Chief Pharmacist Mate, the minimum requirement is two years, which period may be reduced to one year if on actual sea duty, on recommendation of the Commanding officer of the men concerned.

Tolan (p. 24) -A.C. Johnson DC, ND, serving in US Navy as Pharmacists Mate, First Class, authors \"Physiotherapy in the Navy\" (p. 24) After sixteen months as a Physiotherapy Technician and Instructor in the Hospital Corps of the U.S. Navy I believe I have gathered enough material from my training and experience to write a series of articles which will be of educational value to the profession. In the first two articles I will tell of my own personal experience and in the article sto follow I will outline the most up-to-date physiotherapy technique in the treatment of injuries, disabilities and diseases together with some true histories of actual cases. \"Upon my enlistment on November 19, 1942, I was given the rating of Pharmacists Mate Second class, (Eighteen years active practical experience), as physiotherapy technician. A chiropractor, Dr. Mitts of Torrence, California, without any physiotherapy training was given a Third Class rating at the same time. I was assigned to the U.S. Naval Hospital at San Diego, California. At that time there were twenty other chiropractors there most of whom I had known for years. All those who were given a rating of 2nd or 3rd class upon enlisting were required to take what was called a \"refresher course.\" The class was made up of Chiroprctors, Osteopaths, Pharmacists, Undertakers, Male Nurses, Optometrists, Chiropodists and X-ray and Laboratory Technicians. The course of instruction consisted of class work as well as practical hospital care of patients in the various wards. The class work covered the following subjects: Admission of Patients, The Care of Bed Cases, Administration of Drugs, Injections, Symptoms, and Abbreviations, Specimen and Diagnostic Tests, Therapeutic Treatments, Elimination - Enema, Lavage, Catheterization, Surgical Nursing, Blood Transfusions and Blood Plasma, Medical Nursing, Surgical Dressings, Communicable diseases and Physical Examination of patients. This was all covered in five weeks but with the practical work was good training. When not on duty I would watch some plastic surgery performed by the best surgeons in America. This was really marvelous work, molding a nose, ear or part of a chin by skin grafting, sewing in eyelids, skin grafting on burns, transforming hideous faces into fairly presentable faces. \"My next assignment was in the Physiotherapy department for duty treating patients and teaching physiotherapy to the hospital corpsmen. There were fourteen corpsmen, seven of whom were chiropractors and one a chiropodist. Five of the fourteen were qualified technicians, the rest were under instruction. The department was too small and although we had every type of modality there should have been more of each type for such a large hospital and to properly treat more patients needing this type of treatment. Weaveraged about two hundred and fifty treatments a day. The patients were all war casualties of every description, shrapnel woulds, burns, nerve and muscle injuries, paralysis, amputations, fractures, dislocations, sprains, infantile paralysis, skin diseases, etc. All of the students had compelted their regular eight weeks hospital corps training before starting the physiotherapy course. The Bureau of Medicine and Surgery issued in 1942, a curriculum for the training of these corpsmen. It calls for one hundred didactic lecture hours and six hundred and forty practical or clinical hours. The course is divided in mechanotherapy, hydrotherapy, light and electrotherapy and massage. Upon completion of the course, a certificate of Physiotherapy Technician is issued to those passing the required examinations. We had a good group of fellows and I enjoyed teaching them. After ten months as a Pharmacist's Mate, Second Class, I was now eligible to take my First Class examination. This consisted of a preliminary practical and oral examination, and for those who passed that, a written examination which was very stiff. The questions were mostly in Chemistry, Materia Medica, Pharmacy and Administrative procedures. Those who passed, truly earned their First Class rating. I made 3.8 - 4 being 100%. On September 1, 1942, I was chose to go to the Crile Clinic of Cleveland, Ohio, for a course in Advanced Physiotherapy. More about that in next article. 1944 (June 24): letter from TF Ratledge to Frank E. Dean DC of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic at 261 W. 71st St. in NYC (Ratledge papers, SFCR Archives): Dear Doctor Dean: Yours of June 20th. at hand and glad to hear from you. Also, thank you for the kindliness expressed in your letter. I recall something about some students who were formerly in your institution either enrolling here or at least talking about it, however, I do not remember details about them. I recall that a Mr. Richards from some school in N.Y. did start in to finish his course but when the war came on he discontinued the work. I believe that he was a native of Germany and perhaps had not completed citizenship in the U.S.A. At present I have no opening for additional instructor but, if Dr. Regardie does come out, have him get in touch with me and it might be that things would have changed by that time. Nothing is very certain these hectic days. I trust that your institution does not commit itself to the \"Baruch\" scheme to steal chiropractic by a failing medical click or in support of the bill now in congress which would place chiropractors in a service situation where they would be subject to medical control through the surgeon general's office. Either proposal is dangeraous and it is unfortunate that anyone, posing as representing the profession, should betray chiropractic by attempting to commit chiropractic to medicine or as any part of it. If Dr. Regardie ever expects to establish a practice there is no better opportunity than now in California. All the chiropractors are doing well, making money as they never did before. The only thing is, many of them are so anxious to make money that they sort of conduct a \"drugless department store\" office and let the patient decide what he needs instead of the Doctor making such decision and more and more people complain that they cannot get an adjustment any more. \"The chiropractors do everything else but give an adjustment\". I cannot understand why so many chiropractors have so little imagination that they cannot determine that the proper practice of chiropractic requires doing all of the things necessary in the complete application of the chiorpractic principles which are universally applicable in human health problems. With every good wish, I am, Very truly yours,1944 (July 10): letter from CS Cleveland to TF Ratledge, D.C. (Ratledge papers, SFCR): Dear Dr. Ratledge: In introducing Chiropractic Corp Bill H.R. 4533, Murphy and Nugent and the N.C.A. Board unless they are just stooges\" have shown their Intent and Purpose. They asked tht more than 99% of the Chiropractors of America be disqualified to serve as Chiropractors in the Armed Forces. They have overstepped. They have shown their real hand. A Program to Put the Schools out of business raised little objections. NOW they HAVE ASKED CONGRESS to disfranchise 99% of all Chiropractors. Fishbein would not have dared asked for as much, but Murphy and Nugent did. Let's Pull back the Curtain and tell the Chiropractors constantly that Murphy and Nugent asked Congress to disqualify them. Murphy and Nugent are in the Hot Seat NOW. In our opinion the folloiwng sheet puts them over the Fire. They have disqualified themselves for any right to lead. See that every Chiropractor in California and the West Coast gets this Sheet and Do It Now! There is nothing to lose and Everything to Gain. Reprint it there, cutting off bottom lines or we can print it here as it is already set up, if you wish. California Federated Chiropractic Ass'n or Ratledge College could send it out. You possibly need to contact the Chiropractors with some mailing piece. This would show that you were open, alert and active in the interest of Chiropractic and still available to receive their students. Sincerely, C.S. Cleveland P.S. With Murphy and Nugent and the N.C.A. leadership obviously betraying the profession, surely this would be the time to discredit such leadership in California and obtain members in your group. Use this if you wish. Alter if you see fit. Add to or anything but do it. Am investigating vocational training as suggested. 1944 (Aug): National Chiropractic Journal (14[8]) includes: -Maurice L. Hollod DC, Pharmacist's Mate, First Class and member of the ASMC authors \"Chiropractic and the war,\" notes AMA's hypocrisy in railing against \"dictatorships\" (pp. 17- 8) -Francis Regardie DC, a graduate of the Columbia Institute of Chiropractic and later faculty at LACC, member of ASMC, recounts his experience in the service in article, \"The status of chiropractic in the army\" (pp. 19-22, 48-9); notes his disgruntlement with the army's assignments involving many menial tasks, private chiropractic care for selected officers and their wives, ultimately advances to technical sergeant in charge of paperwork, repeatedly rejected for Officers Training presumably because of chiropractic background; notes (pp. 19- 22, 48, 49): On April 28, 1942, I enlisted for service in the Army. Immediately of course there were the shots and injections, of which the least said the better - save that I began adjusting my fellow soldiers at basic training camp more or less immediately, to alleviate the distressing gastric symptoms and cephalalgia which were the direct sequelae to typhoid-paratyphoic injections. My assignment was to be the medical department for basic training at Camp ____. Apart from regular basic military subjects, the curriculum included litter-drill, the rudiments of first aid, anatomy and physiology - with all of whcih the average well-informed chiropractor is familiar... And I have written this report, not out of personal rancour and dissatisfaction with my two year army career - though of course this is present and active - but primarily to expose as thoroughly as possible the utter hypocrisy and stupidity of the army attitude. So long as medical men are in authority, never will the chiropractor be given the opportunity to prove what he can do for the alleviation of sickness and suffering. The conclusion remains that we must fight, with determiantion and adamant purpose, primarily to educate the public to the absolute necessity of chiropractic, and by these meansforce the conservative, complacent and reactionary authorities to adopt an entirely different and rational attitude toward our skill. These past two years in the Army have proved utterly useless, bot to me as an individual, as well as to the Army itself. Registered in my mind remains indelibly but one thing - a vindictive impulse to fight this incompetence wherever encountered with every ounce of energy at my disposal, both as a writer and as a speaker. Prior to my enlistment I was one of those unfortunate chiropractors who was content with his own practice, but who left it to the other fellow to do the political and oratorical haranguing. I realized the necessity of cooperation with others with similar ideals, but.....! Today, my inner attitude has changed. For I propose working with the NCA wholeheartedly, as well as with the State Society in whatever State I happen to function, to aid them in every possible way to whip up chiropractic opinion and power to the requisite pitch, so that this present unholy and unrighteous condition of things may be eliminated from this democratic nation of ours. 1944: CO Watkins DC, immediate past chairman of the Board of Directors of the NCA, writes in his booklet, The Basic Principles of Chiropractic Government (Watkins, 1944, p. 17): Not long ago we received an appraisal of Chiropractic as a science from a high official in Washington. In a letter replying to a query concerning his position upon the acceptance of a Chiropractic Corps in the U.S. Army, J.A. Ulio, Adjutant General of the War Department had this to say: \"'The Surgeon General is charged with the preservation of the physical well-being of the military forces. This responsibility cannot be discharged in the absence of fixed standards governing preventive measures, diagnostic procedure, and curative therapy. These standards are only found in the schools of regular medicine and are based upon scientific fact and that precludes the integration of healers of schools founded on dogma or cult.' Here we find the distinction brought out between the regular and the irregular science. No doubt this was an advised opinion, though it could be the opinion of a prejudiced medical doctor. It could also be the studied opinion of any authority on science. As a matter of fact the statement is not true, but it is not difficult to understand why an investigator would arrive at such a conclusion. It is true that in the early part of chiropractic the public was bombarded with dogma in the name of chiropractic. Chiropractic organization and its leaders encouraged it. What was called chiropractic literature was filled with it. As a matter of fact an attempt was made recently to revitalize this dogma-spreading program on a nation-wide basis. Fortunately, it has been abandoned due to lack of interest and support on the part of the profession and criticism by some of its leaders. Since an organization is presumed to reflect the attitude of its membership, and literature is usually the best criterion of worth of a science, one is not surprised that the Adjutant General was advised that dogma was the basis of chiropractic practice. As a matter of fact, the average chiropractor bases his practice upon what has been proven in his practice and cares nothing for dogma. PHOTOGRAPH Herbert J.

Over three months after a formal declaration of an end to hostilities, the occupation is bogged down. Fanatical elements of the former Nazi regime who, in their zeal to liberate their nation from the foreign occupiers, call themselves members of the Werwolf (werewolves) continue to commit almost-daily acts of sabotage against Germany's already-ravaged infrastructure, and attack American troops. They have been laying road mines, poisoning food and water supplies, and setting various traps, often lethal, for the occupying forces. It's not difficult to find antagonism and anti-Americanism among the population--many complain of the deprivation and lack of security. There are thousands of homeless refugees, and humanitarian efforts seem confused and inadequate. In the wake of the budding disaster, some have called for more international participation in peacekeeping. A Red Cross official said that, \"...the German people will be more comfortable if their conquerors weren't now their overlords. It makes it difficult to argue that this wasn't an imperialistic war when the occupying troops in the western sector are exclusively American, British and French.\" The administration, of course, claims that, given the chaos of the recent war, such a situation is to be expected, and that things will improve with time. As to the suggestion to internationalize the occupying forces, the administration had no official comment, but an unofficial one was a repetition of the quote from General McAuliffe, when asked to surrender in last winter's Battle of the Bulge--\"Nuts.\" In an attempt to minimize the situation, a White House spokesman pointed out that the casualties were extremely light, and militarily inconsequential, particularly when compared to the loss rates prior to VE Day. Also, the attacks seem to be dying down with each passing month. But this statement was leaped upon by some as heartless, trivializing the deaths and injuries of young American men. Many critics back in Washington seem now to be prescient, with their previous warnings of just such an outcome a little over a year ago. One congressman said that \"...it's time to ask whether the German people are better off now than they were a few months ago. Yes, a brutal dictator has been deposed, but at least the electricity and water supply were mostly working, and the trains running on time. After years of killing them and destroying their infrastructure with American bombs, it seems to me that the German people have suffered enough without the chaos that our occupation, with its inadequate policing, is bringing.\" It's not clear how much support the Werwolf has among the populace, who may be afraid to speak their true minds, given the fearfully overwhelming \"Allied\" presence in the country. But it is possible that, like the guerilla forces themselves, the people have been inspired by Propaganda Minister Josef Goebbels' pre-victory broadcasts, and those of Radio Werwolf. \"God has given up the protection of the people . . . Satan has taken command.\" Goebbels broadcast last spring. \"We Werewolves consider it our supreme duty to kill, to kill and to kill, employing every cunning and wile in the darkness of the night, crawling, groping through towns and villages, like wolves, noiselessly, mysteriously.\" While no new broadcasts of Goebbels' voice have been heard since early May, no one can be certain as to whether he is alive or dead, and continuing to help orchestrate the attacks and boost morale among the forces for German liberation. As long as his fate, and more importantly, that of the former leader Adolf Hitler himself, remains unresolved, the prospects for pacifying the brutally conquered country may be dim. Although Grand-Admiral Donitz made a radio announcement of Hitler's brave death in battle to the beleaguered German people on the evening of May 1, some doubt the veracity of that statement, and there has been no evidence to support it, or any body identified as the former Fuehrer's. Rumors of his whereabouts continue to abound, including reported sightings as far away as South America, and many still believe that he is hiding with the \"Edelweiss\" organization, with thousands of Wehrmacht troops, in a mountain stronghold near the Swiss border. Many have criticized flawed intelligence for our failure to find him, causing some, in the runup to next year's congressional elections, to call for an investigation. A staffer of one prominent Senator said, \"For months, starting last fall, we were told by this administration that Hitler would make a last stand in a 'National Redoubt' in Bavaria. General Bradley diverted troops to the south and let the Russians take Berlin on the basis of this knowledge. But now we find out that there was no such place, and that Hitler was in Berlin all along. And now we're told that we can't even be sure of where he is, or whether he's alive or dead.\" For many, marching in the streets with signs of \"No Blood For Soviet Socialism,\" and \"It's All About The Coal,\" this merely confirmed that the administration had other agendas than its stated one, and that the war was unjustified and unjustifiable. General Bradley's staff has protested that this is an unfair criticism--that the strategic decision made by General Eisenhower was driven by many factors, of which Hitler's whereabouts was a minor one, but this hasn't silenced the critics, some of whom have bravely called for President Truman's impeachment, despite the fact that most of these decisions were made even before he became president in April. But some have taken the criticism further, and say that failure to get Hitler means a failed war itself. \"Sure, it's nice to have released all those people from the concentration camps, but we were told we were going to war against Hitler, even though he'd done nothing to us,\" argued one concerned anti-war Senator. \"Now they say that we have 'Victory in Europe,' but it seems to me that if they can't produce the man we supposedly went to war against, it's a pretty hollow victory. Without this man that they told us was such a great threat to America, how can even they claim that this war was justified?\" 1945 (Oct 24): letter from Fred J. Carver, D.C. of Wichita KS to John Nugent, D.C., NCA director of education (CCE Archives #35-23-1941): Doctor Nugent We are beginning to have requests from retuning Chiropractor Servicemen for personal training from me in my Monthly Refresher Courses. Will you please inform me how to proceed to do my part toward obtaining the Government assistance these boys are wanting. For your information, Carver Chiropractic College of Wichita was organized and Chartered by the State of Kansas in the year 1924. Before we got to going the other school here made some changes in their manner of teaching that met with the approval of the group and we have never accepted any full time students. What they wanted however, was personal training from me in the clinical department of regular Chiropractic College training. I have devoted a life time to this kind of instruction and am probably better equipped for it than any other person now living. What I mean by being equipped is the know-how of it. So all thru the years since that time have been teaching either post graduate classes or in some cases under-graduates who had already completed their clinical training in some Chiropractic College. Now I am teaching on a regular monthly schedule, starting another complete review of the subject at the firs of each month, thus making it possible for Chiropractors anywhere to come for post graduate training at whatever time of year they can best get away from their own practice. Carver Chiropractic College of Wichita is a non-profit corporation. The College has no building or equipment, no cost of operation and no income. I have kept the Charter active and have issued certificates of attendance under the name of the College, using the College Seal. I have been the only teacher, except for minor assistance from my office helpers. As far as I go I think that there is no better training available anywhere. The question is, how to present the matter properly to obtain Government assistance the returned Service man is entitled to, for a Chiropractic College that conducts only one department. Please inform me concerning this situation and also let me know if I am indebted to you for it and if so how much. Sincerely,... P.S. Perhaps to clarify the above I should say that in my office I have everything in the way of equipment that I need to properly teach and conduct my classes except for a few things that are unobtainable because of the war situation. Everything is considered my office equipment however and not College equipment. -handwritten note on letter indicates:Replied 11/14/45 Informing him only State Board or Department of Education have authority to approve 1945 (Nov 28): letter to Frank E. Dean, Dean of Columbia Institute of Chiropractic, from TF Ratledge (Ratledge papers, SFCR Archives) Dr. Frank E. Dean, Registrar Columbia Institute of Chiropractic 261 W. 71st Street New York, N.Y. Dear Doctor Dean: Your letter of November 19th received and read with much interest. Also with appreciation for your offer of $100.00 toward the legal expenses against the California Board. For your information will state that the Board has no right to change the law by wish expressed in rules or otherwise. I note with special interest your reference to the effect of Selective Service upon your enrollment and am sorry to know that it has interfered so seriously. Selective Service resulted in a similar situation with us until about the last year, during which time our enrollments have increased very decidedly until at the present time we are nearing a point where it will be necessary to increase our facilities. If I were you, I would give very serious consideration to the possibility that the 4000 hour requirements may have a very important influence in your lessened enrollment. It stands to reason that a prospective chiropractic student having been reared in medical environment as they all have and not understanding fully the scientific import of chiropractic education would feel that if they were to take up a profession that required 4000 hours, and since the study of medicine only requires 400 hours, they would prefer to study medicine instead of chiropractic. It is my sincere belief that chiropractic is not only standing in its own light, but is imposing upon chiropractic students, and most of all depriving the people who need chiropractic services of the health they might otherwise have in its childish attempt to copy after medicine in hour requirements for completion of a course in chiropractic.

Members of the profession were of the belief that a chiropractic corps was justified, and worked diligently towards its realization. Perhaps they were right. Certainly, we were discriminated against at every turn. And, certainly, no chiropractor should have been taken into the service as a buck private or a pharmacist mate third class, as many were. These doctors could have served their country to a better purpose had their knowledge and ability been utilized. It is my opinion, however, that a chiropractic corps could not have been successful. For the simple reason that the number of available doctors was completely inadequate. It is far better that the service was not available than to have been unable to cope with the demand for chiropractic treatments that would surely have arisen. As it is, the medical men who were responsible for the deletion of chiropractors, with their usual lack of interest in what would be the best for the people at large, may now be wondering about the advisability of their acts. For, with few exceptions, the returning doctors and students of chiropractic with whom I have talked have interesting tales to tell of chiropractic treatment having been administered to members of the armed forces - from G.I. Joe to General. And these \"boot-leg\" treatments did not help the prestige of the medical profession. My observation is that there is a deep and well deserved respect for the surgeon among the enlisted personnel, but that G.I. Joe knows that the medical profession was sorrowfully lacking when it came to the use of other forms of treatment. Many of the doctors and students of our profession did a lasting service to the profession through their contact with the enlisted man. Into every corner of the globe the chiropractic \"gospel\" was carried, many times at the expense of advancement in rating. To these men there should be some sort of special medal given. For they not only served their country well but held tight to their faith in their profession, to the end that its future is now even more secure. 1946 (June): JNCA [16(6)] includes: -Robert B.

He pointed out that of the forty-six states recognizing the practice of chiropractic, thirty-two states require four years of education for licensure; that of the remainder, ten states have basic science, medical or mixed examining boards whose examinations are of such a character as to require four years of education to qualify. The remaining four states, he warned, may quite likely raise their requirements while these students are still in school. Dr Nugent urged all students, particularly GI students, now enrolled in courses of less than four years to carefully consider the tragic predicament they may find themselves in later on when they attempt to qualify for licensure. He cited many incidents of disillusioned and embittered GI's, graduates of short courses, wandering from state to state futilely trying to obtain a license to practice.

(i.e., at Logan Basic College); includes an essay by Cash Asher entitled \"Can Chiropractic Survive as an Independent Art\" which is reprinted from the Truth Teller, June, 1945 (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC; in my Cooley folder): CAN CHIROPRACTIC SURVIVE AS AN INDEPENDENT ART by Cash Asher, 1507 West 12th St., Davenport, Iowa (Truth Teller, June, 1945) This question has been in the minds of thinking chiropractors for years. Generally speaking, those in the know, realize it cannot survive under present \"do-nothing\" policies and confused leadership. What, for example, has chiropractic achieved for itself during the war? It has been given additional gas and tires, and in isolated cases, politically active members have obtained new cars. These crumbs from the lean banquet table of war have been exploited by publicity- hungry adventurers as great accomplishments.War has shown the appalling weakness of chiropractic. Its members have served as bed-pan carriers in the armed forces. The government has welcomed them as hospital orderlies. A few have been deferred by draft boards after much sweating of blood. Not one has been commissioned as a chiropractor, or permitted to practise his art in the armed services. The profession never has been granted an essentiality rating. In this regard, it has been ranked miles below nurses and tradesmen of many kinds. Its schools have been depleted of students by draft boards. These educational institutions are now ports of entry for the aged and infirm - for the men and women who have relegated to the sidelines by age or infirmities. Chiropractic never has had a place in the war. It has no place in the rehabilitation program - except that invalided service men can attend some of its schools under the educational provisions of the G.I. Bill of Rights. It has no place in institutions for epileptics, or for the insane -- no place in the scores of veterans hospitals that dot the land. It has no place in public school health programs. It is like the dove that left the Ark and couldn't find a place to light. Yet its periodicals bristle with the pronouncements of great men who tell of the great things they are doing, and intend to do. For too many long years now, chiropractic has been riding the current of \"I Did It.\" Thos who pointed out the truth were blasted as \"Pessimists\" or \"calamity howlers.\" The editor of a leading Chiropractic magazine counseled me, in friendly fashion a few years ago, not to write anything pointing to the backwardness of chiropractic. \"The profession won't like it,\" he said. \"Give out with optimism if you want to be popular.\" This attitude reflected the chiropractic habit of side-tracking ralities and riding forward on a mythical train of illusion and hope. At a meeting of the highly-advertised organization of state boards, schools, etc., in Kansas City, a little more than a year ago, certain leaders decided against having any publicity, when the opportunity was there for plenty. They told the members, with an air of histrionic secrecy, that they were getting things done and that publicity would hinder their efforts. This wa hypocracy. Nothing was being done. It was self-aggrandizing dust sprinkled in the eyes of members, who were led to believe that the \"powers that be\" were silently laboring in their behalf. On one side in Chiropractic is the N.C.A. seeking to legalize the \"Chiropractic Physician,\" with the right to do anything outside of surgery and materia medica; on the other side is the I.C.A., made up largely and controlled entirely by H.I.O-ers. Coming in between now is a new organization - the American Consolidated Chiropractic Association. This group has a militant defense set-up headed by E.B. Simmons of San Antonio, Texas. Simmons stands alone in the field of chiropractic defense, having won the great majority of his cases. (We understand all). He is not well known nationally, but in Texas and adjoining states his reputation as a chiropractic attorney is sky-high. The organization conducts a public relations program along strictly chiropractic lines, but defends its members in the use of modalities and dietary practices. In leading roles are such figures as C. Sterling Cooley, Leo Spears (Dr. Spears assisted in writing the constitution but did not retain an office), Herbert E. Weiser and Vinton F. Logan. These men inspire confidence and give out hope, at least, that something constructive is in the making. Spears has contributed magnificently toward chiropractic progress although he has done it often with the hands of envy trying to hold him back. His hospital at Denver shadows all other like institutions in the profession. He has been a convincing propagandist and publicist, and has fouhgt many battles for the profession. Logan heads the Basic College of Chiropractic at St. Louis, and is well thought of everywhere; Cooley has been in the foreground for years, especially as president and executive board member of the N.C.A.; Weiser is with the Texas College of Chiropractic, and is regarded as highly by those who know him.It is my belief that these men have the brains and logic to lift chiropractic out of the doldrums where it has been for a decade. Sincere, sensible, non-fanatical, they may conceivably attract a sufficiently large following to carry out a constructive building program. I have been employed as public relations director of both the N.C.A. and I.C.A. I would have studied chiropractic had the policies of either organization offered the remotest possibility or hope of the profession surviving. Certainly the limitations of H.I.O. both technically and politically, rule out any hope in that field, while the ambitious, take-in-all dream of the N.C.A. is idealistic, to say the least - and most. So far as B.J. Palmer is concerned, his days of leadership have long since passed. He has made a great contribution to the development of the science, but today his following is limited to a handful of H.I.O-ers and G.P.C-ers. Most of the profession have turned thumbs down on him for good, and in the future he must be content for glory with his past achievements and the fact that he is the son of the founder. There is no hope of returning fame for him. Most of his chiorpractic tail-feathers have been plucked and he has retired largely into the field of his glamorous radio interests. He still functions as president of the I.C.A. That is his organization and he plays melodic tunes of the good-old days to its limited membership. Chiropractic has never learned to fight on the offensive. It has mastered defensive tactics, and, of course, has had to retreat and yield ground time and time again. The GPC - God, Chiropractic, Patient - philosophy, which lets the patient pay whatever his consicience dictates, is the final place of retreat for the profession. It represents a noble escape, a dignified resignation, an honorable retirement. It concludes, in typical East Indian fashion, that to fight is useless, and offers its services gratis, hopeing God will intervene and prod the conscience of patients to shell out the golden sheckels. The future of chiropractic as an independent science, hangs on a slender thread. Numberically it is weaker than it was twenty years ago. Legally it is caught on the flypaper of basic science laws and other purely medical enactments. It has failed for years to pass any Chiropractic laws. Whenever it has tried, the medical profession has intervened and added its burden to pending legislation. As a result, these enactments have come out of the hopper bearing the imprint of organized medicine. The chiropractic profession naturally wants to safeguard itself by licensing laws; but such laws almost unanimously embrace medical theory and philosophy. The new Association can win many friends if it will undertake a program that offers hope of relieving the ills that beset and irritate the profession. Among reforms that should be undertaken, we cite a few: Recognition by state compensation boards *** recognition by all insurance companies *** admission to practice in veterans hospitals and all state-financed healing institutions *** repeal of basic science laws *** revision of state licensing laws toward uniformity *** establishing pre-educational standards for the admission of students to colleges *** promotion of chiropractic hospitals. The hypocracy underlying many Chiropractic laws can be illustrated by the situaion in Missouri and Kansas, where 27 months time is required of a student. The Palmer School teaches enough hours in 18 months to meet the actual curricular requirement of these two states, yet students have to waste nine additional months to meet the basic 27 months standards. The Cleveland College in Kansas City has met the situation by teaching in 27 months what the student gets at the PSC in 18. The only hope of invalidating basic science laws appears to be through direct appeal to the people. The chiropractic profession lacks the numberical and financial strength and the political power to force Legislatures to repeal these medical enactments. The courts have upheld them in four states, and further efforts in this direction would be a waste of money. It has been my belief for a long time that chiropractors should stop dallying with courts and legislatures andcarry their problems direct to the voters. Basic Science could be repealed in any state by this method and at comparatively small expense. Most of the progress made by chiropractic has come through the success of individual practitioners in getting sick people well. That is why it has survived against the battering of many storms. But it cannot forever live on in measurable independence without unity and organization. Its enemies will crucify it by law. It needs the succor of constructive, long-range, militant programming - and this is what the new Association must give if it expects to avoid the death-house that is heaped high with the bones of past organizations. 1951 (Jan): The Record [3(1)] (\"Montly publication of Carver Chiropractic College\") includes: -reprinted notice from The Oklahoma Legionnaire for December 1950: \"G.I.

Although chiropractic physicians are licensed in forty-four states, Alaska and Hawaii, these medical men decided they were not necessary. The fact that chiropractors treat 30 million people annualy for some or all of their ailments was given no consideration whatsoever... During the last war powerful medical interests used every possible means to stop chiropractic. Schools of chiropractic were almost all forced to close and many of them actually were forced to close; those practitioners already in practice were drafted into the armed forces and forced to serve in capacities far below their qualifications and training. They were not even given college credits for their professional education. After world War II veterans' hospitals begged for chiropractic care, but because of those in charge of treatment at the V.A. hospitals, chiropractors were not allowed to treat these patients... 1951 (Feb): Journal of the NCA (21[2]) includes: -\"Selective Service considers deferment of chiropractic students; Representatives of National Chiropractic Association attend conference on draft policies by invitation\"; meeting called by Lewis B.

The arguments used in presenting our case to the different Senators and to General Hershey's office were presented in the form of a letter and two pamphlets entitled The Chiropractic Profession and Educational Standards for Chiropractic Colleges. The purpose was to give a complete picture of our profession; its history; development; practice; legal, social and economic status; and the level of our education and schools. These pamphlets proved very effective in Washington. They were prepared by me at the express request of General Hershey's Chief of Staff. It was my thought that you might find them not only interesting but valuable in many local circumstances. I am, therefore, sending these pamphlets to you under separate cover. The first thing that will strike the reader's eye is the adoption of the word \"chiropraxis\" as a noun instead of using the adjectival form \"chiropractic\". It is high time, I think, to stop being illiterate. We have been constantly embarrassed in our conferences and correpondence with federal bureaus and educational authorities who cannot understand why we use an adjective as a noun. I would suggest that all of us try to use the correct form of the word in our correspondence and speech and in time its usage will be generally accepted by the profession and the public. It will also be noted that I used a \"broad\" definition in describing the practice of chiorpractic in the pamphlet \"The Chiropractic Profession\". Aside from other considerations I was rather compelled to do this because the prime object of the pamphlet was to convince Selective Service and the Congress that chiropractors could fill the void left by the general medical practitioners called into Service. The Osteopaths were rated \"necessary men\" during the last war because they convinced Congress and Selective Service that they did obstetrics, surgery and general practice. We have not yet been able to convince anyone in Washington that a Chiropractic manipulist is a substitute for the general practitioner. Hence the broad definition of practice. As will be observed I have borrowed freely from other writers. Where a trite or nicely turned phrase expressed the exact meaning or color of an idea I used it gratefully. It is my hope that the Executive Board will authorize the printing of these pamphlets to supplement such publications as Chiropractic a Career etc. If that is to be done I shall want to change some of the subject matter and add a few more chapters to fit it for public consumption. Any suggestions along this line will be gratefully received. Cordially yours, J.J. Nugent, Director of Education 1951 (Aug): JNCA [21(8)] includes: -John J.

In the course of our conversation, he denounced vehemently the need for pre-professional training. The bias was so definitely indicated as to be far from amusing. It points up the line of demarcation in our profession on a national scale. The origin and history of chiropractic justifies some, if not most, of our weaknesses. The pioneers came from every walk of life. Most of them were sincerely interested in the sphere of helping others, but combined with a large bloc of opportunists and self-styled czars. Emotional balance is at a premium when considering the history of our first fifty years. What disappoints the writer is the fact that never did I dream that the younger element would capture, or if they did, retain, any of the old, stupid hatreds handed to them by a group of limited-thinking pseudo leaders. I am disappointed - to say the least! I believe that education (in the main) establishes balance and poise. It serves as a medium in developing logic in thinking. It gives direction. As time progresses, the need for a substantial background before entering the professional college will become more and more evident. I want my son to meet competition, when his time comes, withoutapology or deference. I want his background to be such that he can face the opposition with no inferiority or servility evident. This can only be the result of adequate and thorough preparation. It is axiomatic that unless one improves - and constantly - the forces of retrogression will take command. 1952 (May 8): letter to Carl Jr.on NAACSC stationery from Vinton Logan DC (Cleveland papers, CCC/KC): Dear Dr. Cleveland: Recently a letter from Selective Service found its way to our Association.

I feel that in order to have some degree of surety that our students have fair consideration, that we should request the following: For colleges that do not have one or two years of pre-Chiropractic training, (1)the student, in his last year of high school, must have been in the upper half of his class. (2)the student, in his first year of professional training, must be in the upper half of his class. This might be the answer to deferring our students from the draft.

The spring school terms mark the last enrollment opportunity under the Korean GI Bill for thousands of post-Korea veterans, the Veterans Administration said today. The reason, VA explained, is that the law's cut-off date of August 20, 1954, applies to Korean veterans separated from service before August 20, 1952. If they want GI training, they must begin by the 1954 deadline in order to continue afterwards. The deadline, however, comes before next fall's school term gets under way. Therefore, except for the summer session, the school term starting early in 1954 will offer many veterans their last opportunity to get started under the Korean GI Bill. Veterans who left service after August 20, 1952, need not concern themselves with the forthcoming 1954 cut-off date, VA said. Instead, they have two years from the date of their separation in which to begin GI training. Under the law, a veteran actually must \"enrolle in and begin\" training before his deadline, if he wants to go on with it afterwards. The mere filing of an application beforehand, with the intention of starting afterwards, is not enough, VA pointed out. Generally, the veteran will be expected to be in the classroom or at the training bench on his deadline date. Bus so long as he started in time, he may be permitted to interrupt his course because of thesummer vacation, or for other reasons beyond his control, or for any circumstances that VA deems to be excusable. VA emphasized that these cut-off date rules apply only to veterans training under the Korean GI Bill. They do not pertain to those enrolled under the original World War Two GI Bill. _____________________ *Note:The Summer Term at the National College of Chiropractic which begins on May 10, 1954, will enable the veteran to take advantage of his Korean Bill GI benefits. EDUCATION & TRAINING BENEFITS FOR KOREAN VETERANS Eligibility -- To be eligible, a veteran must be out of active service and must meet all these requirements: (1) he must have been discharged under conditions other than dishonorable; (2) he must have had active military duty some time between June 27, 1950, and the end of the current emergency (a date not yet set), and (3) he must have had at least 90 days total service, unless discharged sooner for an actual service-incurred disability. He may have served any place in the world -- in the United States or abroad -- and not necessarily in Korea. Length of Training -- Entitlement is limited to one and one-half days of education or training for each day spent in service on and after June 27, 1950, and prior to the end of the emergency period. The maximum is 36 months. Selection of a Program -- The purpose of the new GI Bill is to help a veteran obtain education or training to reach a definite, identified goal. The goal may be purely educational, such as obtaining a college degree, professional, such as becoming a lawyer, or vocational, such as training to be a steamfitter. Changing a Program -- It is most important for a veteran to give careful consideration to his choice of a training program under the new GI Bill, for under the law he may make only one change of program -- only one change and no more. Dates and Deadlines -- Although the new GI Bill is now in effect, no VA payments may be made for any period prior to August 20, 1952. A veteran now out of service has until August 20, 1954, to start training. Others, still in service, will have two years after discharge in which to begin. Education and Training Allowances -- A veteran in training may receive an education and training allowance each month from the Government, to cover part of his training expenses and living costs. Tuition, fees, books, supplies and equipment expenses will all have to come out of the monthly allowances; the Government will not pay for them separately. Rates for veterans in full-time training in schools and colleges are $110 a month, if they have no dependents; $135 if they have one dependent, and $160 if they have more than one dependent. Those in training less than full-time will receive lower monthly rates. How Allowances are Paid -- A veteran will get his monthly allowance sometime after the end of each month of training completed. Under the law, before VA can pay him, it must receive a certification from both the veteran and his school or training establishment, that he was actually taking his course during that period. SELECTIVE SERVICE REGULATIONS Requirements for Student Classification -- \"When considering the classifications of a registrant as a student the local board will just determine if he qualifies for a deferment under any of the various provisions of Section 1622-25 of the Selective Service Regulations.\" The provisions of Section 1622-25 that apply to students of the healing arts are found under sub-section (b)-(2) and (b)-(4).The provisions of sub-section (b)-(2) read, \"The registrant was (1) accepted on or before July 1, 1951 for admission by a professional school of medicine, dentristry, veterinary medicine, osteopathy, optometry, pharmacy, chiropractic or chiropody to the class next commencing, and, if such class has commenced, has entered such school, or (2) is a student in any such professional school to which he was admitted on or before July 1, 1951, and (3) the school at which he is in attendance has certified that he is satisfactorily pursuing a full-time course of instruction leading to his graduation.\" Students meeting any of the requirements of Section 1622-25 will be considered for deferment in Class II-S.

Henderson, of Mandan North Dakota, chairman of the NCA Council of State Delegates. Claude A. Henderson was born in Edgerton, Wisconsin, on March 12, 1897. The family moved to Mandan, N.D. in 1913, and he completed his high school education there, and then attended the Culver Military Academy, following which he served in World War I. He was married in 1919 and they have one son, who is married and living in Sacramento, Calif. He was graduated from the Palmer School late in 1920 and engaged in practice in Jamestown, N.D., for twenty-six years before moving to Mandan in 1946, where he continued the practice of his father, the late Dr. A.O. Henderson, who was a pioneer of North Dakota and assisted in obtaining the first chiropractic law in America in 1915, and served on the first board of chiropractic examiners in all capacities for many years. Dr. Henderson is now serving his third five-year term as a member of the State Board of Chiropractic Examiners in North Dakota. He is a past president of the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners and also past-president of the North Dakota Chiropractic Association. He is a member of all York Rite Bodies of Masonry, served as Commander of Knights Templar for N.D. in 1941-42, and served one term as representative to the Imperial Council of the Shrine. He is a member of the B.P.O.E., a director of the American Legion, and past president of the Lions Club. From the foregoing, it will be noted that Dr. Henderson has been extremely active in civic and fraternal organizations, in addition to his professional life. He is now beginning his thirty-fourth year of the active practice of his profession and has just this year purchased a large ground floor office building and remodeled it into one of the finest chiropractic clinics in N.D. He hopes to practice his beloved profession for another half-a-century, God willing. Dr. D.W. Lindgren, a recent graduate, is his assistant. Here, then, is another of our NCA members who has made a mark for himself in his own community as well as in his professional life.

Here is our problem: During the peak years of Veteran enrollment we were able to increase our College plant by adding a new building and to raise the standard of instruction to the highest level in the history of Carver College. As you know, the enrollment of veterans at the expense of the federal government has declined to a mere trickle. In order to maintain the standard of instruction which has been established it is of vital importance that our student procurement program be intensified sufficiently to maintain or, better yet, to increase the size of our student body. To solve this problem we need the counsel and advice of every Carver Graduate. Your ideas, your experience, your plans may be the very things that will get results for your alma mater. Doctor, Carver College is a non-profit educational corporation. It belongs to you just as much as it belongs to any one else. No one owns a nickel's worth more of it than you do. This is your problem as well as ours. Please come to the meeting in Wichita Falls on January 17th prepared to give us your most constructive counsel and advice on this problem. It will be appreciated by the trustees and other officers to whom you have intrusted [sic] the operation of the College. Let's make this the best Mid-Winter Alumni Meeting we have ever had.

Under Maine's Constitution, he is automatically succeeded by the president of the State Senate - Republican John H. Reed, 38, a well- to-do potato grower from Fort Fairfield. Mr. Reed said Gov. Clauson's death \"is terrible news for the whole State of Maine. He was a much beloved man and this is a great loss to the entire state.\" Gov. Clauson was the first Maine governor to die in office for almost forty years. Dr. Joseph R. Crawford said the cause of death was undetermined but \"in all likelihood it was heart or a cerebral hemorrhage.\" The governor was dead when Dr. Crawford arrived at Blain Hose, the executive mansion, at 2:35 a.m. The only member of the family present was Mrs. Clauson, the former Ellen Kelleher, of Waterville. The governor also leaves a son, Cornelius K., of Waterville, and a daughter, Mrs. William Shasse, of Brunswick. Gov. Clauson came to Maine as a young chiropractor. He settled in Waterville where he served as city treasurer in 1930 and mayor in 1956 and 1957. In recent years he had been in the oil distribution business there. Active in Democratic Party affairs for more than thirty years, he was United States Collector of internal revenue for Maine from 1943 to 1953.

Doloff, and went on to a victory over Republican ex-Governor Horace Hildreth. That was the last of Maine's traditional early September elections. In 1960, Maine will vote in November with the rest of the Nation. Gov. Clauson was the first governor elected to a four-year term.

Death occurred in a veterans' hospital, and burial was in Long Island. After graduating in medicine from the University of Athens and in chiropractic from the Palmer School, he became the pioneer chiropractor of Greece. Here he carried on his researches into early Greek medicine, culminating with the conviction that Hippocrates and other physicians of the time were the first to elaborate the principles of chiropractic and to apply them, a thesis which he sustained in his book How Ancient Healing Governs Modern Therapeutics. This book, published by G.P. Putnam's Sons in 1938, won him a permanent place in the history of modern chiropractic. His country of birth bestowed upon him high honors. The king awarded him the Cross of the Royal Order of Phoenix, and appointed him official chiropractor to His Majesty and the Greek Royal Family. - Submitted by C.W.

(in my Kimmel/CINY file): Dear Bill: I would like your opinion of the following proposition. Since the signing of the Federal Civil Rights Act, certain factors deserve our close scrutiny. Whereas the attorney Generals, in the past have prosecuted chiropractors for practicing medicine without a license, are not the tables now reversed. Le me explain. The Hayes Report on Chiropractic in California, has now become documented evidence of occupational discrimination against doctors of chiropractic, viz: unfair and unequal employment opportunities for the chiropractor in tax supported programs in institutions of public accommodation. Shouldn't we now utilize the same attorney generals to prosecute those violating the civil rights act by creating unequal employment opportunities in any of the technologies embodied in our courses of study or practice? Would it be possible for us to enter into suit, and legally fight for our rights in tax supported programs, as well as equal employment and/or use of institutions supported by public funds? By taking this kind of an aggressive stand, couldn't we become some kind of threat to the continuous support of Federal Aid tomedical education, on the basis that such support should be denied because of discrimination against the chiropractic profession? Wouldn't it be possible for the chiropractor to press for usage, study and participation within these tax supported institutions merely by application of the power given to him by this statutory privilege? It seems quite ironic that our schools have educated us well enough for us to enter into high income tax brackets, yet our schools receive no support from our tax money. Instead these monies are directed into \"medical monopoly's\" research to which we are denied participation. Wouldn't the alternative of \"support for our institutions or participation in those existing institutions,\" be rational? Further, discriminating action has occurred at the behest of the Veterans' Administration, who made Public Law 16 students sign affidavits that they would not practice chiropractic in New York State, despite the fact that the Federal Government was financing their education. This is occupational discrimination, isn't it? Sincerely,... EHK:co 1966 (May/June): Digest of D.C. authors \"World-Wide Reports\" (p. 12): AFTER TEN YEARS Secretary of Defense Robert S.

In a rushed weekend session, Congress passed the Defense Authorization Amendments of 1992 which contained legislative provisions that started out in the 102nd Congress as S.68 and H.R.608. Over the objections of the Bush Administration and in the face of active opposition from the uniformed services and organized medicine, both Houses of Congress included the commissioning provision in their versions of the broad Defense Authorization Bill. This legislation represents an important turning point in the history of recent relations between chiropractic and the Congress. Because of the grassroots lobbying undertaken by hundreds of DCs around the nation, by the time the legislation passed 86 members of the House of Representatives and 18 United States Senators, representing a broad bipartisan coalition had formally cosponsored the bill. Thanks to the insightful and dedicated leadership of Illinois Representative Lane Evans, who worked closely with the chiropractic grassroots effort, the ICA staff and other organizations, this legislation was successfully steered through the legislative process in the House. Progress in the House gave important impetus to the companion legislative effort in the Senate. All of chiropractic owes Representative Evans a sincere debt of gratitude for his efforts on this bill. ICA is organizing a task force to assist the Department of Defense in recruitment of DCs to serve as commissioned health care officers and to assist in the integration of chiropractic science and practice in the military health care system. 1992 (Nov 20): Dynamic Chiropractic (10[24]:1) reports: President Bush Signs Commissioning Bill DOD Not Expected to Act On Friday, October 23, 1992, President Bush signed the Defense Authorization Bill (HR 5006). Section 505 of that bill authorizes the Secretary of Defense to \"appoint chiropractors as commissioned officers in the armed forces to provide chiropractic care within the military health care system. The long battle to get legislation passed that allows for commissioned officer status for DCs is a tribute to the perseverance and tenacity of the chiropractic profession. The struggle to overcome the discrimination inherent in the military's policy toward chiropractic, however, is far from over. Section 505 only authorizes the appointment of DCs as commissioned officer; it doesn't mandate the military to act. In the Navy Times, we read first hand the military's opinion of section 505: 'The Defense Department has no intention of commissioning chiropractors. At a time of tight budgets, health care officials believe the treatment a chiropractor can offer is unnecessary. Expect chiropractic to lobby Congress in 1993 to force a change. The Navy Times got one thing right: expect chiropractic to force a change. 1995 (Mar): Journal of the ACA Mazzarelli, D.C.\" (p. 90): After undergoing a second bypass heart surgery and enduring an extended illness, Joseph P. Mazzarelli Sr., D.C. passed away on January 6, 1995. Dr. Mazzarelli was a noted member and past president of the ICA and made many contributions to that association and the profession. Dr. Mazzarelli was a graduate of Palmer School of Chiropractic, where he served as a member of the board of trustees since 1975. He was a key proponent of the transformation of Northern CaliforniaCollege of Chiropractic to Palmer College of Chiropractic West. Dr. Mazzarelli served as chairman of the board of PCCW. While recovering from a bout of malaria while stationed in the Caribbean during World War II, Dr. Mazzarelli received his first chiropractic adjustment. After the war, he made chiropractic his profession, and began a private practice, first in Camden, N.J. and later in Pennsauken. During his career he served as president of both the New Jersey and South Jersey Chiropractic Societies, and received numerous honors, including honorary degrees from Palmer, Palmer West and Columbia College [sic] of Chiropractic. Dr. Mazzarelli is survived by his wife, Ann, his daughter Jo Ann Heidenreich, of Nashville, Tenn., and two sons, Dr. Joseph Mazzarelli, Jr., of Cinnaminson, N.J., and Dr. Frank Mazzarelli of Tampa, Florida. 1995 (June): Chiropractic History [15(1)] includes: -\"World War II anniversary a chiro research challenge\" (p. 52): The Chiropractic Centennial occupies most of the reflections of members of the profession this year, but or much of the world the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II has also been an occasion for looking back. In that watershed year the profession was poised for a resurgence that it could not have anticipated: the war years had depleted the student populations - and faculties - of its schools, but legislation which was enacted in 1944 and in January 1945 became the basis of a revival of the schools similar to the period after World War I. The \"GI Bill\" paid for hundreds - perhaps a few thousand - returning veterans to gain a chiropractic education. The American Society of Military Chiropractors during the war years had published a \"Military Roll of Honor\" for those \"chirons\" who served as both officers and enlisted personnel, in all branches and in all theaters of conflict. Some of the data remains to be found: how many went into the services, how many received their DC through the GI Bill, how many \"GIs\" entered practice and how many made the final sacrifice. This page from the August 1942 Chirogram, the journal of the Los Angeles College of Chiropractic is a reminder of that sacrifice: Missing In Action In Midway Dr. R. William Stewart Word has reached us that Dr. Stewart is missing in action at sea. That makes us who knew him sad. \"Bill\" was a fine fellow, ever cheerful and helpful. His sunny disposition was a dominating characteristic of his personality. He enlisted in the Navy, October 1940, and was one of the first chiropractors to receive the rating of Ph.M. 2/C as a starting rank. At the time of his absence he was serving on the U.S.S. Yorktown. 1995 (Nov): Journal of photo: Dr. Galen Price, the fourth President of Palmer College of Chiropractic and a former secretary/treasurer of the International Chiropractors Association, died on Monday, January 17, 2000, in Lakeland, Florida. He was the first president of Palmer College who was not a member of the Palmer family, succeeding to the presidency upon the death of Dr. David Palmer in 1978. Remembering Dr. Price, the current President of the College, Dr. Guy Riekeman, offered the follow: If you plant for a year, you plant corn. If you plant for a century, you plant a treeIf you plant for a millennium, you plant ideas and educate students. -Anonymous \"Galen Price changed the world by planting ideas in generation after generation of chiropractic students. He taught my father, he taught me, he taught the profession. He was kind and gentle, witty and caring, strong in principle; a colleague, a mentor, a friend. The world and our profession have lost an irreplaceable gem; today we will mourn, tomorrow we will celebrate, but for all time let's not forget the gift he gave - the gift that was his life,\" said Dr. Guy Riekeman. Born on March 25, 1912, Galen Price was a native of Lamed, Kansas. He attended Clark University in Massachusetts and graduated from Palmer School of Chiropractic in 1936. He was a veteran of World War II, having served as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the South Pacific from 1941 to 1944. Dr. Price served at the College as Dean of Faculty, Chairman of the Department of Chiropractic Sciences and Dean of Philosophy. He was named Chairman of the Administrative Executive Committee in 1976 and Administrator of the College in 1977. Although contemplating retirement, he agreed to serve as President so that the Board of Trustees could conduct a thorough search for the next President. He served till 1979. Dr. Price was ICA's Secretary/Treasurer during the 1961-1964 term of ICA President Dr. John Q. Thaxton. Throughout the 1960's Dr. Price was an active member of the ICA Review editorial board, and a member of the ICA Board of Control. ICA elected him a Distinguished Fellow of the ICA in 1961, and honored him in 1977 with the coveted \"Chiropractor of the Year\" award. And just last year, ICA presented Dr. Price with the prestigious Herbert Ross Reaver Award for a lifetime of dedicated service to the chiropractic profession. Among his many other honors were an honorary Doctor of Chiropractic Humanities from Palmer in 1968, being named a Fellow in the Palmer Academy of Chiropractic in 1990, and \"Mr. Philosophy of Chiropractic\" in 1973 from the Palmer Student Council. Survivors include his wife, Dr. Lorene Price, and sons Galen Jr., David, Charles and George, and daughters Patricia and Mary Lorene.

Date:10/5/00 4:34:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time From:AOL News BCC:ShermanRPS ACA: Lawmakers Criticize Veterans Affairs Witnesses On Inadequate Chiropractic Policy Medical Lobby Assails Efforts to Expand Access To Chiropractic Care WASHINGTON, Oct. 5 /PRNewswire/ -- The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) and other chiropractic groups testified in favor of direct access to chiropractic and full scope of services for veterans Tuesday during a hearing before the House Committee on Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health. During the hearing, congressional lawmakers sharply criticized officials from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for that agency's failure to take aggressive action to ensure that veterans are provided with chiropractic care. \"Congress, as early as 1978, authorized VA to provide chiropractic services to eligible veterans,\" Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-FL), subcommittee chairman, said during the hearing on chiropractic services in the VA. \"But over the period of its existence, VA has never employed its first chiropractor as a VA staff practitioner in this professional field; has never developed, without prodding fromCongress, any meaningful policy on chiropractic care; and until this hearing, has never had to defend its decisions to severely restrict or deny chiropractic care to veterans. \"In this member's opinion,\" Stearns continued, \"if a health care service is licensed and fully legitimate in all 50 states and abroad, if millions of Americans are willingly paying for this service every day, if health insurers -- and even the federal Medicare program -- approve reimbursements for the service as a routine activity of doing business ... then VA needs to better articulate why VA seems to deny these services to eligible veterans.\" Stearns' comments were echoed by other members of the committee who were present at the hearing, including Representatives Bob Filner (D-CA) and Luis Gutierrez (D-IL). While the VA was harshly criticized by members of Congress, prominent medical organizations, including the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA) attempted to block efforts by the ACA and other chiropractic groups that were pushing for legislation that would mandate access to chiropractic on a \"direct access\" and \"full scope of practice\" basis. In response, the ACA and other chiropractic groups pointed out that chiropractic adjustments have been proven effective for the nation's military personnel. Reports from the Department of Defense Chiropractic Health Care Demonstration Project (CHCDP), recently completed at military treatment facilities across the country, show that chiropractic care not only reduced disability and improved patient satisfaction, but also could potentially save 199,000 work days per year for the DOD. \"I believe the benefits of chiropractic care will continue to be proven with the addition of chiropractic services in the military health care system,\" said ACA representative Rick McMichael, DC, a member of the CHCDP Oversight Committee. \"It should be noted that doctors of chiropractic are licensed and regulated in all 50 states as independently practicing health care professionals,\" Dr. McMichael continued. \"All of these jurisdictions recognize chiropractors' rights and responsibilities to serve as first- contact, portal-of-entry providers. As such, doctors of chiropractic possess the diagnostic skills necessary to differentiate health conditions that are amenable to their management from those conditions that require referral or co-management with another professional.\" Dr. McMichael pointed to the extensive academic and clinical training doctors of chiropractic receive through accredited chiropractic colleges across the country - training that includes the use of diagnostics and therapeutics. Also testifying on behalf of the chiropractic profession were representatives of the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC) and the International Chiropractors Association (ICA). The hearing came just days after an amendment regarding chiropractic care for veterans prepared by staff of the House Veterans Affairs Committee and due to be inserted in legislation pending before the full U.S. House of Representatives was dropped from inclusion in the overall measure after the ACA and other groups rejected the staff-authored proposal as being woefully \"inadequate.\" Preparation of the congressional staff-authored proposal came after the ACA, ACC and ICA urged the House Veterans Affairs Committee to include a \"full scope and direct access\" chiropractic provision in H.R. 5109 (the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Personnel Act of 2000) when that bill was \"marked-up\" by the House VA Committee on September 13. At the committee's mark-up session, several members of the committee indicated their support for including a chiropractic-related amendment in the bill -- provided acceptable legislative language could be agreed upon -- prior to a vote on the measure by the full House of Representatives. The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) is the largest chiropractic organization in the country, representing nearly 20,000 members. Chiropractic is the third largest doctoral-level health care profession in the western world after medicine and dentistry. In the United States, the governments of all states license and regulatedoctors of chiropractic as independently practicing health care professionals. The major treatment applied by doctors of chiropractic is spinal adjustment or manipulation to correct a subluxation. 2000 (Oct 31): e-mail news received: President Clinton Signs Into Law Permanent Chiropractic Benefit for Military WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 /PRNewswire/ -- Culminating nearly a decade of joint lobbying efforts by the American Chiropractic Association (ACA) and the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC), President Bill Clinton yesterday signed into law historic legislation mandating that chiropractic care be made available to all active duty personnel in the United States armed forces. ACA Chairman Dr. J. Michael Flynn called the signing of the law the biggest chiropractic legislative victory in 26 years. \"A whole new health care system -- one of the largest in the nation -- will now be opened up to the chiropractic profession. For the first time, all active duty military personnel will be guaranteed access to a permanent chiropractic benefit,\" Dr. Flynn stated. \"Most importantly, we have achieved inclusion on a broad scope basis, and have successfully avoided a very narrow, Medicare-like benefit,\" Dr. Flynn added. The law, formally known as the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, requires access to chiropractic services \"which includes, at a minimum, care for neuromusculoskeletal conditions typical among military personnel on active duty.\" According to ACA officials, passage of the legislation required years of effort and occurred despite powerful opposition by the Department of Defense (DoD) and various medical groups. \"This was a difficult and protracted battle,\" said Dr. James A. Mertz, president of the ACA. \"We had to fight a hostile and entrenched bureaucracy every step of the way. The key to this victory was persistence and hard work. The ACA and ACC kept pressing Congress on the issue. We simply refused to give up,\" said Dr. Mertz. The law requires that full implementation of the benefit be phased in over a five-year period, throughout all three service branches of the military. When completed, all active duty personnel stationed in the United States and overseas are to have access to the chiropractic benefit. The law further requires the DoD to develop, by March of 2001, a full \"implementation plan\" to ensure the benefit is adequately provided. ACA and ACC also fought for -- and won -- a provision within the law requiring that DoD consult with the chiropractic representatives serving on the Chiropractic Health Care Demonstration Project's (CHCDP) Oversight Advisory Committee regarding the development and implementation of the phase-in plan. According to ACA officials, the president's signing of the legislation could result in the commissioning of doctors of chiropractic as officers in the military.

Dr. Floyd Miller received a commission at the rank of Captain (03), as a chiropractor, on July 23, 2001 in the New York National Guard. Dr. Miller served in the Air Force in 1974 and worked as a weapons control system mechanic on F-4's. In 1983, Dr. Miller took advantage of the GI Bill to attend chiropractic college. Please join the ACA in congratulating Dr. Miller on his commission. Late breaking news: Dr Miller has just been placed on Active Duty.2002 (Jan 26): e-mail news: President Bush Signs Historic Chiropractic Veterans Legislation Into Law ARLINGTON, Va., Jan. 24 /PRNewswire/ -- President Bush signed legislation late last night mandating the establishment of a permanent chiropractic benefit within the Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) health care system. The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) is hailing the new law (Public Law 107-135) as not only an enormous triumph for the profession but also proof of the powerful role chiropractic plays on Capitol Hill and in the nation's health care system. \"This profession has been fighting to make this law a reality for 65 years. It is just tremendous to finally see it happen,\" said ACA Chairman James Edwards, DC. The law, called the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Programs Enhancement Act of 2001 (H.R. 3447), had been passed by the Senate during one of the last actions of the 107th Congress before its adjournment for the year. The law authorizes the hiring of doctors of chiropractic in the DVA health system, sets a broad scope of chiropractic practice, and allows the chiropractic profession to oversee the development and implementation of the new benefit through an \"advisory committee,\" partially composed of representatives of the chiropractic profession. The agreement is similar to legislative language that became law last year requiring the Department of Defense to establish a permanent chiropractic benefit for active duty military personnel. \"The passage of this historic law represents an enormous victory for America's veterans, who will now have access to the chiropractic care they have been denied for far too long,\" said ACA President Daryl D. Wills, DC. \"But this tremendous win is also a sweet victory for the chiropractic profession, because we faced such an uphill battle to see it through.\" Joining the ACA in support of the legislation were the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC), the International Chiropractors Association (ICA) and the World Chiropractic Alliance (WCA). The measure was championed by a strong bi-partisan coalition led by Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle (D-SD), House Veterans Committee Chairman Chris Smith (R-NJ), Congressmen Jerry Moran (R-KS), Lane Evans (D-IL) and Bob Filner (D-CA), Senator Strom Thurmond (R-SC) and Senator Tim Hutchinson (R-AR). Governor Bob Wise of West Virginia was also instrumental in lobbying for support of the legislation. Key provisions of the new law include: * Immediate phase-in of the program. * Designation of at least one DVA medical center in each geographic service area of the Veterans Health Administration to provide chiropractic services. The designated sites will be medical centers and clinics located in urban and rural areas. * Scope of chiropractic services that \"shall include a variety of chiropractic care and services for neuromusculoskeletal conditions, including subluxation complex.\" * Dissemination of educational materials on chiropractic to primary care teams \"for the purpose of familiarizing such providers with the benefits of chiropractic care and services.\" * Establishment of a chiropractic advisory committee that will advise the Secretary on protocols governing referral to doctors of chiropractic, direct access to chiropractic care, scope of chiropractic and other issues. The chiropractic profession's task will now be to ensure that the DVA properly and expeditiously moves forward to implement this law. The ACA will carefully monitor the implementation of this new benefit, and will provide updates as events warrant. 2002 (Jan 29): e-mail news: Bush Signs Vet Benefit Into LawWASHINGTON, DC (Chiro Wire) It's official: The nation's veterans will now have access to a broader range of chiropractic benefits, thanks to legislation OK'd by President Bush last week. Hailed by the American Chiropractic Association as an \"enormous triumph for the profession,\" the law authorizes the Department of Veterans Affairs health care system to hire doctors of chiropractic, sets a broad scope of practice for DCs and establishes an advisory committee, including chiropractic representatives, to oversee the development and implementation of the new benefit. The victory follows an \"uphill battle,\" according to ACA President Daryl Wills. The organization faced opposition from the American Physical Therapy Association, which argued that expanded chiropractic benefits would divert funding from physical therapy services. Both groups say they support the version signed into law, which scales back some measures proposed in earlier versions. 2002 (Apr): JACA [39(4)] includes: 6-7) concerning passage of chirobenefits for vets: Late in the evening of Jan. 23, President George W.

CHIROPRACTIC HISTORIAN CHRONICLES STRUGGLES IN VA AND DOD Joe Keating, Phd, a well-known chiropractic historian, read my report two weeks ago regarding the American Legion and its support for the chiropractic benefit for veterans. He thought that you and I might be interested in a chronology he put together regarding chiropractic in the military and the treatment of veterans stretching from World War I through the Korean conflict. The Chronology of Chiropractors in the Military and Veterans Affairs is jam packed with great stories documenting our struggle with the military and veterans' bureaucracy. I have provided below the link to this report, which printed out is 30-plus pages long. Included in the document is the discussion about our efforts as early as World War I to be part of the Military Health Corps, and in 1925 the efforts to lobby Congress to make chiropractic a permanent benefit in the Veterans Administration. There are numerous pictures sprinkled throughout the document, including a 1941 photo of Eleanor Roosevelt with Congressman John Tolan and Dr. Emmett Murphy, NCA Washington Representative; our doctors in combat zones; supporting the war bond efforts; and the official membership card for doctors in the military with the special name of \"Chiros.\" If you are at all interested in the history of chiropractic, this is a great document to review. If you have any similar stories that you wish to share with Dr. Keating, please forward them to him at JCKEATING@aol.com. He is thinking about writing a comprehensive history of chiropractic during World War II. One final note: Reading about our early struggles in getting into the military and lobbying Congress regarding the Veterans Administration and the DOD makes me that much prouder about what we have accomplished the last two years. I know that without the efforts of the doctors in the 20s, 30s and 40s, we would not have had the successes that we have recently enjoyed.Here is the link to this report: http://www.acatoday.com/pdf/VetHistory.pdf 2002 (May 14): e-mail from Jim Winterstein DACBR (jwinterstein@nuhs.edu): Thanks Joe. Another bit of trivia - I was the first radiology resident (in an ABCR approved residency) to have the GI Bill pay for the residency.At the time I was at National, many veterans had gone through the DC program on the GI Bill, but there had been no residency program prior to that at National (there was one at Lincoln and another at LACC) that was approved by the ABCR for purposes of writing the diplomate exam in radiology. Like Lincoln and LACC, National had a program and had one person in it but it still required the so-called resident to take the weekend course before sitting for the exam. The residency program submitted in 1966 by Leonard Richie (National's roentgenologist) was finally approved at a meeting in Indianapolis and Don Tomkins, Charles Tasharski and I were the first residents to be a part of this program which encompassed no fewer than 4400 hours of post-professional study. In 1970, Don and I wrote the diplomate board along with three of the residents from Lincoln and LACC, who had taken the weekend course. Our examiners included Leo Wunch, Joe Howe, Douglas Ray, Mike Giammarino, Don Hariman and Earl Swallen. Don and I passed and became the first completely residency trained diplomates of the American Chiropractic Board of Radiology on June 1, 1970. Charles Tasharski never wrote the board and Don unfortunately died in 1980 of leukemia. Following our success at the board, Don and I were made co-chairs of radiology, and in 1971 when Don left National to go to the Ortman Clinic to establish their first radiology center, I became the chair of radiology. My first residents included Adolph Bucher from Switzerland who dropped out, Leo Kelzo who did not complete the program, Terry Yochum, David Taylor (who never took the board) Larry Pizek, who is a diplomate, and Ray Conley who is a diplomate. Reed Phillips began his residency when I was still in the department, but had relinquished the chair to Joe Howe since I was then in full time practice (sometime in 1972). I finished my first stint at National on November 1 of 1973 and moved to Florida to practice. Actually a long way of telling you that I think I was the first chiropractic resident to receive G I Bill money for a residency program. Jim 2002 (Oct 7): e-mail forwarded: Subj: The Army and Chiropractic Date: All I have received some disturbing information about the US Army's implementation of the chiropractic benefit. It appears that what I had previously dismissed as unorganized, passive-aggressive behavior may be an organized attempt to undermine chiropractic access. I have received two documents; one is a letter from the Assistant Surgeon General of the Army, albeit an unsigned copy; the other is apparently a guideline for PCMs to help them to \"understand\" when to refer to chiropractors. The letter from the Assistant Surgeon General, which I will cut and paste to the bottom of this page, limits the initial course of chiropractic care to six visits. This then would be followed up by a re-evaluation of the PCP. Please take a moment and read the attached letter. Much more disturbing than the ASG's letter are the guidelines regarding chiropractic. These are very slanted and injurious to chiropractic implementation in the Army. I do not have these guidelines stored electronically, but I will share some of the highlights below. If you would like me to fax you copies please send me your fax number.These guidelines had an exhaustive list of contraindications that included: SLR, disc herniation, tendonapathy, spondyloarthropathy, neurologic deficit, ligament injures... The only indication that they gave for manipulation was for the treatment of lower back pain of less than three weeks duration. These guidelines recommended that NSAIDs be tried before a chiropractic referral. In addition to this list of contraindications is the following section: Manipulation Disadvantages Basic science documentation of the physiologic and biomechanical basis and effects of manipulation therapy is lacking. Manipulation therapy is ineffective for chronic back pain Some studies show that maintenance visits are necessary to sustain the effects of manipulation therapy. This increases the cost of the care and fosters patient dependence. Serious complications, although rare, have been documented. These include acute disc herniations, cauda equina syndrome, vertebral basilar insufficiency, fractures and spinal cord injury. A report of 135 complications from manipulation therapy included 18 deaths and 52 permanent neurological injuries. Most of the complications involved cervical spine manipulation and were attributed to poor technique and /or inadequate evaluation prior to manipulation. Under a section entitled Indications for Chiropractic Referral the following paragraph exists: \"The chiropractor is a consultant for manipulation therapy. He/she is not a \"musculoskeletal primary care provider\". The primary care provider should not transfer all control of the patient to the chiropractor. The patient should have follow up visits with primary care during and after the course of manipulation therapy. The primary care provider should assess the results of manipulation, order additional therapeutic interventions, diagnostic tests and obtain specialty consultations when indicated.\" [The bold print was in their document] In addition to the above mentioned biased and unreferenced guidelines, the Army, I have been told, provides little in material support and space for their chiropractors. When you add up this adversarial behavior, the number of patients that can receive chiropractic care at Army sites decreases. Therefore the Army may justify reduction of the chiropractic presence due to under-utilization. This is exactly the opposite of the treatment that I have received with the Navy. Those of you who know me, know my typically optimistic views of the DOD project. However, I am greatly concerned about what the Army is trying to accomplish. If these guidelines and letter are an accurate representation of Army policy, I feel that the Army's Surgeon General should account for this policy to our elected leaders. My disclaimer: These documents came from a dedicated and reliable source, but are not signed. Another concern that should be addressed is that the employer of the chiropractors for the Army and Air Force, a government contractor, requires them to adhere to a strict gag clause that can cost them their jobs if they openly discuss their work environment. In other words, they are not allowed to discuss how the Army or Air Force treats them. Please take a moment to read the attached note.

He was born in Dana, Iowa on 4 October 1920. During World War II, he served as a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Force based in England and flew 31 bombing missions over Germany. He was given the Distinguished Flying Cross for his achievements as a lead pilot. Near the end of the war, he studied at Augustana College and St. Ambrose University and graduated from Palmer College of Chiropractic [sic] in 1947, as did his wife Juanita, and in 1961 was granted a Philosopher of Chiropractic degree. Dr. Crowder taught Technique and Instrumentation at Palmer, starting in 1947. Among the administrative offices he held at the College were Director of Student Services and Director of Student Clinics. He was named Director of Alumni in 1964 and Vice President of Development in 1971. Since 1947 he maintained a successful chiropractic practice in Davenport, where he conducted internship programs for many Palmerstudents. A lifelong servant to the community, he participated in many volunteer associations, including the Davenport Anti-Crime Foundation, Davenport Club, Putnam Museum, Council for Advancement and Support of Education, Davenport Kiwanis Club, Davenport Chamber of Commerce, Center for Active Seniors and Plus 60 Club. Dr. Crowder was also internationally known for his lectures about Palmer and chiropractic philosophy. He wrote numerous articles about chiropractic and before legalisation of chiropractic in all American states, he appeared as an expert witness on behalf of chiropractors being prosecuted for practising without a license. In 1999 he was named a Fellow in the Palmer Academy of Chiropractic for his service and commitment to the college, and he was the only DC to receive an honorary membership in the Legion of Chiropractic Philosophers. He was also a recipient of the PCC International Alumni Award, an honorary Doctor of Chiropractic Humanities degree, and a distinguished service award. He was a Fellow in the International Chiropractors Association. In his tribute to Dr. Crowder, Palmer president Dr. Guy Riekeman said, \"He was a legendary teacher who touched the lives of several generations of Palmer Chiropractors. As an administrator, he was an integral player in the effort to unite Palmer alumni into a cohesive unit to increase fundraising, student recruitment and chiropractic awareness to the general public. He was also my chiropractor, and each visit I saw him, I learned more deeply what it meant to be an artist and to love your profession. For the ten years I lived in Davenport, Dr. Crowder was my chiropractor, too, and it was his professionalism and dedication to chiropractic that first inspired me to become the fourteenth chiropractor in my family. Dr. Crowder is survived by his wife, Dr. Juanita Nichols Crowder, and their daughter Ann. 2003 (Apr 17): forward from J.C. Smith, M.A., D.C. (jcsmith@smithspinalcare.com): Here's a good account of the VA progress by the Chairman of the ACA, the tireless Jim Edwards. With his leadership and the help of Sec. Anthony Principi, the head of the VA, this program will someday soon actually be implemented. As one who lives near Robins AFB in a town with over 5,000 vets, it's been a long wait to offer vets the chiro care they need. Insider's Insight -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- by James Edwards, DC About the author: Dr. James Edwards, a 1977 graduate of Logan College of Chiropractic, is chairman of the Board of Governors of the American Chiropractic Association and president of the American Chiropractic Foundation. Dr. Edwards was appointed to the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts by two different governors, and recently completed his eighth year of service. He was named the Kansas Chiropractic Association's Doctor of the Year in 1991, and a Fellow of the International College of Chiropractors in 1995; In 2000, DC selected Dr. Edwards as its Doctor of the Year. I am excited to have the opportunity to write a regular column for Dynamic Chiropractic that focuses on the national chiropractic scene from an insider's perspective. As chairman of the ACA, much of the news discussed in this column will come from my involvement in association activities; however, I intend to present the information in a nonpartisan manner. I recently returned from Washington, D.C., where I presented testimony at the third meeting of the Veterans Affairs Chiropractic Advisory Committee. This first column will discuss the tentative agreements that have been reached thus far, and my impressions of the overall process. Prior to this meeting, a working draft of how chiropractic might best be implemented into the VA system was submitted to themembers by the committee chairman. The document was a compilation of the sentiments expressed by committee members during the first two meetings. This meeting concentrated on studying and revising the proposed document. Although the proposed draft is still subject to further amendment and revision, the following are areas in which I believe the committee has reached consensus: 1.. Qualifications - The first portion of the proposed document dealt with contracting qualifications for doctors of chiropractic into the VA system. The committee utilized the standard language for all the Title 38 professionals you would expect (U.S. citizen, English- speaking, professional license-holder, etc.). The only area of any controversy surrounded the \"graduated from a CCE-accredited institution\" language. Since some practicing DCs graduated before the inception of CCE, I look for protective \"grandfa-thering\" language to be included. 2.. Scope of practice - In the VA, doctors may be permitted to do any number of things according to their scope, but in actual practice, they are limited to perform only those things for which they have been privileged. Moreover, doctors' privileging may not exceed what their scope permits. Under these rules, the basic scope of chiropractic practice will include history-taking; performance of neuromusculo- skeletal and associated physical examinations; performance or ordering of X-rays; providing a diagnostic impression and treatment plan; referring to other healthcare providers (when appropriate); and performing chiropractic adjustments. The \"extra\" scope procedures (state law permitting) will include physiotherapy; ordering laboratory lifestyle; exercise; hygiene; and ergonomics. 3.. Access to chiropractic care - The VA system, not unlike the Department of Defense, is primary care provider (PCP)-driven. However, the chiropractic members of the committee were successful in including some provisions and language that provide for limited, direct access care. While discussions will continue on the matter, I believe there was consensus that - absent any \"red flags\" or overt contrain-dications - requests for chiropractic would be honored without a PCP referral. Also, there is language being proposed that will help ensure patients are afforded early access to DCs for non- musculoskeletal conditions, rather than being subjected to 6-8 weeks of allopathic trials by their PCPs before obtaining a referral. 4.. Full team membership - The draft proposal also includes recommendations for additional privileging after a year; full medical staff voting privileges for DCs at the facilities; recommendations surrounding coordination of care (the interdisciplinary, \"team- approach\" model); and a recommendation that DCs be included as appointees on other VA advisory committees, as appropriate. 5.. DC staffing - Discussion has been initiated regarding how best to implement doctors of chiropractic into the system. The committee tentatively agreed to recommend a minimum of two DCs at each facility providing chiropractic services. In addition, after its recommendations are submitted to the VA secretary regarding access, scope and qualifications, another significant challenge will be to develop (and subsequently recommend) a training/teaching program on chiropractic for all VA staff, including medical doctors. The VA Chiropractic Advisory Committee heard public testimony from the following individuals, representing the following organizations: a. Mr. David O'Bryon: the Association of Chiropractic Colleges; b. Wayne Wolfson, DC: the Federation of Chiropractic Licensing Boards; c. Matthew McCoy, DC: the World Chiropractic Alliance; d. Mr. David Chapman-Smith: the World Federation of Chiropractic; e. George McClelland, DC: the Foundation for Chiropractic Education and Research; f. Mr. Ronald Hendrickson: the International Chiropractors Association; and g. myself, representing the ACA. My remarks covered two major points. First, I emphasized the importance of direct access so veterans would not be subjected to artificial barriers to chiropractic care. Second, I discussed the extreme importance of DCs being able to practice under the full scope of their state chiropractic licenses. Although this meeting was much more contentious than the December meeting, as the political agendas of some of the six chiropractic members became transparent, I remain optimistic that they will be able to successfully create a new \"federal model.\" They continue to work well as a team, and are to be commended for their razor-sharp focus on ensuring chiropractic is implemented properly into the VA system. James Edwards, DC, Austin, Texas jamesedwards@jamesedwards.com 2003 (May 5): e-mail from William Morgan, D.C. (WEMorgan@Bethesda.med.navy.mil): Chiropractic fringe group offers a never-ending source of embarrassment and amusement Check out the attached documents http://www.worldchiropracticalliance.org/summit03/talking- points.htm http://www.worldchiropracticalliance.org/summit03/sample-letter.htm (Item # 6 and link to sample letter). This group of \"principled chiropractors\" is lobbying to force me to join their organization or to replace me. They erroneously believe that I am using my time treating members of Congress to lobby for the American Chiropractic Association. I have not spoken ill of other chiropractors or groups to anyone of my patients on the Hill. So far, the people in positions of power that I have shared this information with have been amused. I am not worried about this attempt, mainly because of my faith that God is always in control. It is a little embarrassing to have a group of avaricious (1), deceptive (2), naive (3), self-promoters try to undermine this position. I liken it to the familiar wedding scene in a comedy where a wedding is prepared to take place. Everything is perfect. The bride is beautiful and smiling. The handsome groom gazes at his bride, while the pews are filled with family and friends. The pastor comes to the point in the ceremony where he says \"if anyone knows of a reason that this marriage should not take place let him speak now or forever hold his peace.\" Then with a burst of commotion a crazed and disheveled relation stumbles into the sanctuary and slurs out some ridiculous accusations. The groom's mouth hangs in surprise, the bride begins to cry, the confused onlookers murmur and wonder with what kind of people are they associated. This scene is an illustration of what the WCA & ICA have done time and time again, most notably at the infamous VA meeting on February 24, 2000 in Washington, D.C.

FOR MORE INFORMATION, CALL: Patrick Bernat or Felicity Feather (800) 986-4636 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: July 23, 2003 U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DEMANDS VETERANS AFFAIRS DEPARTMENT HIRE DCS ARLINGTON, VA -- The House of Representatives has formally ordered the Department of Veterans Affairs to speed up the implementation of chiropractic services into the veterans health care system - a requirement that was passed into law in 1999 but has since been delayed by bureaucratic foot dragging. The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) and the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC) strongly supported the measure and have been working closely with a bipartisan coalition of key legislators to ensure its passage. The bill, known as the \"Veterans Health Care Improvement Act (HR 2357),\" was passed by voice vote on Monday, July 21. Championed by Rep. Jerry Moran (R-KS) and Rep. Rob Simmons (R-CT), Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Health, it contains a provision instructing the VA to hire and employ doctors of chiropractic. Legislation passed in 1999 (P.L. 106-117) required the VA to develop a plan for offering chiropractic care, but the new bill goes a step further and eliminates the remaining bureaucratic obstacles that have prevented the formal establishment of chiropractic clinical care in the VA. \"Millions of Americans use the services of doctors of chiropractic,\" said Rep. Moran during remarks on the House floor. \"However, veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system are unable to receive this specialty care. Numerous studies have demonstrated that chiropractic care can and is an effective therapy . . . Congress has acted twice before on chiropractic care in the VA health care system, but our intent has not yet been implemented by the Department of Veterans Affairs.\" The chiropractic provision also received strong bipartisan support from Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee and Rep. Lane Evans (D-IL), Rep. Bob Filner (D-CA), Rep. Susan Davis (D-CA), Rep. Ciro Rodriguez (D-TX), Rep. Jeb Bradley (R-NH) and Rep. John Larson (D-CT). \"The clear need for Congress to again address delays in implementation of chiropractic care benefits for veterans and the strong bi-partisan support created for the bill in Congress secured itspriority consideration on the House floor,\" said ACA President Daryl Wills, D.C. \"We thank all the representatives who went to bat for the chiropractic provision in this bill - and we are certain that the ultimate beneficiaries will be our nation's veterans who will finally receive the outstanding chiropractic care they need and deserve.\" HR 2357 now moves to the U.S. Senate. Earlier this month, the ACA and the ACC lobbying teams met with Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), the Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, to brief him on the need for prompt consideration of the chiropractic provisions of HR 2357. Senator Specter expressed his strong interest in the legislation and in taking steps to ensure that America's veterans have access to chiropractic care. The text of HR 2357, which also includes provisions extending veterans benefits to Filipino World War II veterans residing in the U.S, can be viewed on Thomas Web site, the Library of Congress's online information site: <http://thomas.loc.gov>. 2003 (July 26): e-mail forwarded: U.S. House Passes VA Chiropractic Employment BillAnother feather in the cap for the ACA Government Relations DATE: 7/22/03 RE: U.S. House Passes VA Chiropractic Employment Bill As you know, among ACA's top legislative priorities this year has been to encourage introduction and passage of legislation to overcome the bureaucratic resistance that has delayed implementation of the chiropractic care benefits Congress extended to America's veterans in 1999 and reaffirmed in 2001. I am pleased to report that yesterday, the U.S House of Representatives passed, by voice vote, the Veterans Health Care Improvement Act (HR 2357), legislation that includes the provisions of Rep. Jerry Moran's (R-KS) bill to provide the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) with the authority to hire and employ Doctors of Chiropractic. The Moran bill was designed to eliminate remaining bureaucratic obstacles and speed decision-making on establishment of chiropractic clinical care positions within the VA. The ACA and the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC) strongly supported the Moran bill and its inclusion in HR 2357, and worked closely in recent months with Rep. Moran, Rep. Rob Simmons (R-CT), the Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Health, and Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ), the Chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee to build support for the legislation. Other key supporters include Rep. Lane Evans (D-IL), Rep. Bob Filner (D-CA), Rep. Susan Davis (D- CA), Rep. Ciro Rodriguez (D-TX), Rep. Jeb Bradley (R-NH) and Rep. John Larson (D-CT). According to an article on yesterday's action in the House appearing in CQ Today, a Capitol Hill publication, \"A bi-partisan group of legislators has long pushed for chiropractic care at VA facilities, arguing that the treatment could prove especially therapeutic for the types of injuries sustained in combat...[HR 2357] would instruct the VA to develop treatment plans, hire chiropractors and set pay scales for them.\" HR 2357 now moves to the U.S. Senate. Earlier this month, the ACA and the ACC lobbying teams met with Senator Arlen Specter, the Chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, to brief him on the need for prompt consideration of the chiropractic provisions of HR 2357. Senator Specter expressed his strong interest in the legislation and in taking steps to ensure that America's former servicemen and women will soon get the chiropractic benefits they need and deserve. The text of HR 2357, which also includes a White House- supported provision to extend veterans benefits to Filipino World War II veterans residing in the U.S, can be viewed on THOMAS, the Library of Congress's online information site: http://thomas.loc.gov. Below are the remarks delivered yesterday on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives by Rep. Simmons, Rep. Davis and Rep. Moran on HR 2357: Mr. SIMMONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2357 , as amended, the Veterans Health Care Improvement Act of 2003. H.R. 2357 would provide two important new health services to veterans. First, the bill would clearly establish the authority of the Department of Veterans Affairs to appoint chiropractors within its health care system, allowing veterans to receive this care in VA facilities. Currently, veterans are not receiving this specialty care from VA because the VA has decided that chiropractic care is not necessary and duplicates services already provided by physicians, nurses, and physical therapists. For nearly 3 years, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs has been working to include chiropractic care as part of the VA's health care system. Through provisions in the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Programs Enhancement Act of 2001, the VA has been required to establish a policy for the role of chiropractic care for veterans and to provide chiropractic care and services for veterans in its health care system. By law, VA has also been required to establish a Chiropractic Advisory Committee within the Department. Although some progress has been made by the Advisory Committee on chiropractic care, veterans are dissatisfied with the VA's reluctance to fulfill its obligations under law. The gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MORAN), our former Health Subcommittee chairman, has spearheaded this important effort for our veterans, and I thank him for his leadership on this issue. Mr. Speaker, our bill would also authorize VA to provide health care services to Filipino World War II veterans who legally reside in the United States. During World War II, the Commonwealth of the Philippines army was called to serve with the U.S. Armed Forces. Tens of thousands of Filipino soldiers served alongside U.S. soldiers during World War II, exhibiting great courage and determination at the epic battles of Bataan and Corregidor and contributing to the successful outcome of the war. After the Philippines became an independent Nation, Congress passed the Rescission Act of 1946, reducing or eliminating many of the benefits that Filipino veterans had been eligible for based on service in the Commonwealth army. Today, almost 60 years later, 60,000 World War II Filipino veterans are alive and continue to seek restoration of these benefits. Approximately 14,000 Filipino veterans in the U.S. would be eligible for the VA health care services this bill would authorize. Today, Commonwealth army veterans and new Philippine Scouts residing in United States are only eligible for VA health care services if they are in receipt of a disability compensation. This legislation before us today would broaden eligibility for VA health care for all Filipino veterans residing in the United States. Commonwealth army veterans and new Philippine Scouts living in the United States would be subject to the same eligibility and means test requirements as American veterans. This bill would honor our commitment to those veterans by covering hospital, nursing home, and medical care services. I want to commend the gentleman from New Jersey, my chairman, the chairman of the full Committee on Veterans' Affairs, for his leadership in bringing this legislation forward; and I also commend the gentleman from California (Mr. FILNER) who has championed the cause of Filipino veterans for years and is due a great deal of credit for the legislation we put before the House today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join with the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. SIMMONS) today and rise in strong supportof H.R. 2357 . First, I would also like to recognize the commitment of the gentleman from California (Mr. FILNER), a long-time member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs and my San Diego colleague, to the cause of Filipino veterans. Mr. Speaker, the Filipino soldiers recruited to fight in the Pacific during the Second World War served proudly under General MacArthur and fought courageously against the enemies of the United States. Because their contributions were crucial to our victory, these brave soldiers thought that when the war was won, they would receive the same recognition as American soldiers fighting by their side. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, in 1946, Congress passed an act that rescinded the benefits it had granted to thousands of Filipino veterans, and this was wrong. This was wrong. And passing H.R. 2357 today will help correct this injustice. H.R. 2357 also contains a provision to allow the VA to hire chiropractors. Mr. Speaker, it is time that the VA recognized the value chiropractors can add as part of a health care service continuum. Chiropractors can help promote and maintain wellness rather than simply treating illness. Millions of Americans rely on their services to manage pain and treat a broad range of conditions. I am pleased to stand up on these bills today. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. SIMMONS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Kansas (Mr. MORAN), formerly the chairman of the Health Subcommittee of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, currently serving as vice chairman of that subcommittee and a tireless advocate for chiropractic care for our veterans. Mr. MORAN of Kansas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. SIMMONS) for yielding me this time. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here today as provisions of H.R. 2414, the Department of Veterans Affairs Chiropractic Employment Act, a bill that I introduced earlier this year, are included in this bill now before the House. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the full committee, as well as the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. SIMMONS), my predecessor as the chairman of the Health Subcommittee for their leadership and assistance in advancing this measure to the House floor today. Mr. Speaker, these provisions will prompt the Department of Veterans Affairs to make chiropractic care available to America's veterans in VA facilities by granting specific employment authority in VA for chiropractic care as clinicians under title 38 of the United States Code. Millions of Americans use the services of doctors of chiropractic. However, veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system are unable to receive this specialty care. Numerous studies have demonstrated that chiropractic care can and is an effective therapy. Mr. Speaker, Congress has acted twice before on chiropractic care in the VA health care system, but our intent has not yet been implemented by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Signed into law in 1999, section 303 of Public Law 106-117 required the VA Under Secretary for Health to establish a defined policy regarding the role of chiropractic care for veterans enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration. Almost a year later, the VA established what it deemed to be a ``policy'' on chiropractic care. However, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs found the VA's response to be inadequate. As a result, in 2001, 2 years later, Congress enacted section 204 of Public Law 107-135. This legislation required the Secretary of VA to create a program of chiropractic care and services for veterans who are enrolled in the VA health care system and specified that each of the VA's health care networks put at least one program in place. This law also required the establishment of a Chiropractic Advisory Committee within the Department and charged the committee toprovide assistance to the Secretary in developing and implementing the chiropractic health care program. While some progress has been made by the VA's Advisory Committee, the Department is now contending that formal organizational, qualification, and classification studies are needed due to the VA's lack of a specified employment authority in title 38 of the United States Code. Such an undertaking by the VA would probably require extensive use of specialized resources and more bureaucracy on the part of the Central Office, the Advisory Committee, the Office of Personnel Management, as well as outside consultants. We can remedy this situation with the bill before the House today to speed the VA's decision-making on establishing chiropractic clinical care positions within the Department. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Our bill will provide a specialty care program for our Nation's veterans, who are most deserving of this benefit. I again thank the chairman for his leadership. 2003 (Oct 27): e-news forwarded from J.C. Smith, M.A., D.C. (jcsmith@smithspinalcare.com): VA Chiropractic Advisory Committee Finalizes Recommendations Secretary Principi Expected to Review Soon The long effort to implement doctors of chiropractic into the Veterans' Health Administration (VHA) is coming to fruition. On Sept. 16-17, the Chiropractic Advisory Committee met for the final time to draft its recommendations to Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony J. Principi. These recommendations will set the stage for chiropractic care to be included in the 163 hospitals and 1,100-plus outpatient and other facilities that make up the VHA health care system. The 38 recommendations cover all aspects of chiropractic involvement in the system and address specific issues such as required education and licensure, staffing of the chiropractic offices, and equipment required. One of the more interesting aspects of the recommendations is the inclusion of voting and committee membership privileges, which makes chiropractors full team members. In addition, chiropractic is included in the inpatient care, outpatient facilities, fee-basis care and occupational health programs. Below is an abbreviated list of those recommendations that are most critical to understanding the role chiropractic doctors will play in the VHA health care system. (The entire report, with all of the Advisory Comittee's recommendations, can be found at www.chiroweb.com/va.) Rec. 4: Scope of Practice Doctors of chiropractic shall provide patient evaluation and care for neuro-musculoskeletal conditions including the subluxation complex within the boundaries set by state licensure, VHA privileging and the doctor's ability to demonstrate educational training and clinical competency in the areas necessary to provide appropriate patient care. Rec. 5: Minimum Initial Privileges Minimum initial privileges, based on the state licensure of the doctor of chiropractic, should include: history taking, neuromusculoskeletal examination and associated physical examination, ordering of standard diagnostic plain film radiologic examinations, determine appropriateness of chiropractic care, provide chiropractic care (adjustment, manipulation/mobilization, manual therapy), manage neuromus-culoskeletal care, referral to appropriate provider. Rec. 6: Other Initial Privileges When permitted by the state licensure of the doctor of chiropractic and the privileging process for the VA facility, additional initial privileges may include: 1. Ordering of additional diagnostic studies (imaging, clinical laboratory, other appropriate tests). 2. Order or provide other treatment modalities (physical modalities, ergonomic evaluation, orthotics, supportive bracing, counseling/education on body mechanics, nutrition, lifestyle, exercise, hygiene). Rec. 7: Additional Privileges After the initial annual evaluation, the doctor of chiropractic may request additional privileges, which may be granted by the privileging facility consistent with the needs of the facility and the licensure held by the doctor of chiropractic, upon demonstration of appropriate training and competency. Rec. 9: Access to Chiropractic Care Access to chiropractic care should be by consultation with the patient's primary care provider or another VA provider who is treating the patient for the condition(s) for which chiropractic care is indicated. VHA facilities should establish processes that will ensure patients are adequately informed about treatment options, including chiropractic care, when presenting to urgent care with acute neuromusculoskeletal conditions appropriate for chiropractic care, when calling to request a primary care appointment for acute neuromusculoske-letal conditions, or when receiving care for difficult, chronic and otherwise unresponsive neuromusculoskeletal conditions. Patients presenting with neuromusculoskeletal complaints who prefer chiropractic care as their treatment option should be referred to a doctor of chiropractic for evaluation and care. Veterans who have been referred to and have received care from a doctor of chiropractic should continue to have access to the doctor of chiropractic for the continuation of care or treatment, consistent with facility policy for specialty care access. Rec. 15: Screening of Patients The doctor of chiropractic should screen patients to identify the following \"red flags\" or contraindications to manual therapy: 1. Possible fracture from major trauma or minor trauma in an osteoporotic patient. 2. Possible tumor or infection in patients with a history of cancer, recent fever, unexplained weight loss, recent bacterial infection, IV drug abuse or immune suppression 3. Possible cauda equina syndrome noted by saddle anesthesia, recent onset of bladder dysfunction, progressive neurologic deficit or major motor weakness in the lower extremity (not sciatica), unexpected laxity of the anal sphincter sensory loss.1 Rec. 16: Referral Service Agreements VHA should encourage the development of referral service agreements between doctors of chiropractic and both primary care and other specialty providers regarding the types of conditions appropriate for referral to chiropractic care, and the pre-referral testing that will be useful to optimize the provider's time. The authorization mechanism for chiropractic referrals, follow-up, and recurrent care should be consistent with the facility's business practices for other referrals. Rec. 17: Referrals From Doctors of Chiropractic Doctors of chiropractic may make referrals to other VHA services and/or providers as appropriate, subject to facility protocols. Rec. 18: Coordination of Care The doctor of chiropractic and the patient's primary provider, in conjunction with other appropriate VHA providers, should develop a collaborative treatment regime when patients present with concurrent neuromusculoskeletal and non-neuromusculoskeletal problems. Rec. 19: Co-Management of Care As a member of the VHA health care team, doctors of chiropractic should co-manage patient care for neuromuscu-loskeletal conditions as appropriate, along with the patient's primary provider, other team members, and specialists. Rec. 20: Placement of Doctors of Chiropractic Within a Health Care Team Doctors of Chiropractic should be integrated into the VHA health care system as a partner in a health care team. Rec. 27: Orientation A standardized orientation program on how chiropractic care is to be integrated into VHA should be developed and presented to clinical and administrative staff at each facility prior to the actual implementation of a chiropractic service. VHA should develop a basic orientation program for doctors of chiropractic that can be modified for differences in facilities. Rec. 29: Education of Patients VHA will provide standardized information to patients regarding the availability of chiropractic care. Each VISN will provide information to patients on how to access chiropractic services within the VISN. VISN Directors should assure the widest dissemination possible using multiple modalities. Rec. 32: Evaluation of Chiropractic Care Program A formal evaluation of the challenges and benefits of providing chiropractic care within VHA should be completed by the conclusion of the third year of implementation. Formal progress reports should be completed at least annually and provided to the Secretary, the Under Secretary for Health, the Deputy Under Secretaries for Health, other members of the National Leadership Board, and made available to interested stakeholders. Rec. 38: Research VHA, in conjunction with its chiropractic providers and chiropractic educational programs, should conduct clinical research relevant to the type of conditions and services provided by doctors of chiropractic. (See table at left.) Emphasis should be placed on common service-connected conditions. Research related to integration of multidisciplinary providers into teams should also be undertaken. 2003 (Dec 4): e-mail forwarded from J.C. Smith, M.A., D.C. (jcsmith@smithspinalcare.com): The Truth About the Recommendations of the VA Committee by Cynthia S. Vaughn, DC \"Our recommendations are for full scope of practice; even more importantly, they provide four protocols under which a veteran will be able to access chiropractic care.\" - Dr. Cynthia S. Vaughn Although some have criticized the recommendations of the VA Committee, since they do not recommend \"pure\" direct access in all cases, they have missed the bigger issue. This is not about \"direct access\" for our profession; this is about veterans being able to access chiropractic care. In other words, it's not about us - it's about veterans. And as long as veterans are able to reasonably access chiropractic care without having to jump over artificial barriers, that's all that is needed. If the Secretary agrees to our recommendations, veterans will most certainly be able to reasonably access chiropractic care. Our recommendations do not represent merely \"getting our foot in the door,\" like Medicare was. Our recommendations are for full scope of practice; even more importantly, they provide four protocols under which a veteran will be able to access chiropractic care: 1. \"pure\" direct accesses for newly discharged veterans without a referral from a PCP (primary care provider); 2. by merely consulting with the PCP, which may not even require the patient be seen; 3. by referral from the PCP, particularly when it is a neuromusculoskeletal complaint and the patient \"prefers\" chiropractic; and 4. by changing the PCP to one who will refer to a doctor of chiropractic. The most interesting part about the criticism is that it seems to be coming from those in the profession who have traditionally argued that a differential diagnosis is not necessary, and that chiropractic care should be limited to the detection and correction of subluxations. With all due respect, it doesn't work both ways. Although some may be able to practice that way in the private sector, the VA is very different. In other words, if a doctor of chiropractic wants to be a direct-access, first-contact provider for veterans, there is an inherent, inseparable responsibility attached to that privilege. To a great extent, the \"subluxation only\" philosophy espoused by some chiropractic Web sites and in correspondence received by the VA made the medical members uncomfortable, and doomed any real chance we had to convince the medical members of the Committee that doctors of chiropractic were qualified to serve in the important first-contact, direct-access (\"gatekeeper\") role. It is important to point out a key factor about the VA. The VA is different from the private sector, where HMO medical gatekeepers have a financial disincentive to refer patients for chiropractic care. The VA employs staff physicians who are salaried, and as such, their incomes are not reduced when they refer patients for chiropractic care, rather than keep them under medical care. Therefore, the barriers patients have experienced with medical gatekeepers in the private sector are not necessarily ones those veterans will face in the VA system. Once doctors of chiropractic are in the system, with offices down the hall, earning the same salary, whether they see one patient per day or 100 patients per day, they will be utilized. I believe the doctors of chiropractic who are eventually hired into the VHA system will be incredibly busy. Those who have the most experience with the system share that opinion. One military DC sent me the following unsolicited comment: \"Having worked with military health care for 8 years at Scott AFB and now with the Navy, I can tell you we will be appreciated in the VA system, once rational DCs are allowed the opportunity to practice and interact with the medical staff. Resistance from PCMs falls away with results and communication.\" For a \"second opinion,\" here is another unsolicited comment from a military DC: \"I currently work as a chiropractor at Ireland Army Hospital in Fort Knox, KY and I have been met with nothing but respect and had no problems with getting referrals for patients. As a matter of fact, I started here in July of this year and by Sept 1, I was seeing a full load of patients. Now, my new patients are booked 2 to 3 weeks out!\" Some have expressed concerns that the recommendations are similar to the current program, where chiropractic care has been available by referral through the \"fee basis\" system (a true \"gatekeeper\" model) for quite some time, yet history has shown it to be woefully underutilized. Therefore (they assert), by not ensuring \"pure\" direct access, it represents nothing more than what we have now. This is completely inaccurate, or - as the expression goes - \"comparing apples to oranges.\" The reality is that the VA fee basis system has rarely been used because it added additional administrative hurdles to the referral process;, the VA providers didn't know the doctors of chiropractic in the community; and it required money to be distributed to practitioners outside the system. Under our recommendations, a PCP should refer a veteran to a doctor of chiropractic when chiropractic care is indicated and when the veteran requests it. Specifically, recommendation #9, as submitted reads, \"Patients presenting with neuromusculoskeletal complaints who prefer chiropractic care as their treatment option should be referred to a doctor of chiropractic for evaluation and care.\" [Emphasis added] Should the PCP not refer in these instances, the VA already has provisions in place whereby the veteran may change his/her PCP. You can be extremely proud of the Committee's recommendations to Secretary Principi, and optimistic that he will accept them. If that occurs, our nation's veterans will finally be able to access the chiropractic care they need and deserve, and in the process, a new full-scope federal model will have been created. Cynthia S. Vaughn, DC, Member, Veterans Affairs Chiropractic Advisory Committee DrVaughn@ChiroAustin.com Editor's note: For background information, please read \"VA Chiropractic Advisory Committee Finalizes Recommendations,\" DC, Nov. 17, 2003. www.chiroweb.com/archives/21/24/17.html. 2004 (Jan 14): e-mail forwarded by J.C. Smith, D.C., M.A. (jcsmith@smithspinalcare.com): Once again the demagogues in the ICA and WCA have distorted the truth about the VA issue to arouse negative emotions in their readers. While these chiropracTORs may fool some of the readers some of the time, no doubt most will realize their lies and this will only add to their disingenuous image as propagandists rather than fair and objective reporters. Enjoy, JCS Subject: [aca-hod] ACA statement on VA recommendations Dear ACA House of Delegates: Below please find ACA's response to the misleading articles regarding the VA recommendations that have appeared in recent publications of the ICA and WCA. This statement has been approved by the ACA Board of Governors. Sincerely, Patrick Bernat, Associate Director, Public and Media Relations American Chiropractic Association 1701 Clarendon Blvd, Arlington, VA 22209 800-986-4636, ext. 240 ACA RESPONDS TO MISLEADING ARTICLES IN RECENT ICA AND WCA PUBLICATIONS The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) is compelled to respond to recent front-page articles carried in the December 2003 issue of The Chiropractic Choice published by the International Chiropractors Association (ICA) and the January 2004 issue of The Chiropractic Journal published by the World Chiropractic Alliance (WCA). These two articles are sensational in their reporting and omit important facts and complexities involved in the Department of Veterans Affairs' Chiropractic Advisory Committee process and the recent recommendations sent to Secretary Anthony J. Principi. The ICA specifically accuses ACA of \"voting for MD referral\" and both articles profess that ACA members are against direct access to chiropractic care. These two articles give the uninformed reader an inappropriately negative take on the VA Committee's recommendations, which are quite positive and herald a new day for veterans and the chiropractic profession. The American Medical News recently reported, \"Chiropractic care at the Dept. of Veterans Affairs could expand dramatically, if the final recommendations of the VA chiropractic advisory committee are followed.\" The recent ICA article seems particularly intent on misrepresenting the facts and damaging the ACA when it wrongfully blames the ACA for voting on a committee recommendation they do not agree with. The ICA headline, \"...ACA votes for MD Referral\" is the most egregious, since ICA knows this is just not true. Dr. McLean and the ICA know that the ACA, ICA and WCA have NO standing or votes on the VA Committee. It has been made perfectly clear by the VA that the committee members were chosen to share their personal expertise in drafting recommendations for Secretary Principi, NOT as representatives for any organization. Each VA Committee member voted their personal conscience in light of all the facts and information presented to them. They voted for what they thought would best serve our nations veterans and the chiropractic profession. The ACA certainly did not vote \"for MD referral\" as the ICA alleges and did not vote on any of the other committee recommendations. ICA knows full well that the ACA and its members are NOT \"against direct access\" in the VA or any other institution or entity. Direct access is a principle the ACA fights for every day with insurance companies, regulatory agencies, in the courts and in Congress. The ACA Chairman testified before the VA Committee in favor of direct access. The ACA members on the VA committeesimply voted for what they believed would best serve veterans in this integration into the VA Health System. VA Committee members Dr. Michael McLean (quoted in ICA article) and Dr. Leona Fischer (author of WCA article) are also fully aware that their fellow committee members, Drs. Reed Phillips, Rick McMichael and Cindy Vaughn, are NOT \"against direct access\" in the VA or anywhere else. These committee members voted for Doctors of Chiropractic to be treated like all other specialists in the Veterans Health System (VHS). Here are a few important facts: The three ACA members on the committee voted FOR direct access on March 30, 2003. A 5-6 vote made direct access a dissenting recommendation, lacking the consensus of other committee members or even a simple majority. A minority recommendation was very unlikely to gain acceptance and be implemented by the VA. The three ACA members then worked with the committee to craft the strongest possible, high-consensus recommendation on access. They gained compromise language that deleted \"referral by\" the PCP in favor of \"by consultation with\" the PCP and other changes. The committee recommendations also included \"direct access\" for veterans who have received chiropractic care in the Military Healthcare System while on active duty. Never did any of the ACA members vote \"for MD referral\", but rather, \"Access to chiropractic care should be by consultation with the patient's primary care provider or another VA provider who is currently treating the patient....\" In fact, none of the ACA members ever voted \"against direct access\" since no vote was taken on the dissenting recommendation offered at the September 2003 meeting. The committee's chiropractic members were counseled by VFW's Michael O'Rourke (VFW represents millions of veterans) to work with other VA providers to allow veterans the best and most workable access to chiropractic care in the highly structured Veterans Health System. O'Rourke counseled that by working within the VHS our doctors of chiropractic would be kept very busy with patient care. Project Manager Sara McVicker, who Dr. Leona Fischer describes as \"a Godsend,\" also encouraged the DCs to work within the VA system that is based on PCP coordination of veterans' care. We agree with Dr. Fischer's remarks about Ms. McVicker, \"Her professionalism, attention to detail and knowledge of the system have been extremely valuable to us and greatly appreciated.\" Drs. Phillips, McMichael and Vaughn chose to heed the sincere counsel of McVicker and O'Rourke (based on their extensive VA knowledge and experience), while Drs. McLean and Fischer chose to ignore it. George Washington said, \"Truth will ultimately prevail where there are actions taken to bring it to light.\" For more of the VA story, we have attached the ACA's testimony to the VA Committee, and articles authored by Dr. William Morgan (Chief of Chiropractic Services at Bethesda National Naval Medical Center) and by Drs. Rick McMichael and Cindy Vaughn (VA Committee members). The ACA is committed to truth and honesty in reporting and will not hesitate to hold other organizations and individuals to the same standard. The type of information contained in these recent ICA and WCA articles serves to foster further division within the profession. We can do better. Honest and complete reporting by all individuals and organizations will increase understanding and improve our intra- professional relationships. Differences in opinion and strategies will occur, but we must all commit to reporting complete and accurate information. Is that really too much to ask? Watch ACA publications for positive news regarding progress in bringing chiropractic care to veterans. The integration of full-scope chiropractic care in the VA will be a great step forward for veterans and for our profession. Along with the integration of chiropractic care in the Department of Defense (now at some 37 sites by last count), this truly does herald a new era for the chiropractic profession and our patients. It is time for us all to focus on the positives of these historic events and work together to accomplish our vision of the future, where all people have access to our care.2004 (Feb 19): e-mail forwarded by J.C. Smith, M.A., D.C. (jcsmith@smithspinalcare.com): Spotlight on William Morgan, DC Congratulations to Bill Morgan, Capitol Chiropractor, for being named the ACA's Chiro of the Year. Couldn't have happened to a nicer and more deserving guy. Instead of listening to pseudo-spokesmen in our ranks who've accomplish nothing but rancor, perhaps every DC should hear what Dr. Morgan has to say! regards, JCS -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Spotlight on William Morgan, DC William Morgan did not initially intend to become a chiropractor. As a young man, he spent several years in the military and served as a medic, providing dive medicine, public health and paramedical care to U.S. Marine reconnaissance and Naval Special Warfare Unit One. Dr. Morgan's life changed shortly after being discharged from the Navy. He became interested in chiropractic after suffering a back injury; a local chiropractor relieved the pain traditional medicine was unable to treat. Inspired by the care he received, he switched college majors and enrolled at Palmer Chiropractic College West, receiving his degree from PCCW in 1985. For the next 13 years, Dr. Morgan was a tireless proponent of the chiropractic profession. Soon after completing his chiropractic education, he spent three months in the jungles of Liberia, providing chiropractic care to hundreds of people through the relief organization Partners International. He also played an integral role in the establishment of chiropractic services in medical clinics and a civilian hospital in California. In 1998, Dr. Morgan applied for - and was approved for - a position in the Chiropractic Department at the National Navy Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., one of the first sites set up as part of the Chiropractic Military Demonstration Project. Two years later, he became the Chiropractic Consultant to the Office of the Attending Physician (OAP) at the U.S. Capitol, a position that has allowed him to introduce the benefits of chiropractic to many of the nation's leaders, including members of Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court. In September 2003, the American Chiropractic Association bestowed on Dr. Morgan one of its highest honors, naming him its \"Chiropractor of the Year\" for his years of service to the profession and his ability to integrate chiropractic into the conventional health care system. In this exclusive interview with Dynamic Chiropractic, Dr. Morgan talks about his role at the National Naval Medical Center, his relationship with other health care providers (and their opinions toward chiropractic), and several exciting projects he and his fellow chiropractors are developing. Dynamic Chiropractic (DC): Dr. Morgan, what got you interested in chiropractic? Dr. William Morgan (WM): I injured my back when I was a young man, shortly after my discharge from the Navy. When the physicians and therapists weren't able to help me, I went to a chiropractor. Dr. Westfall was remarkably good, and he helped my condition in a significant way. After some reflection, I changed majors in school, and became a chiropractor. DC: How did chiropractic tie in with your military career? WM: As a Navy hospital corpsman, I was trained in emergency medicine, dive medicine and special operations. When I became a chiropractor, I thought it would be great if I could become a chiropractor in the Navy. Of course, the Navy did not have chiropractors until a decade after my graduation. So, when this position at the National Naval Medical Center opened up, I applied for it. I had been practicing for 13 years in California before I came here. DC: You're talking about the Chiropractic Military Demonstration Project. How did you get involved with the project? WM: I responded to a Navy advertisement in Dynamic Chiropractic for a chiropractic position opening at The NationalNaval Medical Center in Bethesda. From my time in the Navy, I knew that Bethesda was one of the best hospitals in the world. At that point I was in California, and was one of the few chiropractors who was working in a hospital. I applied for and was selected for the position at Bethesda, along with Dr. Kirk Parge. DC: You also work at the Capitol? WM: Yes, in the Capitol at the Office of the Attending Physician. The White House and the Capitol's medical departments are both run by the Navy. That's one of the missions of our hospital - to care for our country's leaders. This is the President's Hospital. DC: What are the differences between working at the Office of the Attending Physician and the naval hospital? WM: I am not at liberty to talk very much about my practice in the Capitol Building. I usually direct people with questions about my work at the Capitol to call the OAP. I work as a visiting specialist to the OAP, working at the Capitol two days a week. On May 11th, I will have worked at the Capitol for four years, so I think they're pretty happy with my work. The Office of the Attending Physician is run by my boss, Admiral John Eisold. You may have seen Dr. Eisold on TV when we had the anthrax attack, and this morning [Feb. 6] after ricin was found in one of the Senate buildings. What's special about Bethesda is that the neuromusculoskeletal specialties work as a team. This morning, one of my patient's MRI revealed a syrinx with a possible syringomyelia. I called up to the neurosurgery department and spoke with the neurosurgeon and neuroradiologist, and I got the patient in right away for an evaluation. We've broken down the walls for our different departments. We have formed a Neuromusculoskeletal Service Line consisting of podiatrists, physical therapists, chiropractors, occupational therapists, neurologists, neurosurgeons, neurora-diologists, rheumatologists, orthopedics, doctors of physical medicine - we're one big team, and we have streamlined the interactions between us. DC: Do you ever encounter any barriers that would preclude you from treating a patient? WM: There are times. A medical doctor may have a strong opinion on a subject, but I've got an opinion, too. We have discussions, and it's kept on an intellectual basis. DC: You don't have any instances where a medical doctor would say, \"Well, he's a chiropractor, he's not qualified to work on this patient.\" WM: I've had a couple of those instances. If I have somebody who has a condescending view of chiropractic, I usually try to rationally address the basis of their beliefs. When you're in a hospital, part of the code of conduct is that you can't speak in a seditious way about other staff members. A staff member can lose their hospital privileges by spreading damaging gossip about another provider. If a doctor wants to attack me on other grounds, fine. If a doctor questions the soundness of my treatment plan, he is not attacking me personally - that is OK, but nobody can attack me personally or make blanket statements about our profession. If I hear of another provider attacking chiropractic I usually arrange to speak with that provider individually. I am usually able to refute their mistaken conceptions and arrange for a one-hour in-service on chiropractic for their whole department. When I speak to medical departments, I encourage them to \"throw spears\" if they want. If I can't stand up to intellectual critique, maybe I am in the wrong job. DC: Tell us about some of the projects you're working on. WM: We have three research studies in the preliminary stages. I can't elaborate on them too much because we have strict codes of conduct with research, but we do have two human subject studies that we're in the preliminary planning stages, and we also are proposing a very exciting epidemiological stroke study with an eminent medical stroke researcher. That's a very exciting project. We have a few other projects. We have a chiropractor, Joanna Hudec, sponsored by Texas Chiropractic College completing a one- year residency in Hospital-Based Chiropractic. During thisfellowship, Dr. Hudec has completed a rigorous year of hospital rotations, academics, and skills training. I wrote this fellowship based on the medical model for residential study. Dr. Hudec is now prepared clinically and administratively to establish and run a hospital-based chiropractic clinic. She has also been working at our on-base medical school providing chiropractic care to medical students at the student clinic. I also would like to mention Dr. Terry Kearney, another staff chiropractor here. He administers our chiropractic student program. We have chiropractic students from New York Chiropractic College come down here for five months at a time. They do rotations through the medical departments in the morning, and they treat chiropractic patients in the afternoon. Dr. Kearney and I are adjunct faculty for NYCC. We also have medical residents, interns and students rotate through our chiropractic clinic. One of the medical students spent the day with me today. They come through and learn about chiropractic by rotating through our facility. I should mention that we teach them about chiropractic, not how to adjust. Finally, all of Bethesda's spine-related specialties are working to create a multidisciplinary center of excellence for spinal care: The Defense Spinal Center. DC: How do you think these projects are going to help advance chiropractic? WM: With scientific research, you never know. If you ask a sound scientific question, you might not always like the answer that research provides. We have to ask questions and live with the answers. It's also my belief that the chiropractic profession is ready for residencies and internships where we're actually in hospitals. In a hospital, you're exposed to a great range of diagnostic tools and a wide assortment of maladies. A student will learn far more about a disease or malady by seeing and examining patients with that disease than just reading about it. We definitely don't want to become medical doctors; we want to create better chiropractors. There are 800 other providers credentialed at this hospital. Virtually every one of them knows more about medicine than I do. I do not see the need for a chiropractor to prescribe drugs; it is hard enough to master clinical chiropractic skills. But, while there are 800 providers that may [know] more about drugs than I do, I would say I've done more spinal exams than anyone else in the hospital. DC: Any final thoughts you'd like to share? WM: The focus of a good chiropractor should not be on self; the focus of your life as a chiropractor should always be on your patients. Being a chiropractor is not about degrees, patient numbers, fees, practice management, modalities, or philosophy. Being a chiropractor is entirely about helping a world of hurting and ill people, people we have sworn to serve. DC: Thank you. Interview and article by Michael Devitt, senior associate editor 2004 (Mar): Journal of the ACA [41(3)] includes: -\"Chiropractic in PRINCIPI GREEN-LIGHTS CHIROPRACTIC CARE FOR AMERICA'S VETERANSWashington, DC - The American Chiropractic Association (ACA) and the Association of Chiropractic Colleges (ACC) commended Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) Secretary Anthony Principi for issuing an historic and far-reaching blueprint for formalizing the full inclusion of chiropractic care into the massive veterans health care system in the United States. Secretary Principi's decision today to implement more than three dozen recommendations made by a multi-disciplinary health care advisory panel will dramatically improve the quality of care available to millions of veterans in the U.S. and increase access to chiropractic care for every veteran who wants or needs to see a doctor of chiropractic. The Secretary's bold action originated with legislative directives from Congress in 2002 and 2003 - passed at the urging of the ACA, the ACC and America's veterans - to establish a permanent chiropractic benefit through the DVA system and authorize the DVA to hire and employ doctors of chiropractic as care providers. \"This is a great victory for veterans and an historic new opportunity for doctors of chiropractic across America,\" said ACA President and U.S. Navy veteran Donald Krippendorf, DC. \"Secretary Principi always makes certain that veterans come first. He's done so today by acting decisively to bring chiropractic care into veterans hospitals from coast-to-coast and to make doctors of chiropractic full partners in providing care to all those who answered our country's call to serve.\" Since the creation of the DVA health system, the nation's doctors of chiropractic (DCs) have been kept outside the system and all but prevented from providing proven, cost-effective and much-needed care to veterans, including those among the most vulnerable and in need of the range of the health care services DCs are licensed to provide. In 2002, 4.5 million patients received care in DVA health facilities, including 75% of all disabled and low-income veterans. Although the DVA health care budget is roughly $26 billion, in 2002, less than $370,000 went toward chiropractic services for veterans. In issuing today's order to his department to begin inclusion of chiropractic care, Secretary Principi specifically acknowledged that the goal is \"to ensure that chiropractic care is ultimately available and accessible to veterans who need it throughout the DVA system.\" Several key elements of Secretary Principi's blueprint were strongly supported by the ACA and the ACC, including: \u00b7DVA's endorsement of the integration of full-scope chiropractic care (under applicable state law) into all missions of the DVA health care system, including patient care, education, research and response to disasters and national emergencies, and DVA facilities across the country. \u00b7DVA's endorsement of a successful and patient-friendly model - essentially based on the operations of Bethesda National Naval Medical Center - of full integration of doctors of chiropractic as partners in health care teams. \u00b7Inclusion of chiropractic care into the VA's funding of research into treatment of service-connected conditions. \u00b7Inclusion of chiropractic colleges and students in training programs at VA facilities. \u00b7Establishment of a goal to ensure continuity of chiropractic care for newly discharged veterans who have been receiving chiropractic care through the Defense Department health care system. Jean Moss, DC, President of the ACC, commended Principi's decision to integrate chiropractic care into the DVA health system, saying, \"The administration, faculty and students of chiropractic colleges across America are delighted that Secretary Principi has taken steps to ensure that DCs can now directly contribute to the health and well-being of veterans. I am pleased, too, that chiropractic college students will become eligible to participate in internship programs at DVA hospitals and that a fair share of federal research funding will be directed to further documenting the efficacy and cost- effectiveness of chiropractic care.\"Dr. Krippendorf added, \"The ACA is a membership organization that is comprised of thousands of hard-working health professionals who are pillars of their communities in all 50 states. Our advocacy for full inclusion of chiropractic care in the DVA system is part of our broader campaign to ensure that DCs and their patients are treated fairly in all of the Federal government's health care programs and initiatives. We've made great progress across the board, but the fight for fairness continues and the ACA is ever vigilant.\" In addition to legislation authorizing the DVA to employ chiropractors (Public Law 108-170), ACA-backed bills to test expanded access to chiropractic services under Medicare (Public Law 108-173) and to accelerate the implementation of chiropractic care in the military (Public Law 108-136) were also signed into law by President Bush in 2003. In 2004, the ACA will make it a priority to ensure that Secretary Principi's recommendations are speedily implemented, and work with Congress on new legislation to ensure that chiropractic patients are never wrongly denied access to care. There are about 60,000 DCs in the U.S. and an estimated 25 million chiropractic patients. \"Today's historic action involved the hard work and determined efforts of several members of the DVA's Chiropractic Advisory Committee, including Drs. Reed Phillips, Cynthia Vaughn and Rick McMichael,\" said ACA Chairman and Army veteran George McClelland, DC. \"These outstanding leaders have helped improve America's veterans health care system, eliminated discriminatory practices against their fellow DCs and won meaningful protections for a most deserving group of chiropractic patients.\" 2004 (Apr 14): e-mail from Lieutenant Commander Richard D. Kildow, DC (RDKildow@nhcl.med.navy.mil): Good morning Dr. Keating, My name is Dr. Richard Kildow, DC, DACAN, CSCS. I am currently a DOD Chiropractor at Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, NC and have been for the last nine years. Last year I was mobilized as a Naval Special Operations Intelligence Officer to the Horn of Africa for seven months aboard the USS MOUNT WHITNEY. During the deployment it was learned by the Medical Officer (MO) aboard the ship that I was a Chiropractor. He asked if I would see some of his patients and of course I was happy to, but I wanted it to be in an official capacity, not just as an aside. The MO requested my credentials from the credentialing office at the hospital that I work for. The credentials were faxed and I became a licensed/credentialed chiropractor rendering Chiropractic care aboard a navy ship in a war zone. To my knowledge, this is the first time that \"officially recognized chiropractic care\" has ever been available aboard a ship and I would think that it would be important to have it recognized by an authority such as yourself. Who knows, maybe we can get a program initiated aboard ships at sea in addition to the bases. As you may know, some of the larger ships will contract teachers to teach, why not Chiropractors to treat? It is hard for me to imagine a more ergonomic challenging environment than a ship at sea. I am available for any follow-up questions at your leisure. Sincerely, Richard D. Kildow, DC LCDR USNR ____________________________________________________ References: Attention veterans!

In regard to the WOC article, I have sought to find out when did the government lift its ban on radio advertising. I went to the library hoping to find some historical material on radio advertising. That information exists somewhere however it was not in the local library. The Palmer's life style did not alter enough after the stock market crash to believe they were living off the PSC. I was always told that WOC kept the school afloat but not directly. It is factual that faculty members were paid through the early depression years with cash and WOC stock certificates. Those who stayed with the school for years thereafter were well repaid for their loyalty because the WOC stock escalated when WOC became a part of the Palmer Broadcasting Company. There was a proviso on the stock payment which was thatif the faculty member left the school he would be required to offer the stock to the Palmers at current value. This was to insure ownership by the family. At least two men were paid a half million dollars for their stock on retirement. It is not spoken of but Ronald Reagan was fired from WOC. Peter McArthur who was station manager was transferred to Des Moines to WHO at the same time. He saw talent in Reagan and brought him to Des Moines where his sports announcing career began. At the Crossroads is an excellent reconstruction of that interim in chiropractic history. This article has bidged the gap in my understanding of the NCA's activities and campaigns. I recall B.J. talking a great deal about the Steele case and the Boston case in Davenport. Thanks for sharing these two papers with me. Keep me posted on your location. Sincerely, NipHappy New Year! ___________________________________________ Other Sources: Jimmy Laux DC2B at Logan, 29 Boyd Avenue, Valley Park MO 63088; (314)225-2428; is conducting student research on chiropractors in the military Special report: House committee votes to include commissioning initiative in defense bill.
