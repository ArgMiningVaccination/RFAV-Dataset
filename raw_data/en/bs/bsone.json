According to Ayurveda, one of the reasons for this is varying degrees of bala\u2014immunity or general strength. If the pandemic has taught us anything, it is that a robust immune system can make all the difference in dealing with these novel viruses. Therefore, increasing our bala to live well and strongly through various seasonal changes, aging, and viral or bacterial infections that abound is essential. However, before we explore how to do it, let's discuss the three types of bala mentioned in Ayurvedic texts. Three Types of Bala There are three broad types of immunity, based on the time of the year, genetics, and one we develop by conscious effort. Heredity/Natural Immunity (Sahaja) We inherit a natural immunity from our parents. For those born with good immunity, it doesn't matter what they eat or drink, what seasons change, or what their body may be; they have the inherent strength to stay healthy and unaffected. Dr. Nisha Manikantan explains in her book, Ayurveda Simplified, \"According to yurveda's theory on genetics, genetic factors are defined at the cellular level. If both the parents' genetic makeup is healthy, the same health is seen in the children, whereas if their genetic makeup includes susceptibility to certain diseases, those diseases will be carried over into the next generation. The effect will be at the cellular, nuclear or chromosomal level.\" Changable/Time and Location (Klaja) Our immunity may be naturally strong in certain seasons and weaker in others, particularly during seasonal transitions. For example, you may feel more robust in winter than in the summer. Similarly, our immunity undergoes marked change through childhood, youth, and adulthood. Also, you may feel stronger in the mornings than in the evenings. There are also certain places where the climate supports better immunity. \"For example, places with an abundance of water, ponds, cool and pleasant climatic conditions are Kapha dominating areas and contribute to stronger immunity,\" according to Dr. Manikantan. So, the seasons, climate, and a person's age can all affect immunity. Established/Acquired (Yuktikrata) You can develop a permanent, more robust immunity over time with the right foods, lifestyle, spiritual practices, and rejuvenating herbs. This also involves developing a strong and happy mind. Read [Ayurvedic Kadha: A perfect Immunity Booster ](https://www.artofliving.org/in-en/ayurveda/kadha-for-immunity) How can we increase our Bala? A big Ayurvedic secret to having a robust immune defense is following nature, that is, living in alignment with the seasons and following a proper seasonal routine or [ritucharya.](/blog/relationship-between-the-doshas-and-the-seasons/) Winter weather is cold, chilly, and full of moisture. It's the season when animals (including humans!) go into hibernation mode. Because these qualities generally define the Kapha dosha, winter is considered a Kapha season. A balanced Kapha dosha provides strength and stability to the body and mind. However, winter has cold and dry spells\u2014signs of the vata dosha. If you don't balance out the vata dosha, you may feel isolated and depressed. As we enter the kapha season, the air starts getting colder and heavier, but our natural healing system is unique and intelligently designed to give us a stronger digestive fire during winter to digest our food better, which releases more energy and vitality for us to survive the winter months. [Download the Dinacharya poster here.](/blog/dinacharya-the-ayurveda-daily-routine/) Eat Mindfully You may feel hungrier during winter. So it is a good idea to have unctuous, sour, salty or sweet, warming foods, healthy fats, have a wholesome diet that gives more strength and nourishes the body tissues. This is also the time of the year when we socialize more and tend to overeat. Though naturally, we can digest more than usual, overeating and binging on heavy complex carbs can make our digestive metabolism sluggish, lowering our immunity. Eat fresh, wholesome, immunity-boosting foods, such as - Milk - Seasonal fruits & vegetables - Nuts & seeds - Whole grains - Lentils - Beans - Ghee Avoid processed, canned, frozen foods, or packaged foods, as well as eating leftovers, chemical-laden foods, and foods containing preservatives. You should also avoid cold foods and iced drinks as they may weaken the digestive fire. [Here's what an ideal diet](/blog/relationship-between-the-doshas-and-the-seasons/) for the winter looks like, according to Ayurveda. As you will read in the article linked, you should switch your dietary habits between high-Vata early winter and the Kapha-dominant deeper winter months to keep your doshas in check. Spices for the Season Cook with warm, astringent, bitter, and pungent-tasting spices like turmeric, ginger, cumin, black pepper, cinnamon, and coriander to reduce kapha accumulation at this time of the year.

What separates people who often fall sick from those who don't is having a routine aligned with the demands of changing seasons of the year. Lack of routine, irregular sleeping, and bad eating habits can also affect your biorhythm and quickly lower your Bala. Now is also an excellent time for seasonal Ayurveda detoxes like Virechana, Swedana, and Abhyanga. Also, if enough sunlight is available, consider taking 15-minute sunbaths daily. Vihara: Lifestyle Habits Here are a few lifestyle habits, also called Vihara in Ayurveda, to nurture during these cold months: - Work out or practice yoga every day to counter Kapha accumulation. - Perform [daily abhyanga](/blog/abhyanga-ayurveda-self-massage/) to nourish and keep the skin and joints from drying.
