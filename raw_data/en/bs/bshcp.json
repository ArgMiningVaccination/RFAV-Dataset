Panelists participate via self-administered web surveys. Panelists who do not have internet access at home are provided with a tablet and wireless internet connection. Interviews are conducted in both English and Spanish. The panel is being managed by Ipsos. Data in this report is drawn from ATP Wave 123, conducted from March 13-19, 2023, and includes an [oversample of Asian, Black and Hispanic adults](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/25/oversampling-is-used-to-study-small-groups-not-bias-poll-results/) in order to provide more precise estimates of the opinions and experiences of these smaller demographic subgroups. These oversampled groups are weighted back to reflect their correct proportions in the population. A total of 10,701 panelists responded out of 11,986 who were sampled, for a response rate of 89%. The cumulative response rate accounting for nonresponse to the recruitment surveys and attrition is 4%. The break-off rate among panelists who logged on to the survey and completed at least one item is 1%. The margin of sampling error for the full sample of 10,701 respondents is plus or minus 1.4 percentage points. Panel recruitment The ATP was created in 2014, with the first cohort of panelists invited to join the panel at the end of a large, national, landline and cellphone random-digit-dial survey that was conducted in both English and Spanish. Two additional recruitments were conducted using the same method in 2015 and 2017, respectively. Across these three surveys, a total of 19,718 adults were invited to join the ATP, of whom 9,942 (50%) agreed to participate. In August 2018, the ATP switched from telephone to address-based recruitment. Invitations were sent to a stratified, random sample of households selected from the U.S. Postal Service's Delivery Sequence File. Sampled households receive mailings asking a randomly selected adult to complete a survey online. A question at the end of the survey asks if the respondent is willing to join the ATP. In 2020 and 2021 another stage was added to the recruitment. Households that did not respond to the online survey were sent a paper version of the questionnaire, $5 and a postage-paid return envelope. A subset of the adults who returned the paper version of the survey were invited to join the ATP. This subset of adults received a follow-up mailing with a $10 pre-incentive and invitation to join the ATP. Across the five address-based recruitments, a total of 23,176 adults were invited to join the ATP, of whom 20,341 agreed to join the panel and completed an initial profile survey. In each household, one adult was selected and asked to go online to complete a survey, at the end of which they were invited to join the panel. Of the 30,283 individuals who have ever joined the ATP, 12,433 remained active panelists and continued to receive survey invitations at the time this survey was conducted. The U.S. Postal Service's Delivery Sequence File has been estimated to cover as much as 98% of the population, although some studies suggest that the coverage could be in the low 90% range. [1](#fn-4200-1) The American Trends Panel never uses breakout routers or chains that direct respondents to additional surveys. Sample design The overall target population for this survey was non-institutionalized persons ages 18 and older living in the U.S., including Alaska and Hawaii. It featured a stratified random sample from the ATP in which Hispanic adults, non-Hispanic Black adults and non-Hispanic Asian adults were selected with certainty. The remaining panelists were sampled at rates designed to ensure that the share of respondents in each stratum is proportional to its share of the U.S. adult population to the greatest extent possible. Respondent weights are adjusted to account for differential probabilities of selection as described in the Weighting section below. Questionnaire development and testing The questionnaire was developed by Pew Research Center in consultation with Ipsos. The web program was rigorously tested on both PC and mobile devices by the Ipsos project management team and Pew Research Center researchers. The Ipsos project management team also populated test data that was analyzed in SPSS to ensure the logic and randomizations were working as intended before launching the survey. Incentives All respondents were offered a post-paid incentive for their participation. Respondents could choose to receive the post-paid incentive in the form of a check or a gift code to Amazon.com or could choose to decline the incentive. Incentive amounts ranged from $5 to $20 depending on whether the respondent belongs to a part of the population that is harder or easier to reach. Differential incentive amounts were designed to increase panel survey participation among groups that traditionally have low survey response propensities. Data collection protocol The data collection field period for this survey was March 13-19, 2023. Postcard notifications were mailed to all ATP panelists with a known residential address on March 13. Invitations were sent out in two separate launches: soft launch and full launch. Sixty panelists were included in the soft launch, which began with an initial invitation sent on March 13. The ATP panelists chosen for the initial soft launch were known responders who had completed previous ATP surveys within one day of receiving their invitation. All remaining English- and Spanish-speaking panelists were included in the full launch and were sent an invitation on March 14. All panelists with an email address received an email invitation and up to two email reminders if they did not respond to the survey. All ATP panelists who consented to SMS messages received an SMS invitation and up to two SMS reminders. Data quality checks To ensure high-quality data, the Center's researchers performed data quality checks to identify any respondents showing clear patterns of satisficing. This includes checking for very high rates of leaving questions blank, as well as always selecting the first or last answer presented. As a result of this checking, no ATP respondents were removed from the survey dataset prior to weighting and analysis. Weighting The ATP data is weighted in a multistep process that accounts for multiple stages of sampling and nonresponse that occur at different points in the survey process. First, each panelist begins with a base weight that reflects their probability of selection for their initial recruitment survey. These weights are then rescaled and adjusted to account for changes in the design of ATP recruitment surveys from year to year. Finally, the weights are calibrated to align with the population benchmarks in the accompanying table to correct for nonresponse to recruitment surveys and panel attrition. If only a subsample of panelists was invited to participate in the wave, this weight is adjusted to account for any differential probabilities of selection. Among the panelists who completed the survey, this weight is then calibrated again to align with the population benchmarks identified in the accompanying table and trimmed at the 1st and 99th percentiles to reduce the loss in precision stemming from variance in the weights. Sampling errors and tests of statistical significance take into account the effect of weighting. The following table shows the unweighted sample sizes and the error attributable to sampling that would be expected at the 95% level of confidence for different groups in the survey. Sample sizes and sampling errors for other subgroups are available upon request. In addition to sampling error, one should bear in mind that question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls. Adjusting income and defining income tiers To create upper-, middle- and lower-income tiers, respondents' 2021 family incomes were adjusted for differences in purchasing power by geographic region and household size. Middle-income adults live in families with annual incomes that are two-thirds to double the median family income in the panel (after incomes have been adjusted for the local cost of living and household size). The middle-income range for the American Trends Panel is about $43,800 to $131,500 annually for an average family of three. Lower-income families have incomes less than roughly $43,800, and upper-income families have incomes greater than roughly $131,500 (all figures expressed in 2021 dollars). Based on these adjustments, 29% of respondents in Wave 123 are lower income, 47% are middle income and 18% fall into the upper-income tier. An additional 6% either didn't offer a response to the income question or the household size question. Here is [more information about how the income tiers were determined](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/W115-ATP-Methodology_school-shootings_for-production.pdf). Dispositions and response rates In-depth interviews Pew Research Center completed a series of individual in-depth interviews from March 21-April 3, 2023. The interviews were conducted by Public Opinion Strategies. A total of 22 interviews were held to explore the views of adults who expressed hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines and boosters or childhood vaccines such as the vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Each interview was held in person for 30 minutes. The recruiting process required interviewees to have not received a COVID-19 vaccine booster in the last six months in order to qualify. Recruitment emphasized those residing in suburban zip codes; those currently raising a child under age 18; those who were entirely unvaccinated against COVID-19; those whose children had not been vaccinated against MMR; and those who had concerns about either COVID-19 vaccines or their child's MMR vaccines. The selection process also ensured a range of participants across characteristics including gender, age, parenthood status and vaccination status. Interviews were held in Cincinnati, Ohio; Phoenix, Arizona; Seattle, Washington; and Jacksonville, Florida. A summary of the interviews is shown in the table. The interviewer guide is included here. All interviews explored both views of COVID-19 vaccines and those of childhood vaccines. For both types of vaccines, conversations covered a range of attitudes including views on health benefits and risks, reliable information and the choices individuals made for themselves and their children about vaccines. \u00a9 Pew Research Center 2023 "}
