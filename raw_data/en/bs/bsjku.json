This document summarizes the findings from the 18 -month Community Health Assessmen t process led by the Partnership for a Healthy Durham, the Certified Healthy Carolinians program of Durham County. The Partnership's Community Health Assessment Team consisted of community members, representatives of the Durham County Department of Publ ic Health as well as Duke Health, including Duke University Hospital and Duke Regional Hospital; City of Durham and Durham County governments, East Durham Children's Initiative, El Centro Hispano, Durham Partnership for Children, Partnership for Seniors, Project Access of Durham County, Durham Public Schools, TRY, LGBTQ Center of Durham, Duke University and many more partners. The team sought to include a variety of community health topics and to represent a broad range of opinions, ideas and data about th e county. The CHA process utilized a variety of strategies to ensure the report represents the opinions of a significant portion of community members, health care providers and stakeholders. As suc h, there are 14 chapters with 48 sections on various comm unity health topics. For more information on the Partnership for a Healthy Durham, visit www.healthydurham.org , Twitter or Facebook . Community Health Assessment Process The 2017 assessment process included 358 resident surveys from randomly selected households and three community listening sessions with 42 communit y members. For the past year, 95 individuals have contributed to the writing of this document. Individuals representing hospitals, universities, local government, schools, non -profit organizations, and faith -based organizations have worked to ensure that the activities of the assessment process and the written content reflect what is happening in Durham. Each Durham Community Health Assessment process utilizes community input sessions and culminates in the selection of health priorities and the compilation of recommendations or ideas for how to address the top five health priorities. The priorities were identified in an What is a Community Health Assessment? A process by which community members gain an understanding of the health concerns that affect their county by collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information on community assets and needs. The process culminates in the selection of community health priorities. The State of North Carolina requires that all Local Health Departments submit a comprehensive Community Health Assessment at least once every four years and a State of the County Health Report (SOTCH) in each of the interim years. The Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (health care ref orm), also requires non-profit hospital systems to conduct a community health assessment every three years. Current and previous assessments and health reports can be viewed at www.healthydurham.org . 2 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment online convenience sample conducted in January and February 2018. The next step is a strategic planning process to determine committees for the Partnership for a Healt hy Durham and create a three -year community health improvement plan (CHIP) for Durham County based on our findings. Sources Data in the 2017 Community Health Assessment came from: 1. County Community Health Assessment Survey: This anonymous survey, conduc ted in October and November 2016, used census data and Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) software to randomly select two samples of households in Durham County. In the first random sample, any household in Durham County was eligible to be selected. Only Latino and Hispanic residents were eligible to participate in the second random sample, and thus only households in census blocks with more than 50% Hispanic or Latino residents according to the 2010 Census were eligible to be selected. More details about the sampling methods are provided in Chapter 2. 2. Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS): This biannual survey is anonymous and includes a random sample of middle and high schools in the Durham Public School system. Schools are randomly selected to participate. Data from the 2015 survey is included in this document; the most recent survey was conducted in 2017, but data are not released from the CDC until the spring of 2018 and thus could not be analyzed in time to include in this document. 3. Community listening se ssions: Three listening sessions were held between November 2017 and March 2018. Community members who participated in listening sessions discussed health assessment findings and provided context and a richer picture of community needs and priorities in Du rham County. 4. Vital statistics (births, deaths, fetal deaths, pregnancies, marriage, and divorce) 5. The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (health behaviors and risk factors and self - reported disease information) 6. Basic Automated Birth Yearbook (BABY Book - summary of infant and maternal characteristics, such as prenatal visits and birth weight) 7. Cancer surveillance data 8. North Carolina Hospital Discharge Data 9. Agencies and organizations in Durham County Throughout the assessment, Durham's rates are comp ared with those of North Carolina and its five peer counties: Cumberland, Forsyth, Guilford, Mecklenburg and Wake. Data citations from each section appear at the end of the corresponding section. Summary of findings Areas to celebrate Durham Exceeds State Health Goalsi North Carolina has set 40 statewide health objectives with targets to reach by 2020. Durham State and County Overall Health Rankings, 2017 North Carolina : 33 out of 50 states Durham County: 15 out of 100 counties Source s: www.a mericashealthrankings.org www.countyhealthrankings.org 3 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment has seen improvement in 10 of the 40 objectives since 2013 and is meeting the state goals in 12. Many of the objectives do not show improvement such as homicide ra te, infant mortality racial disparity and adults with diabetes. While some of this is due to cuts in health services funding, the lack of improvement can be linked to health inequities which are the result of poverty, racism and discrimination. Many commun ities do not have equal opportunities because of lack of access to social determinants of health that have a strong impact on lives such as jobs, education, healthy foods and safe and affordable housing. Research shows that factors such as poverty, unemp loyment, low educational attainment, poor quality housing and environment shape health and play a role in health inequities. For these reasons, many communities cannot achieve health equity. These inequities to social determinants of health caused by prac tices, policies and legislation to maintain unequal distribution of power, most often affect communities of color. This is why there is an intersection between health and racial inequities. However, some of the objectives showing improvement are linked to Durham's health priority areas (physical activity, alcohol consumption by high school students, life expectancy). This community can take pride in these improvements. Below are the 12 state goals Durham meets: Unintentional poisoning mortality rate Percentage of women who smoke during pregnancy Suicide rate Percentage of adults meeting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention aerobic recommendations Average number of critical violations p er restaurant/food stand Percentage of children aged 1 -5 years enrolled in Medicaid who received any dental service* Infant mortality rate Percentage of the population being served by community water systems (CWS) with no maximum contaminant level violati ons Percentage of traffic crashes that are alcohol -related Pneumonia and influenza mortality rate Percentage of air monitor sites meeting the current ozone standard of 0.070 ppm Average life expectancy Durham County has many assets including the followin g: Education levels Durham County has more than twice the percentage of residents who have received a graduate or professional degree compared to North Carolina (21.6% vs. 10.2%).ii,iii Durham County is also home to several well respected institutions of hig her learning, including Duke University, North Carolina Central University and Durham Technical Community College. Community Engagement Durham's residents are very engaged in what occurs in the City and County. Between civic groups such as the InterNei ghborhood Council (INC), Durham CAN and organizations such as the Village of Wisdom and Partners Against Crime (PACs) districts, community members participate in a 4 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment variety of issues that impact Durham County residents. In 2018, three first -time members wer e elected to the City Council based on grassroots efforts and a desire for change in Durham. High number of medical providers and clinics Durham is a community rich in medical resources with an exceptionally good ratio of primary care providers to the number of residents (1:810). This compares to the state ratio of 1:1410 and far exceeds the top performing counties in the U.S. (1:1040).iv Durham County is ranked sixth in the state for Clinical Care.v As the home of Duke University Health System, there a re many medical experts in all fields. There are also many clinics that serve low -income and indigent residents such as Samaritan Health Center and CAARE Inc. and Lincoln Community Health Center, one of the oldest Federally Qualified Health Centers in the country. Project Access of Durham County (PADC) links eligible low -income, uninsured, Durham County residents with access to specialty medical care fully donated to the patients by the physicians, hospitals, labs, clinics and other providers participating in the network. Abundance of parks and open spaces Durham Parks and Recreation operates seven recreation centers. Amenities of these facilities include: seven gymnasiums, five dance studios, two indoor pools, three fitness facilities and two indoor wal king tracks. In addition, three outdoor pools are operated in the summer months. Durham has approximately 30 miles of accessible trails and greenways with approximately 178 miles of planned trails and greenways. Additionally, several trails in Durham pr ovide key linkages to the North Carolina Mountains to Sea Trail.vi Most pressing health concerns & priority issues The 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey asked residents to rank their top three community issues, health problems and serv ices needing improvement. A random sample of 210 households throughout the county were chosen in addition to a random sample of neighborhoods with more than 50% Latino households. Results are in the charts below:vii Top Responses From the Durham Full County Sample Community Issues Health Problems Services Needing Improvement 1. Substance use 1. Obesity/overweight 1. Higher paying employment 2. Discrimination and racism 2. Mental health 2. Sidewalks and bike lanes 3. Poverty 3. Diabetes 3. Affordable housing 5 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment \"I believe affordable housing is the most pressing issue we face in Durham. I don't have a solution but I feel this issue nee ds to be addressed immediately and with all resources available. Durham should be accessible to all its residents. \" - Durham County resident, 2018 Community Health Assessment Prioritization survey Durham County's top five health priorities were identified through an online survey in English and Spanish. The survey was also conducted in person at grocery stores, libraries, Durham County Department of Public Health clinics, and bus stations during January and February 2018. The purpose of the surve y was to narrow down priority health issues in Durham County. The five top health priorities are summarized below. The Partnership for a Healthy Durham will vote on which committees to focus on from 2018 -2021 at the April 18, 2018 Quarterly meeting. The P artnership will then begin creating a community health improvement plan (CHIP) to address the top priorities. Affordable Housing Affordable housing, as defined by HUD, requires no more than 30% of a family's monthly income. If a family spends more than 30% of income on housing they are less able to pay for other expenses such as food and health care. The increased cost burden of unaffordable housing adds to psychosocial stressors that can negatively impact a family.viii Renters make up 40% of households in Durham and almost half of them are defined as cost -burdened (i.e., paying more than 30% of their monthly income for housing).ix Top Responses from the Hispanic/Latino Neighborhood Sample Community Issues Health Problems Services Needing Improvement 1. Violent crime 1. Diabetes 1. Positive teen activities 2. Theft 2. Cancer 2. More health care providers serving Medicaid and uninsured populations 3. Substance use 3. Obesity/overweight 3. Affordable housing 2017 Durham County Health Priorities 1.Affordable Housing 2.Access to Healthcare and insurance 3.Poverty 4.Mental Health 5.Obesity, diabetes and food access 6 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Access to healthcare and health insurance Despite the number of low cost and free clinics in Durham County, there are still many Durham residents who have trouble accessing care when they need it. Barriers to obtaining health care can range issues with transportation, language barriers, or distrust of the healthcare system. According to the 2016 Community Health Assessment Survey, the top reasons identified by Durham County residents for why they or someone in their household could not access necessary healthcare included insurance didn't cover service, copay was too high, lack of insurance, couldn't get an appoi ntment, didn't know where to go and provider didn't take their insurance. These factors will have to be addressed in order for all Durham County residents to access the healthcare they need.x Poverty Poverty has a strong impact on health and is an important concern for Durham residents. Research now shows th at even the risk of an adverse change in material conditions - economic and housing insecurity, as well as un - or underinsured health insurance coverage - affect health outcomes. Reasons for the association between economic insecurity and health include th e health effects of stress resulting from economic insecurity, effects on food consumption of stress and spending limitations, and restricted use of health services.xi,xii Mental health Mental health and substance use disorders have indirect costs such as prevention, treatment, and recovery supports; but also indirect costs such as motor vehicle accidents; premature death; comorbid he unemployment; poverty; school difficulties; engagement with social service, juvenile justice, and criminal justice systems; homelessness; among other problems.xiii Obesity, diabetes and food access As of 2016, 65% of adults in the Piedmont region, which includes Durham, were overweight or obese.xiv Additionally, 12% of Durham high schoolers were obese as of 2014.xv Obesity is a strong \"Healthy citizens can be productive and have stable families. Housing, access to health care is critical.\" - Durham County resident, 2018 Community Health Assessment Prioritization survey \"...poverty is at the top of the list and that has a waterfall effect on the other areas - housing, food access, etc...\" - Durham County resident, 2018 Community Health Assessment Prioritization survey \"Mental health needs more accessibility. \" - Durham County resident, 2018 Community Health Assessment Prioritization survey 7 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment contributor to diabetes. In 2015, 14.1% of Durham County residents aged 18 years or older who received some level of care from Duke Health and/or Lincoln Community Health Center had diabetes.xvi Many diseases are linked to nutrition including overweight or obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and some cancers. Food i nsecurity, the state of being without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food has a large impact on a person's diet. It is estimated that 17.9% of Durham residents (51,710 people) are food insecure.xvii Emerging issues Each section of the document includes data on emerging issues, but additional issues facing Durham County in coming years include the lack of data for the LGTQ+ population, lack of affordable housing and widening inequality. Chapter 14 on LGBTQ+ issues wa s included for the first time in the 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment. In writing this chapter, the authors found very little local primary or secondary data for this population. Data that was used was mainly from a national or statewide perspective. Durham County needs to collect data on those who identify as LGBTQ+ to detect disparities and best meet the needs of this community. The 2018 Community Health Assessment Prioritization survey captured the feelings of Durham County residents about the widening inequality in Durham. Survey respondents listed several factors for this including jobs that don't pay a living wage, higher housing costs, gentrification and an overall increase in the cost of living. Several Durham residents stated that it is getting expensive to live in Durham. Coordinated efforts are needed to ensure Durham remains affordable for all residents. Conclusion and next steps The findings from this 2017 Community Health Assessment suggest that Durham is poised to become not on ly a City of Medicine but also a Community of Health . The work of the Partnership for a Healthy Durham , which is currently planning and implementing several far -reaching health initiatives, will be critical to bringing about this transition. The next step s are to: Allow a one -month period for Durham County residents to make comments on the substance of this report. Determine the committees the Partnership for a Healthy Durham will have 2018 -2021 to address the health priorities. Share findings with communi ty members and organizations throughout Durham County. \"Until healthy food is more affordable than fast food and junk food, we are unlikely to be able to sign ificantly affect the issues of obesity, diabetes, and food access .\" - Durham County resident, 2018 Community Health Assessment Prioritization survey 8 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Develop community health improvement plans to be submitted to the State of North Carolina by September 4, 2018. 9 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment References i North Carolina Division of Public Health.

CHAPTER 1 Introduction 10 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 1.01 Introduction Description of Durham County Spanning almost 300 square miles, Durham is a single -city county in the Piedmont region of North Carolina.i Approximately 85% of all Durham County residents live within the city limits of Durham. Durham's economic roots are in the tobacco and textile industries; the Duke family managed one of the world's largest corporations which included companies such as Amer ican Tobacco, Liggett & Meyers, R.J. Reynolds, and P. Lorillard. Historically, the African American community has been a driving force in the development of Durham in terms of business, education and health care. Some of the businesses best known include M &F Bank one of the nation's first African American owned and managed banks; North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, the largest and oldest African American owned Life Insurance Company; and North Carolina Central University the nation's first publicl y supported liberal arts college for African American s. The once thriving business and residential district was dubbed \"Black Wall Street.\" For many years, the city's prosperity depended on these industries, as well as the business generated by the \"Black Wall Street\". Following the collapse of the tobacco and textile industries, Durham has engaged in a community -driven revitalization in many sectors. Durham is now known as the City of Medicine, with healthcare as a major industry. Although Durham County i s rich in resources, disparities between racial/ethnic groups as well as between lower income and higher income residents remain. The demographics of Durham County residents have shifted dramatically over the last decade. Since 2000, Durham County's population has grown over 30% to 2 94,618 in 2016 .ii Estimates for 2016 show that non -Hispanic African American s and non-Hispanic whites make up similar proportions of Durham's population: 37.2% and 42 .0% respectively. Hispanics m ake up an estimated 13.3 % of the county population, and Native American, Asian, and other eth nicities make up the remaining 7. 5%.iii As in many cities, immigration has impacted Durham's population. The Hispanic population has more than doubled in the last 16 years (2000 -2016) from 17,039 to 39,257 .iv In 2016 the proportion of residents who spoke a language other than English at home was 19.0%.v Durham's vibrantly diverse community has a history of both faith -based and politically -oriented commun ity organizing, as well as ongoing multi -sector collaboration to improve health. The Partnership for a Healthy Durham grew out of a local government and community collaboration on health initiatives, and was formally organized in 2004. It is now a coalitio n of over 500 Courtesy of Durham County Visitor's Bureau CHAPTER 1 Introduction 11 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment community members and representatives of hospitals, universities, local government, scho ols, non-profit and f aith-based organizations. The Partnership for a Healthy Durham is responsible for the Community Health Assessment , sharing the result s, and holding the discussions that set health priorities for the community. A 201 7 study of health partnerships demonstrated that this well - respected coalition was one of the most -connected health partnership s in Durham.vi Overview A Community Health Assessment is a process by which community members gain an understanding of the health concerns that affect their county by collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information on community assets and needs. The process culminates in the selection of comm unity health priorities. The 201 7 assessment process included 358 resident surveys and three community listening sessions that involved 42 community members. This document was created as a collaboration among the Partnership for a Healthy Durham, the Durham County Department of Public Health, and Duke Health . Durham's community survey was carried out by 29 community and Partnership volunteers, and this Communit y Health Assessment has 95 authors. The next step is a strategic planning process to generate a three -year Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) for Durham County. The Partnership for a Healthy Durham Coordinator and Durham County led all activities of the assessment and the various stakeholders in the Partnership and across the community guided the process. The Partnership for a Healthy Durham is the certified Healthy Carolinians progra m in Durham County and was the h ealth work -group of the Durham Results -Based Accountability Initiative until this initiative ended in July 2011. For more information on the Partnership for a Healthy Durham, please visit www.healthydurham.org , Twitter or Facebook . The Community Health Assessment Writing Team, many of whom were Durham County Department of Public Health staff, Duke Health facul ty and staff , and community partners with expertise in specific areas, gathered and reviewed data and produced chapters for the Community Health Assessment report covering 1 4 areas: 1. Introduction 2. Community Priorities 3. Community Profile 4. Social, Economic, and Environmental Determinants of Health 5. Health Promotion 6. Chronic Disease 7. Reproductive Health 8. Communicable Disease 9. Injury and Violence 10. Oral Health 11. Environmental Health CHAPTER 1 Introduction 12 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment 12. Public Health Preparedness 13. Older Adults and People with Disabilities 14. LGBTQ+ Issues The many hours volunteered by the Community Health Assessment Team, Partnership for a Healthy Durham members, community volunteers as well as the input provided by hundreds of Durham County residents, have assured that this assessment presents an accurate picture of issues needing attention and provides a solid basi s for the community health improvement plan for our community for the next three years. Goals The primary goal of the 201 7 Community Health Assessment was to provide a comprehensive compilation of valid and reliable information about the health of the Durham community - and to do this in way to make it easy for members of the Durham community to access and understand the information. A secondary goal was to meet the standards related to Community Health Assessment established by (a) the North Carolina Local Health Department Accreditation Board and (b) the Governor's Task Force for Healthy Carolinians . The March 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment fulfills a requirement from the North Carolina State Division of Public Health to submit a comprehensive health assessment of the county every four years. Durham County Department of Public Health is required to meet these standards to become an accredite d Local Health Department. Another goal was to meet the new requirements of the Federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (health care reform), one of which requires hospital systems to conduct a Community Health Assessment every three years. T he Partnership for a Healthy Durham, Durham County Health Department and Duke Health , which includes Duke University Hospital and Duke Regional Hospital have collaborated to conduct the Community Health Assessment for years. To meet the federal requirement s, this and future Community Health Assessment s will be conducted every three years. Organization of Document There are 1 4 chapters, with a total of 48 topics. See the table of contents for a full listing of each topic covered in this Community Health Assessment . In each chapter, several health indicators are presented to better understand the context of the issue. Wherever possible, disaggregated data or data specific to sub -populations within Durham County (often racial/ethnic groups, age groups, or gender) is shown. This data is sometimes in the form of a percentage of the population with a certain characteristic or behavior, or a rate (i.e. the number of people per 1,000 persons who have that condition). Note the method of measurement and scale CHAPTER 1 Introduction 13 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment used - they are often different for each indicator. For more information about margin of error or actual raw numbers (rather than percentages or rates), please see the original data source. For context, Durham's rates are compared with those of the entire sta te of North Carolina. For this assessment Durham's rates are also compared with f ive North Carolina peer counties - Cumberland, Forsy th, Guilford, Mecklenburg and Wake. The majority of the sections follow a template intended to make the document consiste nt and easy to follow. However, some sections may include additional information or omit information based on the particular topic. In general, writers were asked to include an overview of the topic, any related Healthy North Carolina 2020 objectives, th e most critical and current secondary and primary data, disparities, gaps and emerging issues, recommended strategies to address the issue, and current initiatives and resources. References are at the end of each chapter.

Name of initiative, brief description, website and contact information. CHAPTER 1 Introduction 15 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Both primary data and secondary data are presented in this report. Primary data are data collected using the Durham County Departme nt of Public Health ( DCoDPH ) resources; secondary data are information collected and analyzed by other agencies . As an additional resource, the Partnership for a Healthy Durham keeps updated links to reports on Durham's health on a dedicated webpage (http://healthydurham.org/health -data). Primary data came from the following sources: 1. County Community Health Assessment Survey: This anonymous survey, conducted in October and November 2016 , used census data and Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) software to randomly select two samples of households in Durham County. In the first random sample, any household in Durham County was eligible to be selected . Only Latino and Hispanic residents w ere eligible to participate in the second random sample, and thus only households in census blo cks with more than 50% Hispanic or Latino residents according to the 2010 Census were eligible to be selected . More details about the sampling methods are provid ed in Chapter 2. 2. Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS): This biannual survey is anonymous and includes a random sample of middle and high schools in the Durham Public School system. Schools are randomly selected to participate. Data from the 2015 survey is inc luded in this document; the most recent survey was conducted in 2017, but data are not released from the CDC until the spring of 2018 and thus could not be analyzed in time to include in this document. 3. Community focus groups and listening sessions: Three listening sessions were held between November 2017 and March 2018. C ommunity members who participated in listening sessions and focus groups discussed health assessment findings and provided context and a richer picture of community needs and priorit ies in Durham County . Secondary data came from many sources: The most common secondary data sources included in this document were the American Community Survey, a survey conducted through the U.S. Census, and the North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics (SCHS) of the North Carolina Division of Public Health. The NC SCHS website (http://www.schs.state.nc.us/data/ ) contains a compilation of many health data, including: Vital statistics (births, deaths, fetal deaths, pregnancies, marriage, and divorce) The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (health behaviors and risk factors and self -reported disease information) Basic Automated Birth Yearbook (BABY Book - summary of infant and maternal characteristics, such as prenatal visits and birth weight) Cancer surveillance data North Carolina Hospital Discharge Data CHAPTER 1 Introduction 16 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Community Health Assessment Strengths and Opportunities The Community Health Assessment is an asset to DCoDPH and its partners, as it provides an opportunity to engage multiple agencies and organizations , as well as community members in identifying and evaluating health issues across the county . The purpose of the assessment process is to continually assess the health of the community, identify key health priorities according to community members, develop action plans to address priority areas , and ultimately improve the health of the community. At DCoDPH, we strive to make each assessment better than the last . This year, we are particularly proud of: The community involvement in our health assessment process from beginning to end. The result was a survey and overall assessment that reflects the wants and needs of people living and workin g in Durham County. o Community members and organizations were invited to help select survey questions and topics. Community members and partner agencies were approached at Partner Against Crime meetings, Ruritan Club meetings, End Poverty Durham meetings, P artnership for a Healthy Durham committees, bus stops, and via an online survey. o Volunteers from Durham and surrounding communities dedicated their time to surveying selected households door -to-door. o Survey results were presented back at meetings and eve nts to gain community perspective on the meaning of the data. o Community members and organizations helped write the report. Rather than having one or two people write the assessment, 95 people contributed to this document , providing content expertise and a rich, community perspective to health in Durham County . o An online survey and a convenience sample of residents at grocery stores, libraries, bus stops, and DCoDPH guests helped narrow down and select the top health priorities. The continued use of a random sample and to survey Durham 's Hispanic/Latino residents as well as the overall c ounty 's residents. Durham was the first county in North Carolina to conduct a random sample in neighborhoods with high proportions of Hispanic/Latino residents. Dedicating a separate sample to our Hispanic/Latino community continues to be an essential step in capturing the opinions and concerns of the Spanish speaking population in Durham. Too often communities make critical decisions without adequate information and input. This Community Health Assessment provides insights about the state of Durham's health and will contribute to an environment for change.

CHAPTER 2 Community Priorities 18 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 2.01 Community priorities Survey Methods Survey Development The survey development process for the 2017 Community Health Assessment (CHA) involved collaboration from multiple community organizations and community members. Prior to developing the survey, presentations were given at two Partners A gainst Crime (PAC) meetings in Durham County to gain insight and feedback on the types of questions and information community members would be most interested in learning through the CHA process. A SurveyM onkey\u00ae link was also sent to members of the Partner ship for a Healthy Durham to find out what information was most useful in the last CHA report and what topics would be most relevant to work being done in Durham County going forward. A large group of community organizations was also engaged through emai l and phone conversations regarding upcoming organizational survey needs. Feedback from the PACs, Partnership for a Healthy Durham, and community organizations informed the creation of a draft survey, which was then re -circulated for feedback and comments. The following organizations were included in this process: Alliance Behavioral Healthcare, the Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Commission (BPAC), Duke Division of Community Health, Durham Congregations in Action, Durham Parks and Recreation, Durham's Part nership for Children, El Centro Hispano, El Futuro, Inter Denominational Ministerial Alliance of Durham and Vicinity, Inter -neighborhood Council, LGBTQ Center of Durham, Neighborhood Improvement Services, Partners against Crime, and SHIFT NC. Sampling Me thods The Durham County Department of Public Health collaborated with the North Carolina Institute for Public Health (NCIPH) to draw samples for the survey. A two -stage cluster sampling methodology was used, which involves randomly selecting census blocks and a set of random interview starting points within the selected census blocks. Census blocks were selected with probability proportionate to population size, giving census blocks with the highest populations a greater chance of being selected. Two-stage cluster sampling was used to select both a full county sample, in which any census block in Durham County was eligible to be selected into the sample, and a high proportion Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample. In order to be eligible for inclusion in th e Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample, at least 50% of residents living in the census block must have been Hispanic or Latino. Data on population size and ethnicity were obtained from the 2010 Census. Thirty five census blocks and 245 households were selec ted to participate in the full county sample, while 20 census blocks and 210 households were selected for the high proportion Hispanic/Latino CHAPTER 2 Community Priorities 19 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment neighborhood sample. Maps for both samples are displayed below in Figure 2.01(a) and Figure 2.01(b) . Figure 2.01(a). Full county sample CHAPTER 2 Community Priorities 20 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Figure 2.01(b). High proportion Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample Survey Administration Volunteers were recruited from community organizations and universities in the Triangle to help administer the surveys for the full -county and Hispanic/Latino neighborhood samples. Prior to administering the surveys, two training sessions were held to prepare volunteers. The training included survey best practices, safety, cultural sensitivity, and a hands on component to familiarize the volunteers with the technology used to collect survey responses. Seventy three volunteers assisted with the full county sample over the course of 11 survey days and 29 volunteers helped with the Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample over the course of eight days. The surveys for both samples were administered between October 6, 2016 and November 15, 2016. Survey teams were sent out in teams of two and were instructed to begin at the randomly selected starting points. If no one answered the door or the survey was refused, volunteers were instructed to go to the next closest residence. This process continued until a survey was completed. Then, volunteers continued to the next randomly selected start point. CHAPTER 2 Community Priorities 21 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Eligibility Criteria In order to be eligible to participate in the survey, three criteria must have been met: 1) residents must have been 18 years or older; 2) residents must have lived in the selected house; and 3) residents must have been willing to take the survey. Survey Results Analysis Analysis was completed in SAS 9.4. Results were weighted to account for the sampling method to ensure that final results are generalizable to the sample population. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC) CASPER methodology was used to calculate sample weights. The methodology incorporates the total number of households in the sampling frame, the number of households in the census block, and the number of interviews collected in each census block. Weights were also used to calculate standard error for each proportion. There are 200 completed surveys included in the full county sample and 158 completed surveys in the Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample. The response rates rate w ere 54.1% and 68.7% in the full county and Hispanic/Latino neighborhood samples, respectively. Since the Hispanic/Latino sample was selected among neighborhoods with at least 50% or more Hispanic/Latino residents, the results can only be extrapolated to Hispanics and Latinos living in neighborhoods with high proportions of Hispanics and Latinos. The results cannot be generalized to all Hispanics and Latinos living in Durham County. Key Findings To learn what issues were most important to people living in Durham, the survey asked three questions of survey respondents: 1. Keeping in mind yourself and the people in your neighborhood, tell me the three community issues that have the greatest effect on quality of life in Durham County. 2. Keeping in mind yourself and the people in your neighborhood, tell me the three most important health problems, that is, diseases or conditions, in Durham County. 3. Which three services need the most improvement in your nei ghborhood or community? The top responses to these questions are shown in Table 2.01(a) below. Priorities identified in both samples are shaded in light gre en. The top health issues identified in the full county sample and the Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample were similar. Both samples selected obesity and overweight and diabetes as two of the top three issues. Substance use was named by both samples as a top community issue and affordable housing was named as a service needing improvement by both sampl es. CHAPTER 2 Community Priorities 22 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Table 2.01(a). Top Responses from the Full County Sample Community Issues Health Problems Services Needing Improvement 1. Substance use 1. Obesity/overweight 1. Higher paying employment 2. Discrimination and racism 2. Mental health 2. Sidewalks and bike lanes 3. Poverty 3. Diabetes 3. Affordable h ousing Table 2.01(b ). Top Responses from the Hispanic/Latino Neighborhood Sample Community Issues Health Problems Services Needing Improvement 1. Violent crime 1. Diabetes 1. Positive teen activities 2. Theft 2. Cancer 2. More health care providers serving Medicaid and uninsured populations 3. Substance use 3. Obesity/overweight 3. Affordable housing The findings in the tables above are similar to the results of the 2013 survey. Poverty, violent crime and discrimination were among the top three responses for top community issues in the samples from the last survey. The responses to the top health probl ems in 2013 and 2016 are also similar, with diabetes, obesity, and cancer showing up in the top three in both surveys. Last, in the services needing improvements, positive teen activities, higher paying employment, and affordable housing were among the top three in both surveys. In 2016, residents were asked what one thing would make Durham County a better place to live in an open ended question . Responses to this question largely mirrored the priorities identified above. Many respondents in the full county sample cited the need to reduce crime and violence and more interaction between people from different backgrounds. In the Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample, many respondents noted a need for better access to police without the fear of deportation and less discrimination and profiling as well as cleaner neighborhoods. Community Input Following the random sample conducted in the fall of 2016, a survey was distributed in English and Spanish online and in person in grocery stores, libraries, Durham County Department of Public Health clinics, and bus stations in an effort to narrow down priority health issues in Durham County in January and February 2018. A list of eleven topics were included in the survey including: access to healthcare and health in surance; affordable housing; cancer; community relationships with police; discrimination and racism; HIV and Sexually Transmitted Infections CHAPTER 2 Community Priorities 23 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment (STIs); mental health, obesity, diabetes and food access; poverty; substance use; violent crime; as well as a comme nt box for other responses. A total of 829 community members responded to the survey. The top issues selected by participants were affordable housing (70.9%), access to healthcare and health insurance (69.6%), poverty (59.8%), mental health (54.5%), and obesity, diabetes and food access (46.3%). Discrimination and racism was the sixth priority and will be included in the discussion of all five topics during the community input session that follow. There were three community input sessions held between Nov ember 2017 and March 2018 reaching 42 Durham County residents. The sessions were held at a public library and other community locations. At least four more community listening sessions with various community stakeholders are planned between March 6 and March 24, 2018, as well as at least one Spanish language session. The purpose of the sessions is to solicit community feedback on what the ideal state for each of the five aforementioned health priorities is, what barriers currently prevent community memb ers from achieving the ideal state, and what solutions would help overcome the barriers listed. Community members will be encouraged to consider systems level changes during the listening sessions. A qualitative analysis will be completed after the liste ning sessions are completed to capture community feedback and recommendations, which will be included in the action planning process under the umbrella of the Partnership for a Healthy Durham. The Partnership for a Healthy Durham will vote on which committees to focus on from 2018 -2021 at the April 18, 2018 Quarterly meeting. Tracking Progress: Healthy NC 2020 Objectives As Durham County continues to work on these priorities, it is important to track our progress. In general, progress can be assessed by comparing Healthy North Carolina 2020 objectives. Healthy North Carolina 2020 identifies the most important state health priorities and tracks progress on improving outcomes. i The table below compares current county level data with state 2017 Durham County Health Priorities 1.Affordable Housing 2.Access to Healthcare and insurance 3.Poverty 4.Mental Health 5.Obesity, diabetes and food access CHAPTER 2 Community Priorities 24 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment level data on each Healthy NC 2020 objective.

Durham has seen improvement in 19 of the 40 objectives since 2014, and is meeting the state goals in 12. Improvements have been made in nearly every priority area selected from the 2014 assessment, which included access to care, obesity and chronic illness, HIV and STIs, substance use and mental health, poverty, and education. Notably, the HIV rate in Durha m County has increased from 26.9 per 100,000 population in 2014 to 31.9 per 100,000 population in 2016. More work needs to be done to address the rising HIV incidence throughout the county. Please note that comparisons to the state should not be made when the years of data do not match for a particular measure, or when the data sources is not the same. Table 2.01(c).

Currently the population is approximately 52% female and 48% male.iii While Durham County's median age has increased slightly to 34.4 years old in 2015, compared to 33. 2 years old in 2010, it is still younger than the median ages in North Carolina (38.0 ) and the United States (37.6) . The figure below compares the age distribution of populations in Durham County, North Carolina, and the United States during 2011- 2015. Breakdown of Age, Durham County, North Carolina and the U.S. , 2011- 2015 Figure 3.01(a) : Breakdown of Age, Durham County, North Carolina, and the U.S., 2011-2015 iv According to Census estimates , there are approximately 250,000 LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) adults living in North Carolina, representing 3. 5% of the population. The state's LGBT population is ethnically diverse , consisting of 2 5% African American s and 1 2% Latino s. Among North Carolina counties, Durham has the second largest number of same- sex couples per 1,000 households.v The proportions of Durham County's racially and ethnically diverse population have been relatively stable over the past five years . In 2015, th e largest racial groups were White ( 121,493), Black or African American (107,085), and Hispanic or Latino ( 38,768) residents.vi Census data for Durham County depicting race are depicted in Figure 3.01 (b) Age groups United States North Carolina Durham CountyCHAPTER 3 Community Profile 37 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Durham County's population is more diverse than that of North Carolina or the U.S. The County has a greater proportion of African American residents (37.1%) than the state (21.2%) or the nation (12.3%). Durham County's Hispanic or Latino population (13.4%) is larger than the North Carolina population ( 8.8%), but smaller than the US population (17.1%). Over the next 20 years, the Hispanic/Latino population is projected to ex ceed 20% of the population. vii Out of every 20 Durham County residents, approximately 10 were born in North Carolina, seven were born in a diff erent state, and three were foreign -born. Durham's foreign -born portion (13. 8%) is almost the same as the national portion (13. 5%), and nearly twice the state's foreign -born portion (7.9%).viii Within the foreign -born population in Durham , a little over half (5 1.7%) were born in Latin America and more than one quarter (2 9.7%) were born in Asia. Almost a tenth ( 8.6%) of Durham County's foreign- born residents are from Africa, which is over twice the national portion (4.8%). These proportions are displayed in Figure 3.01(c) below.

About one in 10 residents (12.5%) speak Spanish at home. On average , one in 10 residents speak English less than \"very well\" , shown in Figure 3.01(d).x English fluency is especially low in foreign born residents, with over half (50.9%) speaking English less than \"very well.\"xi Overall, this makeup more closely represent s national statistics than North Carolina statistics. Since 2010, there has been very little change in these numbers. Durham County is home to an educated population. Two in three County residents have at least some college education, which is at least 10% above the state and national average (see figure 3.01(e)). Eighty -five point one percent of males and 89.5% of females have graduated with at least a high school diploma, or the equivalent. xii Educational Attainment among Residents over Age 25, 2011 -2015 Figure 3.01(e): Educational Attainment among Residents over Age 25, Durham County , North Carolina and the U.S., 2011-2015xiii 051015202530 Less than 9th grade9th to 12th grade, no diplomaHigh school graduate (includes equivalency)Some college, no degreeAssociate's degreeBachelor's degreeGraduate or professional degreePercent of Residents over Age 25 United States North Carolina Durham CountyLanguage Spoken in the Home , 2011 -2015 Figure 3.01(d) : Language Spoken in the Home, Durham County , North Carolina and the U .S., 20151 79.0 21.0 8.688.8 11.2 4.880.6 19.4 9.0 than EnglishSpeak English less than \"very well\"Percent of residents United States North Carolina Durham CountyCHAPTER 3 Community Profile 39 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment The unemployment rate in Durham County is 6.8% for the population 16 years old and over , a slight decrease from 8.2% in 20 10. Both rates are lower when compared to the national unemployment rates of 9.4% in 2015 and 7.9% in 2010. In Durham County, t he lowest rates of unemployment were observed in Asians (3.9%) and non- Hispanic Whites (4. 2%). Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders experienced the highest rates of unemployment at 38.8%, followed by American Indian/A laska Natives (13.8%) and African American s (11.1%).xiv Overall unemployment trends in Durham County, North Carolina and the United States are displayed in Figure 3.01(f).

CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 42 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 3.02 Immigrant and refugee health Overview In 2015, the estimated Durham County population was 288,817 , including U.S. born citizens and foreign born individuals .i A \"foreign born\" individual is anyone who is not a U.S. citizen at birth; this includes naturalized U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents (immigrants), temporary migrants (such as foreign students), humanitarian migrants (refugees and asylees), and unauthorized migrants . ii Secondary Data In Durham County, immigrants have helped grow the population as well as the local economy by starting families and opening new businesses . iii Table 3.02( a) compares immigrant characteristics between North Carolina and Du rham County. Characteristics of Immigrants in Durham County and North Carolina , 2011- 2015iv North Carolina Durham County Estimate Percent population 9,845,333 288,817 Native 9,087,312 92.3% in different Puerto Rico in US island areas abroad 3.02(a) Characteristics of Immigrants in Durham County and North Carolina, 2011-2015iv CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 43 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Relative to North Carolina, Durham County has a higher proportion of immigrants. The largest immigrant group in Durham County are Hispanics, an estimated 13.4% of the population.v Immigrant Health Health Services for Immigrants and the Uninsured in Durham County In North Carolina, eligible immigrants (all legal permanent residents who have had st atus for five years or more; persons who have been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty by a U.S. citizen or LPR spouse; or whose children have been battered by their U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident spouse (who have had such st atus for five years or more); refugees, asylees, victims of trafficking, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and persons granted withholding of deportation; veterans and active duty military personnel and their wives, surviving spouses and children; and p regnant women and minor children (under age 19), who have had lawful status for any length of time) can apply for Medicaid. Undocumented immigrants can get emergency care through Medicaid but must pay out -of-pocket expenses for non -emergency services. In Durham County, all uninsured persons (regardless of immigration status) can receive primary care at federally -funded health centers (FQHC) , including Lincoln Community Health Center (LCHC). vi LCHC has three satellite clinics distributed throughout the city of Durham ; Lyon Park Clinic, Walltown Neighborhood Clinic, and Holton Wellness Cente r, which are operated by the Duke University Division of Community Health . vii The majority of the LCHC -affiliated clinics have Spanish -speaking capacity. Additionally, t wo free clinics are available to the uninsured in Durham County, Healing with CAARE and Samaritan Health Center .viii,ix The uninsured can also receive care at some private clinics that provide services on a sliding scale. Uninsured Durham County residents who need specialty m edical care can also be referred by a LCHC provider to Project Access of Durham County, a program in which specialists donate their services to enrolled patients.x All county residents (regardless of immigration status) can also obtain free medical assessments and treatment for communicable diseases at the Durham County Department of Public Health. All uninsured residents are eligible to enroll in Local Access to Coo rdinated Healthcare (LATCH).xi LATCH is a Duke Health care management program with Spanish -speaking care managers that connects the uninsured to primary care, provides care management to Project Access of Durham County and Durham Homeless Care Transitions patients, and provides assistance with disability, medication, durable medical equipment, transportation, and Medicaid applications among other services . Refugee Health A refugee is someone who \" owing to a well -founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside of the country of his nationality and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country .\" An asyl um-seeker is \"someone who says he or she is a refugee, but whose claim has not yet been definitively evaluated.\" xii,xiii CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 44 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Refugees frequently have complex health care needs \" as a consequence of inequities in the social determinants of health: experiences of persecution, torture, and other forms of trauma, deprivation, unhealthy environmental conditions, and disrupted access to healthcare .\" xiv Two refugee resettlement agencies are headquartered in Durham: Church World Service (CWS) and World Relief . xv,xvi Both agencies provide case management, assistance to navigate the health care system, cultural orientation classes, English as a Second Language (ESL), employment, and employer training. Prevalence of Mental Health Distresses in Refugees Half of all re fugees have mental health concerns. The effect is higher healthcare costs, persistent and severe mental illness, and worse acculturation outcomes . xviiixvii Refugees suffer from the Triple Trauma Paradigm: 1) Trauma from country of origin (oppression, discriminatio n, targeting, torture); 2) Trauma in flight (leaving home & family, extreme travel conditions, victims of crime); and 3) Trauma in new country (social isolation, forced family separation, loss of social role, loss of family identity, community and culture , acculturation stress, and anti -immigrant attitudes .

It also does not capture all other populations eligible for refugee benefits and services such as Cuban parolees, asylees and trafficking victims. CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 45 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Primary Data Health priorities among Hispanic residents of Durham County In 2016, the Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey was conducted in Spanish with a random sample of households from census blocks that were more than 50% Hispanic in the 2010 census. xx Survey respondents were asked: Keeping in mind yourself and the people in your neighborhood, name the most important health problems (that is, diseases or conditions). The top 10 are given here. Top 10 Health Problems Identified among Hispanic/Latino Residents in Durham County, 2016 xx Figure 3.02(a) Top 10 Health Problems Identified among Hispanic/Latino Residents in Durham County, 2016xx Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues The legal, social and economic difficulties for immigrants , refugees and their families can differ widely and this can make accessing healthcare and health -related resources difficult. These are just some of the gaps and disparities that can make it problematic for immigrant groups and their families to access healthcare: Although eligible immigrants can apply for Medicaid, the undocumented are excluded from Medicaid and are barred from purchasing out -of-pocket private health insurance. Although any uninsured patient can seek care at Durham County safety -net clinics, these clinics require a sliding scale copay. Safety -net community clinics in Durham County do not provide specialty care. Project Access of Durham County connects uninsured county residents to donated specialty care and meets many of the needs of the uninsured, although this resource is limited. CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 46 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Insured or not, immigrant and refugee households still face language barriers, mistrust in government authorities, and other non- financial barriers that impede access to healthcare. U.S. born and lawful immigrant child ren of undocumented immigrants are eligible for all public programs, but still face barriers to healthcare due to concerns that undocumented family members might be identified and reported to immigration authorities as a result of their children's participation. Citizen children of immigrant parents (lawful or unlawful) are less likely to be enrolled in healthcare than their peers with citizen parents . xxi Compared to legal immigrants and citizens, undocumented- headed households are more likely to live in po verty and be uninsured, making health care less accessible. Limited English proficiency & functional illiteracy (verbal & written) is likely to affect the quality of care immigrants receive, patient safety and the ability to correctly fill -out paper work. One of the emerging issues in Durham County is the increasing amount of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC). The UAC are children intercepted in the United States, under 18 years old, with no lawful immigration status in the U.S., no parent or legal guardi an in the U.S., or, with no parent or legal guardian in the U.S. available to provide care or legal custody. Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) are referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) for placement by another Federal agency, usually the De partment of Homeland Security. Durham County was the third top destination county in North Carolina with 127 UAC placed Oct 1, 2016 - Jun 30, 2017. Recommended Strategies Community -building Strategies Improve service coordination and partnerships among stakeholders to comprehensively address the health needs of Low English Proficiency populations. This may include developing policies, improving hiring practices and working to develop an institutional culture that produces enhanced culturally sensitive, multilingual and welcoming services. Increase funding to community -based organizations that work with immigrant and refugee communities in the area of healthcare. Strategies to increase access to insurance and care Increase healthcare enrollment for eligible adults and children in immigrant and refugee households. Increase the availability of and use of affordable medical homes among undocumented immigrants.CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 47 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment References i PewResearch Hispanic Trends Project.

CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 49 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 3.03 Racial and ethnic disparities Overview The National Library of Medicine defines health disparities as \"the variation in rates of disease occurrence and disabilities between socioeconomic and/or geographically defined population groups.\"i In this case, the groups are defined by race and ethnicity. However, not all disparities are a direct result of these factors . The major resources that allow people to have better health include education, income, occupation, and wealth (assets), with educ ation and income levels being among the strongest predictors of health. When analyzing and discussing racial and ethnic disparities, one must consider access to these opportunities as a determinant of health outcomes. Groups that have historically been pushed to society's margins with inadequate access to key opportunities continue to be represented in the groups most heavily affected by these disparities. Structural racism, an indirect social determinant of health, must also be considered for a complet e analysis of disparities in health . Structural racism is defined as the \"system in which public policies, institutional practices, cultural representations, and other norms work in various, often reinforcing ways to perpetuate racial group inequity .\"ii The United States' history of c hattel slavery and Jim Crow Laws laid the foundation for many of the conditions people of color experience today. Laws that regulated v oting rights, defended low quality education, and justified discrimina tory housing practi ces have reappeared today as a lack of opportunity and increased stress that can worsen medical conditions. For example, African Americans and Hispanics are more likely than Whites to be living below the poverty level. While the poverty rate for the population as a whole was 13.5 % in 2015 , for African American s it was 24.1 %, Hispanics (of any race) were at 21.4% , Asian with 11.4% and Non -Hispan ic whites had the lowest rate of 9.1% .iii People living in poorer neighborhoods have higher stress leve ls, less access to resources, higher rates of unhealthy behaviors, and higher rates of early death . New research also suggests a link between the effects of structural racism on cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack.iv The goal of achieving health equity requires the increase of fair and just opportunities for everyone . This means improving living conditions, increasing access to resources a mongst other factors that strongly influence health outcomes . While h ealth equity and health disparities are closely related to each other , health equity is a human rights principle . Therefore, a decrease of d isparities in health and equitable access to key social determinants of health are valuable means by which to measure equity .v CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 50 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Durham County Population by Race , 2012 -2016 Figure 3.03 (a): Durham County Population by R ace, 2012 -2016vi Durham is a diverse county rich with ethnic and racial diversity . In fact, the majority of Durham is comprised of racial minorities . See Figure 3.03a for more information. Yet despite this diversity, ethnic and racial disparities in health exist. Maternal -child health is often a good indicator of a population's health. Younger maternal age has been linked to many poor health outcomes for children such as low birth weight , preterm birth, and failure to complete secondary school.vii Racial discrimination create s an additional risk factor for marginalized groups. Poverty, trouble doing well in school , and access to alcohol and drugs heighten the risk f or multiple problems for young women . Some of these problems include teenage pregnancy, substance use, and delinquent behavior. These outcomes have ripple effects as they may influence the growth and development of the unborn baby . Further downstream, these outcomes may ultimately influence life choices and opportunities. Some of these trends in maternal -child health are observable in Durham County. The greatest disparity in birth weight is seen among Black or African American newborns in Durham. These serve as example s of disparities in health early in a life cycle that may have everlasting implications. Non-Hispanic White, 42.0% Non-Hispanic Black, 37.2%Hispanic of any race, 13.3%Asian, 4.7%American Indian, Alaska Native, 0.3%Two or more races, 2.3% Other, 0.2%CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 51 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Figure 3.03 (c): Percent of Low Birthweight Live Births, Durham County, 2016viii The number of age-adjusted deaths per 100,000 p opulation is higher among non-Hispanic African American s compared to Whites, Hispanics and the overall population. (Figure 3.03d). Figure 3.03 (d): Age-Adjusted Mortality Rate by Race and Ethnicity, Durham County, 2012 -2016ix Cancer and heart disease are leading causes of death among many groups nationwide. A similar trend is seen in Durham: cancer is the leading cause of death and heart disease is the second leading cause of d eath among non -Hispanic Whites and non-Hispan ic Blacks, while diabetes makes the top 5 l ist for Hispanics (Table 3.03a). Many of the top five killers of Whites in Durham are chronic disease s which evolve over time and are the result of the complex interplay between genetics, the environment, and lifestyle choices.

As a general principle, to be effective , public health interventions s hould apply a racial equity lens to targeted , critical points in the lifecycle. For Durham, targeting the two extremes of the life cycle through a racial equity lens may be helpful. Common public health initiatives to reduce smoking, drunk driving, sexually transmitted infections, obesity and environmental exposures will always be important and should also continue . It is important to keep women and children healthy early on. Otherwise, children could be left playing \"catch -up\" for the rest of their lives. Addi tionally, w orking to lower the rate of unintended and/or teen pregnancies among minority women may lead to improved newborn outcomes. Centering Pregnancy is an evidence -based model for prenatal care in which pregnant women meet in groups throughout their pregnancy to receive prenatal health care. The Centering model has been shown to increase breastfeeding, decrease low birth weight and p reterm babies, and promote well - being throughout pregnancy and beyond .xi This or similar models should be implemented to improve the lives of women and their children. At the other end of the spectrum, resources aimed at causes of preventable death are par ticularly helpful. E ducation about safety and efforts aimed at reducing violence and crime, may help decrease preventable causes of death among people of color . Improved health equity will involve the action of removing obstacles to health and increas ing opportunities for everyone to be healthier , focusing especially on those who face the greatest barriers to optimal health . Including marginalized groups in identifying and addressing their health CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 53 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment equity goals, specific to their lived experiences and ex posure to racial discrimination , will be important to this process . It is hard to capture data about the prevalence and impact of structural racism , as it is hard to quantify within traditional scientific measurements . However, moving forward , data collect ion about perceived racism (as this influences mental health) and overt cases of prejudice , will be necessary to reverse and eliminate racial/ ethnic health disparities. Encouraging all sectors of the Partnership for a Healthy Durham to attend sponsored anti-racism trainings by the Racial Equity Institute, lays a foundation for approaching solutions with a \"racial equity lens .\" Interventions aimed at dismantling structural racism, which may seem unrelated to health at first glance, will improve the health and overall lives of People of Color in Durham County.

CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 55 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 3.04 Durham facts and history Durham Facts Durham County is in the Piedmont region of North Carolina, approximately 150 miles from the coast to the east and 170 miles from the Appalachian Mountains to the west. Durham is a 286 - square mile single -city county. The county is 25 miles long, 16 miles wi de and 28 miles from corner to corner. Durham is one of the most compact counties in North Carolina at one -half to one - third the land area of neighboring counties. It contains more than 96,000 acres of hardwood and evergreen forests including the only rema ining old growth Piedmont bottomland forests. i Durham is a county of neighborhoods. In 2016, the City of Durham counted 244 neighborhood associations. ii Durham is known as the City of Medicine, U.S.A. with healthcare a s a major industry. Durham includes more than 300 medical and health -related companies and medical practices with a combined payroll that exceeds $1.2 billion annually.iii In addition to Duke University and North Carolina Central University (NCCU), Durham also has the North Carolina School of Science & Math, Durham Technical Community College, many private schools, charter schools and Durham Public Schools, which is the eighth largest school district in the state with 33,151 students and 4,600 employees. iv,v Durham has two major corporate and research parks. Research Triangle Park (RTP) is a 7,000 - acre research and production district encompassed by the city of Durham. RTP accommodates more than 170 major research companies employing 39,000 full -time and 10,000 contract workers. Treyburn is a 5,300- acre corporate park, country club and residential area in northeast Durham. Treyburn houses several companies and is home to more than 100 families. vi History of Durhamvii Durham County has a rich and colorful history. Long before the Bull City was named for Dr. Bartlett Durham in the 1800's, Durham was home to two Native American tribes - the Eno and the Occaneechi. Durham is thought to be the site of an ancient Native Am erican village named Adshusheer. Additionally, the Great Indian Trading Path is traced through Durham. Native Americans helped mold Durham by establishing settlement sites, transportation routes and environmentally -friendly patterns of natural resource us e. The 1700's saw an influx of European settlers coming to Durham consisting of Scots, Irish and English colonists. During the period between the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, large plantations were established. By 1860, Stagville Plantation lay at the center of one of the largest plantation holdings in the South. There were free African American s in the area as well including several who fought in the Revolutionary War. In 1849, Dr. Bartlett Durham provided land for a railroad station. Due to a disagr eement between plantation owners and farmers, North Carolina was the last state to secede from the Union. Durhamites fought in several North Carolina regiments. Seventeen days after Lee CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 56 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment surrendered his army at Appomattox, Union General Sherman and Confeder ate General Johnston negotiated the largest surrender and the end of the Civil War at Bennett Place in Durham. Shortly after the Civil War, Brightleaf tobacco was discovered by locals. Washington Duke and his family took advantage of this discovery, spawn ing one of the world's largest corporations which included companies such as American Tobacco, Liggett & Meyers, R.J. Reynolds and P. Lorillard. Tobacco also inspired other Durham developments such as the first mill to produce denim and what was at one poi nt the world's largest hosiery maker. In 1887, Trinity College moved from Randolph County to Durham. Washington Duke and Julian Carr donated money and land to facilitate the move. Following a $40 million donation by Washington Duke's son, James Buchanan Duke, Trinity College was renamed Duke University in 1924. In 1910, Dr. James E. Shepard founded North Carolina Central University, the nation's first publicly supported liberal arts college for African American s. After the Civil War, the African American economy progressed through a combination of vocational training, jobs, land and business ownership and community leadership. In 1898, John Merrick founded North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, which today is the largest and oldest African American owned life insurance company in the nation. With its founding in 1907, M&F Bank became one of the nation's strongest African American owned and managed bank. So many other businesses joined these two in Durham's Parrish Street neighborhood that the area became famously known across the country as \"Black Wall Street.\" The Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People organized in 1935 by C.C. Spaulding and Dr. James E. Shepard, has been cited nationally for its role in the sit -in movements of the 1950s and 1960s. The committee has also used its voting strength to pursue social and economic rights for African American s and other ethnic groups. In the late 1950s, Reverend Douglas Moore, minister of Durham's Asbury Temple Methodist Church along with other r eligious and community leaders, pioneered sit -ins throughout North Carolina to protest discrimination at lunch counters that only served whites. A sit -in at a Woolworth's counter in Greensboro, NC, captured the nation's attention. Within days, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. met Reverend Moore in Durham where Dr. King coined his famous rallying cry of \"Fill up the jails,\" during a speech at White Rock Baptist Church. In the 1950s and 1960s, at what is now the world's largest university -related research park and vast Triangle region namesake was carved from Durham pinelands as a special Durham County tax district. Research Triangle Park is encompassed on three sides by the City of Durham with a small portion now spilling into Wake County toward Cary and Morrisville. RTP scientists have developed inventions from Astroturf\u00ae to HIV drug, AZT and won Nobel Prizes in the process. Currently, more than 170 RTP located major res earch and development companies including Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, IBM, Underwriters Laboratories and agencies such as the EPA employ more than 39,000. CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 57 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment In the early 1960s, Durham began building the Durham Freeway or Highway 147 to connect the relatively ne w RTP to downtown. The planned route was part of an urban renewal process to rebuild major city areas. Highway 147 cut through the middle of the African American Hayti community which extended along Fayetteville, Pettigrew and Pine streets.viii During th e early 20th century, the Hayti community was known for \"Black Wall Street\" as well as homes, churches and dozens of businesses such as a hotel and theater. Hayti was a thriving black business center and residential neighborhood. Activist and writer W.E.B. Dubois once commented on the success of Durham's black middle class in his often quoted 1912 article \"The Upbuilding of Black Durham.\" ix Highway 147 was completed in the late 1960s, separating the community and business districts. During construction of the expressway and following completion, residency in Hayti fell as residents moved to find jobs and housing due being displaced. Between 1970 and 1980, the population of Hayti was nearly cut in half. x Little remains today of the historic Hayti community, but it's legacy continues. In recent years, many of the buildings in downtown Durham that were once tobacco factories and warehouses have been converted into businesses and residences. The American Tobacco District, West Village and Brightleaf Square are all examples of such conversions. These developments have also led to the revitalization and beautification of Downtown Durham and Durham Central Park.

CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 59 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 3.05 Land use Overview Local government land use policies and regulations can profoundly impact the health and safety of a community. Safeguarding and promoting provision of efficient infrastructure, affordable housing, economic opportunity, healthcare, community cohesion, and safe and attractive neighborhoods, is among the local government's most crucial functions. i Primary Data Currently, approximately 46 percent of the land in Durham County is dedicated to non -residential land uses, including agricultural uses and land set aside as recreation/open space. Residential uses account for 28 percent and vacant land accounts for 25 percent (See Table 3.05a). A pproximately 38 percent of Durham County's land lies within the jurisdictions of the City of Durham and portions of the Town of Chapel Hill, Town of Morrisville, and City of Raleigh .

Household Income, Existing Land Use, Durham County, July 2017 CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 60 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Following decades of suburbanization and decline of the City of Durham's urban core, the past decade has seen a renaissance for downtown Durham and surrounding neighborhoods. Fortunately, much of Durham's rich architectural heritage is being preserved through creative reuse of many historical structures , eschewing demo lition and replacement. Particularly important has been conversion of former industrial properties, such as the American Tobacco campus and former Liggett -Meyer corporate headquarters and warehouses, to mixed -use and high -density residential within Durham' s historical urban core. The occupancy rate for office space in the downtown area is over 95 percent and new office construction is rushing to meet demand. Additionally, o ver 1,200 new high- density housing units have been added to Durham's housing stock, with several hundred additional units currently under construction. The influx of new residents has created a vibrant market that has resulted in a host of new businesses i n downtown Durham and creation of hundreds of service sector jobs. Durham's urban renaissance creates challenges as wel l as opportunities . Employment growth, as well as substantial suburban housing growth over that past two decades, has contributed to increasingly congested highways and thoroughfares . According to projection prepared by the Durham City -County Planning Department, Durham's population is expected to grow by almost 50 percent by 2045 and this presents a daunting transportation planning challenge. Durham's growth has also been accompanied by a decline in the percent of housing that is affordable to low - income households . Particularly challenged are households earning 60 percent or less than median household income (See Table 3 .05(b) ). The relative dearth in affordable housing options for service sector workers in the downtown area makes it difficult for these workers to find housing relatively clos e to their places of employment. T hus, these workers find it necessary to seek housing optio ns farther afield and commute longer and longer distances to their places of employment. This in turn adds to Durham's traffic congestion during peak travel hours.

Note: Affordability calculations are based on ACS data on \"monthly gross rent\" and \"monthly housing costs for owner -occupied housing with a mortgage.\" \"Affordable\" means \"affordable to a three -person household earning 60% of median household income in Durham Cou nty.\" CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 61 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Land Use Trends and Predictions Industrial, commercial, and office/institutional lands comprise approximately 11 percent of Durham County. These uses are Durham County's economic engine, generating approximately 243,000 jobs in 2015. Land use demand is largely a function of population and employment. The Durham City -County Planning Department has recently projected land use demand based on anticipated population and employment growth through the year 2045. The results are shown in Table 3.05(c) . Projections for Population , Key Employment Sectors , and Land Use Demand, Durham ; U.S. Office of Economic Analysis ; Durham County Tax Assessor. Recommended Strategies, Current Initiatives, and Activities Planning for a regional rail system connected Triangle communities and the Research Triangle Park continue s apace. The Federal Transit Administration recently granted permission to GoTriangle, the regional planning agency responsible for the Durham -Orange Light Rail Project , to begin the engineering phase for the rail system .ii The Durham City- County Planning Department's Comprehensive Planning and Urban Design team are currently working with other City and County departments, land developers, local housing non-profit organizations, and ot her community stakeholders to identify new strategies for provision of affordable housing, particularly in proximity to downtown Durham and future light rail and commuter rail stations. This initiative was undertaken in response to a resolution adopted by both Durham County and City o f Durham elected bodies in 2014. iii The Durham City -County Planning Department is the planning agency for both the City of Durham and Durham County. Planners develop long -range and special areas plans that contain policies to direct growth. Various plans address land use, open space, histori c resources, the environment, CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 62 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment housing, transportation, economic development, government services and facilities and Durham's diverse population. The City -County Planning Department maintains the Durham Comprehensive Plan , which is serves as Durham County's and the City of Durham's statement about how our community should grow and develop. The Durham Comprehensive Plan,iv in support of regional rail planning, designates a series of \"compact neighborhoods\" in the vicinity of planned transit stations. Recentl y, seven of these compact neighborhoods were rechristened as \"design districts.\" These districts will serve as transit, bicycle, and pedestrian -friendly support areas for transit hubs (See Figure 3.05a). Higher -density housing located within these areas wi ll provide opportunities for urban living conveniently close to, and efficiently served by, mass transit. Design district locations and future rail stations are shown in on Durham's adopted Future Land Use Map on the following page. (See Figure 3.05(a)) The Durham Comprehensive Plan was adopted by the Board of County Commissioners and the City Council in 2005 and is updated annually via the Planning Department's Evaluation and Assessment Report. v Additional adopted reports and plans on a variety of land use topics, including local historic district plans, open space plans, industrial land supply, and design districts, as well as manuals and guidelines for land use development in Durham, are avail able at http://durhamnc.gov/339/Adopted -Plans -Guidelines .

According to the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the built environment encompasses the buildings, spaces, and products created or modified by people. For example: buildings (housing, schools, workplaces); land use (industrial or residential); public resources (parks, museum s); zoning regulations; and transportation systems.i A community's design has a direct impact on where people live, where people work, how they get around, how much pollution they produce, what kind of environmental hazards they face, and what amenities t hey enjoy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , healthy places are those designed and built to improve the quality of life for all people who live, work, worship, learn, and play within their borders - where every person is free to make choices amid a variety of healthy, available, accessible, and affordable options.ii In communities with open green space and various types of destinations close to each other, it is easier for residents to incorporate physical activity into their dai ly routine. In addition, a transportation network that includes sidewalks, bike paths, safe intersections, crosswalks, and public transportation provide people with safe and convenient opportunities to be active. Creating environments that promote and make it convenient to be more physically active can lead to a significant improvement in people's health. In addition, the built environment impacts other environmental health factors, particularly air and water quality, as well as the likelihood of injury. C ommunities that promote alternative forms of transportation and provide safe places for people to walk and bike can encourage residents to safely use alternatives other than driving, thus reducing the amount of traffic congestion, noise, and air pollution caused by traffic. Primary Data The 201 6 Durham City and County Resident Survey found that residents are supportive of improving the conditions for walking and bicycling in Durham .iii Findings include the following; Greenways /trails are identified as the parks and recreation service that should receive the most empha sis over the next two years . Sidewalk maintenance is identified as number three on the list of city maintenance services that should receive the most emphasis over the nex t two years. CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 66 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Sidewalks and greenways/ trails are number three and four on the list of capital projects that respondents would be willing to pay higher taxes to support, behind streets and schools. Five-year estimates for 2012 to 2016 from the American Com munity Survey (U.S. Census) show the percent of commuters who walk and bicycle to work. In the City of Durham, 2.8 percent walk to work and 0.9 percent bike to work. In Durham County as a whole, 2.5 percent walk to work and 0.7 percent bike to work.iv Seco ndary Data The City of Durham has more than 575 miles of sidewalks.v In general, there are few sidewalks in Durham County outside t he City of Durham. A notable exception is Research Triangle Park, which has a network of walking paths and trails . The lack of sidewalks or even a grassy shoulder on rural roads means that county residents often have nowhere to walk. Roads in outside the City are maintained by the N.C. Department of Transportation , but that agency does not build or maintain sidewalk s. In 2000, there were no bike lanes in Durham. Since then, about 40 miles of bike lanes have been created .vi Bike lanes are typically included when major roadways are built or widened, and in some cases bike lanes can be striped when a road is repaved. Durham has about 29 miles of paved trails and greenways, with about 189 miles of planned trails and greenways.vii The American Tobacco Trail was completed in 2014, providing a 23 mile regional trail in Durham, Chatham, and Wake counti es. Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Both the City of Durham Strategic Plan and the Durham County Strategic Plan contain objectives related to health and the built environment .viii,ix One objective is to increase transportation choices and local and regional connectivity through increasing bus ridership, the number of bicycle and pedestrian facilities (sidewalks, bicycle lanes, off -road trails, intersection improvements, and other related amenities) , and enhancing real and perceived bicycle and pedestrian safety while increasing bicycle and pedestrian activity. Several compact neighborhood areas have been designated in the vicinity of proposed light rail and commuter rail stations in Durham. These are areas identified for high -density and intensity infill, redevelopment, and new development that integrate a mix of land uses through an urban fabric that includes enhanced bicycle and pedestrian facilities. Compact neighborhoods are expected to be be walkable and bikeable with an improved street -level experience.x The Triangle is one of the fastest growing regions in the county. Growth brings prosperity and new employment opportunities, but also adds congestion to our roadways. By provi ding a congestion free alternative, light rail will help manage future growth while creating vibrant, walkable communities and connecting residents to jobs, education, and healthcare. CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 67 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment The D urham -Orange Light Rail Transit Project is a 17.7 -mile project that will connect three major universities, three major medical facilities, and three of the top ten employers in the state (Duke University, UNC - Chapel Hill and UNC Health Care). The light rail will provide 18 stations, nine park-and-ride locations and connections to other transit services . The project is planned to be opened in 2028.xi Recommended Strategies The Durham Bike+Walk Implementation Plan identified and prioritized more than 450 miles of bicycle facility needs, more than 400 miles of sidewal k needs, and 480 intersection improvement needs .xii From these needs, 75 projects have been identified for implementation based on a data - driven prioritization process . However, the plan also recognizes that there is a need for bicycle and pedestrian facilities and improvements on many other streets in Durham beyond the 75 projects identified in the plan . What options are available for these streets? A number of other bicycle/pedestrian projects are currently funded and in various stages of development . In addition, the Bike+Hike Plan identifies a number of opportunities for bicycle and pedestrian improvements that are and will continue to be pursued, including the following: Reviewing the feasibility of providing b icycle lane s on streets that are bein g resurfaced. Requiring s idewalks as part of all new development . Coordinating with the Durham Parks and Recreation Department on trail construction and improving access to and from trails Coordinating with GoDurham and GoTriangle on bicycle/pedestrian improvements related to bus stops, the Durham -Orange Light Rail project, and other transit projects Adding bi cycle and p edestrian facilities to N.C. Department of Transportation road and intersection construction projects . Providing traffic calming interventions on neighborhood streets. Reviewing crash locations and information submitted by resident s to identify s afety impro vements on a case -by-case basis . Providing a s idewalk petition program that allows residents to request and share in the cost of sidewalk construction . CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 68 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Current Initiatives & Activities Bike Durham A coalition of individuals and organizations working for bicycle -friendly change in Durham. http://www.bikedurham.org The all -volunteer 501(c)(3) non -profit community bicycle project. Programming includes hands on repair skill share (helping you fix your bike), an earn -a-bike program (helping you get a bike), and mobile clinics. http://www.durhambikecoop.org/ The Durham Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Commission (BPAC) An appointed commission that advises City Council and County Commissioners on bicycle and pedestrian issues. There are four committees: Development R eview, Plan Implementation, Bike Plan Implementation, and Communications/Outreach. http:// www.bikewalkdurham.org Durham Bicycle Boulevards Advocacy group focused on developing a dedicated bicycle network of low-stress neighborhood streets. https://www.facebook.com/bicycleboulevards/ Durham Bike+Walk Implementation Plan The City of Durham's Transportation Department was adopted by the Durham City Council in June 2017. The plan combines the comprehensive bicycle and pedestrian plans into one document focused on implementation. http://durhamnc.gov/3092/BikeWalk -Plan-2017 Durham Healthy Mi le Trails The Partnership for a Healthy Durham has developed the Healthy Mile Trail program to encourage residents to walk in their neighborhoods. Healthy Mile Trails are one -mile marked loops that use existing neighborhood sidewalks. To date, five Healthy Mile Trails have been established, with more on the way. http://healthydurham.org/committees/obesity -and-chronic - illness -committee/healthy -mile-trails Durham Open Space and Trails Commission (DOST) An appointed body that seeks input from neighborhoods, citizens, and local nonprofits and makes recommendations to City Council and the County Commissioners about Ope n Space, Trails and Greenway s. www.durhamost.org CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 69 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Vision Zero Durham Vision Zero is a multi -national road traffic safety project, originating in Sweden but now being utilized by cities and states across the United States, including Durham.

CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 71 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 3.07 Parks and r ecreation Overview Access to recreational opportunities has a profound impact on both mental and physical health. Trails, playgrounds, open space, athletic fields and recreation centers all provide the opportunity for physical activity, intellectual stimulation and social interaction. The City of Durham Parks and Recreation Department (DPR) is well -respected in the community for its quality programming and responsiveness to the community's needs. The department's breadth of 68 program facilities and parks offers great access to gymnasiums, athletic fields, outdoor basketball, playgrounds, tennis courts, pools and trails. DPR became nationally accredited by the Commission for Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies (C APRA) in 2008 and is being considered for its second re- accreditation in 2018 . Accreditation validates to the public that DPR is a well -administered department that meets or exceeds national standards. The accreditation process identifies areas for improv ement within the department, by comparing DPR against national standards of best practices, which ultimately means improved services to Durham and its residents . There are 166 national ly accredited parks and recreation departments ; ten of those department s are in North Carolina. i DPR has won several state and national awards for its programming and partnerships . In 2017 DPR and Duke Health were recognized by the National Park and Recreation Center with the National Partnership Award for Bull City Fit, a u nique approach to treating youth with obesity. Secondary Data DPR operates seven recreation centers . Amenities of these facilities include: seven gymnasiums, five dance studios, two indoor pools, three fitness facilities and two indoor walking tracks. In addition, three outdoor pools are operated in the summer months. DPR registered programming reaches over 10 ,000 individuals (both adults and youth) annually with a variety of offerings including athletics, fitness, outdoor recreation, dance, martial arts and programs for mature adults . ii DPR reaches many more residents through \" drop- in\" programming such as o pen gym, swim programs , festivals and other programs that do not require registration. Durham has approximately 30 miles of accessible trails and greenways with approximately 178 miles of planned trails and greenways .iii Additionally, several trails in Durham provide key linkage of the North Carolina Mountains to Sea Trail. Snapshot: Durham Parks and Recreation 68 parks with 1,800 acres 30 miles of trails 11 program sites o 7 gymnasiums o 5 dance studios o 2 indoor pools o 3 outdoor pools o 2 fitness facilities o 2 indoor walking tracks CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 72 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment DPR offers several classes on healthy cooking and eating for adults and children as well as after - school and summer c are programs for youth ages five to 17 years old. After -school and summer camp programs provide safe, healthy and affordable programming during the times children and youth are not in school. A s liding fee scale is available for those families who may have difficulty affording after school and summer d ay camp program fees. In 2016, 7 8% of the children attending summer day camp received some level of discount.iv Other programming offered by DPR includes care and recreational programming for per sons with disabilities , programming for mature adults, parent -child programming, teen outreach programming, environmental education, outdoor adventure programming and cultural programming. Primary Data In 2012, DPR worked with the National Research Cente r, Inc. to conduct The Parks and Recreation Community Survey (PARCS) in Durham. The PARCS provides \"...an in -depth sounding of residents' attitudes about community park, recreation and leisure services.\"v Residents were asked to rate the i mportance of 10 broad overall priorities that they believe are most important for DPR. The chart below illustrates that opportunities for health and wellness is a high priority for Durham residents. The data consistently indicates that a fitness/training facility and pr ogramming are rated as \"Essential\" or \"Very Important.\" Community Ranked Parks and Recreation Priorities , Durham County, 2012 Figure 3.07(a): Community Ranked Parks and Recreation Priorities, Durham County, 2012vi 93 92 90 9087 75 74 746966 0102030405060708090100PercentResident Ranking of DPR PrioritiesCHAPTER 3 Community Profile 73 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Seventy -six percent of respondent households cited a \"Fitness/training facility with a walkin g track \" as Essential or Very Important in a new recreation center; thirty -three percent ranked this amenity as most important .vii The Durham Parks and Recreation Master Plan 2013 -2023 provides the guidepost by which the City of Durham makes decisions about the location and development of new parks and facilities , as well as the renovation and repurposing of existing facilities.viii The plan addresses parks , centers and trails , programmin g and events , maintenance , and organizational structure. Residents indicate in the 201 6 Community Health Assessment Survey that they exercise or engage in physical activity most often at home and in their neighborhood.ix Given that parks and recreation centers play a significant role in the physical activity of the community , access to recreational programming and facilities plays a critical role in the health and well -being of Durham residents . The data collected in the Master Planning process by DPR co nfirms this finding. While delving deeper into this sentiment , the Master Plan Steering Committee learned that residents want more connecting trails between neighborhoods and parks and between parks.x Preferred Location for Physical Exercise, Durham County, 2016 Figure 3.07(b) : Preferred Location for Physical Exercise, Durham County, 2016xi Interpretations: Disparities, gaps, emerging issues Gaps in a ccess to DPR facilities and programs are largely due to program cost and lack of transportation. A lthough DPR strives to make its programs as affordable as possible, m ost recreational programming has some level of fee associated with it. DPR has established a discount card for community members to use at any of the recreation facilities to help alleviate some of this cost. For a minimal fee, a Play More Card can be purchased to allow for discounted lap swim, fitness classes, and other DPR programming. In addition to the sliding fee scale available for DPR child care programs, DPR also has a fee waiver program for families receiving support through the Department of Social Services. Families who qualify do not have to pay registration 46.142.6 41.5 23.021.0 10.56.54.21.6 1.3 1.0 05101520253035404550PercentCHAPTER 3 Community Profile 74 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment fees to participate in DPR programming. All DPR programming offers limited spaces for fee waiver registrants. DPR is piloting a transportation program for children attending select after school programs. The city is hopeful that if successful, this transportation service can be scaled to serve all of DPR after school sites. Residents living outside of city limits have to drive far to participate in DPR programs, decreasing the likelihood of utilization . Although s ome parks, trails and facilities are on current Go Durham bus route s, getting to these places requires considerable effort and time on the part of the individual . This creates an obstacle to accessibility for those who rely on public transit. Lastly, t here are some instances of demand being higher than the capacity of the agency. This is especially true for programming for youth with disabilities and care programs for children and youth during the summer months. Recommended Strategies Continued vigilance is needed in the promotion of DPR programming and facilities to the community. It is important to continue sliding scale fees for DPR p rograms in efforts to reach residents from all socioeconomic backgrounds. In order to become more accessible for all residents countywide, DPR programs and facilities need to expand into the more rural areas of the county. Finally , an alternate form of transportation to DPR activities for those utilizing Durham public transportation is recommended. Current Initiatives & Activities DPR Strategic Plan The newly updated Mission and Strategic Plan indicate that DPR's programmatic focus has shifted to promotion and support for greater wellness activities. The mission: Playmore: connecting our whole community to wellness, the outdoors and lifelong learning positions DPR as a primary resource for learning and maintaining a healthy lifestyle in Durham. The inclusion of the outdoors in the DPR mission contributes to the social, mental and environmental health of Durham . xii New initiatives are in process to serve this revised mission: The My Durham program offers continuous and responsive programming to youth ages 13-18, Monday - Friday from 3:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m. Weekly programs change regularly but always include fitness options. All Play is a new initiative to upgrade select parks and trails with fitness equipment for whole family. There is a significant push to move the planned trails for Durham to completion. Current estimates will increase built trail mileage by approximately seven m iles by 2023 with the completion of four new multi -use (bicycle and pedestrian) trails connecting neighborhoods to parks, schools, and commercial districts. CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 75 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment The Partnership for a Healthy Durham's Healthy Mile Trail program is expanding . DPR will identif y and mark paved walki ng circuits in parks beginning in spring of 2018.

CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 77 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 3.08 Faith and spirituality Overview Institutions of faith are integral elements of every community. They often are the places m any seek for safety, comfort and refuge. In faith communities people often find a network of encouragement, hope and many other resources. Health and healing have been important components of religions. Most stress the importance of paying attention to health, caring for the sick and making pos itive behavioral choices. A growing number of faith communities have incorporated health aspects into their programs and outreach. Often, health is addressed through organized groups such as a health committee or ministry. Such groups within the faith i nstitutions focus on the health and healing needs of the members and its extended community. Faith -based organizations have the potential to create healthy environments, increase access to healthy foods and drinks, increase access to physical activity a nd most of all provide spiritual and social support. Often located within the heart of communities, they are already sites where people congregate. Th is alone provide s an opportunity to communicate messages of health and well -being as well as to connect with families across generational lines. Primary Data Faith -based organizations are often a trusted source for community members. Although there are numerous sources to receive health information, church was amongst the choices respondents gave in the 2 016 Community Health Assessment Survey. When asked if a friend or family member needed counseling for a mental health or drug/alcohol abuse problem, \"religious official\" was selected by 27 .0% of the full county sample and 6 .2% of the Hispanic and Latino neighborhood sample. i Top Choices for Mental Health and Drug/Alcohol Counseling, Full County Durham County Sample, 2016 Figure 3.08(a): Top Choices for Mental Health and Drug/Alcohol Counseling, Full County Durham County Sample, 2016i 32.628.9 27.6 27.0 26.3 16.1 05101520253035 Private CounselorFamily/Friends Support group Religious OfficialDoctor Community agencyPercentageCHAPTER 3 Community Profile 78 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment In the 2016 Community Health Assessment Survey, w hen asked \"if you couldn't remain in your home, where would you go in a community -wide emergency\" , faith community/church remained in the top five responses in both the full county sample and the Hispanic/La tino neighborhood sample.ii Seco ndary Data Durham has more than 350 faith communities , includ ing at least 15 denominations. Directories exist to attract visitors to organizations but are often not a database. Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Durham's close proximity to local universities has proven to be both beneficial and an area of concern. While research has been helpful to gain knowledge, it has also been a source of contention with jeopardizing the trust of community members once the research has been completed. Unfortunately, faith -based organizations are often one of the first sources sought to reach community members for research studies and to implement behavior change programs. Many faith-based organizations in Durham approach health through a dedicated faith leader or health ministry. However, there are a few organizations that may have a staffed parish nurse who performs duties such as visiting the homebound or sick, providing support and monitoring individual concerns or needs. This position may work alongside a health ministry which provides activitie s encouraging healthy lifestyles through awareness, education and prevention. The presence of a trained parish nurse increased during the late 1990s through programs offered by Duke University with various training programs and resources, but a decline occurred within a span of ten years due to funding . iii Trends Over the last decade, Durham has seen a growing number of multisite and mega church organizations. Nationwide, m ultisite and mega churches are on the rise, becoming a new normal. A multisite church is one organization that meets in two or more different locations. A mega church has an average of 2000 participants in regular weekend attendance. It is believed that roughly one third of mega churches are non-denominational.iv Multisite churches are becoming more and more common. According to Christianity Today, multisite churches now number more than 5,000 nationwide and growing.v Previously, expansion meant that an organization's building was at capacity and no longer able to hold those attend ing weekly services. As a result, many have moved to multiple services within the same building but offered numerous times throughout the day. Today, even smaller faith- based organizations have expanded to multiple sites sometimes within the same town wh ile others spread into neighboring communities. This creates a challenge with regard to the social bond of attendees and places a strain on resources such as services and activities offered by leadership and health ministries. CHAPTER 3 Community Profile 79 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Also trending is the rise in the use of video streaming, sermon broadcasts and the delivery of service through satellite affiliates . Single leadership positions stream or televise the sermon and at other times, such sites require multiple leadership positions. Although the reach may be greater, there can be a disconnect in relationships with leadership and other members. Although very little research exists that identifies reasons for shifts, comparison data in Figure 3.08(b) does indicate a rise in non -denominational affiliation over a seven year period.vi The support for this data is visible when looking at the landscape of faith -based organizations that exist in Durham County, especially with regard to mega and multisite location s that may not have existed in the last decade. Nondenominational Affiliation, North Carolina Figure 3.08(b): Nondenominational Affiliation, North Carolinavi Recommended Strategies Many community approaches and evidence- based strategies can be modified for use with faith - based organizations. However, t he best strategies involve collaborative efforts between faith- based, community and service organizations such the Durham County Department of Public Health, Cooperative Extension and local medical facilities. Building partnerships with religi ous organizations and facilitating the development of health ministries within them is an excellent example of a mission -driven strategy that contributes to the building of healthy communities . Faith-based partnerships have the po tential to spread health information, actively manage chronic diseases, and encourage appropriate diagnostic screenings, support, and management. Thus, | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment are great examples of expanding preventive and awareness strategies to chronic diseases and injury prevent ion. Current Initiatives & Activities Durham County Health Ministry Network Develop s, support s and connect s health ministries in faith -based organizations located in Durham. Representatives from faith -based organizations meet quarterly to network, share resources and participate in skills -building trainings to include grant writing, developing exercise opportunities, developing policies and healthy eating activities. http://www.durhamhealthministry.org Partners in Health & Wholeness An initiative designed to bridge issues of faith and health.

In the social context, poverty is a relative measure of income inequality. Education, occupation, income, and assets are a set of factors used to measure socioeconomic status (SES).ii A low SES is commonly tied to poverty, which results in marked health disparities and poorer health outcomes compared to populations with higher levels of SES. Discussions in health policy primarily focus on access to health care (health insurance) and individual health behaviors (health promotion), however, material factors such as substandard housing, food insecurity, and unemployment all affect health as well. The median annual household income in Durham County, North Carolina is $52,503 and $53,889 nationally. iii,iv Figure 4.01(a) illustrates the proportion of residents in each income bracket for 2011- 2015 in Durham County and the United States .

Research now shows that even the risk of an adverse change in material conditions - economic and housing insecurity, as well as un - or underinsured health insurance coverage - affect health outcomes. Reasons for the association between economic insecurity and health include the health effects of stress resulting from economic insecurity, effects on food consumption of stress and spending limitations, and restricted use of health services. iv,v Multiple household moves, for example, are associated with poor child health and developmental risks.vi Adverse health events can heighten economic insecurity because of the drain on financial resources resulting from out - of-pocket medical costs, other health -related expenses, and the impact of illness on employment. Even those who are insured may be underi nsured, meaning that, due to cost of premiums, deductibles, and co -pays, they are still at high risk for substantial out -of-pocket health care costs. In 2014, 31 million Americans were underinsured in the United States.vii Below, the four dimensions of economic insecurity in Durham County are highlighted : unemployment or underemployment, housing insecurity, lack of or inadequate health insurance, and cost of living. Unemployment, labor underutilization, and wage trends Table 4.01(a). Unemployment Rate, Durham -Chapel Hill Metro Area and North Carolina , August 2017 viii,ix Unemployment rate (%) Net change from 07/ 16 Durham -Chapel Hill Metro Area 4.0 -0.8% North Carolina (seasonally adjusted) 4.1 -1.0% After a significant jump in the last decade, the unemployment rate in Durham has dropped to 4%, which is nearly the same as the rate observed statewide. viii,ix Current projections predict an ongoing increase in employment in North Carolina outpacing popula tion growth. Another key consideration is labor underutilization - the sum of people who are unemployed, employed only part-time for economic reasons, and marginally attached to the labor force.x Unemployment and labor underutilization rates have dropped and are projected to continue to decline. The proportion of Durham residents in either designation represents tens of thousands and significantly impacts the county as a whole. Housing Housing insecurity, economic insecurity associated with housing costs, and homelessness are all significant issues in Durham. In 2016, 39.4% of residents from the Durham City and County CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 86 | 2017 Durham County Comm unity Health Assessment Resident Survey reported that they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied wit h the availability of affordable housing in Durham.xii A breakdown of residents paying mortgages or rent in excess of 30% of income by income level is displayed in Table 4.01( b). Table 4.01(b). Proportion with monthly housing costs of 30% or more in past 12 months , Durham County, 2016xi Income Level Owner Occupied Renter of homes in Durham County are owner -occupied and the remaining 46.3% are renter -occupied.xi As expected, the majority of residents with low incomes rent, while very few residents with high household incomes rent. Figure 4.01(b) below depicts the proportion of households who rent and own the home they live in by income in Durham County during 2011 - 2015. Figure 4.01(b). Income and Residence Type in Durham County, 2015xi Health insurance During 2011- 2015, 16.7% of non -elderly individuals in Durham County were uninsured, including 4,716 children, or 7.4% of those aged 18 and under . xi North Carolina's 2011- 2015 statistics show a decrease of 1.3 percentage points in the proportion of the non- elderly population tha t was uninsured compared to estimates from 2008 -2012.xi The decrease was experienced across almost 0%2%4%6%8%10%12% Owner occupied Renter occupied CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 87 | 2017 Durham County Comm unity Health Assessment all racial and ethnic groups with the exception of white and Native Hawaiians.xi This decrease in the proportion of uninsured residents may have been impacted by t he Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, meaning that repeal of the act would threaten gains in the state's insurance rates. An important unknown for the quality of public insurance in North Carolina is potential changes to Medicaid at b oth the federal and state levels. Most notably, the federal government is currently reviewing a proposal to change the state's Medicaid program from fee- for-service to managed care. Toxic Stress According to the National Scientific Council on the Develop ing Child, toxic stress can occur when a child experiences \"strong, frequent, and/or prolonged adversity without adequate adult support.\" The over activity of stress -induced responses at an early age can disrupt the development of a child's brain and negat ively impact their health outcomes for the future. The impacts of these conditions are exacerbated when the resources available to caretakers and/or the community are underprepared to support the many needs of the children who are living in this perpetual state of toxicity . xiii The term used to describe overstressed conditions are referred to as Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). ACEs are qualified under three categories: abuse (physical, sexual, and emotional), neglect (physical and emotional), and hous ehold dysfunction (witnessing a caretaker managing severe mental illness, caregiver under incarceration, witness to domestic abuse, witness to substance abuse, and divorce or separation). xiv Harvard scholars have found that over time, chronic stress can di srupt development of the brain and increase the risk of stress -related disease well into their adult years. Adulthood chronic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease have been linked to exposure to ACEs in childhood. The positive correlation between ACEs and low -wealth is echoed throughout research. Also heavily documented is the correlation between gaps in wealth and race. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, deep poverty is defined as living in a household with incom e at less than 50% of the poverty threshold. In Durham County , 8.7% of residents were living in deep poverty and 11.4% of children in Durham County were living in deep poverty . xv Financial insecurity contributes to ACEs, thus indicating that these children may be experiencing at least one or more ACEs that could negatively impact them for a lifetime. The prevalence of low -income is higher in single - income households which are also more likely to be led by African American and Hispanic/Latino women. In Durha m County, children of single -led households are almost eight times more likely to experience extreme poverty than children of married couples as illustrated in Table 4.01(c ). CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 88 | 2017 Durham County Comm unity Health Assessment Table 4.01(c). Families whose Income in the Past 12 Months were Below the Poverty L evel, Durham County, 2011- 2015 xv All Families 12.7% With related children of the household under 18 years 20.6% Married Couple Families 5.1% With related children of the household under 18 years 8.2% Families with female household lead, no husband present 30.4% With related children under 18 years 38.5% Household interventions are one way to thwart the proliferation of these conditions, but the environment both within the household and community predetermine the likelihood of a child's exposure to ACEs. The causal relationship between barriers such as racial discrimination, lower wages received by women, and social disenfranchisement of formerly incarcerated men can account for some of the inequities in wealth but all of these in dicators directly affect a caretaker's capacity to meet the needs of their dependents. Under the burden of these stressors, it is less likely that caretakers will be able to stretch themselves enough to care for themselves, disrupt these systems, and effec tively meet the needs of children experiencing toxic stress. Access to community resources available from trauma- informed service providers has the potential to dramatically reduce ACEs as a determinant of health in adulthood.

Accessed November 20, 4 Determinants of Health 90 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 4.02 Homelessness and housing Overview Affordable and safe housing is critical to Durham residents' health. Housing is inextricably linked to nourishment, self-care, well -being, and recuperation from illness. As homeless Durham resident with a chronic illness said : \"I don't need a big place, just one with a medicine cabinet for my pills so I can keep track of them and be healthy .\"i Housing is a healthcare intervention having a direct impact on quality of life, health, and life expectancy. Unhoused persons are three to four times more likely to die than their housed counterparts. The disproportionate risk of death is particularly striking for men and women under 50.ii,iii Homelessness Homeless persons are enumerated though a process known as the Point -in-Time (PIT) Count that comprises physically counting all persons experiencing homelessness in a designated 24 -hour period annually . Since it is difficult to reach all people experiencing homelessness, PIT data are considered low and rough estimates of the actual homeless population.iv Much of the government funding for homeless services comes from U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) throu gh regional homeless services governing bodies known as Continuums of Care (CoC). In N orth Carolina , the North Carolina Coalition to End Homelessness (NCCEH) compiles and maintains CoC . The data from similar organizations in all states are then combined to determine the total homeless population in the United States. In Durham there are a number of agencies that work to address homelessness. The Durham Department of Community Development houses the Durham Opening Doors program which is Durha m's C oC. The CoC submits grants to HUD on behalf of Durham thereby generating funding for homeless services. In 2017 , there were 1.27 million dollars of HUD funding available to Durham through the C oC process . The Homeless Services Advisory Committee (HSAC) serves as the board of the C oC, advis es the Durham City Council and the Board of County Commissioners, and leads efforts to address homelessness in Durham. The HSAC membership is diverse and includes elected officials, non -profit agencies, and formerly homeless individuals. The HUD definition of homelessness includes residing in places not intended for human habitation (e.g., tent, vehicle) but excludes \"couch homeless\" or \"c ouch surfing .\" HUD funded housing requires use of the HUD definition and prioritize s available housing for people who are chronically homeless. In Durham , the prioritization process includes use of a standardized assessment tool, the vulnera bility index service prioritization decision assistance tool ( VI-SPDAT ), to create a n unbiased, fair, and transparent process. Federally funded non -housing services for people experiencing homelessness who do not meet the HUD definition are available through Durham Public Schools and the Lincoln Community Health Center Healthcare for the Homeless Clinic . CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 91 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Housing Quality and Affordability Poor housing quality has a direct impact on a health.v Housing improvements (e.g., pest control, plumbing and appliance repairs) can h ave an immediate impact on improving health.vi The Durham City Council has set out clear definitions of standards for housing quality, fines for violations, and authorizes the city inspectors to monitor housing quality issues. Durham's Neighborhood Improvement Services Department enforces the housing code and has inspectors available to provide support to n eighbors and tenants as needed. An innovative partnership between Duke Law students and children's medical providers provides legal representation for parents of children whose health is negatively impacted by substandard rental housing. Affordable housing , as defined by HUD , requires no more than 30% of a family's monthly income . If a family spends more than 30% of income on housing they are less able to pay for other expenses such as food and health care. The increased cost burden of unaffordable housing adds to psychosocial stressors that can negatively impact a family .vii Afford ability (or lack of it) often necessitates relocation as a family searches for less expensive rental options . Frequent moves are associated with a substantial decrease in high school graduation rates .viii Primary Data In the 2016 representative county sample of Durham residents surveyed as part of the Community Health Assessment , two of the top five items of concern related to housing as shown in Figure 4.02(a) . Figure 4.02(a ): Top community issues with the greatest effect on quality of life in Durham Six percent of the sampled residents r eported a history of eviction. When asked about services needed in Durham to improve quality of life for people over 60 respondents selected housing as a priority area (39% of the full sample and 5 2% of the Hispanic sample). Seco ndary Data In the five year period from 2011 - 2015, homeless ness decreased by 11.2% nationwide and 17.2% in North Carol ina but increased by 25% in Durham.ix,x In 2016, the nationwide and NC downward trends continued and Durham demonstrated a substantial 130% drop (from 813 in 2015 to 354 in CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 92 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment 2016).x This precipitous decline resulted from the Durham CoC no longer including Durham Rescue Mission residents in the total homeless count . The 354 number held steady in 2017, however a greater percentage of homeless people were unsheltered .x It will take several years of data collection following the 2016 change to identify new trends in total homeless persons. U.S. Census Bureau demonstrate s housing units in Durham have increased over time . The median gross rent was $895 on the 2011 -2015 survey and the median mortgage $1,404. Almost a quarter of the Durham population had lived in a different household in the previous year.xi Renters make up 40% of households in Durham and almost half of them are defined as cost -burdened (i.e., paying more than 30% of their monthly income for housing ).xii The percentage of renters paying more than is defined as affordable in rent is unchanged from 2006 -2010 but the rental vacancy rate has decreased from 9% at that time to 6% in the 2011 -2015 report. Fair market rent information from HUD uses local rental in formation to identify the dollar amount to be paid for housing vouchers on the open market .xiii In Durham , fair market rate has increased for all size apartments at approximately 5% but at a rate of 11% for efficiency apartments .xiv Durham has two emergency shelters that participate in the CoC; Urban Ministries of Durham (UMD) and Families Moving Forward (FMF). UMD has 149 beds and 25 overflow mats that supplement the bed space when needed, especially during severe weather . In 2015 -2016, UMD provided 899 people with emergency shelter while 189 people connected to permanent housing through their time at the shelter .xv FMF , founded in 2016 from the merger of Genesis Home and Durham Interfaith Hospitality Network, can serve up to 21 families at a time for up to three months each. In sum, they serve 80 - 100 families, including 180 children, per year. In 2015 -2016, FMF provided shelter to 67 families and 79% moved into permanent housing on exit .xvi Durham Housing Authority (DHA) is a source of affordable housing for low income renters . DHA owns properties and manages a voucher program (commonly known as Section 8 or housing choice vouchers) which pays fair market rate for units on the open market. There are more than 1800 public h ousing units owned by DHA . There are currently 2,791 active Housing Choice Vouchers . Renters using their own funds or receiving support through housing choice vouchers may face eviction if they fall behind on rent . Durham has an average of 887 eviction f ilings per month which is the highest rate among North Carolina's ten largest counties.xvii Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Durham has an affordable housing crisis . The increased interest in downtown living has created an escalation of rent in previously affordable areas. The federal minimum wage ($7.25 since 2009) and state law ( HB2 ) enacted in 2016 limits the ability of a city to set a pay standard for private employ ers. Given the link between wages and access to housing these exter nally controlled fact ors are critically important. Additionally, DHA has adopted the HUD model program \"Rental Assistance Demonstration \" (RAD). This will have an impact on affordable housing in Durham allowing for the revitalization of some properties. CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 93 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Recommended Strategies Durham's affordable housing goals 2016 - 2021 include: Preserving and expanding affordable rental housing with a focus on households below 50% of Area Mean Income ( AMI ) Protecting low income residents in neighborhoods experiencing price appreciation Engaging the entire community to make affordable housing a priority Accountability for housing initiatives is important. This includes providing clear and easily accessible information on how to apply for affordable housing programs , the housing prioritization process , and outcomes ( e.g., number of applications, wait time, placement data, and prioritization category). Funding for inspectors to expedite HUD voucher requirements should be a priority. Employer sponsored housing assistance through land donations, down payment support, rental support, or actual building of housing u nits is being used by some hospital systems and insurance companies nationwide and is an opportunity that Durham may wish to explore. Homeless or hous ing insecure persons with ongoing medical needs are particularly vulnerable. Thus, identifying homeless and housing unstable individuals in the healthcare system should be a priority . There are specific diagnosis codes that healthcare providers can enter i n both inpatient and outpatient settings medical records, to indicate homelessness (Z59.0) and housing problems (Z59.9) . This could be used to trigger for appropriate referrals for assistance.

Indy of Health 96 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 4.03 Education Overview Good health and academic success form a symbiotic cycle: students who enjoy good physical, mental and emotional health tend to perform well in school, and success in school leads to a much greater chance of future health. Conversely, children who face abuse, illness, hunger or other forms of trauma often struggle in school, and a lack of academic success is a predictor of future health challenges.i From a community health standpoint, improving school performance is increasingly seen as a vital health intervention, while programs that address child and adolescent health and trauma are also critical supports for improved academic performance.ii Primary Data Four -Year High School Graduation Rate, 2009 -2017 The four-year cohort graduation rate in Durham County and North Carolina is displayed in Figure 4.03 (a). Although the graduation rate in Durham is below the overall rate in North Carolina, there has been an upward trend since 2009. The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) is a national school - based survey produced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is administered every other year. The 2015 YRBS was administered to randomly selected classrooms of middle and high school students in Durham Public Schools (DPS).iv This survey monitors health behaviors of adolescents. Key findings in the 2015 YRBS related to school success include the following: Sleep: The CDC recommends 9-10 hours of sleep each night for teenagers. Nearly half of middle school students and only 19% of high school students reported getting eight hours or more of sleep on school nights.iv Physical activity: It is recommended that youth 17 years of age and younger participate in at least 60 minutes of physical activity each day. Almost half of middle school students and about 37% of high school students reported being physically active 60 minutes or more at least five days per week.iv 68.386.5 68.881.494.694.6 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017Percent of Students who Graduated NC Durham NC 2020 Goal Figure 4.03(a): Four -Year High School Graduation Rate, 2009 -2017ii,iii CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 97 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Safety at school: 5% of middle school students reported feeling unsafe at school in the past 30 days. The percent of high school students who felt unsafe at school was 8%.iv Bullying: 65% of middle school and 54% of high school students reported seeing another student bullied at school.iv Mental health: 26% of middle school students and 28% of high school students reported feelings of depression. 18% of middle school students and 14% of high school students reported making a plan to attempt suicide.iv Several key policy changes and initiatives currently being undertaken by DPS could have implications for health related behaviors of adolescents. In 2015, DPS delayed the start time of high schools. DPS' Office of Equity Affairs has worked with Bull City Schools United to introduce anti-bullying efforts, such as the #Day1 pledge, at every school.v The school system is also in the middle of a three -year professional development project, Capturing Kids Hearts, focused on building positive relationships betwee n students and staff. The percentage of middle school students reporting having seen another student bullied at school decreased from 80% in 2013 to 65% in 2015.iv, vi The percentage of high school students who reported feeling unsafe at school also decrea sed since 2013 from 18% to 8%.iv,vi Mental health continues to be a significant concern for middle and high school students. Recent initiatives have included co-locating mental health services/clinics in DPS schools. Community members have continued to raise concerns regarding the lack of guidance counselors, social workers, and school nurses who would have the ability to positively impact school related health behaviors. Durham County has launched a major expansion of high-quality pre-kindergarten progra ms. Durham's Community Early Education/Task Force included representation from Durham's Partnership for Children, city and county government, local universities, the school system, and the community. The task force recommended that the county provide unive rsal access to high- quality pre-kindergarten.vii Research has shown that significantly more children enrolled in child care programs arrive at school proficient when compared to children who stayed at home or with a family member or caregiver.viii Secon dary Data While the percentage of Durham's population that is under 18 is slightly below the state average, the number of students living in poverty, the percentage of children of color and the percentage of immigrant children is considerably higher than the N.C. average as shown in Table s 4.03( a) and 4.03(b) .ix, xi,xii All of these factors correlate with health challenges and with barriers to academic success. This correlation is rooted in the social realities of institutional racism and the physical and psychological traumas of long-term poverty.x CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 98 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Table 4.03(a).

DPS hosts 4,760 English Language Learners; 9,800 students speak a language other than (or in addition to) English, using 91 languages.xiii At least 450 refugees (many are not reported) come from 14 different countries.xiii Organizing an educational response to poverty and childhood health needs is constrained by the multiplicity of educational institutions in Durham. In 2016, students were distributed as follows: Durham Public School s: 34,168 students (53 schools) 5,947 students schools) xiv students (37 schools) xv Home schools: 1,983 students xvi There is currently no administrative relationship between the public school system and any of the alternative educational institutions. Each charter and private school is an independent entity. Any educational or health initiative seeking to reach all of Durham's children is faced with reaching out to fifty different schools along with the traditional school system. For example, DPS passed a comprehensive resolution in support of advancing health in the community that committed the system to a number of actions: CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 99 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment WHEREAS, the district uses the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Coordinated School Health approach to comprehensive school wellness which includes eight areas of school health: (1) safe environment; (2) physical education; (3) health education; (4) staff wellness; (5) health services; (6) mental and social health; (7) nutrition services; and (8) parent/family involvement.xvii The DPS School Wellness Policy has more than twenty subsections addressing a range of health and wellness topics .xvii To guide implementation, the Superintendent, Wellness Coordinator, or District designee are charged with establishing a School Health Advisory Council (SHAC) that follows the CDC Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child model to govern their work. SHAC members must include a parent or guardian, a student, a local health department representative, member(s) of the public, a district representative, a school nurse, a physical education teacher, and a representative from Whole School, Whole Community, and Whole Child areas.xviii This wellness initiative, however, reaches only 72% of Durham's children and youth.xiv-xvi Charter, private, and home schools all carry out efforts to promote health, but these efforts are not at present coordinated with other sectors of the community. Community groups and the school system developed a new code of conduct in an effort to reduce the suspension rate in DPS. Overall, a significant gap remains between Non-Hispanic Black or Africa n-American students, Hispanic and Latino students and Non-Hispanic White students with regard to the likelihood of suspension. However, rates of suspension in DPS are well below the state averages as shown in Table 4.03(c) .xix Table 4.03( c). Long and Short Term Suspension Rates by Race and Ethnicity among High School Students, Durham County and North Carolina, 2015 -2016 xix Student Population Durham County North Carolina Non-Hispanic Black or African -American 20.7% 31.7% Hispanic or Latino 4.8% 8.9% Non-Hispanic White 3.0% 7.2% DPS students have achieved incremental growth over the past several years - evidence of progress, but still leaving many students well below proficient in reading and math. A full analysis of student achievement is available in the annual data release from North Carolina; table 4.03( d) showing elementary school student proficiency can be viewed as representative.

Additional efforts to address educational inequality and systemic barriers impacting certain groups of students (e.g., LGBTQ, economically disadvantaged, students of color) should be further explored and strategies implemented, such as racial equity training for administration and school staff. Support grade level readin g According to The Campaign for Grade Level Reading, reading proficiency by third grade is the most important predictor of high school graduation and career success.xxiv Recommended strategies focus on improving school readiness, chronic absence, summer learning, and parent engagement. Additional emerging issues include supports for English language learners and students with learning disabilities, retention policies, and Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) learning.xxv CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 101 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Current Initiatives & Activities Book Harvest Book Harvest provides books to children who need them and engages families and communities to promote children's lifelong literacy and academic success.

CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 104 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 4.04 Access to health care, insurance and information Overview Access to health care in a community refers to the ability of residents to find a consistent medical provider f or their primary and specialty care needs and ability to receive that care without encountering significant barrie rs. Special populations who face unique barriers include those who are experiencing homelessness, mental illness or non -English speakers such as some immigrants and refugees. In 2010, President Barac k Obama sig ned the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law. The aim of the ACA was to decrease the uninsured population through the expansion of Medicaid, creation of the Insurance Marketplace and other provisions set in place. \"The ACA's major cov erage provisions went into effect in January 2014 and have led to significant coverage gains. As of the end of 2015, the number of uninsured nonelderly Americans stood at 28.5 million, a decrease of nearly 13 million since 2013.\"i Com munity Assets Durham has strengths that offset some of these barriers. There are many medical experts in all fields and a high num ber of physicians per resident. Lincoln Community Health Center (LCHC) , a Federally Qualified Health Center , offers primary car e at a slidin g scale per federal poverty guidelines. The Durham County Department of Public Health provides free or sliding scale clinical services. There are also several free health clinics in Durham County such as Healing with CAARE, Inc. and the Samaritan Health Center . Senior PharmAssist helps seniors with medication access, medication manageme nt, and tailored community referral. Project Access of Durham County (PADC) links eligible low -income, uninsured, Durham County residents who use Lincoln Community Health C enter access to specialty care. Future of the Affordable Care Actii The ACA required most people to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty by 2014 . The law has close d the coverage gap by allowing states to expand Medicaid to low -income residents and through the introduction of the Insurance Marketplaces ; however, North Carolina did not opt to expand Medicaid. The 2016 presidential election resulted in a political party change for the White House . As of now, it is unclear what this new legislation will look like, when it will be enacted and what changes it may bring to the face of healthcare. Healthy NC 2020 Objective The Healthy NC 2020 Objectives included a crosscutting goal to reduce the percentage of non - elderly uninsured individuals aged less than 65 years over a ten year span. Neither Durham County CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 105 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment nor North Carolina have reached the goal. During 2015, other geogr aphic areas ha d similar rates of uninsured elderly populations, at 13.7% in Durham County and 13.0 % in North Carolina as shown in Table 4.04(a) below .iv,v Table 4.04(a). Crosscutting Healthy NC 2020 Objective iii,iv,v Healthy NC 2020 Objective Current Durham Current NC 2020 Target Reduce the percentage of non -elderly uninsured individuals (aged less than 65 years).iii 13.7% (2015)iv 13.0%(2015)v 8.0% Primary Data Interpretations: Disparities Gaps, Emerging Issues The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and the North Carolina State Center for Health Statistics (NCSCHS) present measures reporting the lack of health insurance coverage. The share of the nonelderly population that lacked insurance coverage has decreased since the year of 2009. As early provisions of the ACA went into effect in 2010, and as the economy improved, the uninsured rate began to drop dramatically for the nation.i Durham County is experiencing slower decreases but at a steady pace as shown in Figure 4.04( a) below .xii Figure4.04 (a) Percentage of Uninsured among Population Aged 18 -64, 2009 -2016, Durham, North Carolina & the United States xii The results for the 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey regarding access to healthcare are listed as follows:xi Insurance Coverage The survey identified approximately 80% of Durham County residents were insured over the past 12 months. Those that were uninsured listed cost, employer, and immigration as their three primary 0510152025 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016Percent Durham County North Carolina United StatesCHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 106 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment reasons for lack of coverage. About 15% of Durham County reside nts reported that they or someone in their household had difficulty accessing health care in the past 12 months. Of those respondents, f ifty percent report ed insurance coverage as a barrier to obtaining necessary healthcare while 33.3% reported that the co st of the co -pay was a factor in preventing obtainment of necessary healthcare . Access to Providers Seventy -five percent of Durham County residents have one person they think of as a personal doctor or health care provider. In the past 12 months, 83% of Durham County residents did not have a problem getting the healthcare needed for themselves and/or someone in their household. Those who did have problems reported dent al, primary care, and eye care as the most difficult services to access. Ninety -one per cent of the Durham County population reported only going to the emergency room for emergencies . Community Issues Inadequate health insurance remains one of the top five concerns for members of the Hispanic and Latino community in Durham County . Healthcare facilities accepting Medicaid were ranked second in services needing the most improvement by members of Hispanic and Latino communities. Health services were also ranked as the number one service to improve the quality of life of adults ages 6 5 and older. Secondary Data Durham Cou nty is currently ranked number six in the state for access to clinical care. Durham remains a leader in the nation with access to healthcare despite the social and economic factors that adversely affect Durham County residents. In Table 4.04(b) you will find Durham County clinical care rat ios and statistics as it relates to U .S. top performers (such as Orange County, North Carolina; Broomfield County, Colorado; and Ozaukee County Wisconsin) and NC.vi Table 4.04(b).

Although the convenience of having so many providers is a strong asset, it does not always translate from availability to accessibility. The county has been particularly hampered by a lack of health insurance coverage (whether private or public, such as Me dicaid) for many of its residents. The Affordable Care Act has helped reduce the number of uninsured Durham County residents. As of 2015 there are approximately 35,000 (was approx imately 47,700 in 2012) uninsured individuals in Durham. About 14,000 (app rox. 19,000 in 2012) have incomes between 138 -400% of the federal poverty level (potentially eligible for health insurance subsidies and mandated to purchase health insurance or receive tax penalty), and about 17,000 (approx. 23,000 in 2 012) have income be low 138% of federal poverty level (would be potentially eligible for Medicaid if NC had expanded under ACA and not penalized if do not purchase health insurance).viii However, it is critical to note that these figures do not factor in legal status . Undocumented immigrants will remain uninsured. Recommended Strategies Continue to disseminate useful health coverage information and advocate for basic access to care and expansion of coverage options. Make sure low -cost or free transportation to medical services is available , improved coordination and collaboration can make the most of limited resources. Continue to encourage clinics providing care to the uninsured or underinsured on a sliding scale or free basi s. Improve access to Social Security disabil ity benefits for individuals with physical, mental or co -occurring medical conditions . Make sure low -cost or free transportation to medical services is available. Continue to develop Partnership for a Healthy Durham inclusive of local organizations . Develop Durham wide agency based online referral network to exchange referrals with agencies Durham wide, utilize existing resources such as Network of Care. Current Initiatives & Activities Access to Care Committee (subcommittee of The Partnership for a Healthy Durham) Develops community and agency -based strategies to make measurable improvements in access to care for the uninsured and underinsured residents in Durham. http:// www.healthydurham.org Dental Workgroup (subcommittee of The Partnership for a Healthy Durham) Develops community and agency -based strategies to make measurable improvements in access to dental care for the uninsured and underinsured residents in Durham and advocates for changes that w ill affect dental access for residents. http://www.healthydurham.org CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 108 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Project Access of Durham County links people without health insurance into a local network of clinics, laboratories, pharmacies, and hospitals that donate their efforts to those in need.

Accessed July 4 Determinants of Health 110 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 4.05 Employment Overview Employment and income are important social determinants of health because sustainable incomes contribute to longer life expectancies. Employment status and income inequality can impact health in multiple ways. First, employment is a primary source by which health insurance is obtained by individuals and their families. Second, the nature of one's employment status (hourly, part time, etc.) determines to an extent one's income and ability to afford health insurance or access to quality healthcare. Third, employment allows for individuals to create a level of present and future financial security to address core living and health needs. Fou rth, lack of employment, underemployment, unsustainable or loss of income or unhealthy working conditions may contribute to poor health conditions such as high blood pressure, obesity, and depression. i Durham is at the center of the Research Triangle area, geographically and in terms of employment. Research Triangle Park and Duke University provide a strong employment base for the community, offering employment opportunities for Durham residents as well as for residents of other count ies in the surrounding region. Secondary Data In July 2015, 243,067 persons were employed in Durham County .ii This represents about 54 percent of the Durham -Chapel Hill Metropolitan Statistical Area's employment and about three (3) percent of employment in North Carolina . The unemployment rate for Durham County was 5.6 percent in July 2015. This rate was slightly lower than the 5.7 percent rate for the state .iii Durham County's unemployment rate has consistently remained lower than the State of North Carolina's rate since 2000 (See Figure 4.05a).

Health care is an economic cornerstone to Durham, contributing to a significant employment base. Durham's nickname, \"City of Medicine,\" i s reflective of the presence of Duke University Hospital, the largest hospital in the state with 1,124 beds and approximately 1,400 medical doctors. Between 2001 and 2015, health care and social assistance was the fastest growing employment sector in the county, increasing from 14 percent of the total workforce in 2001 to over 17 percent in 2015. Duke University and Health System with nearly 35,000 employees, is the l argest non -governmental employer in the state of North Carolina. IBM, the second largest employer in Durham County, is the third largest non-government employer in the state. The health care industry's importance to Durham's economy may also be seen in the presence of many biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical industries, and research organizations. The pharmaceutical firm, GlaxoSmithKline with approximately 2,400 employees, maintains dual headquarters in Durham and Philadelphia, suggesting Durham's importance in the industry. The firm is complemented by the presence of the world's largest contract research company Quintiles, which employs approximately 3,000 employees. Thi s company specializes in conducting product research for drug companies. In addition, many smaller companies involved in medical research and technology are located in the Triangle area.

During the same period, manufacturing had a significant decrease as a percent of total workforce as well as an actual decline in the number of jobs. In 2001, Durham County had almost 40,000 manufacturing jobs. By 2015, the number of jobs of manufacturing jobs had declined to just under 25,000 (See Table 4.05b ).

Emerging Issues By the beginning of the 21st century the City of Durham, like many communities throughout the nation, had suffered decades of suburbanization at the expense of an increasingly declining downtown. Commercial and office vacancies were high and few residential options were available. U rban renewal of Durham's traditional downtown was deemed an economic priority. In response, the City undertook a multi -year revamp ing of downtown infrastructure . Downtown was rezoned as a \"design district.\" CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 113 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Design districts, instead of regulating and segregating land uses in the manner of traditional zoning, regulate urban form and design, allow ing a mix of uses including vertical mixture s. Additional flexibility was added in the form of parking standards quite different from the standards applicable t o suburban commercial and office uses. A downtown Durham tax district was adopted by elected officials in 2012 with the purpose of incentivizing revitalization of Durham's downtown. As a result of these and other renewal tools, decades of decay and abandonment were reversed. Vacancies, particularly for office space, are now minimal and downtown is enjoy ing a building boom. The revitalization of downtown has led to the creation of hundreds of new jobs and construction of over 1,200 high -density housin g units. However, creation of a vibrant economy in downtown has resulted in a significant increase in commercial rents charged and concerns about affordable housing options in and near downtown. In the future, there will likely be a growing need for indus trial and office space. These segments of the local economy are not dependent upon demand solely within Durham but provide employment opportunities and produce goods for consumption in a larger market. The supply of office and industrial land should be re -evaluated based upon these factors as well as the specific location factors including access of in dustries within the community. New employment centers may need to be provided but should be placed in areas that will not undermine downtown revitalization efforts. viii Approximately 17,200 acres of land in Durham County is zoned for industrial uses with approximately 5,300 acres or nearly 31 percent of the land zoned industrial currently utilized for industrial purposes. A study conducted by the Durham City -County Planning Department in 2013 determined that: (1) By 2035, Durham will need approximately 3,500 additional acres for industrial land uses; (2) Much of the land zoned for industri al purposes is not marketable for such uses; and (3) Durham has an adequate supply of vacant, marketable industrial land to meet demand through the year 2035. A relative dearth of vacant, very large parcels of land (over 100 acres) impedes Durham's ability to attract large -scale industrial /manufacturing employers . ix Currently, there are about six million jobs available in the United States . However, employers often complain that workers do not have the skills needed for the jobs available.x Durham's economy is weighted toward medicine, research and technology, government , and educational services. Many jobs in these sectors, including entry -level jobs, require levels of education and technical experience that a significant number of Durham workers may lack. Recommended Strategies Continue to monitor the availability of marketable industrial land; Adopt design district standards for station areas surrounding Durham's proposed light rail and commuter rail systems; Continue to incentivize downtown revitalization; Identify and adopt strategies for provision of affordable housing in the vicinity of downtown and Durham's urban core; CHAPTER 4 Determinants of Health 114 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Provide training and apprenticeship opportunities for Durham's workforce.

In addition to the direct effects of violence on health, community -level exposure to violence has been linked to chronic health problems that include asthma, heart disease , ulcers, diabetes and lung diseasei For this reason, crime and safety are important public health issues, and an overview of crime and safety information for Durham County from 2014 -2016 is presented in this section. After several years of declines in both violent and property crimes, total violent crimes in Durham increased during the period between 201 4 and 2016.ii,iii The largest increases occurred among homicides, aggravated assaults, and robberies.

Robberies also grew by almost one third (31.2%) between 2014 and 2016 . Figure 4.06(a) Aggravated Assaults, Durham County , 2007 -2016ixxxi In a comparison of 2015 crime rates between Durham and similar cities in North Carolina, Durham's violent crime rate of 847 crimes per 100,000 people is considerably higher than the rate in Greensboro (597) and Raleigh (429), and slightly higher than Winston Salem's (759) .xii However, Durham's 2015 property crime rate of 4, 116 crimes per 100,000 people substantially lower than Winston Salem's (5,502). Gang Activity and Crime According to the Gang Crime Report, which reviewed gang -involved crime between 2009 and 2016, th ere are close to 2,000 indexed gang members in Durham.xiii This report shows a strong correlation between gang membership and violent crime in Durham. In 2016, 76.7% of homicides involved a suspect or victim that was indexed by Durham Police Department as a validated gang member. Table 4.06 ( e) Percentage of Gang Involvement in Homicides, Durham County, 2009 -2016xiv Validated gang members were also involved as suspects or victims in 11.3% of robberies, 11.9% of aggravated assaults, and 2.8% of rapes during 2016. Firearms were used in 74.8% of gang - involved Part 1 violent crimes.12 Juvenile Involvement in Crime During the period between 201 3 and 2016, juvenile offenses in Durham dropped significantly.

During 2015, 24% of middle school and 16% of high students reported carrying a weapon during the past month (defined as gun, knife or club). The percentage of hi gh school students reporting that they had carried a weapon decreased by 33% between 2013 and 2015. Approximately 4% of high school students surveyed had carried a weapon at school during the past 30 days . This represents a 75% reduction in the percent of high school students who reported that they had carried a weapon at school in 2013 , down from 16% . During 2015, 30% of middle school students and 49% of high school students surveyed reported the presence of gang activity in their school. This is a slight decrease in the percentage of middle school students reporting gang activity in school ( 32%) in 2013, and represents a n 11% reduction in the percent of high school students reporting gang activity at school compared to the 2013 YRBS survey. Current Initiatives & Activities Bull City United Implemented in November, 2016, this program uses the evidence -based Cure Violence strategy, a public health model that works to reduce shootings and killings in two specific Durham neighborhoods.

These factors help to reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and depression or anxiety.i,ii Physical activity has also been shown to increase children's cognitive performance and ability to focus as well as to help prevent dementia in adults.iii,iv The Healthy People 2020 goals ( https://www.healthypeople.gov/ ) are based on the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.v These guidelines recommend that children and adolescents, six to 17 years of age , should perform 60 minutes or more of physical activity each day including muscle strengthening exercises three days per week. The guidelines for adults provide recommendations for both aerobic and muscle- strengthening activities: 150 minutes of moderate - or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity aerobic activity per week and strengthening activities on two or more days per week. Primary Data 2016 Durham County Community Health Opinion Survey When asked about specific types of exercise, both the full county and the Hispanic and Latino neighborhood samples reported that structural changes such as better lighting, sidewalks, and crosswalks in addition to more trails, bike lanes, and groups/programs would make them want to walk or bike more. Responses can be seen in figures 5.01(a) and 5.01(b). Improv ements Needed to Increase Walking Ranked by County Residents, Durham, 2016 Figure 5.01(a): Improvements Needed to Increase Walking Ranked 5 Health Promotion 124 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Improvements Needed to Increase Walking Ranked by Hispanic and Latino Residents, Durham, 2016 Figure 5.01(b): Improvements Needed to Increase Walking Ranked by Hispanic and Latino Residents, Durham, 2016vii Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Disparities Results of the 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey highlight a large racial disparity in the percentage of people who meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation for physical activity in a given week. Twenty -seven percent of the Hispanic and Latino neighborho od sample met the recommendation for 150 minutes of moderate- intensity activity per week compared to 61.6% of the full county sample. Despite the substantial difference in physical activity reported between the two samples, the data should be interpreted w ith caution due to the potential for recall bias. Many respondents had difficulty estimating their average physical activity per week, which may have biased the results of the question. Any real differences between the two samples may stem from a lack of access to exercise facilities among the Hispanic and Latino community compared to the full county sample. Figures 5.01(c) and 5.01(d) below depicts that while about 42.6% of the full county sample exercises at a private gym or their neighborhood, only 9.2% of the Hispanic and Latino community reported exercising at a private gym and only 15.3% reported exercising in their neighborhood. The majority of the Hispanic and Latino sample (42.7%) reported their main place for exercise is at trailsCHAPTER 5 Health Promotion 125 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Physical Activity among County Residents, Durham, 2016 Figure 5.01(c): Physical Activity among County Residents, Durham, 2016viii Physical Activity among Hispanic and Latino Residents, Durham, 2016 Figure 5.01(d): Physical Activity among Hispanic and Latino Residents, Durham, 2016ix Disparities in physical activity exist in communities where groups of people are not given similar opportunities in social, economic and/or environmental contexts . There are neighborhoods that are not conducive t o physical activi ty and with 46. 1% and 41.5% of the full county sample population exercising at home or in the neighborhood respectively, individuals living in communities with poor lighting, sidewalks and/or crosswalks engage less in physical activity.x City and County residents' overall feeling of safety has decreased from 50% to 33% from 2015 to 2016. One-third of r esidents do not feel safe walking alone in their neighborhood during the day or at night. Satisfaction has also decreased in the condition of neighborhood streets (59% to 51%), the condition of parks (61% to 51%), and the condition of neighborhood sidewalks (44% to 42%) . According to the walkability result, Durham is a car -dependent city and has minimal bike infrastructure. However, there are a few neighbo rhoods with Public rec centerPrivate gym Work TrailCHAPTER 5 Health Promotion 126 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Duke University -East Campus Old West Durham (74/71), Walltown (72/69), Burch Avenue (64/71), and Lakewood Park (62/57).xi Gaps There are several opportunities for physical activity but the built environment in some neighborhoods has limited their accessibility to engage. This section will focus on gaps within the school system. Schools are ideal settings for children to get the recommended amount of physical activity. The Healthy Active Children 's policy was designed to ensure children in grades K -8 get 225 minutes of physical activ ity daily, and that teachers not withhold physical activity for any reason. Durham Public Schools (DPS) has a Wellness Policy, which includes physical activity guid elines and uses the Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child framework. Since 2015, DPS has been operating without a Wellness Coordinator to monitor, implement, and evaluate the policy. The absence of this coordinator and lack of funding have been detr imental to the policy's success and implementation and the physical activity opportunities for students. There are also limited opportunities for youth outside of school. The increase in teen activities was identified as one of the services needing the m ost improvement in the community (17.7% full sample; 31.2% Latino sample). xii Emerging Issues Research continues to support the link between physical activity and academic success in children as well as overall health in both children and adults. The concept of physically active classrooms is spreading. This concept incorporates physical activity breaks, classroom energizers, or other activities into academic lessons and ultimately improves a student's on -task behavior and academic achievement. Teach ers are also changing the structure/makeup of the classroom to accommodate students who need to move. Examples of equipment used in classroom include s FitDesk, hokki stools, and stability ball chairs, and stand up desks. Screen time continues to increase in school aged children. Middle and high school students are watching TV and using other computer devices more than three hours on an average school day. As new technologies are developed, there are applications that sup port tracking and engaging in physical activity. Recommended Strategies The results of the 2016 Community Health Assessment survey reveal several strategies for increasing physical activity among Durham residents. Implementing these strategies would increase access to participation in evidence based practices for getting the recommended amount of physical activity. CHAPTER 5 Health Promotion 127 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Target safety improvements to increase resident's confidence in being outdoors, including improved sidewalks, better ligh ting, crosswalks, and reduced crime. Develop physical activity for adolescents, particularly Hispanic/Latino youth . Improve the number and quality of parks and recreation programs, particularly for Hispanic/Latino residents . Offer walking programs to help residents meet th e moderate physical activity recommendation. Build trails connecting neighborhoods and parks to encourage walking. Although most residents do not ride a bike (76% full sample, 93% Hispanic/Latino sample), many in both samples would consider riding with bik e access, bike trails, safe intersections, and partner encouragement. Many residents (if they exercise) exercise at home (46%) or in their neighborhood (41.5%). Create opportunities for neighborhood -based physical activity, including neighborhood walking groups or home fitness \"teams.\" Current Initiatives & Activities City of Durham Transportation Department The Durham Transportation Department oversees planning and implementation for road, crosswalk, sidewalk and st reet light amenities in Durham. https://durhamnc.gov/1002/Transportation Parks and Recreation Durham Parks and Recreation Department oversees Durham 's many parks, trails and recreation facilities . https://durhamnc.gov/753/Parks -Recreation The Bicycle P edestrian Advisory Commission (BPAC) BPAC is an advisory board that advised the City Council and the Board of County Commissioners on matters related to walking and biking in Durham. https://durhamnc.gov/1383/Bicycle -Pedestrian - Advisory -Commission The Trails Commission ( DOST ) DOST is an advisory board that advises the City Council and the Board of County Commissioners on matters relating to the preservation of open space and trails. https://durhamnc.gov/1652/Durham -Open -Space -and-Trails -Commission - Bull City Fit Bull City Fit partners Duke Health and Durham Parks & Recreation to offer free, safe, inclusive wellness programming for children who have obesity. www.kohlsbullcityfit.org CHAPTER 5 Health Promotion 128 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment References i.

CHAPTER 5 Health Promotion 129 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 5.02 Nutri tion and access to healthy food Overview What and how much we eat affects our health in many ways. From emotional to physical health, success in work and school, the ability to sleep or to participate in sports: nutrition plays a major role. Many diseases are linked to nutrition including overweight or obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and some cancers . However , people do not make food choices base d solely on their physical needs. Food choices are made based upon taste preference, culture, environmental and social cues, and what foods are available. Durham County's nutrition environment \u2014the availability of foods and the culture surrounding eating \u2014strongly influences what its residents eat, and ultimately, their health. Primary Data The 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey included several questions about food and nutrition . Data related to food, nutrition, and food access obtained through the Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey are displayed in Table 5.02(a) below. Nutrition and Food Access in Durham County, 2016 Full County Sample Hispanic/Latino Neighborhood Sample Percent who cut the size of their meal or skipped a meal because there was not enough money for food 15.8% 26.8% If yes, percent who cut meals frequently 4.0% 4.0% Percent who selected more affordable healthy food options as a service needing improvement in Durham 11.5% 20.2% Percent who selected more affordable healthy food options as a service needing im provement for older adults living in Durham 25.5% 27.3% Percent who selected \"lack of health food choices or affordable healthy food\" as an issue greatly effecting quality of life in Durham 8.5% 6.8% Percent who identified obesity as a top health problem in Durham 47.5% 38.9% Percent who identified diabetes as a top health problem in Durham 37.5% 55.6% Table 5 .02(a): Nutrition and Food Access in Durham County, 2016i CHAPTER 5 Health Promotion 130 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Notably, the table above highlights the significant increase in stated need for older adults seeking out healthy and affordable food options compared to the population as a whole. Home cooked meals can also be an indicator for healthy meals. When respondents were asked how often they eat meals that are not prepared at home, 22 .0% percent (6.4% Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample ) stated they ate out more than three times a week, 38 .7% (30.7% Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample ) answered two to three times a week, 30.1% (50.4% Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample ) answered once a (12.6% Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample ) stated never.i Figure 5.02(a) below illustrates the response to the question, \"When you aren't eating a healthy diet, what do you think makes it hard for you to eat healthy? (Check all that apply.) Time and cost were the largest barriers that stopped people from eating healthier.i Barriers to Healthy Eating, Durham County, 201 6 Figure 5.02(a): Barriers to Healthy Eating, Durham County 201 6i Seco ndary Data Two surveys, the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS ) for middle school and high school students and Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS ) for adults over 18 years collect information about the eating habits of Durham County residents. The BRFSS currently collects data in regions that include multiple counties.

The largest disparities were seen in vegetable consumption by race, with 80.9% of non -Hispanic White respondents reportedly consuming one or more vegetables per day compare d to 64.4% of non -Hispanic African - American respondents. Mos t other fruit and vegetable consumption did not vary by geographic region, race, or educational attainment.ii It is notable that Durham specific data from 2011 showed that 19 .0% of adults surveyed consumed five or more fruits and vegetables daily , which is higher than the proportions reported for Region 5 during 2015 at 13.6 %.iii However, a ggregating county data into regions may have lowered the percent of respondents who reported eating fruits and vegetables. Data on fruit consumption and meal habits are available for youth in Durham County through the biannual YRBS survey. During 2015, the percent of students who reported eating breakfast once or more per w eek varied by race, with Hispanic and Latino students at the lower end of the spectrum (79.1%) compared to non - Hispanic African -American (84.3%) and White (93.7) students. Similar patterns were seen with the percent of students who reported eating one or m ore pieces of fruit per day. Non-Hispanic African -American students reported the lowest fruit consumption (26.4%) compared to Hispanic (38.0%) and non -Hispanic White (42.1%) students. In total, 14.7% of high school students reported not eating fruit at all .iv Percent of respondents who consume fruit one or more times per day North Carolina 56.7% Region 5 56.7% Race Non-Hispanic White 56.2% Non-Hispanic Black 55.0% Other NA Education High School or less 51.5% Some college or more 60.3% Percent of respondents who consume vegetables one or more times per day North Carolina 78.4% Region 5 77.1% Race Non-Hispanic White 80.9% Non-Hispanic Black 64.4% Other NA Education High School or less 69.5% Some college or more 82.5% Percent of respondents who consume fruits or vegetables or beans five or more times per day North Carolina 13.0% Region 5 13.6% Race Non-Hispanic White 13.4% Non-Hispanic Black 13.5% Other 15.6% Education High School or less 11.5% Some college or more 15.1% Table 5.02(b): Fruit and Vegetable Consumption, Region 5 North Carolina, 2015i CHAPTER 5 Health Promotion 132 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment The trends for vegetable consumption is similar to that of fruit consumption . Food insecurity, the state of being without reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food has a large impact on a person's diet. It is estimated that 17.9% of Durham residents (51,710 people) are food insecure.v Currently , there are 32,787 people living in Durham who receive Food and Nutrition Services (FNS, formerly known as food stamps or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP )).vi This number has decreased by about 25% in the last four years while the number of food insecure households has remained constant. In the 2016 -2017 school year, 66.2% of students enrolled in the Durham Public Schools (DPS) qualified for free and reduced lunch in school cafeterias, further supporting widespread vulner ability to hunger and food insecurity in the county .vii All DPS students have the option of receiving universal free breakfast. Limited access to grocery stores that sell healthy foods is also a barrier to eating healthier. A food desert is defined as a community in which people lack access to affordable and nutritious food and are of low socioeconomic status. Durham's Food Environment index is 6.5, falling below the state average of 6.8.viii Figure 5.02(b) above depicts Durham food deserts. As is seen nationally, the Durham food deserts coincide with census tracts that have high levels of poverty .x Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues The 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey results show that Durham County residents ' top health concerns are chronic illnesses that have proven links to diet and nutrition. Respondents with a greater frequency of fruit and vegetable consumption also report having completed at least some college w hich indicates a correlation exists between education level and food choice. Socioeconomic differences when combined with respondents perceived barriers to healthy eating (time, cost, and access) could conceivably contribute to a nutritional disparity in D urham residents. Food Desserts by Census Tract, Durham County, 2015 Figure 5.02(b): Food Desserts by Census Tract , Durham County, 2015ix - no grocery store within one mile no grocery store within \u00bd mile CHAPTER 5 Health Promotion 133 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Proposed cuts to Food and Nutrition Service ( FNS), school meals and other low -income programs could have a severe effect on food insecure households and overall nutrition in Durham County. The current state of and budget proposals relati ng to the nation's food assistance programs can be found at www.frac.org . Reinvestment Partners has received four years of funding through the United States Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Food Insecurity Nutrition Incentive grant program to provide nutrition incentive benefits to SNAP recipients. Partners on this project include Lincoln Community Health Center, Food Lion, and Duke's Division of Community Health . This program plans to incre ase the affordability of healthy food and serve as a model for preventive health care programming. Recommended Strategies The following key strategies are seen as best practices: (1) improving individual's knowledge of healthy food and beverage choices, (2) creating healthy schools, worksites, and childcare settings, (3) mobilizing the medical community, and (4) increasing access to healthy foods throughout communities. Even though Durham is recognized as an innovation hub and also considered the tastiest city in the South, creative collaboration s between the booming technology community and the restaurant and food truck culture are needed . This type of inventive collaboration could potentially be a resource to bring nutrition to the communities that need it most.

Economic Research Services Food Promotion 136 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 5.03 Tobacco Overview Tobacco use remains the number one cause of preventable death in the United States and in North Carolina . Although overall rates of tobacco use are decreasing , there are some groups who use tobacco at higher rates than the general population. These groups include Native Americans and American Indian s, the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning and/or queer) community , and people with mental health and/or substance abu se diagnosis.i Tobacco companies continue to target these and other populations in advertising and marketing campaigns.ii Additionally, some groups experience higher death rates from tobacco, such as African Am ericans. This disparity exists because menthol products have been heavily marketed to African Americans and are more addictive than n on-menthol products .iii Non-combustible tobacco products such as e-cigarettes have become widely available and use of these products is steadily rising .iv Although combustible cigarette use among youth is declining, e-cigarette use has sharply increased.v The Surgeon General's R eport released in 2016 focused on the effect of e -cigarettes on youth and young adults. The report made clear that e -cigarettes, like any nic otine -containing product, are detrimental to the developing adolescent brain. Steps must be taken to curb adolescent and young adult use in order to stop this emerging public health crisis.vi The long -term health effects of e -cigarettes are still somewhat u nknown. The 2016 Surgeon General's Report provided the impetus for Durham County to add e -cigarette s to the B oard of Health Smoking Rule, a county -wide policy which prohibits smoking and e - cigarette use in public outdoor spaces such as parks and bus stops . Following a directive from the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ), Durham is also working towards implementing smoke -free public housing . In addition , Durham is supporting market rate and affordable housing providers in going smoke -free. Creating more smoke -free places helps protect people from secondhand smoke and vapor, reduces triggers for people trying to quit, and decreases initiation among youth. Primary Data Adult Smok ing The 2016 B ehavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) data shows that adult smoking rates in Region 5, which comprises Alamance, Caswell, Chatham, Durham, Guilford, Orange, Person, Randolph, and Rockingham counties are at 18%, which is on par with the overall adult smoking rate in North Carolin a.vii In the 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment (CHA) Survey , 23.5% of Durham County residents reported that they had smoked a cigarette in the past 30 days. This percentage is higher than the adult smoking rate for N orth Carolina and Region 5 . It is important to consider that the 23.5% captures occasional smokers as well as daily CHAPTER 5 Health Promotion 137 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment smokers. The adult smoking rate for the Durham County CHA Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample was mu ch lower at 7.4%.viii The Durham County CHA survey data also shows that 8.4% of Durham County residents have used an e -cigarette or vapor product in the last 30 days.ix A question from the Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey asked respondents what they would do if they wanted to quit using tobacco products. The most frequently cited option was using nicotine replacement therapy (29.6%) followed by qui tting cold turkey (22.2%) and then seeing a doctor (13.0%).x A majority of Durham residents (5 5.1%) reported knowing about the Board of Health Smoking Rule which prohibits smoking in many outdoor public spaces. A question on the Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey asked where respondents had been exposed to secondhand smoke. The most frequently cited answer was bus stops for the full county sample (20.9%). Among the Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample , the most frequently cited answer was the workplace (15.5%).xi Youth Smoking The 2015 Durham County Y outh Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) reports that 9% of Durham County high school students currently smoke cigarettes . This rate is down from 19% in the 2013 Durham County YRBS .xii According to the 2015 North Carolina Youth Tobacco Survey, the rate of smoking among high school students in North Carolina is also 9%. The use of cigarettes among North Carolina high school students has steadily declined since 1999 . However , use of electronic cigarettes among North Carolina high s chool students has increased 888% between 2011 and 2015 , as shown in figure 5.03(a) .xiii High School Current Smoking and Electronic Cigarette Use, North Carolina, 2011 -2015 Figure 5.03(a) Current NC High School Smoking and Electronic Cigarette Use, 2011 -2015 1.77.716.8 15.5 13.5 9.3 024681012141618 2011 2013 2015Percent electronic cigarette smokingCHAPTER 5 Health Promotion 138 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment The 2015 North Carolina Youth Tobacco Survey reports that 16.8% of high school students currently use electronic cigarettes.xiv Durham County 2015 YRBS data reports that 24% of Durham County high school students currently use electronic cigarettes .xv Cigarette use and electronic cigarette use among high school students does not differ by race/ethnicity; however, males reported higher use of both.xvi Seco ndary Data Health y NC 2020 Objectives Healthy NC 2020 Objectivexvii Current Region 5 Current NC 2020 Target Decrease percentage of adults who are current smokers.xviii 18.4% (2016 ) 17.9% (2016 ) 13% Decrease percentage of high school students reporting current use of any tobacco productxix Data not available 27.5% (2015) 15% Decrease the percentage of people exposed to secondhand smoke in the workplace in the past seven daysxx 5.9% (2016 ) 7.7% (2016 ) 0% Table 5.03(b Current Progress Healthy 2020 Objectives for North Carolinaxvii-xix Table 5.03(b ) shows current progress on three tobacco -related Healthy NC 2020 Objectives.

Durham's death rate is lower than the statewide death rate but it is higher than two of its peer counties.xxiii Death rates from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer have steadily decreased since 2011 in Durham County and statewide.xxiv Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues When talking about youth initiation to smoking and disparities in tobacco use, the use of menthol flavoring cannot be overlooked. Tobacco companies have specifically marketed menthol products to young people and African Americans for decades.xxv Menthol flavored cigarettes are the starter product for many lifelong smok ers. Close to 88% of African American smokers use mentholated products.xxvi This is not by coincidence. Menthol cigarettes were marketed as a healthy alternative to regular cigarettes, and that misbelief has continued years after research has proven that clai m to be false. Currently, menthol product advertising is still more prevalent near schools and in African American communities.xxvii African American men who smoke are 50% more likely to get lung cancer than white men. Tobacco -related deaths continue to kill more African Americans than AIDS, violence, drug/alcohol, and accidents combined.xxviii Recommended Strategies Program and Policy Recommendation s for Tobacco Control Recommendationxxix North Carolina Initiatives Durham County Initiatives 100% smoke -free policies Smoke -free Restaurants and Bars Law, implemented 2010 Board of Health Smoking Rule, implemented 2012 Dining Al Fresco campaign Access to cessation support NC Quitline telephone counseling, text support, and website Fresh Start smoking Cessation Class Stay Quit Support Group High -impact media campaigns TIPS from Former Smokers national TV ad campaign to promote quitting Bull City Breathes campaign with Durham -based videos and print/digital ads to promote smoke - free laws and quit resources Table 5.03(c): Program and Policy Recommendations for Tobacco Control Current Initiatives & Activities QUITLINE NC QuitlineNC provides North Carolinians with free, on -one-one support that can make all the difference when you're ready to quit for good.

According to the American Cancer Society, in 2016 more than 15.5 million Americans were living with a history of cancer (excluding non-invasive cancer, as well as basal cell and squamous cell skin cancer) , with 428,800 residing in North Carolina .i It is estimated that about 1,688,780 new cancer cases will be identified in 2017 , of which 56,900 are expected to occur in North Carolina.ii Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and division of abnormal cells located within the body. Cancer is made up of over 100 different diseases and is often referenced based on the disease sit e such as the breast, colon or prostate. When cancer spreads from the initial cancer site to other parts of the body including the lymph nodes, it is said to have metastasized. The extent of the metastasis or spreading of cancer has a significant impact on survival outcomes. With appropriate screenings, early detection of some cancers can save lives. A cancer diagnosis can happen to anyone regardless of age, race or gender. The risk of certain cancers can be influenced by any of these characteristics and particularly as they interplay with genetics, health behaviors and other social and environmental factors. Over eleven million of the 15.5 million p eople living with cancer in 2016 were ages 60 years or older.iii In 2017, a pproximately 87% of cancer diagnoses will be in people over the age of 50.iv Increased age is associated with heightened risk of a cancer diagnosis. However, other social determinants of health and demographic characteristics also play a significant role in determining cancer risk an d outcomes such as race, ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status, citizenship, housing, educational attainment, and health insurance status . Cancer incidence refers to the number of people who are diagnosed with cancer in a given year and is usually repo rted in rates per 100,000 of the population. Mortality rates refer to the number of people who die from cancer in a given year per 100,000 of the population. Although cancer incidence and mortality rates have been declining over the years according to the North Carolina Vital Statistics report, cancer still remains the leading cause of death besides heart disease in the United States and in North Carolina.v Unlike other counties across the country, cancer is the primary cause of death in Durham County. Com orbidity is the presence of one or more health issues that exist alongside a primary disease. Comorbidities in cancer patients can compromise overall health requiring significant monitoring of each health issue. When not managed well, a person with cancer and other comorbidities may have heighten complications which can lead to poor outcomes. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) defines \"cancer health disparities\" as adverse differences in cancer incidence (new cases), cancer prevalence (all existing cases) , cancer death (mortality), cancer survivorship and burden of cancer or related health conditions that exist among specific population groups. Population groups may be characterized by age, disability, education, ethnicity, gender, CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 146 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment geographic location, inc ome, race or sexual orientation.\" For example, African American men have a higher incidence and mortality rate of prostate cancer compared to their white counterparts.vi Although white women have a higher incidence of breast cancer, black women are more likely to die from the disease.vii People who are part of racial and ethnic minority groups, the uninsured or underinsured, rural populations, and the elderly are more likely to have poor outcomes for a myriad of reasons which span across individual, communi ty, societal and health system factors.viii North Carolina is home to three world renowned National Cancer Institute designated cancer centers. Two centers are in the greater Triangle; UNC Lineberger in Chapel Hill and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) in Durh am. These centers are among the nation's highest ranked cancer facilities and are leaders in cancer care and treatment. Residents of Durham County may benefit from receiving cancer services at these two outstanding centers. Healthy NC 2020 Objective The North Carolina Institute of Medicine is targeting colorectal cancer as one of its three objectives for chronic disease reduction in 2020. There are several factors that lead to this decision. First, colorectal cancer affects both men and women and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths, besides to lung cancer in the U.S. and N.C. Lung cancer and colorectal cancer are highly correlated with smoking and reducing the rate of smoking is currently a NC Healthy 2020 objective, making it advantageous to address colon cancer deaths. In addition, since colorectal cancer can be easily prevented if caught at an early stage through screening, it is ideal to be a focus area for the state of North Carolina.ix Table 6.01(a). Healthy NC 2020 Objectives Healthy NC 2020 Objective Current Durham Current NC 2020 Target 1. Reduce the colorectal cancer death rate per 100,000 populationx 12.4 (2016)xi 13.1(2016) 10.1% 2. Decrease the percentage of Adults who are current smokers per 100,000xii 23.5 (2016 )xiii 17.9 (2016) 13.0% Between 2012 and 2016 , the incidence rate for colon and rect al cancer in North Carolina was 36.1 per 100,000 persons per year . Non -Hispanic other races had the highest incidence rate of colon and rectal cancer at 53 .7 per 100,000.xiv When diagnosed at an early stage, the colon cancer five -year survival rate is 90%. Once the cancer has metastasized, the five -year relative survival rate goes down to 70%. If cancer has spread to distant organs, (such as the liver or lung) the survival rate is about 13%.xv Unfortunately, only about 40% of colorectal cancer cases are found at an early stage. Given these data, it is fitting to have the goal to reduce colon cancer deaths from 15.7 per 100,000 to 10.7 as one of the NC Healthy 2020 objectives. CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 147 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Primary Data Cancer screening is an important tool of the medical community to decrease morbidity and mortality. Screening is a proven aid in identifying cancers and helping guide treatment decisions. Because cancer screening rates are measured and reported, they are a good indicator to monitor and compare cancer treatment and prevention strategies. According to the 2016 Durham County Community Health Opinion Survey results, cancer ranked fourth along with depression as an important health problem in Durham County. Wh en resident s were asked to cite their top five health problems that impacted the overall health of Durham County, 34.2% of respondents chose cancer as one of their top five.xvi This is consistent with priorities identified through listening sessions held in partnership with Duke and the community. Interestingly, despite cancer being the second leading cause of death in Durham County, it ranks as 4th in community identified priority .xvii 1. Obesity/overweight (47.5 %) 2. Mental Health (43.8%) 3. Diabetes (37.5%) 4. Cancer (34.2%) 5. High Blood Pressure (31.8 %) Seco ndary Data Where heart disease is the leading cause of death in most counties and states across the country, cancer was the primary cause of death in North Carolina in 2016 .xviii Consistent with national trends, NC, and Durham County both have the highest incidences of breast and prostate cancer, yet lung cancer has a significantly higher mortality rate than all other cancers.xix As illustrated in Figure 6.01(a), Durh am has a slight ly higher breast cancer incidence rate compared to the state. Colon/rectal and prostate cancer incidence rates in Durham County are also comparable to state rates.

Durham County has an age-adjusted cancer rate of 160.9 per 100,000 people from 2012 -2016 , which is higher than th e rate of heart disease at 130.0 per 100,000 people.xxii Figure 6.01(c) shows the proportion of cancer deaths attributable to the top four cancer sites in Durham County during 2012 -2016. Trachea, bronchus and lung cancer are the most common causes of cancer deaths followed by breast, prosta te, and colon rectum.xxiii Percentage of T otal Cancer Mortality by Site, Durham County, 2012 -2016 Figure 6.01(c) Percentage of Total Cancer Mortality by Site, Durham County, 2012 -2016xxiv Table 6.01(b ) Cancer Incidence R ates in North Carolina for Top Sites by Race and Ethnicity, North Carolina, 2012 -2016xxv Site Non-Hispanic African Americans Non-Hispanic American Indians Non-Hispanic Other Races Non-Hispanic Whites Hispanics Female breast 160.5 93.0 194.0 159.7 100.0 Cervical 8.2 4.7 9.3 35.2 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Qualitative and quantitative data show that despite some decline in cancer incidence and mortality, there are key opportunities to promote prevention and early detection of most cancers. For example, smoking is a key risk factor for several cancers including lung cancer and colon cancer. As illustrated, cancer disparities exist across age, race, ethnicity and gender. The role geography plays when living in rural communities with heightened challenges such as limited access to resources, information and services has yet to be fully appreciated. The impact physical ability, sexual minorities and other disenfranch ised groups face in Durham County as they seek cancer services is not known. With the growing number of cancer survivors in the county and across the state, the focus to develop programs to address diverse needs is becoming imminent. Cancer disparities exist as a result of societal factors that shape individuals ' opportunities and lived experience and are often framed within the context of the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH). The Social Determinants of Health are conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age and include the health system.xxvi An individual's environment is shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at national, local and global levels, which are influenced by policy choices.xxvii SDOH are key factors responsible for health inequities; these avoidable factors can be addressed by evidence based interventions focused on reducing the burden of these factors and improving overall health. Recommended Strategies Effective strategies designed to address cancer needs within the community and the healthcare system must incorporate a comprehensive, coordinated effort that is seamless across the cancer continuum. The strategies must appropriately address cancer disparities including the ps ychosocial -cultural, system and economic factors that can lead to poor outcomes. The following is a general overview of factors to consider when developing programs to address cancer risk and continuum of care. Risk of Cancer and Targeted Preventive Effor ts When integrated with chronic diseases and other related issues, education and prevention efforts provide a framework for implementing evidence -based early detection guidelines. Many cancers are preventable with lifestyle modifications (i.e. smoking, di et, exercise), making cancer prime for public health interventions. Key prevention -intervention opportunities include smoking cessation, nutrition, physical activity and vaccinations for infectious agents such as the Human Papillomavirus Virus (HPV). Cance r risks can also be attributed to genetics/hereditary factors and environmental effects such as radiation, chemical contaminants, pollution and infection.xxviii Knowing one's family history plays a key role in understanding cancer risk, likewise d eveloping or increasing environmental regulations and laws (such as no -smoking policies), to continually limit the amount of pollution can be helpful. Making genetic counseling and testing more readily available can serve as vehicle to ascertain one's risk proactively. Vaccines, isolation and other infection control measures and disease monitoring can all contribute to lowered cancer incidence. CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 150 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Critical to prevention and early detection strategies is ensuring that screening programs and activities reach un derserved communities and have a clear follow -up plan for patients who have an abnormal result requiring further Screening and Early Detection Screening can detect the disease at an early stage when it has a higher potential for cure. Interventions should explain the benefits and risks of general screening tests and connect candidates to appropriate screenings , and follow -up as needed . Survivorship As the number of cancer survivors continues to increase, understanding and addressing the long-term effects of cancer including the physical and psychosocial are critical elements of effective strategies designed to focus on this growing need. The increase of cancer survivors is due to many factors such as a growing aging population, early detection, im proved diagnostic methods, more effective treatment and improved clinical follow -up after treatment. Survivorship is the management of late and continuing effects of cancer and cancer treatment by means of identifying and accessing resources, family/caregiver support, pain and or symptom management and continuing treatment if needed.xxix Treatment, Palliative and End -of-Life-Care Palliative and end -of-life-care meet the needs of patients requiring relief from symptoms and psychological and suppo rtive care. End -of-life-care is particularly for those with advance stages who have a very low chance of being cured or who are facing the terminal phase of the disease. Support services are needed to aid with the management of the emotional, spiritual, so cial and economic challenges for patients and their family members. Creating opportunities to discuss palliative care, end - of-life care /decisions , and hospice are needed within the context of cancer and more broadly as proactive conversations with in famili es and with providers.xxx Current Initiatives & Activities American Cancer Society http://www.cancer.org Duke Cancer Institute http://www.cancer.duke.edu/ Durham County Department of Public Health Breast and Cervical Cancer Control Program (BCCCP) http://dcopublichealth.org/services/wom en-services/breast -and-cervical -cancer -prevention Support Group Programs http://durham.nc.networkofcare.org/mh/services/advanced -search.aspx?k=cancer Duke Community and Patient Navigation, Office of Health Equity and Disparities http://www. dukecancerinstitute.org/office -health -equity -and-disparities CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 151 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center NC Cancer Hospital http://unclineberger.org/ CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 152 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment References i American Cancer Society.

This causes sugar to accu mulate in the bloodstream instead of aiding in the body's energy metabolism .v Between 90 -95% of all diagnosed cases of diabet es in adults are t ype 2 diabetes .vi Gestational diabetes occurs in pregnant women when the woman's pancreas cannot produce enough in sulin to overcome the insulin resistance of hormones generated by the placenta; this results in an excess of glucose in the blood . vii Prediabetes can be considered a precursor or warning sign to t ype 2 diabetes. The condition occurs when people have blood g lucose levels that are above the no rmal range (normal is between 4% and 5.6%) , but the levels are not high enough for a person to be diagnosed with diabetes . viii Most peopl e with type 2 diabetes had prediabetes first.ix However, people diagnosed with prediabetes may be able to avoid or delay developing diabetes by taking steps to lower their blood glucose levels .x Diabetes is a major health concern in North Carolina and affects all socioeconomic groups. If not managed correctly, diabetes can lead to several other health complications including, but not limited to nervous system impairments, heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, blindness, dental disease, and kidney disease. xi Primary Data According to the residents who participated in the 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment survey , diabetes rated as the third -most important health problem affecting Durham County .xii Overweight and obesity, a risk factor for type 2 diabetes , was ranked first a mong those surveyed . Residents surveyed in the Hispanic and Latino neighborhood sample ranked diabetes as the top- most important health concern, followed by cancer and overweight/obesity , respectively .xiii Hispanic and Latino residents are more likely to be diagno sed with diabetes and experience poorer outcomes living with the disease .xiv In 2015, 14.1% of Durham County residents aged 18 years or older who received some level of care from Duke Health and/or Lincoln Community Health Center had diabetes .xv In 2014, 89 % of diabetic Medicare enrollees aged 65 -75 in N orth Carolina , and 91% in Durham receive d diabetes monitoring through HbA1c testing. (The hemoglobin A1c ((HbA1c)) test measures the amount of glucose attached to hemoglobin cells over the past two to three m onths; this measurement helps CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 156 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment people with diabetes and providers know if and how current treatment(s) are working.xvi) Eighty - four percent of diabetic Medicare enrollees aged 65 to 75 years in Cumberland County receive diabetes monitoring, 88% in Forsyth County, and 89% in Guilford County , making Durham's rate favorable in comparison .xvii Table 6.02(a). Healthy NC 2020 Objective xviii, xix Healthy NC 2020 Objective Current Durham Current North Carolina 2020 Target Decrease percentage of adults with d iabetes 14.1% (2016)xviii 10.7% (201 6)xix 8.6% is extremely expensive to the economy: it is estimated to cost the U .S. more than $105 billion every year . xxiiixx The disease cost the U .S. $5 billion in absenteeism, $20.8 billion in reduced productivity, and $21.6 billion as a result of diabetes -related disability in 2012.xxi People with diabetes have medical costs approximately 2.3 times higher than people without diabetes .xxii Across the natio n, one in five health care dollars is spent to care for people who have been diagnosed with diabetes; over half of this amount is used to treat diabetes -related issues . Diabetes is on track to cost North Carolina's public and private sectors more than $17 billion per year by 2025.xxiv Diabetes is also a leading cause of mortality, as the seventh -highest cause of deaths in both North Carolina and the United States . xxviixxv,xxvi Durham County has a diabetes mortality rate lower than most of its peer counties in North C arolina. During 2015, Forsyth County had a mortality rate of 25.2 per 100,000 followed by Guilford and Cumberland Count y, which both had mortality rate s of 24.7 per 100,000. In comparison, the diabetes mortality rate in Durham County for all residents was 19.9 per 100,000. Mecklenburg and Wake counties had lower diabetes mortality rates than Durham County . Many other health conditions are risk factors for diabetes. Overweight and obesity are strong contributors to type 2 diabetes . xxviii However, not everyone with type 2 diabetes is overweight or obese and people can have type 2 diabetes without being overweight or obese .xxix As of 2016, 65% of adults in the Piedmont region, which includes Durham, were overweight or obese.xxx Additionally, 12% of Durham high schoolers were obese as of 2014, which is a concern for the future rates of diabetes in Durham .xxxi Tobacco use also affects diabetes negatively. Smokers are 30 -40% more likely to develop type 2 diabetes and they also have more complications such as heart disease, reduced circulation in their feet and legs (often leading to amputation), and retinopathy . xxxii xxxiii In 2016, 23.5% of Durham residents reported smoking a cigarette in the past thirty days, makin g smoking a serious issue when dealing with diabetes in Durham . CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 157 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Diabetes is a contributing factor to many other health concerns. It is a leading cause of lower -limb amputation not related to trauma, new cases of blindness, and kidney failure in the United States .xxxiv xxxvi It is also a major contributor to cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of death in this country. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for people with diabetes: about 68% of people 65 and older with diabetes die from cardio vascular disease.xxxv Diabetes is also a leading contributor to end stage renal d isease ; the main reported causes of new cases of this are diabetes and high blood pressure . Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Diabetes affects minorities and low -income populations disproportionately. Race is a factor : as of 2015, 10. 9% of white Durham residents had diabetes compared to 20.2 % of black residents . xxxvii Income is also a source of disparities: p eople with lower income are more likely to report that they have been diagnosed with diabetes. In 201 6, 16.1 % of survey respondents in the Piedmont region with hou sehold incomes less than $15,000 reported having diabetes, compared to 6.1% of respondents with household incomes of more than $ 75,000.xxxviii xxxix Rates also differ based on education: p eople with less education have higher rates of diabetes. In 201 6, respondents in the Piedmont region with a high school education or less had a diabetes rate of 14.5 %, compared to 6.1% of respondents who were college graduates . Insurance status almost certainly affects how people are able to manage their diabetes. Ten percent of Durham County residents report that they pay for their own insurance or are uninsured .xl The self-insured or uninsured are less likely to receive regular diabetes care. Special consideration should be given to how to assist uninsured and underinsured populations. Figure 6.02(a): Diabe tes Prevalence in Durham Count y, 2015xli 10.9%20.2% 8.3%11.4% 0%5%10%15%20%25% White Black Asian or Pacific Islander HispanicCHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 158 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment There are also clear gaps in self -care practices and healthy behaviors, which are essential components of a diabetes management plan. In 2010, nearly 40% of Durham County residents with diabetes reported never attending a class or course on diabetes self -management and only 50% of respondents reported checking their feet at least once a day, which is the recommended frequency to prevent complications . xliiixlii In 2016, 7.6% of survey respondents in the Piedmont region responded that there were times during the past year that they did not have access to testing supplies such as strips and lancets due to lack of money . This highlights the difficult y many patients have with many aspects of diabetes management - many parts of which are often outside their control. Recommended Strategies Increase access to Diabetes Self -Management Education/Diabetes Self -Management Programs (DSME/DSMP) : Evidence -based diabetes self -management programs such as DSME/DSMP help people manage their diabetes, reducing complications and lower medical costs. One way of increasing participation in DSME/DSMP programs is to set up referral systems between health care providers and community DSME providers. Physicians would be able to directly refer patients to community classes, likely increasing participation. Supporting new or alternative methods of providing classes such as online classes m ay also make classes accessible to more people.xliv Utilize the services of community health workers (CHW): CHWs can work with diabetes care providers to help identify and overcome cultural barriers to diabetes -self management, make referrals to providers, coordinate patient care, and provide health information in a culturally sensitive and specific manner. Training CHWs to deliver information can have a great imp act on self -management behaviors in people affected by diabetes in their communities. Increasing funding for these workers and expanding their reach would be a great help in addressing diabetes in Durham .xlv Combined diet and physical activity programs : Thes e programs would entail trained providers in clinical or community settings who work directly with program participants for at least three months using a combination of counseling, coaching, and extended support. Multiple sessions related to diet and physi cal activity would be necessary .xlvi Case management and disease management : These are strongly recommended and have been shown to have a strong effect on improving glycemic control. Providing more funding and support for case managers and case management ser vices could help people with diabetes better manage their disease.xlvii Increase diagnoses and awareness in people with prediabetes .xlviii Offering free public and on-site screening events and allowing employees time off for testing could help identify people who have prediabetes and diabetes earlier. Earlier diagnoses leads to improved outcomes . Early detection is crucial. O ffering such screenings at places of employment and allowing employees to use work time could help with diagnosis rates .xlix CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 159 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Current Initiatives & Activities Duke Medicine's A dult Diabetes Education Group Classes Duke Health offers group diabetes classes led by certified diabetes educators.

Heart disease and stroke (a type of cerebrovascular disease) were the second and third leading causes of death in Durham County in 2015 .i An estimated 19% of 2015 Durham deaths were caused by some form of heart disease, and 6% of deaths were the result of stroke or another form of cerebrovascular disease. Together, h eart disease and stroke are among the most widespread and costly h ealth problems facing Durham County today . Over 35% of the adult population in Durham County ha s some form of CVD.ii Heart disease , which causes heart attack and st roke, is among the most preventable chronic diseases. Risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cigarette smoking, diabetes, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and obesity cause change s in the heart , arteries , and vessels that can lead to heart attacks, heart failure, and stroke . Risk of developing and dying from heart disease and stroke is reduced by improvements to diet, physical activity, control of blood pressure and cholesterol, smoking cessation, and appropriate aspirin use.iii Objective 1 of Healthy NC 2020 Chronic Disease i s to reduce the cardiova scular disease mortality rate ( per 100,000) . Chronic Disease Healthy NC 2020 Objectiveiv Healthy NC 2020 Objectivev Durham County North Carolina 2020 Target Reduce the cardiovascular disease mortality rate (per 100,000 population) 180.8 (2015) 251.2 (2015) 161.5 Primary Data According to the 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey, about 20% of Durham County residents believe that heart disease is an important health problem facing the County. The following health problems however were ranked as more important: obesity/overweight, mental health, diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure, aging problems, and asthma (Hispanic and Latino neighborhood sample only) .vi Seco ndary Data Heart Disease As Figure 6.03(a) displays, h eart disease -related deaths have been declining across North Carolina and Durham County since 2001.vii Durham County also has lower rates of heart disease -related deaths than North Carolina overall. In the latest data available (2011 -2015), Durham County's CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 165 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment heart disease death rate was 1 30.8 per 1 00,000 residents compared to 163.7 per 1 00,000 residents for all of North Carolina.viii County -level estimates by race, gender, or age are not available. The Healthy NC 2020 objective was to reduce cardiovascular -related deaths to 161.5 per 1 00,000 residents by 2020.ix Age-Adjusted Heart Disease Death Rates Stroke Stroke -related deaths are also declining across North Carolina and Durham County , as shown in Figure 6.03(b) .x In the most recent data available (2011 -2015), Durham County's death by stroke rate is lower than North Carolina's (37 versus 43.1 per 1 00,000 residents, respectively).xi These rates may vary by demographic indicators, but county -level estimates by race, gender, or age are not available. Age-Adjusted Stroke Death Rates 227.6 186 163.7186.1 154 NC Durham6.03( a) Age -Adjusted Heart Disease Death Rates for North Carolina and Durham County, 2001 -2015 6.03( b) Age-Adjusted Stroke Death Rates for North Carolina and Durham County, 2001 -2015 CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 166 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Results from the 2016 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) indicate that men have higher rate s of cardiovascular disease (i.e., heart attack, heart disease, or stroke) (10.9%) than women ( 8.6%) across North Carolina .xii Non-Hispanic Black or African American men and women also report a history of cardiovascular disease at slightly higher rates (11.2%) than Non - Hispanic White men and women (10.4%) . However, disparities are most pronounced when examining race and gender: 11.2% of Non -Hispanic Black or African American women have a history of cardiovascular disease compared to 8.5% of Non-Hispanic White women. This section examines disparities in more detail. Socioeconomic Status Disparities The mortality associated with heart disease and stroke varies across Durham County with highest rates identified in zip codes 27706, 27710, and 27701 . The highest incidence of is in zip codes 27706, 27701 and 27704.ii Based on m arket segment research, these zip codes are composed of some of the lowest income older adults in the county. The Claritas Lifestyle Segmentation profiles elde rly in these zip codes as the following :xiii 1. Park Bench Seniors ( Downscale Older Adults ) a. Demographic Traits - Income: Low Income (Over 50% of this population has a n annual household Income of < $35K) , Age Ranges: Age 55+ Education Levels: High Schoo l 2. Family Thrifts ( Low Income Middle Age) a. Demographic Traits - Income: Low Income (Over 50% of this population has an annual household Income of < $35K), Age Ranges: Age <55, Employment Levels: Mix, Education Levels: High School 3. Lo-Tech Singles ( Downscale Mature) a. Demographic Traits - Income: Downscale (Over 50% of this population has an annual household Income of < $50K ), Age Ranges: Age 65+ , Employment Levels: Mostly Retired , Education Levels: High School Racial Disparities Racial m inorities of nonwhite descent, carry a disproportionately greater burden of heart disease and stroke than Whites .xiv Despite having a lower total heart disease death rate than the state of North Carolina , people of color in Durham County have a heart disease death rate nearly two - thirds higher than whites. The 63% higher rate of death is due to numerous factors such as language and cultural differences, immigration status, lack of medical research, lower rates of insurance and access to care , less education al attainment , and lower literacy levels.ii Gaps & Opportunities Durham Health Innovations Project conducted research and identified f our gaps and opportunities for improve d heart disease and stroke management in Durham County . They are listed as followed: CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 167 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Disprop ortionate access to care along socioeconomic and racial segments , resulting in differences in access between insured and under insured /uninsured persons in Durham County ; Fragmentation of health care delivery among health care providers (e.g. pharmacies, support services, safety net organizations) ; Lack of patient education about heart disease and availability of community resources provides significant challenges for managing heart disease ; and Continuity of care requires a method t hat ensure s patients are not lost in the health care system .ii Recommended Strategies The Center s for Disease Control and Prevention recommends evidence -based six-step approach in clinical, community and individualized strategies for reducing risk and mortality rates of heart disease and stroke.xv 1. Policy Change: Durham County p olicy and environmental change addresses fundamental social and environmental conditions that operate early in heart disease development; this approach will influence later phases of the disease process. Examples include improving accessibility, use, and quality of health care. 2. Health Promotion and Prevention: Individual behavioral change, county -wide , can reduce the effects of adverse social and environmenta l conditions. It can also reinforce the approaches that follow . Examples include fostering community awareness and support for heart disease and stroke prevention . 3. Community Zip Code Analysis: Detecting and controlling risk factors for high -risk populations within Durham County is a priority that can be addressed by understanding where high -risk populations reside. Examples include identifying food deserts. 4. Clinical Care: Emergency care and acute case management for those who experience heart attack or stroke is a necessity . This strategy continues to apply when survivors of previous acute heart disease and stroke events experience recurrent ones. 5. Cardiac Rehab : Rehabilitation should be applied following all acute cardiac events which evolves into long-term management that will continue throughout the person's life. 6. Palliative Care & Hospice: End-of-life c are continues to aid how our community lives with heart disease and stroke. Ensuring all are informed and properly educated about opportunit ies for a better quality of life after all medical treatments have been exhausted . Current Initiatives & Activities American Heart Association (AHA) - Triangle, Morrisville, NC The AHA is the nation's leader in CPR education training. This branch advocates to keep communities healthy - free of cardiovascular disease and stroke. They also offer an online patient portal with educational tools and resources. http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Affiliate/Morrisville/NorthCarolina/Home_UCM_MAA007_ AffiliatePage.jsp CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 168 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Community Health Coalition The Community Health Coalition is fortified by its linkage with the Durham Academy of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmacy (an association for African -American medical professionals) to provide both volunteer leadership and medical grounding.

CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 171 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 6.04 Obesity Overview Overweight and obesity are defined as excess adipose (fat) accumulation, such that weight is higher than what would be considered \"healthy\" for a given height .i,ii Although energy intake and expenditure are key drivers of body weight , keeping weight stable is a complex process, and may affect individuals differently . A combination of causes and factors contribute to weight gain and obesity including genet ics and disease, as well as behaviors related to diet and physical activity (more information on physical activity and nutrition can be found in Community Health Assessment sections 5.01 and 5.02). Weight is used to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI), which is a common measure used to determine weight status. BMI is an individual's weight in kilograms divided by thei r squared height in meters (k/m2). For children, this calculation is also age - and sex -specific, and BMI percentile determines weight status. The table below shows weight status categories and their corresponding values/percentiles for adults and children. Weight Status Adults BMI Value Children BMI Percentile Underweight Below 18.5 Less than 5th percentile Healthy Weight 18.5 to 24.9 5th to less than 85th percentile Overweight 25.0 to 29.9 85th to percentile Obesity 30.0 or above 95th percentile or above Overweight and obesity are serious concerns, and are associated with many physical and psychological comorbidities for both adults and children . People with overweight or obese may also have health issues that includ e asthma, hypertension, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, gastrointestinal problems, sleep disorders, depression, and anxiety .iii,iv Individuals with overw eight and obesity often report facing weight stigma an d weight -based discrimination.iv Obesity is also relate d to lower health -related Q uality of Life.v, vi Overweight and obesity in ch ildhood are linked to increased risk of ove rweight/obesity in adulthood .vii Primary Data Community Feedback Nearly half (47.5% ), of Durham County residents identified obesity/overweight as one of the most important health problems in the county, according to results of the 2016 Durham County CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 172 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Community Health Assessment Survey. Diabetes (selected by 37.5% of residents as one of the most important health problems in the county), cancer (34.2%), high blood pressure (31 .8%), and heart disease (20.0%), all of which are conditions related to obesity, also emerged as important .viii Seco ndary Data National Prevalence Recent reports on obesity in the United States state that prevalence of obesity is approximately 16.9% among children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 and 34.9% among adults age 20 and older . Approximately 31.8% of children and 68.5% of adults meet the criteria for either overweight or obesity .ix Local Prevalence Local obesity rates have remained consistent in recent years. According to recent survey data from adolescents, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents in grades 9 through 12 in North Carolina is 32.3%, while the national prevalence is 29.9%.x For obesity only, prevalence among this age group is 16.4% in N orth Carolina and 13.9% in the U .S.x For local adults, rates are more similar to t hose nationally, shown in the graph below.xi, xii *Piedmont is defined as one of 3 state regions (others being Eastern NC and Western NC), and includes Alamance, Alexander, Iredell, Lee, Lincoln, Moore, Oran ge, Person, Randolph, Richmond, Rockingham, Rowan, Stanly, Stokes, Union, Vance, Wake, Warren, and Yadkin counties. **Region 5 is defined as one of the North Carolina Association of Local Health Directors Regions, and includes Alamance, Caswell, Chatham, D National Statewide Piedmont* Region 5**Percentage of adults with overweight or obesityAdult Overweight and Obesity Rates, 2015 (BRFSS)CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 173 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Cost In addition to health risks, overweight and obesity result in substantial economic costs . Individuals with obesity experience significantly higher medical expenditures than those without obesity, regardless of whether they are publicly or privately insured.xiii-xv Nationally, the proportion of annual medical costs attributable to obesity was es timated at approximately $147 billion during 2008 , and obesity -related medical costs have increased to 9.1% of annual medical spending, up from 6.5% of annual medical spending in 1998 .xv In North Carolina specifically, recent reports estimate that 9.9% of N.C. medical expenditures are attributable to obesity .xvi Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Disparities Identifying overweight and obesity prevalence by race/ethnicity can help target where health disparities are occurring as well. While race or ethnicity does not \"cause\" overweight or obesity, it is likely that related factors such as access to healthcare, healthy nutrition, exercise, income, education, and racism affect decisions that contribute to the prevalence of cases of unheal thy weight. Overweight and obesity rates in North Carolina are greater for Hispanic/Latino groups of all races, with 41.7% considered overweight in comparison to an overall average of 35.8% for all races and ethnicities. The African American, Non -Hispanic group had the greate st percentage of adults with obesity , at 40.1% compared to an average of 30.1% among all races/ethnicities in North Carolina .xii Disparities data on overweight or obesity rates in children ages two to 18 from low -income families who participate in the WIC Program ( Women, Infants, and Children, a s pecial supplemental nutrition program for pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women, infants, and children up to age five with a family income less than 185% of the federal poverty guidelines ) and Child Health Clinics shows the highest rates of overweight or obesity among Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander (34.4%) and American Indian or Alaska Na tive (34.1%) groups in co mparison to the overall sample (29.2%). Among White , Black or African -American, and Asian children, those who were of Hispanic ethnicity had higher rates of obesity than those who were non -Hispanic. Caution should b e used in comparing this pediatric information to information about rates in adult groups, as the grouping classifications for race and ethnicity are different, and rates reported here for children are for aggrega ted overweight and obesity data.xvii Gaps and Emerging Issues The 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey highlights several important gaps. Although the full sample and the Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample highlighted obesity and diabetes as top health priorities, the most commonly reported community needs f ocus on employment, housing and safety. Physical activity and access to healthy food are lower priority issues behind these crucial necessities. Access to quality healthcare is a critical component in managing the obesity epidemic. Yet many Durham resident s report barriers to healthcare largely CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 174 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment centered on lack of insurance or underinsurance. One potential emerging issue is the need for a medical home to deliver effective, high -quality and non -judgmental obesity care. Those seeking care with a provider they do not know are less likely to discuss personal habits and set goals for change. Yet, only 75% of t he full county sample and only 4 8% of the Hispanic/Latino neighborhood sample reported having a doctor.viii Recommended Strategies North Carolina has developed evidence -based r esources and guides suggesting ways to address obesity and support children and adults achieving a healthy weight and healthy lifestyle .xviii Below are strategies for weight management that will help individuals lead a healthy l ifestyle : 1. Increase physical activity. Recommendations suggest adults do at least 150 minutes of moderate -intensity aerobic activity per week, and children do at least 60 minutes daily. In additi on to aerobic activities, activities that strength en muscle s and bones are also encouraged . 2. Eat more fruits and vegetables. Federal Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend 2 cups of fruit and 2.5 cups of vegetables each day, with encouragement to choose fruits and vegetables of a variety of colors. 3. Drink fewer s ugar-sweetened beverages like soda, sweet tea, energy drinks, and sports drinks, which will help reduce calorie intake. 4. Eat fewer foods that contain a high number of calories from fat and sugar, or decrease portion sizes 5. Watch less television and decrease other screen time More detail about these strategies can be found in the resources developed by Eat Smart Move More NCxviii and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .xix Current Initiatives & Activities Partnership for a Healthy Durham, Obesity and Chronic Illness Subcommittee This group meets monthly to discuss and act on ways to move the people of Durham towa rd a healthier weight. They collaborate on actions such as writing letters of support for issues like creating walking trails in Durham neighborhoods , advocating for healthier food options in DPS, and promoting breastfeeding -friendly workplaces. http://www.healthydurham.org Public Health (DCoDPH) DCoDPH (http://dcopublichealth.org ) offers multiple services addressing healthy weight within their Nutrition Division and Health Education Division . Some of these include: DINE for LIFE offers nutrition education to schools and parts of the community which have high proportions of Supplemental Nutrition Education Program (SNAP, formerly Food Stamps) participants . Clinical Nutrition Services offers one-on-one nutrition counseling on a variety of medical nutrition issues including weight management. Offers group Diabetes Self-Management Education classes which include instruction on healthy weight management.

CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 179 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 6.05 Mental health and substance use disorder Overview Mental health and substance use disorders are among the top conditio ns for disability and burden of disease and cost to families, employers, and publicly funded health systems in the United States .i Mental health and substance use disorders have indirect costs such as prevention, treatment, and recovery supports; but also indirect costs such as motor vehicle accide nts; premature death; comorbid unemployment; poverty; school difficulties; engagement with social service, juvenile justice, and criminal justice systems; homelessness; among other problems.ii As of 2014 , approximately five percent of North Carolinians 18 and over had serious mental illness.iii In 2014, 6.1% of North Carolinians 12 and over were dependent on or abused alcohol and 2.8% of North Carolinians in this same age group were dependent on or abused illicit drugs .iv Healthy NC 2020 Objectives Substance Use/Mental Health Healthy NC 2020 Objectivev Current Durham Current NC 2020 Target 1. Reduce the percentage of high school students who had alcohol on one or more of the past 30 days 25% (20 15)vi 29.2% (20 15) 26.4% 2. Reduce the suicide rate (per 100,000 population) 8.1 (2012-16)vii 13.4 (2015) 8.3 3. Reduce the rate of mental health -related visits to emergency departments (yearly admits per 10,000 population) 156.2 (2016)viii 584.2 (2016)ix 82.8 Secondary Data Individuals with Medicaid or without insurance and no ability to pay are served by the public mental health system, managed by Alliance Behavioral Healthcare Managed Care Organization (MCO) . Alliance Behavioral Healthcare is a regional public agency that is responsible for managing behavioral health and developmental disability services in the counties of Cumberland, Durham, Wake and Johnston. Alliance Behavioral Healthcare recruits and monitors direct service providers of care, develops an adequate network of needed services, manages capitated funding from Medicaid and grant funding from the counties and state for be havioral health prevention and treatment services and staffs a 24/7 call center for information and access to services. In fiscal year 2017, Alliance Behavioral Healthcare partnered with a network of over 2200 private providers.x During this same period, t he organization served 46,204 individuals on Medicaid and another CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 180 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment 18,143 individuals through state funding.xi Also d uring fiscal year 2017, Alliance Behavioral Healthcare spent $2,124,408 to address naloxone.xii Alliance Behavioral Health Care has worked to fill a gap in the Durham crisis continuum with a Behavioral Health Urgent Care program run by Carolina Outreach. The clinic served on average almost 100 people a month during its first six months. The clinic is designed to serve individuals with Medic aid or those uninsured wit hin Alliance's catchment area.xiii Durham County also has a private mental health providers. According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) County Health Rankings, Durham County had one mental health provider for every 2 00 Durham County residents in 2017. The ratio was 490:1 for North Carolina and 360:1 for top performing counties in the U.S.xiv Opioids North Carolina is experiencing an opioid epidemic similar to other communities across the country . Between 1999 and 2016 , more than 12,000 North Carolinians died from opioid -related overdoses.xv Deaths due to medication/drug overdoses have been steadily increasing since 1999, and the vast majority (~85%) of these are unintentional.xvi The number of medication/drug deat hs has increased 410%, from 363 in 1999 to 1,851 in 2016.xvii In Durham County, throughout 2016 , naloxone , a drug used to reverse opioid overdoses, was administered to 232 people in Durham County via Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ).xviii This data has been used as a proxy to estimate the number of opioid related overdoses resulting in an Emergency Department ( ED) visit in Durham County due data inaccuracies that made surveillance data predating 2017 inaccurate . The NC Injury and Violence Prevention branch has estimated the average medical costs and work loss costs from medication and drug fatalities based on 2010 prices, then indexed to 2015 prices in the state. These estimates do not include costs associated with treatment and recovery.xix ACE s ACEs are adverse childhood experiences that harm children's developing brains and lead to changing how they respond to stress . This damages their immune systems so profoundly that the effects show up decades later. ACEs cause much of adults' burden of chronic disease, most mental illness, and a re at the root of most violence.xx The 10 ACEs the researchers measured include: physical, sexual and verbal abuse ; physical and emotional neglect ; a family member who is depressed or diagno sed with other mental illness , addicted to alcohol or another substance , in prison ; witnessi ng a mother being abused and l osing a parent to sepa ration, divorce or other reason . CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 181 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Resilience Resilience is the process of adapting w hile in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or even significant sources of stress \u2014 such as family and relationship problems, serious health problems, or workplace and financial stressors.xxi It means \"bouncing back\" from difficult experiences. Re search has shown that resilience is ordinary, not extraordinary. The main focus of the Durham County ACEs initiative is not only to increase knowledge and awareness, but also to identify and increase people's resilience and capacity to address challenges and adverse events as an adult. The long -term vision is to incorporate ACEs screenings and resilience education and resources in all health care visits for men, women, and children county - wide. In January 2017, the Durham County Board of County Commission ers (BOCC) began a collaborative effort with Durham County Department of Public Health and other community organizations in the County to address ACEs in the Durham community. The ACEs workgroup and subcommittees are currently developing an implementation plan to address ACEs in Durham County, with a pilot focusi ng on women of reproductive age . Primary Data 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey The 201 6 Durham County Community Health Assessment respondents were asked to identif y the top three health problems in their community .xxii In the full c ounty sample, mental health was ranked second , with 43.8% of respondents indicating it being an issue in their communities . Substance abuse was ranked twelfth by 2% of respondents . In the Hisp anic/ Latino neighborhood sample, mental health was the fourth most cited health issue (31.7%) in the community and substance use was not listed.xxiii Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) The YRBS is a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) survey designed to monitor priority risk behaviors . It is administered every two years and uses a random sample of middle schools and high schools in the Durham Public Schools system . Findings from Durham's 2015 YRBS indicated that of the high school students surveyed :xxiv 27% reported depression in the past year (feeling so sad or hopeless almost every day for 2 weeks or more in a row that they stopped doing usual activities) 14% made a plan to attempt suicide 25% had one or more drinks of alcohol in the pas t 30 days These percentages were not statistically different from the statewide results. Findings for the 2015 YRBS showed that middle school students who answered the survey :xxv 26% reported depression in the past year (feeling so sad or hopeless almos t every day for 2 weeks or more in a row that they stopped doing usual activities) CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 182 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment 18% made a plan to attempt suicide The percentage of middle school students who made a plan to attempt suicide was 4% higher than the state average . Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging I ssues Access to mental health and substance use disorder services for individuals can vary widely depending on a number of factors such as insurance coverage, specific type of mental health or substance use disorder, and geographic location.xxvi Treatment of mental health and substance use disorders is difficult for many reasons. There is no single \"system\" for mental health and substance u se services. Services and providers are often fragmented with agencies p roviding funding and oversight.xxvii This fragmentation of the mental health and substance use service systems c ause disparities in access to high -quality, effective prevention, treatment, and recovery services, lack of integration between mental health and substance use services and physical health services, and the nearly constant changes over the past 15 years to Nor th Carolina's public mental health and substance use system.xxviii All of these factors create significant systemic barriers to delivering the prevention, treatment, and recovery services that are needed.xxix Those who experience disparities in mental he alth and substance use treatment include: xxx, xxx i Blacks Latinos American Indians/Alaska Natives Asian Americans Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) population People with disabilities Transition -age youth Young adults Recommended Strategies Selected recommendations to address issues with mental health and substance use treatment in North Carolina include:xxxii Provide case management and recovery navigation Require North Carolina agencies to share data cross -agency Assess and address disparities in the LME/MCO system Expand access to mental health and substance use services Educate communities on available mental health and substance use services Develop a common access point for the mental health and substance use p revention, treatment, and recovery system Increase the number of North Carolinians trained in Mental Health First Aid Educate school personnel on the behavioral health needs of adolescents CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 183 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Support the implementation of trauma -informed child and family serv ing systems across North Carolina counties Increase care management services for older adults Current Initiatives & Activities Alliance Behavioral Healthcare Manager of public behavioral health and developmental disability services. http://www.alliancebhc.org/ Carolina Outreach Behavioral Health Urgent Care Walk -in clinic for hose experiencing a mental health crisis or substance use problems.

CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 186 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 6.06 Asthma Overview Asthma is a common chronic disorder of the airways in lungs that causes difficulty in breathing . \"Asthma attacks\" or \"episodes\" are caused by severe narrowing of the airway s, restricting air coming in and out of the lungs. Asthma attacks can have varying severity. They may be mild, moderate or severe enough to become life- threatening. Common symptoms of an asthma attack include wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath and chest tightness or pain. In most cases, the cause(s) of asthma is unknown; however, multiple host and environmental factors may be involved in the development of asthma and asthma attacks. Exposures associated with asthma attacks include exercise, airway infections, airborne allergens (e.g., pollen, mold, animal dander, dust mites), occupational exposures and air pollution (e.g., environmental tobacco smoke, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds). Although there is no cure, asthma can be controlled with appropriate medical care, allergen avoidan ce and control and pharmacotherapy. Asthma attacks can also be prevented by identifying triggers and avoiding exposures that are known to cause attacks. i Healthy People 2020 Objectives There is no Healthy North Carolina 2020 objective for asthma. However, the U.S. Department of Health and Human services (DHHS), has established national objectives for asthma in the Healthy People 2020 Initiative. \"Healthy People\" is a set of goals and objectives, with 10 year targets, to guide national health promot ion and disease prevention efforts that can improve the health of all people in the United States. The objectives for asthma are as follows:ii Reduce asthma deaths Reduce hospitalizations Reduce emergency department (ED) visits Reduce activity limitations among persons with current asthma Reduce the proportion of person with asthma who miss school or works days Increase the proportion of persons with current asthma who receive formal patient education Increase the proportion of persons with current asthma w ho receive appropriate asthma care according to the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) guidelines North Carolina Leading Causes of Deathiii In 2015 chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRD) was one of the top causes of death for both Durham County and the state of North Carolina. CLRD includes both asthma and chronic CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 187 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , but deaths are mainly attributable to COPD . For adults, CLRD is the fifth cause of death in Durham County and the third leading cause of death in the state. At both the state and county level, CLRD is ranked higher in Whites than African Americans. For Durham County, CLRD is ranked ninth for African Americans and fifth for Whites . CLRD is ranke d seventh for African Americans and third for Whites in the state. Secondary Data Asthma rates are rising for all age groups in urban and rural areas regardless of race, income and region of the country. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of people diagnosed with asthma increased by 4.3 million from 2001 to 2009, with the most significant increase in black children. In 2011, 26 million people (1 in 12) had asthma; 8. 2% of all adults and 9.5% of all children. In 2010, there were approximately 14. 2 million visits to primary care providers, 1.8 million visits to emergency department and 439, 400 hospitalizations with asthma listed as the primary diagnosis in the U.S .i,iv The burden of asthma also extends to North Carolina. In 2015, approximately 13.4% of North Carolina adults have ever been told that they had asthma and 8.2% of North Carolina adults still have asthma, compared to 11.7% and 7.7% in 2012, respectively . Amo ng children, 17.9% of North Carolina children have reported ever being told that they have asthma and 10.5% of North Carolina children still had asthma , according to 2013- 2014 survey estimates . vi Although prevalence data for Durham County are unavailable , it was noted as being an important health problem in Durham County by residents who participated in the Community Health Assessment Opinion survey in 2016. Specifically, 7.3% of the full county survey participants noted asthma as being a significant prob lem as well as 24.1% of the Hispanic and Latino neighborhood survey respondents. Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Asthma disproportionately affects persons of low socioeconomic status and minority groups. Household income and educational attainment are directly related to disease severity, poor lung function and functional limitation.vii African Americans are three times more likely to die as a consequence of asthma compared to Non -Hispanic whites , with African -American childre n being admitted to the hospital at four times the rate of Non -Hispanic white children for asthma.ix Hispanic/Latino are admitted to the ED at two times the rate of Non-Hispanic whites for asthma related complications.x The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 Guidelines (NAEPP -EPR3) suggests that most patients with asthma can significantly control their disease and reduce their symptoms if they receive quality medical care, use inhaled corticosteroids when prescribed and modify their environment to reduce or eliminate exposure to allergens and irritants. CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 188 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment These guidelines have been shown to improve asthma control and decrease health care utilization in several high- risk populations, including inner -city populations, Afric an Americans and Hispanics. xiii, xiv, xv, xvi, xvii However, despite the presence of these guidelines and evidence that they are effective, disparities in asthma- related outcomes persist. Health disparities result from a complex interaction of several health determinants such as genetics, biology, individual behavior, health services, socioeconomic status, discrimination, literacy levels and legislative policies.xviii In order to eliminate disparities, one must identify factors that drive disparate out comes, understand how the health determinants interact with each other, increase the inclusion of historically underrepresented populations in clinical research and design interventions to target several health determinants simultaneously. Recommended Strategies The NAEPP EPR -3 Guidelines for Diagnosis and Management of Asthma provides the framework for quality asthma clinical care. It includes a step -wise approach that consists of assessments and monitoring, education for partnership in asthma care, control of environmental factors and comorbid conditions that affect asthma and the initiation of medications for asthma control.xix There are several care models that use the EPR -3 guidelines to improve asthma outcomes. The Chronic Care Model aids in tran sforming health care from a system that is reactive to one that is proactive in responding to the needs of patients. The Chronic Care Model has six elements that consist of the following:xx 1. Community: Mobilize community resources to meet the needs of pati ents 2. Health System: Creating culture, organization and mechanisms that promote safe and high quality care 3. Self-Management Support: Empower and prepare patients to manage their health and health care 4. Delivery System Design: Assure the delivery of effective, efficient clinical care and self - management support 5. Decision Support: Promote clinical care that is consistent with scientific evidence and patient preferences 6. Clinical Information Systems: Organize patient and population data to facilitate efficient care. The Chronic Care Model facilitates an ongoing quality improvement process which allows one to monitor patients with asthma and make adjustments to medications to prevent emergency department visits and hospitalizations. Through this model, the patient becomes informed and is active in the care management process. Providers are prepared and proactive with providing quality care with the patient's input. This leads to productive interactions, effective communications and improved outcomes. xxi The Guide to Community Preventive Services recommends a home- based multi -trigger, multicomponent intervention with an environmental focus for children and adolescents with asthma. Their recommendation is based on strong evidence of effectiveness in improving overall quality of life and productivity as exemplified by improved asthma symptoms and reduced number CHAPTER 6 Chronic Disease 189 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment of school days missed. The Guide to Community Preventive Services report supports expanding asthma education beyond the clinical setting to eliminate and/or reduce asthma environmental triggers in the home and to have improved patient outcomes through case management services. xxii Of note, the Guide to Community Preventive Services found insufficient evidence to support the use of home -based, multi -trigger, multi component interventions in adults secondary to the small number of studies with inconsistent results. Current Initiatives & Activities North Carolina Asthma Program The North Carolina Asthma Program developed the Asthma Education Curriculum for School Nurses and Other Elementary and Middle School Professionals as a resource to address asthma in the school setting. The Asthma Program offers a train - the - trainer session to train school nurses on how to use the curriculum in their schools and school sta ff to understand the needs of students with asthma.

CHAPTER 7 Reproductive Health 193 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Reproductive Health Reproductive health is an important topic to all persons in Durham County, regardless of age, gender, or position in life. Good reproductive health means all individuals are able to have a responsible, safe, and satisfying sex life and the capability to reproduce, along with the freedom to decide if, when, and how often to do so. A key part of good reproductive health is women and men's right to be informed of and have access to safe, effective, and affordable contraceptive methods of their choice. This also means the right to access appropriate health care services that will enable women (and their partners) to safely access reproductive services and/or go through pregnancy, prenatal care, birth, and the postpartum period i n order to provide the best chance of having a healthy infant. Maternal health encompasses the health of a woman before conception and during her pregnancy, birth, and postpartum period. Maternal health is an important predictor of newborn health and well-being. Focusing on the health of a woman before pregnancy is also essential to help poor birth outcomes such as low birth weight, pre -term birth, and infant death.i This strategy has been shown to improve the lives of women and their babies and families.ii Healthy birth outcomes and addressing health conditions among infants early can prevent death or disability and enable children to reach their full potential. Maternal health is also an important indicator of the health of a society, due to the important and complex role women play in families and communities. Addressing women's health effectively is essential in improving the health of new mothers and birth outcomes, which in turn affects their families and communities. Many factors affect maternal healt h including individual health knowledge and behaviors, access to appropriate care, and socioeconomic factors. This chapter includes: Pregnancy, Fertility and Abortion CHAPTER 7 Reproductive Health 194 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 7.01 Pregnancy, fertility, and abortion Overview For reproductive health, it is important for individuals to think about goals for having or not having children, and how to achieve those goals. This process is called reproductive life planning, and there are many kinds of reproductive life plans. Plans will depend on an individ ual's personal goals such as educational, job, or career goals, living situation, amount of social support, and personal health behaviors such as diet, exercise, and sleep habits.iii Reproductive life planning will help individuals recognize what steps are n eeded for having children or not having children, prevent unintended pregnancies, and ensure healthy outcomes for women, children, and families. The term unintended pregnancy refers to a pregnancy that was mistimed, unwanted, or unplanned at the time of conception. Nearly half of all pregnancies in North Carolina were unintended in 2015 .vi Unintended pregnancies can result in serious health, social, and economic consequences for women, families, and communities. Further, North Carolina data shows significant disparities in unintended pregnancies when looking at age, race, income, and education , which are highlighted below in the secondary data subsection.vi Primary Data 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey The 2016 Community Health Assessment Survey asked participants if they had problems getting the health care they needed, either personally or for someone in their household, from any type of health care provider. In the full county sample, 15.2% responded \"yes\". Of these respondents, 10.0% listed obstetrician/gynecologist (OB -GYN) as the type of provider. This was similar to the Hispanic and Latino sample, in which 17.7% indicated having trouble getting n eeded healthcare . Of those respondents, 9.1% had trouble accessing an OB-GYN and had trouble accessing 3.0% sexual health services .iv Survey respondents were also asked to rank their top three neighborhood concerns related to community issues, risky behavi ors and health problems. Fourteen percent of respondents believe that sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are among the most important health problems in Durham County .iv CHAPTER 7 Reproductive Health 195 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Secondary Data Healthy NC 2020 Objective Healthy NC 2020 Objectivev North Carolinavi 2020 Target Decrease the percentage of pr egnancies that are unintended. 27.9% (2015) 30.9% Table 7.01(a). Healthy NC 2020 Objectives: Sexually Transmitted Diseases/Unintended Pregnancyv,vi, Pregnancy, Fertility, and Abortion Figure 7.01(a) below gives an overview of North Carolina's and Durham County's 2015 pregnancy, fertility and abortion rates per 1,000 population, by age group. The Durham County pregnancy rate and fertility rate are both lower compared to North Carolina for ages 15 -29, and higher for ages 30 -44. During 2015, the abortion rate in Durham County (7.0 per 1,000) was similar to the rate in North Carolina (6.4 per 1,000) among women aged 15 -19.vii In contrast, the abortion rate for women aged 15 -19 in Durham County was almost twice as high compared to the average rate in North Carolina during 2012 (13.7 per 1,000 population compared to 7.0 per 1,000 population).viii However, abortion rates in Durham County remain higher among all ages when compared to North Carolina.viii Durham County North Carolina Pregnancy Rate Fertility Rate Abortion Rate Pregnancy Rate Fertility Rate Abortion Rate 15-19 29.9 22.5 7 30.2 23.5 6.4 20-24 88.2 62.5 25.1 105.4 84.4 20.4 25-29 95.8 77.3 123.5 104.8 18 113.3 99.8 107.8 95.8 11.4 35-44 42.5 36.8 5.6 31.1 26.4 4.4 Table 7.01(a): Pregnancy, Fertility and Abortion Rates per 1,000 Population by Age, North Carolina and Durham County, 2015vii Unintended Pregnancy There is no recent Durham County -specific data available for unintended pregnancies. In 201 5, the North Carolina Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) Survey asked women if their pregnancy was intended. Out of 891 respondents in North Carolina, 27.9% (n= 236) said their pregnancy was unintended, and 14.7% (n= 12 8) said they were not sure, meaning nearly half of these pregnancies were unintended.ix These percentages are significantly lower compared to survey results from 201 0, in which 45.2% of respondents indicated that their pregnancy was unintended.x The survey results also show disparities in unintended pregnancies by age and race. See Figures 7.01( b-c) for these results from the 201 5 NC PRAMS Survey. CHAPTER 7 Reproductive Health 196 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues As seen in Figures 7.01( b-c) below , significant disparities in unintended pregnancies exist across age groups and races and ethnicities in North Carolina . During 2015, m others less than 24 years of age were more than twice as likely to have an unintended pregnancy compared to women 25 years old and older. African -American women were also nearly twice as likely to have an unintended pregnancy compared to Whites, who have the least risk compared to all other races.xi Women with a high school education or less, Medicaid recipients, and responde nts who answered \"other\" to marital status were also at a much higher risk of unintended pregnancy.xii Adolescents and women of color, particularly those with less education and/or income, are at a higher risk for adverse health outcomes, reliance on social services, and poorer quality of life.

There are various ways to ensure women have access to birth control, including: Emergency contraception, when used up to five days after sex Outlawing pharmacies from refusing to fill women's prescription for birth control Government provision of affordable birth control for low -income women at family planning clinics Requirements for insurance companies that provide prescription drug coverage to also provide birth control Legislation requiring pharmacies to dispense birth control regardless of moral or religious beliefs Media campaigns for contraceptive options, particularly long -acting reversible contraception (or LARCs, such as intrauterine devices ( IUDs) and implants) Increased visibility of clinics that provide low -cost or no -cost family planning services Even with improved access to birth control methods, unintended pregnancy may continue to be a problem. Continued education on reproductive life pla nning and contraceptive options for women and their partners is a vital step. Women who intentionally choose to become pregnant are apt to be better prepared emotionally and financially for the demands of pregnancy and childbearing.xiii Resources such as the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC's ) \"Are You Ready Sex and Your Future\" guide can help initiate conversations about reproductive life planning and raise important questions that can lead to making better health decisions.xiv Current Initiatives & Activities Durham Department of Public Health The Maternal Health clinic offers several low -cost to no -cost contraceptive services and supplies for women of childbearing age. Physical examinations and prenatal services are also offered and include all recommended assessments and information to help women have a healthy pregnancy and baby.

CHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 201 | 2017 Durham County Department of Public Health Communicable Diseases This chapter includes: Vaccine -Preventable Diseases Infectious Dise ases (not sexually transmitted)/ TB Sexually Transmitted Infections Outbreaks and Food Safety CHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 202 | 2017 Durham County Department of Public Health Section 8.01 Vaccine -preventable diseases Overview Vaccines are valuable public health tools used to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), vaccines prevent nearly 42,000 deaths and 20 million cases of disease i n each birth cohort . They provide an estimated savings of $13.6 billion dollars in direct costs.i Vaccines work by imitating an infection and causing an immune response within the body. The body's immune response to vaccines creates memory cells that can quickly be replicated in the future if the body encounters the disease.ii Vaccines prevent against many dangerous and deadly diseases and reduce the overall prevalence of a disease in populations with high immunization rates. It is even possible to comple tely eliminate some infectious diseases through vaccination. When a high proportion of the population is immunized, the spread of disease is reduced because the chain of infection cannot be maintained. This is called herd immunity. The proportion of immuni zed population needed to achieve herd immunity varies by disease, but generally requires vaccination among 80 -95% of the population. Herd immunity is particularly important for vulnerable populations including infants, pregnant women, and immune -compromised individuals, who are unable to receive some vaccination s due to medical reasons.iii Although herd immunity is effective in reducing the spread of disease, continued vaccination is crucial unless a disease has been completely eradicated. As vaccination rates decline in a given population, the proportion of people susceptible to infection increases. Disease can spread faster among these and in severe cases, an epidemic can ensue. Clusters of suscepti ble persons magnifies this problem. Seco ndary Data Infants, Children and Adolescents Though vaccines provide demonstrated benefits to infants, children, and adolescents, there are significant barriers for many parents making a decision about whether or not to vaccinate their children. Commonly cited barriers include perceived vaccine safet y, apprehension regarding administration of multiple vaccines during a single visit, low perceived risk of vaccine -preventable diseases, anxiety related to pain from vaccines, and lack of access to vaccines. One of the most familiar barriers related to vac cine safety is the fear of a causal link between vaccine administration and the development of autism. Although scientific studies have failed to show a causal link, celebrity -led campaigns and scientifically unfounded information disseminated through anti - vaccine news sources continu e to incite fear among parents.iv CHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 203 | 2017 Durham County Department of Public Health Fear that receiving multiple vaccines during a single visit will negatively affect a child's immune system has also been cited as a barrier among parents. However, studies demonstrate that children are exposed to more antigens during a typical day than through vaccinations. Healthy infants ' and children's ' immune systems are fully capable of inciting an appropriate immune response to multiple va ccines given in a single visit.iv To reduce fi nancial barriers related to access to care, North Carolina works with Vaccines for Children, a federal vaccine supply program, to provide vaccines free of charge to eligible children at public and private providers. Children who are Medicaid enrolled, unin sured, American Indian or Alaskan Native qualify . In some cases, underinsured children are also eligible to receive free vaccines at Federally Qualified Health Centers, Regional Health Centers, Local Health Departments, and at some private providers. The North Carolina General Statutes (G.S. 130 -A-152(a)) mandate that each child receive s diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), poliomyelitis, red measles (rubeola) and rubella vaccinations, and that the parent or guardian is responsible for ensuring these requirements are met.vi Further, c hildren in North Carolina are required to receive vaccinations against ten different diseases by the time they enter kindergarten and 12 diseases before entering seventh grade .vii Vaccination rates among children and adolescents in Durham County and North Carolina are displayed in the graphic below. It is important to note that vaccination coverage data for Durham County may be less complete t han data for North Carolina, as the data source for county level data relies upon physicians reporting vaccinations online. Not all providers use the data reporting system and others do not use the system appropriately, which results in incomplete data. The statewide data is validated by the CDC periodically and is more complet e. Compared to North Carolina, children ages 24 -35 months in Durham had lower vaccination rates during 2015 -2016 . The same is true for adolescents, with the exception of varicella vaccination rates. The varicella vaccination rate for adolescents in 2016 was 69.1% compared to 17.4% statewide.viii,ix See Tables 8.01(a) and (b) below for detailed data. Vaccination Cov erage for Children Ages 24 -35 Months, 2015 -2016 Durham County North Carolina Combined 7 -series vaccine (4 DTaP, 3 Polio, 1 MMR, Hib full series, 3 Hep B, 1 Var, 4 PCV) 74.3% Children Ages 24 -35 M onths, 2015 -2016viii,ix CHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 204 | 2017 Durham County Department of Public Health Vaccination Coverage for Adolescents Ages 13 -17 Years, 2016 Durham County North Carolina Hepatitis B (complete) 17.4% Table 8.01(b) Vaccination Coverage for Adolescents Ages 13 -17 Years, 2016viii,ix College Students North Carolina students attending public, private, and religious universities are required to be vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B unless living off -campus AND registering for a combination o f the following: Off-campus courses Evening courses beginning after 5 p.m. Weekend courses No more than four day credit hours in on -campus coursesx In addition to the state mandated vaccines, Duke University requires students to receive a meningococcal vaccination . North Carolina Central University (NCCU) strongly encourages students to be vaccinated for meningitis . Older Adults The vaccine preventable diseases most relevan t to routine vaccination of older adults are influenza, pneumococcal disease and herpes zoster. Although the incidence of influenza is typically highest in children, persons aged 65 years and older are at highest risk fo r complications. Pneumonia, myocardial infarction, stroke, exacerbation of underlying conditions and functional decline are common complications of influenza in older persons. Rates of hospitalization are markedly increased for older persons compared to younger persons. N ationally, approximately 90% of influenza deaths occur among persons aged 65 years and older .xi The risk for influenza -associated death is highest among persons aged 85 years and older, who are 16 times more likely to die from an influenza -associated illne ss than persons aged 65--69 years.xii In Durham County, NC, the influenza and mortality rate for persons aged 65 years and older is 100.3 per 100,000 compared to 3.3 per 100,000 in persons below age 65 years.xiii Pneumococcal disease, caused by the bacterium Streptococcus pneumonia, includes pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD): bacteremia and meningitis. The risk of developing pneumococcal disease increases with age.xiv Cognitive impairment, functional decline, and cardiac disease are well documented complications of pneumococcal disease in older adults.xv Like influenza, hospitalization and death from pneumococcal disease is significantly higher in older CHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 205 | 2017 Durham County Department of Public Health patients compared to younger patients.xvi Interestingly, the incidence of IPD is declining in older adults with the use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in children suggesting indirect protection , or herd immunity . In Durham County, there were no reported cases of pneumococcal meningitis in 2016 in persons a ged 65 years and older and only four cases in North Caroli na in the same age group . The incidence of herpes zoster increases dramatically with aging such that the great majority of zoster cases occur among persons aged 60 years and older. The main complication of zoster is both acute and chronic pain postherpetic neuralgia (complication of shingles which causes burning pain that after shingles rashes and blisters disappear ). Postherpetic neuralgia greatly interferes with the functional status and quality of life of older adults. Patients can suffer from chronic fatigue, insomnia, depression, social isolation and interference with a ctivities of daily living like taking a shower .xvii,xviii Other complications include eye inflammation and visual impairment in the setting of ophthalmic herpes zoster, cranial neuropathies, spinal cord inflammation, and muscle dysfunctio n in the area of the zoster rash .xix Vaccination rates for persons 65 ye ars and older in the United States during 2014 -2015 are displayed below. Compared to pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccination rates, the influenza vaccination rate is highest among older adults in the United States. Vaccination Rate for Persons 65 Yea rs and Older , U.S., 2014 -2015 Figure 8.01(a): Vaccination Rate for Persons 65 Years and Older , U.S., 2014 -2015xx Common barriers to vaccination in older adults include f ear of adverse reactions, concern that vaccination may actually cause disease, fear of the pain of injection or needles, concerns about vaccine efficacy and perceived lack of physician recommendation for vaccination. Lack of transportation and cognitive impairment are barriers that are much more common in older adults than younger a dults. For the live zoster vaccine, la ck of understanding of the harm of herpes zoster by older adults, storage and handling requirements, and cost are additional barriers. Refugees Refugees require age appropriate vaccines recommended for the general U.S. population. Without 73.5% 63.6% Diseases 206 | 2017 Durham County Department of Public Health vaccination records, refugees are considered unvaccinated and are asked to restart the vaccination process. Proof of age appropriate vaccination is required for all refugees applying for a green card. The biggest barriers to vaccinating the refugee population are language and education. The Durham County Department of Public Health utilizes interpreters to communicate with refugees when appropriate to help reduc e language barriers. During 2016, the Durham County Department of Public Health (DCoDPH) Immunizations Program provided vaccines to 513 refugees from countries including Iraq, Congo, Burma, Syria, Somalia and Afghanista n. A total of 2,341 vaccines were supplied to the Refugee Health program. In total, 214 refugees completed their vaccines with DCoDPH .xi Recommended Strategies Promote the North Carolina Immunization Registry (NCIR) to all providers. Immunization pr oviders can access all recorded immunizations administered in North Carolina, regardless of where the immunizations were given. The primary goals of the NCIR are to: o Give patients, parents, health care providers, schools and child care facilities timely access to complete, accurate and relevant immunization data; o Assist in the evaluation of a child's immunization status and identify children who need (or are past due for) immunizations; o Assist communities in accessing their immunization coverage and identifying areas of under -immunizat ion; and o Fulfill federal and state immunization reporting needs.

CHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 209 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 8.02 Infectious diseases (not sexually transmitted)/TB Overview Infectious diseases are caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi, and can be spread directly or indirectly from one person to another. As the foundation of public health practice, many infectious diseases can now be prevented using immunizations, especially among those who receive recommended vaccinations. However, the Tuberculosis ( TB) vaccine (Bacille Calmette [BCG]) given and small ch ildren in countries where TB is prevalent is not widely used in the U.S . The vaccine does not always protect individuals from getting TB .i Infectious food - borne diseases like salmonellosis and campylobacter are not vaccine preventable. Emerging infectious diseases (e.g., Zika virus) and Zoonotic diseases ( e.g., rabies ) have been on the rise in recent years. Seco ndary Data Tuberculosis (TB) TB, an air -borne disease caused by bacteria that often affect the lungs, is one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide . TB is a leading cause of death among people with HIV.ii In 201 6, a total of 219 TB cases were reported in North Carolina , which represents a 10% increase in the rate of cases compa red to 201 5.iii While the rate of TB cases increased statewide and countywide in 2016, the increase i n Durham County was larger at 22.2 %.iv During this time period, t he average TB rate in Durham County was 3.6 per 100,000 persons (see figure 8.02(a) ),v which was higher than the national average of 2.9 per 100,000 .vi Figure 8.02(a) below depicts the trend in TB cases in Durham County and in North Carolina between 2011 and 2016. The TB rate in North Carolina remained relatively stable during this time period, while the rate in Durham County was more variable. TB Trends in Durham County and North Carolina, 2011 -2016 Figure 8.02(a) TB Trends in Durham County and North Carolina 2011 -2016vii 3.33.6 2.52.2 01234 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Population Durham TB Rates NC TB RatesCHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 210 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment In the past few years , TB cases in North Carolina have been almost evenly split between individuals born in the United States and individuals who were born in foreign countries. This trend is shown in Figure 8.02(b) below. In 2016, 50.2% of TB cases occurred among U. S.-born persons and 49.8% cases occurred in foreign -born persons .viii Percent of Tuberculosis Cases in North Carolina by Country of Birth , 2011 -2016 Figure 8.02(b): Percent of Tuberculosis Cases in North Carolina by Country of Birth, 2011 -2016ix Other communicable diseases Based on information provided on the top five reportable communicable diseases in Figure 8.02( c) below , food-borne illnesses Salmonellosis and Campylobacter Infection are among the top three reportable communicable diseases. However, as the number of reported Salmonellosis cases in North Carolina decreased from 2015 to 2016, cases increased in Durham County. In contrast, as the number of Campylobacter cases in North Caroli na increased from 2015 to 2016 , cases decreased in Durham County. This was also the case with reported Shigellosis , a bacterial infection spread by oral -fecal transmission . In both the state and the county , Shigellosis cases in Durham County decreased by half from 2015 to 2016.x As shown in Figure 8.02(c), reportable communicable diseases in Durham represent a small proportion of what is observed for the state as whole. Reportable Communicable Diseases, Durham County and North Carolina, 2016 Figure 8.02( c) NC Reportable Communicable Diseases in Durham County and North Carolina 2015 -2016xi 55.7%50.2% 44.3% 49.8% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% 2011 States Foreign-born 2134 1465 InfectionRocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF)Shigellosis CryptosporidiosisNumber of Carolina DurhamCHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 211 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Disparities Persons reported with TB are classified as U.S. -born or foreign -born (i.e., born outside of the United States, U.S. insular areas, and the freely associated states [except persons born abroad to a U.S. citizen parent ]) persons .xii (Insular areas include American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S . Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Freely associated states are the sovereign nations that have signed compacts of free association with the United States to include the Federated States of Micronesia, Republic of the Ma rshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.) Although the overall rate of TB in the United States has declined substantially since 1992, the rate of decrease has been much smaller among foreign -born persons than U.S. -born persons. Among TB cases reported in 2015 in the United States , foreign -born persons accounted for 66.4% cases. The case rate among foreign -born persons (15.1 cases per 100,000 persons) was approximately 13 times higher than among U.S. -born persons (1.2 cases per 100,000 persons) . In 2015, there was a 3.2% decrease in TB incidence among foreign -born persons, but a n 8.4% decrease in TB incidence among U.S. -born persons .xiii The majority of foreign -born cases are among persons who have been in the United States five years or longer . In North Carolina, the number of TB cases from 2011 to 2016 disaggregated by country of birth indicate that 691 ( 53.8%) of the TB cases occurred among U.S .-born residents of North Carolina and 593 (46.2%) cases occurred among foreign -born persons .xiv Gaps Most people who become infected with TB do not get sick because their bodies are able to fight the germs, leading to the develop ment of a latent TB infection (LTBI). If left untreated, the infection can progress to active TB disease. Both LTBI and active T B disease require medical attention . Free care is provided for individual s with LTBI who are considered to be at high risk for infection through local health departments in North Carolina. North Carolina and Durham County in particular need to strengthen e xisting programs such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funded programs to identify and treat active TB disease . Increas ing measures such as conduct ing targeted testing is also needed to identify and treat LTBI among populations at high risk to accelerate progress toward TB elimination. According to the Durham County Depart ment of Public Health website, TB skin testing can be requested by individuals who are at risk for developing TB infection .xv Programs that increase measures to identify and treat LTBI of those considered to be at high risk without requiring someone to individually requesting the skin test would be beneficial . Ultimately d ecisions on LTBI treatment should take into consideration the indi vidual 's risk for developing TB disease compared with the risk of adverse reactions to TB medication .xvi Emerging Issues Zika virus disease cases were first reported in the United States in 2016 and immediately became a nationally notifiable condition . In 2016 , Durham County saw an emergence of Zika virus, a disease spread through infected Aedes species mosquitos. In North Carolina, 97 laboratory -CHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 212 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment confirmed symptomatic Zika virus cases were reported.xvii Of th ose, nine cases were reported in Durham County.xviii Many Zika cases are likely to go unreported because people infected with Zika virus rarely get sick, and hence do not realize that they have been infected. Provisional data in 2016 indicate that 5,102 laboratory -confirmed symptomatic Zika virus disease cases were reported in the United States. Approximately 4,830 of these cases occurred among travelers returning from affected areas . Of these, 224 cases were acquired through presumed local mosquito -borne transmission in Florida (218) and Texas (6), and 48 cases were acquired through other routes including sexual transmission (46), laboratory transmission (1), and person -person through unknown route (1) .xix In 2017, provisional data indicate that 278 laboratory -confirmed symptomatic Zika virus disease cases have been reported in the United States. Of these, 274 cases occurred among travelers returning from affected areas, three cases were acquired through sexual transmission , and one case was acquired through presumed local mosquito -borne transmission . There were five laboratory -confirmed symptomatic cases in North Carolina in 2017 .xx Recommended Strategies Current programs to identify and treat active TB disease need to be m aintain ed and strengthen ed in order to lower incidence and move toward s TB elimination. Additionally, measures to identify and treat latent TB infection (LTBI), including targeted testing and treatment need to be increased. Hepatitis B and C have been on the rise in North Carolina in conjunction with the increase in the use of heroin and other injected opioid drugs. Preventing the sharing of needles is one of the main strategies for curbing the spread of hepatitis B and C . People can also get vacc inated for hepatitis B. It is important to educate people on hepatitis B including modes of transmission, signs and symptoms, as well as prevention and treatment. A consumer education program need s to be developed and provided to help prevent the spread of foodborne disease s in Durham County. This can be modeled from the Wake County's Produce Pro program .xxi Current Initiatives & Activities Durham County Department of Public Health has: Communicable Disease Prevention and Control Program provid es services to residents of Durham County , including investigation and reporting of communicable diseases while enforcing statutes and rules through implementation of appropriate measures . http://dcopublichealth.org/services/communicable -diseases/communicable -diseases TB Clinic provides routine TB control services are offered, and people who request for TB skin testing are assessed and tested either at a cost or none, depending on their risk category for developing TB. http://dcopublichealth.org/services/communicable - diseases/tuberculosis Durham County Department of Public Health D ivision of Environmental Health provides regulatory oversight in addition to guidance and education relevant to multiple types of foodservice establishments.

CHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 216 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 8.03 Sexually transmitted infections Overview HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) significantly impact both Durham County and North Carolina broadly. STIs include a broad class of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, parasites and yeasts, that are transmitted through sexual contact .i,ii HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia are discussed in this report. STI s account for 20 million new infections and $16 billion in medical costs in the United States , annually .iii STIs are of notable public health significance, impacting the morbidity and mortality of a community. They can cause infertility of women, sterility in men, ectopic pregnancies, cancer, cirrhosis or liver failure, a nd early death .iv,v Durh am county residents are particularly vulnerable to STI infection . Durham county ranks 5th in the state for the three -year average rate of newly diagnose d HIV cases and 1st in the state for newly diagnosed earl y syphilis cases between 2013 and 2015 .vi In particular, young people and people of color have the highest rates of HIV and STI infection. While STI s are both prevalent in Durham and of great public health significance, ameliorating ST I rates in any communit y, including Durham, is complex. Prevention, testing and treatment are critical elements to local infection control efforts, however, the risk factors for HIV and other STIs are complex. There is a dynamic in terplay between the prevalence of STI s, prevention strategies, and social determinates of health , including race and ethnicity, income and social c apital, and sexual orientation .vii,viii,ix,x Below is a discuss ion of the burden of HIV/STIs in Durham county, health disparities, and current initiatives and activities. Primary Data From the 2016 Durham Cou nty Community Health Assessment survey :xi A random sample of Durham residents was asked to select three priority health issues in Durham County. Of the full county sample, 1 4.0% of respondents considered STI s to be a priority health issue.xi CHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 217 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Seco ndary Data HIV The rate of new cases of HIV in Durham County decreased slightly from 2013 to 2015, although Durham County continues to have a higher incidence rate than the state.

First, young people, ages 20 -29, have the highest incidence rates for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea and chlamydia. Second, men are more likely than women to be infected with all STIs and HIV (exc luding chlamydia). Lastly, when examined by race, African American s have the highest incidence rates for all STIs and HIV. In 2015 in Durham County, the rate of HIV infection for Black residents was nearly 9 times that of Whites, with rates of 39.3 and 4.6 pe r 100,000, respectively .xii Overall , young black men who have sex with men (MSM) seem to have the greatest risk of syphilis infection .xii In 2015, the early syphilis rate among black men ages 20 -29 was 12 times greater than the county average .xii Additionally , the rate of early syphilis infection was significantly higher for men (541.1) than women (87.3), potentially indicating infection through male same sex relationships .xii Furthermore , nearly 25% of the early syphilis cases diagnosed in 2015 were black men coinfected with HIV .xii Early syphilis infection is a risk factor for HIV and young black MSM in Durham need s upport to prevent HIV infection. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), three complex risk factors make people of color more susceptible to STI and HIV infection .xiii First, the higher prevalence of HIV and STIs in communities of color put individuals at a higher risk of infection at each sexual 8.03(d) Rate of new infections per 100,000 by Race, Durham County, 2013 -2015 Syphilis of infections per 100,000 by Race, Durham County, 2013 -2015 Non-Hispanic Black or African-American Hispanic Non-Hispanic WhiteCHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 219 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment encounter , since most people are more likely to engage in sexual relationships with people who are from the same racial or et hnic background . Second, racial discrimination may keep people of color from seeking testing or treatment since they are more likely to be stigmatized for risky sexual behavior or id entify as a sexual minority. Finally, socioeconomic risk factors (including poverty, trauma, incarcerati on and lack of access to health care) are more common in communities of color. This perpetuate s a system that keeps people of col or at greater risk of infection .xiii Recommended Strategies Testing continues to increase acr oss Durham and North Carolina. HIV rapid testing continues to expand with the State offering a variety (5) of rapid tests to community health centers, emergency departments, health departments and community -based organizations. The State is no w offering rapid Syphilis test kit s free within selected counties to increase testing. In addition, the State Lab of Public Health has provided HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) lab processing free of charge to funded community -based organizations and local he alth departments to expa nd testing . Several agencies also offer HIV/STI screening and testing at no cost to the client. Durham has responded to historically high rates of HIV infection, specifically among young black men who have sex with men (MSM), by championing pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV prevention tool. The Durham County Department of Public Health (DCoDP H), Duke University Medical Center, and Lincoln Community Health Center have worked to make PrEP available to high-risk clients in Durham since 2015. The DCoDPH has partnered with PrEP prescribing agencies to smoothly refer high risk clients to a PrEP provider, by offering free HIV/STI testing and counseling. Duke Infectious Disease Clinic and Lincoln Primary Care Clinic have both dedicated providers and clinical time to prescribing PrEP to high -risk c lients. As a result, h undreds of high -risk individu als have been referred for PrEP in Durham County . DCoDPH serves as a lead agency for Integrated Targeted Testing Services (ITTS) for Region VI which includes 11 North Carolina counties . Durham works with subcontractors and North Carolina Central Universi ty to increase and coordinate the amount of HIV and STIs testing done among high-risk populations within Region VI. In addition, ITTS is charged with getting individuals who are newly diagnosed as HIV -positive into care, tracking all cl ients who test posit ive for STI s within the region to ensure care, treatment, active referrals and reduce duplication of testing within the region. The health department also contracts with a community -based organization to implement safe spaces to effectively identify, engag e and help to retain MSM living with HIV in care and treatment. Durham Knows , a joint project of the HIV/STI committee of the Partnership for a Healthy Durham and the Durham County Department of Public Health, is a public health campaign promoting HIV testing . One goal of the campaign is for everyone in DURHAM age 15 to 65, to be tested at least once in th eir life time.

Accessed 20 Communicable Diseases 222 | 2017 Durham County Department of Public Health Section 8.04 Outbreaks and food safety Overview The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) defines a foodborne outbreak as two or more people getting the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink. Most foodborne illness is associated with viral or bacterial pathogens that find their way into food through poor hygienic practices and poor food handling .i Other types of foodborne illness can occur due to food adulteration or contamination and include biological, physical, or chemical contamination. The contamination may be intentional or unintentional. Because communicable diseases, including foodborne illnesses, can have so much impact on the population, the surveillance and control of such diseases is an important part of protecting the public's health. The Communicable Disease Branch of the Division of Public Health primarily deals with infectious diseases that are reportable by law to the state health department. Physicians, schoo l administrators, child care operators, medical facilities and operators of restaurants and other food or drink establishments must report cases or suspected cases of reportable diseases to their local health department, which in turn reports this informat ion to the N.C. Division of Public Health (G.S. \u00a7 103A -140). Following the initial notification, the Durham County Department of Public Health will begin an epidemiologic investigation. A communicable disease nurse with the aid of environmental health staff, or epidemiologist will collect demographic, clinical, epidemiologic and sometimes case contact information and will verify that a reported case meets the reporting requirements in the standardized case definitions. The collected case information is entered into the North Carolina Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NC EDSS) for confidential reporting to the Division of Public Health .ii Primary Data Norovirus, although not reportable by law , is the leading cause of illness and outbreaks from contaminated food in the United States and Durham County. The virus is extremely tiny and a very small amount of virus particles can make a person sick. Most norovirus contamination occ urs when infected persons have stool or vomit on their hands and touch food or food preparation surfaces. Tiny droplets of vomit from an infected person can spread through the air and find their way onto food and preparation surfaces. Produce can become contaminated in the field while shellfish may contain the virus if harvested from contaminated waters. People infected with norovirus shed billions of particles and are most contagious when exhibiting symptoms and during the first few days after recovery. The virus causes inflammation of the stomach or intestines or both (acute gastroenteritis). Onset of symptoms typically occurs from 12 to 48 hours after exposure and commonly include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and stomach pain. Infected persons may als o experience fever, headache, and body aches. Most people recover within one to three days. CHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 223 | 2017 Durham County Department of Public Health However, extreme vomiting and diarrhea may cause severe dehydration and present dangerous complications for older adults and children .iii There were 19 total confirmed Noro virus or Noro -like illness outbreaks in Durham County from 2014 through 2017. Many of those outbreaks occurred in Adult Care facilities and schools. It's not uncommon for more than half of residents as well as a large number of staff members to become ill during outbreaks. Noteworthy outbreaks include 30 of 70 residents reported ill, 159 of 670 students reported ill, and 20 of 40 staff members reported ill ( three separate Durham County outbreaks). The Durham County Department of Public Heal th's Communicable Disease staff, Environmental Health staff, and Medical Director worked together to educate facility operators and suggest control measures designed to limit disease spread and decrease outbreak persistence. Identifying cases early, along with rapid deployment of control measures was, and always is, paramount in limiting disease spread and the severity of outbreaks .iv Durham County's Environmental Health Division completed 6,948 foodservice inspections for FY15 through FY17. During those 3 years, they also conducted 757 \"Priority\" and \"Priority Foundation\" verification visits. Priority and Priority Foundation categories are those that are most likely to lead to illness if not maintained within compliance parameters.v While the division is a regulatory agency, one of their primary functions and services provided is that of education and guidance for food establishment operators and their staff. Building goodwill and trust promotes more effective regulation and greater levels of compliance thus leading to safer consumer options in Durham County. Posted inspection scores located near establishment entrances along with detailed inspection reports online are tools that consumers use to empower themselves in making informed decisions that could directly impact their health .v Common pathogens associated with foodborne illness in Durham County include E. coli, Campylobacter, Hepatitis A, Salmonella, Listeria, Cryptosporidium, and Shigella . Of the seven listed, Salmonella was by far the leading cause of foodborne illness during 2015 -2017 in Durham County (see figure 8.04a) .vi Confirmed Cases of Foodborne Illness, Durham County, 2015 -2017 Figure 8.04 (a): foodborne illness , Durham County , 2015 -2017vi 232 150 0 216 123 564 09 8 130 336 0712 010203040506070 Number of 224 | 2017 Durham County Department of Public Health There have been no major foodborne illness outbreaks in Durham County since May 2013 when a catering event caused at least 41 persons to become ill with Norovirus. Many reports of foodborne illness do not involve large numbers of people or clusters. Durham County Environmental Health's Food, Lodging, and Institutions program received 576 foodservice complaints for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. Of those complaints, 148 were directly associated with illnesses and many involved more than one person. While most were not officially diagnosed, many cases report ed symptoms consistent with Noro virus infection .v Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues An emerging issue for Durham is the overwhelmingly large number of Mobile Food Units (MFUs) permitted by the County. Second only to Charlotte -Mecklenburg, Durham County has roughly 150 MFUs. The transient nature of MFU operations makes cases of associate d illness hard to track. An outbreak could also impact operations of many others as food preparation spaces are shared within common commissaries and shared kitchens. Recommended Strategies Continue educational efforts with foodservice and institution staff pertaining to outbreak prevention and safe food handling methods. Environmental Health staff should adopt a \"Perfect Service\" approach to inspections and regulatory activities concentrating on gaining compliance through education and partnerships. Environmental Health should enter into the FDA Standards program which will help ensure a more uniform and correct application of codes and rules. This should result in greater compliance and lower risk of foodborne illness in Durham County. Increase effort s to educate food employees about their responsibilities to report to Persons in Charge conditions about their health as it relates to food and possible spread of foodborne illness. Current Initiatives & Activities Durham County Environmental Health holds an annual in -service for Mobile Food Unit and Commissary operators. The intent is to help the operators better understand the codes and requirements that must be followed to remain legal and to operate in a more responsible and safe manner thus red ucing the risk of foodborne illness not only in Durham, but in counties across the state. The NC Food Code was adopted by North Carolina i n September of 2012 . The code allows for a more \"science based\" approach to foodservice inspections. The higher quality, more \"food driven\" inspection concentrates on aspects of food handling that are more likely to cause foodborne illness. Durham County Environmental Health staff have become more CHAPTER 8 Communicable Diseases 225 | 2017 Durham County Department of Public Health effective in applying the code and gaining compliance resulting in lower risk of foodborne illness. http://ehs.ncpublichealth.com/faf/d ocs/foodprot/NC -FoodCodeManual -2009 -FINAL.pdf Durham County Department of Public Health Division of Environmental Health provides regulatory oversight in addition to guidance and education relevant to multiple types of foodservice establishments.

Factors CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 229 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment that largely contribute to this pervasive public health issue include speeding, driving while intoxicated (DWI) , driving while distracted (DWD), non -use or misuse of seatbelts/child restraints, poor conditions on the road and the vehicle and the driver's risk -taking behavior , inexperience and immaturity. Figure 9.01(a) below shows the trend in deaths resulting from unintentional motor vehicle injuries in North Carolina, Durham, and peer counties. The mortality rate resulting from unintentional motor vehicle injuries was lower in Durham compared to the state average and the rates in Cumberland, Guilford, and Wayne co unties.

Unintentional Motor Vehicle Injury Related Deaths, Rolling Averages 2009 -2013xv Unintentional Poisonings Unintentional poisonings are the second leading cause of unintentional injury -related deaths in North Carolina and the third leading cause in Durham County during 2010 -2013 .xvi Efforts to improve pain management have resulted in quadrupled rates of opioid prescribing, which propelled a tightly correlated epidemic of addiction, overdose, and death from prescription opioids that is now further evolving to include increasing use and overdoses of heroin and illicitly produced fentanyl .xvii The rate of unintentional poisoning deaths has increase d by more than 300% since 1999 in Durham County , from 7 deaths in 1999 to 29 fatali ties in 2016 .xviii Unintentional poisoning mortality rates for Durham County, peer counties, and the state are displayed in Figure 9.01(b) . The NC Injury and Violence Prevention Branch has estimated the average medical costs and work loss costs from medication and drug fatalities based on 2010 prices, then indexed to 2015 prices in the state. The following estimates do not include costs associ ated with treatment and recovery. 2009-2013 2012-2016CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 230 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment In Durham County in 2016, total medical costs add ed up to $181,380 and work lost costs for w ere $40,954,195. This is a per capita cost of $134.34 for each person in Durham County.xix Figure 9.01 (b) below reflects the upward trend in the unintentional poisoning mortality rate in North Carolina and Durham, Cumberland, Guilford and Wayne counties from 2009 to 2016 . Since 1999 , the number of unintentional medication and drug poisoning dea ths increased statewide from 234 to 1,726. In Durham C ounty, the number of deaths during this same time period increased from 7 to 29 .xx Age-Adjusted Unintentional Poisoning Mortality Rate , Rolling Averages 2009 -2016 Figure 9.01(b). Unintentional Poisoning Mortality Rate, Rolling Averages 2009 -2016xxi Unintentional Falls Unintentional falls were the fourth leading cause of unintentional injury related deaths and the leading cause of injury -related emergency d epartment visits in Durham County during 2010 - 2013 .xxii In adults, alcohol and drugs are large contributors to unintentional falls; and in children, contributing factors include inadequate supervision around playground equipment, trampolines, stairs and open windows. In the elderly, however, the list of contri buting factors to unintentional falls is longer, and may include: polypharmacy (the use of multiple medications); environment, such as poor lighting and irregular floor surfaces; and physical and cognitive deficits, such as impaired gait or strength, alter ation in mentation, acute or chronic medical conditions.xxiii An estimated 10% of those persons over 65 will die of complications related to a fall, and falls are associated with 40% of admissions to long term facilities.xxiv Additionally, persons over the age of 65 in North Carolina account for 88% of all deaths related to falls and 73% of nonfatal hospitalizations related to falls. It is estimated that costs associated with injuries due to falls in North Carolina among persons aged 65 and older 2012-2016CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 231 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment The tre nd in the age -adjusted mortality rate related to falls is shown below for North Carolina and four peer counties, including Durham. Although the mortality rate associated with falls has been somewhat variable in each of the counties highlighted bel ow, the rate at the state level has been increasing since 2010.xxvi The unintentional fall mortality rate among older adults in North Carolina and Durham County during 2014 -2016 was significantly higher than that for the general population, at 72.4 and 68.7 per 100,000 population, respectively.xxvii Age-Adjusted Unintentional Fall Mortality Rate , Durha m Carolina, 2010-2016 Figure 9.01 (c ).

During 2012 -2016 in Durham County the crude unintentional mortality rate associated with falls was 1.1 among the population aged 64 and younger compared to 66.1 in the population aged 2014-2016CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 232 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Emerging Issues Unintentional prescription drug pois oning, mostly from painkillers is a growing epidemic in North Carolina. Prescription drugs are commonly sold like illegal drugs such as heroin, marijuana and cocaine. Abuse of the prescription drugs is perceived by many teens and young adults to be \"safe r\" because it is a drug that has been prescribed by a doctor. In 2010, a White House white paper on drug abuse indicated that nearly 56% of people 12 years of age or older who abuse drugs obtained them from the household medicine chest, a family member or friend.40 Safety issues emerge because the abuser does not know the appropriate dose for their age and weight, whether it will have an adverse reaction to other medications (prescribed, illicit or over the counter) being taken, how the medicine will react if mixed w ith alcohol or if they will develop an allergic reaction to the medicine. Prescription medicines are more readily available to this age group at home, in school and at social gatherings.

CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 235 | 2017 Durham County Community He alth Assessment Section 9.0 2 Intimate partner violence (IPV) Overview Intimate partner violence (IPV) refers to any physical, sexual, or psychological ly/emotional ly aggressive behavior that is part of a systematic pattern of power and control perpetrated by one intimate partner against another .i IPV can occur among heterosexual or same- sex couples , and affects people of all ages, races, and income levels .ii More than 37.3% of women and 30.9% of men in the United States have experienced physical or sexual violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime .iii IPV affects not only primary victims (those who are abused), but also has a substantial negative effect on secondary victims (e.g., children, family members, friends and co -workers), and the community at large. Victims often experience social and physical problems and are at increased risk of future victimization. Children exposed to IPV are at higher risk for adverse life outcomes including victimization, physical health problems, depression, and substance abuse.iv While common depictions of domestic violence involve physical abuse, intimate partner violence takes many forms including emotional abuse, isolation, financial control, intimidation, and threats. Consequences for a victim's mental health can i nclude depression, anxiety, and attempted suicide .v Approximately half of women in violent relationships are physically injured by their partners and many sustain multiple injuries . vi Injuries range from minor (e.g., scratches and bruises) to chronic and stress- induced (e.g., fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome) to severe (e.g., traumatic brain injury, consequences of strangulation, death) .vii Long -term effects of the trauma of IPV include decreased overall health, higher likelihood of reporting a disability, higher rates of HIV and poorer HIV -related outcomes .viii In 2015 , more than half of all female homicides in the U .S. were related to intimate partner violence.ix Victims are at the highest risk of being killed immediately after leaving an abusive relationship. If a victim of IPV is planning to end the relationship, it is critical that a safety plan is established. Primary Data IPV is also a serious concern for Durham youth. The 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data indicate that 7.9% of Durham high school student respondents had been hit, sla mmed into something, or injured with an object or weapon by someone they were dating during the preceding year.x Secondary Data Durham Crisis Response Center (DCRC) is the only agency in Durham with a dedicated 24 -hour CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 236 | 2017 Durham County Community He alth Assessment phone line to assist victims of domestic and sexual violence. In 2016, DCRC received 1, 875 calls for domestic violence on its English and Spanish crisis lines .xi The Durham Police Department's Domestic Violence Unit is dedicated to handling cases of IPV in Durham. In 2016, 310 cases of intimate partner violence were reported, including 18 rapes/sexual offenses and 10 robberies. In addition, Durham Police investigated one intimate partner homicide in 2014, 3 in 2015, and 3 in 2016.xii Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Although IPV affects all groups of people, certain communities have been found to be disproportionately affected. Women and racial and ethnic minorities are more frequently exposed to IPV and appear to experience more severe consequences than men and White women. For example, African -American and Native American women have been found to have higher rates of IPV and suffer from more negative consequences such as homicide and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD ) than White women .xiii,xiv Socioeconomic disparities experienced by women and racial and ethnic minorities can intersect with the control tactics often used by abusive partners . This further makes these communities vulnerable to abuse, its consequences, and access to resources (e.g., access to health and so cial services) that may protect them .xv Language and immigration status can also serve as a significant barrier to accessing help in IPV situations, especially among undocumented immigrants. In Durham County, the Hispanic/Latino population is the fastest growing minority group, increasing from 7.6 % in 2000 to 13.4% in 2015. xviiixvi,xvii To better serve the growing Hispanic/Latino population, DCRC has increased its staff to offer services for this population including a Spanish Crisis Line and bilingual legal assistance . DCRC serves all victims of IPV, regardless of immigration status . Although control tactics used by abusers of undocumented immigrants include fostering fear of deportation, these services can provide access to legal protections covered by the Violence Against Women Act . The act provide s victims of crime and their family members with temporary visas . There are also special concerns regarding IPV within Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex (LGBTQQI) communities. Research demonstrates that LGBTQQI individuals experience additional barriers to accessing help . These barriers includ e some legal definition s of IPV that exclude same- sex couples, stigma and discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation, a fear of being \"outed,\" and lack of access to high quality, LGBTQQI -friendly services, among others .xix Additionally, first responders such as police may not correctly identify violence as being IPV when the victim and perpetrator are of the same sex, leading to an underestimation of the problem and a lost opportunity to provide appropriate referrals to resources . In Durham, shelters have been working on various initiatives to make their accommodations and services accessible to the diverse LGBTQQI communities. DCRC has been collaborating with the LGBTQ Center of Durham to develop, implement, and evaluate outreach and services for th ese members of the Durham community . Individuals with physical, cognitive, or developmental disabilities are another vulnerable group. Research indicates that both wom en and men with disabilities experience a higher prevalence of CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 237 | 2017 Durham County Community He alth Assessment IPV.xx,xxi This is problematic as victims with disabilities may not be aware that the abuse is taking place, and are less likely or able to report the abuse and access services. Although IPV occurs more frequently among women, men also experience abuse and may be less likely to report it and access services. The same social norms that ascribe strong, controlling, and aggressive behaviors work to stigmatize men who are victimized as weak . xxii Addi tionally, male victims of IPV may experience limited access to services as shelters have not traditionally permitted male residents in order to protect the safety of women. In Durham, DCRC provide s services to all victims regardless of sex at birth, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Recommended Strategies IPV is an important determinant of health which is often overlooked in public health efforts. Better surveillance data is needed to estimate the extent and nature of the problem among Durham residents and disparities experienced by vulnerable sub -populatio ns. This data can also be used to evaluate the impact of public health strategies. Questions from national surveys such as the National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey should be incorporated into future community health assessments to obtain a population -based assessment of IPV which can complement data available from the YRBS, DCRC, and law enforcement . Given the widespread prevalence and consequence of IPV, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends preventing IPV before it occurs . xxiii Prevention strategies that promote healthy, respectful and nonviolent relationships, and address individual, relationship, community, and societal influences are recommended. Several school -based programs have been demonstrated to be effective in increasing knowledge and changing attitudes related to IPV among youth, but more strategies are needed to build skills related to intimate relationships and address the role of bystanders . xxiv The U.S. Preventative Taskforce recommends that clinicians r outinely screen women of childbearing age for IPV using screening tools that have been validated for this purpose. Screening is recommended only when providers are able to provide or refer victims to effective intervention services . xxv A variety of intervent ions for women have been found to be effective in addressing IPV, including counseling, home visits, referrals to community services such as DCRC, mentoring support, and information cards. If women decide to leave a violent relationship, a safety plan is needed to mitigate against the increased risk victims of IPV face when leaving an abusive relationship. Many victims of IPV have limited resources and extensive needs including the need for housing, legal assistance, counseling, employment, transportation , and other forms of formal and informal support . Navigating the complex systems can be difficult and re- traumatizing for victims. Durham continues to improve its collaborative efforts across disciplines to minimize the traumatic impact on IPV victims and increase access to all services, regardless of a victim's point of entry into the system. New and ongoing programs to create a more coordinated and victim -centered system include the Durham County Domestic Violence Response Team and a new Family Justice Ce nter located within the Durham County Courthouse .

CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 241 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 9.0 3 Sexual violence Overview Sexual violence encompasses a broad array of offenses from rape to sexual assault to sexual offenses involving no physical contact such as voyeurism and verbal threats of sexual assault. The term \"force\" includes psychological as well as physical coercion. While North Carolina has maintained a narrower definition of rape, the Durham Police Department uses the same definition for reporting as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI): \"Penetration, no matter how sli ght, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. Attempts or assaults to commit rape are also included; however, statutory rape and incest are excluded .\" i Simi lar to other crimes, including intimate partner violence, sexual violence is about power and control of one individual over another .ii While sexual violence affects individuals of all ages, recent research has highlighted the frequency of assault and dating violence among young people, including middle and high school students .iii Easy and ubiquitous access to technology can lead to cyber -bullying, sharing of explicit photos, and grooming youth for commercial exploitation. Although considerable focus rem ains on sexual assaults on college campuses, youth are experiencing sexual violence as young teens. Education about consent and healthy relationships is needed before youth graduate from high school. The trauma of sexual violence continues to be a signifi cant problem with far -reaching negative effects on not only the primary victims, but also the victims' loved ones (secondary victims), the Durham community, and society as a whole. Primary victims of sexual violence often experience physical, psychological and behavioral health concerns, many of which can become chronic without adequate and appropriate treatment. Some possible health consequences associated with the trauma of sexual violence include chronic disease, gynecological complications, depression, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and increased likelihood of engaging in risky behaviors, including substance abuse and unprotected sex . iv,v Individuals who have experienced sexual assault are at increased risk for future victimization and suicide.vi,vii Primary Data According to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey ( YRBS ) in 2015, approximately 8.9% of high school student s in Durham County reported having been physically forced to have sexual intercourse when they did not want to. Rates were similar across races and ethnicities, with 7.8% of African -Americans , 8.3% of Hispanic and Latinos, 7.9% of whites, and 13.7% of people of other races reporting forced sexual intercourse. CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 242 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Secondary Data Crimes Reported to Police National research estimates that 43.9% of women and 23.4% of men have experienced rape or other sexual violence during their lifetimes .viii In the city of Durham in 2016, the Durham Police Department investigated 78 rapes of female and male victims ranging in age from 9 -59.ix Contrary to myths of \"stranger danger,\" more than 85% of these rapes were committed by a perpetrator known to the victim, as shown below in Figure 9.03(a). In addition, Durham Police investigated 132 cases of sexual offenses in 2016. In 20 15, only an estimated 32% of rape or sexual assaults were reported to the police.x For a variety of reasons, many individuals who have experienced a sexual assault do not report to law enforcement while seeking services from other providers, including healthcare and victim service agencies. Stigma, fear of being blamed or not believed, and normalization of violence or unhealthy behaviors contribute to victims underreporting and not seeking services. Reported Rapes by Relationship to Offender, City of Durham, 2016 Figure 9.03 (a). Reported Rapes by Relationship to Offender, City of Durham, 2016ix Reported Rapes by Age, City of Durham, 2016 While Figure 9.03(b) shows a wide age-range of rape victims who reported to Durham Police Department in 2016, the age of highest risk is 18 -24 years. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey for 1995- 2013, c ollege -age females are at highest risk of sexual violence. While the problem of campus sexual violence is significant , 114556101131 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 by Age, City of Durham, 2016i CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 243 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment females ages 18-24 who are not enrolled in post -secondary education are 1.2 times more likely to experience sexual assault or victimizati on compared to female s of the same age enrolled in post - secondary education .xi The Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act , a 2013 amendment to the federal Jeanne Clery Act and special White House taskforce on sexual violence on college campuses, has called upon colleges and university to increase transparency about the extent and nature of sexual violence on college campuses .xii,xiii Duke University 's sexual assault experiences survey , conducted in 2016, found that 40% of undergraduate females and 10% of males reported being victims of sexual assault since enrolling at Duke, with African -American, Hispanic, and gay, lesbian and bisexual undergraduate students reporting the highest rates of sexual assault .xiv In 2015, various criminal offenses resulting from rape w ere reported at Duke University (13 charges) and North Carolina Central University (8 charges)xv. These rates likely underestimate rape and other forms of sexual violence and may be more indicative of the success of institutions in reporting the problem. Victim Services Durham Crisis Response Center (DCRC) is the only agency in Durham County with the sole mission of offering comprehensive services to support victims of sexual and intimate partner violence. Victims contact DCRC through their English and S panish crisis lines, at the county courthouse, and by referrals from other agencies. DCRC works closely with Duke Health Systems at both Duke and Duke Regional to accompany victims undergoing forensic evidence collection by specially -trained Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANEs). In 2016, DCRC received 443 calls about sexual violence on their crisis line and advocates accompanied 162 victims at the hospitals . xvi Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Underreporting of sexual violence continues to be a significant problem in Durham and across the country. Victims may choose not to report their experiences for many reasons including guilt, self - blame, fear that they would not be believed, and lack of trust in the criminal justice system . xviiixvii Male victims of sexual violence may face additional barriers to reporting such as stigma related to social norms ascribed to males that label male victims as being weak , and lack of concern from the criminal justice system for male victims . Race, ethni city, class, language and immigration status often serve as significant barriers to accessing help following sexual violence. In a national study on sexual violence among Latinas, only 21% sought any form of formal help and only 6.6% of victims sought services from the criminal justice system . xix Immigration -related factors, language barriers, and lack of knowledge of where to access services may serve as additional barriers. Durham Crisis Response Center (DCRC) provide s culturally and linguistically appropri ate services to Latinos and other immigrants to overcome the lack of trust and fear of deportation that often interferes with seeking services. Research indicates that members of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Questioning, Intersex (LGBTQQI) communities face a greater risk of being sexually assaulted in their lifetimes CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 244 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment than heterosexuals .xx Transgender individuals are particularly vulnerable with approximately 1 out 2 people identifying as transgender reporting sexual abuse or assault in their lifetime .xxi DCRC, NCCU, and Duke University all have initiative s to serve the unique needs of this community. Individuals with disabilities and the elderly are also particularly vulnerable to sexual violence . The rate of violent crimes, including rape an d sexual assault, against people with disabilities is more than three times that of people without disabilities . xxiiixxii Individual s with disabilities and the elderly have additional barriers to accessing help, as they are more likely to be dependent on others, including the perpetr ator, and may lack resources. Additionally, service providers are often ill - prepared to address the unique needs of th ese population s. Inmates in jails and prisons are at high risk of sexual violence. In 2012, researchers estimated that 4% of state and federal prison inmates and 3.2% of jail inmates had reported sexual victimization by another inmate or by a facility staff member in the past 12 months xxiv. Prison staff at the Federal Correctional Institution in Butner is working with Du ke University Health System , DCRC, and local agencies to provide appropriate services to prisoners who have been sexually assaulted. Recommended Strategies Given the underreporting of sexual violence, continuing to monitor lifetime and past -year exposure to sexual violence using population -based strategies that do not rely on disclosure to a service provider or criminal justice entity is essential. While data for sexual violence are available for students (e.g., YRBS, university climate surveys), similar data are not available for the general Durham community. Including questions related to sexual violence in future Durham Community Health Assessments would al low for better understanding of the prevalence in Durham and the effectiveness of interventions. Primary prevention programs to reduce exposure to sexual violence and identify and intervene early are also needed. In a recent systematic review of preventi on strategies for sexual violence perpetration, the CDC identified three primary prevention strategies as effective: xxv Safe Dates, a school based prevention program for 8th and 9th grade students addressing sexual violence in dating relationships . DCRC cur rently provides this program at no charge to some schools and youth groups in Durham.xxvi Shifting Boundaries, a comprehensive program addressing sexual harassment, sexual violence, and dating violence that includes an environmental school -wide approach that includes rules, \"hot spot\" maps, temporary school -based restraining orders, and posters. xxvii 1994 U.S. Violence Against Women Act , a law aimed at increasing the prosecution and penalties associated with sexual violence, protecting victims, and funding research and programs addressing sexual violence. xxviii ,xxix Studies by the National Institute of Justice have also noted that Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) programs and Sexual Assault Response Teams (SART) improve the quality of health care CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 245 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment for victims , the quality of forensic evidence collected , and lead to increased rates of prosecution over time .xxx Duke University Health System employs a roster of SANEs to respond to sexual assault cases in the Emergency Departments of both Duke Hospital and Duke Region al Hospital. In addition, Durham Crisis Response Centers coordinates the multidisciplinary SART for Durham County. The team, comprising DCRC, law enforcement, SANEs, prosecutors and other agencies meet bimonthly to ensure that the community response to sex ual violence is victim -centered, appropriate, coordinated, and informed. In addition, the SART partners with other groups and agencies to increase awareness and promote prevention of sexual assault in the community.

CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 248 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 9.04 Homicide Overview According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2015 over 17,000 people were killed as a result of homicide in the United States. Firearms accounted for 73% of those deaths. The average cost per homicide in the U.S. is $1.5 million in lost productivity and $10,944 in medical costs.i In 201 5, there were 5 93 homicides in North Carolina; 438 (81 %) were caused by firearms.i From 20 11 to 20 15 in Durham County, homicide was the leading cause of death among 20-39 year -olds. Homicide was also the second leading cause of death among 0 -19 year - olds.ii In addition to the immeasurable physical, emotional and psychological impact endured by the survivors and perpetrators' families, loved ones and neighborhoods; there are far reaching community consequences such as community fear and disengagement. Homicide can also cause a strain on local resources and personnel. In 2005, the Durham County EMS system responded to an average of 14 gunshot wounds each month.iii In North Carolina, reported fatal and nonfatal injuries due to firearms resulted in 3,908 visits to the emergency department in 2016 .iv Nationwide, the majority of homicides are committed with a firearm, most often a handgun. Likewise , in Durham County approximately 77% of homicides were committed with a firearm between 2005 and 201 4. Suspicion of intoxication was reported in 20% of homicides and in most incidences the victims knew the assailant.v Primary Data Durham County Community Health Assessment Surveyvi The 201 6 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey randomly selected Durham County households. One section of the survey asked respondents to look at several lists and rank their top three neighborhood concerns. One question had a list of community issues. Respondents were asked, \"Keeping in mind yourself and the people in your neighborhood, tell me the community issues that have the greatest effect on quality of life in Durham County. Please choose up to 3.\" Overall, t he sixth most popular response was \" gangs \" (19%) while \"violent crime\" was selected by 18% of res idents. Violent crime was the most frequent response within the Hi spanic and Latino sample (30%).vi When residents were asked to choose the primary causes of stress that they experience, 10% of residents chose \"violence\". Violence was the sixth leading cause of stress in Durham County. Finally, residents were asked, \"What one thing would make Durham County or your neighborhood a better place to live? (Open ended response)\" and responses were grouped into themes. T he most common response was the reduction of crime and violence (19%).vi CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 249 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Gun Crime and Gun Arrests in Durham Gun arrests have dropped approximately 36% from 2010 to 2015. After the end of the Bull's Eye Initiative, ther e was a 23% drop in gun arrests. During this time frame, almost 30% of the arrests involved youth and young adults between the ages of 16 and 25 who were already convicted felons. The m ost frequent gun charge is carrying a concealed weapon illegally , follo wed by possession of a stolen firearm and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. There has been over a 125% increase in the number of Durham County residents that applied for or renewed a concealed carry permit between 2010 and 2015.vii Seco ndary Data The North Carolina Violent Death Reporting System (NC -VDRS) collects detailed information on deaths that result from violence, such as homicide, suicide, undetermined intent and unintentional firearm deaths . From 200 5 to 20 14, there were 543 violent deaths from injuries sustained in Durham County. Homicides and suicides comprised the vast majority of the violent deaths. There were 281 homicides ( 52%) and 236 suicides ( 44%).v This is in contrast to national data whereby suicides outnumber homicides. From 200 5 to 2014 , there has been an average of 28 homicides per year in Durham County. The trend line in Figure 9.0 4(a) illustrates that homicides have slightly decreased over this sam e time period. In 20 14, there were 2 6 homicides. Nevertheless, similar to the U.S., homicide was the leading cause of death among 20 -39 year -olds and the second leading cause of death among 0 -19 year -olds in Durham County (20 11-2015).ii Number -2014 County, 2005 -2014viii Figure 9.0 4(b) illustrates the identified and reported circumstances that contributed to homicides in Durham County between 200 5 and 2014 . The most commonly known reported circumstances in which homicides occurred in Durham County included: arguments/conflicts 2530 26 010203040 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014NumberCHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 250 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment by another crime such as robbery or burglary ( 38%), drug involvement (20%) and intimate partner violence (1 3%).viii Circumstances o f Homicides, Durham County, 2005 -2014 Figure 9.0 4(b) Circumstances of Homicides, Durham County, 2005 -2014viii Among North Carolinas most populous counties, Durham ranks second in homicide rate with 10.3 homicides per 100,000 residents, as illustrated in Figure 9.0 4(c). This is above the North Carolina rate of 5.4 per 100,000. Durham's rate is higher than the Healthy People 2020 goal of 6.7 per 100,000 individuals.viii Homicide Rate among North Carolina's Most Populous Counties, 2010 -2014 Figure 9.0 4(c) Homicide Rate Among 12.0UnionWakeBuncombeForsythGastonNew HanoverNorth CarolinaGuilfordMecklenburgDurhamCumberland Rate per 100,000 populationCHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 251 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Specific groups of individuals are at greater risk of being homicide victims. In general, males, young people ages 24 -34 and African -Americans are disproportionately impacted. However, evidence demonstrates that race is often a marker of other social determinants related to homicide such as poverty, unemployment, poor education and discrimination. North Carolina: Of all racial and eth nic groups in North Carolina, African -American s and American Indians are at greatest risk of homicide with rates of 15.4 and 13.8 deaths per 100,000 respectively, versus 2.9 deaths per 100,000 for whites in 2015.viii Durham County: In Durham County during 2015, there were 46 homicides; 76% of the homicides were among males. Most victims were African -American (70%) followed by whites (28%) and other (2%). The most common age group is 25 -34 years, followed by those age 45 and older (22%) and 20 -24 years ol d (20%). Firearms were the most common weapon, used in 78% of homicides. Most homicides occurred in a house or apartment (33%), rather than in the street or alley (26%) or motor vehicle (26%).v Emerging Issues It has been consistently demonstrated that the proportion of safely stored firearms increases when a health care provider informs patients and their parents of the risks of having an unlocked gun in the home.ix Firearm safety counseling and safe household firearm storage should be encouraged particularly when there is a family member with mental illness, including depression. Firearms used in the majority of suicides and school shootings were obtained from the households of the shooter or the home of a fam ily member or friend. Recent gun legislation, House Bill 937 , allows for more guns to be legally present at community venues such as park s, restaurants and sporting events. Previous to this legislation, guns were prohibited at these venues. Another more prominent and emerging issue, particularly in communities of color nationwide is police shootings. Stand your ground laws that per mit the use of deadly force without a duty to retreat in any place a person believes they have a lawful right to be if they believe that deadly force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to themselves or another is another emerging issue. Current Initiatives & Activities Durham County Gun Safety Team Supported by the Durham County Department of Public Health and community volunteers. The mission is to reduce death and injury related to firearms through education and outreach and the promotion of a safe and violence free environment for our children. Free gunlocks are distributed as well as education on asking adults about the presence of firearms in places where CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 252 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment your child plays and visits. http://dcopublichealth.org/services/health -education/health - promotion -and-wellness/gun -safety -program North Violen ce (NCGV) The mission of NCGV is t o make North Carolina safe from gun violence through the education of the public about preventing gun violence, the enforcement of current gun laws, and the enactment of needed new laws. www.ncgv.org Religious Coalition for a Non -Violent Durham The Religious Coalition for a Nonviolent Durham (RCND) is a 501c3 nonprofit organization comprised of individuals who as an expression of their faith and goodwill actively seek an end to the violence that is plaguing Durham neighbo rhoods.

Accessed March CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 254 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 9.0 5 Human trafficking Overview Human trafficking is the commercial exploitation of an individual for sex or labor by means of force, fraud, or coercion. Trafficking is occurring across North Carolina, in rural areas and cities , including Durham . While common stereotypes focus on poverty -stricken young girls from foreign countries, victims include women and men, U .S.-born and foreign- born, all races, and every socio - economic status. Some victims are moved from one country or city to another, but many individuals are exploited within their own communities. Sex and labor trafficking occurs in a wide range of settings and workplaces, including hotels, massage parlors, farms, restaurants, nail salons, and door -to-door sales . i Traffickers include pimps , family members, intimate partners, gang members, and international organized crime syndicates .ii According to t he Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000 : 1) Sex trafficking is the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining o f a person for the purpose of a commercial sex act in which the commercial sex act is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the victim induced to perform such an act is less than 18 years of age. 2) Labor trafficking is the recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, or obtaining of a person for labor or services, through the use of force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of subjection to involuntary servitude, peonage, debt bondage or slaver y. iii North Carolina has amended state laws to reflect this language. P assed in October 2013 , Senate Bill 683, or the \"Safe Harbor Bill ,\" reinforces that individuals under age 18 induced to perform a commercial sex act in exchange for anything of value cann ot be charged with prostitution or other related solicitation charges .iv The law assures that minors, who are often engaging in \"survival sex\" in exchange for food or a place to sleep, are considered victims of trafficking and not criminals. In addition, SB 683 broaden s the definition of \"trafficker\" to include complicit business owners and remove s the ability of buyers to claim lack of knowledge of the victim's age as a defense. Victims have a wide range of characteristics but generally exhibit some form o f vulnerability, ranging from low self -esteem to homelessness to immigration status. Many victims have experienced childhood sexual abuse prior to being trafficked . v Many victims interact with service systems such as healthcare, education, or child welfare while they are being trafficked but are not identified and therefore continue to be victimized .vi,vii Human trafficking is an estimated $150 billion worldwide industry , second only to drug trafficking as the largest illicit industry in the world . viii In the U .S., human trafficking is a leading source of income for gangs and organized crime. CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 255 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Impact on Health Victims of human trafficking face acute and chronic health risks - both mental and physical - including drugs and alcohol addiction, physical injuries (broken bones, concussions, burns, vaginal/anal tearing), traumatic brain injury, sexually transmitted infections (e.g. HIV/AIDS, gonorrhea, syphilis), sterility, and forced or coerced abortions . ix Labor trafficking may cause injuries related to unsafe work ing conditions, exposure to pesticides, absence of preventive care, or untreated health conditions .x As in all trauma, exploitation has an extensive, profound negative impact on health in the long -term, both mental and physical. Many victims have undergone traumatic events such as past physical or sexual abuse and neglect prior to being trafficked and may have pre -existing behavioral and mental health disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder or general anxiety disorder .xi Extensive, complex trauma incr eases a survivor's vulnerability to repeated victimization and chronic disease. Secondary Data Identifying victims and perpetrators of human t rafficking presents significant challenges for researchers, law enforcement, and service providers. Fear, shame, isolation, and lack of identification as a victim contributes to individuals not coming forward to seek help . xii Traffickers are skilled at keeping the ir actions hidden and manipulating their victims into silence. In 2016, the National Human Traffick ing Hotline received 598 calls about trafficking in North Carolina leading to 182 identified cases .xiii Currently, the Durham Police Department does not formally track cases of trafficking. Wake County Salvation Army's Project FIGHT has been the primary provi der of services to survivors identified in the Triangle, including Durham. They responded to 7 referrals from Durham in 2014, 12 referrals in 2015, and 5 in 2016.xiv Primary Data No primary data are available. Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues In both sex and labor trafficking, traffickers lure victims into exploitative situations through promises of a better life, employment, or intimate relationships and then alter the situation so that those i ndividuals fall victim to forced, coerced , or fraudulent servitude. Many victims of human trafficking within the United States ar e runaways, homeless or housing -insecure youth, abandoned young people, people of color, and/or those affiliated with the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Qu QI youth , as many as 67% report being forced out of their homes due to their gender identity or se xual orientation . xv These youth show a significantly higher rate of vulnerability towards becoming victims of human trafficking . CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 256 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Children are highly desired in both sex and labor trafficking and are often exploited in the commercial sex trades , performing the same jobs as adults in prostitution, pornography, and sex tourism. Under labor traffi cking, children are regularly found in domestic service, migrant farm work, hotel or restaurant work, door -to-door sales teams, and sweat shops. Signs of Trafficking It can be difficult to identify the signs of human trafficking, as no one indicator guarantees trafficking is occurring . Trafficked individuals rarely view themselves as victims and are rarely in a position to seek help. S everal commonalities may help iden tify a trafficking situation. R ed flags include situational indicators and physical indicators: History of involvement with Child Protective Services, Social Services, and/or foster care Truancy or drops out of school completely Early sexual initiation Habitual runaway Homeless or housing -insecure Controlling behavior of romantic partner or another individual including family members Non-English speaking individual with boyfriend or guardian answering all questions History of arrests for drug offenses, theft, or prostitution Lack of identifying documents Sudden changes in appearance and/or health (nails, hair, teeth, clothing, tattoos) Multiple pregnancies or abortions In possession of large amounts of cash or multiple cellphones Tired during the day fro m working at night Repeated visits to emergency room or urgent care clinics Lingering outside one particular business or hotel Bodyguards around a home, factory, or business Vehicles and people coming and going from a particular establishment at odd hours If three or more of the above signs are identified in one particular spot or with one individual, this should be seen as a red flag and cause witnesses to look further into the situation . xvi Recommended Strategies While human trafficking is a specific violent crime, it overlaps with several existing violations, such as sexual assault, domestic violence, child pornography, labor exploitation, and various juvenile crimes. All direct service providers who work within these areas (such as law enforcement officers, social workers, justice system personnel, and nonprofit workers whose organizations work to end the injustices listed above) should screen for signs of force, fraud, or coercion when meeting with clients and be mind ful of potential indicators of human trafficking. CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 257 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment In addition to direct service providers, anyone may encounter a victim of trafficking simply as a community member living and working around others. Below is a list of individuals who are most likely to interact with someone who has been a victim of traffi cking: Health care providers , e.g., paramedics, doctors, nurses, emergency room personnel, medical clinic personnel, community lay health advisors, crisis pregnancy center personnel, urgent care personnel, etc. Human service workers , e.g., social workers, rape crisis advocates, health department workers, department of social service workers, Child Protective Services personnel, diversion program personnel, etc. Law enforcement , e.g., local police departments, state highway patrol, sheriff departments, FBI, State Bureau of Investigation, undercover officers, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, airport police officers, etc. Education staff , e.g., teachers, social workers, counselors, principals, School Resource Officers, janitorial staff, class or room pare nts, aides, etc. Members of religious communities , e.g., pastors, monks, rabbis, imams, priests, deacons, elders, childcare workers, group leaders, etc. Attorneys , e.g., Public Defenders, District Attorneys, divorce lawyers, employment lawyers, immigratio n law yers, Legal Aid attorneys, etc. Employees of travel and transportation businesses , e.g., hotel clerks, hotel custodial staff, gas station attendants, taxi cab drivers, airplane pilots and stewards/stewardesses, train conductors and support staff, etc. Recommended strategies to combat human trafficking include increasing recognition and response in Durham by partnering with professionals to conduct on -going trainings for staff and volunteers in various sectors and venues across the county. In additio n, it is recommended that agencies collaborate to create a wrap -around model of high - quality services for victims of human trafficking . Few options are currently available to the Durham community. The U.S. Department of State's Trafficking in Person's Report for 2017 emphasizes the importance of view ing human trafficking as a public health concern as well. Untreated conditions, especially contagious illnesses such as those contracted while a person is being trafficked, can threaten the health of the indiv idual victims, as well as the collective health condition of their communities. xvii Per 2015's House Bill 279, it is recommended that staff in schools utilize resources from community agencies and incorporate education and prevention strategies in their regular instruction with middle and high school students. Schools should also implement a response system for students who may self -identify or identify a friend who may be a victim of human trafficking. CHAPTER 9 Injury and Violence 258 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment It is also recommended that parents learn to commun icate in an age- appropriate manner with children as young as preschool age on issues such as boundaries, consent, healthy interactions with others, and healthy versus unhealthy sexual interactions with others. If trafficking is suspected anywhere, indivi duals should call the Polaris National Human Trafficking Hotline number at 888 -373-7888 and report what was witnessed . Calls can be made anonymously. These tips lead local and trained professionals to investigate the alleged trafficking and assess the prop er response needed.

CHAPTER 10 Oral Health 260 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Oral Health An individual's oral health plays a n important role in their overall health. Studies have shown direct links between oral infections and other conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and poor pregnancy outcomes. Dental caries are the most common chronic infectious disease among children; if untreated, dental caries can result in problems with speaking, playing, learning, and receiving proper nutrition. In addition, untreated oral health problems in children and adults can cause severe pain and suffering. Those who delay care often have higher treatment costs when they finally receive it. Despite major improvements in oral health for the overall population, oral health disparities exist. Oral health disparities are profound in the United States because of one or more barriers such as poor access to care, oral health literacy, level of education, age, language barriers, cultural factors, ability to perform daily oral health care, and geography. The economic factors that often relate to poor oral health include lack of access to dental services as well as the lack of an individual's ability to obtain and retain dental insurance. Healthy North Carolina 2020 includes three objectives for oral health. Their rationale for inclusion is:i Children of low-income families are more likely to have tooth decay. One reason is that many children with public coverage lack access to dental care. On average, fewer than half of all North Carolinians aged one to five years enrolled in Medicaid receive any dental care in a year. Dental decay in children can be measured by the number of teeth affected by decay, the number of teeth that have been extracted, or the number of teeth successfully filled. The prevalence of decayed, missing, or filled teeth in young children is higher in low-income populations and in rural communities without fluoridated water. Untreated tooth decay and gum disease can lead to permanent tooth loss among adults. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nationally, one in three adults has untreated tooth decay, and one in seven adults ha ve gum disease. This chapter includes: Section 10.01 Oral Health of Children Section 10.02 Adult Oral Health CHAPTER 10 Oral Health 261 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 10.01 Oral health in children Overview Dental caries, the disease process that causes tooth decay, is the most prevalent childhood disease and according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention affects more than 25% of U .S. children aged two to five and half of those aged 12 to 15.ii Dental decay is five times more prevalent than asthma and seven times more prevalent than hay fever.iii Fortunately, most oral diseases can be prevented . Instilling proper oral habits in children at an early age that will be continued throughout life is the best way to ensure a child does not get cavities .iv Good personal care, such as brushing with fluoride toothpaste, daily flossing, drinking optimally fluoridated water, maintaining a healthy diet, and regular professional treatment is critical for good oral health. Healthy NC 2020 Objectives Public health and prevention experts identified two measures for objective s in the oral health for children focus area that are listed in Table 10.01(a). Table 10.01(a) Healthy NC 2020 Oral Health Objectives Healthy NC 2020 Objectivev Current Durham Current NC 2020 Target 1. Increase the percentage of children ages 1 -5 years enrolled in Medicaid who received any dental service during the previous 12 months . 58.8% (2015)vi 41.7% (2015)vii 56.4% 2. Decrease the average number of decayed, missing, or filled teeth among kindergarteners. 1.75 (2015-16)viii 1.58 (2015- 16)ix 1.1 In the spring of 2013, the NC Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, Oral Health Section reported that North Carolina ha d already surpass ed the Healthy People 2020 goal . Dental screening in Durham Public Elementary Schools shows that Durham County has also surpassed the Healthy People 2020 goal of 25.9% untreated decay .x,xi The health of primary teeth is important to the health of permanent teeth because primary teeth act as space savers for permanent teeth. Healthy primary teeth also reduce the risk for caries in permanent teeth. Secondary Data According to data from North Carolina Department of Heal th and Hum an Services, t he percentage of children in Durham County ages 1-5 years enrolled in Medicaid who received dental service s in Durham County has slightly decreased over the past five years , from 60.4% in 2010 to 58.8% CHAPTER 10 Oral Health 262 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment in 201 5. A more s ubstantial decrease was seen at the state level during this time frame, with a drop from 51.7% to 41.7%.xii,xiii Despite the small drop, D urham County is still surpassing the Healthy NC 2020 objective for this measure, which was set at 56.4% as shown in Table 10.01(b ) below. Table 10.01( b): Percentage of Children Ages 1 to 5 Years Enrolled in Medicaid Who Received Dental Servicesxiv,xv 2010 2015 Healthy NC 2020 Target 56.4% 56.4% 51.7% 41.7% Durha m 60.4% 58.8% Table 10.01(c) below highlights the high proportion of children enrolled in Medicaid in Durham County who received an oral evaluation during 2015 .. In Durham, 94.7% of children aged 3 -5 received an oral evaluation compared to 64.3% statewide. Percentages among children 0 -2 yea rs old were substantially less at 31.3% and 22.5%, respectively. On average, oral evaluations in Region 5 were utilized less than in Durham County and North Carolina. Table 10.01(c).

Though there was a substantial decrease in the percentage of kindergarteners who were observed to have decayed teeth in Durham Public Schools after the 2007 -2008 school year, the percentage since then has slowly increased from 11% during 2008 -2009 to 13% d uring 2015 -2016. Data for the 2010 -2011 and 2014 -2015 school years are missing. The trend over time is displayed below in Figure 10.01(a). CHAPTER 10 Oral Health 263 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Figure 10.01( a): Percent Kindergarten Children Observed to have Decayed Teeth in Durham Public Schoolsxvii,xviii Interpretations: Disparities, gaps, emerging issues Compared to Non -Hispanic Whites, African -Americans living in North Carolina were significantly more likely to report having a permanent tooth removed because of tooth decay or gum disease. During 2016, 45.5% or non -Hispanic Whites reported having a permanent tooth removed compared to 58.6% of African -Americans.xix County level statistics were unavailable for this measure. Table 10.1 (d) below highlights the number of children enrolled in Medicaid who recei ved dental services in North Carolina, Region 5, and Durham County during 2014 and 2015. The Government Accountability Office found that despite the increase in dental services among Medicaid enrolled low income children, they still visit the dentist less often than privately insured children due to access barriers that continue to exist.xx Table 10.01 (d) Number of Medicaid Claims Paid for Children Receiving Dental Treatmentxxi 2014 2015 Age Procedure State Region 5 Durham State These statistics represent 264 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Recommended Strategies The increase in the number of children ages one to five years accessing dental preventive services should decrease the number of children observed in Durham County Public Schools with decayed, missing, and filled teeth . This would increase the chance of Durham County reaching , if not surpassing , the Healthy NC 2020 objectives . Programs in Durham County such as the \"baby Oral Health programs (bOHP)xxii\" as well as \"Into the Mouth of Babes (IMB)\"xxiiiin medical and dental clinics [Table 10.1(d) ] have been shown to be effective in improving access to preventive dental services for children one to five years of age and reducing childhood tooth decay in children .xxiv,xxv In addition to providing training for staff in medical offices , these progra ms provide training for parents and daycare staff . The training emphasize s the importance of provid ing good oral hygiene and good nutrition from their first tooth for children up to five years old . Examples of evidenced -based and promising practices shown to yield a reduction in decay are: Community water fluoridation, oral health school surveillance programs , and dental homes established for chil dren found to have dental needs. Preventive measures and education have also been found to yield significa nt savings .xxvi,xxvii Current Initiatives & Activities Durham County Department of Public Health Dental Clinic The Durham County Department of Public Health Dental Clinic provides low cost dental care for children 6 months through 20 years of age and also pregnant women from third month through their sixth month of pregnancy. http://dcopublichealth.org/services/dental -clinic -3674 \"baby Oral Health Program (bOHP)\" bOHP is a program designed to educate dental health care providers on the principles of infant and toddler oral health to equip them with the necessary tools to be comfortable and competent at providing oral health services for young children . http://www.babyoralhealthprogram.org/ CHAPTER 10 Oral Health 265 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment References i North Carolina Institute of Medicine.

CHAPTER 10 Oral Health 267 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 10.02 Adult oral health Overview For adults, o ral health includes preventing or treating dental caries (tooth decay ) and tooth loss, periodontal ( gum) disease s, dry mouth, and oral infections, sores and cancers. Poor oral health may affect a person's ability to eat, speak, and smile, impacting one's overall physical health and mental well -being. Healthy People 2020 recommends brushing with fluoride toothpaste, daily flossing and professional treatment, and avoiding tobacco use, excessive alcohol consumption and poor diet, for good oral health.i Healthy People 2020 goals for adult oral health include: Reduce the pro portion of adults with untreated dental decay Reduce the proportion of adults who have ever had a permanent tooth extracted because of dental caries or periodontal disease Reduce the proportion of adults aged 45 to 74 years with moderate or severe periodon titis Increase the proportion of oral and pharyngeal cancers detected at the earliest stage Increase the proportion of adults who used the oral health care system in the past year Increase the proportion of patients who receive oral health services at Fede rally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) each year Increase the proportion of adults who receive preventive interventions in dental offices (information on reducing tobacco use or on smoking cessation, oral and pharyngeal cancer screening, and/or tests or referrals for glycemic control)ii Secondary Data Prior Community Health Assessments included oral health data specific to Durham County collected through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). In 2016, North Carolina was only able to rep ort BRFSS data by regions rather than county and grouped Durham with Caswell, Chatham, Person, Randolph, Rockingham, Alamance, Orange and Guilford Counties . This change makes it difficult to compare Durham 's performance on these key indicators over the years. The Oral Health Section of the N.C. Division of Public Health released a North Carolina Oral Health Surveillance Plan 2016 -2020, which in the future will provide new sources of data on access to oral health care, oral health outcomes, community interventions and infrastructure.iii With the exception of Orange County (where UNC School of Dentistry is located), Durham County has more dentists than the other count ies in the region (ratio of 1,390 residents : 1 dentist ) and is close to the top performing counties in the U .S. (ratio of 1,320 residents : 1 dentist ).iv The ratio of dentists to residents in Durham County and peer counties in North Carolina is highlighted in Table 10.02(a) below. It is important to note that the a large quantity of providers does not always equate to greater access, as factors like transportation, health insurance, and economic factors also affect access to care. CHAPTER 10 Oral Health 268 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Table 10.02(a). Ratio of Dentist to Residentsv Geographic Location Ratio Top US Performers Randolph 1:3,480 Rockingham 1:3,060 Though county level data are no longer available through the BRFSS, state and regional level indicators continue to be collected every two years. Figure 10.02(a) below depicts the length of time since residents' last dental exam . The majority of residents in North Carolina an d Region 5 reported being seen by a dentist in the past year (63.6% and 61.0%, respectively). The percentage of residents who reported being seen between 1 -5 years ago were similar, ranging from approximately 11 -15%. On average, residents in North Carolina and Region 5 reported similar behavior in terms of frequency of dental visits during 2016. Length of Time since Last Dental Exam, North Carolina and Region 5 , 2016 Figure 10.02(a). Length of Time since Last Dental Exam, North Carolina and Region 5 , 2016vi State and regional level data on the number of teeth removed due to decay , displayed below in Figure 10.02(b), are similar across each domain. The figure below shows that the majority of residents in North Carolina and in Region 5 have not had a tooth removed due to decay. To be specific, 52.4% of residents in North Carolina surveyed and 56.2% of residents in Region 5 reported not having any teeth removed due to decay when surveyed in 2016. Over a quarter of residents in North Carolina and in Region 5 h ave had between 1 and 5 teeth removed during their lifetime due or more years NeverPercnet of Population NC Region 5CHAPTER 10 Oral Health 269 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Similarly, figure 10.02(c) shows the percent of adults over 65 years old who have had all teeth extracted in North Carolina and Region 5 during 2016. In Region 5, 16.1% of survey re spondents indicated that they had all teeth removed and in North Carolina, 18.1% of survey respondents reported having all their teeth extracted.viii These data are similar to trends seen regionally and nationally.ix Number of Teeth Removed Due to Decay, Nor th Carolina and Region 5 , 2016 Figure 10.02(b). Number of Teeth Removed Due to Decay, North Carolina and Region 5 , 2016x Percent of Adults 65 and Older with All Teeth Extracted, North Carolina and Region 5 , 2016 Figure 10.02(c). Percent of Adults 65 and Older with All Teeth Extracted, North Carolina and Region 5 , 2016xi The 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey asked respondents whether they had a problem getting the health care they needed for themselves or f or someone in their household. Among the respondents from the full County sample (30) who answered they had a problem getting the health care they needed for themselves or for someone in their household, 53% listed dental care as the type of health care (h igher than other types of health care). Among the respondents from the Hispanic and Latino sample who stated they had a problem getting the healthcare they needed for themselves or someone in their household (33), 42% listed dental care as a need ( second only to primary care). xii The American Dental Association Health Policy Institute reports that 15% of low income adults in North Carolina say their mouth or teeth are in poor condition and report problems such as pain, avoiding smiling, and reducing partic ipation in social activities. Seventy -four percent of low income adults, compared to 45% of high income adults , report that they \"accept I will lose some 29.2% 12.3%6.1%52.4% 27.7% 11.0%5.1%56.2% 1 to 5 6 or more but not all All NonePercent of Population NC Region 5 18.1%81.9% 16.1%83.9% Yes NoPercent NC Region 5CHAPTER 10 Oral Health 270 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment teeth with age.\" Cost was by far the biggest reason given among those who have not visited a dentist in the past year.xiii Seco ndary Data Satomi Imai and Christopher Mansfield , researchers at the Department of Public Health Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, analyzed the N .C. BRFSS data to better understand the relationship between oral health and general health and quality of life. They found that adults who had lost six or more teeth (especially those less than 65 years old) were more likely to say their health was fair or poor. Education, income, race, and ethnicity have a large impact on access to dental care and overall health . Persons with less education and income, and those who smoke or have diabetes, are more likely to have lost six or more teeth.xiv Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues The NC Oral Health Collaborative issued a \"Portrait of Oral Health in North Carolina.\" In his perspective, R. Gary Rozier, DDS, notes that while significant progress has been made in the last 50 years to reduce tooth l oss, dental disease remains a significant burde n among lower -income persons. He proposes three strategies to address the social determinants of oral health : 1. Address access barriers through innovative solutions such as integration of oral health services into medical care and social service programs . 2. Improve the interactions with dental care patients, especially those with low literacy or language barriers, to create more patient -centered care . 3. Implement policies to reduce inequalities, such as oral health services in long term care and prev ention and early intervention.xv In North Carolina, adults with most forms of Medicaid are covered for dental services, including exams, cleanings, filling s, sealants, x -rays, extractions, partial dentures or compl ete dentures. Adults who sign up for subsidized health insurance through the federal insurance marketplace may also purchase separate dental health insurance plans. The dental insurance plans through the federal marketplace are similar in cost and design to those available to any consumer - including high out -of-pocket expenses, wait times for certain procedures, and limited annual benefits. Medicare does not cover dental services although dental coverage can be added on most Medicare Advantage Plan . Thi s leaves many older adults, especially those in assisted living and long term care facilities, to experience oral diseases. Fortunately , Durham County does have a Department of Public Health which provides dental care for youth until age 21 and pregnant women . Linco ln Community Health Center, a Federally Qualified Health Center , provides dental care for all ages. Durham County also has two free clinics at Samaritan Health Center and Student National Dental Association ( SNDA ) CAARE Dental Clinic. Noneth eless, these clinics annually are only able to serve about 4,000 adults. The UNC School of Dentistry is close enough in Chapel Hill that many Durham County residents travel there for dental services at reduced rates. Although the cost for dental services at UNC School of CHAPTER 10 Oral Health 271 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Dentistry is reduced , the amount of fees for most of their services and transportation issues are barriers for many uninsured/low income patients . Recommended Strategies The Oral Health Workgroup of the Partnership for a Healthy Durham Access to Care committee recommends these strategies to improve the oral health of Durham County residents and reduce disparities over the next three years : 1. Create Oral Health Champion s to identify and develop best practices in oral health and represent o ral health concerns in other health and community contexts. 2. Identify and support funding opportunities to expand capacity at existing safety net dental clinics, including Department of Public Health, Lincoln Community Health Center, Samaritan Health Center , and SNDA CAARE Dental Clinic . 3. Identify and support opportunities to expa nd the safety net through donated dental care provided by dentists in private practice. 4. Develop oral health program for patients with diabetes and/or heart disease receiving primary care at Lincoln Community Health Center , and evaluate outcomes. 5. Develop educational materials regarding dental insurance for D epartment of Social Services (DSS) workers, Certified Application Counselors, and Navigators to use with persons signing up for Me dicaid or health insurance through the federal marketplace. 6. Support the efforts of the NC Oral Health Collaborative.

CHAPTER 11 Environmental Health 273 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Environmental Health This chapter includes: Air Quality Water Quality Lead Poisoning CHAPTER 11 Environmental Health 274 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 11.01 Air quality Overview Healthy air is essential to public health. Air pollution is responsible for 200,000 premature deaths per year in the United States .i The main causes of death linked to air pollution are heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung disease .ii [See Chapter 6 for information on heart and respiratory diseases in Durham.] There are many sources of air pollution, including fossil fuel energy generation, transportation, industrial manufacturing, and open burning of yard waste .iii Legislation and regulations regarding air pollution have been enacted at both federal and state levels to protect the environment and public health, such as the Clean Air Act. While there are many types of air pollutants, particulate matter (PM 2.5, 2.5 m icrons in diameter or smaller) and ozone are of the most concern to public health .ii Both of these pollutants are invisible and can be inhaled. PM 2.5 can be composed of solid or liquid particles. In addition, PM is heterogeneous, meaning that it is compris ed of many different substances. A typical fine particle can include hazardous heavy metals, air toxics, and various types of carbon. PM 2.5 can reach deep in the lungs, causing inflammation, oxidative stress and imbalance of the autonomic nervous system .iv Ground level ozone is the same chemical that blocks the sun's rays higher in the atmosphere. Higher level ozone is a good thing, but ground level ozone can harm individuals' lungs and heart s. The allowable concentrations of PM 2.5 and ozone in our air are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Air pollution will also be exacerbated by climate change, which causes many health issues aside from those related to air quality. Climate change is a global problem that occurs when too many heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are released into the atmosphere. These gases, called \"greenhouse gases\" (GHG's), are naturally occurring in the atmosphere, but are also released through hum an activities like burning fossil fuels and raising livestock .v Energy from the sun enters the atmosphere and gets trapped by these gases resulting in changing air and ocean currents, more extreme weather events, melting glaciers and ice caps, and changing habitats. Public health in Durham could be affected in two ways. First, health problems that are normally related to climate or weather could be worsened with changed severity or frequency of extreme weather conditions. These include heat stress, stroke s, asthma, allergies, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, and infectious diseases such as Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever .vi Second, Durham residents could experience health problems that have traditionally not been a problem here, such as tropical diseases like Zika and Chikungunya .vii CHAPTER 11 Environmental Health 275 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Primary Data Outdoor Air Quality High -quality PM 2.5 measurements have been collected across the US since 2000. The annual PM 2.5 concentrations in Durham, as well as other NC counties, has been steadily decreasing over time (Fig. 11.01(a) ). PM 2.5 concentrations in Durham County are very similar to other counties in the state. Durham County is currently well below the annual federal and state PM 2.5 standard of 12 \u00b5g/m3, indicating that with regards to PM 2.5, air quality in Durham County has been consistently improving over time and is generally good . The average concentrations of other states in the U .S. is not shown due to problems accessing the data. Annual PM 2.5 Average , North Carolina Counties, 2000 -2016 Figure 11.01(a). Annual PM 2.5 Average, North Carolina Counties, 2000 -2016viii Ozone measurements have also been collected since 2000 in NC . Ozone levels are low in the winter and high in the summer due to various atmospheric and meteorological reasons. As such, most areas in the U.S. only reach hazardous ozon e concentrations in the summer and r egulations only require that ozone be measured dur ing this high ozone season . Although the annual ozone concentrations in Durham County are slightly lower than the average of other North Carolina counties, the ozone concentrations for Durham County shown above are overestimated (Figure 11.01(b) ). This overestimation is due to other counties in N.C. collecting ozone concentrat ions throughout the entire year, whereas Durham only collects ozone measurements between April and November, as required by the EPA . Like PM 2.5, ozone levels are also signific antly below the ozone standard of around 0.07 parts per million (ppm) (although the standard has a different form than a simple annual average), which further supports the idea that Durham has generally good air quality. Unlike PM 2.5, which has been decrea sing over time, ozone levels have remained fairly constant over the past 18 years.

Days with Maximum Temperature above 95oF, Durham County, 1950 -2035x As shown above in Figure 11.01(c), t he number of days with a maximum temperature above 95oF is expected to increase under scenarios that include both reducing greenhouse gas emissions (blue) CHAPTER 11 Environmental Health 277 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment and regular emissions (red) .x More days with high maximum temperatures could lead to increased incidences of heat related problems such as heat stroke, heart attacks ,xi and asthma .xii Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Air pollution is not evenly distributed across the country, or even within the state. Affected by factors such as weather patterns, air pollution often impacts areas and communities that are not directly causing the pollution. Certain populations - such as children, older adults, people with lung disea ses, such as asthma, or heart disease, and those who are active outdoors - are more vulnerable, and therefore, at greater risk from ground -level ozone, particulate pollution, and other pollutants .xiii Research has shown that facilities which report to the Environmental Protection Agency's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) are more concentrated in communities of color and that these communities are also more likely to be characterized by low median income, low homeownership, and are more linguistically isolated .xiv Recommended Strategies 1) Trees provide many environmental and social benefits including removing pollution from air and water, creating shade, and reducing stress. The City of Durham currently has a 52% urban canopy , but that is expected to change in the next decade as larger, older trees die and more forest land is developed. Durham should increase activities to plant and maintain tree coverage throughout the urban areas of the county. xv 2) Air quality education is es sential to improving public health and our community. To reach more Durham residents, Durham should implement the Air Quality Flag Program at all public schools and county facilities. The Air Quality Flag Program uses colored flags based on the Air Quality Index (AQI) from the EPA to indicate the outdoor air quality for each day. By making the day's AQI more visible, residents and visitors will be better able to take actions to protect their health. 3) The transportation sector is a large contributor to ai r pollution that local municipalities can address. Durham should invest in and promote transportation choices that have low or no air pollution emissions. This includes expanding public transportation, bike and walking options; encouraging electric vehicle s that do not emit air pollutants locally; and educating private and commercial drivers about the importance of reducing vehicle idling. CHAPTER 11 Environmental Health 278 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment 4) Even though Durham's air quality meets federal standards, research has shown that there are no acceptable levels of ex posure to ozone and fine particulate matter, so the county needs to continue to improve its air quality, regardless of the standards, to ensure it is protecting public health. Current Initiatives & Activities NC Department of Environmental Quality - NC Air Awareness NC Air Awareness is a public outreach and education program of the North Carolina Division of Air Quality. The goal of the program is to reduce air pollution through voluntary actions by individuals and organizations. https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/air -quality/air -quality - outreach/air -quality -public -involvement/air -awareness US Environmental Protection Agency - Air Topics This website provides descriptions of community -based air toxics projects designed to assess and address health and environmental issues at the local level. www.epa.gov/env ironmental - topics/air -topics Clean Air Carolina This non -profit organization works to ensure cleaner air quality for all North Carolinians through education and advocacy and by working with partners to reduce sources of pollution.

Environmental Health 281 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 11.02 Water quality Overview Water is one of the vital natural resour ces upon which all life depends . Clean water is essential for healthy living. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States is fortunate to have one of the safest public drinking water supplies in the world.i The U.S. public drinking water systems are comprised of both community and non -community systems. Community water systems (CWS ), supply water to the same population year -round. These systems include municipalities, subdivisions, mobile park homes and more. Non -community water systems are comprised of both transient and non -transient water systems. Transient non - community water systems (TNCWS) supply water to 25 or more people for at least two months out of the year, but not to the same people and not on a regular basis (for example, gas stations, campgrounds).ii Non-transient non -community water systems (NTNCWS) regularly supply water to at least 25 of the same people at least six mo nths per year, but not year -round (for example, schools, factories, office buildings, and hospitals which have their own water systems).iii The water source for a CWS may be lakes serving as reservoirs or wells constructed to CWS standards. Other Durham residents have their water provided by private wells constructed to private well water standards. These private wells are typically found outside of the city limits. The Little River and Lake Michie reservoirs, both located in northern Durham County, supp ly raw water to The City of Durham's treatment plants for distribution to properties connected to municipal water. As of October 13, 2017 there are 20 active water supply systems in Durham County classified as CWS.iv Seco ndary Data Municipal Drinking Water Durham County has two drinking water reservoirs , Lake Michie and the Little River. Surface waters treated for public water supplies in Durham are stored in these two reservoirs . Two other lakes partially located within Durham County are Jordan and F alls Lakes, which serve as drinking water supplies for municipalities in other North Carolina counties. Lake Michie and the Little River Reservoir have a combined safe yield of 27.9 million gallons per day (MGD) , which is treated in one of two plants.v The Williams Water Treatment Plant at Hillandale Road has a capacity of 22 MGD. The Brown Water Treatment Plant at Infinity Road has a capacity of 30 MGD. These plants treat raw water to meet stringent State and Federal water quality criteria before pumping into Durham's distribution system. The annual daily average water production of the combined facilities was approximately 27.5 MGD for 2016 .vi CHAPTER 11 Environmental Health 282 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Healthy NC 2020 Objective Healthy NC 2020 Objectivevii Durham County North Carolinaviii 2020 Target Increase the percentage of the population being served by community water systems (CWS) with no maximum contaminant level violations (among persons on CWS) to 95%. 90.0% (2016 )ix 93.8% (2011) 95% Quality of Drinking Water The City of Durham produces an annual water quality report for its CWS. This report presents updates on Durham's drinking water and treatment processes. Durham also prepares an annual sewer system report which explains the City's wastewater treatment and c ollection system performance. The City of Durham is required to test for more than 150 different constituents in the drinking water. During 2016, all detected substances were below the water quality levels allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency (E PA) thus achieving 100% compliance.x Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Infrastructure Improvement There are numerous concurrent infrastructure improvements being implemented by the City of Durham. The Brown plant is undergoing improvements to increase production capacity from 30 to 42 MGD.xi The Williams plant is also being improved through remodel of the operations facility and replacement of the reservoir apron.xii,xiii Private Drinking Water Well Sampling Aside from new well construction, private drinking water well sampling is not mandatory as is with community water supplies. Well owners and users may be unaware of potential contaminants within their water supply. The Durham County Department of Public Health provides well water testing services for a fee. Recommended Strategies Continued community outreach and education is advisable for those residents utilizing well water. The Durham County Department of Public Health Environmental Health Division staff regularly educates well owners during the course of normal duties . Staff also participates in commun ity outreach events such as the \"Think Blue\" Durham Community outreach event held August 6, 2017 . CHAPTER 11 Environmental Health 283 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Environmental Health staffed a booth with education displays, materials, handouts, and fielded questions from the community regarding water quality issues.

CHAPTER 11 Environmental Health 285 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 11.03 Lead poisoning Overview Lead poisoning remains a major environmental health concern in the United States. Approximately half a million children, ages 1 -5, have blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter ( g/dL ), the reference level at which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recommend public health actions be initiated .i Lead poisoning is preventable, yet the negative health effects can be life -long if it is not treated early .ii Early detec tion is a tool that is used to identify sources of lead exposure and help families limit exposure, in order to decrease its potential damaging health effects. \"The most important step parents, doctors, and others can take is to prevent lead exposure b efore it occurs .\"iii Lead can affect anyone, but children, ages six and younger are affected more because their body's nervous systems have not yet fully developed .iv Lead interferes with and can impair the development of children's bodies because t heir growing bodies absorb four to five times as much ingested lead as adults from a given source, and their brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead .v,vi Young children are particularly vulnerable to lead hazards present in their surrounding environment. They also expose themselves to the harmful effects of lead by putting their hands and other objects in their mouths .vii Lead poisoning poses particular risks to people of color and low -income children, because they are more likely to live in substandard housing and polluted communities, which increases their risk of exposure .viii Many adults and children don't realize that lead may be present in their homes, in many forms. While le ad-based paint and paint chips inside and around homes are the most common and dangerous source of lead exposure (especially in residential buildings built before 1978), lead has been found in some other sources, including contaminated drinking water, soil , dust, candies, spices, artificial turf grass, toys (including some toy jewelry), consumer products, folk medicine, and in foods (sometimes used as a food additive, or cosmetically for religious reasons ).ix,x,xi Currently, at least four million households have children that are being exposed to high levels of lead.xii There is no known safe blood lead concentration .xiii However, it is known that as lead exposure increases, the range and severity of symptoms and effects also increa se.xiv Lead exposure in young children and pregnant women can cause serious health effects, and \"can affect almost every organ and system in the body \".xv \"Lead can accumulate in the body over time, where it is stored in bones along with calcium. During pregnancy, lead is released from bones as maternal calcium and is used to help form the bones of the fetus \".xvi This risk increases if the pregnant mom is calcium deficient .xvii Lead can also pass from a mother to her unborn child through the placenta .xviii CHAPTER 11 Environmental Health 286 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Even levels of lead in children's blood as low as 5 \u00b5g/dL , once thought to be a \"safe level,\" can contribute to: o Learning problems ( lower IQ, ADHD) o Reduced attention span o Behavioral problems (e.g. Juvenile delinquency/criminal behavior) o Delayed growth o Hearing problems o Anemiaxix In pregnant women, lead exposure can: o Increase risk for miscarriage o Cause a baby to be born too early or too small o Hurt the baby's brain, kidneys and central nervous systemxx Healthy NC 2020 Objective There is currently no Healthy NC 2020 Objective for lead poisoning. Primary Data The data show that since CDC has lowered the action level to 5 \u00b5g/dL, the number of children that have an elevated blood lead level has increased in the children tested at six months and six years old. The positivity rate among children tested, shown in Table 11.03(a) below, shows an upward trend in the proportion of children with high elevated blood levels in Durham County from 2012 to 2016. The number of cases also increased from 2012 to 2016, with a spike in cases and the positivity rate during 2015.xxi Trend in Elevated Blood Lead Levels, Durham County, 2012 -2016 Year Number Tested Confirmed 5-9 Confirmed >10 Total Cases Percent Confirmed among Those Tested 2012 5,204 N/A 6 6 0.1% 2013 5,024 10 4 14 0.3% 2014 4,663 9 2 11 0.2% 2015 4,736 21 6 27 0.6% 2016 4,709 15 3 18 0.4% Table 11.03(a) Children ages 6 months - 6 years in Durham County Tested for Elevated Blood Lead Levels in Durham County , 2012 -2016xxii CHAPTER 11 Environmental Health 287 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, and Emerging Issues A new North Carolina state law, enacted July 1, 2017, lowers the blood lead action level that triggers the requirement to offer an environmental investigation for children under six years old and in pregnant women from 10 g/dL to 5 g/dL .xxiii An environmental investigation is now required for children and pregnant women with confirm ed blood lead levels of 10 g/dL or greater (two blood lead tests within a 12 -month period, starting on July 1, 2016) .xxiv This aligns the North Carolina law with the CDC's 2012 federal guidelines. State implementation is planned to begin on January 1, 2018 .xxv Durham County is currently responding to the mandated lowering of the blood lead action level for children and pregnant women by reviewing the new guidelines issued by the Children's Environmental Health Unit. This change has the potential to greatly affect the County's current caseload. Since the state program is the primary program for the implementation of this new law, Durham County will have to determine what its involvement will be in working with organizations such as Partnership Effort for the Advancement of Children's Health (PEACH ) and Reinvestment Partners, in reviewing the past environmental sampling results of t he residences of children that have been assessed. Recommended Strategies Parents, doctors, and other pro viders should seek blood lead level testing and monitoring for children early in order to prevent lead poisoning and its negative health effects from occurring .xxvi The addition of a designated full -time lead nurse for lead poisoning diagnosis and treatment would be helpful to increase the testing, monitoring, and treatment of Durham County citizens. If there is a substantial number of children and pregna nt women at risk for lead poisoning, it may be in the County's interest to develop and implement its own lead investigation program, so that the County's Department of Public Health can more efficiently and effectively provide this service to its citizens. However, this will involve investment in expensive lead testing equipment. Currently Durham County is providing assistance to the state lead program. If Durham operated its own program, it would share state funding with other counties from the state's anticipated expanded Medicaid funding. This move could allow for additional funding for Durham's lead poisoning services. Durham County could implement its own Healthy Homes Initiative and include lead testing in its investigation of homes for pregnant women and children with asthma , in coordination with the investigation of other asthma triggers, including moisture, rodents, odors, chemical storage, and other indoor air quality concerns. CHAPTER 11 Environmental Health 288 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Current Initiatives & Activities Durham County Department of Public Health (DCoDPH) DCoDPH o ffers free lead poisoning education and onsite testing for children six -months to six years old .

Since the health of the community is seen as the responsibility of the local health authority, it is vital that local public health be prepared to re spond in the event of a disaster. The Public Health Emergency Preparedness program focuses on the capability of local public health to effectively plan for and respond to a wide range of public health threats. The goal is to create a more resilient communi ty by reducing illness or the risk of injuries caused by acts of terrorism, natural disasters, and communicable disease outbreaks. Overview Public Health Emergency Preparedness focuses on the ability of the health department to plan for, respond to and recover from emergencies that pose a risk to the health of the public. This is accomplished through planning, training and exercising with other county partners and at the appropriate time when an emergency occurs, implementing the plan. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) has \"implemented a systematic process to assist state and local health departments with strategic planning by defining a set of public health preparedness capabilities. The resulting body of work, Public Health Preparedness Capabiliti es: National Standards for State and Local Planning , hereafter referred to as public health preparedness capabilities, creates national standards for public health preparedness capability -based planning and will assist state and local planners in identifyi ng gaps in preparedness, determining the specific jurisdictional priorities, and developing plans for building and sustaining capabilities. These standards are designed to accelerate state and local preparedness planning, provide guidance and recommendatio ns for preparedness planning, and, ultimately, assure safer, more resilient, and better prepared communities\".i Primary Data During the 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey, respondents were asked the following questions assessing their level of preparedness: (1) \"Does your family have a basic 3-day emergency supply kit and plan? Emergency kits often include water, non -perishable food, prescriptions, first aid supplies, flashlight and batteries, non -electric can opener, blankets etc.\" , (2) \"What would be your three top sources of information in a major disaster or emergency in Durham County?\" , (3) \"If you couldn't remain in your house, where would you go in a community -wide emergency?\" , and (4) \"What would be the main reason you might not evacuate or leave your home if asked to do so?\" . The following graphs illustrate the findings from these emergency preparedness questions. CHAPTER 12 Public Health Emergency Preparedness 293 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Percent of Families with a Basic 3 -day Emergency Supply Kit and Plan, Durham County, 2016 Full County Sample Hispanic and Latino Neighborhood Sample Figure 12.01(a): Percent of Families with a Basic 3 -day Emergency Supply Kit and Plan, Durham County, 2016ii The percentage of Durham residents who report having an emergency kit and a plan slightly increased in 2016. The full county sample revealed that 54.1% of residents reported having a 3 - day emergency kit and plan, whereas the 37.9% of respondents from the Hispanic and Latino neighborhood sampl e reported having an emergency kit and plan.ii In 2013 , 50.2% of Durham County residents reported having an emergency kit and a plan. Of the 2013 Latino sample, 35 .5% reported having an emergency kit and plan. Similar to the 2010 and the 2013 survey, the vast majority of Durham County residents in the Full County and Hispanic and Latino neighborhood sample s (68. 8% and 60.3%, respectively ) reported television as their primary source of information. The internet was the second highest r ated source of information for both sample groups, at 61.0% and 45.6%, respectively . Text message was the third highest rated response for both the Full County sample (40.5%) and the Hispanic and Latino sample (39.2 %).ii When asked where they would go dur ing a community -wide emergency if they couldn't remain in their homes, the top response for both the Full County sample (47.6 %) and the Hispanic and Latino sample respondents (39.6%) was to stay with relatives/friends. The second highest response for both the Full County sample (19.0%) and the Hispanic and Latino neighborhood sample (34.8%) was an emergency shelter. In 2013 the second sample response ( 12.8%) was \"other\" compared to the 2016 Full County sample \"other\" response (3.0%). The third response was \"don't know\" for the Full County sample (13.2) while the third response for the Hispanic and Latino sample (16.0%) was Church or faith community.ii No 42.9% 60.6%Yes 37.9%Don't know 12 Public Health Emergency Preparedness 294 | 2017 Durham Home during an Emergency , Full County Sample, Durham County, 2016 Figure 12.01(b): Reasons for Not Evacuating the Home during an Emergency, Full County Sample, Durham County, 2016ii Reason for Not Evacuating the Home during an Emergency, Hispanic and Latino Neighborhood Sample, Durham County, 2016 Figure 12.01(b): Reasons for Not Evacuating the Home during an Emergency, Hispanic and L atino Neighborhood Sample , Durham County, 2016ii Data from the question \"what would be the main reason you might not evacuate or leave your home if asked to do so\" is displayed above.

In fact, t he top Full County sample resp onse (24.9%) was \"would leave \" and the top response from the Hispanic and Latino sample response (26.0%) was \"concern about personal or family safety\" . The second highest response to the question from the Full County sample (17.9 %) was concern for their pe ts, while the second highest response for the Hispanic and Latino sample (24.3 %) was concern about leaving property behind. The third highest response when asked the reason for not evaluating from the Full County sample (14.9%) was concern about personal o r family safety, while the third highest response from the Hispanic and Latino sample (17.4%) was \"would leave\" .ii In 2013 when residents were asked the main reason they might not evacuate if asked to do so, the most common response was health problems, c ould not be moved ( 39.5%), followed by concern about leaving pets behind (1 4.7%). In 2016 only 4.8% of the Full County sample and 5.6% of the Hispanic and Latino sample would not evacuate due to health problems.ii Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues The 2016 Community Health Assessment Survey responses identified gaps and emerging issues that exist within the level of preparedness in the community. The most common of these gaps are: Community Preparedness, CDC Public Health Capability 1, Emergency Public Information and Warning, CDC Public Health Capability 4 and Mass Care, CDC Public Health Capability 7. Upon examining the data, there are key issues that need to be addressed in the future of the Public Health Emergency Preparedness pr ogram. These issues are: Community Preparedness: The survey results identified that only 37.9% of the Hispanic and Latino sample stated they had a 3- day basic emergency supply kit and emergency plan. Mass Care: The survey reveals a large number of Hispanic and Latino residents (34.8 %) would stay in an emergency shelter if asked to leave their homes during an emergency . For mass care planning purposes the capability to ensure ongoing surveillance and health assessments for non - English speaking at -risk populations will require translation services at emergency shelters. Mass Care : When asked \" what would be the main reason you might not evacuate or leave your home if asked to do so\" , top responses included concern about personal or family safety and concern for pets. These results indicate a need to better educate all Durham County residents on emergency shelter services. Recommended Strategies Issue 1, Community Preparedness : A function of the CDC Community Preparedness Capability is to coordinate training or guidance to ensure community engagement in preparedness efforts . Since only 37.9% of the Hispanic and Latino sample stated they had a 3-basic day emergency supply kit and emergency plan , the health department will continue to work with community partners to CHAPTER 12 Public Health Emergency Preparedness 296 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment identify and provide preparedness education to the at -risk populations such as the non -English speaking communities. Increasing awareness of the need to build a n emergency kit and develop a family emergency plan will decrease the confusion for non -English speaking Durham residents while improving resiliency for the whole community during an emergency . Issue 2, Emergency Public Information and Warning : The surve y results identified that the majority of Durham County residents identified television/radio , the internet and text messages as their primary source s of information. By maintaining a current knowledge of what communications platforms are being monitored by the public, the Public Information Officer (PIO) and the Joint Information Center (JIC) will be better equipped to target those media outlets during an event. Having JIC staff who are not o nly trained in Crisis Communications but can also monitor and post information on the internet and other social media platforms will be a crucial component of keeping the public informed. Issue 3, Mass Care: Top response s to the question \"where would yo u go if couldn't remain in your home due to community -wide emergency \" for both the Full County sample and the Hispanic and Latino neighborhood sample included relatives/friends and an emergency shelter. The high proportion of Hispanic and Latino residents indicating that they would stay in an emergency shelter reveals a need for ongoing surveillance and health assessments for non -English speaking at -risk populations. Translation services at the shelter will be needed to ensure adequate communication with no n- English residents. Issue 4 , Mass Care: Residents citied concern about personal and family safety and concern about their pets as main reason s they might not evacuate or leave your home if asked to do so . These concerns highlight the need to better educate all Durham County residents on emergency shelter services , which include law enforcement at all shelters and the availability of pet-friendly emergency shelters. Providing more education concerning emergency sheltering will ensu re Durham residents are not only safe while staying at an emergency shelter but their pets are provided shelter as well. Current Initiatives & Activities Public Health Preparedness The Durham County Department of Public Health has a full -time Public Health Preparedness Coordinator who writes the Durham County Department of Public Health's plans for responding to public health needs after natural and man -made disasters, as well as during communicable disease outbreaks. The Preparedness Coordinator also works to provide training and exercises, as well as outreach activities, for Durham County Department of Public Health, local community partners, and community groups. http://dcopublichealth.org/services/environmental - health/public -health -preparedness CHAPTER 12 Public Health Emergency Preparedness 297 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment References i CDC Public Health Capabilities. http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/capabilities/dslr_capabilities_july.pdf .

CHAPTER 13 Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities 298 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities This chapter includes: Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities CHAPTER 13 Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities 299 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 13.01 Older adults and adults with disabilities Overview Durham County is experiencing a substantial growth in the number and proportion of older adults due to longer life spans and aging baby boomers. This increase in the number of older adults will have a significant social and economic impact in Durham County . This also presents an opportunity to embrace older adults as a vital asset in which they contribute their experience and leadership, while continuing to add economic diversity as employers/employees and consumers . In addition to the growing older adult population , the number of adults 18-64 years old who are living with a disability is also increasing in Durham . These individuals are significantly more likely to report being in fair or poor health than adults without disabilities.i According to the North Carolina Office on Disability and Health , a disability can be physical, mental, emotional, intellectual, or communication -related and it can be present at birth or begin later in life as a result of injury, chronic disease, or aging . People wi th disabilities experience more health disparities than people without disabilities. While the determinants for these disparities are not fully understood, evidence shows low socioeconomic status, higher rates of unemployment, lower educational attainment, limited access to preventive care, and the cost of health care contribute to this disparit y.ii Seco ndary Data : Demographic Trends in Durham County and North Carolina Ages Durham North Carolina 2016 2035 % Change 2016 2035 % 0 - 17 Durham County, 2016 and 2035iii In 2030, the last baby boomers will turn 6 0. Table 1 3.01(a) shows the aging of Durham County and North Carolina. Although Durham County will have a slightly smaller proportion of older adults when compared to North Carolina, the number of older adults in Durham County will grow from 51,388 to 8 6,428, reaching an estimated 22.2% o f the total population in Durham by 2035. This represents a 30.0% increase in the less than 20 years .iv CHAPTER 13 Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities 300 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Race of Older Adults in Durham County, 2016 and 203 5 Figure 1 3(a) Race of Older Adults in Durham County, 2016 and 2035v Figure 13.01(a) and Table 1 3.01(b) demonstrate that Durham County is significantly more diverse than North Carolina. This data is important because there are documented disparities in health outcomes , physical function , and longevity based on race and ethnicity among all age groups, but especially among older adults in the United States.vi Race of Older Adults in Durham County and North Carolina, 2016 and 2035 Race (60 years and over) Durham County North Carolina 2016 2035 2016 Race of Older Adults in Durham County and North Carolina, 2016 and 2035vii Poverty Stat us of Older Adults in Durham County and North Carolina, 2016 Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months (60 years and over) Durham County North Carolina Below 100 percent of the poverty level 9.3% 10.2% 100 - 149 percent of the poverty level 8.1% 11.0% With Supplemental Security income 5.7% 6.1% With cash public assistance income 1.4% 1.5% With Food Stamp/SNAP benefits 9.2% 10.7% Table 1 3.01(c) Poverty Status of Older Adults in Durham County and North Carolina, 2016viii In 2016, 17% of older adults in Durham County were living in or near poverty.ix Across the U nited States income varies dramatically by race. In 2016, the national median income for White Medicare beneficiaries was $30,050, $17,350 for Blacks, and $13,650 for Hispanics.x Health care costs can pose a substantial financial burden for poor and low -income older adults and is one of the contributing factors as to why older adults who are at or near the poverty level are more likely to report poorer health status than older adults with higher incomes.xi In North Carolina, it is American Indian 0%Asian 3% African - American 36% Other 1%White 60%2016American African - America n 42% Other 2%White 51%2035CHAPTER 13 Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities 301 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment estimated th at 12.7% of older adults are food insecure and 60.0% of seniors who would qualify for food stamps/ SNAP do not participate in this program.xii xiii Housing Status of Older Adults in Durham County and North Carolina, 2016 Housing (60 years and over) Durham County North Carolina Owner -occupied housing units 72.0% 80.2% Gross rent 30 percent or more of household income 24.7% 24.9% Renter -occupied housing units 28.0% 19.8% Gross rent 30 percent or more of household income 54.1% 49.0% Table 1 3(d) Housing Status of Adults in Durham County and North Carolina, 2016xiv Affordable housing is an issue in Durham County, especially among older adults who rent .

They are also more likely to use tobacco, be overweight or obese , have high blood pressure, experience symptoms of psychological distress, receive less social -emotional support, have lower employment rates, and not engage in physical fitness activities.xviii CHAPTER 13 Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities 302 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Primary Data The 2016 Durham County Health Assessment Survey included these questions on older adults and adults with disabilities: xix Keeping in mind yourself and the people in your neighborhood, tell me the most important health problems, that is, diseases or conditions, in Durham County. 22.4% of responden ts in the county sample answered \"aging problems.\" Are there services and supports needed in Durham County to help improve the quality of life for adults age 60 and older? 56.4% of respondents in the county sample answered \"yes.\" The services and supports that were selected included health services (59.1%), financial assistance (59.1%), transportation (54.5%), navigating programs (40%), housing dementia care (37.3%), elder abuse/neglect (31.8%), and food (25.5%). Which services need the most impr ovement in y our neighborhood or community? 16.5% of respondents in the county sample answered \"older adult care\" and 10.2% responded \"disability services.\" What are the primary causes of stress that you experience? 27.2% of respondents in the county sample answered \"caring for family member with chronic illness/disability\" and 13.1% answered \"own disability.\" Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues A recent American Association of Retired Persons (AARP ) survey detailed that 78% of people over age 45 want to remain in their own homes for as long as possible and that 80% believe they will always live in their current community .xx A livable community is one that is safe and secure, has affordable and appropriate housing and transportation opt ions, and offers supportive community features and services. Once in place, those resources enhance personal independence, allow residents to age in place, and foster residents' engagement in the community's civic, economic, and social life.xxi A livable com munity action plan must address any barriers to aging in place that exist as a result of inequities and disparities that stem from race, poverty, and disability status. Creating a livable community can increase the contributions of both older and younger people and build a community that is better for all Durham residents. A livable community is a \"great place to grow up and grow old.\"xxii Recommended Strategies Develop an Aging Plan that includes the World Health Organization and AARP's domains of livability ( Outdoor Spaces and Buildings, Transportation, Housing, Social Participation, Respect and Social Inclusion, Civic Participation and Employment, Communication and CHAPTER 13 Older Adults and Adults with Disabilities 303 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Information, and Community and Health Service s). Continue to support the Durham Community Resource Connections for Aging & Disabilities , which works to facilitate a \"no wrong door\" to long -term service and supports by eliminating information silos among providers. Develop a Care Transitions Coalition that will connect hospitals and skilled nursing facilities with community -based organizations to ensure safe and effective transitions for older adults and adults with disabilities as they move from the hospital/nursing home back to their home. Increase access to healthy food for older adults and adults with disabilities by mapping the food ecosystem that serves older adults and adults with disabilities and increasing their knowledge about and enrollment in Food and Nutrition Services.

CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 306 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment LGBTQ+ Issues This chapter includes: Barriers to Healthcare Mental Health Economic Disparities Violence Chronic Disease Infectious Disease CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 307 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment LGBTQ+ Issues Overview Though increasing public support of marriage equality might indicate growing acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community, the LGBTQ+ community remains vulnerable to discrimination and stigma in North Carolina and nationally. Currently, no federal (or North Carolina state-level) non - discrimination laws exist to protect people on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in employment, housing, and public accommodations. Though some states and local governments, including Durham County, have passed non -discri mination legis lation for government employees , more than three out of five U .S. residents live in a jurisdiction without such protections, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Discrimination, stigma, and lack of federal or state protection result in poorer health outcomes for people who identify as LGBTQ+. Barriers to health care , higher rates of unemployment, mental health issues, higher rates of chronic and infectious disease, and in extreme cases, being victims of violence, are just a few examples of health concerns faced by the LGBTQ+ community. These topics are by no means ex haustive. The term \"LGBTQ+\" refers to a diverse community of people who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and other self -identifying terms related to gender and sexuality. This chapter will use the umbrella term LGBTQ+ t o refer to people within this community, as well as descriptors like same -sex or different -sex in reference to couples, while recognizing that these terms are not all -encompassing or monolithic. Nor is identifying as LGBTQ+ the only component of a person's identity. Indeed, race, class, and immigration status are additional elements of a person's identity that can compound the stigma and discrimination already faced as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. North Carolina is home to many members of the LGBTQ+ community. Durham County houses the second largest concentration of same -sex households among N .C. counties, with an estimated 9.7 same -sex households per 1,000 households.i According to the 2016 Durham County Community Health Assessment Survey, approximat ely 4% of residents personally identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (the options provided on the survey). An additional 5% indicated that someone in their household identified as such. In the Hispanic and Latino neighborhood sample, approximately 1% per sonally identified and 2% indicated that someone in their household identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual (note: these values were not calculated by race or gender). Less than 1% of residents surveyed in either sample reported identifying as transgender.ii These rates are higher among Durham adolescents, where data indicates as many as 12% of Durham high school students identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual, according to the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS).iii CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 308 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Many people who identify as LGBTQ+ cal l Durham home. This chapter will summarize the health challenges these community members may face on a daily basis as a result of stigma and discrimination, among other factors. One clear and consistent theme that emerged is the dearth of reference data sp ecific to Durham County to accurately depict the state of LGBTQ+ health in Durham. As a result, one of the aims of this first -time chapter in the Community Health Assessment is to present a baseline on which to build a greater understanding of the breadth of the LGBTQ+ specific healthcare challenges. CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 309 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Key terms in this Chapter Research on the experiences of LGBTQ+ communities uses a number of terms for sexual orientation and gender identity that are substantively distinct and not interchangeable. For the purposes of sharing a common language and nomenclature in this chapter, these are the definitions that will provide a framework within this chapter: Cisgender - /\"siss -jendur\"/ - adj.: A person who identifies with the gender that society assigns to them; someone who is not transgender. \"Cis\" is a latin prefix meaning \"on the same side\". You are cisgender if you do not feel conflict with the gender assigned to you at birth. Cis people can still be gender nonconforming Cisnormativity - noun : the assumption, in individuals or in institutions, that everyone is cisgender, and that cisgender identities are superior to trans or queer identities or people. Leads to invisibil ity of non -cisgende r identities Gender expression - noun : The visual, interpersonal, and behavioral methods that people use to express their gender identity. This can include personal grooming, clothing, body language, vocabulary, intonation, vocal pitch, and other behaviors . Gender identity - noun : One's innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither - how individuals perceive themselves and what they call themselves. One's gender identity can be the same or different from their sex assigned at birth (i.e., the biological sex lis ted on their birth certificate) Gender minority - adj.: A person who does not identify with the gender assigned to them at birth (and may identify as transgender, genderqueer, gender fluid, gender nonconforming, or something el se) Gender non -conforming - adj: A gender identity label that indicates people who do not subscribe to gender expressions or roles expected of them by society. Anyone who does not fit neatly into a gender role. Often abbreviated as \"GNC\" Heteronormativity - noun : the assumption, in individuals or in institutions, that everyone is heterosexual (e.g. when learning a woman is married, asking her what her husband's name is) and that heterosexuality is superior to all other sexualities. Leads to invisibility an d stigmatizing of other sexualities. Heteronormativity also leads us to assume that only masculine men and feminine women are straight LGBTQ+ - Abbreviation for terms sexual - and gender -minority people may self -identify with (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer), with the \"+\" signifying that there are many others that may not be comprehensively represented by this acronym Non-binary - adj.: A person whose gender identity does not fit the strict man/woman dichotomy.

Queer - adj.: an umbrella category used to define the whole LGBTQ+ community or as an alternative to the labels lesbian, gay, and bisexual. Due to its historical use as a derogatory term, it is not embraced or us ed by all members of the LGBTQ community. Sexual minority - adj.: A person who reports same -sex attraction, same -sex sexual behavior, or a nonheterosexual identity Transgender - adj.: Transgender is used to describe people whose gender identity is differe nt from what is typically associated with the sex assigned to them at birth.

CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 311 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 14.01 Barriers to healthcare Overview The LGBTQ+ community is a diverse group of individuals of all genders and sexualities who face health disparities linked to discrimination and societal stigma. Community members' intersecting identities of race, ethnicity, religion, and economic class compound the fact that LGBTQ+ people are discriminated against at much higher rates than heterosexual people . This results in higher rates of physical, psychological, and social health disparities such as socia l phobia, depression, preventable diseases, substance abuse, and even suicide. Experiences of discrimination, assault and victimization are also frequent among members of the LGBTQ+ community and have long - lasting effects. In particular, transgender peop le have not always benefited from seeking health care services; due to misunderstanding by professionals and the creation of a gateway system . This unhealthy relationship between the transgender community and healthcare professionals raise s many doubts for the role of health services in the lives of transgender people. Transgender people are less likely than cisgender people to have their healthcare needs met; this can be anything from vaccines and asthma, to screening for diseases and mental health service s.iv In healthcare, stigma, lack of cultural sensitivity, and unconscious and conscious neglect in addressing sexuality and gender impact the effectiveness of care. Bias and discrimination in health care settings are unethical and affect the physical, ment al and social well -being of those seeking services. Many LGBTQ+ people avoid or delay seeking healthcare because of past negative experiences, structural barriers, or an overall lack of education among providers. Similar to many oppressed or marginalized g roups of people, LGBTQ+ individuals are at an increased risk for mental and physical health problems.v Primary Data LGBTQ+ people have seemingly been left out when collecting data regarding healthcare. Healthcare forms are primarily heteronormative and cisnormative and thus lack the opportunity to collect or recognize data for LGBTQ+ persons. Primary data related to healthcare services, such as rates of LGBTQ+ provider services, insurance coverage for LGBTQ+ people, and research suggesting LGBTQ+ health disparities and/or comorbidities have not been collected at the county or state level for the LGBTQ+ population. There is a strong need for more research to document, understand, and address the environmental factors that contribute to health disparities i n the LGBTQ+ community in Durham. CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 312 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Secondary Data Stigma Gender and sexuality can be considered invisible identities. Many people who seek services may keep information regarding their gender or sexual identity hidden which prevents them from getting adequate and comprehensive services from providers . This is mostly due to fear of discrimination and a lack of trust with the healthcare field. LGBTQ+ individuals who keep their sexuality hidden are at an increased risk of psychological distress.vi This als o prevents them from accessing group -based coping resources that buffer against the negative effects of stigma. In a 2013 study of 396 LGB N ew York City residents, they found that 39% of bisexual men, 32.6% of bisexual women, 12.9% of lesbians and 10% of gay men did not report their sexual orientation to their healthcare providers .vii Discrimination LGBTQ+ individuals seeking services are also more likely to be discriminated against. According to a Lambda Legal study focusing on discrimination of transgender people in healthcare, 50% of the participants had to teach their physician how to care for them, 28% percent experienced verbal harassment in medical settings, 19% had been refused medical care, and 2% had been physically assaulted in a physician's office.viii Education According to a survey provided by Carolina Partners in Mental Healthcare, in a sample of 268 clinicians, over 65% of clinicians felt they needed more education on LGBTQ+ focused issues .ix LGBTQ+ comprehensive education is not provided in most graduate or medical programs concentrated on health professions. Most clinicians have found that workshops or continued education on LGBTQ+ issues are a necessity to providing comprehensive clinical care. Insurance In 2013 the Center for American Progress released a study on health insurance. LGBTQ+ Americans are more likely to be uninsured than their heterosexual peers. In the same study, it was found that the percentage of LGBTQ+ Americans without insurance dropped due to the Affordable Care Act ( ACA ), from 22% at the end of 2013 to 17.6 percent during the second quarter of 2014. In the same study, it was found that 25% of LGBTQ+ Americans (21% o f men and 29% of women) reported not having enough money for health care needs at least once in the past year compared to 17% of their straight peers.x CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 313 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Many people in the U .S. are uninsured, and transgender people are the least likely to have access to he althcare and specifically access to insurance. Transgender people are less likely to be employed and have more difficulty obtaining documents with the appropriate name and gender and have more difficulty applying for public insurance.xi According to the Hum an Rights Campaign's (HRC) Corporate Equality Index, 340 private companies offer one transgender - inclusive insurance plan. 28% of Fortune 500 companies cover comprehensive care for transgender employees.xii In addition to fear of denial of care, keeping identities hidden and retroactive denial of care, f inding a provider, making copayments, and travel expenses are just a few of many barriers to healthcare for the LGBTQ+ community. Eliminating LGBTQ+ barriers to service and enhancing efforts to improve LGB TQ+ health care are necessary to ensure that LGBTQ+ individuals can lead long, healthy lives. There are many benefits of addressing health concerns and reducing disparities for the community but education is the first step to providing quality and comprehe nsive services for the community. Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues When discussing LGBTQ+ limited access to healthcare, the focus is most often directed to illnesses and diseases that are more common or severe in these communities. Physical, mental, and social well -being are all critical parts of wellness. Access to health care that is safe and does not discriminate is important for overall wellness. Gaps 1. Lack of data / No accurate representation of LGBTQ+ clients in healthcare 2. Lack of education for healthcare providers 3. Lack of accountability for turning away clients 4. Lack of financial ability to seek adequate education to provide services Emerging Issues 1. Non-binary, gender fluid, and gender non -conforming identities are emerging in favor of the strict binary genders (and medical transitions) associated with \"trans men\" and \"trans women.\" 2. Transgender and gender non -binary youth are experiencing acceptance in school and with peers but not at home 3. Political figures denouncing identit ies and creating more stigma 4. Gender segregation in Durham Public Schools CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 314 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Unfortunately, there are few LGBTQ+ specific prevention services to deal with violence victimization, substance abuse, mental health concerns, and other health care needs, except in large metropolitan areas. Even then, most of these services have not been as thoroughly evaluated as HIV prevention services focusing on gay men. There is a large need for health care competency, inclusive sexuality education and educational programs that discuss LGBTQ+ disparities. Recommended Strategies A number of issues will need to continue to be evaluated and addressed, including: Collecting sexual o rientation and gender identity data in health -related surveys and health records in order to identify LGBTQ+ health disparities Appropriately inquiring about and being supportive of a patient's sexual orientation and gender identity to enhance the patient -provider interaction and regular use of care Providing medical students with training to increase pro vision of culturally competent care Implementing anti - bullying policies in schools Providing supportive social services to reduce suicide and homelessness among youth Nationally representative data on LGBTQ+ Americans Prevention of violence and homicide t oward the LGBTQ+ community, and especially the transgender population LGBTQ+ Elder health and well -being Exploration of sexual/gender identity among youth Need for a LGBTQ+ wellness model Need for LGBTQ+ and specifically transgender -oriented sexual health education Recognition of transgender health needs as medically necessary Current Initiatives & Activities LGBTQ Center of Durham Creating Visibility.

Accessed January 7, 2018 . CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 317 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 14.02 Mental health Overview The issues of discrimination and violence as ever -present concerns for LGBTQ+ people come to the forefront when issues of psychological health are concerned. Recent legislation including bills contesting marriage equality and attempting to regulate the use of public restrooms by transgender people (\"bathroom bills\") are just one of many sources of public debate about the rights and access that should be granted LGBTQ+ citizens. Throwing these debates into the limelight has resulted in increased awareness regarding LGBTQ + and s pecifically transgender issues. However, this means an increase in both acceptance and violence, and makes the issue of visibility a heavy factor in an LGBTQ+ individual's safety. On a personal level, the relationships which normally act as supports are of ten strained or even broken by the same stigma which can lead to physical violence from strangers. The constant stress of these concerns, along with the gatekeeping of necessary medical care for transgender people and barriers to resources like employment and housing inevitably lead to poor mental health. The Meyer Minority Stress Model lays out an array of both internal and external stressors which adversely affect the emotional and mental well -being of any member of a minority group.i These layers of stre ss and the obstacles they pose regarding access to resources create a unique adverse effect on the mental and emotional health of members of the LGBTQ+ community. These experiences of systemic, interpersonal violence and psychosocial stressors are magnifi ed for LGBTQ+ individuals living at the intersections of multiple, salient marginalized identities (ie. LGBTQ+ who are also disabled, undocumented, poor , or people of color, etc.). It is increasingly clear that that future research and mental health praxis must explain the within -group differences of LGBTQ+ communities and explore how the intersections of sexual identity, gender identity, sex, race/ethnicity, age, population cohort, socioeconomic status, nationality/nativity, immigration status, geographic location, and disability status inform people's lived experiences, as well as their mental health outcomes and treatment. Currently most statistics regarding LGBTQ+ mental health are considered conservative numbers . More information is needed to truly shed light on the disparities of mental health these communities face. Primary Data The impact of various levels of oppression and continued stigma are reflected in disproportionately high rates of \" poor mental health,ii-iii psychological distress,iv-viii suicidal ideation, and mental health disorders (e.g., depression and anxiety) compared with heterosexuals\" as well as higher rates of substance and drug abuse. The higher rates of mental health problems can be attributed to the systemic oppression, trauma , and stressors disproportionately endured by LGBTQ+ communities i.e. poverty, employment discrimination, housing discrimination, lack of accessible and affirming care/discrimination when accessing services, intimate partner violence, incarceration, deport ation, physical violence , murder, sexual assault, and homelessness.ix CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 318 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Due to insufficient data collected by N .C. and Durham County, this report relies heavily on national data explicating LGBTQ+ communities living in the U .S. South and will cite N .C. specific data when possible. Secondary Data North Carolina is the first Southeastern state to include sexual orientation identity on its Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), and many of the results were consistent with other studies of adult LGB populations. For example, LGB adults in North Carolina experienced poorer mental health.x-xii The North Carolina BRFSS is part of a national health surveillance system and is conducted jointly by Nor th Carolina and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This anonymous questionnaire is intended to provide data at the state and regional level about a variety of health behaviors and health outcomes. One study reviewed NC BRFSS data from 2011 (th e year that sexual orientation was first introduced in data collection efforts) to 2014 and found that m ental health was consistently poorer for sexual minorities, including: LGB men and women showed inequities in mental health, with 34.9% of gay or bisexual men and 33% of lesbian or bisexual women reporting having an average of 5 or more poor mental health days in the past month, compared to 16.0% of heterosexual men and 24.0% of heterosexual women. as Additionally, LGB men and women were three times as likely to be diagnosed with a depressive disorder compared to their heterosexual peers.xiii Sexual minority women had higher rates of alcohol abuse compared with heterosexual women and showed higher instances of binge and heavy drinking.xiv Unexpectedly, sexual minority women were more likely to experience worry or stress about paying rent or mortgage, even though they were less likely to be living below 300% Federal Poverty Guidelines ( FPG). This finding may be related to the adverse mental health sexual minority women experience.xv Overall, \"there are substantial health inequities for LGB adults living in N .C. compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Areas of concern include health status and mental health, secondhand smo ke exposure, and, for women, respiratory health, obesity, smoking, and alcohol abuse.\"xvi Pathologizing of LGBTQ+ Identities in Psychology Pathologizing is the practice of seeing a symptom as indication of a disease or disorder. In mental health, the term is often used to indicate over -diagnosis or the refusal to accept certain behavior as normal. Mental health professions have a longstanding history of p athologizing and criminalizing of LGBTQ+ identities. Until its removal from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973xvii, homosexuality was treated as a \"sociopathic personality disorder.\" While the DSM -5 reclassified \"Gender Identity Disorder\" in 2013 as \"Gender Dysphoria,\" which is no longer pathological per se, the diagnosis continues to be used to stigmatize transgender people. Multiple individual accounts have been given by LGBTQ+ and especially transgender patients regar ding attempts to \"convert\" them to cisgender and/or heterosexual identities by mental health professionals . Accounts reflect an interrupt ion in access to transgender patients' transition - related care on the basis that their identities were pathological symptoms correlated with Axis I mental health disorders such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Pathologizing LGBTQ+ CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 319 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment identities in mental health professions is reinforced and perpetuated by the lack of evidence -based data related to the mental health disparities they face. Barriers to Access Organizations from the Williams Institute to Funders of LGBTQ+ Issues have documented that 25% of LGBTQ+ identified adults in the U.S. live in the South and are more likely to \"lack employment protections, earn less than $24,000 a year, and report that they cannot afford food or healthcare...and are also less likely to have insurance than anywhere else in th e country .\" xviii,xix These disparate experiences leave low -income, LGBTQ + Southerners less likely to access mental health services when they are available. LGBTQ+ people still face gatekeeping of necessary care due to mental health providers' lack of training and/or understanding of LGBTQ+ experiences and needs. Some reports ar e concerned with providers who \"lack knowledge and experience working with members of the LGBTQ+ community may focus more on a person's sexual orientation and/or gender identity than a person's mental health condition\" .xx Throughout the research available, substantial knowledge gaps worsened by the scarcity of LGBTQ+ specific resources, data, overt discrimination , and evaluation uplifting the experiences of low -income LGBTQ+ communities are all cited as significant barrier to treatment and mental wellness for LGBTQ+ people of all ages. Substance Abuse Risks Research suggests that LGBTQ+ adults as well as youth are at greater risk for substance abuse compared with those that identify as heterosexual.xxi Many federally funded surveys have only recently begun to identify sexual minorities in their data collections. In 2015, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) added two questions on sexual orientation, one for sexual identity and one for sexual at traction, making it the first nationally representative, comprehensive source of federally collected information on substance use and mental health issues among sexual minority adults.xxii Findings specific to the mental health of Trans and Gender Non -Conforming North Carolinians included that o ver a quarter of the respondents misused drugs or alcohol specifically to cope with the mistreatment they faced due to their gender identity or expression.xxiii Mental Health and Law Enforcement Data has confirmed that LGBT Q+ people continue to be target s for human rights abuses by law enforcement in the United States, based on real or perceived gender identity and/or sexual orientation.xxiv LGBTQ+ individuals who have mental or physical disabilities, are people of color, are engaged in sex work, are undocumented, are experiencing poverty, etc. are at increased ri sk for abuse by law enforcement. xxv In addition to physical harm, these types of human rights abuses can lead to post -traumatic psychological an d psychosomatic symptoms in survivors. Transgender North Carolinians in particular experience high levels of police violence with one study citing that \"in the past year, of respondents who interacted with police or other law enforcement officers who thoug ht or knew they were transgender, 54% experienced some form of mistreatment. This included being verbally harassed, repeatedly referred to as the wrong gender, physically assaulted, CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 320 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment or sexually assaulted, including being forced by officers to engage in sex ual activity to avoid arrest.\" xxvi Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Transgender and Gender Non -Conforming Mental Health Of the 683 transgender and gender nonconforming respondents to the U .S. 2015 Transgender Survey residing in North Carolina, 15% of them were unemployed; 29% were living in poverty; 29% of those in N .C. who saw a health care provider in the past year reported being refused treatment, verbally harassed, or physically or sexuall y assaulted, or having to teach the provider about transgender people in order to get appropriate care (33% nationwide ). Twenty -six percent of N.C. respondents did not see a doctor when they needed to because of fear of being mistreated as a transgender person (23% nationwide); and 42% did not see a doctor when needed because they could not afford it (33% nationwide) .xxvi Lastly, \"a staggering 41% of respondents in a national survey reported attempting suicide compared to 1.6% of the general population\" .xxvii This presents a compelling case for a profound gap in healthcare and mental healthcare provision for transgender people in North Carolina. The U.S. 2015 Transgender Survey did not release more specific data regarding the individual states covered in their data, but the national data for mental health among transgender people is as follows :xxviii Lifetime incidence of suicidal ideation that resulted in planning was a staggering 82% of the subjects surveyed. Lifetime incidence of attempted suicide was 40%, which is almost ten times the national average at 4.6%. Significantly, the percentage of Ame rican Indian respondents who had ever made an attempt was the highest risk group when racially divided at 57%, followed by Multiracial at 50% and Black at 47%. The age of first attempt was most frequently reported as being under the age of 13 (34%) or betw een the ages of 14 and 17 (39%), indicating a serious need for mental health care for transgender youth. Overall, 29% of respondents reported illicit drug use, marijuana consumption, and/or nonmedical prescription drug use in the past month, nearly t hree times the rate in the U.S. population (10%). Another area of growing concern with regard to transgender healthcare is the lack of data regarding the mental health of transitioning and surgical patients. While there is some data available for the ment al health aftereffects of invasive and/or significant surgical procedures in general, none at all exists that records the process of recovery from gender confirmation surgery. Additionally, the mental health of patients on hormone replacement therapy has n ot been statistically measured or recorded in any amount that would reflect meaningful data. CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 321 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Bisexuality and Mental Health According to recent studies people who identify as bisexual are far more likely to experience depression and poorer mental health.xxix Bisexuals have higher suicidality rates: one study found bisexuals were four times more likely and lesbian and gay adults two times more likely to report attempted suicide than straight adults.xxx Alarmingly, bisexuals are also far more likely to feel suicidal than their heterosexual, gay, and lesbian counterparts. Studies found that bisexual men were 6.3 times more likely to seriously consider suicide in their lifetime and gay men 4.1 times more li kely than straight men; with bisexual women at 5.9 times more likely and lesbian/gay women 3.5 times more likely than straight women.xxxi A recent study in the Journal of Adolescent Health found that bisexual teens who reported suicidal thoughts did not re port a decrease in these thoughts as they aged into adulthood, unlike their straight peers .xxxii Despite these disparities, and perhaps compounding them, bisexual people are less likely than gay men or lesbians to be out to their health care providers. The body of research on bisexual health is growing, but more data is always helpful when trying to show the health disparities facing bisexuals. LGBTQ+ Americans face higher rates of poverty, unemployment, and negative health outcomes than straight Americ ans, but among LGB people, bisexuals face disproportionately higher rates of these negative outcomes than lesbians and gay men.xxxiii This may be because bisexual people face discrimination from within the LGBTQ+ community as well as outside of it. Crisis Prevention & Extended Care There is currently no statistical data available regarding LGBTQ+ people and their relationship with crisis care. However, a growing need has been indicated simply by the increase in statistical data regarding LGBTQ+ and especi ally transgender people's use of substances, concerns about mental health, and barriers to regular, extended care from affirming primary care providers. Youth & Aging What individuals need varies throughout their lives. What is known is that the impact of various levels of oppression are reflected in higher rates of substance abuse and depression, disproportionately high rates of unemployment, and that 20 -40% of all homeless youth identify as LGBTQ .xxxiv The research over the past several decades about the lives and experiences of LGBTQ youth ( youth is loosely defined as adolescents to young adults ages 13 -24) overwhelming ly links suicide and suicidality with a non -heterosexual identity .xxxv, xxxvi, xxxvii There is very little information being gathered on the particular needs of the elders in the LGBTQ+ community, partly because of the lowered life expectancy of LGBTQ+ and particularly transgender people. As awareness of this problem grows, ideally ne w light will be shed on this emergent population.

During adolescence, LGBTQ+ youth are signific antly more likely to be homeless.i During adulthood, LGBTQ+ individuals and couples often have lower incomes, lower rates of health insurance, and higher rates of public assistance and economic strain (e.g. food insecurity, forgone care due to cost, etc.).ii At the macro level, the current political climate nationwide and in North Carolina, in particular add additional risk for such disparities. In the absence of non - discrimination policies, LGBTQ+ individuals are not protected against discrimination in employment or housing, which in turn may contribute to economic vulnerability and poverty. These economic stressors are linked with negative health outcomes in the LGBTQ+ population, such as higher smoking rates and depression.iii Given the size of Durham's L GBTQ+ population \u2014 Durham County has the second largest concentration of same -sex households across all counties in the state (and the 42nd highest concentration nationwide) \u2014 these economic disparities are crucial to consider when working to improve the h ealth of all Durham County residents.iv Primary Data Primary data related to economic vulnerability, such as poverty rates, employment, housing and homelessness, and food insecurity have not been collected at the county or state level for the LGBTQ+ population. Secondary Data Many LGBTQ+ individuals have experienced some form of job or housing discrimination in their lifetime. In one study of 662 lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults, over 11% had experienced job discrimination and/or housing discrimination at one point in their life with rates highest among gay men (1 5.7%) and lowest among bisexual men (3. 4%). Lesbian (16. 0%) and bisexual (6. 4%) women fall in between.v Among transgender individuals specifically, the 2015 National Transgender D iscrimination Survey found that 15% of transgender adults in North Carolina were unemployed (three times higher than the 5% national unemployment rate at the time of the survey), and 29% were living in poverty (twice the nation al poverty rate of 14%). Over 13% had lost their job due to their gender identity/expression, and 30 % either were fired, denied a promotion, or were not hired due to their transgender identity in the previous year alone. In addition, over 23 % had experienced housing discrimination (e.g. evicted or denied housing due to being transgender), and 12% had experienced homelessness in the previous year as a result of being transgender.vi Several federal surveys have measured economic outcomes among LGBTQ+ adults at the national level. In one study using the 2013 and 2014 waves of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a nationally representative survey of health conditions, functional status, and service access/utilization, several disparities emerged between bisexual, lesbian, and h eterosexual CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 327 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment women.vii In general, bisexual women fared the worst: over a quarter of bisexual women (25.9%) reported a household income below the federal poverty level (compared with 14.9% heterosexual and 15.2% lesbian women), and 16.6% were unemployed \u2014approximately twice the unemployment rate of lesbian women (8.4%) and almost four times that of heterosexual women (4.5%).viii Bisexual (19.3%) and lesbian (17.4%) women were also more likely to be uninsured than heterosexual women (13.2%), and to have been unable to obtain medical care due to cost in the previous year (14.7% bisexual vs. 17.2% lesbian vs. 7.9% were also more likely than heterosexual or gay men to be uninsured or to have forgone care, yet gay men were less likely to be uninsured than heterosexual men.x The Figure below presents findings from the 2012 -2014 Gallup Daily Tracking poll (annual national survey of adults aged 18 and over ). LGBTQ+ adults were almost 1.5 times more likely than non -LGBT adults to not have enough money for health care, over 1.6 times more likely than non-LGBT to not have enough money for food, and were approximately 1.7 times more likely to report a household in come below $24,000. Note that LGBT is used to reflect the term referenced in the poll.xi Economic Disparities in LGBTQ+ Communities, United States, 2012 -2014 Data on the socioeconomic status ( SES) of LGBT North Carolinians is mixed. Findings from the 2011 -2014 waves of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a national survey of demographics and health of U .S. adults (aged 18 and older), indicat e that gay or bisexual - identified men in North Carolina were significantly more likely than heterosexual men to be a college graduate.xii However, gay or bisexual men did not report significantly higher household incomes or significantly higher rates of employment than heterosexual men, which suggests additional factors, such as workplace discrimination or stigma about their identity .xiii Women fared a bit better: lesbian/bisexual women were significantly more likely to be employed than heterosexual women and were more likely to be college educated. Lesbian/bisexual women were more likely to be poor (income <$15,000) and less likely to be hig h-income earners (>$75,000), though differences were non -significant.xiv 303348 21 2028 0102030405060 Unable to afford health care in last yearLack enough money for food in last yearHousehold income below $24kPercent LGBT Adults Non-LGBT Adults Figure 14.03(a) : Economic Disparities in LGBTQ+ Communit ies, United States, 2012 -2014xi CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 328 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Gay and bisexual men make 10 percent to 32 percent less than straight men working similar jobs. The pay gap for gay and bisexual men holds true even when controlling for occupation, education, and geographical region.xv While lesbian and bisexual women ten d to fair better than straight women in pay, lesbian and bisexual women still make less than gay, bisexual, or straight men due to the gender pay gap.xvi Lesbians appear to earn more than their heterosexual counterparts which may be in equal parts because they may benefit from higher levels of education, as well as the types of jobs they might hold.xvii Accordin g to economist Joe Clark lesbians are \"overrepresented in male -dominated professions that pay better than female -dominated professions.\"xviii Thoug h as first blush that might sound positive, it does not change that those higher earning lesbians are \"still more likely to be subjected to on -the harassment or discrimination because of their sexual orientation\".xix Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues North Carolina currently does not prohibit employment, housing, or public accommodation discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation/gender identity, nor does statewide hate crime legislation include sexual orientation/gender identity as protected cla sses.xx Though there is limited data on the direct impact of these policies among LGBTQ+ North Carolinians, evidence suggests that the absence of these policies may substantially affect their economic well -being. An analysis of the 2012 -2014 Gallup Trackin g Poll found that 15% LGBT adults in North Carolina were unemployed, relative to 8% non -LGBT peers, and 47% LGBT adults (vs. 28% non -LGBT adults) had household incomes below $24,000 (the average federal poverty level for a household of four).xxi Furthermor e, a national report from 2014 found that when economic outcomes were compared in states with and without laws offering protections, LGBTQ+ adults in states without protections were more likely to report a household income below $24,000 than LGBTQ+ adults in states with protections (35% vs. 29%, respectively).xxii In addition, 30% of LGBTQ+ adults in states without protections had experienced food insecurity (e.g. not enough money for food), compared to 19% of LGBTQ+ adults in states with protections, and 1 8% non - LGBTQ+ adults nationwide.xxiii Youth LGBTQ+ youth are particularly vulnerable to economic disparities in the form of homelessness compared to non -LGBTQ+ youth. A 2012 survey of 354 homeless youth shelters across the United States found that 43% of all youth clients at drop -in centers and 30% of youth clients at housing programs identified as LGBTQ+ \u2014 46% of whom ran away due to family rejection of their LGBTQ+ identity, and 43% of whom were kicked out.xxiv LGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness struggle not only to find a stable housing situat ion but also in securing employment.xxv These youth often end up being victims of assault. For example, one in three LGBTQ+ homeless youth have been victims of a hate crime because of their sexual orientation and/or gender identity.xxvi CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 329 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Multiple Identit ies Additional components of an LGBTQ+ person's identity can compound the discrimination they face. This is particularly true for transgender people of color and undocumented transgender individuals. According to the 2015 U .S. Transgender Survey, a national survey of 27,715 transgender/gender non -conforming adults, not only were respondents overall twice as likely as the U.S. population to be living in poverty (2 9% vs 14%), these rates were substantially higher for people of co lor. Latino/a/x (43%), American Indian (41%), multiracial (40%), and Black/African - American (38%) respondents were nearly three times as likely to be living in poverty.xxvii Fifty percent of undocumented respondents of the same survey had experienced homel essness in their life.xxviii Recommended Strategies Federal and state non -discrimination legislation for employment and housing that recognizes gender identity and sexual orientation as protected classes Advance racial equity within institutions to minimize or reverse discriminatory policies Housing programs and services for LGBTQ+ youth should be tailored to their needs, including dedicated funding for such services Establish schools as a refuge for LGBTQ+ youth by enforcing strict anti -bullying and anti- harassment policies and developing an inclusive environment Raising the minimum wage to $15 would reduce poverty rates in the LGBTQ+ community Current Initiatives & Activities LGBTQ Center of Durham The LGBTQ Center of Durham is committed to improving the lives of LGBTQ+ people who live in and around Durham.

CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 332 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 14.04 Violence Overview The World Health Organization (WHO) defines interpersonal violence as violence between individuals, which can be broadly subdivided into 1) family and intimate partner violence , that is, violence by family and intimate partners both in and outside the home; and 2) community violence , that is, violence by other persons, whether known or unknown to the victim. The nature of violence can be physical, sexual, psychological or throu gh deprivation or neglect.i Violence prevention is the province of public health, as doing so not only improves the physical and mental well -being of the collective community, but the lives of those most at risk. However, devising violence prevention pr ograms, interventions, and policies requires not only identifying those individuals and groups at risk, but mobilization and collective action by the community at large. Though evidence specific to North Carolina and Durham County are scarce, it is criti cal to discuss what is known about violence against the LGBTQ+ community in this report. National evidence suggests that sexual and gender minorities are at greater risk for multiple forms of interpersonal violence than the general public .ii,iii By highlig hting the known evidence of violence against the LGBTQ+ community, organized across the WHO's typography of violence , there is hope in the Durham LGBTQ+ community to foster the political will to collect information on LGBTQ+ interpersonal violence at the l ocal level. Primary Data Four percent of the sample in the 2016 Community Health Assessment Survey self-identified as sexual minorities and 5% noted a member of a sexual minority lived in their household. This means a notable proportion of the Durham community is at heightened risk for violence in ways that will be fully described below. As noted above, the lack of primary data on this topic is a main concern. Secondary Data Violence against LGBTQ+ Youth The life -course approach model theorizes that health is the \" product of risk behaviors, protective factors, and environmental agents that we encounter throughout our entire lives and that have cumulative, additive, and even multiplicative impacts on specific outcomes.\"iv For LGBTQ+ youth, the ris k of violence begins early, subjecting these youth to negative impacts that could create further trauma later in their life.v LGBTQ+ youth are more likely than their cisgender and/or heterosexual counterparts to have been the victim of physical and sexual abuse by a caregiver.vi,vii Bisexual and lesbian adult women were twice as likely to be victims of sexual abuse as children, CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 333 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment and gay and bisexual men five times as likely to be victims of sexual abuse as children, compared to their heterosexual counterpart s.viii LGBTQ+ youth are also at risk of family rejection as a result of their sexual/gender minority identity, and as such, many LGBTQ+ youth either run away or are kicked out of their home. Similar rates have been seen among transgender individuals: over 10% 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey ( USTS ) transgender respondents reported experiencing violence from a family member, and 8% were kicked out of their house during adolescence because they were a gender minority.ix LGBTQ+ youth also face increased risk for violence, harassment, and victimization within schools and among peers. In a meta -analysis, Friedman and colleagues found that gender and sexual minority youth are also 1.7 times more likely to be threatened with a weapon or otherwise assault at their school than sexual non -minority youth.x In North Carolina, the cohort of the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), a national survey of school -based adolescents in grades 9 -12, LGB - identified students were over twice as likely as heterosexual identified students to have been threatened or injured with a weapon on school property . The prevalence of having been bullied on school property was higher among gay, lesbian, and bisexual students (34.2%) than heterosexual stud ents (18.8%) and not sure students (24.9%) and higher among not sure students (24.9%) than heterosexual students (18.8%).xi Evidence from the 2015 U .S. Transgender Survey (USTS) found that transgender youth similarly experience an especially high rate of violence in school; among the more than 27,000 transgender adults surveyed, over half (54%) stated they experienced harassment in school during grades 9 -12, and approximately one quarter experienced physical assault.xii Within schools, LGBTQ+ youth may a lso face discrimination from teachers and administrations in addition to their peers. In the 2013 School Climate Survey of 8 ,000 LGBT students between the ages of 13 and 21 recruite d from across the country, 39.8 % students had ever received suspension, been suspended , or expelled with rates highest among LGBTQ youth of color (46.7% Black vs. 44.1% Hispanic vs. 47.3% multiracial students, compared with 36.3% White students).xiii At the same time, over half of LGBT students had experienced some form of administrative/policy - related discrimination: 15.5% were prevented from wearing clothing that supported LGBT issues, almost 18% had ever been prevented from forming a GSA (Gay -Straight Alliance) or similar official club, and o ver 28% stated they had been disciplined for public displays of affection that were not punished when done by heterosexual/cisgender couples.xiv Among transgender students in particular, policies around gender presentation, and bathroom use in particular ( similar to North Carolina's HB2 \"bathroom bill\") were a huge source of concern: 42% transgender students had been prevented from using preferred name, 59% had been required to use the bathroom of their Figure 14.04(a) Youth Experience of Violence xi CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 334 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment legal sex, and 32% had been disciplined for wearing cl othing deemed \"inappropriate\" for their legal sex.xv At school, this can create an unsafe environment that leads sexual and gender minority youth being to be more likely to skip school, or even potentially drop out.xvi,xvii For example, in the N .C. YRBS, almost 13 % LGB -identified students vs. less than 6 % heterosexual -identified students did not go to school at least once in the month before the survey because they felt unsafe.xviii Within the School Climate Survey, over 3% LGBTQ students stated they did not plan to graduate high school, with rates substantially higher among transgender students (7.6%). Students who were homeless (8.8%), and those who had experienced victimization as a result of their sexual orientation/gender identity, cited reason for not graduating as the hostile environment encountered at school.xix Within the USTS , nearly one-fifth (17%) of transgender adults who had dropped out of school did so due to their mist reatment.xx Taken together, such school -based violence and discrimination can be thought of as contributing to a \"school -to-prison\" or \"school -to-poverty\" pipeline by leading to under - or off -time educational attainment . This leads to subsequent negative l ong-term consequences for health and socioeconomic status. Intimate Partner Violence High quality information on intimate partner violence (IPV) within the LGBTQ+ community is difficult to obtain , as sexual orientation and gender identity is often not included in many national surveillance surveys or data. Additionally, IPV screening and intervention among LGBTQ+ persons (and gay men in particular) is much less common within medical settings despite increasing screening rates among heterosexual women.xxi,xxii However, systematic reviews of the existing literature suggest that rates of IPV among sexual minorities in general are the same or somewhat higher than non -minorities .xxiii-xxv Bisexual women in particular are at higher risk for IPV than either se xual non -minority women or gay men, more frequently experiencing sexual victimizations by their male partners.xxvi,xxvii Evidence from existing national surveys largely corroborate these findings. The 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS),xxviii a survey of 18,000+ adults across all 50 states and the District of Columbia, found that sexual minorities, and bisexuals in particular, were more likely than heterosexuals to have experienced numerous forms of IPV . Among women, appro ximately 61% bisexuals (translating to an estimated two million and 44% lesbians (estimated 714,000), versus 35% heterosexuals (38,290,000) had ever experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner. Bisexual women were a lso significantly more likely than heterosexual women to have experienced other forms of sexual violence (such as unwanted sexual contact or sexual coercion), and severe physical violence specifically (e.g. kicked, choked/suffocated, had knife/gun used on them, etc.). Among men, somewhat similar trends emerged, with bisexual men at highest risk, however, gay men, rather than straight men, were the least at risk. A review of existing research conducted by the Williams Institute found that lifetime prevalence of IPV in the transgender community ranged from 31.1% - 50%.xxix Sexual Violence and Sexual Assault outside of intimate relationships LGBTQ+ individuals are also at risk for sexual violence and sexual assault outside of the confines CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 335 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment of intimate partnerships. Over 47% of USTS transgender respondents stated they had ever been sexually assaulted . Furthermore, 10% had been assaulted in the previous year with the vast majority of assaults (66%) committed by someone other than an intimate partner. Rate s were also substantially higher among transgender adults of color \u2014 65% American Indian, 58% Middle Eastern, 53% Black, and 59% multiracial transgender adults (vs. 45% white) had ever been sexually assaulted.xxx A recent systematic review of over 75 studie s of sexual assault by sexual orientation found that LGB adults were at substantially increased risk for lifetime sexual assault and childhood sexual assault, with risk highest among lesbian and bisexual women.xxxi Hate Crimes and Community level violence The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) noted that in 2015 , 17.7% of single -bias incidents of hate crimes were attributed to the victim's sexual orientation and 1.7% by gender -identity bias; one-fifth of hate crimes were directed towards gender and se xual minorities collectively.xxxii Coupled with being a smaller community but victim to a higher rate of hate crimes, members of the LGBTQ+ communities are more likely than any other minority (including religious, racial or ethnic) to be victim of hate crimes.xxxiii The New York Times , using FBI hate crimes data, found that LGBTQ+ individuals are twice as likely to be a victim of a hate crime than African -Americans.xxxiv Within North Carolina specifically, approximately 23% (n=37) of the 162 hate crimes in 2015 were attributed to sexual orientation . This is a substantial increase from 2014, where sexual orientation bias accounted for only 16% of crimes ( n=23 ).xxxv -xxxvii The Human Rights Campai gn in collaboration with Trans People of Color Coalition, have documented 102 transgender victims of violence since 2013, the year official nationwide tracking and documentation began. Of these 102 victims, 87 were people of color, 88 were transgender women, the majority were und er the age of 35, and 55 were killed in the South, 3 specifically in North Carolina.xxxviii Since the publication of the report and corresponding figures shown below, a 31 -year old black transgender woman was murdered in Oklahoma. This brings the 2017 coun t to 26, the deadliest year for transgender women and a steady rise since 2015. Figures 14.04(b) through 14.04(d) illustrate the harsh realities of the rates of murder of transgender folks in the U.S. Notes: 1. This figure is based on data as of November 6, 2017. It is compiled based on information provided by Police and news reports which may not always be complete or fully accurate. 2. Since the publication of the report and the corresponding figures shown in Figure 14.04(b) to the left, a 31 -year old black transgender woman was murdered in Oklahoma. That brought the 2017 count to 26, the deadliest year for transgender women and a steady rise since 2015. Figure 14.04(b) Violence Against Transgender People 2013 -2017 xxxviii CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 336 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Many LGBTQ+ persons also experience violence, discrimination, and harassment when engaging with existing institutions. In addition to the aforementioned increased rates of discipline and punishment experienced by LGBTQ+ youth in schools, evidence suggests that LGBTQ+ adults (and transgender adults in particular) also may be disproportionately disciplined. For example, gender minorities often experience mistreatment by the police: 58% of transgender USTS respondents stated they had experienced at least some form of maltreatment (including harassment, physical or sexual assault, and transphobic comments) from a police offi cer in the previous year, with 20% specifically reporting verbal harassment, 4% reporting physical assault, and 3% experiencing sexual assault by officers.xxxix Additionally, undocumented transgender immigrants face high rates of sexual violence while inca rcerated in detention centers with 25% of substantiated incidents of sexual abuse involving a transgender individual.xl Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Data are the foundation of public health interventions.xli They allow a community to describe a problem and decide on how to prioritize resources to address the issues. There is an alarming lack of data to describe the issue of violence against the LGBTQ+ community in Durham and beyond. The issues are threefold: 1. Under reporting to Police . Sexual minorities are less comfortable reporting to the police due to fears of being outed or being skeptical their assailant would be charged.xlii,xliii Among gender minority communities, almost half (46%) report being uncomfortable seeking police assistance.xliv Less than half (44%) of violent crime is reported nationally . This rate is even less among LGBTQ+ victims at 20%, lower than the rate of reporting for property crimes (35%).xlv Among gender minorities, the rate of reporting to the police is even lower; only 11% of physical and 9% of sexual assaults against trans men and women are reported to police.xlvi 2. Specificity of reporting . When violence is reported to the police, it may not be accurately classified as a hate crime to help the community track violence as a result of anti-LGBTQ+ biases. Figure 14.04(d) Transgender Violence 2013 -2017, By State Figure 14.04(c) Tra nsgender Violence 2013 -2017, By Race CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 337 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment 3. Reporting about police . When LGBTQ+ people are being harassed by the police, especially LGBTQ+ persons of color, how, and are, those confli cts captured? Without these data Durham cannot fully describe the issue of violence, decide how to tackle the issue, pursue funding for anti -LGBTQ+ violence efforts, or evaluate the success or failures of future interventions. Below are opportunities for filling gaps in data: Police records that identify the bias for a hate crime. (e.g. against a sexual or gender minority, a racial minority, etc.) xlvii,xkviii Use a trans -inclusive hate crime Training Manual and Hate Crimes Statistics Form for law enforcement agencies Require that gender identity and sexual orientation data be collected whenever demographic data is collected in programs for victims of crime with responses being optional. Recommended Strategies For preventing violence, McKay and colleagues recommend three main strategies to prevent LGBTQ+ victimization: 1. Safer environments of LGBTQ+ youth . This includes cultural competency training for teachers and school psychologists to understand LGBTQ+ issues and developing gay - straight alliances, which have shown to lower bullying.xlix 2. Improve and expand resources for LGBTQ+ victims . McKay notes that \"affirming and culturally responsive services for LGBTQ+ victims are critical\" especially since victims must \"disclose one or more stigmatized experiences\" such as being a member of a sexual or gender minority or being a victim of violence within their fam ily.l 3. Address policies that reinforce discrimination . Policies such as HB2 and HB142 reinforce bigotry. Violence against LGBTQ+ persons is better served by policies that create a \"nondiscriminatory climate a t the societal and organizational levels.\" li Related to policing specifically, we recommend strategies such as: Better and proactive investigations of law enforcement personnel who have engaged in misconduct or abuse, including by independent commissions comprised of Durham community members. De-escalation and cultural competency training for police when working with gender and sexual minorities. Current Initiatives & Activities Durham Crisis Response Center DCRC works with the community to end domestic and sexual violence through advocacy, education, support and prevention. In an initiative that begins in 2018, DCRC will have a collaborative effort with the LGBTQ Center of Durham to provide support and coordination of services for LGBTQ+ survivors, including crisis intervention, case manage ment, safety support services, support groups, and advocacy. www.durhamcrisisresponse.org CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 338 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment References i.

CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 341 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 14.05 Chronic disease Overview LGBTQ+ health comprises not only unique challenges, but also varying rates for prevalence and incidence of certain diseases.i,ii Research suggests that LGBTQ+ individuals face health disparities linked to societal stigma, discrimination, and denial of their civil and human rights.iii In addition, subsets of the LGBTQ+ population face unique issues. For example, lesbians may be at a higher risk for developing certain types of cancers, but utilize various screening tests at a much lower rate.iv,v,vi Research has also demonstrated that lesbians have increased rates of tobacco usage, higher comorbidity rates and higher incidence of unre ported domestic violence.vii,viii Conversely, gay men face special issues in regards to sexually transmitted diseases and increased cancer risk related to the human papillomavirus. Gay men have an increased incidence of illegal substance abuse, successful suicide completion, and Hepatitis A infections.ix,x These types of special issues also extend to transgender patients, who are at an increased risk of complications from cross - gender hormones, gender reassignment surgeries and injection of non -medical grad e silicone.xi Primary Data Unfortunately, there is a stark lack of primary data available within the current Durham LGBTQ+ population as it relates to chronic disease. As such, it would be prudent to continue efforts to collect sexual orientation and gender identity data within future community health assessments, until such time that large enough sample sizes can be collected to more accurately characterize the LGBTQ+ community. Secondary Data This section focuses on four main categories that fall within the realms of chronic disease. It is crucial to note that local data specific to Durham County is lacking and there is a need for conducting research with the LGBTQ+ local community. The data presented are from nat ional studies and w hile it can be extrapolated that these statistics will also apply to the Durham LGBTQ+ community. Though there are other chronic disease that the LGBT Q+ population are at an increased risk of, the four focused on are on heart disease, ca ncer, smoking and eating disorders. Heart Disease Studies have suggested that the lesbian, gay and bisexual population are at an increased risk for developing heart disease.xii-xiv Specifically , lesbians have an increased prevalence of physical inactivity, obesity and smoking . Bisexual women are more likely to report higher smoking rates, higher blood pressure levels, increased body mass index ( BMI ), higher cholesterol levels and higher alcohol usage. xii-xiv Similarly, gay and bisexual men have an increased prevalence of tobacco and alcohol usage.xiv CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 342 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Cancer Though more data on cancer prevalence is needed, existing studies have indicated that the lesbian and gay communities have disproportionately higher rates of certain types of cancer.xv Studies have demonstrated that in comparison to their heterosexual counterparts, lesbians have higher rates of both breast and cervical cancer.xvi Limited studies have illustrated that these varying rates may be secondary to lower rates of screening mammograms and Pap smears.xvii,xviii In addition, t he limited research available shows t hat lesbians have more risk factors associated with both cervical and breast cancer including obesity and high -fat diets, smoking and alcohol abuse, having never been pregnant, and decreased breast feeding.xix,xx Gay men have been shown to have higher rates of prostate , testicular and colorectal cancers. The higher rates of incidence of these specific cancers are postulated to be secondary to more risk factors associated with these types of cancer, most notably repeated exposure to HPV in men who engage in receptive anal sex.xx,xxii Smoking Members of the LGBT population have been shown to have the highest smoking rates of any sub - population . Contributing factors includ e social stigma, stress, depression and cultural influences.xxiii-xxix The two graphs below depict the percentage of smoking among LGB v ersus heterosexual individuals and cisgender versus transgender individuals. Eating Disorders Research suggests that the LGBTQ+ community suffers from increased rates of various forms of disordered eating and unhealthy lifestyles. Lesbians are not as physically active as their Percent of Transgender and Cisgender Individuals who Smoke, U.S., 2015 35.5 20.7 Transgender Cisgender Percent of LGB and Heterosexual Individuals who Smoke, U.S., 2015 Figure 14.05(a): Per cent of LGB and Het erosexual Indivi duals who Smoke, U.S., 201523 Figure 14.05(b): Percent of Transgender and Cisgender Individuals who Smoke, U.S., 201529 CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 343 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment heterosexual counterparts and are also more likely to be overweight or o bese.30,31,32 Highest rates of obesity within the lesbian population occur in those who are African -American, live in rural or urban areas, have lower levels of education and lower socioeconomic levels.xxx, xxxi, xxxii Conversely, gay men are more likely to have issues with personal body image, more fear of being fat, higher levels of dissatisfactions with their bodies and holding distorted beliefs about the importance of having an ideal physique.xxxiv , xxxv As such, gay men are more likely to suffer from bulimia and anorexia nervosa, with the graph below depicting unhealthy dieting and binge eating disorders within this population.xxxvi Unhealthy Dieting and Binge Eating Disorders, U.S., 1994 Figure 14.05(c ): Unhealthy Dieting and Binge Eating Disorders, U.S., 1994 36 Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues It is evident that the LGBTQ+ population experiences disparities and gaps when it comes to chronic diseases. These disparities are exacerbated by a shortage of healthcare providers who are knowledgeable, culturally competent and comfortable in providing high quality LGBTQ+ healthcare. Lack of health insurance coverage or underinsurance adds another layer of complexity. Lack of standar dized sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI ) data within electronic medical records (EMR) limits the data that can be collected. Finally, a shortage of research and funding for LGBTQ+ related studies further complicates the picture. Recommended Strategies The following is a bulleted list of recommended strategies for beginning to address LGBTQ+ disparities and gaps as they relate to chronic disease: Mandating the collection of SOGI data in health -related surveys and electronic medical records Providing training in health education programs (medical schools, residency, nursing schools, P hysician Assistant programs, etc.) that focuses on LGBTQ+ health topics 17% 14% 4.20%3.40% Gay Men Heterosexual LGBTQ+ Issues 344 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Providing education to the LGBTQ+ community in regards to health promotion and prevention strategies that should be undertaken, including the importance of certain screenings and vaccinations Ensuring that ALL patients have equal access to affordable and comprehensive health insurance Creating welcoming and friendly healthcare environments wi th visible non -discrimination policies that foster trust and encourage disclosure Mandating that federal grant funding be set aside for researchers to continue to investigate LGBTQ+ inclusive issues CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 345 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment References i.

CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 348 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Section 14.0 6 Infectious disease Overview Of the many ways LGBTQ -associated stigma affects health and well -being, it too contributes to the disproportionate rates of infectious diseases, specifically sexually transmitted infections, affecting the community. With the increasing prevalence of HIV/ sexually transmitted infections (STIs ) in the southeastern U .S. over the last decade, the concentration of cases has shifted from urban areas to more rural regions with traditionally low LGBTQ + visibility and support, presenting additional barriers to preventative medical services and care.i Rising rates of HIV/ STIs i n the southeast are also fueled by abstinence -emphasized sex education, HIV -stigma, poverty, lack of health insurance and medical care access, harsh HIV/STI criminalization laws, and compounding racial and ethnic discrimination.ii Prevalent mental health and substance use issues within the LGBTQ + community further contribute to the rates of HIV/STIs as risk factors and modes of transmission.iii,iv,v Though a national decline in annual HIV rates has been documented, these declines have not been reflected through all demographics and age cohorts.vi Sparse data is available in regards to HIV/STIs among the transgender community often attributed to inaccurate gender documentation. Research suggests the transgender community carries a high burden of HIV and STI prevalence owing to heightened factors men tioned previously, as well as low social support and high rates of homelessness leading to participation in commercial sex work for economic survival.vii Lesbian and bisexual women have also been historically understudied for sexual behavior and activity a nd therefore their HIV/STI risk may not be accurately assessed resulting in inconsistent HIV/STI screenings and a false notion of susceptibility.viii To adequately combat rising HIV/STI rates within the LGBTQ + community, medical services and support must appropriately address the multi -layered identities, sexualities, and genders of the population and how these aspects predispose them to additional risk factors, increasing susceptibility to HIV/STIs. Secondary Data Between 2008 and 2014, annual nationwide HIV infections dropped 18% overall due in large part to increased knowledge of HIV status, emphasis on viral suppression as a means to inhibit HIV transmission, and increased uptake in pre -exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection. ix However, this overall decline in HIV infections was not shared amongst all groups. While the HIV rates in men who have sex with men (MSM) overall remained stable, this same time period saw a 35% jump in rates for 25 -34 year old MSM and a 20% increase for L atinx MSM.x In North CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 349 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Carolina, the rate of newly diagnosed HIV rates have remained relatively stable since 2012 after peaking in 2007 -2008 as seen in the figure below.xi North Carolina Newly Diagnosed Prevalence Rates, New HIV Infection Rates, and HIV - related Death Rates Figure 14.06(a). North Carolina HIV Rates 2000 -2016 xii Though Durham County has seen a decrease in new HIV rates over recent years, the county's rate remains higher than the state average and ranks as the fifth highest rate of newly diagnosed HIV from 2014 -2016. Approximately 1,920 Durham County residents are living with HIV as of 2016.xiii Trend in Newly Diagnosed HIV Rate, North Carolina and Durham County Figure 14.06(b). Trend in Newly Diagnosed HIV Rate, North Carolina and Durham County xiv Similar to nationwide trends, the Black and Latinx communities in Durham County carry a disproportionate burden of HIV with a rate over 6 times as high among Black residents and almost 15.3 13.424.6 20.3 0102030 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015Rate per 100,000 Population NC Durham County CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 350 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment three times as high among Latinx residents compared to white residents during 2013 -2015. During this time period, MSM in Durham County accounted for 70.8% of new HIV infections with 52.6% of new infections occurring between the ages 20 -29 from 2013 -2015.xv The rates of syphilis, gonorr hea, and chlamydia all saw increases throughout the state from 2015 to 2016. In 2016, Black men accounted for over 50% of new syphilis cases and Black men and women comprised 50% of gonorrhea and 35% of chlamydia cases.xvi Durham County had the second -highest rate of newly diagnosed early syphilis throughout the state's counties. The rate was the highest in the Black community and from 2013 -2015, Durham County males accounted for 88.5% of cases.xvii Trend in Newly Diagnosed Early Syphilis, North Carolina and Durham County Figure 14.06(c). Trend in Newly Diagnosed Early Syphilis, North Carolina and Durham County xviii From 2013 -2015, women accounted for 69.1% of chlamydia cases in Durham County.xix Men who have sex with men account for about 75% of syphilis cases in Durham Countyxx The rate of Syphilis and HIV co -infection in men has remained stable from 2014 -2016 at 49%.xxi Of increasing concern are rising rates of viral hepatitis . Preliminary N .C. data between 2014 and 2016 show a 56% increase in new cases of H epatitis B and a 69% increase in Hepatitis C.xxii MSM have shown an increased risk of Hepatitis C infection, though in N .C. exposure has been primarily documented as injection drug use (IDU) and heterosexual contact. Those with untreated HIV have a higher risk of contracting Hepatitis C or higher rate of Hepatitis C transmission if already co - infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) estimates approximately 25% of HIV-positive individuals are co -infected with Hepatitis C and approximately 10% of new H epatitis A virus (HAV) inf ections and 15% -25% of all new H epatitis B virus (HBV) infections among adults in the United States are among MSM.xxiv 7.35.8 7.011.418.69.4 8.515.924.744.5 05101520253035404550 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015Rate per 100,000 Population NC Durham County CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 351 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Interpretations: Disparities, Gaps, Emerging Issues Stigma and Barriers to Healthcare LGBTQ + and HIV -related stigma is pervasive in the southeastern US and acts as a barrier to testing and engagement in care, contributing to a higher susceptibility to HIV/STI infections.xxiv Research has proven that consistent HIV treatment prevents HIV transmis sion. HIV -related stigma can predict lower treatment adherence thus influencing increasing rates.xxv Contributions to the prevalence of LGBTQ + and HIV -stigma include N .C.'s abstinence - emphasized sex education as well as harsh HIV/STI criminalization laws. While statewide sexual education policy changed in 2009 from a required abstinence -only until marriage curriculum to include other approaches, discussing the LGBTQ + community is not required and abstinence continues to be highly promoted in the classroom.xxvi Failing to address and discuss gender, and sexuality leaves youth without the knowledge to self -advocate and find social support and increases their vulnerability to HIV/STIs. These factors combined with racial inequity, poverty, low rates of health insurance and inability to access healthcare including uptake of PrEP allow s HIV/STIs to continue to rise, particularly in racial and ethnic minorities who face compounded discrimination and institutional barriers widely prevalent in the region.xxvii HIV/ STI Criminalization Laws Through 2017, North Carolina remain ed a state with strict HIV/STI disclosure laws and penalties should an individual not comply. Policy mandate d that HIV -positive status be disclosed to all previous and prospective sexual partners and require d the use condoms during sex. Failure to comply could result in a misdemeanor charge and up to 2 years of incarceration. Individuals with known STIs, Hepatitis B and C are still subject to similar regulations. Under previous N.C. policy, isolation and quarantine are also permissible should statewide public health officials deem an individual a threat to public health.xxviii Such antiquated laws fail to take into consideration scientific breakthroughs in anti -retroviral therapy which prevent HIV transmission if the virus is suppressed and the use of PrEP by an HIV - negative partner. This type of public policy reinforces HIV -related stigma by cosigning HIV - positive individuals as potential criminals, invokes fear, and prevents individuals from seeking out testing and potential treatment.xxix Though the state's HIV control measures have recently been modernized in light of medical advances and do not require disclosure or use of condoms should an individual's HIV be virally suppressed for a minimum of 6 months, their partner is also HIV - positive, or if their partner is taking PrEP, it will take time to undo the impact of stigmatizi ng legislation upon the community at large.xxx CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 352 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Mental Health and Substance Use The LGBTQ + community experience higher rates of substance abuse and mental health issues compared to the heterosexual community. IDU is an efficient mode of HIV/hepatitis transmission and the intersection of mental health issues and rising substance use further pred ispose the LGBTQ + community to these viruses.xxxi, xxxii, xxxiii Increased rates of hepatitis seen in N .C. have been largely attributed to IDU and the LGBTQ + community may be especially vulnerable. Documentation of Sexuality and Gender The transgender, lesbian, and bisexual community often fail to be identified as sub -categories related to HIV/STI exposure and are presumably lumped under 'men who have sex with men,' 'heterosexual -all' or 'other risks,' listed in N.C. reports and all of which completely erase the gender and sexual identity of these individuals. Due to inaccurate documentation of gender identity, the HIV rates in the transgender community are most likely greatly underreported. In 2014, the latest available data from North Carolina Departme nt of Health and Human Services (NC DHHS ) in regards to the transgender community, transgender individuals accounted for only 0.03% of all HIV tests performed by the state. HIV rates in the transgender community are only documented if they are receiving fe deral and/or state financial assistance and therefore do not accurately portray incidence in the community.xxxiv STI rates according to gender were limited to men and women and did not explicitly address transgender individuals. Testing events reported to the CDC in 2013 found the new HIV diagnosis rate in transgender women to be more than 3 times the national average. Of the transgender women diagnosed with HIV from 2009 -2014, 51% were Black and 29% Latina, again demonstrating th e disproportionate burden of HIV on racial and ethnic minorities.xxxv Of note, the 2016 North Carolina HIV/STD/Hepatitis Surveillance Report does not address nor mention the transgender, lesbian, or bisexual community, indicating a large portion of the LGB TQ+ community left out of vital conversation and services. Women and HIV/STIs Though women who have sex with women may represent a smaller portion of HIV/STI rates in comparison to MSM, research has demonstrated an increasing need to include women of v arious sexualities in STI interventions and screenings, particularly as bisexual women have an elevated STI risk in contrast to heterosexual women.xxxvi Healthcare providers who fail to address sexual behaviors, genders of sexual partners, gender identity, and make assumptions about HIV/STI risk based on gender could be creating false notions of safety in regards to risk and/or providing an inaccurate representation of the prevalence of HIV/STIs in these communities. Consequences of such actions include fai lure to receive proper treatment and HIV/STI intervention strategies not effectively targeting affected communities. CHAPTER 14 LGBTQ+ Issues 353 | 2017 Durham County Community Health Assessment Recommended Strategies NC's Integrated HIV P revention and Care Plan 2017 -2017 provides valuable information around needs, gaps, and areas of improvement. The strategy timeline should be followed. Improved collection of sexual orientation and gender identity in HIV/STI testing and treatment forms Increased routine broad screening of HIV/STIs/Hepatitis in primary care practices and urgent care/emergency room settings Continuing collaborative work between the LGBTQ + community, harm reduction, and mental health coalitions Racial, cultural, and language conscious outreach and care programs for Black and Latinx communities in regards to sexua l health Actively address social services needs of the community - housing, transportation, healthcare access, mental health services, substance use treatment - as they are predisposing factors to HIV/STI infection and barriers to testing and treatment Current Initiatives & Activities Partnership for a Healthy Durham A coalition of local organizations and community members with the goal of collaboratively improving the physical, mental, and social health and well -being of Durham's residents.

Prior to developing the survey, presentations were given at two Partners against Crime (PAC) meetings in Durham County to gain insight and feedback on the types of questions and information community members would be most interested in learning through the CHA process. A surveymonkey link was also sent to members of the Partnership for a Healthy Durham to find out what information was most useful in the last CHA report and what topics would be most relevant to work being done in Durham County go ing forward. A large group of community organizations was also engaged through email and phone conversations regarding upcoming organizational survey needs. Feedback from the PACs , Partnership for a Healthy Durham, and community organizations informed the creation of a draft survey, which was then recirculated for feedback and comments. The following organizations were included in this process: Alliance Behavioral Healthcare, the Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Commission (BPAC), Duke Division of Community Health, Durham Congregations in Action, Durham Parks and Recreation, Durham's Partnership for Children, El Centro Hispano, El Futuro, Inter Denominational Ministerial Alliance of Durham and Vicinity, Inter -neighborhood Council, LGBTQ Center of Durham, Nei ghborhood Improvement Services, Partners against Crime, and SHIFT NC. Sampling Methods The Durham County Department of Public Health collaborated with the North Carolina Institute for Public Health (NCIPH) to draw samples for the survey. A two -stage clust er sampling methodology was used, which involves randomly selecting census blocks and a set of random interview starting points within the selected census blocks. Census blocks were selected with probability proportionate to population size, giving census blocks with the highest populations a greater chance of being selected. Two -stage cluster sampling was used to select both a full county sample, in which any census block in Durham County was eligible to be selected into the sample, and a high proportion Hispanic and Latino sample. In order to be eligible for inclusion in the Hispanic and Latino sample, at least 50% of residents living in the census block must have been Hispanic or Latino. Data on population size and ethnicity were obtained from the 2010 C ensus. Thirty five census blocks and 245 households were selected to participate in the full county sample, while 20 census blocks and 210 households were selected for the high proportion Hispanic and Latino sample. Maps for both samples are displayed belo w. 2016 Durham County Health Opinion Survey results 2 Full county sample High proportion Hispanic and Latino sample 2016 Durham County Health Opinion Survey results 3 Survey Administration Volunteers were recruited from community organizations and universities in the Triangle to help administer the surveys for the full county and Hispanic and Latino samples. Prior to administering the surveys, two training sessions were held to prepare volun teers. The training included survey best practices, safety, cultural sensitivity, and a hands on component to familiarize the volunteers with the technology used to collect survey responses. Seventy three volunteers assisted with the full county sample ov er the course of 11 survey days and 29 volunteers helped with the Hispanic and Latino sample over the course of eight days. The surveys for both samples were administered between October 6, 2016 and November 15, 2016. Survey teams were sent out in teams o f two and were instructed to begin at the randomly selected starting points. If no one answered the door or the survey was refused, volunteers were instructed to go to the next closest residence. This process continued until a survey was completed. Then, v olunteers continued to the next randomly selected start point. Eligibility Criteria In order to be eligible to participate in the survey, three criteria must have been met: 1) residents must have been 18 years or older; 2) residents must have lived in the selected house; and 3) residents must have been willing to take the survey. Data analysis and Results Analysis was completed in SAS 9.4. Results were weighted to account for the sampling method to ensure that final results are generalizable to the sample p opulation. The CDC CASPER methodology was used to calculate sample weights. The methodology incorporates the total number of households in the sampling frame, the number of households in the census block, and the number of interviews collected in each cens us block. Weights were also used to calculate standard error for each proportion. Confidence intervals are calculated using the standard errors and should be used when interpreting the data. Confidence intervals represent intervals that contain the true v alue in 95% of repeated samples. There are 200 completed surveys included in the full county sample and 158 completed surveys in the Hispanic and Latino sample. The re sponse rates rate were 54.1% an d 68 .7% in the full county and Hispanic and Latino samples, respectively. Since the Hispanic and Latino sample was selected among neighborhoods with at least 50% or more Hispanic and Latino residents, the results can only be extrapolated to Hispanics and Latinos living in neighborhoods with high proportions of Hispanics and Lati nos. The results cannot be generalized to all Hispanics and Latinos living in Durham County.

Fewer guns.2/16/2018 9:40 AM 96 More education on how to access complicated mental health system, starting with EDs and triage with county health educators and social workers, not just hospital employees. More restrictive laws and policies on the explosion of development happening in Durham, rewquire more affordable units and increase fees and taxes on developers if they are not building affordable units.2/16/2018 8:14 AM 97 Affordable housing set asides tied to new development / rezoning permits. Increase funds for community health centers and diversify target audiences for greater funding stability. Cops out of cars, have DPD have walk/bike patrols to get to know neighbors and increase trust2/16/2018 7:45 AM 98 Equal access to healthcare for everyone. A requirement for the developers who are building all these giant apartment blocks to include affordable housing. Much more investment in pre-college education, i.e. raising pay levels for teachers and subsidizing school supplies and free meals for disadvantaged kids.2/15/2018 11:50 PM 99 You're kidding. 2/15/2018 11:28 PM 100 Insure that any study groups for any of these Issues has a direct line to City Council & Co. Commissioners re: critical findings for their information or action. Study groups should always include a cross-section of the city, wherever possible. Action plans and subsequent results should be publicized in the broadest possible way.2/15/2018 11:20 PM 101 -consider \"tiny homes\" model for transitional housing to get people sheltered immediately. -work with Durham Habitat for Humanity to quickly expand affordable housing, including supporting their home repairs program -strengthen/create work programs with the city/county for individuals with criminal backgrounds; also provide incentives/grants to work programs with proven track record, like TROSA -desegregate our public schools -mixed-income housing -universal Pre-K for all residents (start with 4-year olds, eventually expand to 3-year olds), free bus transportation should be included so that all families can participate regardless of ability to transport children to Pre-K programs -expand access to mental health services, increase case manager positions to lighten case loads -partner with Durham Public Schools to facilitate the \"Community Schools\" model as a way of connecting families to resources and services with the schools as a delivery point -full-time nurses in every school -continue to support community policing models, work towards use of \"restorative justice\" framework -decriminalize drug use, esp. marijuana -consider universal basic income -incentivize businesses to offer discounts to folks using SNAP, help connect these businesses and customers -consult with the new Poor People's Campaign for strategies to alleviate and end poverty in Durham -make all public transit free -provide protections to our undocumented residents so they are not forced to hide in the shadows, esp. if they have children2/15/2018 11:13 PM 102 Providing nutritious options that are affordable in neighborhoods that have only fast food options.

Legalizing marijuana. 2/15/2018 9:28 PM 105 labeled GMO foods and access to garden areas 2/15/2018 9:13 PM 106 More information available on senior services. 2/15/2018 9:01 PM 8 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey107 Healthcare is more of a national issue, but having health care mobile units to go into neighborhoods where people lack transportation or information or access otherwise would be great. Also, requiring new developers to include a percentage of there space to be affordable...not sure if that's doable, but it would be nice.2/15/2018 8:47 PM 108 Affordable housing: public/private partnerships. Relations between community and police: conversations, conversations, more conversations. N'hood policing rather than response-to-calls only. Mental Health and Substance Abuse: More government funding, and also private donations to public programs.2/15/2018 8:41 PM 109 Follow the lead of cities that have experimented with giving homeless people no-strings-attached housing, or jobs, or both. Find a way to do the same thing for healthcare - then expand from there. Pilot interventions to specifically counteract the disparities Black patients encounter in the health care system. Require potential police officers to spend a year in a (full-time, paid) community service role in the community they would be working in before they can be hired as an officer.2/15/2018 8:04 PM 110 Small quality grocery stores within 10 blocks of all neighborhoods. Holistic healing with herbs and medicinal plants taught for free at community center.2/15/2018 7:38 PM 111 1) affordable housing: linked development 2)community relationships with police: implicit & explicit bias training with police; make efforts to decrease racial profiling; offer incentives for police to live in the communities where they serve 3)discrimination and racism: decrease segregation in the schools (stop increasing the number of charter schools); implement anti-racism training for city & county employees DPS teachers2/15/2018 7:19 PM 112 Provide more mental health and substance abuse interventions aimed at those in poverty. 2/15/2018 5:15 PM 113 Health insurance: Not sure on this one, maybe a city-wide insurance plan for literally everyone? Affordable Housing: All new multi-unit constructions MUST contain at least 10% low income units mixed in (not ghettoized) Police: Pay police more, so we can expect more. Cameras must be worn and ON at all times. Obvious cases of turning off cameras or sound to hide things are punishable criminally and write-ups. There really should never be a time to turn off the sound or camera except in a bathroom. Otherwise it should be considered proof of guilt. Mental Health: Must have more access for treatment and homeless shelters AND programs to help people change their circumstances!! Poverty: Similar to mental health. Programs to help people change their circumstances. Housing. Training. Help!2/15/2018 4:51 PM 114 No idea 2/15/2018 4:44 PM 115 Increase minimum wage; we should not allow homeless people to camp on city property. This is a major issue.2/15/2018 4:40 PM 116 financial incentives for industry to address these issues; training and awareness across sectors; advocacy with policy makers2/15/2018 4:13 PM 117 together 2/15/2018 4:00 PM 118 Money, expertise, prioritizing, and motivation for community and city government to solve them. 2/15/2018 3:26 PM 119 Continued focus on access to services and opportunities for Durham residents. 2/15/2018 3:11 PM 120 Cash transfers. 2/15/2018 3:02 PM 121 m 2/15/2018 2:23 PM 122 More access to services in the projects. 2/15/2018 2:12 PM 123 Socialized healthcare, gun buyback and reform laws, increased funding to public schools, progessive educational reform, legalization of marijuana, enforcement of anti-discrimination laws2/15/2018 2:08 PM 124 Public health approach, prevention 2/15/2018 1:49 PM 125 Require all new development to include 20% affordable housing. All. Everywhere. Apartments, condos, subdivisions. No more luxury-only development. By affordable--a teacher, cop, clerical staff at Duke, Durham Co entry social worker or EMT should be able to afford the rent/mortgage. City/county should set aside funds to assist with down payment. Loans to be repaid at sale or starting 3-5 years after purchase.2/15/2018 1:30 PM 9 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey126 Universal public health insurance (Medicare for All) with comprehensive mental health coverage; universal basic income; free school lunches for all. In the absence of federal programs, we need to have strong and inventive local initiatives to protect and strengthen the health of our city/county. We have too many half measures, outsourced to charities and nonprofits -- this needs to be public and universal.2/15/2018 1:26 PM 127 Rent control on residential and commercial properties. Pass a law prohibiting the use of \"smart\" electric meters in Durham. Pass a law mandating no Wi-fi in hospitals, schools, daycare centers, and public buildings such as the courthouse.2/15/2018 1:03 PM 128 I have no idea 2/15/2018 12:59 PM 129 I wish I knew...my sense is that governmental agencies and local organizations need to partner WITH private entities to address these issues holistically. I know that you are working with many groups but I wonder if you could hidden the partnership..or maybe you already have.2/15/2018 12:21 PM 130 Affordable housing needs to be a priority of the mayor and city council. Instead of selling downtown to whoever is buying, and driving housing prices through the roof. We are going the way of Seattle, Portland, and Austin, with no one seeming to put the brakes on it. Insecure housing goes hand in hand with poverty, hunger, and unemployment. The government needs to invest in affordable housing, and make that a requirement of future development in and around downtown.2/15/2018 11:55 AM 131 City/County partnerships with private sector on building affordable housing that has mixed economic renters - some market rental, some subsidized. We need mixed use development downtown. City permitting for private development should REQUIRE 25% subsidized rental availability. 2. Small HC clinics sprinkled throughout the city/county, allowing for easy access and cheaper care. 3. City partnership with Durham Food Coop to bring fresh foods to our food ghetto areas.2/15/2018 10:36 AM 132 I'm not sure how to fix, but poverty is at the top of the list and that has a waterfall effect on the other areas - housing, food access,etc... I also think structural racism is a serious issue that needs to be addressed head on. I would like to see all elected officials be required to undergo a 2 day race equity training. I would think a similar effort to do that work for county/city employees should also be an aspirational goal. I also believe that community/police relations are an area which has an impact on the community but especially in communities of color where there are issues with inequity in jail policy and procedures and in policy/procedures in dealing with agencies like ICE.2/15/2018 10:33 AM 133 I really don't have any answers to resolve these issues. 2/15/2018 10:32 AM 134 Durham should first and foremost stop subsidizing luxury apartment/condo buildings. The city should do what it can to stop investors who live across the county and the world from coming in and buying up properties with cash and sitting on them or remodeling them and flipping them for a profit. There should be more protections for renters. We need to raise the minimum wage. All these rights for Durham to do as a municipality come from the state legislature.2/15/2018 10:20 AM 135 Durham needs to consider adopting a similar program to Orange County Housing Land Trust that has certain housing units open for purchase to families that fall in certain income guidelines. People own the property, but when it is time to sell it cannot be sold at more than a higher percentage of what the purchase price was and it goes back into the housing trust pool. Durham's housing is getting to crisis levels and it seems not enough is being done.2/15/2018 10:14 AM 136 I believe affordable housing is the most pressing issue we face in Durham. I don't have a solution but I feel this issue needs to be addressed immediately and with all resources available. Durham should be accessible to all its residents.2/15/2018 10:09 AM 10 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey137 To help with affordable housing first the city needs to stop building all the high income homes in areas and start building homes for people who don't have incomes over 35K. Southside project was supposed to be affordable homes for people with lower income but ended up being homes for mainly white folks who worked and could afford 200-300K homes. That is not affordable for the people subjected to poverty every day. The city should stop building homes to make money for upper white people and start building housing for homeless people. For example look at all the new high rise buildings downtown. They city may not be the ones who purchase the sites but they can put a cap on how many are built and the price of them. They can prevent developers from building so many apartments and condos for a projected arrival of residents. There are a lot of homeless people already living around the city on the streets with no where to live. They have mental issues and no resources. No one is looking out for them. Put together a team of people, get in a vehicle and drive around various parts of the city. Go out to 15/501 and see all the homeless people living out there. Take some of the vacant commercial buildings around the city and turn them into housing for the homeless. You can drive down 15/501 and look at all the unleased vacant commercial buildings. They could house so many people. The housing department have so many rules and policies they make it hard for landlords to even rent to Section 8 families. They ask landlords to offer housing yet make every step impossible for the landlord so what happens is the landlords move on to post and rent to people who don't have to go through so many hoops in the system just to have a place to live. I know from having experienced trying to rent to Section 8. The system is set to put up road blocks in every process with the tenant and landlord. The community views the relations with the police department as strained because there is too much violence with the police and community. It is obvious politics are involved and years ago there used to be police driving by neighborhoods making a presence. Now they only come if called and not so quick to help with minority neighborhoods. Not as many officers are on the force and that is because of their system within. It starts with the direction of the police chief. Can't build relations with the community when the community sees discrimination and racism from the police around the world.2/15/2018 10:03 AM 138 Increase access to affordable housing by prioritizing construction of affordable housing developments. Partner with local grocery stores and other produce vendors to build grocery stores near affordable housing developments. Work with public transit agencies to ensure housing developments and nearby grocery stores are serviced by public transit. Collaborate with the people living in affordable housing developments to map their assets and challenges and develop a community strategy for ongoing improvement. Invest in businesses owned by people of color.2/15/2018 9:53 AM 139 Educate the public, enlist older adults in the effort, get organizations to work together 2/15/2018 8:52 AM 140 Have police training focus more on community awareness and assessing situations in a calm manner.2/15/2018 6:32 AM 141 Provide healthcare, mental or otherwise, affordable and available to everyone, regardless of medical insurance. Share information with communities in need of healthcare about available programs and services. Get suggestions directly from these groups about services they need or want.2/15/2018 1:14 AM 142 I have none to share presently, need to think about this 2/15/2018 12:38 AM 143 Better funding for mental health treatment, better advertising of mental health treatment programs, teaching children in schools the importance of good mental health care, more school nurses, programs to refurbish homes and turn into low-rent housing, work with Duke Med to develop opioid addiction programs,2/15/2018 12:01 AM 144 I wish I knew. Electing representatives who actually care about their constituents might be a good start.2/14/2018 10:20 PM 145 fix the bus station bathroom--clean and supply and expand and modernize it 2/14/2018 9:35 PM 146 I do not know. 2/14/2018 9:26 PM 147 Nothing to suggest; these are tough issues. 2/14/2018 9:24 PM 148 Making people aware of programs available to help. 2/14/2018 8:29 PM 149 Continuous Dialogue with community members who are impacted significantly with these issues as well as government members who can listen and understand to develop a coordinated efffort seek solution.2/14/2018 8:23 PM 150 I wish I knew. 2/14/2018 8:00 PM 11 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey151 - implement zoning policy changes for mixed-income housing that do not expire in a short amount of time - make Durham walkable- add sidewalks all over that connect to transportation, grocery stores, parks & recreation - address the institutions that run Durham, and evaluate if they propel, are neutral, or take backwards steps to impact health and wealth disparities; create a plan (in partnership with policy leaders) to address systemic & institutional structures that do not actively reduce known disparities2/14/2018 7:36 PM 152 Developers must pay a decent percentage of all costs of building/renovating schools when new communities are planned. City and county government must put it's citizens first. An excellent education is vital to our future, impacts crime, poverty and promotes a desire to make our communities a better place to live. Teachers must be valued with community and administrative support. This includes a budget that will pay for text books, classroom supplies. Put our school tax money where it should be going, our children. Affordable housing is a basic need. Affordable health care and affordable housing are key to the health of any community. I wish I did have a solution.2/14/2018 7:02 PM 153 Expand NC Medicaid, increase property taxes to support poverty mitigation and build mixed- income housing2/14/2018 5:10 PM 154 (I write surveys for a living - and just saying, you need to divide this question out across the 5 topic areas.) 1. Affordable housing - enforce and strengthen codes that require a % of affordable housing in new builds. Retain % affordable housing stock in neighborhoods bordering downtown. I think affordable and more extensive transportation options also falls in this category.2/14/2018 4:56 PM 155 Oh man, if I had this answer readily available, I would be famous and you would be out of a job 2/14/2018 4:35 PM 156 universal health care 2/14/2018 4:21 PM 157 Health seminars for the health & mental health issues, seminars on community relationships with police.2/14/2018 4:18 PM 158 Visible police presence around downtown apartments and businesses.

Mixed use developments that aren't all luxury apts/condos2/14/2018 4:16 PM 159 Individual education and contact by trained professions, churches and caring persons in the community. Elect government officials whose agenda is taking care of people not increasing their wealth and boosting their egos. Provide decent paying jobs so people can afford decent housing and health care. Stop ignoring the problems.2/14/2018 3:47 PM 160 We need to do more to ensure that children are not exposed to trauma, and to ensure that those who are receive services to minimize the impact. Part of that is to be sure that we decrease the number of evictions in Durham County. There are many programs that are working to end gun violence, decrease evictions, provide affordable housing and healthcare, and support families, but they need more funding. We also need to directly empower communities that are dealing with these issues rather than just treating them like victims.2/14/2018 3:34 PM 161 I sure do hope that the people I voted for takes issue on these topics, because they said they were concerned. They need to act on it.2/14/2018 3:23 PM 162 Not sure 2/14/2018 2:33 PM 163 Need to involve the people that are affected and not just leaders of the community. 2/14/2018 2:28 PM 164 Creative methods of additional means of transportation over and across the city 2/14/2018 2:18 PM 165 I know nothing about Durham's budget, but much of problem solving is about money. I have no bright ideas.2/14/2018 2:02 PM 166 Local governments should be able to force developers to \"set aside\" a small percentage of houses/apartments for affordable housing for seniors and other lower income residents Re: poverty - the South MUST begin to pay livable wages. There are too many people here whose primary job/income will not support them and they have 2 and 3 other jobs.2/14/2018 1:11 PM 167 There should be county initiatives for builders and developers to build affordable/moderate income housing.2/14/2018 12:32 PM 168 community events that build relationships with police, increase in wages 2/14/2018 12:28 PM 169 Electing more conservatives to local government and not progressives. 2/14/2018 12:24 PM 170 I haven't the vaguest idea. 12:14 PM 12 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey171 A senior day (with specified tables for socializing), at least once a month, at restaurants outside of the center.2/14/2018 12:14 PM 172 Dementia Inclusive Durham - education, partnership with community organizations to foster well- being in adults with dementia2/14/2018 12:09 PM 173 Affordable health care, housing, and transportation 2/14/2018 12:01 PM 174 Access to affordable education; public schools decipline structure not set-up like penal institution. Early food education and access to nutritious foods2/14/2018 11:34 AM 175 More focus on addressing poverty and other social determinants of health. Mission to increase physical activity.2/14/2018 11:33 AM 176 Better informed. 2/14/2018 11:17 AM 177 I think that there could either be a couple of days a month that Durham citizens along with the City of Durham employees have a clean up day or members of our own neighborhoods form a group to clean up our neighborhood. I think a clean Durham will go a long way in improving our mental health and our outlook o our city. I also think that this will help ncourage others who may be thinking of moving to Durham.2/14/2018 11:08 AM 178 There is so much over the top violence in this city - more than I have EVER seen anywhere. Just last week I, along with 2 coworkers, were crossing the street in the crosswalk - no cars were coming when we started to cross. A car had turned the corner and accelerated to speed up as if to hit us. There was no reason for this type of action. She eventually slowed up only to speed back up as soon we had cleared a small enough path for her truck to get by. This is just sad. And so much racism. For example, when DSS new director was introduced, he was introduced as Ben Rose. When the new county manager for Wake was introduced, he was introduced through WRAL as the African-American, David Ellis etc. I know it's not Durham, but the point remains regardless of county. I definitely won't stereotype, this is just the type of citizens I see and hear. Durham has so much to offer and it seems to be brought down by their own citizens through rage, fear and violence. Life is meant to be lived fully and shared respectfully/lovingly. I don't have solutions; however, I know a great change is happening and I'm hoping the positivity will spread and be shared with much more peace and harmony.2/14/2018 10:58 AM 179 It would be nice if we quit reacting to floridly mentally ill citizens with aggressive or lethal police action. It's not appropriate to arrest people in the middle of psychosis, or shoot suicidal people.2/14/2018 10:51 AM 180 Please plant more trees in downtown Durham.

I guess a serious PR campaign, educating people to be tested for diabetes, for instance, would be a start. Hold classes on how to cook healthy food, even if someone is on food stamps. Grade school curriculum should include programs teaching healthy eating so kids could take the messages home. Some states are instituting some kind of a medicaid program that's not federally funded. Don't know details and don't know if that's an option for Durham. I wish there was a law that would require developers to set aside a portion of their apartments to low and middle income people. I'm proud of Durham for working on this with the homeowner tax increase. We need to do more, if possible, so cops and nurses and teachers and a whole bunch of other people can afford to live here. I want Durham to welcome people with different income levels. Not just the McMansion builders. Individuals suffering from mental illness are at risk on many levels: they often wind up in jail, are not diagnosed, are excluded from society. Keep up support of the CIT training for police and sheriffs. LOBBY RALEIGH TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR COURTS AND JUDGES. Re: Larceny: police are constrained because of the budget. I don't know how to fix that without raising taxes. I feel that the quality of my life in Durham is diminished just knowing about the amount of criminal activity that exists here. I don't blame the police; they are doing a terrific job. It's an intractable problem. I'm glad the police give the community good ideas for making our homes less desirable for thieves. I commend the people who work on the budget; to make it work so that everything that needs to be covered is taken care of. We all have to acknowledge the tradeoffs that have to be part of the process. Keep engaging the community to be active participants in helping Durham to be a good place to live. I'm very disappointed that attendance in the PAC3 meeting that I got to is very low. I wish more people to be engaged.2/13/2018 2:46 PM 221 Durham should look at the rising cost of living and also hourly rate of pay and standards of wrong for those who make less money.

The local hospitals could also help by working with patients who come in with substance abuse or mental health issues besides just checking their vitals and sending them home. Its frankly embarrassing the level of care offered compared to some other countries especially to know that the average life expectancy of an American recently declined because of the massive increase of mental health/substance abuse deaths. Crime - Crime in the city is ramp-pet as I'm sure you're aware. There are shooting after shooting in very public places that frankly happen way too often. More opportunists for youth may help reduce those interested in crime.2/9/2018 12:23 PM 273 Transportation should be available to all elderly.

Make it easier for people to locate quality mental health service providers that are experienced in serving/healing issues most relevant to a consumer. Provide incentives for mental health providers to offer services at an accessible price, location, and modality (phone, web, etc.). Incentivize employers to pay living wages, comprehensive benefits, and hiring locally. Create training programs for local employers to identify talent in the local community and incentivize them hiring people who need an entry level position to start their career. Too many jobs require people to have experience but do not offer opportunities for people to gain experience on the job or through other paid training mechanisms. Lower the price of housing. Do not allow developers and landlords to build, sell, or rent homes that are higher than 1/3 of minimum wage or a living wage. Incentivize more lower rent landlords and provide resources and services for regular maintenance of homes and property (job creation, skills training, materials and labor grants for repairs and improvements). Provide effective substance abuse programs that are affordable, accessible, and offers different modes (in-pateint, outpatient, phone, web, etc.) Incentivize more trained professionals to enter the field of substance abuse treatment, management, and operations. Require high quality standards and competitive pay as well as comprehensive ethical standards for substance abuse prevention and treatment agencies. Help people in recovery to gain the skills and structure needed to maintain their sobriety by helping them enter and maintain homes and social communities that are drug free or different than what they came from. Stop sending people to jail or prison for substance abuse issues. Treat them first for substance abuse and then for mental health, provide them jobs, so that they can earn enough to support a home and drug free lifestyle. Provide more recreation and activities in impoverished neighborhoods, not just for the kids for parents and elderly too. People get bored and depressed and do drugs out of apathy2/8/2018 3:15 PM 301 My focus is on food security and safe spaces for being active for Durham residents of all ages, race, socioeconomic status, gender...

Habitat and Self-Help are doing good work and provide a good model. We need to make every effort to keep all of the inner city from becoming unaffordable to the people who live there now. All this fancy new housing is great, but NOT if it drives out the folks already in Durham.

Education needs to be stressed. Parents who don't encourage their childrens education need to be punished. The glorifying of violence needs to be stopped, blaming the police for peoples choices will never fix anything. ACA needs to be repealed so people can afford insurance again. I've lived in DU 9 years, my health insurance premiums have doubled and my coverage is down. People with chronic issues suchas diabetes and obesity need to follow their Dr's orders on diet and exercise or lose access to health care. One of my friends is a nurse, she tells me all the time how obese people come in and tell her how well their following their diets and exercise plan, yet they've somehow gained another 10lbs in 3 months2/7/2018 10:32 PM 331 Establish farmers markets in underprivileged areas Create safe zones for substance abuse use, incorporating counseling and methods for getting clean2/7/2018 10:28 PM 332 More community involvement 2/7/2018 9:53 PM 333 Establish need, assess resource availability, develop action plan, implement 2/7/2018 9:03 PM 334 Higher minimum wages, mobile care options that can come to those who cannot usually access services, and a plan that involves government, private business, and individuals in the community is key! Involve the populations in need in the discussions so that there is investment and buy-in at the lowest AND highest levels.2/7/2018 8:31 PM 335 community partnerships and conversations. Financial giving to programs. 2/7/2018 8:23 PM 336 Are you kidding? There is not enough room in a small box to convey such ideas. Our own government can't even solve that problem. For starters, how about taking some money away from our legislators and giving it to teachers instead? How about hiring school nurses so there are enough to cover the schools instead of one nurse covering 4 schools? How about harm reduction programs instead of punitive programs for substance abuse? As for affordable health care, well, good luck with that.2/7/2018 3:46 PM 337 More funding for outreach events on health related topics. Free clinics on transportation lines. Community gardens IN communities, and people to help the community to keep them going.2/7/2018 3:14 PM 338 1. Creating more opportunities for employment. Require city-funded vendors who are revitalizing neighborhoods to hire those living in the neighborhoods. Incentivize private vendors to do the same. For example, private builders may receive incentives for hiring construction workers from the community. 2. We need to really lobby for expanded healthcare services. With Roy Moore as the governor and midterm elections coming up this should be a top priority. We need to make it a campaign issue. 3. The city is doing a good job of trying to ensure affordable housing. One solution could be to incentivize landlords to keep up their rentals and to continue to build mixed income housing in areas close to downtown (and close to the resources that people need).2/7/2018 2:32 PM 20 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey339 Pass a higher minimum wage in the county. Offer free mental health services and greatly expanded pediatric mental health \"beds\" at local hospitals.2/7/2018 1:50 PM 340 More funding for mental health/family health programs, more integration of programs because all of these issues are interconnected and affect the others, more accountability and STAFF (especially bilingual staff) for the government entities that hold the monies for these issues (DSS, DPS, DJJ, etc.)2/7/2018 1:28 PM 341 Engage community members and existing coalitions working to address these issues. Have impacted people at the table for conversations/decisions that concern them.2/7/2018 1:19 PM 342 Focus on community outreach and prioritization of marginalized peoples 2/7/2018 1:14 PM 343 Free mental health services for pregnant women 2/7/2018 11:46 AM 344 Affordable housing- need policies that require affordable housing to be created in conjunction with these luxury/expensive apartment complexes being built. Policing- policing law enforcement needs to work with people in the community to come up with solutions together, not top down.2/7/2018 11:30 AM 345 I do believe people should be educated, but not just stop with their education after high school or college. Also study even after that so that one can be more informed on how to help others, to be a better person than you were yesterday in order to learn how to help other. Self-esteem is a big factor in someone's life. If one doesn't love themselves, how are they expected to love, care, and watch over another. I feel like this is something society should research more about. Bringing one another self-esteem up in order to help others do better as well!!2/7/2018 11:03 AM 346 ? 2/7/2018 9:52 AM 347 I'll need to get back with you on that 2/6/2018 5:53 PM 348 Invest in research and policy development; engage the community in developing solutions that will work and be sustainable; provide safe, healthy spaces for people with fewer resources to spend time and improve their quality of life; develop programs that involve retired people who are motivated, knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and compassionate and give then a chance to give back to their community2/6/2018 12:51 PM 349 More awarness would be better. Along with more things for oeipke with low income families 2/6/2018 11:25 AM 350 Talking to the community 2/6/2018 11:22 AM 351 Give me the knowledge of the importance of freedom; Byou which it stands me in the Frontline to be free by the audacity oof hope free at last.2/6/2018 11:19 AM 352 don't have any 2/6/2018 11:19 AM 353 Universal healthcare 2/6/2018 11:19 AM 354 Help each other out to prevent all this 2/6/2018 11:19 AM 355 Build community centers, get better knowledge of what goes on in more urban neighborhoods. 2/6/2018 11:18 AM 356 Looking for better 2/6/2018 11:18 AM 357 I don't know how to solve these issue's. 2/6/2018 11:17 AM 358 CanI dates that will commit 2/6/2018 11:17 AM 359 Use better research and have people help with theses crimes that happening 2/6/2018 11:16 AM 360 Education 2/6/2018 11:16 AM 361 More funding for mental health and substance abuse 2/6/2018 11:16 AM 362 Meow 2/6/2018 11:16 AM 11:15 AM 364 Community collaboration 2/6/2018 10:52 AM 365 More money from government 2/6/2018 10:48 AM 366 Unsure 2/6/2018 7:57 AM 21 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey367 Until healthy food is more affordable than fast food and junk food, we are unlikely to be able to significantly affect the issues of obesity, diabetes, and food access. As regards substance use, I think there is a tie-in with the violent crime issue; the courts need to mandate participation in substance abuse programs and the jails/prisons need to stress this as well.2/5/2018 2:07 PM 368 City/County decision makers and law enforcement should be required to engage in anti-racism training and *ongoing* work. Data should be collected/assessed and shared widely about how policies and practices are disproportionately impacting people of color in Durham (and across the country). Policies/practices should be examined and revised to help reduce these disparities. Elevate this conversation through frequent forums, presentations, campaigns, etc-- the narrative must be changed, and implicit biases must be confronted and deconstructed. Engage youth in the conversation as true partners.2/5/2018 11:17 AM 369 This is your job. 2/4/2018 9:39 PM 370 Access to opportunities for disadvantaged groups will help bring better outcomes. Mental health services are needed as more people experience duress on account of struggles with finding housing, jobs, and adequate care.2/4/2018 9:10 AM 371 Inform the survivors for self advocacy, help with access to skilled services to treat the impairments, understand the impact on activities of daily living.2/3/2018 8:33 PM 372 Increase access to public resources and provide more options for safe housing as well as affordable daycare. We need better access to healthcare including continued support for Lincoln.2/3/2018 7:51 PM 373 More programs and partnerships to address these issues. Look for out of the box solutions 2/3/2018 6:53 PM 374 Job training to help people get better paying jobs, and keep bringing more jobs into the area. Also, public transport to the jobs. Increase the % of affordable housing per new housing, and integrate the two. Community gardens, edible landscaping, encourage converting lawns to gardens, and continue putting more sidewalks and greenways/parks in the county.2/3/2018 6:33 PM 375 Communicate more with community activists and local government officials 2/3/2018 4:35 PM 376 create innovative housing options using sturdy, recyclable materials (i.e. train cars, portable steel storage units), require quality, consistent, regular interval mental health treatment for all detainees who will, one day be released into population, create deliberate and innovative neighborhood based employment/entrepreneurial wealth opportunities, increase the number of community health workers serving residents with chronic illnesses, including mental health.2/3/2018 2:58 PM 377 The primary issue on which I believe Durham can have an impact is affordable housing. Increase the % affordable units that developers must provide and enforce the requirements.2/3/2018 2:03 PM 378 Access: Partner with Duke University/Hospital Systems to create a County-Wide Insurance pool for the uninsured and those currently purchasing their won insurance. A pool of Duke's nearly 40, 000 employees plus another 40, 000 from the county would have a fair amount of bargaining power. A levee of 3 mils would allow the \"buy in\" to access insurance would allow for a sliding scale. Other large employees in the area may consider joining the pool.2/3/2018 11:02 AM 379 More funding to health dept. More education to the public about diet, walking, etc., 2/3/2018 10:02 AM 380 Meaningful communication between the community and city officials/city employees to establish a plan of action to address community concerns.2/3/2018 9:33 AM 381 Increase substance abuse prevention initiatives, ex.more pro-social activities for lower socio- economic youth, partner with universities, law enforcement and local business for funding. Look for examples of how other cities have tackled housing and homelessness (little houses in Portland). All law enforcement officers to be trained in CIT and know how to address mental illness. Law enforcment to be a portal for access to mental health and SA treatment.2/3/2018 6:59 AM 382 Public-private partnerships to develop affordable housing units on city and county-owned property. Continued opportunities for anti-racism training for public officials to better understand the systemic background of racism so that they will make informed policy decisions. Improved national healthcare policy, such as single-payer health insurance. Living wage policies.2/2/2018 8:52 PM 383 Haven't given it a lot of thought. Sugar tax, healthy meals and recess time in schools, expansion of national healthcare, drug treatment programs for drug offenders.2/2/2018 6:19 PM 384 Access to care 2/2/2018 4:49 PM / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey385 incentivize affordable housing; raise taxes to increase stock of affordable housing and emergency housing; better information/education about more affordable health care (e.g., urgent care vs. emergency room); more resources for community health workers;2/2/2018 4:30 PM 386 Monthly Engagement Community Meetings, More Resource . 2/2/2018 3:12 PM 387 Reduce Health Insurance rates, understand that each person is different but equal and must be treated with respect,2/2/2018 12:32 PM 388 JOBS 2/2/2018 12:02 PM 389 we need more affordable outlets for people to get mental health care. 2/2/2018 10:33 AM 390 Housing credits interspersed in new apartment buildings. Downtown Durham needs more affordable grocery options -- it's currently a food desert with only Whole Foods and Harris Teeter. Improve construction of current sidewalks, and include more sidewalks in and around downtown, especially around bus stops. New, safer running/bike paths that connect across the city.2/2/2018 9:27 AM 391 Combating poverty, health insurance, and affordable housing begins with employment opportunities. We must explore ALL facets of establishing entry-level and job training to learn job skills for future employment. Regarding violent crimes identifying the route cause may possibly help in decreasing some crimes but not all. This ties in with police and communities working together. However, with the initiation of any program, there needs to be a grassroots efforts as well as monetary investment. As for the grassroots effort we need to come together, talk, LISTEN, explore ALL alternatives.2/2/2018 8:14 AM 392 Communication, community meetings, leaders within the neighborhoods 2/1/2018 8:14 PM 393 I don't have any at this time 2/1/2018 8:12 PM 394 Allow people to live in housing based on their income in good neighborhoods that are not filled with violence and drugs. Provide education on sexually transmitted diseases and how to prevent them. Promote healthy eating and exercising to prevent obesity and diabetes. Offer healthy alternatives in schools and work places. Allow incentives to grocery stores to lower the process of the healthy foods and make them more accessible. This is America and there should not be poverty in America. Increase the minimum wage for people to be able to work and bring home a paycheck that will support their family. if you can fix most of the issues on this list, you will eliminate the violent crime in this city. I believe education in key, we need to spend time educating the community about healthy eating and STD's to help close the knowledge gap.2/1/2018 7:13 PM 395 Education! 2/1/2018 6:44 PM 396 Education and prioritization. 2/1/2018 6:34 PM 397 Improve healthcare access and cost. Swift sure punishment for criminals. 2/1/2018 6:28 PM 398 Unsure 2/1/2018 5:00 PM 399 Education. 2/1/2018 4:45 PM 400 Leverage existing initiatives. Evaluate effective interventions used in Durham and other communities to glean most impactful ones to develop or implement. Bring partners together from different disciplines to create solutions that address all social determinants of health- healthcare, environmental, social justice, legal, neighborhood associations. All efforts should be led by those represented if possible, and accessible to all (linguistically, etc)2/1/2018 4:40 PM 401 It starts with conversation. People need to be willing to listen to one another before coordinated community responses will be successful.2/1/2018 3:33 PM 402 Improved race relations that cultivates true relationship building and truthful discussion 2/1/2018 3:13 PM 403 I wish I knew! 2/1/2018 2:30 PM 404 Invest in our policy forces, including training on community engagement. More resources for homeless shelters and support, more public information on these resources so we can point people in the right direction for help.2/1/2018 12:29 PM 405 Community programs and groups that focus on improving health through being more active in ways that make you happier, mental health support, food education and cooking classes, all bringing participants together from across social classes to enrich the community by creating new friendships and supporting those without strong social networks.2/1/2018 12:23 PM 23 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey406 Clean affordable housing , access to medical care without discrimination, food markets in areas of low income with fresh foods/veggies, and dairy products. more jobs and job training free. Help for the elderly, to make doctors appointments, and more available ways to access a good diet.2/1/2018 9:59 AM 407 Get everyone an ID. 2/1/2018 9:44 AM 408 ? 2/1/2018 9:40 AM 409 More policing of residents violating bueatification laws and eliminating loop holes which allow the process to take longer to rectify.2/1/2018 9:36 AM 410 continued efforts to establish affordable housing. Better facilities for mental health patients- both housing and treatment facilities, including community health centers. Increased community meetings with police department, council members, city managers, commissioners and the public- to improve public perception and relatiions.2/1/2018 8:13 AM 411 Not sure, but it must involve the community and affected residents FIRST 2/1/2018 8:12 AM 412 Provide equal access to resources, Information, financial, services, service providers, programs to all citizens.2/1/2018 7:51 AM 413 Take a comprehensive look at the issue and then adequately fund efforts to increase Medicaid eligibility and a comprehensive mental health system. Take care of appropriately placing affordable housing rather than gentrifying neighborhoods that are accessible to jobs, and improve training for police officers and others who interact with various populations.2/1/2018 7:44 AM 414 not really sure but training and awareness, not overcrowding and building, leaving green areas 2/1/2018 7:04 AM 415 Community Gardens New restrictions on prescription of opioids Affordable housing units 2/1/2018 6:40 AM 416 Activities and jobs for teenagers in high poverty areas Public school health clinics and services for the community Free clinics and dental care for needy folks Shift from drug enforcement to intervention1/31/2018 11:58 PM 417 More affordable housing required of developers, tax relief for homeowners on fixed incomes at risk of losing their houses due to rising prices/gentrification, restorative justice initiatives, stop prosecuting drug possession and offer treatment as an alternative, luxury tax on houses over $100,0001/31/2018 11:28 PM 418 In schools (take-home resources such as truly healthy food; schools as a hub for family resources such as whole-family basic healthcare checks; counselling and parenting classes-- with healthy meals and childcare); in neighborhoods (same resources); ramped up \"school nurse\" (more like true primary health care) availability1/31/2018 10:53 PM 419 Something has to be done regarding home break-ins and robberies. There's only so much that a homeowner can do to protect their home.1/31/2018 6:41 PM 420 Prioritize complete streets over car based expansion. Somehow engage grocery store to enter food deserts.1/31/2018 6:36 PM 421 Racial Equity Workshops helped me see the racism. Mental Health needs more accessibility. I wish public mental health was available. Privatized mental health puts consumers in silos of what the provider offers. No one is responsible for the whole picture of the life of the consumer, despite what providers and MCOs say.1/31/2018 6:36 PM 422 Treat drug crime as a public health issue - treatment instead of prison, with a long view towards reducing the prison population.1/31/2018 5:29 PM 423 More direct communication with Police, private sector companies such as BCBSNC, City Government and community leadership. It is all connected.1/31/2018 4:21 PM 24 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey424 Affordable Housing - there is affordable housing in Durham, but mostly in problem neighborhoods. I've seen the Habitat for Humanity work in East Durham really start to turn that area around. Maybe continue that effort, which helps families learn skills for self-reliance. Poverty - Encourage self- reliance. Start providing opportunity for people to do something for themselves. Maybe provide tax incentives for local businesses to hire and/or train at-risk employees. Substance use - It's exhausting to continue to help people that do not help themselves. As long as substance abuse does not impact quality of the lives of others, it really doesn't matter. However, too many substance abusers impact others and the community negatively. Violent Crime - Durham seems to be easy on crime and criminals. It's easier said than done to say \"toughen up on crime\". Maybe find some menial jobs to assign early offenders that pay less than market value (ie - assign to pickup trash; assist rebuilding condemned public properties). Give new offenders one chance to work without serious criminal record impact, but make it clear further offenses are not tolerated. The work program can help build skills that are marketable. Violent criminals should not be on our streets....period. Panhandlers - When panhandlers start to move in, money moves out. It is difficult to enjoy an evening out at a nice restaurant when panhandlers continue to pester customers for money (if money is refused, they are quick to request items from the menu).1/31/2018 4:14 PM 425 I think if people were more open to talk and engage, be that through any number of channels in which they could talk freely and not be judged and/or discriminated against. Open forums and being able to even get something off your chest would help move things along and if things don't change atleast one can say \"no one can never say I told you so\"1/31/2018 3:50 PM 426 Implementing and modifying policies. Funding. Training and support from those in power. Local news attention. Support from local entities and organizations.1/31/2018 3:33 PM 427 I recommend more social and prevention awareness, especially with the increase cases of STDs in the state of NC. This will also improve HIV stigma that is affect PLWH (people living with HIV) in the community (e.g. individuals, health care facilities)1/31/2018 2:38 PM 428 It would be great if city residents without employer health insurance could all contribute to an aaa type health insurance in Durham.1/31/2018 1:54 PM 429 Oof. Tough question to answer as these are systemic problems that overlap. Housing: We need like, totally better, tremendous, amazing policies, beautiful policies, let me tell you, for affordable housing in Durham. All these new, shiny and big league apartment buildings are likely not very affordable. Access to healthcare: NC needs to get totally on board with Medicaid expansion in the state. This is like, totally beyond the scope of the county's work. Bigly. Community police relations: Not sure. Glad we have a new police chief, though. This is bigly yuuuge and a nice start. It looks like things are getting better. Discrimination/racism. This is tough as it's being normalized, encouraged and legalized at the highest levels of our federal government, okay? Believe me. That's what people are saying. It's tremendous. I think trans-formative training (REI) in government helps create some systemic change. Poverty. Also tough. The recent tax plan will make inequalities worse, bigly. Also, most jobs in Durham Co. are increasingly contract-based, temporary or both. Sad! This point relates back to housing and access to healthcare. Locally, I think we need to be better about investing in people, especially local folks. Totally. Hillary's emails.1/31/2018 1:49 PM 430 Probation with labor which includes picking up litter. Expand jail capacities 1/31/2018 1:16 PM 431 invest in our children and neighborhoods 1/31/2018 1:16 PM 432 More education, training, outreach, jobs, and affordable housing. 1/31/2018 12:32 PM 433 Collaboration, education, prevention 1/31/2018 12:28 PM 434 Increase awareness programs on HIV & STI, provide equity training, policy changes to ensure low & mid income families don't get priced out of homes with Downtown development; encourage schools to use meditation to promote mental health for children; more visibility for healthy/fresh food choices; remove check box on job applications about convictions; change policy to expunge marijuana convictions1/31/2018 12:28 PM 25 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey435 More access to free services. More connections between existing services. More education about discrimination and racism. More companies / neighborhoods / etc. evaluating our environments to see how we each contribute and perpetuate issues (from giving instructions to the elevator, instead of encouraging people to take the stair / providing unhealthy foods at work meetings, etc.) Our workplace tries to be energy conscious (turn off lights, monitors, / use less paper towels, etc.). But this same sort of evaluation and encouragement of small steps is not applied to habits that encourage obesity or mental health. Maybe a certification that businesses can strive for- what does a healthy workplace look like? what are we doing? where do we need to improve? how do we compare to our peers? The same sort of certification could be also be applied to organizations like churches.1/31/2018 12:25 PM 436 This is a laundry list of liberal programs. However, the thing is that there is good research that these kinds of programs work to solve these problems--most of them are in use in other first world countries, especially in Europe. Implement government funded health care for all. Construct widely dispersed affordable housing throughout Durham by making developers construct a percentage of each development for affordable housing clients. Provide ongoing training for all police in how to recognize bias--one's own and others--and include specialists trained in mental health and social work to provide advice and training for officers when dealing with people who need those services. Increase available mental health beds. Build sheltered workshop-style group homes for those with mental health or other disabilities. Provide simple, inexpensive housing for the homeless and provide social work services and counseling to enable them to become stable. Thank you.1/31/2018 12:24 PM 437 Equitable economic development in Durham, state-level legislation that supports the interests of lower-income and marginalized communities, job access, affordable housing proximate to jobs and schools, affordable and robust public transportation, equitable distribution of outdoor recreational spaces, equity in creating walkable communities, small business development in under-resourced communities that provide access to healthy and affordable food1/31/2018 11:50 AM 438 Political change, support for business/nonprofits hiring local neighbors and providing living wage/benefits.1/31/2018 11:48 AM 439 Living wage ordinance, economic development support for small businesses, affordable housing development requirements, community policing, expand project access to include mental health1/31/2018 11:39 AM 440 Additional affordable housing is needed within Durham County, especially as the housing market is on the rise. People also need stronger incentives to obtain services and to address behaviors that contribute to their ill health, homelessness, and poverty.1/31/2018 11:05 AM 441 Mental health screens and education as early as elementary school, middle and high school. Mental health days/campaigns to increase awareness of mental health issues and available support. More grocery stores closer to downtown and on the east side of town that include healthy and fresh foods. Free cooking and nutrition classes through community centers and the library that discuss healthy cooking and food budgeting for healthy cooking. Cultural festivals that are held in local parks to work on bringing people together to meet different cultures and the police in fun ways. Housing seminars on how to buy a house or knowing your rights as a renter at local community centers and/or the library.1/31/2018 11:02 AM 442 additional community resources and training 1/31/2018 10:45 AM 443 more community involvement,awareness and outreach.We need the community to be more pro- active and less re-active.1/31/2018 10:36 AM 444 Better communication between community agencies, residents, leadership and Healthcare partners1/31/2018 9:35 AM 445 Mixed income housing requirements for all new apartments built in Durham. Expanded access to mental health services and healthy food options1/31/2018 9:25 AM 446 Free formal education for those living in poverty at Durham CC. Skills pay the bills and lead to better jobs and better benefits. Teach them a trade/skill that will benefit them for life.1/31/2018 9:21 AM 447 I'd like to see the development of strong local linkages between the criminal justice system and public benefits (primarily, Medicaid and Social Security), to promote health coverage and care in the community, improve behavioral health and medication adherence, reduce recidivism, etc. - Screen all entrants to Durham County Jail for Medicaid eligibility (currently done in Cook County, IL among other counties). -Integrate local jail and Medicaid data systems, with regular electronic data transfers between the local jail and the local Medicaid agency to begin/reinstate coverage upon release.1/31/2018 9:16 AM 26 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey448 Listen, gain understanding and clarity from those representing the areas with the most need, make executable plans and implement them1/31/2018 9:11 AM 449 Higher county-wide minimum wages, affordable housing policies like inclusionary zoning, healthcare options for people without health insurance like sliding-scale clinics, Medicaid expansion at the state level1/31/2018 9:09 AM 450 Communication, communication, communication. Speaking up and out about the negative influences, attitudes and behaviors within our communities an city. Eradicate drugs, gangs and gang violence. Get rid of racism and unscrupulous police officers within the Durham Police Department; in which their are many!1/31/2018 8:53 AM 451 More clinic co-location; schools, bus depot, recreation centers. Long term commitment to affordable housing that is maintained. Public education regarding personal health1/31/2018 8:13 AM 452 Need more affordable treatment centers for opiate abuse. 1/31/2018 8:05 AM 453 Begin with the end in mind: focus on a success story that can be held up as a testament to your programs and/or policies.1/31/2018 7:01 AM 454 So many of the issues are tied together- Mental Health and Substance abuse; racism and policing and community relations; accessible healthcare and diabetes; poverty and affordable housing. The closer we can get to the larger underlying issues I feel we can get to solving the problems sustainably. Money for housing helps people get off the street, feel safe, and then can deal with other issues. Investing in Job training/education to improve wealth gap and futures for youth. Working to topple the state legislature and their theft of education dollars.1/31/2018 6:56 AM 455 Promote more awareness of jobs with many openings, and how to train for them; have mobile teams offer panhandlers daily unskilled work that comes with a free meal and minimum wages; put in sidewalks so people can walk to strip malls with supermarkets1/31/2018 6:40 AM 456 Neighborhoods need greater options for fresh foods - maybe hosting a weekly produce market in East Durham that folks can walk to would help. Substance use - have easier access to treatment and rehabilitation programs. Don't just try to get people sober - train them in a trade and provide an avenue for employment.1/31/2018 6:27 AM 457 Regarding healthcare - Medicare for ALL! The problem with healthcare in the US is that so much of it is controlled by for-profit providers and insurers.

We can't solve everything, but can't we at least assure that everyone in Durham has access to sufficient healthy food?1/30/2018 4:52 PM 469 Shared responsibility, access, and equity of resources. 1/30/2018 4:42 PM 470 Providing community funding for mental health assessment and care (so individuals without insurance can access services).

Mental health can is seen as a taboo topic in a lot of immigrant communities and also low income communities, we can help that by bringing information and assistance to those communities. Obesity, diabetes and food access can also be a topic that is brought into the classroom as early as pre-k. Teaching the children and using them to bring the information home to their families. Diabetes can be assisted by having free screening clinics, not only for children but something where the whole family can attended, get screened and learn valuable nutrition information. It could be done through a health fare. Food access could be solved with food pantries in schools/churches/community centers. Substance use is another topic that can be taboo or even seen as a norm in some low income or immigrant communities. But one way to help with this issue is having safe places where those that have a substance use issue could come and get help (organizations like AA). Access to healthcare and healthcare insurance are something that I can not think of how to help. The affordable care out has helped many, but I know it has also caused for those that once have insurance to not be able to afford it because this has cause rates for those of their economic standing to no longer be able to afford it because rates for them are now higher. Also people between the ages of 25-35 their rates have increased just because of their age.1/30/2018 1:54 PM 475 It is wonderful that we are seeing the revitalization of Durham, but this brings an increase in the cost of housing, displacement of low income families. The city is growing and developing but where are all those displaced people being housed? We need strict gun control, our children shouldn't be dying from stray bullets.1/30/2018 1:44 PM 476 The black population needs opportunities for small businesses that encourage private ownership, pride, and responsibility, vs. reliance on entitlement programs.1/30/2018 1:44 PM 477 closing the achievement gap in schools. Healthy options (medical, mental and healthy food access). Probably the cheapest way to make a big difference is to offer community yoga and meditation throughout the neighborhoods, schools, to start building wellness into all cultures.1/30/2018 12:45 PM 478 Healthcare is a political issue. Ultimately, we need a single payer federal system. In the meantime, we need to get the state legislature to expand Medicaid while they still can. Affordable housing is a top priority with the City Council, but what to do about gentrification? We need a $15 minimum wage and more blue collar jobs that have regular hours. We need more programs to recycle food that is otherwise wasted, more mobile markets. All of these issues are touched on by the lack of adequate public transit and other public amenities (decent schools, safe parks, contiguous sidewalks, and other items). Actually, I WISH we could have a progressive property tax and ways to incentivize builders to work with/for the community, but I am told neither are legal in NC right now.1/30/2018 12:18 PM 28 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey SurveyMonkey479 From the Early Childhood perspective, I am very interested in making sure that the youngest children are considered when assessing health interventions and community approaches. Addressing the needs of and supporting parents - regarding housing, mental health, substance abuse, poverty, and healthy weight - has a direct impact on children of course. We need to continue investing in the youngest children with more access to high-quality child care, especially for the youngest infants and toddlers, whose mental health and nutrition needs will be met, in conjunction with other cognitive domains of early learning. A strong child care community can also engage parents and caregivers, as well as a whole-family/whole-household approach, to strengthen the health and well-being of Durham. I would like to see more early childhood mental health interventions available to expand our current capacity.1/30/2018 12:12 PM 480 Address social determinants of health through creating a culture of health and development of resilient communities1/30/2018 12:06 PM 481 Greater breaks for low income, a better focus on Medicaid for non-families, encouraging more open food sources, companies, and easier accessible resources for learning1/30/2018 9:54 AM 482 If there is not a current community empowerment program in place, it should be implemented with the goal of demanding those in leadership roles (mayor, etc) to make changes1/30/2018 9:46 AM 483 Addressing gentrification and slowing expensive housing growth. 1/30/2018 9:38 AM 29 / 632018 Health Prioritization Survey 54.84% y la salud en el condado de Durham.
