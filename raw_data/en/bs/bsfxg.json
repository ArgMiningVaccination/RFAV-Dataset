Like I need Wired to tell me what Earth's core is made of. Or what noncoding DNA is for. Oh, and that \"Riemann hypothesis\"... is that one as unsolvable as the Poincar\u00e9 Conjecture - the BS Mensa math problem that was just solved by a crazy recluse... in RUSSIA? Give me a break, pinheads. (But: nice new fonts.) <p>Look, I understanhere you're coming from. You are a person of your time: an incurious age when action and certainty (what we in scientific circles call \"jockism\") seem to outvalue nerdish doubt and curiosity.</p> <p>I myself am of a book of COMPLETE WORLD KNOWLEDGE, entitled <em>The Areas of My rtise</em>. As the residepert on <em>The Daily Show WJon Stewart</em>, there is littft out there in the dark that puzzles me, from nuclear weapons to lice. And while I am not actually a human supercomputer/mentat, I do play one on television, and I understand the temptation to believe that you have all the answers.</p> <p>But consider lThomson, the First Baron Kelvin. In 1900, most thinkers agreed that almost every mystery of the physical world had been more or less revealed. The small questions that remained, primarily the properties of light and black-body radiation, were described by Kelvin as twin clouds in the otherwise clear sky of knowledge - perhaps unfathomable, ultimately trivial, and if you looked at them the right way, shaped like fluffy white kittens.</p> <p>Of course, w ad upon by more curious minds, those clouds would gather into thunderheads. Solving the mysteries of light's behavior led to relativity, and understanding radiation pointed the way to quantum mechanics. Not even Lord Kelvin, sequestered as always in his protective, absolute-zero chamber, would be safe from the resulting tempest of progress and wrenching change.</p> <p>Now it is 10 alater, and how much more we know still! We would be like gods to the supposed wise men of Lord Kelvin's age, as I learned the hard way during my time travels. I lived among those savage \"scientists,\" with their beastly monocles, and allowed them to fetch me grapes and build statues in my likeness. And I quickly became what most people and societies become when they believe they know everything: incurious, self-satisfied, flabby, and prone to wearing tunics and lounging on grassy lawns while watching those idiot scientists fight with knives for my amusement. Now, I agree that <em>sounds</em> awes but ility it was terrible. For one, all the scientists wanted to talk about was those Mac ads. For two, I came to suspect they were planning to eat me. And also, I became less human.</p> <p>Because in a lhere there are no more grails or dragons (thanks a lot, hippies), it is questing after big answers that defines and propels us as a species. Included in this issue are just some of the koanlike brain busters that continue to vex even our most advanced thinkers and maga-zine writers, mysteries such as...</p> <p>How does lif ifrom nonlife? What is sleep and why do we do it? What is the universe made of? Why is time different from other dimensions? And that old saw, what is Earth's core made of? (Hint: It's only <em>partially</em> nt, smartys.)</p> <p>Later, I wil vou the rest of the answers in a special BIG ANSWERS issue I am compiling that will be printed upside down and released at the end of the world.</p> <p>For while th mbe legitimate, eternal mysteries out there that are beyond our comprehension, history, in fact, shows us that if we do ask questions, we are likely to find the answers eventually - which is perhaps more frightening than ignorance.</p> <p>As Lord Kelv eed the hard way, it's the answers to big questions that will redraw our vision of the world, elevate us in it, or even erase us. And that is why, despite what they tell you, being curious is the bravest human act, aside from skydiving.</p> <p>But otherwis ae <p><strong>Wha tre?</strong> We know th center of the planet, about 4,000 miles down, sits a solid ball of iron the size of the moon. We also know that we're standing on about 1,800 miles of rock, which forms Earth's crust and mantle. But what's in between the mantle and the iron ball? A churning ocean of liquid of some sort, but scientists aren't certain what it's made of or how it reacts to the stuff around it.</p> <p>We're confid te's a lot of iron in this ocean. But what else? Based on what researchers understand about the pressure, temperature, and density of materials down there, some maintain that the core also contains lots of hydrogen and sulfur. <a href=\"http://astr [of UC Berkeley](http://astro.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/jeanloz.html) eves that another component is oxygen, which comes from rocks in the part of the mantle that borders the liquid core.</p> <p>Knowing more uhe molten concoction would give scientists clues about how Earth formed and how heat and convection affect plate tectonics. More information could help solve another mystery, too: whether, as many researchers suspect, the inner core is growing. If so, it could eventually overtake the molten metal surrounding it, throwing off <a href=\"http://en.w illusion. <a href=\"http://www.

Time isn't like those other dimensions - for one thing, we move only one way within it. \"What's needed is not to make the notion of time and general relativity work or to go back to the notion of absolute time, but to invent something radically new,\" says <a href=\"http://en.w [ysicist at](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Smolin) Perimeter Institute in Waterloo, Ontario.

Suddenly the cube makes copies of itself - two, four, eight, 16. The proliferating cubes begin to form structures - enclosures, arches, walls, tubes. Some of the tubes turn into wires, PVC pipes, structural steel, wooden studs. Sheets of cubes become wallboard and wood paneling, carpet and plate-glass windows.

Eventually, a 100-story skyscraper stands in the field.</p> <p>That's basic](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/15.02/#) process a fertilized cell undergoes beginning with the moment of conception. How did that cube know how to make a skyscraper? How does a cell know how to make a human (or any other mammal)? Biologists used to think that the cellular proteins somehow carried the instructions. But now proteins look more like pieces of brick and stone - useless without a building plan and a mason. The instructions for how to build an organism must be written in a cell's DNA, but no one has figured out exactly how to read them. - Steve Olson, <em>author of</em> Mng They were ns, our hominid cousins.

By most measures, the Neanderthals were the equal of our direct ancestors, the fully modern out-of-Africa characters often called <a href=\"http://www. [h whom the](http://www.mnh.si.edu/anthro/humanorigins/ha/cromagnon.html) derthals coexisted for thousands of years. Like our forebears, Neanderthals were supple sojourners, happily colonizing parts of Africa, Europe, and Asia. They stood upright, skillfully sculpted and wielded stone tools, and buried their dead with pomp and hope. They were slightly larger and more muscular than their Cro-Magnon counterparts, and their brains were bigger, too. Yet by about 30,000 years ago, the Neanderthals had vanished, leaving Cro-Magnons as the sole survivors of the tangled Hominina tribe. Moreover, while Neanderthals may well have been capable of interbreeding with Cro-Magnons, recent DNA analysis has revealed no signs that such Stone Age Capulet-Montague mergers occurred.</p> <p>Some scienti hattributed the Neanderthals' demise to chronic disease, pointing out that many Neanderthal skeletal remains show signs of arthritis and other bone disorders. Other people have wondered whether genocide was to blame. Perhaps the Cro-Magnons systematically exterminated their competitors, just as chimpanzees have been observed hunting down and killing every last member of a neighboring chimp troupe.</p> <p>Another, mor c, hypothesis is that <em>Homo sapiens</emtcompeted <eo neanderthals</em> because of a dence in their economic systems.

The Cro-Magnons, by contrast, appear to have divided labor along more or less sexual lines, with men doing most of the big-game killing, women and children gathering tubers and other plant foods, and everybody sharing the flesh and fruits of their efforts. By adopting this sort of specialization of labor, the researchers speculate, <em>Homo sapiens</emkely proved efficient and flexible than Neanderthals and were able to expand their population more rapidly.</p> <p>In other wor aeast according to this new theory put forward by Stiner and Kuhn, the Neanderthals weren't felled by a pathogen or a primordial <a href=\"http://topi [a>.

One leading theory says that while we're awake, a substance builds up in the brain (or gets depleted) and sleep removes (or replenishes) it. That makes sense.

We're improbable, we're here, and we have no idea why. Or how. of an experiment?</strong> Paging Capous: To perform a legitimate experiment, scientists must observe the results of a system in motion without influencing those results. Turns out that's harder than it sounds. In 1927, German physicist <a href=\"http://nobe [> discovered that](http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1932/heisenberg-bio.html)the Wonderland-like subatomic realm, it is impossible to measure position and momentum simultaneously. \"In an attempt to observe an electron or other subatomic particle using light, very short wavelengths of light are required,\" says <a href=\"http://www. [science hist](http://www.hofstra.edu/Academics/HCLAS/Chemistry/CHM_faculty_cassidy.cfm)n and Heisenberg expert at Hofstra University. \"But when that light hits the electron, it knocks it all over the place like a billiard ball.\" This can become a serious issue when you're working with the kind of focused, high-intensity beams found in, say, particle accelerators. \"The more precise the momentum of the beam particles,\" Cassidy says, \"the more difficult it becomes to focus the beam.\"</p> <p>The real pro ,ough, is what this so-called observer effect does to reality. Do an experiment to find the fundamental unit of light and you find particles called photons. But change the conditions of the experiment and you get waves. Physicists have no problem with the cognitive dissonance of this \"<a href=\"http://en.w [y</a>.\" But... so... what](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave-particle_duality)ight made out of, really? The dichotomy raises the mind-boggling prospect that unless we observe an event or thing, it hasn't really happened, that all possible futures are quantum probability functions waiting for someone to notice them - trees falling unheard in a forest. Maybe this article wasn't even here until you turned to this page. - Elizabeth Svoboda, <em>San <a href=\"http://plat [> is that a pair](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm/) ubatomic particles can sometimes become \"entangled.\" This means the fate of one instantly affects the other, no matter how far apart they are. It's such a bizarre phenomenon that Einstein dissed the idea in the 1930s as \"spooky action at a distance,\" saying it showed that the developing model of the atomic world needed rethinking.</p> <p>But it turns t the universe is spooky after all. In 1997, scientists separated a pair of entangled photons by shooting them through fiber-optic cables to two villages 6 miles apart. Tipping one into a particular quantum state forced the other into the opposite state less than five-trillionths of a second later, or nearly 7 million times faster than light could travel between the two. Of course, according to relativity, nothing travels faster than the speed of light - not even information between particles.</p> <p>Even the bes ees to explain how entanglement gets around this problem seem preposterous. One, for example, speculates that signals are shot back through time. Ultimately, the answer is bound to be unnerving: According to a famous doctrine called <a href=\"http://en.w [>, for entangleme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_Theorem)o square with relativity, either we have no free will or reality is an illusion. Some choice. - Lucas Graves, <em>New York City-bawriter</em></p> a psychologist at Columbia University, he zaps people with brief electric surges in order to study the placebo effect, one of the most mysterious phenomena in modern medicine. In <a href=\"http://www. [t</a>, Wager and a gr](http://www.scienceblog.com/community/older/2002/G/20021072.html)of colleagues delivered harsh shocks to the wrists of 24 test subjects. Then the researchers rubbed an inert cream on the subjects' wrists but told them it contained an analgesic. When the scientists delivered the next set of shocks, eight of the subjects reported experiencing significantly less pain.</p> <p>The idea tha ocuous lotion could ease the agony of an electric shock seems remarkable. Yet placebos can be as powerful as the best modern medicine. Studies show that between 30 and 40 percent of patients report feeling better after taking dummy pills for conditions ranging from depression to high blood pressure to Parkinson's. Even sham surgery can work marvels. In a recent study, doctors at Houston's Veterans Affairs Medical Center performed arthroscopic knee surgery on one group of patients with arthritis, scraping and rinsing their knee joints. On another group, the doctors made small cuts in the patients' knees to mimic the incisions of a real operation and then bandaged them up. The pain relief reported by the two groups was identical. \"As far as I know, the placebo effect has never raised the dead,\" says <a href=\"http://www. [professor at](http://www.utmb.edu/imh/faculty.asp?FacID=49) University of Texas Medical Branch and author of a book on the subject. \"But the vast majority of medical conditions respond to placebo at least to some degree.\"</p> <p>How do place hsuch an effect? Nobody knows. Studies have shown that our brains can release chemicals that mimic the activity of morphine when we're treated with placebo analgesics. But only lately have researchers begun to pin down the underlying physiological mechanisms. In his groundbreaking electrical-shock experiment, Wager used functional MRI to examine images of the brain activity of his subjects. When a person knew a painful stimulus was imminent, the brain lit up in the prefrontal cortex, the region used for high-level thinking. When the researchers applied the placebo cream, the prefrontal cortex lit up even brighter, suggesting the subject might be anticipating relief. Then, when the shock came, patients showed decreased activity in areas of the brain where many pain-sensitive neurons lead.</p> <p>One day, thi rf research could point toward new treatments that harness the mind to help the body. Until then, doctors are divided on the ethics of knowingly prescribing placebos. Some think it's shady to perform mock surgery or offer a patient pills that contain no active ingredients. Yet the best doctors have always employed one form of placebo: Studies show that empathy from an authoritative yet caring physician can be deeply therapeutic. Maybe handing out the occasional sugar pill isn't such a bad idea. - <a href=\"http://www. [, <em>senior fel](http://www.newamerica.net/people/shannon_brownlee)at of?</strong> Astronomerg the heavens with powerful telescopes can see objects that are billions of trillions of miles away. These observations have proven essential to piecing together a fairly refined picture of the history and evolution of the cosmos. Nevertheless, a gaping hole remains in our understanding of a basic question: What is the universe made of? For more than 100 years we've known about atoms, and over the past century or so we've gone further and identified atomic constituents like electrons and quarks, as well as their exotic cousins - neutrinos, muons, and the like. But there is now convincing evidence that these ingredients are a cosmic afterthought. Current data shows that if you weighed everything in existence, these familiar particles would amount to about 5 percent of the total. Most of the universe is composed of other stuff, which, with all of science's deep insights, we've yet to identify.</p> <p>How do we kn](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/15.02/#) hWell, over the course of many decades, astronomers studied the motion of galaxies and the stars within them, and found that the gravity exerted by this luminous matter was insufficient to account for the way these heavenly bodies moved. Only by positing large amounts of additional matter that doesn't give off light (visible, x-ray, infrared, or any other kind) and is thus invisible to telescopes, could the data be explained. Through detailed cosmological measurements, scientists also discovered that this so-called dark matter couldn't be made of the same electrons, protons, and neutrons that make up everything with which we are familiar.</p> <p>Then, in the e90s, two groups of astronomers, one led by <a href=\"http://www. [of the Lawrence](http://www.oarval.org/SCPen.htm)keley National Laboratory, the other by <a href=\"http://msow [the Australi](http://msowww.anu.edu.au/~brian/)ational University, found something even stranger. Through observation of distant supernovas, these astronomers measured how the expansion rate of the universe has changed over time. Because of gravity's relentless pull, most everyone expected that the expansion would be slowing. But the data from both groups showed the opposite. The expansion of the universe is speeding up. Something must be pushing outward, and luckily Einstein's general theory of relativity provides a ready-made candidate: A uniform, diffuse energy spread throughout space can act as an antigravity force. Since this energy gives off no light, it's called dark energy.</p> <p>Collectively eservations establish that about 23 percent of the universe is <a href=\"http://en.w [about 72 pe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter)t is dark energy. Everything else is squeezed into the remaining few percent.</p> <p>Several expe nare now under way to identify dark matter. Scientists are searching for what they suspect is an exotic species of particle. Some studies are looking for clues by analyzing particles bombarding Earth from space; others, like the Large Hadron Collider, will analyze collisions between extremely fast-moving protons that have the potential to create dark matter in the lab. We are guardedly optimistic that we'll be able to identify dark matter soon.</p> <p>By contrast, stion of dark energy is wide open. What is its origin? What determined its quantity? Does the amount stay constant or vary? These are critical questions. Calculations show that if the amount of dark energy had been slightly larger, the universe would have blown apart so quickly that life as we know it could not exist. DNA?</strong> A typical l contains more than 6 feet of tightly cornrowed DNA. But only about an inch of that carries the codes needed to make proteins, the day laborers of biology. What's the other 71 inches?</p> <p>It's junk, N i<a href=\"http://nobe [aid after it w](http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2002/brenner-autobio.html)iscovered back in the 1970s. The name stuck, but biologists have known for a while that the junk DNA must contain treasures. If noncoding DNA were just along for the ride, it would rapidly incorporate mutations. But long stretches of noncoding DNA have remained basically the same for many millions of years - they must be doing something.</p> <p>Now scientis rtarting to speculate that proteins, and the regular DNA that creates them, are just the nuts and bolts of the system. \"They're like the parts for a 757 jet sitting on the floor of a factory,\" says University of Queensland geneticist <a href=\"http://www. [e noncoding](http://www.imb.uq.edu.au/?page=12238&pid=) is likely \"the assembly plans and control systems.\" Unfortunately, he concludes, because we've spent 30 years thinking of it as junk, we're just now learning how to read it. - Steve Olson</p> <p [eobal warming - or speed it up?</strong> Everyone k forests are good for the environment. By removing carbon dioxide - the principal cause of global warming - from the air, trees grow. And the bigger and more plentiful the trees, the more CO 2 they sequester. This makes forests a helpful bulwark against climate change. But despite the best carbon-eating action of our flora, the planet is heating up. This raises the specter of a future in which, paradoxically, forests don't reduce climate change but - as they are destroyed - make it worse.</p> <p>We don't kno](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/15.02/#) iway it will go, because we know so little about forests themselves. Scientists estimate that up to 50 percent of all species live in forest canopies - three-dimensional labyrinths largely invisible from the ground - but virtually no one can tell you what lives in any given cubic meter of canopy, at any height, anywhere in the world. We don't even have names for the most common species of trees in the Amazon.</p> <p>But scientis aeadily foresee the way in which these carbon killers instead become dangerous carbon spewers. As the climate warms, many forests will become drier, putting the trees under stress. Typically, this sets the stage for huge outbreaks of insects, which can strip trees of their leaves, killing large numbers of them. Once dead, trees release their carbon into the air - already roughly 25 percent of the greenhouse gases pouring into the atmosphere come from forests that are burned or cut down. Further, if they no longer exist, forests can't absorb CO 2 anymore, and the bare ground that is exposed heats up faster - forests are like giant swamp coolers for the planet. Will this happen?</p> <p>Hard to say. won't know which insects are eating the leaves now, we can't gauge how global warming will affect them or how they in turn might affect forests. \"You can't possibly answer more general questions about forests until you at least know what lives there,\" says Margaret Lowman, canopy scientist at New College of Florida. \"It's more than just giving names to things. We need to know what's common and what's rare, and what these species are doing, before we can go to the next level, which is to try to see the interaction between forests and Earth's climate.\" in a black hole?</strong> Inside a b, gravity is so intense that neither matter nor energy can escape. But in 1975, Cambridge physicist <a href=\"http://www. [said that somet](http://www.hawking.org.uk/home/hindex.html) does escape: random particles now known as \"Hawking radiation.\" So if black holes eat organized matter - chock-full of information - and then spit out random noise, where does the information go?</p> <p>Hawking said glocked up inside as the black hole eventually evaporates, destroying the information in the process. Which creates a paradox. Because the rules of physics say information, like matter and energy, can't be destroyed.</p> <p>Hawking was it. He convinced his super-genius counterpart at Caltech, physicist <a href=\"http://www. [Th](http://www.theory.caltech.edu/people/preskill/info_bet.html) said the singularity at the heart of a black hole destroyed information; Preskill said \"nuh-uh.\" Then, in 2004, Hawking reversed his position and decided that things that fall into a singularity aren't lost; their information does leak out, though no one, except maybe Hawking himself, can explain why or how.</p> <p>He presented sl with a <a href=\"http://www.

That's fine for figuring out how to pack for a business trip or whether you need to rent a big tent for the wedding reception. The trouble starts when you want to build a computer model to predict the weather over decades or centuries. In 1961, a meteorologist named Edward Lorenz was running a computerized weather simulation and decided to round a few decimal places off one of the parameters. The tiny tweak completely changed weather patterns. This became known as the butterfly effect: A butterfly flapping its wings in Brazil sets off a tornado in Texas. Lorenz's shortcut helped launch chaos theory and sparked an obsession among meteorologists with feeding as-perfect-as-possible data into their models in an attempt to lengthen their forecast window.</p> <p>But even ref gecision doesn't get us to long-term prediction.

But no one even conceived of <em>bits</em> until midd the 20th century. The bit is a fundamental particle, too, but of different stuff altogether: information. It is not just tiny, it is abstract - a flip-flop, a yes-or-no. Now that scientists are finally starting to understand information, they wonder whether it's more fundamental than matter itself. Perhaps the bit is the irreducible kernel of existence; if so, we have entered the information age in more ways than one.</p> <p>The quantum eJohn Archibald Wheeler, perhaps the last surviving collaborator of both Albert Einstein and Niels Bohr, poses this conundrum in oracular monosyllables: \"It from bit.\" For Wheeler, it is both an unanswered question and a working hypothesis, the idea that information gives rise, as he writes, to \"every it - every particle, every field of force, even the spacetime continuum itself.\" This is another way of fathoming the role of the observer, the quantum discovery that the outcome of an experiment is affected, or even determined, when it is observed. \"What we call reality,\" Wheeler writes coyly, \"arises in the last analysis from the posing of yes-no questions.\" He adds, \"All things physical are information-theoretic in origin, and this is a participatory universe.\"</p> <p>Earlier gene owould not have been able to imagine information as so... meaty. How could this abstract quality be substantial enough - enough of a <em>thing</em> - to he sute of all existence? Its newly powerful status began to emerge in 1948, when Claude Shannon at Bell Labs invented information theory. His scientific framework introduced the bit, defined concepts like signal and noise, and pointed the way to modems and compact discs, cell phones and cyberspace, Moore's law, Metcalfe's law, and a world of silicon valleys and alleys.</p> <p>Now the whol ise is seen as a computer - a cosmic processor of information.

After all, germs want what we all want, evolution-wise: to spread their genes. Success in the germ world means infecting a whole lot of people, reproducing, then infecting a whole lot more. The efficiency with which a microbe pulls that off depends on how the bug works and how the target - us - works. HIV, for example, loves a promiscuous-but-prudish population; human beings like to have sex but don't like to talk about condoms. The Ebola virus, on the other hand, hasn't found victims who exchange fluids with enough other people before dying (horribly). So changes in culture like jet airplane travel can make a population more vulnerable to a previously contained disease. And changes in a germ - say, if avian influenza H5N1 acquires the right genes from the human version - can be like spinach to Popeye.

Basically, the larger the species, the slower its energy-delivery systems (all that internal tubing, all that complicated traffic); the lower the metabolic rate, the longer the life.

Yet while many animals outmass us humans, few outlive us. Why the long life for us lightweights? Like the hide of a rhinoceros or the claws of a tiger, human cleverness makes us tough to kill. That means random longevity-enhancing genes have a pretty good shot at evading natural selection. A bird that gets eaten in its second month of life never passes on whatever fluke mutation might have given it - and its progeny - an extra year or two.</p> <p>As for the e gs' neat mathematical equation, \"primates are a little different,\" Enquist concedes. \"For the number of heartbeats we have in our lives, we live a little longer than we should, and it's a big mystery why that is.\" He speculates that the difference for us outliers will be explained by brain size - or, rather, by how much time and energy humans spend growing their brains relative to the rest of their bodies. Why lavishing that extra energy on brainmaking translates into disproportionately long lives, Enquist isn't sure (and at 37, he has only about 36 more years to figure it out). Luckily, the same biological aberration that allows people to contemplate their own mortality is responsible, albeit indirectly, for delaying it. - Susan Dominus, <em>writer for</em> New York Isaac Newt**figured out the fundamental nature of gravity in the late 1600s.
