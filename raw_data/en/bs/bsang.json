The present study was predicted to evaluate antibacterial activity of cinnamon, lavender, tea tree, lemon, coconut, oregano, mint, laurel and eucalyptus EOs alone and in combination. Chemical components of effective EOs were examined through gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) assays were used to identify antibacterial effects of EOs against bacterial strains. The Fractional Inhibitory Concentration index (FICI) of the binary combinations of EOs was determined by checkerboard method. Carvacrol, linalool, linalyl acetate, 1,8-cineole, cinnamaldehyde, were found main components of EOs. Oregano, cinnamon and tea tree EOs exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity with the MIC range between 0.03125-1.00% (v/v). Tea tree/lavender and cinnamon/lavender mixtures Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae. Oregano with tea tree and laurel exhibited a synergistic effect against Staphylococcus aureus. Oregano showed a synergistic effect when combined with cinnamon, lavender and tea tree against S.agalactiae. Our findings indicated that EOs either alone or in combination against pathogens should be preferred as potential antibacterial agents. Key words Antibacterial efficiency; essential INTRODUCTION S. pyogenes asymptomatically colonizes skin and upper respiratory tract of individuals and may lead to outbreaks and causes wide variety of diseases including toxin-mediated diseases [like scarlet fever and streptococcal toxic and vaginitis) (Cunningham Chemother 45: 3-12. https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/45.suppl_1.3. [https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/45.suppl_1.3... ](https://doi.org/10.1093/jac/45.suppl_1.3)). Penicillin is preferred antibiotic in the treatment of streptococcal tonsillopharyngitis, and penicillin resistance has not been detected yet. Beta lactam antibiotics (such as macrolides and lincosamides) are used in the case of penicillin allergy or penicillin intolerant (Choby 2009CHOBY BA. 2009. Diagnosis and treatment Physician 2013 Dosage error in article text. PMID: 19275067., Brook 2001BROOK I. 2001. Failure of penicillin to eradicate group A beta-hemolytic streptococci tonsillitis: [https://doi.org/10.2310/7070.2001.19359... ](https://doi.org/10.2310/7070.2001.19359)). However, it has been reported that antibiotic resistance to S.pyogenes strains are rapidly increasing all over the world (Richter et al. 2005RICHTER SS, HEILMANN KP, BEEKMANN SE, MILLER NJ, MILLER AL, RICE CL, REID SD & DOERN GV. https://doi.org/10.1086/432473. [https://doi.org/10.1086/432473... ](https://doi.org/10.1086/432473)). S. aureus is a commensal bacterium that can colonize at the skin, mucosa and nasal vestibule in humans. Moreover, they also cause many infections (like osteomyelitis, nosocomial and mild superficial skin infections, implant-associated heart valve, endocarditis, severe sepsis and bacteremia) with virulence factors such as toxins and enzymes. Mortality may occurrates will be higher when patients are not treated effectively (Jenul & Horswill 2018JENUL C & HORSWILL AR. 2019. https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199808203390806. [https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199808203390... ](https://doi.org/10.1056/NEJM199808203390806), Sutcliffe et al. 2019SUTCLIFFE CG ET AL. 2019. The burden of Staphylococcus aureus among native Americans on the Navajo nation. PLoS JERNIGAN DB. 2006. Staphylococcus aureus-associated skin and soft tissue infections in ambulatory care. Emerg Infect Dis 12: 1715-1723. https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1211.060190. [https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1211.060190... ](https://doi.org/10.3201/eid1211.060190)). The treatment of S.aureus infections, including soft tissue infections, are becoming more difficult due to increasing resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics among species. Methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) strains can develop not only nozocomial, but also in outpatients (Velasco et al. 2005VELASCO V, E, SHERWOOD JS, STEPAN RM, KOSLOFSKY RJ & LOGUE CM. 2015. Characterization of Staphylococcus aureus from humans and a comparison with isolates of animal origin, in North Dakota, United States. PLoS ONE 10: 0140497. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0140497. commensal bacterium located at the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems of up to 30% of healthy adults without showing clinical symptoms. On the other hand, this bacteria may colonized during through the passage of the birth canal in newborns which can cause severe neonatal disease like sepsis, meningitis and pneumonia (Nuccitelli et al. 2015NUCCITELLI A, RINAUDO CD & MAIONE D. 2015. Group B Streptococcus vaccine: state of Ther Adv antibiotics against S.agalactiae. Cefazolin, clindamycin, erythromycin and vancomycin are used as an alternative drugs to penicillin. Antibiotic resistance has been observed since the beginning of the antibiotic age. Increasing the drug resistance and invasive bacteria, and also decreasing in the development and approval of new drugs are threaten human health worldwide (Biasi-Garbin et al. 2015BIASI-GARBIN RP ET AL. 2015. Effect of eugenol against Streptococcus agalactiae and synergistic interaction with CDC 2010CDC - CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. 2010.

Retrieved 21 September 2017. [https://www.cdc.gov/groupbstrep/about/sy... ](https://www.cdc.gov/groupbstrep/about/symptoms.html)). Highly toxic and expensive drugs are used due to increasing resistance to empirical antibiotics (Marasini et al. 2015MARASINI BP, BARAL P, ARYAL N, SINGH A, GHIMIRE L & SHRESTHA K. 2015. Evaluation of antibacterial activity of some traditionally used medicinal plants against human pathogenic bacteria. Biomed Res Int 2015: 6. https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/265425. [https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/265425... ](https://doi.org/10.1155/2015/265425)). In the 21st century, multidrug-resistant bacteria poses a serious threat to health due to increasing prevalence of them. The report was published by the World Health Organization in 2017, it was stated that new antibiotics should be discovered urgently (Martelli & Giacomini 2018MARTELLI G & GIACOMINI D. 2018. Antibacterial and antioxidant activities for natural and synthetic dual active compounds. Eur J Med Chem 158: 91-105. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.09.009. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.09... ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmech.2018.09.009), WHO 2017WHO - WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION. 2017. A Global Health Guardian: Climate Change, Air Pollution and Antimicrobial. Geneva, Switzerland: World Health Organization.). Although the pharmaceutical industry has produced many new antibiotics in the last decade, microbial resistance to these drugs has increased gradually (Nascimento et al. 2000NASCIMENTO GG, LOCATELLI J, FREITAS PC & SILVA GL. 2000. Antibacterial activity of plant extracts and including nature bioactive compounds are preferred to treat bacterial infection as alternative antibacterial agents to antibiotics (Rossiter et al. 2017ROSSITER SE, FLETCHER MH & WUEST WM. 2017. Natural products as platforms to overcome antibiotic resistance. Chem Rev 117: 12415-12474. https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00283. [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00... ](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrev.7b00283)). Having a great biodiversity (250,000 to 500,000 species) of plants are bioactive phytochemical molecules, in contrast to the limited, non-renewable capacity of current antibiotics, and they can be continuously renewed (Abdallah 2011ABDALLAH EM. 2011. Plants: An alternative source for antimicrobials. J Appl Pharm Sci 1 (6): 16-20.). Plant-based products have been shown to be effective against different bacterial pathogens compared to antibiotics having serious side effects (Chandra et al. 2017CHANDRA H, BISHNOI P, YADAV MISHRA AP & NAUTIYAL AR. 2017. Antimicrobial Resistance and the Alternative Resources with Special Emphasis on Plant-Based Antimicrobials-A Review. Plants 6(2): 16. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants6020016. [https://doi.org/10.3390/plants6020016... ](https://doi.org/10.3390/plants6020016)). EOs or aromatic plant extracts are volatile and fragrant substances, exhibit antibacterial properties and are synthesized by the organs of the plants (flower, root, leaf, stem, etc.) (Balz 1999BALZ R. 1999. The Healing Power of Essential Oils, 1st ed.; Lotus Press: Twin Lakes, WI, USA, p. 27-80., Bakkali al. 2008BAKKALI F, AVERBECK S, AVERBECK D & IDAOMAR M. 2008. Biological effects of essential review.

To demand for EOs is increasing with the increasing tendency of consumers to the natural treatment. While global market demand was 61.8 kilotons in 2014; it has increased to 226.9 kilotons in 2018 and still continues to rise (Essential Oils Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report by Application 2019ESSENTIAL OILS MARKET SIZE, SHARE & TRENDS ANALYSIS REPORT BY APPLICATION (CLEANING & HOME, MEDICAL, FOOD & BEVERAGES, SPA & RELAXATION), BY PRODUCT, BY SALES CHANNEL, AND SEGMENT FORECASTS, 2019-2025.

[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/indust... ](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/essential-oilsmarket)). The antibacterial effects of many EOs have been shown in studies. EOs containing natural compounds are used to product antibacterial drugs, and this is promising for the treatment of bacterial diseases (Jalal et al. 2015JALAL Z, ELATKI Y, LYOUSSI B &ABDELLAOUI A. 2015.

Studies have shown that combinations of EOs or mixtures of purified main constituents are more effective on target bacteria (Shi et al. 2017SHI C, ZHANG X, ZHAO X, MENG R, LIU Z, CHEN X & GUO N. 2017.

[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.... ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodcont.2016.06.020)). Some studies have been reported that combining different EOs were lead to exhibit better antibacterial activity than applied alone as the same concentrations (Gutierrez et al. 2008GUTIERREZ J, BARRY-RYAN C & BOURKE P. 2008.

It has been reported that very few components showed synergistic activity, but exhibited antagonistic and additive effects (Davidson & Parish 1989DAVIDSON PM & PARISH ME. 1989.

The purpose of present study was to evaluate antibacterial activity of 9 EOs (cinnamon, lavender, tea tree, lemon, coconut, oregano, mint, laurel and eucalyptus) against S .pyogenes, S. aureus and S. agalactiae in vitro using agar disc diffusion method. MIC and MBC of effective EOs were determined. Furthermore, the FICI of the binary combinations of EOs against tested human pathogens were performed to detect synergic, additive, no interactive or antagonistic effects using the checkerboard assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and preparation of cultures S. pyogenes were used in this study and obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (USA). The bacterial cultures were maintained in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB, Sigma\u00ae) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol (TSA, Sigma\u00ae) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24h. After this initial growth cycle, they were subcultured into TSB and grown under the same conditions. In antimicrobial experiments, the bacterial cultures were adjusted to a density of 0.5 McFarland Standard (108 CFU/mL) with a sterile 9% aqueous solution of NaCl (Mello et al. 2014MELLO S, F, FRONZA N, CUNHA A, NEUD G & ROSANA C. 2014.

Food Sci Technol laurel (Laurus nobilis) EOs purified by steam distillation method and were obtained from commercial company in Turkey and stored at 4 \u00b0C in dark prior to use. Each EO containig 2.5% Tween 20 sterilized via 0,2 \u00b5m syringe filter. Chemical compositons of EOs by GC-MS Major and minor chemical components of these EOs were analysed by GC-MS using a Agilent 7697A GC/MSD (Agilent Tehnologies, Clara, USA) system equipped with an Agilent DB-1 MS capillary column (30 m \u00d7 320 m \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5m). The GC oven was programmed at 50 \u00b0C for 1 min, then at 2 \u00b0C per minute to 120 \u00b0C for 1 min and finally at 4\u00b0 C per minute to 280 \u00b0C for 13 min. Helium (He) was used as carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.8 ml/min. The injector and detector temperature were 250\u00b0C and 325\u00b0C, respectively. The split ratio was 1:40. The injection volume was 3 \u00b5l. The mass spectra (MS) ionization energy was 70 Ev. The various compounds of EO were determined by comparing retention indexes (RI) and recorded mass spectra with the data of standard samples and Wiley library was also consulted (Kivrak et al. 2009KIVRAK I, DURU ME, OZTURK M, TOPCU G. 2009. Antioxidant, anticholinesterase and antimicrobial constituents from the essential oil and ethanol extract of Antimicrobial activity of 9 EOs was investigated against 3 bacterial strains using the disc diffusion method as described Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI 2012CLSI - CLINICAL AND LABORATORY STANDARDS INSTITUTE. 2012. \"Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Disk Susceptibility Tests; Approved Standard- 11th Edition,\" Pennsylvania 19087, USA.). The bacterial suspensions were inoculated the entire surface of Muller Hinton Agar (MHA, Sigma\u00ae) plates. 10 \u00b5l of each EO was impregnated on a steril 6mm diameter blank paper disc and aseptically placed onto the surface of the inoculated plates and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. Then, all plates were incubated under 5% CO2 at 37 \u00b0C for 24h to avoid evaporation. Vancomycin (30 \u00b5g/disc, Oxoid) was used as a positive control; a blank disc (Oxoid) impregnated with sterile distilled water was used as a negative control for bacterial inhibition. After incubation, the diameter of inhibition zones were measured in mm. Each experiment was done in triplicate. Determination of MIC and MBC EOs with a large inhibition zones were chosen to examine for their antimicrobial was estimated by microdilution method in 96 well plates according to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) with modifications (Wayne 2012WAYNE PA. 2012.

The growth control (negative control) consisted of growing the microorganisms in TSB culture medium with 2.5% Tween 20 was put into 12th well. Then 20 \u00b5l of each bacterial suspension (containing 108 CFU/mL of bacteria) added to each well. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 24h, MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of EO at which no visible growth (no white pellet) of pathogen compared with control. To determine MBC values, 10 \u00b5l of inoculum was taken aseptic conditions from negative wells that showing absence of visible turbidity and transferred onto TSA. After incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 24h, the lowest EO concentration in which tested microorganism eliminated, was declarated as MBC (Bouyahya et al. 2017BOUYAHYA EL-BOURY J & BAKRI Y. 2017. Correlation between phenological changes, chemical composition and biological activities of the essential oil from Moroccan endemic Oregano (Origanum antibacterial the MBC/MIC ratio was <4, the EO was determined as a bactericidal and when the ratio was >4, it was considered as a bacteriostatic (Levison 2004LEVISON ME. 2004.

First EO was dispensed horizontally, second EO was introduced vertically into the plates according to the MIC values. The final volume in each well was 200 \u00b5l (90 \u00b5l EO1+90 \u00b5l EO2+20 \u00b5l bacterial suspension). The growth control was put into the 12th-H well. The plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 18-24h. The interaction between two EO combinations was obtained by FICI values using the following formula: The analyse results were interpreted as synergy (FICI0.5), addition (0.5<FIC 1), (1<FIC4) amino acid decarboxylase activity of Enterobacter aerogenes by active components HOHMANN J. 2006.

Values of p<0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS Chemical composition of EOs The qualitative characterizations of EOs were identified by GC-MS. The chemical constituents were presented in [Table I](). and -pinene (9.63%) in tea tree oil were the most abundant constituents found in EOs. The components and percentage composition of EOs analysed by-GC-MS. Screening of EOs antibacterial ability The antibacterial activity of 9 EOs (oregano, cinnamon, lavender, tea tree, laurel, mint, lemon, coconut and eucalyptus) against S. pyogenes ATCC 19615, S. aureus ATCC 25923 12386 strains using disc diffusion assay was evaluated. The results obtained regarding the inhibition zones were shown in [Table II]() and [Figure 1](). (O. vulgare), tea tree (M. alternifolia), laurel (L. nobilis) and lavender (L. officinalis) are the most effective oils with inhibition zones ranging from 18.25 to 31.50 mm, 22.50 to 28.25 mm, 15 to 29.50 mm, 14 to 18 mm and 27.50 to 31.25 mm, respectively. Mint, eucalyptus and coconut EOs showed no appreciable inhibitory activity against tested human pathogens. Inhibition zone sizes for vancomycin (positive control) showed that the strains were susceptible as expected. Antibacterial activity of analysed EOs. Vancomycin (30\u00b5g/disc) was used as a positive control for inhibition assay. P value less than 0.001 is statistically significant. Mean, Standard Deviation and Range of Zone Diameters (mm) for EOs against S. pyogenes, S. aureus and S. agalactiae. Determination of MIC and MBC Values According to the disc diffusion test results, 5 effective EOs were evaluated of their MIC and MBC against three strains. MIC and MBC results were shown in [Table III](). Oregano EO strongest antibacterial activity with MIC values by tea tree 1.00%, 1.00%(v/v), respectively. Five EOs exhibited bactericidal activity (MBC/MIC:2) against S. aureus. Oregano, cinnamon and tea tree EOs were found bactericidal (MBC/MIC:2) against S .pyogenes. None of the EOs except cinnamon showed bactericidal activity against S. agalactiae. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of EOs (v/v) against S. pyogenes, S. aureus and S. agalactiae strains. FIC and FICI of binary combinations of EOs against bacteria using checkerboard method The results of the FIC and FICI of the dual combinations of EOs studied in this study were presented in [Table IV](). Against S. agalactiae, the more whereas combinations of oregano/laurel (FICI=0.75) exhibited an additive effect and the other EO combinations displayed no interactive effect. Oregano mixed with tea tree (FICI=0.50) and laurel (FICI=0.28) showed a synergistic effect, the other EO combinations exhibited no interactive effect except tea tree/laurel against S. aureus. Combination of lavender with tea tree (FIC=0.31) and cinnamon (FIC=0.28) resulted in synergistic effects against S. pyogenes. Cinnamon EO showed an additive effect when combined with tea tree and laurel (FICI:0.63) EOs, oregano EO exhibited no interactive effect when combined with cinnamon, tea tree and laurel EOs against S. pyogenes. FIC and FICI of the binary combinations of EOs against S.pyogenes, S. aureus and S. agalactiae. DISCUSSION Although a wide range of new antibiotics have been produced in the last thirty years, resistant microorganisms are increased to these drugs. The future of antimicrobial drugs in the treatment of bacterial infections is still uncertain. In traditional medicine, EOs are obtained from plants by various methods (such as hidrodistillation, steam distillation) have been used for a long time. In addition, EOs are used as food preservatives in the food industry, fragrance and pharmaceutical industry (Nascimento et al. 2000NASCIMENTO GG, LOCATELLI J, FREITAS PC & SILVA GL. 2000. Antibacterial activity of plant extracts and 116: 403-406. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2007.12.003. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2007.12.00... ](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2007.12.003)). In this study, 5 of 9 EOs, which were oregano, cinnamon, lavender, tea tree and laurel showed strong antimicrobial activity against S. pyogenes ATCC and S. agalactiae ATCC 12386 strains. The qualitative chemical compositions of these EOs were determined by GC-MS. Carvacrol, -terpinene lavender, 1,8-cineole, -terpinyl acetate, -pinene, -pinene and sabinene in laurel were found as major components of EOs. Al-Bayati (2008)AL-BAYATI FA. 2008.

A study by Zhang et al. (2015)ZHANG LQ, ZHANG ZG, FU Y & XU Y. 2015. Research progress of trans-cinnamaldehyde pharmacological was demonstrated the MIC value of 0.25 \u00b5l/ml and the MBC value of 0.5 \u00b5l/ml were found against S. aureus. These results are similar with ours. In this study, oregano and tea tree (MBC/MIC:2) EOs were found bactericidal against S. pyogenes and S. aureus, and bacteriostatic (MIC: 0.125) against S. agalactiae; lavender and laurel EOs were bactericidal (MBC/MIC:2) against S. aureus, bacteriostatic against S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae strains. In another study; however cinnamon (MBC/MIC: 1.32) and oregano (MBC/MIC: 1.08) were found bactericidal against S. pyogenes, tea tree ve lavender EO showed moderate inhibitory activity (inhibition zone diameter: 9-13 mm) et al.

A lot of studies have reported that EOs consist of 20-60 different chemical components and the antimicrobial activity of some are increased and prolonged against pathogens when used together compared to alone (Chouhan et al. 2017CHOUHAN S, SHARMA K & GULERIA S. 2017.

CONCLUSIONS In this study, the antibacterial efficacy of phytochemical-rich EOs (oregano, cinnamon, tea tree, laurel and lavender) both alone and binary combinations of them against S.pyogenes, S. aureus and S. agalactiae strains were evaluated. Double combinations of EOs exhibited significant synergy and additive effect. In vitro, in vivo (animal studies) and clinical studies are required for the determination of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of EOs and their toxicity. In addition, studies with a large number of clinical isolates need to predict the effective and protective dose (formulation) of EOs. According to the results, various EOs and their binary combinations have shown different effects on different bacterial species. REFERENCES - ABDALLAH EM. 2011.
