Insomnia is relatively common and experienced around the world. Estimates have identified prevalence rates ranging from 5-50%.1 This variation is likely due to cultural differences and vary - ing methodologies used in surveys. Incidences ranging from 20- 38% are most commonly reported.2 A recent survey of U.S. workers found that 23.2% of employees experienced insomnia, contributing to 11 days of lost work annually per person impacted, at an ex - trapolated cost of $63 billion. 3 Another well-designed survey found that 29.9% of Canadian adults experienced insomnia regularly, with 9.5% meeting the criteria for insomnia syndrome. 1 This survey found that 13% of all respondents consulted a health care profes - sional about insomnia, primarily family physicians. Interest in complementary and alternative therapies for sleep dis - orders has been growing over the past two decades.4 The Canadian survey found that 9% of the sample used natural remedies for their insomnia, with more than half of the people taking these remedies at least 3 nights a week. 1 However, the amount and quality of the research evidence available to guide users of herbs and supplements for insomnia remains low.4 Given the relatively high prevalence of insomnia, and the regular use of natural remedies for self-treatment, health care professionals should be aware of the most commonly used \"natural\" sleep remedies and the evidence for their effective - ness and side effects. Valerian By far the most-researched herb for insomnia is valerian. Rem - edies made from Valeriana officinalis have been used for sleeping difficulties since ancient Greek and Roman times. 5 Numerous con - trolled trials of valerian have been conducted and these have been systematically reviewed in recent years. The latest meta-analysis of valerian vs placebo for insomnia identified 18 randomized con - trolled trials (RCTs).6 Studies involving valerian in combination EDITOR Russell H.

The reviewers carried out three separate meta-analyses based on how outcomes were measured. In six studies, sleep quality was measured dichotomously (asking participants if sleep improved or not), and valerian was found to provide significant ben-efit. The relative risk (RR) was 1.37 (95% confidence in - terval [CI], 1.05-1.78). In other words, those taking vale - rian were 1.37 times more likely to have improved sleep quality compared to those taking placebo. However, outcome measurement with insomnia is chal - lenging, especially when considering subjective measure - ments tools like questionnaires. Only two of these four studies used validated methods. Quantitative outcome measures are preferred, such as visual analogue scales (V AS) of sleep quality or latency time (LT) to get to sleep. Ten studies measured outcomes using LT in minutes and meta-analysis found no significant benefit from valeri - an (mean difference of 0.70 min; 95% CI, -3.44-4.83). Seven studies used V AS and likewise found no significant benefit from valerian (mean difference of -0.02; 95% CI, -0.35-0.31). These results are similar to an earlier meta-analysis that identified 16 RCTs of valerian, either with or without other herbs. 7 The most commonly reported outcome mea - surement method was the dichotomous question asking whether sleep improved or not. This showed significant benefit for valerian (RR 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.9). The re - viewers did not carry out a meta-analysis with the other studies because many different outcome measures were used and little statistical data was presented. Overall, they concluded that the quality of the studies was poor, but there was some evidence that valerian may improve sleep quality. Another systematic review identified 37 studies. 8 The authors included more studies in this analysis because they did not exclude studies using valerian along with other herbs (hops, lemon balm, or passion flower) or stud - ies that were not double-blinded (i.e., open-label trials). They did not conduct a meta-analysis because the meth - odology of the trials varied widely and was generally of poor quality. They noted that most studies did not find significant differences between valerian and placebo ei - ther in healthy adults or in those with sleep disturbances or insomnia. Overall, the evidence from larger and higher quality studies does not support the use of valerian for insom-nia. While some studies have found beneficial results, the quality of these studies is low. Several studies also have examined its safety and found that adverse effects are rare and mild. 8 A few cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported, but it is possible that the adverse effects were due to contaminants. A review by the National Toxicol - ogy Program found that valerian could not be shown to be the cause of the liver damage. 9 The most common side effects were dizziness or headache and mild gastrointesti - nal effects. Valerian is thought to have sedative-hypnotic effects, and therefore may have additive effects with other sleeping agents. German Chamomile Chamomile is used for many purposes, including as a natural sleep aid. Many different species are called chamomile, with German, or genuine, chamomile ( Mat- ricaria recutita) most commonly used medicinally. Ro - man, or English, chamomile is an unrelated plant. Ger - man chamomile leaves and flowers can be brewed as a tea or placed under the pillow to aid sleep. One recent survey in Canada found that German chamomile was the most popular herbal sleeping aid. 10 Prior to September 2011, the only reported study of chamomile for insomnia was published in 1973 in which 12 hospitalized heart patients were given a strong cup of chamomile tea (strength not defined). 11 Ten of the patients immediately fell into a deep sleep that lasted 90 minutes. A pilot RCT was recently published involving 34 patients with primary insomnia for at least 6 months. 12 Subjects were randomized to pla - cebo or 270 mg chamomile twice daily for 28 days. No significant differences were found for sleep outcomes as reported in sleep diaries. Secondary outcomes related to daytime functioning also were measured. These favored chamomile, but were not statistically different. Adverse effects did not differ between chamomile and placebo and all were mild and transient. The cause of any seda-tive effects is unknown, with studies having contradictory Alternative Medicine Alert 3 results. While chamomile is commonly used, evidence to guide patients is minimal, but at least side effects are minimal. Melatonin Melatonin is another highly popular supplement for sleeping problems. It became something of a \"wonder drug\" because of its ready availability as a dietary supple - ment for the relief of sleep disturbances due to jet lag and shift-work. 13 At the same time, extensive research was be - ing conducted into its role as an endogenous hormone in - volved in sleep regulation. This led to the identification of melatonin receptors in humans involved in synchronizing circadian rhythms.14 Although much remains unknown about melatonin's mechanism of action, it is not a hyp - notic like benzodiazepines and thus does not have their adverse effects. Clinical trials of melatonin to induce sleep have had mixed results. A 2006 systematic review identified 12 RCTs of melatonin for people with sleep disorders and another 13 trials involving sleep restriction, such as oc - curs with jet lag. 15 Most trials were very small and the re- viewers concluded there was no evidence of effectiveness in either group. The evidence also showed that melatonin was safe with short-term use. However, the design of these trials has been questioned as more has become known about how melatonin works. Healthy volunteers taking melatonin at night, when en - dogenous levels are already highest may not benefit as their receptors may be saturated. Thus, in another trial when melatonin was given in the afternoon, it improved total sleep time before midnight by 2 hours compared to a control group. 16 One meta-analysis included only studies using objec - tive measures of sleep quality and involving people with insomnia who were otherwise healthy. 17 This found that melatonin significantly decreased sleep latency by 3.9 min (95% CI, 2.5-5.4), increased sleep efficiency by 3.1% (95% CI, 0.7-5.5), and increased sleep duration by 13.7 min (95% CI, 3.1-24.3). Doses varied widely between 0.3 and 5 mg daily. Although a subgroup analysis by age was not reported, the reviewers concluded that studies with participants older than 55 years had more beneficial out - comes. Melatonin levels naturally decrease with age. Melatonin has a very short half-life (about 30 min), leading to research into prolonged-release (PR) formula - tions. These appear to show more benefit than melatonin, although a systematic review of PR formulations has not yet been published. 18 The 2010 Consensus Statement of the British Association for Psychopharmacology con - cluded that PR melatonin improves sleeps quality in the elderly when given for 3 weeks.18 A 6-month RCT of 2 mg PR melatonin found significantly reduced sleep la -tency compared to placebo in subjects over 65 years with primary insomnia (19.1 vs 1.7 min; P = 0.002).19 Benefits were apparent at 3 weeks and continued for 6 months. Ad - verse events were similar between groups, with no seri - ous or prolonged side effects. Most of the research on PR melatonin has been conducted on Circadin \u00ae, a registered pharmaceutical in Europe and other countries.19 In the United States, other PR products are available as dietary supplements. In addition, research is being conducted to find more effective melatonin receptor agonists such as agomelatine, tasimelteon, and ramelteon. 14 These are be - ing developed as conventional pharmaceuticals. Lavender Lavender oil is another natural remedy traditionally used to promote sleep. The volatile oil is typically inhaled as a fine mist that is diffused throughout a room via an atomizer and has become popular within aromatherapy. 2 Animal studies support the calming effects of lavender. An early report found that when four older patients on various hypnotic drugs were taken off their medications, their sleep duration decreased. 20 When lavender aroma was introduced into their ward, sleep duration increased significantly (P < 0.05). A pilot study recruited 10 people with insomnia into a single-blind, crossover trial. 21 Sub- jects were randomized to use a vaporizer with lavender oil and then sweet almond oil, or vice versa. Each oil was used for 1 week with a 1-week washout period in between. Using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI, scoring 0 to 21), the average score decreased by 2.5 when subjects inhaled lavender, and didn't change when sweet almond oil was used. Another small trial involved 31 healthy adults aged 18 to 30 years. 22 They spent 3 consecutive nights in a sleep laboratory for adaptation, intervention, and control. Sub - jects laid in bed holding a vial on their chest for 2 min - utes every 10 minutes for a total of 30 minutes. On the second night, half the group had lavender in their vials and the other had distilled water. For the third night, they crossed over. Over the whole night, lavender significantly increased deep sleep time ( P < 0.005) using polysomnog - raphy. With questionnaires, the only significant differ - ence noted was greater vigor upon waking for the laven-der group (P < 0.05). Sleepiness before bedtime was not impacted. The most recent trial involved 67 Taiwanese women who were randomly assigned to receive either lavender aromatherapy for 20 minutes twice weekly for 12 weeks or a sleep hygiene education program as control. 23 Sleep quality was measured with the Chinese PSQI. Over the 12 weeks, those receiving lavender had significantly im - proved CPSQI scores ( P < 0.001), while the control group showed no change. 4 January 2012 Conclusion Natural remedies are increasingly popular as sleep aids. However, the evidence for many of the most popular ones remains limited. A large number of other herbs, such as hops, lemon balm, kava, and passionflower are also used, but have even less evidence to guide decision-makers.2 As noted above, the evidence available for valerian and German chamomile do not support their effectiveness for insomnia, but the herbs are safe and commonly used. The evidence for melatonin is mixed, but as understanding of its underlying mechanism grows, it would appear to be most effective in older people and in people with sleep cycle disturbances. Also, prolonged-released formula-tions are more beneficial, but long-term safety has yet to be established for these. As with many other drugs origi - nally developed from natural products, it would appear that analogues of melatonin may hold the most potential for the future. Inhalation of lavender oil, while having limited evidence, does consistently produce results that support its effectiveness. Recommendation Insomnia can be caused by several health and lifestyle factors, including sleep-disordered breathing and other primary sleep disorders. Careful consideration of these is needed to identify potential contributions to insomnia, including evening food and beverage intake, bedroom TV and lighting, physical activity, etc. Various stress factors should be considered, as well as contributions from oth - er illnesses and side effects from medications. For those with unremitting insomnia, hypnotic drugs remain the most effective intervention. However, given their side ef - fects, especially lingering drowsiness, melatonin or lav-ender inhalation may warrant a trial period. Older people in particular may benefit from prolonged-release melato-nin. The lack of side effects for these natural remedies is particularly attractive. Careful monitoring of sleep quality should be carried out to identify whether the sup- plements are effective or if conventional medications may be necessary. Sleep-promoting herbs are thought to act along a spec - trum of action, from mild to strong, and from very safe to possibly safe. Herbal experts often recommend a step-wise approach to supplement use for insomnia, based on the severity of a patient's symptoms. n References 1. Morin C M, e t a l.

FDA vs HCG Diet Supplements A B S T R A C T A N D C O M M E N T A R Y By David Kiefer, MD Clinical Instructor, Family Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle; Clinical Assistant Professor of Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson; and Adjunct Faculty, Bastyr University, Seattle Dr. Kiefer reports no financial relationships relevant to this field of study. On december 6, 2011, the food and drug administra - tion (FDA) announced that \"HCG products marketed as weight loss aids are unproven and illegal.\"1 Seven let - ters were sent jointly by the FDA and Federal Trade Com - mission (FTC) to companies involved in selling products for that indication. The press release details their concerns about weight loss products with human chorionic gonado - tropin (HCG), which are labeled as \"homeopathic\" and sold in oral drops, pellets, and sprays, and usually are paired with a very low-calorie diet (500 calories daily) in order to help people lose 20-30 pounds in 40 days. The FDA's concerns center on the danger of very low- calorie diets and the significant weight loss that occurs in association with them over such short time frames, espe-cially without medical supervision. Furthermore, HCG is an injectable pharmaceutical, approved for medical con - ditions such as infertility, but not for weight loss; there -fore, an over-the-counter (OTC) use of HCG is illegal. Fi - nally, there is an approved list of homeopathic remedies, and HCG is not one of the constituents on that list, again in violation of the law. Examples of the companies marketing HCG for weight loss are HCG Diet Direct, HCG Platinum, and Nutri Fu - sion Systems. 2 As of the printing of the article, products from these and other HCG companies were still available for sale through online companies and distributors. Label - ing on HCG products includes phrases such as \"Appetite Control and Detox,\" \"Weight Loss Protocol Included\" (referring to the diet and exercise regimens recommend along with the supplement), and \"Weight Loss Formula.\" Some products contain homeopathic HCG (in 6X, 10X, 30X, and 60X) combined with homeopathic amino acids, often dosed as 10 drops three times daily. Another has 910 nanograms of a proprietary combination of HCG amino acids isolates in 10 drops and is dosed 10 drops three times daily. There are many other products using various combinations of amino acids, herbal medi - cines, and other ingredients. In some cases, the proposed mechanism for HCG on weight loss is mentioned on packaging, but in other cases, manufacturers do not detail the effect. HCG's involvement in physiological changes during pregnancy is theorized to promote mobilization and metabolism of stored fat to pro - duce additional energy, thereby leading to weight loss and a resetting of metabolism. n COMMENTARY In the realm of dietary supplements, the FDA and FTC become involved whenever there is an infraction of laws related to supplement labeling or safety (FDA), or adver - tising or Internet information (FTC). As described above there were several aspects of HCG supplements and the HCG diet that crossed over the legal line and led to the December 6, 2011, announcement and reprimand. The FDA press release mentions concerns about safety related to the use of the HCG products specified. It is in - teresting that most of the concerns discussed had to do with the problems of rapid weight loss (i.e., precipita- tion of gallstones) that may occur as a result of the HCG weight loss protocol, not necessarily the HCG products themselves, which the FDA deems to be ineffective; it is the very low-calorie diet that is presumed responsible for the significant weight loss achieved. The focus on adverse effects of dietary supplements is one of the FDA's man - dates. Because of the placement of dietary supplements into the category of food (a result of the 1994 legislation, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act), it is a company's responsibility to assure safety prior to release into the marketplace, and the FDA steps in only when concerns about safety surface, essentially postmarketing 6 January 2012 surveillance. A quick perusal of Internet sites for some of the companies selling HCG products reveals their ap - proach to the issue of safety, with disclaimers strongly encouraging involvement of health care practitioners, di - recting consumers to books for more information (thereby avoiding FTC's concerns about the inappropriate dissemi - nation of online medical information), and, in some cases, no use or mechanistic data whatsoever. It may, therefore, be possible for some companies to claim that they are not providing any protocol, per se, only products that con - sumers will have to figure out how to use by referencing some other source. It will be interesting to see how this aspect of the FDA's concern plays out. Any unknowns about implied use and adverse effects as discussed above vanish with the other two parts of the FDA/FTC complaint. First, HCG is a pharmaceutical with approved uses, none of which are for weight loss; any other use, therefore, is illegal. Micromedex, the phar - maceutical database, states that chorionic gonadotropin is approved for use in adults to treat cryptorchidism, hypo - gonadotropic hypogonadism in males, and ovulation in - duction, whereas a related, recombinant form, chorionic gonadotropin alfa, is used in \"assisted reproductive tech - nology\" and, again, ovulation induction. There are well-established contraindications and a detailed mechanism of action for the above-mentioned indications that do not seem to overlap the weight loss genre. This seems to be a cut-and-dried case of marketing and distribution of a pharmaceutical beyond its FDA-approved uses, an illegal act and one that will probably be hard for companies to circumvent. Unless. Yes, there is an \"unless.\" Companies involved with HCG products may be able to make a case that they are not actually using the pharmaceutical form, an inject - able solution that, interestingly, is a topic of conversation between pleading, overweight patients and, sometimes, suspect physicians. Using subcutaneous or intramuscular HCG would certainly be an off-label use of this drug. In - stead, HCG products on the market are using homeopath - ic HCG, hence the labels that mention 6X, 10X, et cetera, a reference to the fact that the HCG is diluted and shaken (\"percussed\") so much that nary an HCG molecule exists in the remaining solution. Homeopathic medical practi - tioners, and a few research trials, support the efficacy of these \"ultra-dilute\" preparations; in theory, homeopathic HCG might still be able to exert an HCG effect, obtain - ing what consumers want from this hormone, and allow - ing manufacturers to skirt FDA HCG drug regulations. However, here arises the third part of the FDA complaint: It appears that in the official homeopathic compendium, HCG is not mentioned as an allowable homeopathic treat - ment. The FDA may have had the last laugh, as it targets the illegality of even homeopathic HCG forms. So, there are legal technicalities that seem to be the origin behind the current press release and seven certified letters. However, what else might be going on behind the scenes of the HCG diet movement, and whether or not there may be any truth to what these products' manufac - turers, and many of our patients, claim, is a whole other matter. It takes some detective work to compile general themes from the wide variety of HCG manufacturers, as well as track down the origin of specific claims and pos - sible role of co-ingredients, which is beyond the scope of this commentary. Stay tuned for the full HCG treatise in an upcoming issue. n References 1. HCG P roducts A re I llegal. U .S. F ood a nd D rug A dmin - istration. F or C onsumers.

From Data to Conclusions: How Research is Interpreted By Howell Sasser, PhD Scientific Review Coordinator, Manila Consulting Group; Adjunct Member of the Faculty, New York Medical College Dr. Sasser reports no financial relationships relevant to this field of study. This is the final article in a three -part series about the design and conduct of clinical research. The first installment discussed how research begins with the formu - lation of research questions, and the second reviewed the strengths and limitations of some common study designs. This article will discuss a few key issues in the analysis and interpretation of research findings. A basic assumption of the research process is that measuring a characteristic in many people will produce a more stable understanding of nature than will measur - ing that characteristic in only one person. This presents the problem of how best to report information collected from tens or hundreds or thousands of people. Reporting all individual values is impractical and uninformative, so summary measures are used. The ability of a single value to stand in for many de - pends on how the characteristic it represents is concep - tualized. Some things are less easily summarized than Alternative Medicine Alert 7 others. Opinions and thought processes (e.g. \"How does someone choose a chiropractor?\" \"How do one's spiritual beliefs affect one's health practices?\") can be difficult to boil down into one representative answer \u2014 or even into a small number of answers. Research involving questions of this sort is commonly described as qualitative, and has its own set of analytical techniques which are beyond the scope of this article. More common in biomedicine are questions that produce counts (e.g. \"How many nutrition - al supplements does the average person take each day?\" \"On a scale of one to ten, what are patients' pain levels before and after an acupuncture session?\" \"How many ad-ditional pain-free years can a recreational runner with os - teoarthritis expect to gain by taking glucosamine?\"). Re- search involving these questions is commonly described as quantitative, and uses numerical techniques and the \"language\" of statistical testing. Within quantitative research, there are further distinc - tions among characteristics in the way they are conceived, analyzed, and reported. Some characteristics fall naturally into categories \u2014 gender and race, for instance. Others can be grouped in a way that is analytically useful. For ex - ample, in their survey of the prevalence of CAM use and health status, Nguyen and colleagues collect and report participants' health status as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, and Poor. They report age in ranges (18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-64, 65+) that are somewhat arbitrary, but which also have some analytical rationale.1 In other cases, these ranges may be determined by the data themselves. A com-mon approach is to arrange the observed values from low - est to highest, and then divide them evenly into fourths (quartiles) or fifths (quintiles). This method may simplify the analytical process, but it can complicate the com - parison of a study's results with other published findings. Whatever method is used to create them, these categori- cal variables are usually reported as counts and percents. Other characteristics are not as easily grouped or are more appropriately analyzed without the imposition of (perhaps artificial) categories. In such cases, it is necessary to find a single value that is representative of the complete possible range. If the values in a population are normally distributed (that is, follow a bell-shaped curve), the mean or average will be the value that is both at the middle of the range and most commonly observed. The standard de-viation is usually reported with the mean to give a sense of how closely grouped the other values are around the mean. Variables of this type are often referred to as being continuous. When the assumptions necessary for this ap - proach are not met, categorization (as described above) may be used, or the median, the value at the middle of the range, may be reported instead. For example, in their re - port of a randomized trial of Echinacea for cold treatment, Barrett and colleagues found considerable skewness (un - even distribution) of cold severity ratings. To address this, they reported and tested median differences by treatment group as well as mean differences. 2 Continuous and categorical variables each have a num - ber of associated statistical tests that are used in assess-ing the significance of differences in observed values by categories or levels of some other variable. It is impor - tant to note that many tests, especially those used with continuous variables, have underlying assumptions that must be satisfied for the results they produce to be inter - preted correctly \u2014 these are commonly called paramet - ric tests. Often when one or more of these assumptions cannot be met, alternative tests are available \u2014 these are commonly called non-parametric tests. It can be difficult (and at times impossible) for the reader of a journal article to know whether all necessary statistical steps have been done as they should be, so it is all the more important for researchers to have good statistical advice in the design and analysis of their work. It is also important to note that the \"best\" test for any analytical situation may not be the most powerful or sophisticated one, but rather is the one that fits the available data and the assumptions that can or cannot be made about them.

To provide the desired yes/no answer as to statistical significance, they must be judged according to a standard that is both uniform and decided upon in advance. Two common ways of doing this are with the use of p-values and confidence intervals. The interpretation of statistical test results can be seen as the setting up of two opposing propositions: The test result we see is due to chance (the default option); The test result we see is not due to chance (i.e., the difference we observe in some characteristic across the levels of another characteristic really is as it appears). Since either of these propositions may be true, our goal is not to show one or the other to be absolutely certain, but simply sufficiently more likely than the other to remove reasonable doubt. The definition of \"sufficiently more likely\" is straight-forward and mathematical \u2014 for ex - ample, 1 chance in 1000, or 1 chance in 100, or 1 chance in 20. The last option, expressed as a decimal (0.05) is by far the most common standard of improbability. In much of published science, any test result with a probability of less than 0.05 (i.e., 1 in 20) is deemed to be sufficiently extreme to justify rejecting the default assumption of a chance event in favor of the alternate view that the differ - ence in the associated characteristic is really as observed. This probability estimate is referred to as the P value. A second method begins from the observation that most characteristics can take on a value from a finite number of possibilities. Once that range is defined, it becomes pre - dictive. For example, if we measured the heights of 1000 men, and calculated the minimum and maximum values, we could be fairly certain that the height of any additional man would also fall within that range. For characteristics of interest in research, and also for the results of statistical tests, the range of values \u2014 called the confidence interval \u2014 can be calculated if we have some basis for estimat - ing the likely variability in the thing being measured. The overlap of confidence intervals, and the presence within them of values defined as indicating \"no difference,\" is interpreted in a way that is parallel to P values. Discussion of statistical significance leads logically to the topic of study power. Since we usually cannot capture an entire population (i.e., every woman with breast cancer or every person who takes garlic supplements), we use a sample. The larger the sample, the greater the chance that we will measure accurately the characteristics of the population is represents. However, practical concerns compel us to keep study samples within limits that are manageable and affordable. Calculations for study power and sample size tell us how large a sample is needed to meet two needs: 1) to ensure that if our study hypothesis is in fact false, we will not mistakenly conclude that it is correct (also called avoidance of \"Type I\" error), and 2) to ensure that if our study hypothesis is in fact correct, we will show it to be so (also called avoidance of \"Type II\" error). It is common practice to choose a sample size that allows no more than a 5% chance of a Type I error (this is the origin of near-universal < 0.05 threshold for P values), and no more than a 20% chance of a Type II error. The methods and equations associated with esti - mating power and sample size are sophisticated enough to require expert advice. Although these details may seem arcane, the under - lying points that they support can \u2014 and should \u2014 be expressed simply. Statistics and statistical tests are based in and flow from the actual data collected in the study. Because they are interpreted in much the same way by everyone, they permit the comparison of findings across studies. Because they play a role in what data will be collected, how those data will be collected, and how the questions that drive a study are answered, analytical and statistical details are important elements of study design from the very beginning. This discussion of quantitative methods is important for an understanding of the later phases of a research proj - ect, but it should not distract from the goal it is intended to serve \u2014 the production of clinically and scientifically relevant information. Statistical significance should not be confused with clinical significance. It is possible to produce results that are statistically significant but practi - cally irrelevant \u2014 this sometimes happens in very large studies. It is equally possible to produce findings that are statistically non-significant but of great clinical impor - tance \u2014 this sometimes happens in very small studies.

Greenfield, MD, Editor Synopsis: Results from this small pilot trial suggest that clinical hypnosis, massage, and energy work can all be offered to people receiving chemotherapy without interfering with conventional medical care. The find - ings also suggest little clinical benefit, but there are considerable study limitations, and the findings speak more to feasibility than to therapeutic utility. Source: Judson PL, et al. A prospective, randomized trial of integrative medicine for women with ovarian cancer. Gynecol Oncol 2011;123:346-350. In a prospective , randomized controlled pilot trial performed at the University of Minnesota, researchers sought to assess the feasibility of providing integrative medical care (IM) to women receiving treatment for gy - necologic malignancy. Women were eligible to participate if they had newly diagnosed ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma at any stage or histology, and were scheduled to receive at least six cycles of chemo - therapy. Those subjects randomized to the control group received standard treatment for nausea and vomiting, and bone marrow support. While not prohibited, they were also encouraged not to seek complementary and alterna - tive medical (CAM) therapies. Women randomized to the IM group received clinical hypnosis, massage therapy, and healing touch at the time of administration of chemother - apy. Participation in support groups was freely permitted. Clinical hypnosis was performed three times in the presence of a hypnotherapist (chemotherapy cycles 1, 2, and 4). These sessions were recorded and patients were given headsets to listen to them whenever they desired and at chemotherapy cycles 3, 5, and 6. Prior to the first hypnosis session, subjects were given a pamphlet describ - ing the therapy, and subjects were asked to identify their major concerns and ways they thought such concerns might be quelled. The content of the hypnosis sessions were then semi-structured to the individual's needs. The initial session lasted 60 minutes, all others were 30 min - utes in duration, and afterwards the subject's experience with hypnosis was evaluated. Therapeutic massage was administered with each cycle of chemotherapy for 30 minutes, using the same provider, with the patient resting in a chemotherapy recliner. Stan - dard manual massage techniques were individualized and employed over the head, neck, shoulders, back, hands and/or feet. Healing touch was delivered following massage ther - apy. Prior to the first session a handout describing heal - ing touch was given to participants in the active group. Treatment was provided by one healing touch practitioner who was certified in the practice. Sessions were tailored to patients' needs and lasted 30 minutes. At each chemotherapy visit subjects underwent per - formance assessment and laboratory testing that included immune parameters such as white blood cell count with differential, T and B-cell count, salivary IgA levels, and NK cell count. Quality of life was assessed prior to che - motherapy cycles 1, 3, and 6, as well as 6 months after che - motherapy was completed, using the FACT-O and Mental Health Inventory. Information on delays in chemotherapy protocol, infection rate, re-hospitalization rate, and anti - emetic use was collected prospectively. Demographic and disease stage information were also collected. A total of 43 women with ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer were recruited into the study, with 20 randomized to the control arm. The groups were comparable at baseline on the basis of demographics and disease state. One patient withdrew consent prior to re - ceiving any treatment and was removed from analysis. Multimodality IM was deemed both feasible and ac - ceptable to all the women enrolled in the active arm. Each received the full slate of interventions in their che - motherapy chairs. The IM interventions did not interfere with the delivery of chemotherapy. Average FACT-O and MHI survey scores revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups at any time point. Save for some immune function measurements, no differences were found between the groups for any of the other pa - rameters being followed. WBC counts were no different between groups, but compared to controls, participants receiving multimodal IM had consistently higher CD4, CD8, and NK cell counts at each cycle of chemotherapy. The differences were not statistically significant.10 January 2012 The authors concluded that offering combined IM ther - apies to women receiving chemotherapy for gynecologic malignancies is feasible and well-tolerated, but may not offer clinically important effects on quality of life as pre - supposed. n COMMENTARY Women being treated for ovarian cancer report high levels of depression and anxiety. Many turn to CAM ther - apies for relief, and some trials have reported benefits on measures of emotional and physical well-being, and even on measures of immune modulators in some trials. Some consider the addition of CAM therapies to the conven - tional medical armamentarium equivalent to integrative care. It is not. There are many ways that integrative medicine can be defined, but perhaps the most accepted definition comes out of the Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona: \"Healing-oriented medicine that takes account of the whole person (body, mind, and spirit), including all aspects of lifestyle. It emphasizes the therapeutic relationship and makes use of all appropriate therapies, both conventional and alternative.\" There are other important tenets, including that good medicine is based in good science, is inquiry-driven, and is open to new paradigms. But another central theme is individual-ization of care, and that's a major concern with this paper. The authors of this well-done trial sought primarily to assess the feasibility of providing a preset combination of CAM therapies (clinical hypnosis, massage therapy, and healing touch/energy work) to patients in and around the time of administration of chemotherapy. They succeeded in showing that such an approach could be offered with - out interfering with conventional care and in a manner that was acceptable to participants. Keeping in mind the small sample size, the authors' assertion that the study was inadequately powered to determine the clinical impact of their multimodality CAM approach, and the lack of blind - ing, the conclusion that some will nonetheless glom onto is that little or no clinical benefit is associated with an \"integrative oncology\" approach. Consider, however, that three separate forms of care were offered at each chemo - therapy session, and none (except for the opportunity to listen to hypnosis tapes) in between sessions. Consider that in a truly integrative approach the needs of the indi - vidual would determine whether or not hypnosis, massage therapy, and/or healing touch would be recommended at all. Consider that in reality many, if not most, patients re - ceive the majority of CAM treatments before or after the date of chemotherapy administration, or that receiving three separate forms of care together with chemotherapy might be stressful and time-consuming for some. Lastly, consider that diet and lifestyle measures, the centerpiece of integrative care, were not the centerpiece of care. A combined offering of preset CAM therapies to peo - ple on the day they are to receive chemotherapy is unique and potentially beneficial, but in and of itself does not set the standard for integrative oncology, where a given ap - proach is decided upon and utilized based on the individ - ual nature of the patient and her needs. The study was very well done and shows that clini- cal hypnosis, massage, and energy work can be offered to patients, combined or separately, in the infusion center without disrupting care. The findings cannot reasonably be used to determine the clinical utility of this combina - tion of therapies due to the shortcomings readily stated by the researchers, nor should it be used to judge integrative oncology as a whole. Grafting a set of CAM therapies onto the conventional medical treatment of cancer is not synonymous with integrative medicine. n MOTIVE-ation! A B S T R A C T & C O M M E N T A R Y By Allan J.

Behavioral versus drug treatment for overactive bladder in men: The Male Overactive Bladder Treat - ment in Veterans (MOTIVE) Trial. J Am Geriatr Soc 2011;Nov 7. doi: 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03724.x [Epub ahead of print]. Burgio and colleagues enrolled 203 male veterans (out of 360 assessed for eligibility), attending two V A Medical Centers in Alabama and Georgia, in this random - ized, controlled equivalence trial of behavioral therapy (BEH) vs extended-release oxybutynin (OBN) for over - active bladder (OAB). All subjects underwent a clinical evaluation, which included urinalysis, urodynamic test - ing, post void residual volume (PVR) determination by ultrasound, and kept a voiding diary. They took the alpha-blocker tamsulosin 0.4 mg/d 4-week run-in pe -Alternative Medicine Alert 11 riod and continued it throughout the study. Inclusion cri - teria were self-reported urgency, frequent urination, and > 8 voids/day. Exclusion criteria were recent urological surgery, bed-bound, urine flow rate < 5 mL/s at baseline or < 10 mL/s after run-in, PVR > 250 mL at baseline or > 150 mL after run-in, continuous urine leakage, urinary tract infection, hematuria, fecal impaction, diabetes mel - litus in poor control, unstable medical condition, demen - tia, narrow-angle glaucoma, gastric retention, hypersensi - tivity to the study drugs, new onset diuretic therapy, and sleep apnea. The subjects in the behavioral arm were seen by nurse practitioners (NPs) for a comprehensive training program. The NPs taught them how to contract and relax their pel- vic floor muscles. They were also instructed on the tech - niques of delayed voiding and urinary urge suppression. Nocturia was specifically addressed. The BEH group was told to restrict their fluid intake after 6 p.m. They were taught that if they awoke with the urge to void, they were to lie in bed and try to suppress the urgency by contracting their pelvic floor muscles. Subjects in the drug-therapy arm were started on extend - ed-release oxybutynin 10 mg daily. The dose was titrated upward or downward at follow-up visits, depending on pa - tient tolerance of side effects and whether PVR was greater than 150 mL, which would trigger a dose reduction. The trial lasted 10 weeks. The primary outcome was the average number of voids in a 24-hour period. Second - ary outcome measures included patient global ratings, ratings of activity restriction, and measures of how dis - turbing the symptoms and side effects of the treatment were. The subjects were also asked whether they wanted to continue their present therapy or receive another form of treatment. After the alpha-blocker run-in, 143 of the 203 men who were enrolled continued to have OAB symptoms, 73 randomized to BEH and 70 to OBN. Nineteen subjects dropped out, 9 from BEH and 10 from OBN. The aver - age age of the participants was 64 years (range 42-88), 64% were white, 35% black, and 1% Hispanic. Subjects in BEH reduced their daily voids from an average of 11.3 at baseline to 9.1 at the end of the trial (normal < 8.) Simi- larly, subjects in the oxybutynin arm reduced their voids from 11.5 to 9.5. Both of these results were statistically significant. Before treatment, subjects in the behavioral arm averaged 2.2 episodes of nocturia per night vs 2.3 for subjects in OBN. Subjects in the behavioral arm had greater reduction in the number of nocturia episodes com - pared to the drug group (0.7 vs 0.32); this was statisti - cally significant. When the investigators looked at mean urgency scores, OBN subjects had a statistically sig - nificant reduction compared to BEH. There was greater patient satisfaction among men in BEH, but this did not reach statistical significance. There were fewer men who complained of bothersome side effects in the behavioral group than the drug therapy group (12.6% vs 28.8%) and fewer wanted to change therapy (29.0% vs 50.0%). Both of these were statistically significant. n COMMENTARY As these investigators define it, OAB is urinary urgen - cy, urge incontinence, frequency, and nocturia. Nocturia, which is often associated with urinary frequency, is de - fined as an urge to urinate that awakens the person dur - ing the night. OAB is usually thought of as a syndrome that afflicts females. However, 17% of males older than 60 years in the United States suffer from it. 1 Although alpha-blockers commonly are associated with relaxation of the prostatic and bladder neck smooth muscles, they also relax the bladder dome smooth muscle, which accounts for their efficacy in OAB. Antimuscarinic drugs inhibit the muscarinic receptors that mediate normal bladder contractions. 2 The oxybutynin-tamsulosin com - bination previously has been shown to be more effective than tamsulosin by itself, 3 although, as was shown in the run-in period of this study, tamsulosin by itself was effec - tive for 60 men (30% of those enrolled). Like other anti - muscarinic drugs, oxybutynin can cause serious reactions, such as heat stroke and psychosis. However, there are many common reactions (dry mouth, dizziness, constipa - tion, etc.) that are bothersome enough for patients to aban - don therapy. Ironically, one of the most common reactions is urinary retention, which is why these investigators were using PVR for monitoring the subjects who were using drug therapy. Normal PVR is less than 100 mL. Pelvic floor muscle strengthening (also known as Kegel exercises) works on the pubococcygeal muscle and other pelvic diaphragm muscles. Although primarily known as treatment for female stress incontinence, Kegel exercises also have been used in men for incontinence following prostate surgery 4 and for premature ejaculation.5 To my knowledge, there are no adverse effects of performing Kegel exercises. The main problem in prescribing this therapy likely will be convincing the patient to allow a NP to place a finger into his anus, which is how the NP will teach him to recognize which muscles to contract. This study raises some questions. It was of brief dura - tion. How long-lasting will the results be? The main limi - tation of this study was that it was conducted on men who were already taking an alpha-blocker, tamsulosin. Would a different alpha-blocker (terazosin, doxazosin, etc.) work as well? Would the results of the study have been the same if the subjects had not been taking an alpha-blocker? The investigators used extended-release oxybutynin with the patients in the drug-therapy arm. Would much cheaper, short-acting oxybutynin have been What about Extended-release tolt- erodine in combination with tamsulosin has also been 12 January 2012 shown to be effective.6 The bottom line is this: Medication works for OAB, but behavioral therapy was as good as, if not better than, drug therapy for all outcome measures except urgency. The side effects of BEH are minimal, if not nonexistent. Antimuscarinic drugs have nontrivial side effects. Con - sider BEH and an alpha-blocker, unless urgency is the pa- tient's overriding concern and he is willing to put up with the expense and side effects of oxybutynin. n References 1.
