Mental health disorders affect children and teens more often than many parents realize. Statistics show that 50% of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin by the age of 14. Edmond Sarraf, MD, at Southern California Integrative Wellness Center evaluates children for mental health concerns, determines the underlying cause of the problem, then offers natural treatments as alternatives to medications.

Over the last two decades, mental health experts have learned that disorders once believed to only affect adults also develop in children and teens. Many of these conditions also appear at a very young age. For example, one in six children between the ages of two and eight are diagnosed with a mental, behavioral, or developmental disorder. Children and teens may develop many different conditions, including: - ADHD - Anxiety - Autism - Depression - Bipolar disorder - Conduct disorder - Oppositional defiant disorder - Obsessive-compulsive disorder - Post-traumatic stress disorder It's also common for children to have comorbid conditions, making their symptoms and behaviors more difficult and confusing. Nearly 50% of children with ADHD also have a mental health disorder such as depression or anxiety. Additionally, 75% of children with depression also have anxiety and behavioral disorders.
