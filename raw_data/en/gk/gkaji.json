Try these home remedies to naturally increase your breast milk supply. By Andrew Weil, MD Updated on August 16, 2023 Medically reviewed by Yamel Belen, R.N., IBCLC Breastfeeding or chestfeeding provides plenty of benefits for you and your baby, but it doesn't always come naturally. Some parents worry they're not producing enough breast milk to sustain their little one. After all, it's not easy to track your milk production and your baby's intake. If your child is growing, sleeping, eating, and needing diaper changes on a regular schedule, then you're probably making enough milk. But sometimes your supply really could use a boost\u2014especially if you're hoping to pump extra milk for storage, or you want to ensure your supply keeps pace with your growing baby's needs. In situations like this, there are several ways produce more breast milk. Keep reading to learn about 12 home remedies and natural solutions. 4 Things That Can Decrease Your Milk Supply Are You Producing Enough Breast Milk? For starters, it helps to know if your breast milk supply could use a boost. Your body will likely make enough milk to meet your baby's nutritional needs. Here are several signs that you are, in fact, producing enough breast milk: Your baby is swallowing during feedingsThey seem full, tired, or content when they're done with feedingThey're making regular wet and dirty diapersYour baby is growing and gaining healthy weight Crying and fussiness after feedings isn't usually related to hunger, so don't worry about milk supply in these cases. Instead, try to find the underlying cause, which could be teething, gas, or other health concerns. Keep in mind, too, your baby's pediatrician will check their growth at each check-up. If you have concerns about low breast milk supply, don't hesitate to ask for support and discuss your options. When To Expect Your Breast Milk To Come In Getty Images / skaman306 How to Increase Breast Milk Supply Boosting your breast milk supply at home typically begins with nipple stimulation and increased milk removal. But you also need to address the most common causes of low milk supply, such as not eating and drinking enough, feeling fatigued, being stressed, and nursing too infrequently. Read on to learn more home remedies for increasing your breast milk production naturlaly. 1. Eat a nutritious diet Following a healthy diet plan, like an anti-inflammatory diet or the Mediterranean diet, can ensure you're getting proper nutrition. Choose meals heavy on fruits and vegetables, whole grains like brown rice, foods rich in omega-3s like salmon and flaxseeds, and vegetable proteins. Most breastfeeding people aim for about 2,000 to 2,800 calories per day, but your health care provider can give you more definitive advice since your specific caloric needs will vary based on your height, weight, metabolism, and physical activity. 2. Drink plenty of water Your body can't produce more breast milk if you're dehydrated. Plus, you need more water than you probably think when nursing. People who are breastfeeding should drink an extra eight cups of water a day, in addition to the recommended eight, 8-ounce glasses per day for adults. One way to ensure you're getting enough fluids is to drink a glass of water with every meal and nursing session. Likewise, you can try eating foods that contain a lot of water like watermelon, cucumbers, and berries to help you stay hydrated. 3. Sleep whenever possible Get restorative sleep as often as possible and nap during the day when the baby is sleeping. (That saying about sleeping when the baby sleeps is not just an old wives' tale!) Getting enough rest helps your body to recover from pregnancy and childbirth\u2014and prompts your body to produce more breast milk. Meanwhile, the lack of sleep can negatively impact your milk production, so it's important to prioritize sleep as much as you can. How Often Should You Pump? 4. Find ways to stress less Learning to breastfeed can be challenging, and it's understandable to feel stressed about your breast milk supply. But being chronically stressed can impact your milk production\u2014especially when you have lots of body processes competing for limited resources. Regularly practice healthy stress-reduction techniques and activities, such as breath work, yoga, light exercise, talking with friends, self-care, and relaxation. Also, be patient with yourself as you work on building up your breast milk production. 5. Delegate what you can Feel free to let go of household chores. Caring for your baby and yourself, including making time for calming activities, is more important than whether the dishes or laundry are done. You can also ask for help with household duties from friends, family, or cleaning services. Ordering takeout on occasion can also help you save energy. Research shows that when breastfeeding parents don't have a support system, their success with breastfeeding dwindles. 6. Breastfeed often Breastfeeding works on a supply-and-demand system. What does this mean? The more often and the longer your baby latches on to suck, the more milk you'll produce. If you're having trouble getting comfortable or finding a position that works, a lactation consultant can teach you the proper techniques. You also should plan to feed your baby pretty consistently\u2014especially in those first few weeks. Expect to breastfeed every two to four hours around the clock. If this time has passed since your last feeding, you should consider waking your baby up to feed (though you can stop this practice as they grow, based on recommendations from your health care provider). Also, make sure to breastfeed from both sides! Everything You Need to Know About Breast Milk Color 7. Talk to a health care provider about herbal remedies Some health practitioners swear by herbal remedies such as fenugreek and ginger to boost milk production. Fenugreek is available both as an herb, which can be made into a tea, and a supplement. People have long used fenugreek to produce more breast milk, but there are limited studies on its safety for both parent and baby. There's also some evidence that ginger may increase milk production. Consider chopping or grating fresh ginger into some of your favorite dishes or making tea out of it. Ginger is even available in oils, capsules, tinctures, and extracts. While there is a rich history of use for these agents, there have been only a few human studies on their safety and effectiveness. Be sure to check with your health care provider and your baby's pediatrician before using any supplements. 13 Best Foods for Breastfeeding Parents 8. Try breast compression Breast compression involves using your hand to manually massage and compress your breast in order to remove milk. This technique is useful if your breasts are engorged and you need to remove some breast milk, but you can also use it when you have a sleepy baby who isn't effective at nursing yet. Try gently compressing your breast while your baby is feeding to keep the milk flowing. Of course, this approach will take some trial and error\u2014especially since you don't want to express more milk than your baby can handle. If you prefer, you could try hand expressing your milk once your baby has finished eating and storing it for later use. The more milk you release at a time, the more your body will produce for the next feeding. 9. Consider limiting caffeine If you find that you need to produce more breast milk, you can also make a few simple lifestyle changes like reducing the amount of caffeine you consume. While caffeine may not directly impact your breast milk supply, its impact on you\u2014and your baby\u2014could lead to milk supply issues. For instance, caffeine is a natural diuretic, which means it could lead to dehydration if you drink too much. Likewise, your baby may refuse to nurse if you drink too much caffeine. And having too much coffee or soda could impact your sleep, which in turn can alter your milk supply. In fact, one study found that drinking caffeine six hours before bed reduced total sleep time by one hour. While you don't have to completely eliminate coffee from your diet, you may want to limit it while trying to increase your milk production. 10. Massage your breasts Massaging your breasts between feedings also may help you produce more breast milk. For instance, one study found that using circular breast massage increased the amount of breast milk produced by nearly 23%. It also is useful in decreasing breast pain and swelling. To massage your breasts, you want to choose a comfortable and quiet place with soft music. You can start by placing warm washcloths on the breasts. Then, place one hand on top of a breast and place the other hand below the breast. Gently massage back and forth, moving your hands in opposite directions. If you find that your hands don't move as well across your skin as you might like, you can use a small amount of olive oil to promote movement. 11. Use a breast pump While it may seem counterintuitive at first, pumping or expressing milk frequently between nursing sessions can increase your milk supply. Many first-time parents worry that pumping will deplete milk for their baby, but your body will simply produce more. Talk to your health care provider or a lactation consultant to determine when you should start pumping. 12. Work with a lactation consultant A lactation consultant can teach you techniques and positions for nursing your little one. Often, simple, slight shifts in your baby's latch and how you hold them can make a world of difference. Your baby's pediatrician and other nursing parents can also offer helpful guidance. The key is that you reach out for help early rather than waiting until the situation seems insurmountable. Making little changes here and there can help you build a milk supply that nourishes your baby and meets your needs for storage. What Parents Really Need for Lactation Support Was this page helpful?
