Institute for Research and 2 No. 1 (2019): Borneo Journal of Pharmacy eng Copyright (c) Silico Study to Assess Antibacterial Activity from Cladophora Sp. Increasing antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria is a severe problem in the world. Therefore, there is a need to identify new drugs from natural products and also new drug targets. Cladophora sp. is a marine organism which is known to have bioactive compounds and a potential antibacterial. On the other hand, Peptide Deformylase (PDf) may prove to be a novel drug target since it is crucial for native peptide functioning in most pathogenic bacteria. This study screens for PDf inhibition activity of compounds from Cladophora sp. using molecular docking approach and screening the binding affinity of bioactive compounds against the peptide receptor PDf using Pyrex Autodock Vina software. Docking results were stored and visualized using Biovia Discovery Studio and PyMOL ligand. Ligands were obtained from previous literature in PubChem, PDf was obtained from the peptide data bank. The results of this screening show with ligand the highest binding affinity against PDf of P. aeruginosa, E. coli, E. faecium, and S. aureus respectively. The binding of natural compounds from Cladophora sp. with PDf models may provide a new drug with a different drug target for antibacterial potential.

Prior studies have been conducted to observe the effect of E. elatior as an immunomodulator, thus further study is needed to observe the production of cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6 which are responsible for the immune responses. Etlingera elatior fruit macerated with 96% ethanol for three days and produced a total of \u00b174.6 g concentrated extract. Experimental animals used were divided into four groups (n=4) and treated orally once a day for seven days as follows: group I (0.5% Na CMC); group II (Stimuno\u00ae); group III (E. elatior fruit extract dose of 300 mg/kg BW); and group IV (E. elatior fruit extract dose of 400 mg/kg BW). On the eight-day, animals were infected with Staphylococcus aureus intraperitoneally and left for an hour. Thereafter, blood was collected and assayed using ELISA Kit (Elabscience rat IL-1 and Elabscience rat IL-6). Results demonstrated that group IV increased levels of IL-1 and group III and IV increased level of IL-6 (p<0.05). Increased levels of IL-1 and IL-6 are associated with phagocytosis in the immune response. In conclusion, E. elatior fruit extract at doses of 300 and 400 mg/kg BW increases levels of IL-1 and IL-6.

Carbapenems are the only -lactam antibiotics with efficacy in severe infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria. However, recent reports of carbapenem resistance particularly among members of Enterobacteriaceae that are responsible for diseases such as gastrointestinal infections, septicemia, pneumonia, meningitis, peritonitis as well as urinary tract infections, call for concerns. In Africa, the problem of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is aggravated by factors such as the high rate of infections, poor diagnostic tools, sub-optimal disease surveillance, and abuse of antibiotics. Besides, the problem of CRE in Africa is understudied. This review distills available literature on the spread of CRE in Africa, CRE genes in circulation, and the need to pay attention to this emerging threat to lives in developing countries.

Hypertension is a common disease comorbidity among T2DM patients, and often those patients received polypharmacy and complex treatment in long term duration. This condition may lead to an increased risk of drug therapy problems (DTPs). This study aimed to assess and determine potential drug therapy problems in type 2 diabetic patients with hypertension comorbidity. Retrospective cross-sectional design was conducted in a hospital setting, especially data sources from the prescription of ambulatory T2DM patients with hypertension. A total of 190 patients were studied. More than half of the participants were female (53.68%). The majority age range of participants was 50-59 years (46.84%). Almost all antidiabetic agents were prescribed as polypharmacy (73.16%). Metformin was the most antidiabetic agent prescribed as monotherapy and combination therapy (63.16%). Almost all antihypertensive agents were prescribed as polypharmacy (63.26%). Amlodipine was the most antihypertensive agent prescribed as monotherapy and combination therapy (34.74%). Among the study participants, 56.84% have at least one of DTPs. Adverse drug reaction was the most frequent (47.22%), followed by ineffective drug therapy (29.63%). Since the potential of DTPs in T2DM patients with hypertension comorbidity is relatively high, early identifying, resolving, and preventing drug therapy problems by the pharmacist is needed to achieve goals of treatment.

The virus first originated in the city of Wuhan in China, causing symptoms such as pneumonic plague, which began in the Wuhan and then spread throughout the world with high transmission efficiency. Special precautions and care are needed such as leaving the public area, covering your mouth with a mask, not shaking hands, washing hands, and sanitation from time to time. Infection due to SARS-CoV-2 shows several symptoms, one of which is very often the patient shows difficulty breathing. Currently, COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic and has almost attacked all countries in the world, including in India which has one of the largest human populations in the entire world. One of the challenges in handling COVID-19 is the unavailability of drugs or special vaccines to treat the disease, so clinical practitioners and academics are currently testing various drugs to see how they affect the COVID-19 patients. Some of the drugs tested provide effective mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2, such as chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir, and vaccines under development. These drugs are still being tested and are now at the forefront to combat the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review article will discuss all kinds of ins and outs of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, including the transmission method, how to prevent it, as well as various drugs and vaccines currently used in handling COVID-19.

The problem of urinary stones is very ancient; these stones are found in all parts of the urinary tract, kidney, ureters, and the urinary bladder and may vary considerably in size. It is a common disease estimated to occur in approximately 12% of the population, with a recurrence rate of 70-81% in males and 47-60% in females. The treatment of kidney and urinary stone diseases such as a western (allopathy) medicine and surgery is now in trends. However, most people preferred plant-based (herbal) therapy because of the overuse of allopathic drugs, which results in a higher incidence rate of adverse or severe side effects. Therefore, people every year turn to herbal therapy because they believe plant-based medicine is free from undesirable side effects, although herbal medicines are generally considered to be safe and effective. In the present article, an attempt has been made to emphasize an herbal therapy is better than allopathic therapy for the management of the kidney and urinary stone disease.

Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors are G protein-coupled receptors present from the early stages of gestation, which is involved in various physiological processes, including appetite, pain-sensation, mood, and memory. Due to the lipophilic nature of cannabinoids, it was initially thought that these compounds exert several biological effects by disrupting the cell membrane nonspecifically. Recent biochemical and behavioral findings have demonstrated that blockade of CB1 receptors engenders antidepressant-like neurochemical changes (increases in extracellular levels of monoamines in cortical but not subcortical brain regions) and behavioral effects consistent with antidepressant/antistress activity. We aim to define various roles of cannabinoid receptors in modulating signaling pathways and association with several pathophysiological conditions.

However, limited information is available on their bioactivities. In the present study, the antioxidant, antidiabetic, and anti-obesity potential of I. reptans leaves were investigated. Different fractions (ethanol, ethyl acetate, and hexane) of I. reptans leaves were evaluated for their scavenging activity on DPPH radicals, whereas their reducing potential was investigated by cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CuPRAC), total antioxidant, and reducing power assays. The antidiabetic potential was investigated by their inhibition effect on -glucosidase. Total phenolic and flavonoid contents of I. reptans leaves were solvent dependent. Ethyl acetate contained the highest phenolic content, followed by ethanol and hexane fractions. However, for flavonoid content, the order was ethanol > ethyl acetate > hexane. All fractions showed DPPH scavenging activity in a concentration-dependent manner, with activities weaker than standards ascorbic acid and BHT, in the order of ethanol > ethyl acetate > hexane. All fractions showed reducing capacity, but only hexane and ethanol fractions of I. reptans leaves showed inhibition on -glucosidase, with hexane showed more potent inhibition compared to acarbose. The study also found that fractions of I. reptans inhibit lipase and trypsin, enzymes related to lipid metabolism.

This study aims to identify the physical interactions between glimepiride and metformin HCL using a thermal analysis of Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and then confirmed by a computational approach. Identifying the physical interactions between glimepiride and metformin HCL was carried out by plotting the melting points generated from the endothermic peaks of the DSC thermogram at various compositions versus the mole ratios of the two were further confirmed by the computational approach using PatchDock. The results of the phase diagram analysis of the binary system between glimepiride and metformin HCl show a congruent pattern, which indicates the formation of co-crystal or molecular compounds at a 1 : 1 mole ratio at 228\u00b0C. Computational approach results showed that the interaction between glimepiride and metformin HCl did not form new compounds but heterosinton formation that was stable in molecular dynamics simulations.

On the other hand, natural antioxidants show their superiority as they are not or less toxic. Passiflora foetida has the potential as an antioxidant, but the investigation of the antioxidant activity of the P. foetida chromatography column fraction has not been reported. This studied aims to investigate the antioxidant activity of the column chromatographic fractions of P. foetida leaves. An antioxidant assay using the DPPH and FRAP methods. The extraction was carried out by graded maceration, then fractionation using column chromatography. The antioxidant activity test was carried out using the DPPH and FRAP methods. Thin Layer Chromatography analysis was performed to determine the chromatogram pattern. The using Column chromatography fractions have antioxidant activity, with FMetPF6 as the fraction with the best activity, with percent inhibition 41.85\u00b11.96 at concentration 25 \u00b5g/mL (DPPH), and with 26.03\u00b10.84 at concentration 9 \u00b5g/mL (FRAP). Passiflora foetida leaves have great potential as an antioxidant; both the extract and its fractions have antioxidant activity. The FMetPF6 has the best activity compare to other extracts and fractions. Further analysis to determine the various compounds in FMetPF6 using LC-MS/MS will facilitate the active compound's isolation.

This research aims to provide a reference for alternative testing methods in testing the products of traditional powder preparations on the market. The sample consisted of 10 traditional powder preparations spiked with positive control of S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 phase 2. The method used in the study was real-time PCR analysis using the SYBR\u00ae Green method, while DNA isolation using the direct PCR method. Data analysis was performed by analyzing the sample's melting temperature (Tm) curve and comparing it with positive control. The results showed that S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 was detected in samples at an average Tm value of 84.18\u00b0C, with ranges of 84.0-84.5\u00b0C. For positive control, the Tm value was at 85.2\u00b0C, while for the negative control, the Tm value was not detected. Based on these data, it can be concluded that S. typhimurium ATCC 14028 in traditional medicine products powder preparations can be detected using real-time PCR. Institute for Research and 4 No. 3 (2021): Borneo Journal of 2621-4814 dc Formulation and Evaluation of Sustained Release Matrix Tablets of Aceclofenac Singh, Priyanka Sardar Patel College of Pharmacy http://sppharmacy.in/ Dhar Sardar Patel College of Pharmacy http://sppharmacy.in/ https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7697-9302 This study aimed to improve the dissolution rate of aceclofenac and release the drug in a controlled manner over a period of 24 hours. Matrix tablets were prepared by direct compression method, using hydrophilic polymers (HPMC/guar gum). Matrix tablets were prepared by wet granulation method using different hydrophilic polymers (HPMC/guar gum). Tablets were evaluated for in vitro drug release profile in phosphate buffer with pH 6.8 (without enzymes). The thickness and hardness of prepared tablets were 3.23 \u00b1 0.035 to 3.28 \u00b1 0.200 kg/cm2, respectively. The friability was within the acceptable limits of pharmacopoeial specifications (0.31 to 0.71%), which indicates the good mechanical strength of the tablets. Drug release was retarded with an increase in polymer concentration due to the gelling property of polymers. The in vitro drug release from the proposed system was best explained by Higuchi's model, indicating that drug release from tablets displayed a diffusion-controlled mechanism. The results clearly indicate that guar gum could be a potential hydrophilic carrier in developing oral controlled drug delivery systems. Based on the study results, formulations F8 was selected as the best formulation. Institute for Research and Community Services 4 No. 2 (2021): Borneo Journal of Pharmacy "}
