The customer purchasing a product should be able to locate the security label without having to open the packaging. For large volume parenteral products (LVP) defined as containers labelled as containing more than 100mL [based on the United States Pharmacopeia (USP)], the security label shall be affixed on the immediate label of each unit of the product. On the other hand, it is sufficient for the security label to be affixed to the outer carton / unit of sale for small volume parenteral (SVP) products [defined as packaged in containers and labelled as containing 100mL or less [based on the United States Pharmacopeia (USP)]. For example: For a SVP product with 10 bottles packed into one box as the unit of sale, this requires only one hologram to be affixed to the outer carton of the box and not on each bottle. This applies to all registered units of sale for that one product, where one hologram is required to be affixed to the outer carton of the box of 5's, 10's, 20's, 50's, or 100's. For a SVP product that does not have any outer carton, the hologram is then required to be affixed to the immediate label of the bottle or primary container as stated in the Drug Registration Guidance Document (DRGD).

SOP's for the labelling procedure, including documentation and reconciliation records should be maintained. | | 8. | | How detailed should the security label reconciliation record be? | | Reconciliation records should be as required under GMP requirements as for any other type of product label. | | 9. | | When will DCA begin inspection or enforcement on the use of the labels?
