Maidique Campus (MMC) in the Academic Health Center 3 Building, and on the Biscayne Bay Campus (BBC) in the Academic 2 Building. The College's baccalaureate and graduate degree programs are fully accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (initial accreditation occurred in 2008), the Council on Accredita tion (COA) of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs and are approved by the Florida Board of Nursing . A broad range of nursing degree programs are currently offered by the College and include a bachelor's degree in nursing, a master's degree in nursing - nurse educator, and a Doctor of Philosophy degree in nursing. The Doctor of Nursing Practice was impleme nted in January 2012. The nursing unit holds institutional memberships in the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN), the National League for Nursing (NLN), the Southern Collegiate Council of Nursing of the Southern Regional Education Board, the Florida Nurses Association (FNA), the Nursing Shortage Consortium of South Florida, and the South Florida Hospital and Health Care Association. History Nursing was present on the FIU campus from 1972 to 1978 when a RN -BSN degree was offered through the School of Health and Social Work. In 1982 the School of Nursing was established at BBC as an autonomous upper division unit through start -up funds provided by nine Miami hospitals. These health care organizations were concerned about the acute nursing shor tage and were interested in contributing to baccalaureate education for qualified men and women who could assume beginning leadership positions in health care in the rapidly growing South Florida region. The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) degree was approved as an upper division program in 1982 by the Board of Regents of the State University System. The National League for Nursing (NLN) granted initial accreditation in 1985. During 1997, the School of Nursing merged with the College of Health to create a new academic unit, the College of Health Sciences. The College of Health Sciences included the School of Nursing and the Departments of Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Dietetics and Nutrition, Medical Laboratory Sciences, Public Health, Health Information Management, and Speech -Language Pathology. The rationale for the merger was to enhance one of the University's strategic themes, Health , through the consolidation of the health professions programs and development of interdisciplinary education and research. During 1999, the College of Health Sciences merged with another academic unit, the College of Urban and Public Affairs, which gave rise to a new college, the Colle ge of Health and Urban Affairs (CHUA). CHUA included four schools: School of Nursing; School of Health; School of Social Work; and the School of Policy and Management. The purpose of the restructuring was to consolidate the health -related fields in one col lege and to enhance interdisciplinary education and research in these areas. Dr. Ronald Berkman was appointed Executive Dean of the College and Dr. Divina Grossman was appointed Dean of the School of Nursing. In December 2004, the School of Nursing joined its sister schools in CHUA by relocating from the BBC to a newly constructed Health and Life Sciences 2 building at the MMC, approximately 20 miles away . The move to the MMC was part of an overall strategy to locate nursing with other health related units in the context of the proposed medical school and the development of the academic health sciences complex. The new building provided nursing classrooms, teaching laboratories, offices, and research space. To provide for expansion, the school retained offi ces, classrooms, and laboratories at the BBC. 4 On October 1, 2006, the School of Nursing was transformed to the College of Nursing and Health Sciences (CNHS) when CHUA was disaggregated into three (3) autonomous units: the CNHS, the College of Social Work, Justice, and Public Affairs, and the Stempel School of Public Health. The CNHS included Nursing and the Departments of Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Health Information Management, Health Sciences, Communication Sciences and Disorder s, and Athletic Training. The disaggregation provided autonomy for the educational units as they sought accreditation or re - accreditation from their professional agencies and laid the foundation for the future health sciences complex. Dr. Divina Grossman was appointed Dean of the CNHS and reported to the Provost. In December 2006, University administrators announced that a new CNHS building would be erected on the MMC. The $47 million 113,000 sq. ft. building would house the College's combined disciplines that were scattered throughout two buildings and rapidly outgrowing them. Initial accredi tation by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) occurred in 2008 . The CNHS building (AHC 3), completed in December 2009, became part of the academic h ealth sciences complex envisioned at the MMC. In 2009, the University -wide budget cutting process required a feasibility review of all CNHS programs and tracks. Two College departments (Health Information Management and Health Sciences) were phased out as a result of the review. CNHS expansion re -occurred in 2011 with the assimilation of Health Services Administration, a baccalaureate level program previously housed in the Stempel College of Public Health and Social Work. In February 2010, CNHS Dean Divina Grossman was promoted to Vice - President of Engagement at FIU; Dr. Sharon Pontious was appointed Interim Dean until July 1, 2011, when Dr. Ora Strickland was appointed CNHS Dean. Thanks to a generous donation in the Fall of 2013, the college celebrated 3 0 years at FIU with a new name, The Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing and Health Sciences (NWCNHS). The current NWCNHS consists of the Nursing Unit as well as Departments of Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Communication Sciences and Disorders, Ath letic Training, and Health Services Administration. All academic departments are administered by Chairs. Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) Program Upon completion of the BSN Program, generic and accelerated option (AO) student graduate s are eligible to become licensed as registered nurse s. Graduates of the BSN Program are eligible for graduate level studies . BSN PROGRAM & CURRICULUM BSN Program Purposes The BSN program prepares graduates to practice in increasingly complex and technological health care systems. The purposes of the BSN program are to prepare the graduate to: Function as a professional nurse generalist. Function as an accountable and responsible citizen. 5 Participate in evidence -based health care del ivery, research, education, leadership, and consultation services in the local, regional, national, and global community. Recognize and respond to the need for continuing professional development. BSN Program Objectives The BSN program's purposes are achieved through program objectives. The objectives of the BSN program are to prepare the graduate to: Synthesize knowledge from nursing and related disciplines in the provision of care to clients within the health -illness continuum throughout the life span. Utilize creative leadership to promote quality health care and patient safety in a rapidly changing multicultural, multiethnic, global environment. Synthesize and apply evidence and research findings from nursing and from other disciplines to improve o r change nursing practice. Use appropriate and current technology and skills in the delivery of safe and effective patient care. Function as an advocate and change agent in influencing healthcare policies, delivery, economics, and health disparities to imp rove the quality of health for diverse populations. Collaborate and communicate with members of the health care team in the delivery of individualized, cost-effective, and ethical health care services. Demonstrate an understanding of accountability, responsibility, values, and standards of moral, ethical, and legal conduct that impact the role and practice of the professional nurse. Utilize theoretical knowledge and clinical competencies in caring for culturally diverse populations in a variety of clinical settings. 6 Nursing Unit Organizing Framework: BSN, MSN, and Doctoral (DNP & PhD) Programs 7 Curricu lum Framework Definitions COMMUNICATION & COLLABORATION. (Pervasive Thread). Communication is the process by which information, ideas, beliefs, values, and feelings are interchanged. Communication involves symbols, such as written words, gestures, images, and spoken language. Communication is influenced by inherent capacities, socio -cultural background, environment, attitudes, past experiences, knowledge of subject matter, and ability to relate to others. Communication is also affected by technological adv ances in health care. Communication is inherent in collaboration and requires critical thinking skills. Collaboration is the process of making and carrying out decisions with other people regarding health care and research in a caring context. Knowledge of health -care systems includes an understanding of the organization and environment in which nursing and health care is provided. Collaborative leadership is a set of skills to accomplish both individual and collective goals. Collaborative leaders must be e xcellent communicators of a clear vision based in theories of change and understanding of health care dynamics. Effective communication and collaboration are the foundation for developing therapeutic relationships for the purpose of providing patient care, conducting research, and collaborating with members of teams and communities at local, regional, national, and global levels. CULTURAL COMPETENCE. (Pervasive Thread). Cultural competence is the integration of knowledge, behaviors, skills, and attitudes required to provide quality health care and conduct research with people from different cultures, transcending national boundaries. Cultural competence involves tailoring health care delivery to meet patients' ecological, biosocial, cultural, and linguistic needs to improve outcomes and eliminate disparities in healthcare. Cultural competence includes being able to recognize and respond to patient population health -related beliefs and values, disease incidence and prevalence, genetics and treatment outcomes. Cultural competence may be viewed as a process by which the healthcare professionals continually engage in self -evaluation and strive to effectively work within the cultural context of the individual, family, population, and/or community. DECISION MAKING PROCESS. (Pervasive Thread). The decision -making process is the formulation and revision of conclusions based on knowledge acquired. The decision -making process requires reflective thought, interdisciplinary focus, global perspective, use of technology, ethical/le gal considerations, and comfort with ambiguity. Critical thinking entails the acquisition of knowledge with the intent of deliberate inquiry and involves understanding of different alternatives before making decisions. The decision -making process is influe nced by many factors such as: patterns and similarity recognition, sense of importance of the facts, common -sense understanding, skilled \"know -how\" and deliberate rationality. Decision making process outcomes incorporate scientific evidence, patient cultur e, values and preferences, and clinical expertise. ETHICS. (Pervasive Thread). Ethics is a set of shared values or principles that govern the way nurses interact with patients, families and other health professionals. A Code of Ethics makes explicit the p rimary goals, values, and obligations of a profession. Individuals who become nurses are expected not only to adhere to the ideals and moral norms of the profession, but also to embrace them as a part of what it means to be a nurse. The ethical tradition o f nursing is self -reflective, enduring, and distinctive. EVIDENCE -BASED PRACTICE, SCHOLARSHIP & RESEARCH. (Vertical Thread). Professional nursing is grounded in the application of evidence from research, expert panels, opinion leaders, research -based theories, clinical expertise, assessment data (including preferences and cultural values), and healthcare data. Basing practice on evidence from several sources improves outcomes in practice, education, administration, and research at local, regional, and nati onal, global levels. Professional nurses participate 8 in the scholarship of discovery, application, integration, and teaching. Professional nurses are committed to evaluating, creating, conducting, and communicating research findings. GENOMICS . (Pervasive Thread). Genetics refers to the study of individual genes and their impact on single gene conditions while genomics examines all genes together and how they interact with each other, the environment, cultural, psychosocial and other factors. T he study of genomics assists nurses and other health care practitioners and researchers to find better ways to promote health and prevent and treat disease in individuals, families, populations and communities. GLOBALIZATION. (Pervasive Thread). Globaliza tion is the system of interaction among the peoples, communities, and countries of the world. Globalization of health requires the dissemination of knowledge and the use of best evidence to impact policies and improve world health in a manner that transcen ds all cultural, economic, environmental, political, and social boundaries. The professional nurse utilizes an integrative, cross -disciplinary approach to effectively address health care disparities and reduce the overall burden of disease. GLOBAL HEALTH S YSTEMS. (Vertical Thread). Global health systems encompass the personnel, institutions, commodities, information, financing, and governance strategies that support universal delivery of health promotion and preventative services in a fair and equitable man ner, responding to people's needs and expectations. Global health systems define the administration of health care in terms of market incentives, health impact, consumer satisfaction, and performance monitoring. HEALTH/ ILLNESS MANAGEMENT. (Vertical Thread). Health/illness management includes a scope of services across the health/illness continuum. Nursing practice includes management of health promotion, risk reduction/illness/injury prevention, health maintenanc e, health restoration, rehabilitation, palliative and end of life care for diverse individuals, families, groups, and vulnerable populations. Optimal health/illness management requires nurses to apply and synthesize knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attitu des to make decisions, develop strategies, and design integrative plans of care. Health/illness management principles and guidelines are developed from nursing and interdisciplinary research. Health/illness management starts at the undergraduate level and builds at the graduate and doctoral level with increasing depth and breadth of knowledge, synthesis of data, complexity of skills and interventions, and role autonomy. PROFESSIONAL NURSING. (Vertical Thread). Professional nurses use a well -delineated and b road knowledge base for practice. Inherent in professional nursing is an understanding of the historical, legal, empirical, and contemporary context of research and evidence -based practice. Professional nursing requires strong critical reasoning, clinical judgment, communication, collaboration, and assessment skills. Professional nursing also requires the development and demonstration of a set of core values and principles, an ethical framework for practice, and involves accountability for oneself and nursi ng practice within the parameters of professional regulation, competencies and scope of practice. Professional nurses are advocates for high quality care and are knowledgeable and active in the policy processes defining healthcare delivery systems. The pro fessional nurse is committed to lifelong learning and continuous professional engagement, including graduate level of study. Professional nurses have advanced knowledge and clinical expertise necessary to promote health, provide care, educate, advocate, co nsult, and collaborate as well as facilitate change and provide organizational leadership. Professional nurses use and/or create knowledge through research. QUALITY & SAFETY. (Pervasive Thread). Quality represents the desired health outcomes that are cons istent with current professional knowledge. Quality care uses data to monitor the outcomes of care processes and uses improvement methods to design and test changes to continuously improve the 9 quality and safety of health care systems. Qualit y care is safe, effective, patient centered, timely, efficient, and equitable. Nursing focuses on the achievement of appropriate self -care, demonstration of health promoting behaviors, health -related quality of life, perception of being well cared for, and symptom management based on criteria as positive health outcomes. Patient safety is a critical component of high - quality health care. Safety minimizes risk of harm to patients and providers through both system effectiveness and individual performance. Nu rses integrate quality aspects into patient safety and are a pivotal component in the integration of nursing care and the care provided by other members of the health team and health system. TECHNOLOGY. (Pervasive Thread). Technology encompasses tools that are intended to enhance clinical practice and include, but are not limited to, computers, web-based applications, decision support systems, monitors, data gathering devices, and other technological supports for patient care interventions and knowledge dev elopment. Knowledge and skills in information and patient care technology are critical in preparing nursing graduates to deliver quality patient care in a variety of healthcare settings.

The College prepares diverse health care pro fessionals as providers and leaders in the delivery of high quality, accessible, culturally competent care within a highly technological and global environment; and promotes, expands and validates scientific knowledge and evidence -based practice through in terdisciplinary research. The goal of the Nursing Unit is to prepare qualified men and women for leadership roles in basic and advanced professional nursing practice in a rapidly changing, multicultural, multiethnic, global environment. FIU's Quality Enhan cement Plan, \"Global Learning for Global Citizenship,\" was the impetus for the BSN organizing curriculum framework which builds upon a common global concept schematically depicted as a \"globe.\" The \"globe\" symbolizes a cohesive global environment populated by levels, pervasive organizing threads, and vertical organizing threads that emanate from a solid base comprised of liberal education (general education, biological sciences, and behavioral sciences). Students progress through the levels of FOUNDATION OF NURSING KNOWLEDGE, NURSING SPECIALTY BASIC KNOWLEDGE, and SYNTHESIS OF NURSING KNOWLEDGE as they complete their plans of study. The levels encompass 1) seven pervasive organizing threads ( Genomics, Communication & Collaboration, Quality & Safety, Technology, Globalization, Decision Making Process, Ethics, and 10 Cultural Competence ); and four vertical organizing threads ( Global Health Systems, Health/Illness Management, Evidence -Based Practice, Scholarship & Research, and Professional Nursing ). Pervasive Organizing Threads The pervasive organizing threads of the framework include Genomics, Communication and Collaboration, Quality & Safety, Technology, Globalization, Decision Mak ing Process, Ethics, and Cultural Competence . These organizing threads are integrated throughout the curriculum and are found in course objectives at all levels of the programs of study. Vertical Organizing Threads The vertical organizing threads depicte d within the globe ( Global Health Systems, Health/Illness Management, Evidence Based Practice, Scholarship & Research and Professional Nursing ) are integrated and continuous throughout the levels of the BSN curriculum. These vertical threads are articulate d in logical progression from the base of the globe to the equator and represent successful transitions from simple to complex as well as provide depth and breadth to the curriculum. Global Health Systems Goals of the Nursing Unit and purposes and objectives of the BSN program are to prepare students to collaborate with local, national and international health care agencies in promoting excellence through cost-effective, accessible, equitable and humanistic health care delivery systems for divergent individuals, families and communities; utilize creative leadership to promote quality health care and patient safety in a rapidly changing multicultural, multiethnic, global environment; and function as an advocate and change agent in influencing healthca re policies, delivery, economics, and health disparities to improve the quality of health for diverse populations.

Curriculum Plan: Generic BSN Track The Generic BSN track is a four (4) year curriculum plan with a minimum 124 credits. A maximum of sixty (60) lower division credits (general education, biological sciences, behavioral sciences) can be transfer red toward the baccalaureate a degree in nursing. Over one half of the total required credits for the BSN program are in the upper division. Upper division courses are arranged in a prescribed sequence and courses at each level must be completed successful ly before the student can proceed to the next level of courses. Upon admission to the major, the track can be completed in five semesters. Allocation for credits is based on the University formula that one instructional credit unit equals one 50- minute clock (contact) hour. The ratio of credit to contact hour for classroom courses is 1:1, the ratio of credit to contact hour for laboratory courses is 1:2, and the ratio of credit to contact hour fo r clinical course s is 1:3. These ratios assure the level of l earning achievement necessary to provide for the competent role performance for the BSN graduate. Curriculum Plan: RN -BSN Track (Online) The RN to BSN track continues nursing education for registered nurses with coursework that is relevant to workplace experience, including health and wellness across cultures, nursing leadership in global healthcare, and community health. Students will become more accomplished nurses with a strong foundation in evidence -based nursing practices. The online RN to BSN curricu lum is flexible and adaptable to demanding schedules, with full or part -time options; however, students must complete the track within 3 years or 9 semesters (beginning Fall 2016). Students will earn a BSN with a minimum of 30 additional credits (3 full -time semesters) of upper division online coursework and an additional 30 credits earned through clinical and prior learning , bringing the total credits to 120 credits which includes the 60 lower division credits from a previously earned Associate of Science in Nursing (ASN) degree. Graduates of the RN to BSN program track are eligible to apply for graduate programs with advanced nursing degrees, such as a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN), or doctoral programs such as the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) or the BSN to PhD in Nursing program. Curriculum Plan: Accelerated Option BSN Track The Accelerated Option (A.O.) track is a full -time three (3) semester curriculum plan with a minimum of 61 upper division credits. All courses are arranged in a prescribed sequence and courses at ea ch level must be completed successfully before the student can proceed to the next level of courses. The population of students who apply to this track include students who earned their bachelor's degree in the United States, international Baccalaureate graduates, and foreign educated physicians who have earned their Doctor of Medicine outside the U.S. ***Information about all three tracks listed above can be found at the following website: https://cnhs.fiu.edu/ 14 GENERAL STUDENT INFORMATION/POLICIES & PROCEDURES Current Address, Phone Number and E -Mail Address Florida International University (FIU) and the Nicole Wertheim College of Nursing and Health Sciences (NWCNHS) require that students keep current addresses and telephone numbers on file . E-mail addresses are also valuable for communications. A current address and phone number allows College personnel to contact students for emergencies, class changes, awards, academic questions/information, etc. The Office of the Registrar must be notified immediately of any change in address and/or phone number. The College and University must also be notified if a student changes his/her name. Professional Conduct and Responsibilities In addition to meeting the academic standards of the University and College, students enrolled in nursing courses must demonstrate professionalism in classroom, laboratory, and clinical experiences. Professionalism is defined as behaviors and attitudes congruent with the ANA Code of Ethics, guidelines and standards of practice, the Florida Nurse Practice Act, and policies and expectations of the College and University. Inherent within the concept of professionalism is the development of those behaviors by the student during the program that demonstrate increasing maturity, competence, integrity, regard for human dignity, respect for social justice, accountability, responsibility, and caring as they progress through the program. Students are expected to respect the rights of others regardless of their race, religion, nationality, gender, age, sexual orientation, physical condition or mental state. Professionalism includes, but is not limited to, satisfactory academic and clinical conduct and performance. Administrators and faculty of the undergraduate program reserve the right to interpret, maintain, and enforce the standards of professional conduct and performance for nursing. Administrators and faculty also reserve the right to recommend dismissal of any student who has violated the standards of professional conduct or demonstrates a lack of professional development.

These courses include English Composition/Writi ng, Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Humanities, Arts, and Foreign Language. Students must meet the \"Gordon Rule\" English Writing and Mathematics requirements mandated by the Florida legislature. The Offices of Admissions and/or Undergraduat e Studies determine that a student has satisfactorily met these requirements. Students are encouraged to print out the PDA each semester to determine their course completion status and contact their faculty advisor or the Program Director if questions. Transfer Credits An undergraduate applicant will receive credit for previous academic work appropriate to the BSN in accordance with the articulation agreements with community colleges and undergraduate nursing program requirements. All applicants must have their transcripts evaluated by University and NWCNHS personnel to determine transferable credits. 1. Applicants who have received an Associate in Arts (AA) degree from an accredited Florida community college may transfer up to 60 credits toward the baccalau reate degree. 2. Students who enter FIU without an AA degree, transfer from out -of-state, or transfer from a private community college must meet the FIU core curriculum requirements and must satisfy State of Florida mandated Gordon rule requirements. 3. Applicants who have completed academic credit at the upper division level of an accredited four - year college or university may transfer up to 30 additional upper division credits above the 60 lower division credits transferred; credits in the major must b e approved by the admitting track. 4. Applicants who have taken BSN courses at another institution and are requesting a transfer into a NWCNHS BSN track must 1) meet the current NWCNHS admission standards in place for the BSN track; and 2) must provide evidence that he/she was a student in \"good standing\" at the time of withdrawal from the previous institution. 5. All prerequisite and co -requisite courses for the undergraduate program require at least a grade of \"C\" for transfer. 6. International stude nt applicants must meet the University's admission requirements as noted in the FIU Undergraduate Catalog. These students should contact the Office of International and Scholar Services for assistance with transcript analysis, etc. 7. In order to receive a de gree from FIU, students must take a minimum of 30 upper division credits at FIU. 17 8. The last 30 credits at FIU should not be interrupted by course work at another institution. Students who are requesting to take a course at another institution, such as a community college, must meet with their advisor to discuss their request. Students who take courses at another institution must fill out a Transient Student Form in order to register for the course. Dropping and Adding Courses To drop and/or add a course, the student must follow the instructions found in the FIU Registration website. See the Academic Calendar for drop/add deadlines. Because of the differing progression plans of the tracks, students cannot transfer between tracks unless approved by the Chair. St udents must notify their advisors and the course professor prior to dropping any course. Students who fail to notify their advisors may jeopardize their progression in the undergraduate nursing program. Withdrawal from the University If a student withdraws from the University for personal reasons, a Withdrawal form must be obtained and submitted to the Office of the Registrar. No signatures are required from the NWCNHS. However, it is a courtesy to notify the College of the student's intention to withdraw. If a student must withdraw from the University after the final withdrawal date because of major illness, the student can complete the appropriate forms to petition for an excused withdrawal. The student must provide documentation of the illness and attach it to the withdrawal form. The Withdrawal Form can be obtained from the Office of the Registrar. Re-Entry to Nursing Program If a BSN student drops out, withdraws, fails course(s), or otherwise interrupts the sequence of the nursing program in any way tha t falls outside their original plan of study, he/she must petition the Chair of Undergraduate Nursing either for re -entry into the nursing program and/or for an out -of-sequence plan of study. In the event re -entry is granted, he/she must update all clinica l requirements related to health, immunizations, and background screening prior to re -entry. All clinical requirements including CPR and health insurance must be current at the time of re -entry, and the students must be cleared by Complio. Returning studen ts must comply with all current requirements and must contact the Director of Clinical Education and the Chair of Undergraduate Nursing eight weeks prior to the semester of return to determine if clinical placements are possible. Clinical placement will be made on a space available basis. All requirements must be maintained throughout the nursing program. If a student does not return and enroll in classes after two consecutive semesters, the student will be dismissed from the BSN Program. RN-BSN applicants must have : an unencumbered Florida registered nurse license; an ASN degree from an ACEN (Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing) accredited educational institution with the ASN GPA of 2.75 or higher; minimum of 60 transferable lower division credits; Gordon Rule requirem ents, University Core Curriculum requirement, and foreign language requirement. RN-BSN applicants who have taken BSN courses at another institution and are requesting a transfer into the NWCNHS RN -BSN track must have all coursework evaluated by FIU Nursing Faculty to determine course equivalency and are allowed a maximum of 6 transfer upper division Nursin g credits. 30 credits of upper division coursework must be completed at FIU. Approved, transferred nursing coursework must be completed within 5 years of enrollment, including Excelsior exams. 18 Students who experience a medical problem or pregnancy while in the nursing program must provide a statement from their health care provider indicating the student's ability to return to full duty without restrictions prior to attending clinical. Students may be required to repeat or take additional courses, or prescribed remediation to complete degree requirements. Please refer to our website http://cnhs.fiu.edu for the most current information on applicatio n deadlines. Program Major Change A student who has decided to change his/her major must obtain and submit the form to the Office of the Registrar. If the student is transferr ing to the NWCNHS, the student must fill out the form and obtain signatures from the College. Students who change majors will be evaluated in accordance with the undergraduate nursing program's admission criteria and deadlines. Letters of Recommendation A student or graduate may request a letter of recommendation from a faculty member. Faculty members have the right to grant or deny the request. The student or graduate must request the letter of recommendation in writing supplying the address and name of in dividual or departmental agency to whom the letter should be addressed. Recommendations must be requested at least two weeks in advance. Upon request, please forward your CV/resume and unofficial transcript to the faculty member. ACADEMIC PROGRESSION INFO RMATION/POLICIES & PROCEDURES Program Length Generic BSN students progress full -time through the nursing curriculum and complete the track in five semesters. Accelerated Option BSN students enroll full -time and complete the track in three semesters plus a winter intersession Students who have not registered for three consecutive semesters must re - apply for admission to the University and the College, completing the appropriate forms available from the Office of Admissions. RN-BSN Readmission Requirements Admitted RN -BSN students who have not enrolled in any FIU course for three consecutive terms will be required to apply for re -admission to FIU and to the NWCNHS. RN -BSN re -admission applicants previously dismissed by NWCNHS can reapply after 5 years since their last term of enrollment. The applicant must meet the current RN -BSN track admission requirements, including the program of study, in effect at the time of re -admission, including program GPA requirements. When seeking readmission, a returning RN -BSN student must meet with a NWCNHS Program Coordinator to determine how their previous coursework will fit within the current RN - BSN curriculum requirements in effect at the time of readmission. Readmission applicants with RN-BSN core coursework completed six (6 ) or more years previously with below a \"B\" course grade and an FIU RN -BSN GPA below at 3.0 may not use the core courses towards degree completion and will need to repeat those courses . Students may be required to repeat or take additional courses to complete degree requirements. The RN -BSN st udent may choose to enroll as a full -time or part -time student; however, the nursing course sequence must be completed within 3 years (beginning Fall 2016) or 9 semesters and may even be completed by the student in one calendar year (by completing 3 -4 cour ses/semester). If a student is unable to complete the program courses and requirements within three years, the student must petition the Chair of Undergraduate Nursing for an extension of one semester. 19 Course Sequencing The BSN course sequen cing moves from foundational courses to complex courses and from a focus on the individual to a focus on the community. Each clinical nursing course builds on the knowledge of the previous courses. Courses in each level of the curriculum must be completed before advancing to the next. Any variations must be approved by the Chair of Undergraduate Nursing. Due to University/College insurance requirements, students must be registered for a nursing course in order to practice as a student in the clinical area. Any separation from the nursing program in any of the pre -licensure tracks (Generic, AO) needs to be approved by the Chair of Undergraduate Nursing with a remediati on plan. Any student who separates from the program without prior written approval of the Chair of Undergraduate Nursing must reapply to the program. If the student is granted re -entry and/or readmitted, a remediation plan will be created and executed for successful graduation and NCLEX readiness. If a student does not return and enroll in classes after two consecutive semesters, the student will be dismissed from the BSN Program. Double Majors, Two Bachelor's Degrees and/or Minors Students in the College must fully disclose their dual status to their advisor upon admission and/or upon request to add major/degree/minor. Academic & Clinical Grievances/Complaints Students must follow the NWCNHS grievance policies/procedures when filing a complaint or grievance (example: a grade or progression decision) related to the academic and/or clinical settings. This policy is posted on the NWCNHS website and is also contained within this document. Contact a faculty member or staff member for clarification of any policies or procedures. RN-BSN Clinical Placement Requirements Nursing Core Courses, Upper Division Electives, Prior Learning Assessments and/or Equivalency Exams, & University Core Curriculum must be successfully completed as well as background check, drug test, immunizations, RN Student Liability Insurance prior to final semester deadlines: December 1st - Deadline for spring final semester enrollment April 1st - Deadline for summer final semester enrollment August 1st - Deadline for fall final semester enrollment Students will also need to complete the Practicum Request Form in order to be e ligible to begin the NUR4945L course the following semester. Students will also need to complete the RN to BSN Clinical Preliminary Form in order to be eligible to begin the NUR 4636C course the following semester. 20 GRADES AND GRADING Communicating Grades Grades are obtained through the http://my.fiu.edu web site. Students will need their Panther ID and password to obtain grades. Otherwise, grades are communicated through a procedure designated by the faculty member. Only faculty members are authorized to report grades over the phone. Grade Point Average To achieve and maintain a classification of \"good standing,\" a student must maintain a grade point average (GPA) of 2.0. Unofficial student transcripts can be obtained on the http://my.fiu.edu website. In order to graduate, nursing students may only earn 2 \"C\" grades in core coursework. Upon the second \"C,\" students will be placed on Probation, resulting in an Academic Hold placed on the student's account. Student mus t meet with Academic Advisor/Program Coordinator and Chair. Repeating Nursing Courses and Dismissal A grade of \"C\" or better in all nursing courses, NUR courses, is necessary for continuing in the undergraduate program. If a student earns two \"C\" grades in two Nursing courses, the student will be placed on Probation, resulting in an Academic Hold placed on the student's account. In order to remove the hold and to continue in the program, the student must meet with the Chair of Undergraduate Nursing and wi th the Academic Advisor/Program Coordinator. Also, students are only allowed to fail one nursing course in the curriculum, and nursing courses can be repeated only once. A failed nursing course that is repeated and passed with a \"C\" will result in the stud ent acquiring 1 failed nursing course (only 1 failure allowed 1 time). If a student fails the same course twice or any two courses, he/she will be dismissed from the program . After successfully completing the repeated course, the student must obtain and submit a Repeated Course (grade forgiveness) form to the Office of the Registrar per University policies. While both grades will be included on the student's transcript, only the last grade for the repeated course will be computed into the student's GPA. Even if grade forgiveness is used on a failed nursing course, the one failed nursing course still is counted towards t he \"one failure only\" rule, and a subsequent failure would lead to dismissal. NOTE: Students who drop one or more courses in one semester for academic reasons may re-enter the undergraduate program one time only. Any subsequent drop or failure will result in dismissal from the nursing program. This rule applies to AO and Generic tracks. For all pre -licensure program students, a failure in Senior Nursing Synthesis (NUR 4940) is not considered a second failure if the first failure was a different NUR course. However, students are only allowed two attempts to successfully complete this course (NUR 4940). After one failure of NUR 4940, the nursing student will be required to take a prescribed, official NCLEX review class (at their own cost) and to provide docu mentation of the same prior to enrolling in the second attempt of NUR 4940. Two failures in NUR 4940 will result in dismissal from the track. The student will be dismissed upon the second unsuccessful attempt. Remediation for any/all nursing courses is at the discretion of the Chair of Undergraduate Nursing. In the RN -BSN track, upper division, non -nursing electives and nursing electives must be passed with a grade of \"C\" or higher. The one failure only policy listed above does not apply to the electives taken in RN -BSN. The one failure policy applies to core classes, including clinical classes, and any classes that may apply tow ard challenge exam credit in the RN -BSN track. 21 If a student completes an accelerated eight -week session NUR course with a failing grade and the course is dropped after the official university add/drop period resulting in a grade of \"DR \", the course is considered a failure. Grading Scale A 93-100% 00-66% SEE BELOW Course Grades A 77% or higher average of all testing in any clinical and/or didactic course is required to pass a course. In the event a student has not achieved a 77% average for all testing in a course, a pass will not be achieved. Grades are not \"rounded up\" ( i.e., 76.7% is a 76%, not a 77%). F zero Grade An F0 (F zero) will be given to students who both earn a failing grade based on course standards and who fail to complete at least 60% of the course requirements or fail to attend at least 60% of class sessions. An F0 equals zero grade points per credit hour and is a permanent grade. Incomplete \"I\" Grade An incomplete grade is a temporary symbol given at the discretion of the instructor for work not completed because of serious interruption not caused by the student's own negligence. An incomplete must be made up as quickly as p ossible, but no later than two consecutive semesters after the course ending or it will automatically default to an \"F\" or the grade that the student earned in the course. There is no extension of the two-semester deadline. The student must not register ag ain for the course to make up the incomplete. Students who have incomplete grades on their records must remove the incomplete by the end of the fourth week of the term in which they plan to graduate. Failure to do so will result in a cancellation of gradua tion. \"Incompletes\" in BSN clinical courses (theory and laboratory) must be completed to a grade before progression. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that the faculty member has received the missing materials in a timely fashion and completes the necessary grade change in the system. The student should print out his/her unofficial transcript three to four weeks after the form was initiated to ensure that the change was entered on the student's transcript. If it has not been entered, t he faculty member must be notified immediately. If the faculty member is not available, the Chair of Undergraduate Nursing must be notified. 22 NWCNHS Student Academic Grievance/Appeal Procedure NWCNHS students have the right to grieve/appeal ac ademic grading/course complaints/ controversies and program progression/dismissal decisions. According to the FIU Student Policy (undergraduate and graduate) written guidelines: The FIU Academic Grievance Procedure indicates the reasons (nature of appeal) for an academic grievance include: \"covers academic grievances which are defined as any complaint or controversy alleging: 1) unprofessional conduct by a professor which adversely affects either a student's ability to satisfy academic expectations, whethe r in the classroom, the field, or a lab, or the student's actual performance; 2) improper admission counseling; 3) improper counseling by an adviser; 4) arbitrary grading for coursework, comprehensive examination, thesis or dissertation; and 5) arbitrary n on-renewal of a graduate assistant or arbitrary dismissal from a course or program.\" Students who wish to appeal MUST FIRST follow the NWCNHS academic grievance/appeal procedure. 1.

If a student has not received a certified letter within ten (10) business days of the submitted appeal, the student MUST contact the office of the administrator. 8. The Dean's decision is final. ACADEMIC CONDUCT AND PERFORMANCE Students are expected to watch the Dean's video on student misconduct located at https://cnhs.fiu.edu/resources/students/policies -forms/index.html and review the FIU Stude nt Handbook http://studentaffairs.fiu.edu/about/student -handbook/ for details on Standards of Student Conduct and Policies. The FIU Standards of Student Conduct address three major areas of moral integrity: Academic Honesty, Respect for the Law, and Respect for People . Students who plagiarize, cheat and/or harass an instructor or peer may be charged with academic misconduct. Penalties for academic misconduct may include dismissal from the University. Below are the definitions of plagiarism, cheating, and harassment: Plagiarism Plagiarism is the deliberate use and appropr iation of another's work without any indication of the source and the passing off of such work as the student's own. Students who are using another person's ideas or writings must document their sources. Direct quotes must be consistent with American Psych ological Association (APA) format. Any student who fails to give credit for ideas or materials taken from another is guilty of plagiarism. Any student helping another plagiarize may be found guilty of academic misconduct. Cheating Cheating is the unauthori zed use of books, notes, aids or assistance from another person with respect to examinations, course assignments, field service reports, class recitations, or possession of examination papers or courses materials, whether originally authorized or not. Any student helping another cheat may be found guilty of academic misconduct. Harassment Harassment is defined as conduct that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment for another person of group. This definition includes harassment and threa ts through computers or electronic communication. 24 Course Requirements Students are expected to adhere to the stated course requirements outlined in the course syllabus by faculty (provided at the beginning of the course), including due dates for assignments and the specified grading system. Unless prior arrangements have been made with the faculty member, work that is submitted late is downgraded one FULL letter grade for each day the paper/project is late until the grade of \"F\" is reach ed. Students are expected to be prepared for all classes and to participate in them. Students should not ask a faculty member to change the course requirements by requesting special treatment such as \"extra credit\" work to raise a grade or ask for extensi ons of deadlines for papers. These requests are unfair to other students and the faculty member. Classroom Conduct and Responsibilities As a matter of common courtesy, students should not enter classrooms late; carry on conversations, even whispered ones; or take up class time with questions of solely personal interest. Taping class lectures is at the discretion of each faculty member. The student must request permission before taping any classroom activity. Mobile phones must be placed on vibrate or turned off during class periods. Children or pets are never permitted in the classrooms unless for specified laboratory experiences. Food and drinks are not permitted in the classrooms or the laboratories. This is a University policy. Students are expected to assist in keeping the School, College, and University laboratories, classrooms, and lounge areas in a presentable condition at all times. In consideration of others, classroom furniture or equipment that is moved during a teaching/learning activity should be returned to its original location. Attendance Students are expected to attend all classes, clinicals, and laboratory experiences. Courses include the instructional strategy of shared knowledge and experience between students during group presentations and discussions. Absence interferes with the student's ability to learn from this in class sharing. Students with military service obligations ( i.e., weekend duty, drilling, training, etc.) must inform professors as soon as students are notified of orders a nd military obligations. It is the student's responsibility to coordinate with each professor to make up required assignments and clinical rotations. In the case of a military order, students must provide orders or a copy of official documentation (please black out or white out any social security numbers) of orders to faculty. Students are expected to read and adhere to the course syllabus regarding clinical and class attendance. Excessive absence or habitual tardiness for any reason may affect the course grade (since the stated course objectives cannot be met) and can result in failure. Written Assignments All written work is to be submitted on the announced due date unless the student made previous arrangements with the faculty member. Computers are available for student use in the computer laboratories. Formal written papers (term or scholarly papers) shal l follow the format using the guidelines of the American Psychological Association's (APA) Publication Manual (the latest edition is available for purchase at the FIU Bookstore). 25 EXAMINATION POLICIES/PROCEDURES Students encounter a variety o f test forms including multiple -choice, short answer, essay, tandem testing, and take-home tests. Instructions for examinations will be provided by the course faculty member. Examination Security Students must have their Panther One ID card picture ID on t heir person at the time of the examination for identification purposes. If exams are closed -book, students may not use notes, texts, dictionaries, or other materials (including smart phones); nor can they talk to other students during the exam. If a studen t has a problem or question, it must be discussed with no one other than the faculty member proctoring the exam. If a student leaves the classroom, he/she will be asked to hand in the paper and will not be permitted to return. Students should use the bath room facilities before an exam. Faculty members proctoring the exam have complete discretion on whether students are allowed bathroom trips and, if so, the procedures for bathroom trips. Examination Reviews Reviews of exams are at the discretion of the cou rse faculty. No other person, including another faculty member, Chair, Associate Dean, or Dean can review and/or discuss the exam with the student (unless permission is granted by the course faculty member). Failure to Take Examination Students unable to t ake the exam at the scheduled time must make arrangements with the faculty member PRIOR to the exam date. If the student communicates with the faculty member prior to the exam, possible alternate arrangements can be discussed. If a student fails to communicate with the faculty member prior to the exam and subsequently claims an emergency, illness, or accident, the explanation will be considered to determine extenuating circumstances. If extenuating circumstances are found, the s tudent will not be penalized. If the faculty member believes there to be no extenuating circumstances, the student MAY be allowed to take the exam and may receive a lower grade at the discretion of the faculty member. An alternate exam may be selected by the faculty member if taken late by the student. Medication Calculation Test All pre -licensure BSN students must pass a medication calculation test with a score of 90% or better each semester. Basic (non -programmable) calculators may be used for courses a t Level 2 and above. Students can take a medication calculation test two times only. Students who do not pass the medication test will not be allowed to progress in the course and clinical areas, and the days missed will be counted as clinical absences. Students who fail a medication calculation test two times must drop the clinical course . Final Examinations In courses in which a cumulative (or comprehensive) final exam is given, the student must pass the final exam by a grade of 77% to pass the course. Students are not allowed to re -take exams if they fail . 26 Computer -Based Clinical Examinations Students are required to take computer -based clinical examinations at the completion of their clinical courses. The purpose of the computer -based exam inations is to provide students with feedback related to their current clinical knowledge (strengths and weaknesses) of the specialty area. Students are encouraged to use the feedback to review for the RN licensing examination. Exit Examination All pre -licensure BSN tracks require students to pass a nursing synthesis (Exit) examination during the last semester as a prerequisite to the BSN degree. The exam will be given as part of the requirement for the Senior Synthesis Course NUR 494 0. If the student fails the first attempt of the synthesis examination, he/she will have an opportunity retake the exam. If the student fails the second attempt, he/she will receive a failing grade for the course and will have to re -register for the Senior Synthesis Course NUR 4940. After one failure of NUR 4940, the nursing student will be required to take a prescribed, official NCLEX review class (at their own cost) and to provide documentation of the same prior to enrolling in the second attempt of NUR 4 940. Passing the Exit Examination at the specified level is a requirement for graduation and is non -negotiable. If a student does not return and enroll in classes after two consecutive semesters, the student will be dismissed from the BSN Program. If a student takes the exit exa m successfully but then does not graduate on time due to a failure or separation from the program or other extenuating circumstances, another successful/passing exit exam will be required for graduation and release of student name to the Board of Nursing. If a student does not have a successful exit exam in the semester they are graduating, their name will not be released to the Board of Nursing. UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC WARNING, PROBATION, AND DISMISSAL Academic Warning Undergraduate students in academic jeopardy are notified through conferences or in writing by the course faculty member, advisor, and/or the Chair. An undergraduate student whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.0 will be placed on Academic Warning by the University. To remove the Academic Warning status, a student must attain a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or above in the subsequent semester. See the FIU Undergraduate Catalog for further information. Prior Learning Assessment Florida Licensed Registered Nurses with an associate degree in nursing (ADN/ASN) from an ACEN accredited institution, who meet admission criteria are eligible to receive up to 27 credits awarded through FIU nursing faculty -led Prior Learning Assessment (PLA). The PLA process takes place within the context of a 3 -credit course designed to support RN -to-BSN students' transition and socialization to the role of baccalaureate prepared professional nurses. 27 Academic Probation A student on Academic Warning whose cumulative GPA remai ns below 2.0 will be placed on Academic Probation by the University. To remove the Academic Probation status, a student must attain a GPA of 2.5 for the subsequent semester. See the FIU Undergraduate Catalog for further information. Dismissal A course in the BSN curriculum can be repeated only once. If an undergraduate student fails the same course twice or any two courses, he/she will be automatically dismissed from the nursing program. An undergraduate student on probation whose cumulative and semester GPAs fall below a 2.0 will automatically be dismissed from the program and the University. Students are advised to refer to the FIU Undergraduate Catalog for further information. NOTE: The preceding are university -wide policies and procedures; however, all nur sing students should refer to the BSN Student Handbook grades and grading section for further information. CLINICAL CONDUCT AND PERFORMANCE Clinical Evaluation Clinical performance is evaluated during each clinical nursing course by course faculty and preceptors. Clinical evaluation tools are designed to address specific course expectations and objectives. Typical clinical expectations include, but are not limited to: Safe, effective, ethical performance of nursing tasks; Problem solving; Use of approp riate judgment; Appropriate communication and interaction with others; Ability to apply knowledge. Professional Behavior and Language in the Clinical Setting Nursing students are expected to respect the rights of others regardless of their race, religion, nationality, gender, age, sexual orientation, physical condition or mental state, in both laboratory and clinical settings. Refer to Appendix 1: Standards of Professional Behavior for further detail. Refer to https://regulations.fiu.edu/regulation for current FIU regulations regarding: Sexual Harassment (Title IX) and Sexual Misconduct, Nondis crimination, Harassment and Retaliation (Title VII). Students are expected to: Adhere to established laboratory and clinical deadlines. Have no laboratory and clinical absences, either at arrival or while in the clinical setting. Exhibit promptness when attending classroom, laboratory, and clinical experiences. Remain for the entire laboratory clinical learning experience, unless excused. Adhere to policies and procedures related to the assigned clinical agency. Promptly and properly identify oneself and role during clinical experiences. Adhere to the uniform and dress policies found in the BSN student policies/procedures manual . 28 Unprofessional Conduct and/or Professional Misconduct Nursing students are expected to act in a manner consistent with the ANA Code of Ethics. Failure to comply may result in action by nursing administrators and/or faculty including, in appropriate cases, dismissal from the nursing program. Examples include, but are not limit ed to: Negligence in patient care. Unprofessional behavior either at the laboratory or at the clinical agency. Substantiated act or acts of patient abuse, either physical or verbal. Unsatisfactory performance as judged by the clinical supervisor. Neglect of duty with actual cause or potential to cause patient harm. Fraudulent or egregious acts. Demonstrated and/or documented incompetence. Personal conduct which adversely effects the work environment and/or the supervisor's ability to perform his/her responsibilities. Exhibiting aggressive or intimidating behavior (e.g., profanities, threats, loud talking, rudeness, verbal coercion) toward or in the presence of faculty, staff, peers, patients/clients, or agency personnel. Attempting to use paid time from employer as clinical hours. Clinical Probation, Failure, and Dismissal A student who demonstrates unprofessional conduct and/or professional misconduct will be notified by the faculty member of such behavior. The faculty member will counsel the student, document the occurrence of the behaviors in writing and place the documentation in the student's file. The student may respond in writing within 48 hrs. to the faculty member's findings and/or submit written documentation relevant to the behavior. Depending on the nature of the behavior, the faculty member, in consultation with the Program Chair, may place the student on clinical probation. Clinical Probation Clinical probation is based on the performance of the student in relationship to course objectives and expected behaviors and attitudes that are consistent with those of a professional nurse. In addition, to persistent behavior or behaviors related to unprofessional conduct (see above), the student enrolled in a clinical nursing course may be p laced on clinical probation for one or more of the following: Initiating clinical experiences without a contract; Initiating interventions or actions without appropriate supervision or approval of the supervisor; Consistent difficulties in applying theory to the clinical setting; Violating patient confidentiality/HIPAA; Inconsistently completing clinical assignments or logs. The faculty member will notify the Chair of Undergraduate Nursing of any student who is placed on clinical probation. In addition, the faculty member will send a letter to the student indicating the areas of weakness as the basis for clinical probation. A copy of the letter will be placed in the student's academic file. 29 The student is expected to complete the r equirements of the probation by the end of the course. If the student demonstrates satisfactory progress in improving performance and meets the course objectives, the faculty will remove the probationary status at the end of the course. Failure to meet the requirements of the probation will result in clinical failure. Clinical Failure Clinical failure is based on the unsatisfactory performance of the student in relationship to the course objectives, expected behaviors, and attitudes that are consistent with those of a professional nurse. A student enrolled in a clinical nursing course may receive a clinical failure and/or dismissal from the nursing program for one or more of the following: Failure to demonstrate satisfactory progress after being placed on c linical probation; Recurring absenteeism or tardiness in the clinical setting that has not been approved by the professor in advance of planned clinical experience; Recurring failure to follow clinical course policies, policies of the clinical agency, or recommendations of the supervisor; Acts of dishonesty; Repeated lack of preparation for the clinical setting; Demonstrating behaviors that, in the judgment of the faculty, constitute unsafe or potentially unsafe practice; Demonstrating practices that are inconsistent with professional standards or codes of ethics; Unsatisfactory final clinical evaluation; Attempting to use paid time from employer as clinical hours; Failure of student to keep clinical clearance items up -to-date, resulting in multiple clinic al absences. The faculty member will notify the Chair of Undergraduate Nursing of any student who earns a clinical failure. In addition, the faculty will place a copy of the letter sent to the student indicating the clinical failure in the student's acade mic file. Dismissal A student may be dismissed without a probationary period for identified infractions. Grounds for dismissal without a probationary period include: Level of incompetence representing a threat to patient safety; Falsification of documents or records; While in the clinical area, being under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or any controlled substances not legally prescribed; Insubordination or failure to follow direct orders from a clinical supervisor; Theft of College, University, or agency property; The inappropriate administration of any drug or treatment without the permission of the clinical supervisor. 30 CLINICAL EXPERIENCES Clinical Agencies Various agencies throughout the community are utilized as clinical learning experience sites for nursing students. The student has a responsibility to follow the regulations of each agency (including but not limited to orientation materials, immunization v erification, health screenings, and maintaining CPR certification) and to exhibit professional conduct at all times. All students must submit information to Complio for background/drug screening and current clearance items as a requirement for clinical placement at health care facilities. Screening and clearance items must be kept up -to-date by the student at all times, or students' grades will be affected and may require students to drop courses. It is possible that participation at a particular facility m ay necessitate additional screening or that, at any time, additional screening may be required during the program (may incur an additional cost). Failure to complete needed screening within the prescribed time may result in failure of the course or dismiss al from the program. Clinical Groups Students are placed in clinical groups at faculty discretion. The student who wishes to change his/her clinical group must find a student from the preferred group who is willing to change groups and make a request in wr iting to the Director of Clinical Education within two business days of the email notifying of the clinical assignment. The student must clearly state the rationale for the change. The Director of Clinical Education may grant a request if group information has not been forwarded to the facilities for placement and no other conflict exists. All orientation materials for clinical placement must be completed within one week of student notification. Failure to complete orientation materials within the deadline may result in an administrative drop from the course. Transportation All students are expected to have transportation to and from their clinical sites. Faculty members are not responsible for arranging students' assignments according to carpools , distance from home or work to clinical site, work schedules, or making babysit ting/day -care arrangements. Clinical Assignments and Preparation The student is directly responsible to the supervising faculty member. The student taking a clinical course also functions as a member of the health care team. Faculty will provide clinical a ssignments based upon the course objectives and learning level of the student. Assignments are made prior to the clinical experience and, unless the student is told otherwise, the student will pick up his/her own assignment at the appropriate agency that d ay or evening. The student will prepare for the clinical experience by reviewing the client's chart, nursing procedures, textbooks, and class notes. Clinical Clearance Deadline Clinical clearance MUST be completed 2 weeks prior to the start of the semester and reflect that all clinical clearance items will be valid through the entire semester. This is a non -negotiable requirement. Students will be dismissed from the nursing program if the deadline is not met, and it is the first semester in the program. Stu dents will be dropped from all clinical courses if the deadline is not met, and it is semester 2 or beyond in the program. The foregoing does not apply to RN -BSN students. RN-BSN students have clinical experiences with a preceptor in Senior Clinical Pra cticum (NUR 4945L). Students may not obtain clinical hours in the same location as their exact work location or unit. Preceptors may be utilized within the same agency but in a different location than where the student works. No paid time may be used for c linical hours. Preceptors for these clinical courses must be nurses 31 with a baccalaureate degree in nursing. In addition, all clinical sites must have a current contract with the NWCNHS. Preceptor approval will be made by the faculty member and not demonstrate any conflict of interest. The RN -BSN Senior Clinical Practicum allows transition from student to graduate role through leadership experiences in selected settings. It is best to seek a preceptor within your facility. Preceptors who are advanced practice nurses i.e., clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners, who solely are in the role of primary care providers, are not an appropriate preceptor for this course and will not be approved. Such nursing roles are not appropriate for this course because you cannot transition into that role with a BSN degree and because the experience with that preceptor will not meet the objectives of this course. Practicum hours to gain clinical nursing skills in a specialized hospital unit floor, ER or ICU will not meet objectives for this course and practicum requests for these types of experiences will not be approved. The following practicum experiences are appropriate for this course: Quality Assurance Risk Management Infection Control Telehealth and or Informatics Healthcare Facility Educator Simulation Faculty Distance Learning Faculty Research Faculty Research leader Healthcare facility Research Clinical Coordinator Nurse Managers: Associate and Head Nurses Nurse Coordinator Case Mana gement and or Liaisons Other similar leadership experiences Time scheduling for precepted courses is arranged between the student and the preceptor with the faculty member's approval. The student always has a responsibility to follow the regulations of ea ch agency/site and to exhibit professional conduct. Students are expected to complete the required practicum hours for Care of Communities: Community Health (NUR 4636C) and Senior Clinical Practicum (NUR 4945L) by the completion of the semester in which t hey are registered. Students are also expected to maintain a log documenting their activities. The clinical faculty member will communicate with each student and the preceptor during the clinical experience to determine that the student is able to meet cou rse objectives. Both courses have online discussions with all students for the purpose of sharing experiences. The student is expected to arrange their schedule in order to attend these discussions. Practicum requirements are NOT waived if you move out of the South Florida area or if you cannot locate a practicum setting/preceptor. Faculty members and advisors are not responsible for locating practicum experiences for students. 32 Chart Documentation All student charting entries must be co -signed by the supervising faculty instructor, the responsible RN, or the RN preceptor. Keys Students are occasionally offered or request unit keys. If the student accepts or utilizes keys, the student is completely responsible for returning the keys to the appropriate person before leaving the unit. If the student takes unit keys off the unit or out of the hospital, the student will be required to return the keys immediately (including driving back to the facility). Photography Students are forbidden to take photographs while in clinical settings. This policy includes all cameras and cellular pho nes. Student Social Media Use Policy Please refer to Appendix 2: Student Social Media Use Policy for detailed information regarding the use of social media and web -based network platforms. Family Members and/or Friends as Patients Students may not pract ice on any unit where a family member or close friend is a patient. If this situation arises, the student must inform the clinical instructor, and arrangements will be made for a clinical experience on another unit. Clinical Absences and Tardiness A studen t who is absent or tardy in the clinical facility on the assigned day is expected to contact the clinical faculty member and or preceptor prior to the assigned reporting time. In addition, three (3) tardies will be equivalent to one (1) absence. Tardiness one hour after start time will be considered an absence unless previously arranged with clinical faculty. This notification is important because the patient must be reassigned as soon as possible; otherwise, the patient will be considered as abandoned, and legal consequences could result from an unanticipated hazardous situation. Students are expected to have 100% attendance for all laboratory experiences. The stated course objectives must be met in order to successfully pass the course. Students are expec ted to read and adhere to the course syllabus regarding clinical and class attendance. Missed clinical days cannot be \"made up.\" If a student misses a clinical day, the faculty member will take the absence under consideration to determine whether the stud ent will be able to fulfill all stated objectives. Twenty points will be deducted from the student's clinical evaluation for each absence. Accidents/Injuries If an accident or injury occurs while the student is in the clinical area, the student is responsible for following up on the necessary medical care. Faculty are to follow the clinical agency's policy for employee/student injuries, such as an incident report, emergency room treatment, etc. The Program Prior to NUR4945L Senior Practicum and/or NUR 4636C Communit y Health: Care of Communities, eligible RN -BSN students must complete and submit the Practicum Request Form. Students seeking readmission for final semester must: Meet the previous deadlines, Obtain approved readmission, And meet the final semester Excel sior exams, clinical clearance, and final semester registration request deadlines of December 1st, April 1st, and August 1st. 33 Chair and Director of Clinical Education mu st be notified, and NWCHNS clinical incident/blood - borne pathogen exposure policy must be followed. https://cnhs.fiu.edu/resources/students/clinicals -fieldwork/index.html - NWCNHS Bloodborne Exposure Policy Illness If a student needs health care and/or is at risk to others, the faculty member must determine appropriate action based on the individual ci rcumstances and make the proper referrals. Health care alternatives are treatment at the nearest walk -in facility, the FIU Student Health Clinic, or a private physician. Students who are ill must deliver medical clearance documents with no restrictions to the Director of Clinical Education and faculty before clinical can resume. Nursing Skill Deficiencies If the clinical faculty member identifies that a student is deficient in a specific skill, a lab prescription form will be completed and given to the student. The student must contact the Coordinator of the STAR (Simulation Teaching and Research) Center on the next class day to set up an appointment to w ork on the deficient skill. Practice and review must be completed within two weeks. General Expenses Expenses are incurred by all FIU students; however, undergraduate nursing students have some additional expenses, such as smart phones, personal computer w ith video/audio capability (which is strongly recommended for remote learning and for some virtual exercises), laboratory fees, uniform, stethoscope, penlight, watch with second hand, bandage scissors, name badge, goggles, personal audio plug -in (earphones ) for the computer, transportation, CPR certification, health screenings (including immunizations) and health insurance. These requirements not only protect students, staff, and patients, but also assist students in developing professional responsibility a nd accountability. CPR Certification . All students must have the current BLS CPR certification from American Heart Association before entering the clinical areas. College nursing personnel may be able to schedule a CPR certification class at the STAR Cent er for students. However, if a certification class cannot be scheduled (or a student cannot attend the class), the student is responsible for obtaining AHA BLS CPR certification in the community. CPR certification renewals are the responsibility of the stu dent. Immunizations/Health Screening Requirements . Periodically, all students must obtain specific immunizations, health screening tests, and background screening (such as TB tests, drug testing, fingerprints, and titers). The requirements are subject to change, depending upon current knowledge and practices relating to health care. Students should review the Complio website for the most updated information. Major Medical/Hospitalization Insurance . All students registered in clinical nursing courses must have major medical/hospitalization insurance (student health fees cover only routine health services). The College is required to send reports of immunizations and health -screening tests to clinical agencies where students will practice, and these tests must reach the clinical agency before the student is allowed RN-BSN students who are ill and unable to be in the clinical site on the assigned day are expected to contact the preceptor and the clinical faculty member prior to the assigned time of reporting. The student is then expected to meet with the preceptor and the faculty member to plan an appropriate make up assignment. Students failing to complete the assigned hours will receive a grade of \"F\" for the course. Tardiness in the clini cal area is an unprofessional behavior and will not be tolerated. If a tardy cannot be prevented, the student is expected to notify the preceptor and the faculty member. 34 to practice. If a requirement is due to expire during the upcoming semester, students must renew the requirement and upload it to Complio 2 weeks prior to the beginning of the semeste r. In addition, students must purchase NWCNHS approved goggles for eye protection. Students who do not have current and reported CPR certifications, immunizations, health screening tests, and health insurance will not be allowed in the clinical areas and may be dropped from the course. Clinical absences can impact fulfillment of the clinical course objectives. Background Checks All students must submit information for background screening as a requirement for clinical placement at health care facilities through Complio. Note: students who are younger than 21 years o ld by graduation and have never been employed in the United States do NOT need to complete the employment verification. Findings in background checks and drug screening may affect a student's ability to participate in clinical experiences, complete the pro gram, and/or obtain a registered nurse licensure. In addition, FIU's policies and procedures related to substance abuse may be affected. Students with an arrest history must disclose such history to the Chair of the NWCNHS Undergraduate Nursing Programs who will inform the Board of Nursing. Students must disclose arrests made before and after admission to the NWCNHS Chair or designee in writing. Background checks are performe d by the State on application for licensure and advanced certification and during the nursing program by clinical agencies. Failure to disclose can result in refusal of clinical agencies to host a student and a required appearance before the Board of Nursi ng and a significant delay (or possible denial) of a nursing license or advanced certification. CLINICAL DRESS GUIDELINES Uniform Purchase Uniforms will be worn in all clinical facilities , including the STAR Center, with variations as noted below.
