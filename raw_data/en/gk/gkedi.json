It's a process that combines controlled breathing and detailed body scanning to bring you into a state of heightened awareness and profound relaxation. The main purpose of NSDR is to reduce stress, enhance focus, and improve overall well-being. Begin your day with clarity and serenity with our morning meditation Promote better sleep, enhance focus, and create a calming atmosphere. Tune into our green noise track to promote relaxation and sleep create an optimal environment for focus, productivity, and efficient cognitive performance. NSDR is a powerful and zero cost tool that can help improve your sleep and overall well-being. Regular practice of Yoga Nidra can help reduce stress and anxiety, which can be major factors in preventing a good night's sleep. By practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing and body scans before bed, you can improve the quality of your sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and energized. The importance of good sleep cannot be overstated. Adequate and consistent sleep is essential for maintaining overall physical and mental health. During sleep, the body repairs itself and recharges for the next day. Poor sleep can lead to a variety of health issues, such as fatigue, poor concentration, and a weakened immune system. Furthermore, chronic sleep disorders have been linked to several chronic health conditions, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. For more info on improving sleep, see [Huberman's sleep stack](/post/andrew-hubermans-sleep-stack) NSDR is a powerful tool that can help you increase your focus and energy levels. Regular practice of Yoga Nidra can boost the release of dopamine in the brain, a chemical responsible for regulating mood, motivation, and attention. Dopamine is often referred to as the \"feel-good\" hormone, and it is associated with feelings of pleasure, motivation, and well-being. By practicing NSDR, you can learn to manage your stress and improve your overall mood, which in turn can lead to an increase in dopamine levels. This can help you feel more alert, focused and energized throughout the day. Struggling with feeling tired after waking up? Renowned neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman recommends Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) or yoga nidra. This practice induces deep relaxation while maintaining consciousness, making it a potent tool for stress management and mental clarity. NSDR shifts your brain from a state of stress to pure relaxation, stimulating serotonin release and activating the parasympathetic nervous system. This brain 'reset' improves memory, cognition, and sleep quality. Regular NSDR practice, preferably after an intense learning session, can be done with self-guided videos or apps like Reveri.Starting your NSDR journey is simple. Find a quiet, comfortable space, play your chosen guided video or track, and immerse yourself in the experience. NSDR not only enhances sleep quality but also fosters mental clarity, boosts cognitive function, and promotes mindfulness in daily life.This concise version retains key SEO-friendly keywords, answers potential user queries about NSDR, and is more digestible for users while providing all the necessary information about the practice. There's no need to overcomplicate the practice here. Simply lay down somewhere comfortable, or even sitting in a comfy desk chair. Find a free NSDR script, put on some good quality headphones and follow the track. The good thing about these scripts is that unlike meditation, they don't require a whole lot of focus - and this is the point. Trying it out is simple, scroll to the top or head to YouTube/Google. Non sleep deep rest is a behavioural tool that can be used in a range of different ways. Although the name suggests no-sleep - NSDR can be used to help fall asleep faster/get back to sleep. It can also be used to 'supplement' a bad nights sleep. Huberman uses NSDR the morning after a bad nights sleep. During the day, scripts can be used to increase focus and increase energy/motivation. Other forms of NSDR have a wider range of applications. All in all, NSDR doesn't need a specific application and can be used throughout the day. Two papers in iterations of [Cell Reports](https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/home) journal showed that a 20 minute NSDR protocol after an intense period of focused learning accelerates plasticity by 50%. This helps learn faster and the retention of new learnings is stronger. All in all, NSDR has been scientifically shown to accelerate learning. A study out of Denmark, using brain imaging, showed that a 30 minute NSDR/Yoga Nidra script, increased dopamine resting levels in the brain area called the striatum by 65%. Putting people into a state where they're ready for action when they come out. There's a few key times in the day you can do an NSDR script. Firstly, if you haven't had a good sleep the night before - maybe a couple hours less than usual, it's reported that an NSDR track first thing in the morning can improve the way you're feeling - even considering the rough night. Later on in the day, NSDR tracks have been shown to really help re-grain focus. NSDR tracks increase dopamine, and dopamine can help motivation/focus. Lastly, in the evening is a good time to practice non sleep deep rest. To relax before you head to bed for the evening, or if you're struggling to get off to sleep - or it's taking a while, you can put on an NSDR, do some breathwork and body scanning - and it may do the trick. Andrew Huberman, PhD is the creator of the Huberman Lab podcast. He is a neuro scientist and tenured professor in the department of Neurobiology at Stanford University's School of Medicine. Huberman has made significant contributions to the fields of brain development, brain function and neural plasticity. Huberman created the term NSDR and speaks about it frequently on his podcast, citing sources online to listen to NSDR tracks. NSDR.co is a site aiming to create an in-depth resource of NSDR tracks, along with other protocols such as Binaural beats and breathwork.
