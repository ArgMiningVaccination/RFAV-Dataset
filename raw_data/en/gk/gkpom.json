Views expressed herein do not reflect those of HLP or WCL.LETTER FROM THE EDITORS Welcome to the Fall 2012 issue of the Health Law & Policy Brief. Since our last edition, much has changed in the state of healthcare, both in the U.S. and abroad. The Supreme Court affirmed the right to affordable health coverage for every American in a highly publicized and highly controversial case decided in June. Internationally, significant crises in Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan, and other areas in the Middle East and Africa threaten the access to appropriate healthcare services for millions of individuals. Because of these challenges, it is more important than ever that healthcare issues be considered by politicians, lawyers, and human rights activists. This issue is a very special one, as it represents the culmination of intensive thought and collaborative effort by our authors, our staff members, the Washington College of Law (WCL), and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). Earlier this year, WCL joined with PAHO to organize and present the Inaugural Conference on Global Health, Gender and Human Rights, which featured a multitude of working groups on pressing global health and human rights issues. While the focus of the United States health law community this year has been inward-looking, scrutinizing the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, these working groups were very much outward-looking, providing a critical situational analysis of international public health, gender, and human rights concerns covering marginalized peoples who are often unable to speak out for themselves. Each of these working groups was guided by a white paper authored by WCL students in collaboration with PAHO advisors and global health law experts. These papers, further edited and refined, are presented in this issue of the Brief. The working groups then formulated a series of recommendations stemming from these white papers and their subsequent discussions; these recommendations are included at the end of each article as annexes, which we hope will assist policy makers and thought leaders in charting a better and more effective course for international health instruments and achieving health goals in developing societies. We are tremendously excited to be working so closely with PAHO, an organization with an illustrious record in the international health and human rights community. Through PAHO and a generous sponsorship from the Norwegian Embassy to Uruguay, this issue of the Brief will be translated in its entirety into Spanish, significantly furthering our international visibility and conveying more broadly the important messages contained within these pages. We hope that 2013 brings you good luck and good health. For questions or comments about the Brief , please contact us. Best regards, Jake & Katherineii Health Law & Policy BriefFOREWORD Shortly before his untimely death, Jonathan Mann called upon the fields of health and human rights to recognize their \"true interdependence and real interconnectedness.\"* This idea \u2014 that health and human rights are inextricably linked \u2014 was the organizing principle behind the Inaugural Conference on Global Health, Gender, and Human Rights which took place at American University Washington College of Law (WCL) on March 21 - 22, 2012. The Conference, co-organized by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and WCL, highlighted the interconnectedness of health and human rights by bringing together leaders from both fields and across the globe to grapple with some of the most pressing health and human rights challenges: how to ensure access to medicines and health information, how to control tobacco use, how to reduce maternal mortality, and how to protect the health and human rights of populations in situations of vulnerability. The interconnectedness of health and human rights is also central to the longstanding partnership between PAHO and WCL. In the past, law schools, medical schools, and universities often worked under the assumption that they were the \"only ones\" doing research, storing the products of their research in libraries, and for training students. But we have witnessed the breaking down of barriers and realignment of roles, and now more educational institutions recognize the importance of building strategic partnerships across institutions that share the common goals of promoting and protecting human rights and global health. It is our hope that the collaboration between PAHO and WCL will prove an important step towards the fulfillment of the right to health and other related human rights as established in the health agenda for the Americas 2008-2017 and PAHO Resolution CD50R8 \"Health and Human Rights.\" It will also support PAHO Member States, international agencies, civil society organizations, the private sector, and universities in their effort to promote health in all policies and develop goals in a manner consistent with universal and regional human rights treaties and standards. In addition to valuing PAHO and WCL ' s close partnership, we are grateful for the generous support of the following organizations and individuals in realizing this Conference and special edition of the Health Law & Policy Brief: the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Guatemala, WCL alumnus Joel Michaels, United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to health, Anand Grover, as well as the distinguished panelists; Working Group facilitators and participants; Corrine Parver, and Cristina Leria; and our Conference fellows, many of whom were WCL students who managed to write the outstanding works featured herein despite heavy course loads and the rigors of law school. Their hard work and commitment bodes well for the future of the legal profession and Jonathan Mann' s vision. That is a good thing, for we still have a lot of work to do. While there have been important developments in health systems reform in a manner consistent with human rights instruments, we are far from where we need to be. We need a concerted effort from governments, civil society, human rights treaty bodies, universities, international agencies, and other actors in order to create societies where human beings can fully enjoy their right to the highest attainable standard of health and other related human rights, and can develop themselves to their full potential. We hope the Conference and this issue of the Brief will push us even further in that direction and help move us closer to the full enjoyment of well-being and a world in which all humankind benefits from our interdependence and our interconnectedness.

INTRODUCTION TO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND IMP ART INFORMATION ON HEALTH Since its very inception, the United Nations (UN) has shown concern about the effects that withholding information has on individuals and their development as human beings. In 1946, during the first session of the UN General Assembly, the Member States recognized freedom of information as a fundamental human right and the touchstone of all freedoms.1 This recognition was made formal when, two years later, the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Universal Declaration), consisting of thirty articles that represent the basic rights and freedoms to which all human beings are entitled and which every Member State has undertaken to protect. Among the rights and freedoms listed in the Universal Declaration are (1) the right to receive and impart information and (2) the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health. This paper explores the connection between these rights, and highlights the effect that their nexus has on the well-being of individuals in the context of their sexual and reproductive health, gender identities, tobacco use and exposure, disability, ageing, and access to medicines. II. THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND IMP ART INFORMATION IN THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION, THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS, AND THE AMERICAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS The right to receive and impart information is enshrined in international human rights law. In Article 19 of the Universal Declaration, the UN General Assembly proclaimed that \"[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.\"2 In similar words, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which has the force of international law and is binding on all ratifying States, also protects the right to receive and impart information. In Article 19(2), the State Parties to the ICCPR recognized that \"[e]veryone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.\"3 The right to receive and impart information has been reaffirmed in regional instruments as well. For example, the Organization of American States (OAS) adopted the American Convention on Human Rights (American Convention), in which it recognized that \"[e]veryone has the right to freedom of thought and expression.\"4 In Article 13 of the American Convention, the OAS explained that this right * Carlos Y . Cueto Diaz, a third-year law student at Tulane Law School, has worked on a variety of human rights projects both at home and abroad throughout his career. This article is based on a paper that was presented at the Inaugural Conference on Global Health, Gender, and Human Rights, sponsored by the American University Washington College of Law, Pan American Health Organization, and the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Guatemala. The paper was written in consultation with Sandra Del Pino, PAHO Human Rights Specialist and Marcelo D'Agostino, PAHO Knowledge Management and Communication Manager. Alejandro Morlachetti, PAHO Consultant on Human Rights, reviewed an earlier version of this paper. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the individual authors and do not necessarily represent the position of PAHO, the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Guatemala, the Health Law & Policy Brief, or the American University Washington College of Law.2 Health Law & Policy Briefencompasses the freedom to convey both information and ideas, regardless of form and medium.5 By adopting these documents, the international community effectively placed the right to receive and impart information at the center of international human rights law, and thereby acknowledged, as the UN General Assembly had done in 1946, the role of freedom of information as \"an essential factor in any serious effort to promote the peace and progress of the world.\"6 III. THE RIGHT TO THE ENJOYMENT OF THE HIGHEST ATTAINABLE STANDARD OF HEALTH IN THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION, THE INTERNATIONAL COVENANT ON ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL RIGHTS, AND THE PROTOCOL OF SAN SAL V ADOR The right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health (\"right to health\") is also at the center of international human rights law. Article 25(1) of the Universal Declaration proclaimed that \"[e]veryone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services ....\"7 Similarly, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), which also has the force of international law and is binding on all ratifying States, recognized in Article 12(1) \"the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\"8 The right to health has been revalidated at the regional level. Almost twenty years after the adoption of the American Convention, the OAS supplemented its provisions with the passage of the Protocol of San Salvador (\"the Protocol\"). In Article 10 of the Protocol, the OAS affirmed that \"[e]veryone shall have the right to health, understood to mean the enjoyment of the highest level of physical, mental and social well-being.\"9 As I will discuss below, the right to health does not exist in a vacuum. Instead, it must be interpreted to encompass all other related human rights, including, but not limited to, the right to receive and impart information.IV . CONNECTION BETWEEN THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND IMP ART INFORMATION AND THE RIGHT TO HEALTH An intrinsic characteristic of all human rights is that they are interdependent on each other; that is, each human right is indispensable for the exercise and enjoyment of other human rights.10 The right to health is no exception, and acts in synergy with other human rights such as the right to receive and impart information.11 In other words, a certain degree of physical and mental health is necessary to exercise the right to receive and impart information, at the same time, the protection and exercise of the right to information is essential to achieving a genuine physical and mental well-being.12 For this reason, a violation or failure to enforce and protect the right to receive and impart information may adversely affect the physical, mental, and social well-being of all people.13 More than three decades after the adoption of the ICESCR, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (\"the Committee\") endorsed this view in General Comment No. 14, which addressed substantive issues arising in the implementation of Article 12 of the ICESCR. In interpreting the meaning of the provisions of this article, the Committee explained that the right to health is neither the right to be healthy nor the right to health care. Instead, the Committee expressed that the right to health is concerned with the promotion of conditions under which people can lead healthy lives.14 Whether such conditions exist depends on the confluence of a wide range of socio economic factors, also known as \"underlying determinants of health.\"15 These factors include \"access to safe and potable water and adequate sanitation, an adequate supply of safe food, nutrition and housing, healthy occupational and environmental conditions, and access to health- related education and information, including on sexual and reproductive health. \"16 For this reason, the right to health must be interpreted as requiring the creation, promotion, and protection of conditions in the form of facilities, goods, and services that are necessary for the realization of the highest attainable standard of health.\"173 Winter 2013The right to receive and impart information on health is an integral element of the right to health and one of the conditions necessary for its fulfillment. As the Committee unambiguously noted in General Comment No. 14, the right to health is closely related to, and dependent upon, the realization of other human rights such as the rights to education and access to information.18 With this in mind, the Committee laid out the three types of obligations that the right to health imposes on State parties: the obligations to respect , protect , and fulfill .19 In particular, a State respects the right to health when its national government does not censor, withhold, or intentionally misrepresent health- related information, including sexual education and information.20 Additionally, the government protects the right to health by making sure that third parties within its territory do not curtail people' s access to health information and services.21 Finally, the government fulfills the right to health by providing its people with the tools necessary to make informed decisions about their health.22 These tools include \"information relating to healthy lifestyles and nutrition, harmful traditional practices and the availability of services.\"23 In other words, the State parties must ensure that individuals are able to exercise, without encumbrances, their \"right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas concerning health issues\"24 if they are to achieve the highest attainable standard of health. The deliberate withholding or misrepresentation of information vital to health protection or treatment \u2014 as well as any other action, policy, or law that contravenes Article 12 \u2014 constitutes a violation of the obligations of the State parties under the ICESCR.25 V . ASSESSMENT BY SPECIAL RAPPORTEURS OF THE IMP ACT OF THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND IMP ART INFORMATION ON HEALTH Since the establishment of its mandate in 1993, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression has been concerned with the concept and meaning of the right to information. In 1995, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression stated that one of the most essential elements of freedom of speech is the right to seek accessible information.26 According to him, \"[f]reedom will be bereft of all effectiveness if the people have no access to information.\"27 For this reason, he recognized that the long-standing government practice of withholding information from the people must be eradicated.28 Three years later, in 1998, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression moved away from the interpretation of the right to information as an element of freedom of expression, and began to refer to it as a legally enforceable right in and of itself.29 He then added that the right to access to information held by governments \"must be the rule rather than the exception.\"30 In more recent years, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression has embraced the idea that the right to information is necessarily connected to the right to health. In 2002, for example, he highlighted the crucial role that information and education programs play in the fight against HIV/ AIDS.31 However, he regretted that, while the major players in the fight against HIV/AIDS believe that education and information play an important role in the prevention of the epidemic, a connection has yet to be made between the effectiveness of education and information programs and the effective exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression.32 The failure to appreciate this nexus is worrisome because practice shows that where the right to freedom of opinion and expression is guaranteed and protected, information and education campaigns are more effective.33 For this reason, the Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression deemed imperative that communities, associations of people living with HIV/AIDS, teachers, journalists, doctors, self-help groups, among other stakeholders in the fight against HIV/AIDS, be allowed to implement information, education, and other awareness-raising campaigns addressing all HIV/AIDS-related issues.36 In addition to covering these issues, the campaigns must also reach all groups in situation of vulnerability, such as women and young people, men having sex with men, men and women working in prostitution, and intravenous drug users.35 In the context of information that is sensitive or private, such as safe sex or drug use, the means through which that information is conveyed should be 4 Health Law & Policy Brieftailored to the target audience taking into consideration its age group, sex, and other relevant factors, including whether the audience is composed of men and women working in prostitution or drug users.36 Along the same line, the Special Rapporteur on the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health (\"the Special Rapporteur on the right to health\") has emphasized the nexus between access to information and health standards. In 2002, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special Rapporteur on the right to health issued a joint statement in which they stated that ensuring access to treatment, care, and support is as important as ensuring access to appropriate information and education.37 In subsequent years, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health consistently stressed that the right to health includes access to information. In 2009, the right to information was directly linked to the concept of informed consent, which was then defined as a \"voluntary and sufficiently informed decision, protecting the right of the patient to be involved in medical decision-making, and assigning associated duties and obligations to health-care providers[.]\"38 This concept \"invokes several elements of human rights that are indivisible, interdependent and interrelated.\"39 In addition to the right to health, these elements include the right to receive and impart information. Completeness of information is among the required components of informed consent. In other words, \"[i]nformed consent requires disclosure of the associated benefits, risks and alternatives to a medical procedure.\"40 Without this information, patients are not fully enabled to consent, and no consent so given may be deemed valid. To guarantee informed consent is to respect the autonomy, self-determination, and human dignity of individuals.41 As further stressed by the Special Rapporteur on the right to health in 2011, it shall constitute a violation of a patient' s right to health to act, or fail to act, in a way that deprives that patient from the information he or she needs to provide informed consent.42 Therefore, the right to receive and impart information on health, as a central component of informed consent, is an integral part of respecting, protecting, and fulfilling the right to health as elaborated in Article 12 of the ICESCR, and as and enshrined in other international and regional human rights instruments.43 VI. LEGAL LIMITATIONS TO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND IMP ART INFORMATION IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC HEALTH No legal right is an absolute right. The right to freedom of thought and expression, as all other legal rights, may be subject to a series of restrictions. Article 13 of the American Convention establishes the conditions required for restrictions imposed on this right to be considered legitimate: The exercise of the right [to freedom of thought and expression] shall not be subject to prior censorship but shall be subject to subsequent imposition of liability, which shall be expressly established by law to the extent necessary to ensure: (a) respect for the rights or reputations of others; or (b) the protection of national security, public order, or public health or morals.44 Any inquiry into the legitimacy of these limitations shall be done on a case-by-case basis and considering the totality of the circumstances.45 The OAS Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression has expressed that \"the standards for the admissibility of restrictions are applied to all of the constitutive elements of freedom of expression in its diverse manifestations.\"46 Therefore, limitations imposed upon an individual' s ability to receive and impart information must meet the aforementioned conditions.47 Along the same line, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (Inter-American Commission) has established the principle that \"[e] very person has the right to access ... information about himself or herself,\"48 and that \"[a]ccess to information held by the state is a fundamental right of every individual.\"49 For this reason, and subject to the limitations set forth in the American Convention, States have no choice but to guarantee the full exercise of this right.50 In the landmark case of Claude-Reyes et al. v. Chile , the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (Inter-5 Winter 2013American Court) also placed the right to receive and impart information on an equal footing with other recognized human rights, including for purposes of the restrictions that apply to it: [T]he Court finds that, by expressly stipulating the right to 'seek' and 'receive' 'information,' Article 13 of the Convention protects the right of all individuals to request access to State -held information, with the exceptions permitted by the restrictions established in the Convention. Consequently, this article protects the right of the individual to receive such information and the positive obligation of the State to provide it, so that the individual may have access to such information or receive an answer that includes a justification when, for any reason permitted by the Convention, the State is allowed to restrict access to the information in a specific case.51 In doing so, the Inter American Court reiterated that, pursuant to Article 2 of the American Convention, States must eliminate norms and practices of any type that result in violations of the right to receive and impart information.52 In addition, the Inter-American Commission has expressed that States must adopt the necessary measures to protect the right of access to information, especially in the context of health- related issues such as reproduction.53 Ultimately, it is well established that the exercise of the right to receive and impart information on health can only be denied, as stipulated in Article 13 of the American Convention, to protect the rights of others and public order, which includes the issues of national security, public health, and morals.54 The Inter-American Commission has stressed that the aforementioned purposes \"are the only objectives authorized by the Convention, [and] the limitations must be necessary to achieve imperative public interests that, because of their importance in specific cases, clearly prevail over the social need for the full enjoyment of freedom of expression protected by Article 13.\"55 In this regard, the Inter- American Court has explained that, when public order is cited as a reason for a limitation, the order defended must not be authoritarian in nature. Instead, \"public order\" refers to \"a democratic order understood as the existence of the structural conditions that enable all people to exercise their rights in freedom, with neither discrimination nor fear of punishment as a consequence thereof.\"56 Moreover, any such invocation of \"public order\" must be based on \"real and objectively verifiable causes,\" which pose a \"certain and credible threat of a potentially serious disturbance of the basic conditions for the functioning of democratic institutions.\"57 Therefore, States may neither invoke conjectures regarding possible disturbances nor rely on hypothetical circumstances to justify limiting the people' s right to receive and impart information on health.58 VII. RELEV ANT BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO STRENGTHEN AND PROTECT THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE AND IMP ART INFORMATION ON HEALTH The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) has identified a series of barriers to improving equity in health, including the assurance of a free and unimpaired exercise of the right to receive and impart information on health. Some of these barriers include, but are not limited to, the lack of expertise in the underlying determinants of health, which include access to health-related information.59 Other significant barriers are the generalized ignorance of international human rights provisions, and the limited knowledge in national ministries and secretariats of health, as well as among civil society organizations, about existing obligations and implementation measures in the aforementioned human rights instruments.60 Lastly, the limited implementation of national mechanisms to promote and protect the right to health and other related human rights, such as the right to receive and impart information on health, also presents a serious challenge to PAHO' s efforts to improve equity in health,61 which includes the reduction of morbidity and mortality; the improvement of health during key stages of life, including pregnancy, childbirth, the neonatal period, childhood, and adolescence; the improvement of sexual and reproductive health; and the promotion of active and healthy aging for all individuals.62 The opportunities identified by PAHO to overcome the aforementioned barriers include the continuing support, through technical cooperation with its 6 Health Law & Policy BriefMember States, to improve the information systems in sexual and reproductive health, as well as in maternal, neonatal, child, adolescent, and older adult health.63 In addition, PAHO recognizes the importance of strengthening the foundation upon which civil society organizations stand by providing training on health and human rights and supporting the implementation of awareness campaigns, as well as the dissemination of relevant health- related information.64 To this end, PAHO adopted a resolution urging its Member States to train health workers on the international human rights instruments dealing with the right to health and other related human rights.65 PAHO also recommended that Member States disseminate these instruments among the legislative and judicial branches, as well as among civil society organizations and other relevant social actors.66 In addition to PAHO, the Inter-American Commission has recognized a series of barriers to the right to receive and impart information on health. These barriers include, but are not limited to, the equally important right to freedom of conscience. Article 18 of the ICCPR establishes that \"[e]veryone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion,\"67 which includes the \"freedom ... to manifest his religion or belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.\"68 However, Article 18 goes on to stress that freedom of conscience may be subject to limitations arising from the need to protect public safety and order, as well as the health, morals and the fundamental rights and freedoms of others.69 The Inter-American Commission has interpreted this provision to mean that, \"while healthcare professionals demand respect for their right to conscience, they must also show equal respect for their patients' rights to conscience.\"70 The Inter-American Commission recognizes the challenges posed by the fact that health professionals, not unlike their patients, have their own convictions with respect to family planning, emergency oral contraception, sterilization, and abortion.71 In addition, deeply rooted religious beliefs, personal preferences, or even plain ignorance, may make them take a strong stance against LGBTI persons, persons living with HIV/AIDS, and other persons in situation of vulnerability. To reconcile the conflict between the health professionals' right to freedom conscience and that of the patients they see, the Inter-American Commission suggests that balance be stricken through referrals: In other words, a health professional may refuse to take care of a patient, but should transfer the patient without objection to another health professional who can provide what the patient is seeking. For example, if a woman needs family planning information and services and/or other lawful reproductive health services, and the health professional has his or her own convictions with respect to the utilization of such services, the professional has the obligation to refer the patient to another health provider who can provide the information and services in question.72 Finally, the European Court of Human Rights (European Court) has also addressed the issue of conscientious objection. In Pichon and Sajous v. France , the European Court faced allegations that pharmacists had refused to sell birth control pills because doing so would have been against their religious beliefs.73 In that case, the European Court held that where a health practice or service is legal, health professionals may not allow their religious beliefs to stand as a barrier between their patients and the legal practice or service sought.74 In holding so, the European Court reasoned that health professionals remain free to exercise their beliefs in whichever way they choose outside the professional setting.75 In the related case of R.R. v. Poland , the European Court added that States \"are obliged to organise the health services system in such a way as to ensure that an effective exercise of the freedom of conscience of health professionals in the professional context does not prevent patients from obtaining access to services to which they are entitled under the applicable legislation.\"76 VIII. FOCUS AREAS A. Sexual and reproductive health As seen above, the right to receive and impart information is essential to the attainment of the highest quality of sexual and reproductive health. 7 Winter 2013Pursuant to Article 12(2)(a) of the ICESCR, States are required to enact \"measures to improve child and maternal health, sexual and reproductive health services, including [...] access to information , as well as to resources necessary to act on that information.\"77 The Special Rapporteur on the right to health has also linked information and health in the context of sexual and reproductive health issues. In 2004, he reminded States of their obligations in the areas of reproductive health and maternal and child health services.78 Particularly, States should be committed to providing and improving a wide range of sexual and reproductive health services, such as \"access to family planning, pre- and post-natal care, emergency obstetric services, and access to information .\"79 Furthermore, he interpreted the prohibition against discrimination to include the duty to ensure that health information and services are made available to groups in situation of vulnerability.80 The Special Rapporteur on the right to health also underscored in that year' s report the need to empower women to make decisions that affect their sexual and reproductive health81 \u2014 an empowerment which necessarily depends on the unimpaired access to sexual and reproductive health information. For example, he pointed out that unsafe abortions kill approximately 68,000 women each year.82 To prevent this, he advised that \"women with unwanted pregnancies should be offered reliable information ... , including information on where and when a pregnancy may be terminated legally.\"83 Interestingly, States can achieve significant improvements in this context even when resources are scarce.84 An example of this is the case of Sri Lanka, where important advances have been made over the last decades in relation to sexual and reproductive health by improving education and increasing female literacy, among other measures.85 In addition, the repeal of laws such as those that criminalize abortion is not tied to resource constraints.86 Therefore, a simple cost-benefit analysis would seem to indicate that such laws must be immediately removed to facilitate women' s access to information and to ensure the full enjoyment of their right to health.87In 2006, the Special Rapporteur on the right to health highlighted again the nexus between information and health by stressing that the right to health entitles women to information on sexual and reproductive health.\"88 In that year' s report, he approvingly noted the \"three delays\" model, which suggests that maternal mortality is due to delays in: (1) deciding to seek appropriate medical help for an obstetric emergency; (2) reaching an appropriate facility; and (3) receiving adequate care when a facility is reached.89 According to him, poor education and lack of access to information contribute negatively to the first delay.90 To the extent that women lack the tools necessary to identify an emergency and to make an informed and reasoned decision as to where to seek services, they unavoidably become exposed to a greater risk of maternal mortality. B. Gender identities The guiding principle of non-discrimination in international human rights law stands for the idea that individuals must be able to enjoy the full spectrum of human rights without distinction on the basis of certain enumerated grounds, including, but not limited to, sex. In General Comment No. 14, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (\"the Committee\") explained that the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of sex also precludes States from discriminating against individuals in access to health care and underlying determinants of health, such as the right to receive and impart information, on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.91 Echoing the Committee' s opinion, the Human Rights Committee (CCPR) held in Toonen v. Australia that a distinction between individuals on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity amounted to a violation of Article 2 of the ICCPR.92 In that case, the CCPR faced allegations that Tasmania engaged in \"a campaign of official and unofficial hatred\" against LGBTI persons. In its opinion, the CCPR noted that this campaign has made it difficult for the Tasmanian Gay Law Reform Group to disseminate information about its activities and advocate the decriminalization of homosexuality.\"93 The CCPR ultimately rejected the Tasmanian government' s argument that its laws criminalizing homosexuality were justified on public health grounds as part of 8 Health Law & Policy Brieftheir effort to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS.94 The CCPR held that \"the criminalization of homosexual practices cannot be considered a reasonable means or proportionate measure to achieve the aim of preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS.\"95 In doing so, the CCPR observed that \"statutes criminalizing homosexual activity tend to impede public health programmes by driving underground many of the people at the risk of infection.\"96 Therefore, the CCPR emphasized that the \"criminalization of homosexual activity ... would appear to run counter to the implementation of effective education programmes in respect of the HIV/AIDS prevention.\"97 Despite the Toonen decision, many countries continue to criminalize homosexual behavior. In his report to the Human Rights Council (HRC), the Special Rapporteur on the right to health noted that there were, as of 2010, eighty countries in which consensual same-sex conduct is punishable by law, and that many countries also penalized individuals merely because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.98 He then warned that these laws have the effect of substantially diminishing the self- worth and dignity of individuals, and thus prevent the realization of the right to health, as outlined in Article 12 of the ICESCR, and other related human rights.99 Among these related human rights is the right to seek and receive information on health. A natural consequence of criminalization is the perpetuation of existing prejudices and stereotypes, which prevent otherwise-able institutions from properly addressing the concerns of LGBTI persons.100 For example, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (\"the Manual\"), which is published by the American Psychiatric Association and standardizes the criteria for the classification of mental disorders, retained homosexuality as a mental disorder until very recently.101 However, other so-called \"gender identity disorders\" are still included in the Manual.102 This is the case, for example, of transvestic fetishism.103 According to the Manual, transvestites should be treated with psychotherapy aimed at uncovering and working through the underlying causes of their behavior, without regard to the possible discomfort that they may feel because of their gender identity.104 Such attempts to cure are inappropriate, cause significant psychological distress, and, based on a well-founded fear of prosecution, make it less likely that LGBTI persons seek health-related information.105 C. Tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke Tobacco has also been at the center of this discussion. In 2003, the World Health Assembly adopted the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) as a response to the rapid increase of tobacco consumption throughout the world. In Article 3, the FCTC states that its objective is \"to protect present and future generations from the devastating health, social, environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke ....\"106 To achieve this objective, the Parties to the FCTC must ensure that information regarding the consequences of tobacco consumption and exposure are widely available.107 To this end, Article 10 mandates the Parties to adopt and implement effective measures requiring manufacturers and importers of tobacco products to disclose to governmental authorities and the general public information about the contents and emissions of tobacco products.108 Article 12 further develops the duty of public disclosure by elaborating on the requirements of education, communication, and training: the three pillars of public awareness.109 More specifically, the Parties are required to carry out programs on the health risks of tobacco, the benefits of a tobacco- free lifestyle, and the environmental consequences of tobacco production and consumption to educate, communicate with, and train the public.110 For purposes of the FCTC, \" education comprises a continuum of teaching and learning about tobacco which empowers people to make voluntary decisions, modify their behavior and change social conditions in ways that enhance health.\"111 Along the same line, \"communication is essential to change attitudes about tobacco production, manufacture, marketing, consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke, discourage tobacco use, curb smoking initiation, and encourage cessation, as well as being necessary for effective community mobilization towards providing enabling environments and achieving sustainable social change.\"112 Finally, \" training describes the 9 Winter 2013process of building and sustaining the necessary capacity for a comprehensive tobacco-control programme through attaining vocational or practical skills and knowledge that relate to specific core competencies.\"113 Education, communication, and training are the means of raising public awareness regarding the adverse effects of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke.114 As a working group for the FCTC has advised, the right to health requires that social norms provide enabling environments in which people can lead a tobacco-free lifestyle.115 This creates a duty to educate, communicate with, and train people to ensure a high level of public awareness of tobacco control, the harms of tobacco production, consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke, and the strategies and practices of the tobacco industry to undermine tobacco control efforts.116 D. Disability The UN adopted the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (\"the Convention\") in 2006 to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity.117 To achieve this objective, the Parties to the Convention must ensure that persons with disabilities have the information they need regarding mobility aids and devices, assistive technologies, and other forms of assistance, support services, and facilities.118 This obligation goes to the core of the concept of accessibility, which, as outlined in Article 9 of the Convention, requires Parties to enable persons with disabilities to lead a fully independent and participative life.119 Accessibility, as described above, is strictly connected to the freedoms of expression, opinion, and access to information. More specifically, Parties must ensure that persons with disabilities are able to exercise the right to freedom of expression and opinion, which includes \"the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas on an equal basis with others and through all forms of communication of their choice.\"120 These measures should include a guarantee that persons with disabilities have access to information intended for the general public in accessible formats and appropriate technologies, in a timely manner, and at no additional cost.121 In addition, Parties must facilitate the use of the appropriate means, modes, and formats of communication in official interactions with the government, including sign languages, Braille, and augmentative and alternative communication.122 E. Ageing The Second World Assembly on Ageing adopted the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing (\"the Madrid Plan\") in 2002. The objective of the Madrid Plan is \"to respond to the opportunities and challenges of population ageing in the twenty-first century and to promote the development of a society for all ages.\"123 One of the major challenges identified by the Madrid Plan relates to the human rights of older persons: \"The promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms ... is essential for the creation of an inclusive society for all ages in which older persons participate fully and without discrimination and on the basis of equality.\"124 The right to receive and impart information on health is at the center of the Madrid Plan. This document suggests that policymakers \"[p]rovide information and access to facilitate the participation of older persons in mutual self-help, intergenerational community groups and opportunities for realizing their full potential.\"125 In addition, policymakers should implement information campaigns that address older persons on topics such as unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and other unhealthy behaviors.126 Other topics may include, for example, the symptoms, treatment, consequences, and prognosis of mental diseases, as well as the prevention and management of disabilities.127 Soon after the passage of the Madrid Plan, the UN General Assembly endorsed its suggestions and reaffirmed the commitment of the international community to safeguard the security and dignity of persons as they age, ensuring that they continue to participate in their societies as citizens with full rights.128 More recently, the UN General Assembly recognized the need for ensuring that older persons have access to information about their rights to enable them to fully and justly participate in society.12910 Health Law & Policy BriefThe OAS has also pledged to protects the rights of older persons. Last year, for example, the OAS urged its Member States to take action to make older persons, their families, and caregivers aware of their rights and responsibilities.130 Such information awareness campaigns would, in turn, contribute \"to uphold the dignity and safeguard the physical, mental and social well being of older persons.\"131 F. Access to medicines The international obligation of States with regards to medicines is comprised of four different elements; that is, States must ensure that medicines are (1) available, (2) accessible, (3) culturally acceptable, and (4) of good quality.132 One of the dimensions of the requirement of availability deals with the issue of access to information. More specifically, \"reliable information about medicines must be accessible to patients and health professionals so they can take well- informed decisions and use medicines safely.\"133 This requirement is directly connected to the issue of informed consent, as explained above, and requires that accurate and appropriate information about medicines is made available to health professionals and the general public alike.134 In addition to being essential to informed consent, the unimpaired access to information about medicines is paramount in the fight against corruption. According to the Special Rapporteur on the right to health, corruption is endemic in some medicine supply systems.135 For example, \"[p]roducts are diverted; unofficial 'fees' are required for customs clearance; counterfeit medicines are permitted to circulate and so on.\"136 To protect these systems, States must ensure that health professionals, patients and their families, and the general public are able to freely exercise their right to receive and impart information about medicines.137 By doing so, States will help to create a more transparent environment, which could eventually lead to the elimination of corruption in health systems and, in particular, in medicine supply systems.138 IX. CONCLUSIONS Every UN Member State has undertaken various international legal obligations with respect to human rights. These obligations include, but are not limited to, the duty to ensure that their citizens are able to freely and fully exercise their right to the highest attainable standard of health. This right to health, as it is commonly known, is intrinsically connected to other human rights, including the right to information. Because the ability of an individual to access information regarding his/her health is a determinant factor in his/her well-being, the rights to health and information must be seen as dependant on each other. In particular, individuals have a right to receive and impart information on health. Their ability or inability to exercise such a right will directly affect their well-being. As seen in the focus areas above, the right to receive and impart information on health plays an important role in the ability of individuals, especially women, to receive adequate sexual and reproductive health services. For example, their access to information regarding family planning, pre- and post-natal care, emergency obstetric services may be impaired by governmental policy or for religious reasons, or for both. This is particularly worrisome in the context of access to contraceptive measures and abortion, which face direct opposition from secular governments and private groups. The right to receive and impart information on health needs special protection in the context of gender identities. As seen above, many countries continue to criminalize consensual same-sex conduct, which drives individuals underground and away from the reach of public health policies, plans, and programs. This is achieved by passing laws that directly prohibit any sort of homosexual activity, including, but not limited to, the dissemination of information of interest to LGBTI persons. As the Human Rights Committee held, no such policy may be justified on public health grounds. Instead, such policies are proven to run counter to the implementation of effective education programs on disease prevention and other public health priorities. The tobacco industry, in its effort to disseminate the consumption of tobacco products, has also tried to diminish the right of individuals to receive and impart information. States, in turn, must respond by engaging in education, communication, and training efforts to raise public awareness regarding 11 Winter 2013the adverse effects of tobacco consumption and exposure to tobacco smoke. The dissemination of information in this context may lead to the shaping of social norms and attitudes toward tobacco, and to the eventual creation of environments which are conducive to the full achievement of the highest standard of health in all populations. The right to receive and impart information on health is also linked to the issues of disability and ageing. To promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights of persons with disability and older persons, these individuals must be able to access information that is relevant to their needs. In the case of persons with disabilities, for example, States have the duty to provide information regarding appropriate forms of assistance and support on an equal basis with others and through all forms of communication of their choice. Alternatively, older persons must be able to access information on health- related topics, such as adequate diets and physical exercises, so as facilitate their participation in mutual self-help, intergenerational community groups, and opportunities for realizing their full potential. In regard to access to medicines, States must not only ensure that medicines are available, accessible, culturally acceptable, and of good quality; in addition, they must ensure that reliable information about medicines is accessible to health professionals and patients. By doing so, health professionals will be better able to provide transparent services to their patients, who in turn will be better equipped to give health professionals their consent to a treatment or procedure. Finally, the unimpaired dissemination of information will undoubtedly create a more informed consumer base, which is an essential tool in the worldwide fight against corruption in medicine supply systems. For the reasons outlined above, States should take immediate and improved action to remove the barriers and exploit the opportunities of the right to receive and impart information. Some of these barriers may relate to ignorance of international and regional human rights and instruments, or to the refusal by health professionals to offer services on the basis of their religious or personal beliefs. In either case, the removal of the barrier is not tied to significant financial considerations. Opportunities for removal are grounded, for example, on educational campaigns and training sessions that educate all relevant actors on the relationship between human rights and health. In addition, the issue of conscientious objection could be easily addressed through the use of referrals so as to permit the unimpaired flow of health-related services and information. Not only would the relative cost of these remedial actions be minimal to the individual States (especially in light of PAHO' s cooperation), but the benefits of such actions would be enjoyed by the full range of their populations: men and women, including children and older persons; whether heterosexual or members of the LGBTI community; smokers or non- smokers; healthy, sick or disabled. 1 Calling of an International Conference on Freedom of Information, \u00b6 1, U.N.

Group 4: Gender identities Dissemination of information to fight stigmatization and misinformation about the concept and meaning of gender identities; Emphasize that accurate information is crucial to prevent and abolish criminalization of certain conducts and practices related to sex; Provide appropriate information on human rights to high level officials with the support of American University legal clinics, PAHO, and the relevant networks, including Redlactrans, to achieve the decriminalization of certain sex conducts.16 Health Law & Policy BriefGroup 5: Maternal mortality Dissemination of pertinent information on scientific evidence of the non-abortive characteristic of emergency contraception to judges, parliamentarians, and public health personnel; Dissemination of relevant information to women, girls, and adolescents in situation of vulnerability, such as those that are deprived of liberty in prisons, juvenile centers, psychiatric hospitals, etc. Group 6: Disabilities Emphasize that access to appropriate information is key with regard to legal capacity as defined in the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD); Provide information to people with disabilities, families, parents, and associations about their rights; Provide information via materials and training to guardians and judges to avoid practices and decisions that unnecessarily restrict the capacity of persons living with disabilities to exercise civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights in violation of the CRPD; Dissemination of information about the obligations that Governments have accepted when ratifying the CRPD, including the recommendations of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.17 Winter 2013FOllOWing pROTOcO l: ThE ROlE OF human RighTs laW in REDucing maTER nal mORT aliTy Jeryl D. Hayes, JD, LL.M., Lidia Susana Gomez, LL.B.* Women' s reproductive health risks are not mere misfortunes and unavoidable natural disadvantages of pregnancy, but rather injustices that societies are able and obligated to remedy.1 I. INTRODUCTION Each year at least 350,000 women around the world die from complications related to pregnancy.2 Although pregnancy is not a disease, roughly 1,400 women die each day from causes such as hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia, obstructed delivery, unsafe abortions, or post-abortion complications.3 Most of these deaths are entirely preventable. Ensuring access to health services, including emergency obstetric care and skilled birth attendants, meeting the need for contraception, and eliminating unsafe abortions could reduce the maternal death rate by almost eighty percent-saving the lives and health of hundreds of thousands of women per year.4These interventions succeed by lowering the risks associated with pregnancy for many women around the world. In contrast however, women living in developing nations face unacceptably high risks. As the World Bank notes, \"for every 100,000 live births in West Africa, 629 mothers die, compared to only seven in Western Europe.\"5 Even more troubling, women from merely six nations-Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria and Pakistan-account for at least half of all maternal deaths.6 These grossly uneven rates of maternal mortality demonstrate that the baseline risks in pregnancy are significantly exacerbated by social, economic and political inequality. Within nations, marginalized women are at greater risk of maternal death than women with access to resources, again demonstrating that maternal mortality is not necessary. Risk of maternal death is strongly correlated with characteristics such as: age, poverty, race, indigenous status, residence in a rural area, or other conditions of vulnerability including incarceration, HIV/AIDS and prostitution.7 These relationships expose intersectional social inequalities. Adolescents and young women are at particular risk for maternal death. According to the UNFPA, Complications during pregnancy or childbearing are the leading cause of death for girls aged 15-19 in developing countries. Approximately 16 million girls aged 15-19 give birth each year. Girls under the age of 15 are five times more likely to die from maternal causes. Girls aged 15-19 account for 15% of unsafe abortions \u2014 which adds up to three million each year.8 Teen pregnancies are much more likely to result in maternal death or injury because adolescents are both more vulnerable to unsafe abortions and less likely to seek appropriate care in the event * Jeryl D.

WHY HUMAN RIGHTS? States and international bodies have created global and regional initiatives to reduce maternal mortality. The best-known of these initiatives is Millennium Development Goal 5 (MDG 5), which laid out a target of reducing the global maternal mortality ratio by three quarters in 2015 and achieving universal access to reproductive health.10 Unfortunately, and despite tremendous work by dedicated advocates, MDG 5 remains the MDG furthest from achieving its goal, as compared to the achievements of other MDGs.11 According to the World Bank, \"the average maternal mortality ratio, which measures the risk of dying once a woman becomes pregnant, declined at less than [one] percent per year between 1990 and 2005.\"12 This is far below the target reduction of seventy-five percent by 2015. In some cases, the situation has worsened. In southern Africa, for example, the maternal mortality ratio increased from 171 in 1990 to 381 in 2008.13 To achieve a seventy- five percent reduction, the rate would have to decline by roughly five and one half percent annum.14 While the reduction is not perfectly on track, there have been major improvements and effective interventions in some regions or communities that have created dramatic results in specific cases. For example, India has experienced a four percent annual drop in the mortality ratio, despite its high numbers of maternal deaths.15 Egypt, between 1990 and 2008, experienced an annual decline of 8.4%.16 However, these successes merely serve to underscore the essential point: maternal mortality is preventable, even in developing nations. As international bodies reaffirm their commitments to achieving MDG 5, advocates are calling for an increased role for human rights frameworks and legal strategies in the achievement of the goal. At a minimum, the human rights law that prohibits discrimination in health services on the basis of sex can: serve to articulate norms regarding access to health services, underscore the obligation to provide reproductive health care to women, provide frameworks for ensuring that health and development projects reach all women in a nation, and provide accountability mechanisms for violations. The first step is to establish that women and adolescent girls have rights to reproductive and sexual health. Next we must identify tools and mechanisms to enforce those rights, changing the legal, social and political contexts in which women live their reproductive and sexual lives. These processes are, of course, dialectical, and advocates have learned a great deal in the past thirty years about best practices in both medicine and law. Four of the major international human rights treaties, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the Convention of the Rights of the Child (CRC) are the most frequently cited in the prevention of maternal mortality. Additionally, other treaties, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment (CAT), have been interpreted to also influence maternal mortality. UN treaty bodies monitor compliance by States Parties to these international treaties.17 Each treaty body has issued \"general comments\" or \"general recommendations\" interpreting treaty provisions.18 Signatory nations must submit country reports to each treaty body reporting on their efforts to respect, protect, and fulfill their obligations under the specific treaty.19 The treaty body then issues \"concluding observations\" for each reporting government, often commenting on issues such as observable progress towards, or retrenchment, from fulfilling a particular mandate.20 Some treaty bodies may also examine individual complaints and issue written decisions.21 These decisions, while not precedential the way judicial decisions in a common law system might be, further serve to interpret the treaty language and clarify the obligations of all States Parties.22 Advocates have also drawn upon, and pursued cases under, regional treaties, such as the American Convention on Human Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights. The newest of the 19 Winter 2013regional treaties, the Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa, contains the most specific mandates regarding women' s health of any international instrument.23 III. MATERNAL MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY The World Health Organization (WHO) defines maternal mortality as \"the death of a woman while pregnant or within [forty-two] days of termination of pregnancy ... from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes.\"24 Researchers often use the \"ratio\" of maternal mortality (maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) as an indicator of the outcomes of maternal health services.25 This ratio includes rates of death caused by complications from abortion, as well as labor, delivery or post-partum complications.26 Although preventable maternal death, and women' s health more generally, is a complex matter that implicates many political, familial, legal and social structures, the next section of this background paper will focus on the human rights implications of three of the major causes of maternal mortality: (1) lack of access to pregnancy-related health services, including skilled attendants at birth and \"Emergency Obstetric Care\"; (2) unmet need for family planning services and contraception, either due to legal restrictions or lack of available services; and (3) complications from self-induced or poorly performed abortions when safe and/or legal abortions are not available, either due to legal restrictions or lack of available services. The final section of this paper will also introduce briefly the role that access to information and education can play in the reduction of maternal mortality. The authors intend for this section paper to be to be an introductory overview, rather than an exhaustive review. A. Health Services, including Skilled Attendants at Birth and Emergency Obstetric Care The majority of maternal deaths occur during and immediately after delivery. Although a wide range of services can improve outcomes, two are imperative in reducing mortality: skilled birth attendants and Emergency Obstetric Care (EmOC). The presence of skilled attendants at birth is one the most effective methods of preventing maternal mortality, and has the additional benefit of reducing rates of infant death.27 A \"skilled attendant\" refers to a person with midwifery skills who can manage normal labor and deliver, recognize the onset of complications, perform essential interventions and supervise referral if the mother or baby requires interventions that are beyond their expertise or are not possible in the particular setting.28 A skilled attendant can manage the vast majority of complications that arise during an otherwise normal labor and delivery, and can arrange for the referral and transportation of women to facilities that can handle more complex matters, should they arise.29 The presence of skilled attendants is one of the characteristics of countries that have reduced mortality ratios below one hundred.30 Emergency obstetric care encompasses all of the components of basic obstetric care including: medical treatment of complications, manual procedures (such as repair of tears or removal of placenta) and monitoring of labor, as well as surgical interventions (including cesarean sections when warranted) anesthesia, and blood replacement.31 Noted expert Lynn Freeman writes, \"if the human right in question is the right not to die of an avoidable death in pregnancy and childbirth, then the first line of appropriate measures that will move progressively toward the realization of the right is the implementation of EmOC. In a human rights analysis EmOC is not just one good idea among many. It is an obligation.\"32 The right to health, enshrined in various instruments,33 is a useful tool in increasing access to vital services. The ICESCR, Article 12, articulates the right of all people to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. It is important to note that, although health care services are an important component of the right to health, this right is not limited to health services alone and encompasses \"both freedoms and entitlements.\"34 In addition to rights such as a healthy environment, the right to health includes access to health-related information and education, including sexual and reproductive health.35 The ESCR Committee notes that \"[a]ppropriate medical benefits should be provided for women and children, including peri-natal, childbirth and postnatal care.\"36 It also adds that, \"public 20 Health Law & Policy Briefhealth infrastructures should provide for sexual and reproductive health services, including safe motherhood, particularly in rural areas.\"37 The ESCR Committee, which places a high priority on reproductive and maternal health care, has confirmed that reproductive and maternal health care services are obligations , comparable to core obligations, to be addressed immediately rather than progressively.38 It has clarified that the treaty obliges States Parties to ensure that health facilities, goods and services are affordable to women and adolescent girls and available to all of the women of a nation, regardless of where they reside within the country (urban vs. rural) or other social disadvantages.39 The ESCR has clarified that it is insufficient to distinguish general declines in maternal mortality, or adequate levels of care for many, if particular groups of women are still suffering from high rates of preventable death due to lack of access to health services. The Convention of Elimination of All forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) \"protects the right to non-discriminatory access to health care services, rather than the right to health as such.\"40 Article 12(2) explicitly requires States Parties to \"ensure to women appropriate services in connection with pregnancy, confinement and the post-natal period, granting free services where necessary.\"41 For example, the Committee has interpreted this mandate to require Emergency Obstetrical Care, \"to the maximum extent of available resources.\"42 The Committee has also repeatedly addressed skilled birth attendants, and primary health services that could encourage safer pregnancy.43 Because maternal mortality is a largely preventable cause of death, the committee considers the States Parties' obligation to provide services required to reduce the rate immediate .44 In 2011, the CEDAW Committee became the first U.N. body to issue a decision in an individual complaint regarding maternal mortality, in the groundbreaking case of Alyne da Silva Pimentel Tiexeira v. Brazil .45 Ms. da Silva Pimentel Tiexeira, a Brazilian of African descent, died due to complications from fetal death during her sixth month of pregnancy.46 Despite the fact that she was admitted to a health facility and treated, the CEDAW Committee found that Ms. da Silva Pimentel Tiexeira died as the direct result of inappropriate emergency obstetric care.47 During her ordeal, Ms. da Silva Pimentel Tiexeira waited for over eight hours, two of which she was in a coma, for transportation to a hospital with superior facilities.48 She was finally transferred, but without medical records, and placed in a hallway due to lack of space.49 After 21 hours in the hospital hallway, in which the Committee found that she was largely unattended, she died of digestive hemorrhage from the delivery of the stillborn fetus.50 The Committee found Brazil accountable for her death, despite Brazil' s arguments that the inappropriateness of the service was imputable to a private health care institution.51 The decision established that Brazil had neglected its due diligence obligation to ensure appropriate services in connection with the pregnancy, failed to meet the specific, distinctive health needs of women, failed in its duty to regulate and monitor private health care institutions, failed to address the multiple forms of de facto discrimination against women of African descent and low socio-economic status, and failed to ensure effective judicial protection for the family.52 Regional mechanisms may also provide the basis for entitlements to pregnancy-related health services. For example, the Protocol of San Salvador, which addresses economic, social and cultural rights for signatory states in the Western Hemisphere, establishes a right to health, and mandates that states guarantee this right without discrimination.53 It should be noted that the Protocol of San Salvador contains a clause granting limited jurisdiction to the organs of the inter-American system, enabling them to examine individual petitions concerning the rights protected in Articles 8(a) and 13 (i.e. the right to organize and join trade unions and the right to education).54 Therefore, the Commission does not have subject matter jurisdiction to examine alleged violations relating to the right to health under the protocol of San Salvador. However, the Commission has competence to analyze the right to health according to Article 26 of the American Convention on Human Rights and take into account other relevant regional instruments. The Inter American Commission has noted that the right to health is linked with the right to life and personal integrity.55 In addition, the Commission 21 Winter 2013has indicated that states' obligation to guarantee the integrity of its citizens by providing medical treatment constitutes an immediate obligation to the States Parties.56 Numerous cases have been brought before the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights (IACHR) that have touched upon access to sexual and reproductive health services, including Mar\u00eda Mam\u00e9rita Mestanza v. Peru, 57 Paulina Ramirez Jacinto v. Mexico ,58 and I.V . v. Bolivia.59 The allegations in the three cases, which were largely focused on other violations of women' s rights such as forced sterilization and prevention of legal abortion, also addressed the failure to provide appropriate health care to the women involved. B. Contraception and Family Planning Contraceptives prevent maternal mortality in three primary ways. First, they decrease the total number of pregnancies, each one of which puts women at risk.60 Second, they prevent unwanted pregnancies, thus reducing reliance on unsafe abortion.61 Finally, they reduce high-risk births due to maternal age, other risk factors, and timing between births.62 The global need for modern contraceptives is enormous and unsatisfied. According to the UNFPA, roughly 215 million women in developing nations, who seek to avoid or delay pregnancy, do not have access to modern contraceptive methods; instead they are forced to rely upon unreliable traditional methods or no contraceptive method.63 Globally, states with an unsatisfied need for contraceptives for their populations account for 82% of all unintended pregnancies.64 Satisfying this need could significantly reduce maternal mortality and morbidity as well as reduce the rates of unsafe abortions. Women undergo forty-five million abortions per year; a significant percentage of those abortions are unsafe, resulting in the deaths of 47,000 women per year, and injury to many others.65 Simply addressing the unmet need for contraception would reduce abortions-many of which are unsafe- by twenty-five million less per year. Unsatisfied need of contraception stems from two sources: (1) legal bans or requirements that make contraception overly difficult to obtain; and (2) lack of access to contraception and family planning services due to affordability, stigma, or other social barriers, including discrimination, lack of information, inability to access health services more generally, or lack of sexual education. Women in situations of vulnerability, especially those with disabilities, racial minorities and indigenous women, refugees, women in conflict zones and women experiencing domestic violence, also have difficulty obtaining appropriate modern contraception.66 Adolescent girls in particular face significant barriers to modern contraception, although they are the most likely benefit from delaying childbearing.67 Stigma, parental consent laws, lack of information, and cost all contribute to high rates of teen pregnancy, abortion and early childbearing.68 The cost of contraception is a barrier for millions of women worldwide. Despite the immense benefits of contraception for women and communities, funding for family planning services has been reduced in recent years, and is the subject of ongoing controversy in many regions of the world.69 The Programme of Action from the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo marked a dramatic shift in the stigma on contraceptives by recognizing reproductive rights as fundamental human rights. It identified contraceptive information and services as essential to ensuring reproductive health and rights.70 It affirmed that \"the aim of family-planning programmes must be to enable couples and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children and to have the information and means to do so and to ensure informed choices and make available a full range of safe and effective methods.\"71 In addition to the aforementioned access to health services mandated by Article 12(2), CEDAW was the first international treaty to specifically mandate access to family planning services. Article 12(1) of CEDAW requires that States Parties \"ensure, on a basis of equality of men and women, access to health care services, including those related to family planning.\"72 The Committee recommends prioritization of the \"prevention of unwanted pregnancy through family planning and sex education,\" and has repeatedly taken 22 Health Law & Policy Briefup the question of affordable family planning services in concluding observations. 73 Article 16 of CEDAW also requires States Parties ensure that women can control the number and spacing of their children equally with men. CEDAW is the only UN treaty to specifically address family planning as a women' s right . While other international human rights bodies consider contraception and family planning as a subset of reproductive and sexual health services, or frame maternal health as a matter of concern, CEDAW specifically frames the issue as one of women' s rights to plan and control their own reproductive lives outside of the health context. To comply with CEDAW , access to family planning services must remain rooted in women' s reproductive decision making. The CEDAW Committee has mandated that contraception and family planning must occur with the full and informed consent of the women and girls involved.74 States that denied women, mostly those from disadvantaged social minority groups or with disabilities, the opportunity to bear children through programs of forced sterilization without their consent violate the norms set forth in CEDAW . Other U.N. treaties have addressed access and affordability, including the CESCR. For example, the WHO includes several methods of contraception on its list of \"essential medicines.\"75 The ESCR Committee has decided that the ESCR' s promise of the right to health requires, at minimum, the provision of essential drugs on the WHO list.76 The Committee on the Rights of the Child has also urged States Parties to \"develop and implement programmes that provide access to sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, contraception.\"77 Regional bodies have also encouraged access to contraception. For example, Article 14 of the Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa specifies that the right to health of women includes \"(a) the right to control their fertility; (b) the right to decide whether to have children, the number of children, and the spacing of children; (c) the right to choose any method of contraception; ... [and] (f) the right to have family planning education.\"78 Some states or localities have laws specifically banning either all modern contraceptive methods, or merely specific methods. For example, the city of Manila in the Philippines has imposed a total ban on the distribution of modern contraception in public health centers.79 The Supreme Court of Honduras recently upheld a ban on Emergency Contraception, joining several other nations that ban the use of this specific method.80 As previously discussed, numerous human rights bodies have confirmed that states have an obligation to eliminate legal barriers to contraceptives and family planning services. For example, in some nations where access to legal contraception is limited or specific forms of contraception are banned, legal systems may reflect religious views regarding the use of contraception that stem from a single tradition. According to the Human Rights Committee, such laws violate multiple provisions of the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights including freedom of thought, conscience and religion, in addition to interfering with the rights to health and related rights described in this paper.81 Other treaty bodies have noted that the right to privacy guaranteed by various treaties such as the ICCPR, the CRC, and the American Convention on Human Rights, protects the rights of women to make fundamental decisions about private and family lives without government interference.82 The right to determine the number and spacing of children forms a central pillar of CEDAW' s prohibition on discrimination against women.83 State bans on contraception or specific forms of contraception contravene the rights outlined in CEDAW Article 16, as they reduce, if not eliminate, the means to effectuate it.84 The CEDAW Committee has also addressed other legal barriers to contraception, including third party authorization requirements. State-sanctioned policies allowing spouses, parents or others to limit access to contraceptives, or limitations on contraception contingent on factors such as marital status or gender, rely on stereotypes of women as incapable of making decisions regarding their own health, and constitute impermissible discrimination under CEDAW .85 C. Safe and Legal Abortion Unsafe abortions are those performed by untrained personnel, and/or those executed in unhygienic 23 Winter 2013settings. The WHO estimates that women around the world undergo 19.7 million unsafe abortions each year, 19.2 of which occur in developing countries.86 Complications from abortion account for approximately 13% of maternal deaths; 66,5000 women die each year from unsafe abortion.87 While the number of women dying due to unsafe abortions per year is down from the 69,000 reported in 1990, the figures remain too high for an almost entirely preventable cause of death. Almost all unsafe abortions occur in developing countries.88 Despite its potential to reduce maternal mortality, safe and legal abortion remains controversial internationally. Although there has been a general trend towards liberalization of abortion laws in many nations, women around the world continue to face barriers to safe and legal abortions in many circumstances.89 Barriers to safe abortion care may be divided into strictly legal bans-full criminalization without exception for women and providers-and/or burdensome legal requirements and lack of access due to cost, stigma or discrimination. Advocates have pursued rights-based approaches to abortion in a variety of national and international settings, although explicit opposition from some religious entities and states has been strong. Among the international human rights treaties, the Protocol on the Rights of Women in Africa is the only binding instrument that explicitly requires States Parties to \"protect the reproductive rights of women by authorizing medical abortion in cases of sexual assault, rape, incest, and where the continued pregnancy endangers the mental and physical health of the mother or the life of the mother or the fetus.\"90 Because this treaty, as well as the rights of women to abortion care, is new to international law, advocates should pay particular attention to how the treaty body enforces the rights of women in member states. Despite the lack of explicit mention of abortion per se, some international and regional human rights advocates may reinforce women' s rights to access safe and legal abortion. Because of high rates of maternal death caused by unsafe illegal abortions, human rights treaty bodies invoke the right to life, to not be subject to degrading treatment, and to privacy, which implies the possibility to make decisions free from coercion, discrimination and violence, in connection with safe and legal abortion.91 For example, General Comment No. 28 to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) asserts that States Parties should report adopted measures to prevent unwanted pregnancies and ensure that women are not forced to undergo clandestine abortions.92 The CEDAW Committee has expressed concern regarding the criminalization of abortion, noting that \"barriers to women' s access to appropriate health care include laws that criminalize medical procedures only needed by women and that punish women who undergo those procedures.\"93 It also recommends that, \"when possible, legislation criminalizing abortion could be amended, in order to remove punitive measures imposed on women who undergo abortion.\"94 It has repeatedly addressed the issue in Concluding Observations, encouraging states to ensure access to abortion in accordance with domestic legislation, and requesting that states remove penalties for women undergoing abortion.95 The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) addresses the adolescent girls' right to life and survival.96 The Committee of the CRC has expressed its concern over the differential impact of criminalization of abortion on adolescents, as well as their general lower levels of access to abortion services due to their age and lack of resources.97 A small number of nations criminalize abortion in all circumstances. Total criminalization of abortion draws condemnation from a number of treaty bodies. For example, after Nicaragua criminalized abortion in all circumstances, including when the woman' s life is at risk and when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, the Committee on the Rights of the Child, the Committee against Torture, the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the CEDAW Committee all addressed the ban.98 The CRC, for example, noted that the ban undermined efforts to prevent child abuse, and that maternal mortality among adolescents had increased since the imposition of criminalization.99 Similarly, with regard to El Salvador, the HRC expressed concern in 2010 that, [t]he Current Criminal Code criminalizes all forms of abortion, given that illegal abortions have serious detrimental 24 Health Law & Policy Briefconsequences for women' s lives, health and well being. The Committee remains concerned that women seeking treatment in public hospitals have been reported to the judicial authorities by medical staff who believe that they have been involved in abortions, that legal proceedings have been brought against some of these women, and that in some cases these proceedings have resulted in severe penalties for the offense of abortion, or even homicide, an offense interpreted broadly by the courts.100 A number of states that are signatories to human rights treaties limit abortion to circumstances posing a danger to the health or life of the mother. Advocates maintain that criminalizing most abortions has a chilling effect on women who require abortions for therapeutic purposes because medical personnel are afraid to perform abortions despite the exception. Human rights bodies have specifically considered whether nations, which so limit abortion, are imposing a de facto total ban by failing to have in place procedures for invoking the limited right to abortion. One such case, KL v. Peru, reached the Human Rights Committee, under the optional Protocol of the ICCPR.101 In that case, medical personnel denied an abortion to a 17 year- old woman, despite the fact that the fetus she carried was anencephalic and had no chance of long-term survival.102 The pregnancy posed both physical and mental risks to the young woman103, who was forced to carry the pregnancy to term and then nurse the baby for several days before it died.104 Although abortion was generally illegal in Peru, the ban did contain an exception for therapeutic abortion in the case of risk to the mother' s health.105 The HRC found that the state violated woman' s rights because state agents denied her an abortion that should have been considered legal under Peru' s own laws.106 In another recent case,107 a young Argentinean woman, LMR, with a permanent mental disability became pregnant as a result of rape and sought an abortion at a public hospital. The hospital' s bioethics committee approved the abortion because her case fit within the exemption to the Argentinean Criminal Code for pregnancies resulting in the rape of a woman with a mental impairment.108 However, before the procedure could be performed, judicial proceedings were initiated to prevent the abortion and the hospital was issued an injunction.109 Although LMR was ultimately successful in her appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice, the hospital did not perform the abortion, due to pressure from anti-abortion groups, on the grounds that the pregnancy was too advanced at its current stage of twenty to twenty-two weeks.110 The Human Rights Committee concluded that Argentina, by failing to guarantee LMR' s right to a legal abortion as provided for under the Criminal Code, had violated her rights.111 The HRC deemed the physical and mental suffering LMR was forced to endure was further aggravated by her status as a woman with a disability, and confirmed that the treatment covered by Article 7 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) extends to acts that cause mental suffering. Additionally, the HRC concluded that LMR' s right to privacy was violated by Argentina,112 due to unlawful judicial interference in a matter that should have been between LMR, her legal guardian and her physicians. The HRC concluded that Argentina was in breach of Articles 7 and 17 of the ICCPR, and in breach of Article 2 of the Optional Protocol in relation to ICCPR Articles 3, 7 and 17.113 The European Court of Human Rights has similarly found that if a state \"adopts statutory regulations allowing abortion in some situations, it must not structure its legal frameworks in a way that would limit real possibilities to obtain it.\"114 In the cases of Tysiac v. Poland and RR v. Poland , the court noted a positive obligation on the part of states to \"create a procedural framework enabling a pregnant woman to exercise her right of success to lawful abortion.\"115 In the case of AB & C v. Ireland , for example, the same court found that the failure to provide \"C\" with a meaningful procedure to obtain an abortion within Ireland when her life was in danger resulted in \"a striking discordance between the theoretical right to a lawful abortion in Ireland on the grounds of a relevant risk to the woman' s life and the reality of its practical implementation.\"116 D. Access to Information and Sexual Education Information and education play a crucial role in the efforts to reduce maternal mortality in adolescent 25 Winter 2013girls and women. Additionally, the lack of education, access to information and benefit of scientific progress deepen the vulnerability of adolescent girls and women to discrimination.117 The right to education encompasses an individual woman' s right to accurate information regarding contraception, family planning and abortion. Human rights instruments recognize that education has direct implications on the rights to life, health, education and non-discrimination.118 CEDAW , for example, conditions that States Parties must provide \"access to information, education, and means that enable women to decide on the number and spacing of their children.\"119 In relation to adolescent girls, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has indicated in its General Comment 4, that States Parties should provide adolescents with access to sexual and reproductive information, including on family planning and contraceptives, the dangers of early pregnancy, the prevention of HIV/AIDS and the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In addition, States parties should ensure that they have access to appropriate information, regardless of their marital status and whether their parents or guardians consent. It is essential to find proper means and methods of providing information that is adequate and sensitive to the particularities and specific rights of adolescent girls and boys.120 The ICESCR also recognizes the right to access information and benefits from the advancment of scientific progress.121 The right to information also encompasses knowledge regarding public health expenditures and disaggregated data regarding maternal mortality, health care services, contraception and abortion. Understanding how the risks of maternal death are distributed within a nation, and understanding how a state is, or is not, allocating resources to prevent maternal mortality can be a powerful tool for demanding reform.1221 See Rebecca Cook et al., adv ancing safe mOtHeRHOOd tHROugH Human RigHts 5 (WHO) (2001) http://www.who. int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perinatal_ health/RHR_01_5/en/index.html (stating that women' s health issues are often avoidable and this equates to a denial of human rights and an injustice against women). 2 Ban Ki-moon, glObal stRategy fOR WOmen 's and cHildRen 's HealtH 4 (2010) (citing UN inter-agency estimates based on 2010 data). 3 Pan American Health Organization, PaHO R egiOnal stRategy fOR mateRnal mORtality and mORbidity ReductiOn 26 (2002) available at http://www.paho.org/ English/AD/FCH/WM/maternalmortalitystrategy.pdf [hereinafter PAHO, Regional Strategy ]. 4 Id. at 25. 5 World Bank, unfinisHed business : m Obilizing neW effOR ts tO acHieve tHe 2015 m illennium develOPment gOals 8 (2010), available at http://www.worldbank.org/ mdgs/MDGPaperFINALSeptember102010.pdf [hereinafter Unfinished Business ]. 6 Id. at 10. 7 PAHO Regional Strategy, supra note 3, at 26. 8 Unfpa , fact sHeet: adOlescent giRls' sexual webdav/site/global/shared/documents/Reproductive%20 Health/Fact%20Sheets/Adolescent%20Girls%20SRHealth_ UNFPA%20Fact%20Sheet_July%205%202012.pdf. 9 PAHO Regional Strategy, supra note 3, at 26. 10 OHCHR, RePOR t Of tHe un HcHR On PReventable mateRnal mOR tality and mORbidity and Human RigHts 4 (OHCHR) (2010), available at http://www2.ohchr.org/ english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/14session/A.HRC.14.39_ AEV -2.pdf. 11 Id. 12 Unfinished Business , supra 5, at 10. 13 Id. at 8. 14 Margaret C.

These recommendations have been suggested by the Women and Adolescent Girls: Maternal Mortality & Morbidity that convened on March 21 and 22, 2012 at the Inaugural Conference on Global Health, Gender and Human Rights, which was organized by the American University Washington College of Law and PAHO/WHO. These recommendations do not necessarily reflect the views of the author(s) of the preceding article. The recommendations are divided by the following set of questions based on principles extracted from the PAHO Resolution \"Health and Human Rights\" (CD 50 R.8), which was approved by the 50th Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). This resolution urges health authorities to use human rights treaties and standards to reform health systems, collaborate with the judiciary, legislators and civil society and train health workers on human rights obligations. All PAHO Member States recognized in the concept paper, Health and Human Rights (Document CD50/12) and in resolution CD50R8 that \"[h] uman rights law, as enshrined in international and regional human rights conventions and standards, offers a unifying conceptual and legal framework for these strategies, as well as measures by which to evaluate success and clarify the accountability and responsibilities of the different stakeholders involved.\" TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE NATIONAL CONTEXT, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS OF COUNTRIES: a. Which areas require special attention from government agencies? Reinforce education in general from elementary school, focusing on rural areas and in particular regarding reproductive and sexual health; Invest and allocate budget to insure access to contraception; Strengthen the technical capacity of the health authority to provide support for the formulation of health policies and plans consistent with the applicable international human rights instruments related to health; Promote training programs for health workers on the applicable international human rights instruments; and Establish mechanisms to protect private patients' information and provide access to their own information (medical files, etc.). b. What key factors should be identified and included by health authorities and other governmental actors when formulating national health policies and plans consistent with the applicable international human rights instruments that protect women and adolescents girls' rights to physical and mental health and other related human rights? Develop and enforce protocols for the implementation of right to health and other rights of women and girls; Uphold the fundamental right of women to control their bodies and controlling the timing and spacing of their children; Policies that empower women to par ticipate in the design, implementation and monitoring of health policies and plans; Mechanisms for meaningful account- ability of duty bearers (government, health services, etc); Meaningful participation and involve ment of civil society; and Link academia with the health systems for capacity building, not just health workers, but also legal professionals, including judges, attorneys and law students. c. Which key provisions should be included by legislators when reviewing and reform- ing national health legislation and incor - porating the international human rights instruments, especially those protecting women and adolescent girls? For example, consider anti-abortion legislation and access to contraception, including emergency contraception. Decriminalize abortion and remove from penal code when applicable; Access to contraception and sexual and reproductive services; Access to post-abortion care; Establish clear rules about confidentiality, informed consent and information sharing; and Access to comprehensive sex education. d. What measures should governments take to ensure the effective implementation of national health policies, plans and laws that protect women and adolescent girls? Increase knowledge about the human rights conventions related to women and girls in the context of reproductive and sexual health; Develop educative materials where international human rights instruments are and translate them into simple language to be more accessible to the health providers; Develop indicators to increase ability to quantify specific factors and identify violations of women and girls' rights, including key human rights indicators; Establish training programs to technical areas, especially those most closely involved in protecting the health of women and girls, gradually incorporating the international human rights instruments related to health into their programs; Revise/modify existing curricula in universities to include rights of women and girls in the context of health; Make user friendly and efficient modules available in human rights instruments protecting human rights of women and girls. e. Parliaments and domestic courts play a key role in promoting and protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and adolescent girls. What concrete functions and contributions can those institutions make? Formulate and, if possible, adopt legislative, administrative, educational, and other measures to disseminate the applicable international human rights instruments on protecting the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and other related human rights among the appropriate personnel in the legislative and judicial branches and other governmental authorities, with a particular emphasis on human rights law obligations in the context of access to family planning, therapeutic abortion, emergency contraception and access to information on sexual health among indigenous and afro-descendant women and adolescent girls; Adopt protocols for implementation; and Use the bar associations to train law students and medical association to train medical students. f. What measures could be taken by all those members of society at large who are involved in protecting the human rights of women and adolescent girls? Promote, as appropriate, the dissemination of information and knowledge among civil society organizations and other social actors on the applicable international human rights instruments related to health, to address 30 Health Law & Policy Briefstigmatization, discrimination, and exclusion of women and adolescent girls; Promote Role models-people that stand up in the community-to fight for human rights; Involve in the design and monitoring of the Budget to include a gender perspective; Involve media to play a role in promoting women and girls' rights; Network of healthcare associations- platform coordination; and Increase and advocate for the role of men in family planning. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, CIVIL SOCIETY AND ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS ON THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF THE RIGHT TO HEALTH AND OTHER RELATED HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE CONTEXT OF WOMEN AND ADOLESCENT GIRLS: a. What measures could be taken by PAHO and technical teams of Washington College of Law and other universities to strengthen technical cooperation with the human rights committees, organs and rapporteurships of the United Nations and Inter-American systems (such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights) in order to promote and protect the right to health and other related human rights of women and adolescent girls? Formulate technical opinions on health; Participate in thematic hearings; File supportive amicus briefs on human rights and right to health of women and girls; Visit health centers and other institutions in countries to reduce maternal mortality; Make data accessible to non-health experts; and Support strategies and provide technical support to adopt and amend legislation to promote and protect human rights of women and girls. b. How could PAHO and other international agencies promote and stimulate collaboration and research with academic institutions, the private sector, civil society organizations and other social actors, when appropriate, to promote and protect human rights in keeping with the international human rights instruments that protect women and adolescent girls? Coordinate joint initiatives in order to set up a network for global, regional and national action; Develop masters programs and generate knowledge to influence the policy makers; Develop opportunities for student involvement with national and international organizations; and Conduct studies on laws and policies that have been effective. c. How could PAHO and other international agencies, governments and academic institutions and civil society promote the sharing of good practices and successful experiences among countries so as to prevent maternal mortality, stigmatization, discrimination and exclusion of women and adolescent girls? Use value added measurements to communicate effectiveness of reforms; Utilize online tools and discussions; Apply tools/publications regarding and Target high-profile events.31 2013sTaTE OBliga TiOns TO guaRanTEE ThE human R ighT TO hEal Th anD ThE DER ivaTivE R ighT TO accEss Natassia Rozario Mina Trudeau* INTRODUCTION More than 1.2 billion people throughout the world are living in poverty.1 Of them, seven out of every ten are women and girls.2 1.2 billion people in the world also lack access to basic sanitation.3 More than half a million women die each year from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth.4 Ninety-nine percent of those deaths are in developing countries.5 Two-thirds of all people living with HIV are in sub-Saharan Africa.6 Most of them are women.7 Expansion of health services worldwide has not been accompanied by quality, and international aid to the poorest countries in the world falls far short of the 2010 target set by the international community.8 In this current global context of complex and pressing health needs that are augmented by lack of economic access and other structural inequalities, the duties of States, individually and as part of the international community, as well as the responsibilities of non-state actors, to guarantee the right to health and ensure access to medicines for all people, including impoverished and otherwise vulnerable and marginalized communities, cannot be overemphasized. This paper reviews the human rights obligations of States, and the responsibilities of non-state actors, particularly pharmaceutical companies, to ensure the right of health and access to medicines for all people. While this paper seeks to articulate the human rights framework for the right to health, and specifically as it pertains to the derivative right of access to medicines, we note that there are pertinent issues, * Oph\u00e9lie Garnier is a member of the New Y ork Bar and 2012 graduate of American University Washington College of Law' s LL.M Program in International Legal Studies where she specialized in Intellectual Property.

This article is based on a paper that was presented at the Inaugural Conference on Global Health, Gender, and Human Rights, sponsored by the American University Washington College of Law, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Guatemala. The paper was written under the supervision of and in consultation with Sean Flynn from the American University Washington College of Law; Dr. James Fitzgerald, PAHO Senior Advisor on Essential Medicines and Biologicals; Javier Vasquez, PAHO Regional Advisor on Human Rights Law; and Cristina Leria, PAHO Consultant on Human Rights. Alejandro Morlachetti, PAHO Consultant on Human Rights, reviewed an earlier version of this paper. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the individual authors and do not necessarily represent the position of PAHO, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Guatemala, the Health Law & Policy Brief, or the American University Washington College of Law.32 Health Law & Policy Briefsuch as the intellectual property framework, that are not addressed by this paper, but are discussed and debated elsewhere. Additionally, each of the specific enumerated rights related to the right to health can be expounded upon and thus, the paper should not be considered an exhaustive treatment of all the relevant issues. Finally, although the contents of the paper, and any errors, are our own, we wish to acknowledge the encouragement and feedback offered by Professor Sean Flynn from the Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property at American University Washington College of Law, the office of Anand Grover, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, the Pan American Health Organization, and numerous other practitioners and scholars who graciously and generously shared their time and thoughts with us. As reviewed in Part II of this paper, the right to health is a fundamental human right which necessarily intersects and overlaps with other fundamental human rights,9 including inter alia the right to life, the absolute right to freedom from torture and ill- treatment, the right to physical and mental integrity, right to social security, the right to equality and non- discrimination, and so on. 10 Additionally, in order to guarantee the right to health and the derivative right of access to medicines, States must meet their duties to respect, protect, promote and fulfill these human rights.11 In Part III of the paper, the shared responsibility between States and non-state actors, specifically pharmaceutical companies, is articulated. Part III explains that while States bear the primary obligations to ensure access to medicines, non- state actors, especially pharmaceutical companies, also bear responsibilities to enhance access to medicines.12 Moreover, Part III affirms that States are obligated to regulate pharmaceutical companies, and to ensure the accessibility, availability and quality of medicines.13 Furthermore, Part III notes that guidelines must be developed and utilized to ensure that pharmaceuticals improve their social performance, and consequently contribution towards access to medicines.14 In Part IV of the paper, the responsibilities of States and non-state actors to monitor access to medicines is discussed. Part IV explains that monitoring and accountability mechanisms are necessary to ensure access to medicines.15 Part IV argues though that while monitoring is not sufficient to ensure access, mechanisms such as collection of disaggregated data, and the creation of various indicators and benchmarks, are necessary to increase accountability and allow for imposition of consequences where States or non- state actors, including pharmaceuticals, hinder or otherwise fail to ensure access to medicines.16 Part V concludes that States are obligated to guarantee the right to health, and access to medicines, for all persons subject to their jurisdiction.17 Still, States must also ensure that non-state actors, including pharmaceutical companies, act to increase access to medicines, and that all actors hindering or otherwise violating these fundamental rights are held accountable. Finally, the Appendix provides an evaluative tool which allows States to assess and monitor their progress, and identify gaps, in their implementation of legal and related mechanisms in guaranteeing the right to health and access to medicines.18 II. THE DUTIES OF STATES TO GUARANTEE ACCESS TO MEDICINES A. States' obligations to guarantee access to medicines derive from several fundamental human rights, most evidently from the right to health and several related rights. The Right to Health 1. All States are obligated to respect, protect, promote, and fulfill19 the fundamental human right to health.20 The fundamental human right to health is set forth in numerous uni - versal and regional treaties and human rights instruments.21 2. The International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) ex - plicitly articulates the right to \"the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health\" for all people22 and sets forth the spe - cific obligations of States Parties to guarantee this right.2333 Winter 20133. States must take steps towards the \"full realization\" of the right to health,24 \"[includ - ing] those necessary for ... the prevention, treatment and control of epidemic, endemic, and occupational and other diseases.\"25 Furthermore, States must take steps to \"[create] conditions which would assure to all medical service and medical attention in the event of sickness,\"26 which necessarily includes access to medicines.27 Thus, States are obligated to ensure access to medicines as an integral component and derivative right28 of the full guarantee of the right to health. 4. The right to health is broadly inclusive of \"a wide range of socio-economic factors\" and applies to all social determinants of health.29 These determinants of health include all \"sys - tems put in place to deal with illness.\"30 Thus, States must ensure that health care systems and infrastructure within their jurisdictions function to guarantee the right to health, in - cluding access to medicines, for all people. Health care systems and infrastructure, and State laws and policies, that hinder or other - wise restrict access to medicines undermine a necessary determinant of health and thereby violate the guarantee of the right to health.31 5. Furthermore, even States not party to the ICESCR are obligated to guarantee the right to health and the derivative right of access to medicines as codified in universal32 and regional human rights instruments.33 6. The right to health is explicitly articulated through normative frameworks in each of the three regional human rights systems. In the Americas, States must guarantee every per - son' s right to preserve their health (including through medical care),34 in order that they may enjoy the highest level of well-being.35 States must provide primary health care, and related services and education, to all people in their jurisdiction, including high-risk and vulnerable individuals.36 States' duties in - clude the provision of \"[u]niversal immuniza - tion against principal infectious diseases\" and the \"[p]revention and treatment of endemic, occupational and other diseases.\"37 Similarly, in the African region, States must guarantee every person' s \"right to enjoy the best attain - able state of physical and mental health.\"38 States must take all \"necessary measures to protect the health of their people and to en - sure that they receive medical attention .\"39 And, in Europe, States must \"take appropri - ate measures ... to remove ... the causes of ill-health... to prevent as far as possible epi - demic, endemic, and other diseases,\"40 and to provide relevant education and otherwise promote health.41 The Right to Life 7. As the right to life is predicated on health, the right to health has been inferred from the right to life as articulated in universal and re - gional human rights instruments. The funda - mental articulation of the right to life and the right to health is articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.42 The funda - mental human right to life is reaffirmed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.43 The right to life is similarly pro - tected in the Americas and Europe.44 In the African region, the right to life is protected in conjunction with the protection of every person' s integrity.45 The Rights to Integrity and Humane Treatment 8. Beyond protection of the right to life, States are also obligated to ensure every person' s right to physical and mental integrity,46 in addition to freedom from torture and ill- treatment.47 Furthermore, the prohibition against torture is an absolute, non-derogable, jus cogens norm48 and, as such, all States are obligated to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish all incidents of torture.49 9. Where a person may be subject to a viola - tion of their physical or mental integrity, or subject to an act of torture or ill-treatment, a person' s right to health, and their derivative right of access to medicines, is implicated and States are obligated to ensure their ac - cess to all relevant health care services and medicines.5034 Health Law & Policy BriefThe Rights to Equality and Non-Discrimination 10. States are obligated to guarantee equal treat - ment of all persons under the law51 and to prevent and prohibit discrimination against individuals or communities.52 Such prohibi - tion against discrimination includes those who may otherwise face discrimination or stigmatization in accessing their right to health and access to medicines based upon their health status.53 11. Thus, to guarantee the right to health and the derivative right of access to medicines, States must ensure that all persons54 subject to their jurisdiction inter alia have equal right of access to health care services, and do not experience de jure or de facto discrimination55 inter alia in accessing health care services or medicines.56 The Right to Social Security 12. States must ensure the social security of per - sons under their jurisdiction, and specifically, to assure their economic, cultural and social rights.57 Social security must, at a minimum, ensure support for individuals who due to age or disability may be physically or mentally un - able to meet their needs.58 13. As it applies to the right to health, the right to social security requires States \"to guar - antee that health systems are established to provide adequate access to health services for all.\"59 Thus, the right to social security \"encompasses the right to access ... without discrimination in order to secure protection ... from ... unaffordable access to health care.\"60 Furthermore, the right to social secu - rity includes provision of adequate access to preventive and curative measures, including medicines.61 14. Coupled with State obligations to ensure equality and non-discrimination, States must therefore ensure that their social security systems guarantee equal access, inter alia , to health care services and medicines for all persons subject to their jurisdiction, specifi - cally for those persons who would otherwise be unable to meet their health care and medi - cines needs.62 The Right to a Healthy Environment 15. States are also obligated to ensure safe and healthy environments, including working and living environments, for all persons, which meet their nutritional and social needs, and promote their physical, emotional and intel - lectual development.63 Much as the right to life is predicated on the right to health, the right to health is predicated on safe and healthy working and living environments. Violations of the requisite right to a healthy environment implicates the right to health as well; such violations may involve remedies via guarantees of the right to health and ac - cess to medicines. The Right to Development, Information, and the Benefits of Scientific Progress 16. States must guarantee the right of all persons to economic, social and cultural develop - ment,64 including through the right to infor - mation,65 and the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific and technological progress.66 Thus, States are obligated to ensure that all per - sons subject to their jurisdiction, inter alia , have access to information regarding health, health care and medicines, and benefit from research and development regarding preven - tative health care, treatments, and medicines. The Right to Effective Remedy 17. States are obligated to ensure every person' s right to effective remedy.67 Where States violate, or allow private and other non-state actors to violate, or otherwise fail to take nec - essary measures to protect, a person' s right to life, integrity, humane treatment or other fundamental human right, including the right to health and the derivative right of access to medicines, States are obligated to guarantee the right to effective remedy.68 B. States must satisfy specific duties in order to meet their legal obligations of guaranteeing the 35 Winter 2013right to health and the derivative right of access to medicines. 18. States must satisfy four levels of duties to meet their obligations to ensure each human right: the duty to respect, the duty to protect, the duty to promote, and the duty to fulfill.69 These duties apply to all rights, both those that are civil and political, and those that are economic, social, and cultural.70 Additionally, States in the international community have the duty to cooperate in order to ensure the full guarantee to all human rights for all people.71 The Duty to Respect 19. The duty to respect requires that States not in - terfere in the enjoyment of persons' rights, and respect their autonomy and liberty as regards their economic, social and cultural rights.72 \"The obligation to respect economic, social and cultural rights requires States to abstain from performing, sponsoring or tolerating any practice, policy or legal measure violating the integrity of individuals or infringing upon their freedom to use those material or other resourc - es available to them in ways they find most appropriate to satisfy economic, social and cultural rights. This obligation protects citizens from arbitrary interference with the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights.\"73 This duty to respect thus also prohibits all forms of discrimination and guarantees the right to equal treatment.74 20. As it applies to access to medicines, the duty to respect requires States to refrain from measures that negatively interfere with, or otherwise limit or deny, access to medicines for individuals or communities.75 Thus, the duty to respect access to medicines includes, inter alia , refraining from any measures that \"[deny or limit] equal access to medicines for [vulnerable or] marginalized individuals or communities; [prohibit or impede] the use of traditional medicines and healing practices that are scientifically sound and medically appropriate; [interfere] with the provision of humanitarian aid that facilitates the supply of necessary medicines; [or that implement] intellectual property policies that do not take full advantage of all flexibilities in the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property that promote access to affordable medicines, including entering \"TRIPS Plus\" free trade agreements.\"76 The Duties to Protect and Promote 21. The duty to protect requires States \"to pre - vent the violation of any individual' s rights by any other individual or non-State actor.\"77 Thus, the duty to protect requires States to implement effective legislation to prevent violations and effective remedies to address violations that occur.78 22. The duty to protect is also intertwined with the duty to promote, which requires States to take positive measures to promote \"tolerance, raising awareness and [infrastructural devel - opments]\" to ensure that people can exercise their rights and freedoms.79 Correspondingly, under the duty to protect, States must take positive measures to prevent discrimination.80 23. Pursuant to the duty to protect, States must ensure, inter alia , that non-state actors, such as private corporations, do not act to hinder or obstruct the enjoyment of the right to health, including the derivative right of access to medicines.81 States must take \"[i]mmediate steps to ensure that violations\" not only by State agents, but also by non-state actors, are prevented.82 Thus, States must also guarantee access to legal remedies to address all alleged violations.83 24. As it applies to access to medicines, the duty to protect requires States, inter alia , to \"ensure that only medicines that have met scientifically appropriate standards for qual - ity, safety and efficacy are available; promote the rational use of medicines, through treat - ment guidelines based on the best available evidence; prevent unreasonably high prices for needed medicines in both the public and private sectors, through promotion of equity pricing in which the poor are not re - quired to pay a disproportionate amount of 36 Health Law & Policy Brieftheir income for access; ensure that medical practitioners and patients have ready access to reliable, complete and unbiased informa - tion on the safety and efficacy of medicines; stimulate and promote competition, intellec - tual property, consumer protection and other laws to promote access to medicines.\"84 25. Furthermore, States must ensure that existing medicines are available, accessible, acceptable, and of good quality.85 States must ensure that existing medicines are \"available in sufficient quantity.\"86 States must ensure that medicines are physically and economically accessible.87 States must ensure that available medicines meet medical ethics standards and be cultur - ally acceptable in their place of distribution.88 Lastly, States must ensure provision of good quality medicines, i.e., medicines that are not condemned by the scientific community, ex - pired, or otherwise unsafe.89 The Duty to Fulfill 26. The duty to fulfill requires States to undertake positive measures towards the full realiza - tion of the right to health and the derivative right of access to medicines.90 The duty to fulfill is specifically triggered where \"other measures have not succeeded in ensuring the full realization of these rights.\"91 Indeed, this duty \"comprises those active measures by a Government necessary to guarantee each person within its jurisdiction opportunities to have full access to all entitlements to eco - nomic, social and cultural rights that cannot be secured through exclusively personal efforts.\"92 27. This duty entails, inter alia , allocation of an appropriate percentage of public expenditures to the progressive realization of these rights, State provision of relevant infrastructure (such as health care facilities, delivery systems, and trained personnel), targeted plans of ac - tion and strategies with necessary budgetary support and appropriate timelines, establish - ment of appropriate monitoring benchmarks and evaluation mechanisms, comprehensive review and appropriate amendments of laws and policies impacting the rights, and priori - tization of targeted strategies to address the specific needs of vulnerable and marginalized individuals and communities, including those who may have specific health needs.93 28. As it applies to access to medicines, the duty to fulfill requires States, inter alia , to \"[adopt] all necessary and appropriate posi- tive measures to the maximum of its available resources to promote, provide and facilitate access to needed medicines, including: im - mediately meeting the minimum core obli - gations of ensuring availability and afford - ability to all of essential medicines as defined by the country' s essential medicines list and the WHO Action Programme on Essential Drugs; immediately creating a national medi - cine strategy monitoring systems to ensure compliance with human rights obligations; promoting meaningful participation by af - fected individuals and groups in decisions that affect access to medicines, including reg - ulatory, pricing and patent decisions; creating systems in which patent information and reg - istration status for medicines is readily and publicly accessible; expediting the regulatory review and registration of needed medicines and creating incentives for companies to register needed medicines expeditiously; in - dividually and together with other States and non-governmental entities, developing and implementing need-based research and de - velopment programmes to address currently neglected diseases and conditions.\"94 The Duty to Cooperate 29. The international duty to cooperate is a fun - damental principle of international relations enshrined in the United Nations Charter.95 While the duty to cooperate clearly delin - eates the respect for sovereignty96 and non- interference,97 it equally clearly articulates the necessity for all States in the international community to cooperate to ensure the full guarantee of fundamental human rights for all people.9837 Winter 201330. States must cooperate to realize economic, social, and cultural rights for all people.99 Under the principle of international coopera - tion, the international community has a duty to provide support, while respecting the prin - ciple of sovereignty and non-interference, to developing nations that may need such sup - port to realize economic, social and cultural rights in their respective jurisdictions.100 31. All States in the international community have a duty to promote \"universal respect for, and observance of, human rights\" and the \"[promotion of] solutions of international economic, social, health, and related prob - lems.\"101 All States have the duty \"to take joint and separate action\" to realize these rights.102 States that are able to cooperate, but fail to do so or do so inadequately violate their obligations towards the realization of those rights.103 Thus, all States in the international community, insofar as they are able, have a duty to promote, and cooperate to promote, the realization of the right to health by all States in the international community. III. THE SHARED RESPONSIBILITY OF STATES AND THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY TO ENSURE ACCESS TO MEDICINES 32. States bear the primary duty to ensure the right to health and the derivative right of access to medicines. Nevertheless, non-state actors, and specifically pharmaceutical com - panies, play a crucial role in ensuring access to medicines for all persons and bear respon - sibilities for enhancing that access.A. In the context of the right to health and access to medicines, the duty to protect puts States under the obligation to regulate pharmaceutical companies. 33. In the context of the right to health and ac - cess to medicines, States are responsible for regulating the conduct of pharmaceuti - cal companies so as to prevent violations of individuals' right to health committed in their jurisdiction. 104 While States are not responsible for the acts or omissions of phar - maceutical companies, they are responsible for taking measures aimed at ensuring that such entities refrain from violating the rights of individuals and communities.105 Indeed, states have protection-bound obligations to adopt legislation or take other measures to ensure equal access to health care and health- related services provided by third-parties.106 These include \"ensuring that privatization of the health sector does not constitute a threat to the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of health facilities, goods and services and that private providers of health services and facilities comply with the prin - ciple of non-discrimination, particularly in relation to vulnerable groups.\"107 34. While regulations of pharmaceutical compa - nies' activities are indispensable to the real - ization of the right to health, they still need to be defined.108 35. Achievements in other right-to-health related areas could be helpful in determining the content and scope of regulations that states should adopt with respect to pharmaceuti - cal companies' activities. Such a framework has been developed with regard to the right to tobacco control through the adoption of the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC). The objective of the WHO FCTC and its protocols is \"to protect present and future generations ... by providing a framework for ... control measures to be implemented by the Parties at the national, regional and interna - tional levels ....\"109 To achieve this objective, the Convention sets out guiding principles for 38 Health Law & Policy Briefstates to follow.110 These principles call for the creation and implementation of regulatory measures by governments.111 Like the WHO FCTC principles, right to health analysis should call for the creation and implementa - tion of a state-initiated third party regulatory framework regarding access to medicines. States have a duty to ensure accessibility of medicines, and should take measures to prevent pharmaceutical companies from hindering affordability of medicines. 36. States should take measures to regulate the pricing policies of the pharmaceutical indus - try. The price of medicines for the end con - sumer, which is one of the major obstacles to pharmaceuticals access, is largely determined by pharmaceutical companies.112 State action is thus appropriate to prevent excessive pric - ing policies by pharmaceutical companies. 37. States' regulations with respect to pharma - ceutical companies' pricing policies could potentially reference the concept of equity pricing. When tackling the issue of economic accessibility, General Comment 14 refers to the principle of equity.113 General Comment 14 further defines the implications of this principle by stating that \"equity demands that poorer households should not be dispro - portionately burdened with health expenses as compared to richer households\".114 The concept of equity pricing derives from this principle, and can be defined as \"policies that ensure that, from the point of view of the community and the individual, the price of a drug is fair, equitable and affordable, even for a poor population and/or the health system that serves them\".115 38. As early as the 1970s, most industrialized countries began creating mechanisms to maintain pharmaceutical costs and prevent rising prices.116 Price control is one of the oldest of these mechanisms. However, there exist many modalities and variations in the way price regulation is designed and imple - mented.117 External Reference Pricing (ERP) is an example of such modalities.11839. Regardless of the method States want to use, States must be mindful of their obligation under the duty to protect to ensure that phar - maceuticals are affordable.119 States have a duty to ensure availability of medicines and should not discourage domestic generic competition, compulsory licenses and parallel importation. 40. States should not discourage domestic generic competition. There is strong evi - dence that competition can reduce prices of medicines.120 It has been demonstrated that generic pharmaceuticals and similar competi - tion increase the availability of lower-priced medicines.121 41. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) is generally acknowledged as an international agreement capable of impeding the ability of States to fulfill their duty to provide access to medicines.122 As a result of concerns that TRIPS drastically inhibited access to medi - cines, the World Trade Organization (WTO) implemented TRIPS flexibilities such as paral - lel importation and compulsory licensing so that States could be capable of fulfilling their other international obligations regarding the duty to provide the right to health. 42. Considering the important purpose encom - passed by TRIPS flexibilities, States should not prohibit parallel importation and com - pulsory licenses. Indeed, compulsory licens - ing and parallel importation allow for the reintroduction of price competition, and thus may prevent excessively high pharmaceutical pricing within a particular market.123 While parallel importation can enable governments to acquire much needed medicines at lower prices offered on the world market,124 com - pulsory licensing used to import or locally produce generics can guarantee a more cost- effective way to get cheaper medicines.125 43. Therefore, States should not discourage com - petition in the pharmaceutical industry, com - pulsory licensing and parallel importation.39 Winter 2013States have a duty to regulate the quality of medicines 44. States have an obligation to regulate the qual - ity of medicines.126Assuring the quality of medicines has been recognized as a \"major public health challenge,\" particularly with respect to cross-border health issues and international trade.127 Quality assurance with respect to medicines is a complex issue which covers several major areas: quality control, production, distribution and inspections.128 45. States could consider existing international guidelines aimed at regulating the quality of medicines and use them as a basis to define their own regulations. \"The development of norms, standards and guidelines to promote quality assurance is an integral part of WHO' s Constitution and has been endorsed and supported through numerous World Health Assembly resolutions and more recently in those on WHO Medium-Term Strategic Plan for 2008-2013.\"129 The development of norms, standards and guidelines for the quality control and quality assurance of phar - maceuticals has been defined as an essential global task.130 Such mechanisms are intended for use by national regulatory authorities, manufacturers and other stakeholders.131 46. Regardless of what methods States choose to use, they need to make sure that there exist some regulations regarding the quality of medicines. B. Pharmaceutical companies have a shared responsibility to enhance access to medicine 47. All organs of society are responsible for securing \"effective recognition and obser - vance\" of the rights and freedoms proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which include the right to health. 132 Pharmaceutical companies, as \"organs of society,\" have an indispensable role to play in the context of access to medicines. The con - cept of shared responsibility can be found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 133 which articulates the right to health among other fundamental rights.134 In addition, General Comment 14 stipulates that although States are ultimately accountable for the right to health, \"private business [also has] responsibilities regarding the realization of the right to health.\"135 The UN Millennium Development Goals also recognize that pharmaceutical companies have a responsi - bility to improve access to medicines.136 48. Pharmaceutical companies have human rights responsibilities , in contrast to States, which have legally binding obligations under human rights law. Put in another way, while States are required to act to fulfill their duties, pharmaceutical companies cannot be legally obliged to act.137 Despite the difference be - tween responsibilities and obligations under human rights law, pharmaceutical companies still must ensure that their responsibilities are fulfilled.138 Rather, it calls for the urgent need for States to define strong enforcement mechanisms at the domestic and international levels to ensure that companies comply with their responsibilities . 49. The concept of corporate responsibility is rooted in both human rights law and ethical concerns. 139 Pharmaceutical companies have a crucial role to play in not inhibiting State' s obligation to ensure access to medicines. In order to hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable under the right to health, its responsibilities need to be defined. 50. V oluntary self-regulatory regimes of phar - maceutical companies have proven unhelpful in determining corporate responsibilities regarding the right to health. 140 Corporate self-regulation has indeed been criticized for its vague human rights commitments, limited transparency regarding industry ad - herence, and lack of independent assessment of pharmaceutical companies' compliance to such commitments.141 Corporate social responsibility frameworks have additionally been criticized for lack of practicality as they embrace rights in their discourse but do not fully promote equality in practice.14240 Health Law & Policy Brief51. Pharmaceutical companies' responsibilities need to be defined. 143 Paul Hunt' s recent article entitled \"Human Rights Guidelines for Pharmaceutical Companies in relation to Access to Medicines\" clarify and define the responsibilities of pharmaceutical compa - nies.144 The Guidelines include responsibili - ties for transparency, management, monitor - ing and accountability, as well as pricing and ethical marketing. Additionally, they stipulate against lobbying for more protection in intel - lectual property laws; applying for patents for trivial modifications of existing medicines; improper advertising, and excessive pric - ing.145 The Guidelines should be read in conjunction with Paul Hunt' s report to the General Assembly on access to medicines,146 as well as with Hunt' s report on his mission to GlaxoSmithKline (GSK).147 In addition to highlighting good practices, the latter report outlines the shortcomings of industry policies and programs, and makes recommendations to GSK, other pharmaceutical companies, other non-state actors, and to States.148 Additional cooperation is needed between States, non-state actors and third party pri - vate entities. 52. Pharmaceutical companies' responsibilities, to date, have not been properly addressed and need to be defined.149 As Paul Hunt, the former UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health stated, \"[h]ow can we expect pharmaceutical companies to respect human rights if we fail to explain what they are ex - pected to do?\"150 In this regard, conversations between States, NGOs, and private entities need to occur to define where the boundaries of corporate responsibility should lie. For the concept of corporate social responsibility to be effective and meaningful, monitoring and accountability mechanisms need to assess whether pharmaceutical companies are impinging on the States' ability to protect their citizens' right to health. 53. Monitoring and accountability instruments determine which policies and practices are the most efficient and why. Such mechanisms are currently insufficient and must be made accessible, effective, transparent and inde - pendent. 151 Presently, the reporting of initia - tives taken by pharmaceutical companies to enhance access to medicines is mostly done by pharmaceutical companies themselves, with only a few exceptions.152 Although such a practice could continue, external mecha - nisms should also be in place to monitor industry practice.153 54. As part of monitoring and accountability, it is important to note good industry practices. Some of the existing programs and initiatives of the pharmaceutical industry are examples of good practices, but need further develop - ment. These include differential pricing, patient assistance programs and donations, R&D investments, support of broader health and development goals in developing coun - tries (such as health education, and training of medical staff), cooperation with government stakeholders to ensure the integration of ac - cess to medicines into national systems, and exploration of opportunities for production in developing countries (through subsidiaries or voluntary licenses).154 55. In terms of good practices, it should also be noted that companies are increasingly willing to embrace corporate responsibility practices. This trend can be explained by several fac - tors, including the necessity for companies to protect their reputation as others are monitor - ing their activities, 155 and ranking and rating systems are putting pressure on them to report their non-financial performance.156 Socially responsible investing has increased over the past decade, 157 and companies have real - ized that improving their social performance could be used as a competitive advantage in the market.158 56. As demonstrated in the example above, out - side monitoring can be effective in compel - ling pharmaceutical companies to act with regard to their human rights responsibilities. Although some pharmaceutical companies are making some positive strides on their own, there is still a need for State organized 41 Winter 2013monitoring and accountability mechanisms to assess whether pharmaceutical companies are actually refraining from interfering with States' obligation to protect. Monitoring and accountability require benchmarking, which enhances transparency among pharmaceutical companies' practices, and motivates a change in their actions. 57. As stipulated in General Comment 14, moni - toring requires creating and assessing bench - marks.159 There has been a growing trend to not just benchmark State practice, but also to benchmark pharmaceutical companies' practices in order to assess their performance regarding access to medicines, and to provide tools for improvement. 160 In regards to the benefits that benchmarking pharmaceuti - cal companies could trigger, it is critically important to ensure that such a practice can be made successful. Five different steps have been proposed to this end: (1) \"an initial diagnosis of a company[' s] performance\"; (2) \"a defined benchmark framework\"; (3) an \"analysis of the firms selected\"; (4) \"the definition of improvement objectives by partners\"; and (5) \"application of the bench - mark[] results.\"161 C. Because ensuring access to medicines is a shared responsibility, cooperation is needed to achieve sustainable results in realizing the right to health and its derivative right to access medicines. 58. To improve access to medicines, all relevant stakeholders should express a shared com - mitment, contribute their own skills and resources, cooperate with each other despite diverging interests, and strengthen account - ability and transparency mechanisms.162 59. As well as being obligated to protect the right to health of its citizens by regulating pharma - ceutical companies, States should encourage pharmaceutical companies to play a part in expanding access to medicines.IV . MONITORING AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF STATES AND NON-STATE ACTORS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO MEDICINES 60. Under the right to health, States are primarily responsible for monitoring access to medi - cines, however non-State actors also have responsibilities in this regard.163 Monitoring is central to a State' s duty to fulfill the right to health and the progressive realization of the right to health.164 To guarantee accountabil - ity, monitoring also should be accompanied by consequences for those who fail to meet their obligations under the right to health.165 Although the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Millennium Development Project have made notable progress in devel - oping analytical frameworks to measure ac - cess to medicines, much work must be done to improve evaluative tools.166 At present, monitoring and accountability mechanisms are deficient because there is no operational definition of access to medicine,167 no frame - works monitoring medicine access in a coun - try or across countries,168 an ostensible data shortage,169 an absence of quantitative targets and commitments,170 and a limited under - standing of the linkages between medicine access and the broader human rights legal framework. 171 61. As part of their mandates to help States and others to improve health outcomes and to respect, protect, and fulfill the right to health, PAHO and the UN Special Rapporteur to the Right Health should encourage both States and non-State actors to establish and improve monitoring and accountability mechanisms with respect to access to medicines.172 At the end of the paper, we offer a human rights matrix to evaluate the right to health and the derivative right to access to medicines. This matrix does not resolve all of the challenges related to monitoring and accountability, but contextualizes medicine access within the broader human rights framework and specifically evaluates how a State is fulfill - ing its obligations and responsibilities to 42 Health Law & Policy Briefthe progressive realization of health and the derivative right to access to medicines. A. States are obligated to monitor access to medicines, cooperate at the international level in data collection, and allow and encourage the participation of non-State actors in the evaluation of access to medicines. To monitor access to medicines 62. Under the right to health, States are obligated to measure progress towards access to medi - cines for persons subject to their jurisdiction. Specifically, a State is in breach of its duty to fulfill when it fails \"to monitor the realization of the right to health at the national level.\" 173 The duty to monitor is also derived from the fact that the right to health is a progressive right. 174 As the Former Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health Paul Hunt observed, without indicators and benchmarks, \"there is no way of knowing whether ... the State is improving its health system and progres - sively realizing the right to the highest attain - able standard of health.\"175 More specifically, indicators and benchmarks play an important role in the progressive realization of the right to health and the derivative right to access to medicine because they result in better informed policies; expose the unintended consequences of law, polices, and programs; identify the relevant actors to the progressive realization of the right to health; determine whether these actors are meeting their hu - man rights obligations; forewarn of potential violations; enhance transparency; promote democratization and participation in policy decision-making; and illuminate \"neglected\" or \"silenced\" issues.176 Accordingly, a State must monitor both how it is meeting its ob - ligations to provide access to medicines to a population, and the actual status of medicine access in a population.177 Ultimately, moni - toring is an integral component of creating a system of accountability regarding access to medicines, which is essential to the human rights framework.178To cooperate at the international level 63. As part of its obligations to cooperate at the international level under the right to health, States should work together with internation - al institutions, such as the WHO, to develop standardized indicators and benchmarks to measure access to medicines and to docu - ment good practices.179 International coop - eration in this regard is also essential to the progressive realization of the right to health and the derivative right to access to medicines because it enhances pressure on States to con - form to not only monitor access to medicines within their jurisdiction, but also to improve access.180 Further, greater transparency and comparability of access to medicines data at the international level also provides the international community with a better un - derstanding of the challenges a State faces in providing medicine access to its population, and also highlights situations where a State may be in need of international assistance.181 Under Article 2(1) of the ICESR, devel - oped States are required to help developing States in fulfilling their obligations under the Covenant, which encompasses the right to health and the derivative right to access to medicines.182 To allow and encourage the participation of non- State actors 64. Under the right to health, States are required to allow for the participation of NGOs, civil society groups, community groups, and the business sector in the evaluation of indicators and benchmarks of access to medicines.183 The Declaration of Alma-Ata also stresses the import of civic society participation in health policy decision-making.184 These stakehold - ers both have responsibilities under the right to health185 and enjoy the right to \"active and informed participation on decisions bearing on their health.\"186 Meaningful accountabil - ity also \"requires processes that empower and mobilize ordinary people to become engaged in political and social action.\"187 Thus, States Parties have crucial obligations to cultivate 43 Winter 2013environments that allow groups and individu - als to enjoy their right to participate and that encourage key stakeholders to fulfill their du - ties to improve access to medicines.188 B. Non-State actors share responsibility in the monitoring of access to medicines. 65. As mentioned above, the right to health also imposes responsibilities upon civil society to monitor access to medicines.189 Their par - ticipation in monitoring is integral to holding a State and others accountable because it provides an alternative explanation of how these actors are meeting their obligations and responsibilities to provide access to medicines to a population and also on the actual status of medicine access within a population.190 66. Because of their expertise and their ability to coordinate at the global level, international organizations have an important role in the realization of health and have taken respon - sibility in coordinating data collection and establishing standardized indicators that monitor access to medicines.191 Ten years ago, the WHO developed a set of indicators to evaluate national drug policies.192 Since then, the WHO has established indicators and methods to define and measure access to es - sential medicines193 and to monitor country- specific pharmaceutical situations.194 The UN Millennium Project also has developed an indicator to measure \"the proportion of the population in each country with access to affordable essential drugs on a sustainable basis.\"195 These monitoring efforts by inter - national organizations are essential to the progressive realization of the right to health because they provide diagnosis and under - standing of medicine access at the global level and a comparative framework among countries, as well as motivate States to both monitor and improve medicine access within its population. 196 67. Pharmaceutical companies, as the major and sometimes primary provider of medicines to a population, have a responsibility to make adequate information about their practices and policies available so that external mecha - nisms to evaluate the role of industry in the context of access to medicines may be ful - filled.197 Pharmaceutical companies should also conduct internal monitoring of their ac - cess to medicines policies in accordance with Paul Hunt' s guidelines.198 Companies should pay particular attention to the impact of com - pany programs and policies on disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, and on neglected diseases.199 Pharmaceutical companies also have a critical role to play in the benchmark - ing of industry practices in the context of health.200 68. In terms of good practices, the Access to Medicine Index (AMI) is a valuable example of third party monitoring with respect to access to medicines. 201 AMI is an interna - tional non-profit organization that evaluates pharmaceutical industry progress in rela - tion to access to medicines, and identifies both good and bad industry practices.202 Every two years, AMI ranks pharmaceutical companies based on their performance in managing access to medicines, public policy, research, equitable pricing, patents, product development, and philanthropic donations.203 Initiatives, such as AMI, are essential to the progressive realization of health because they provide critical information to assessing medicine access in a State, highlight deficits in access, and identify the role of industry in addressing these gaps.204 C. Monitoring access to medicines requires disaggregating data and formulating appropriate indicators and benchmarks, and also should consider standardizing indicators and identifying good practices. 69. Disaggregation of data is essential for a State to meet its obligations under the ICESR, which requires States to obtain awareness and pay \"special attention\" to \"any worse-off 44 Health Law & Policy Briefregions or areas and to any specific groups or subgroups which appear to be particularly vulnerable or disadvantaged.\"205 In terms of its obligations to the right to health and the derivative right to access to medicines, dis - aggregation is critical to the State knowing whether its laws, policies, and health outreach programs for vulnerable and disadvantaged groups are effective.206 70. Types of indicators: Under the right to health, States must identify appropriate indicators to monitor the realization of the right to health.207 Although several methodologies have been proposed on how to monitor hu - man rights obligations, the most common approach relies upon structural, process, and outcome indicators.208 a) Structural indicators reflect the legal and policy environment necessary for the realization of human rights and \"capture the commitment or the intent of the State in undertaking measures\" related to these rights.209 Structural indi - cators provide a quick and cost-effective assessment and rely upon information that is easy to obtain.210 With respect to medicine access, these indicators consider whether \"key structures, sys - tems and mechanisms\" are in place to allow for greater access to medicines in a State211 (e.g., whether the State has constitutionalized the right to health, or whether compulsory licensing provi - sions for pharmaceuticals have been in - corporated into national legislation).212 b) Process indicators reflect the imple - mentation environment and measure the extent of activities necessary to realize human rights. 213 With regards to access to medicines, they evaluate the degree of activities that are necessary to improve access to medicines and the progress of those activities over time214 (e.g., is right to health is justiciable; how is the national strategy implemented).215c) Outcome indicators measure enjoyment of a human right.216 In this case, outcome indicators evaluate the availability, ac - cessibility, acceptability, and quality of medicines.217 To evaluate outcome indica - tors with respect to medicines, household surveys are useful for providing informa - tion on how drug policies affect access and individual wellbeing.218 71. Benchmarks: Under the right to health, set - ting benchmarks and indicators is necessary to monitor a State' s progress in expanding access to medicines.219 Thus far, benchmarks have not been effective with respect to access to medicines.220 States and other relevant actors should set realistic benchmarks that have been assigned a numerical value and are time-bound.221 Quantitative benchmarks, however, should not distract attention from addressing systematic and structural prob - lems that require solutions that are harder to quantify.222 72. Good Practices: As Paul Hunt has observed, \"[P]\"rogressive realization does not mean that a State is free to choose whatever meth - ods so long as they reflect some degree of progress. A State has a duty to adopt those measures that are most effective, while taking into account resource availability and other human rights considerations.\"223 Thus, when monitoring access to medicines, it is impera - tive to identify and disseminate information on good practices that can be transferred to other settings.224 Good practices include laws, policies, and programs that improve access to medicines, recognize vulnerable groups, and are consistent with the enjoyment of other human rights.225 73. Standardized international indicators are important to the progressive realization of the right to health and the derivative right to access to medicines because they allow for cross- country comparisons, cultivate greater trans - parency, and influence States to collect better data and improve medicine access.226 With regard to access to medicines, standardized 45 Winter 2013indicators and an operational definition of access to medicines are lacking.227 D. Monitoring is not sufficient; bad actors should be held accountable. 74. To create a meaningful system of account - ability, monitoring should be coupled with issuing consequences for those who fail to meet their obligations.228 Under the right to health, all persons and groups who are victims of right to health violations must have access to appropriate remedies.229 Consequences for violations may take many forms, including political, social, and administrative, but also should have a legal component,230 such that the violation of a right is met with the force of law.231 75. Accordingly, legal mechanisms, both domes - tic and international, should be developed and strengthened to hold bad actors, whether they be States or non-State actors, account - able for violations of the right to health, and the derivative right of access to medicines.232E. In conclusion, States are primarily responsible for monitoring access to medicines, but non- State actors also have responsibilities in this respect. Monitoring alone is insufficient. To ensure accountability, monitoring should be coupled with consequences for those who fail to meet their obligations under the right to health. V . CONCLUSION The right to health, and the derivative right of access to medicines, is based on the fundamental human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, re-affirmed in the International Covenant on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights, and articulated in numerous other international and regional human rights instruments.233 While States bear the primary duties to respect, protect, promote, and fulfill234 the right to health and the accompanying right of access to medicines, non-state actors, especially pharmaceutical companies, bear a shared responsibility, based on their particular capacities, to increase access to medicines.235 Furthermore, States must develop and utilize monitoring and accountability mechanisms to ensure that access to medicines is improved, and that those responsible for hindering or violating the right to health and access to medicines are held accountable.236 States are obligated to guarantee the right to health, and access to medicines, for all persons subject to their jurisdiction, as well as to ensure that non-state actors, including pharmaceutical companies in their jurisdictions, act to increase access to medicines, and that all actors hindering or otherwise violating these fundamental rights are held accountable.46 Health Law & Policy BriefappEnD iX MATRIX OF INDICATORS FOR THE RIGHT TO HEALTH AND DERIV ATIVE RIGHT TO ACCESS MEDICINES237 As part of their mandates to help States and others improve health outcomes and respect, protect, and fulfill the right to health, both PAHO and the UN Special Rapporteur to Health should encourage both States and non-State actors to establish and improve monitoring and accountability mechanisms with respect to access to medicines. This matrix provides a comprehensive tool for international actors and States to evaluate the progressive realization of the right to health. Because States bear the primary duty to monitor the right to health, this matrix is designed to help States understand their obligations under the right to health and the derivative right to access medicines while being able to self-evaluate how they are fulfilling their obligations relating to these rights. Additionally, the answers to this matrix ideally benefits non-state actors (like the UN and PAHO) who are working to monitor States, create benchmarks and indicators to assess the progressive realization of the right to health and derivative right to access medicines, and provide recommendations to States. For this purpose, the matrix relies on General Comment 14 to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to provide indicators demonstrating whether States are progressively realizing the derivative right to access medicines.238 Even though General Comment 14 explicitly pertains to the right to health generally, the right to access medicines is a derivative right encompassed by the right to health, and like the right to health, provides obligations that States must work toward fully implementing.239 The matrix below is by no means an exhaustive list of indicators nor is is tailored to a specific State. Further work needs to be carried out to carefully to assess the feasibility and importance of each indicator. A clearly articulated rationale should be provided for selecting priority indicators and excluding others. Based on this paper, this matrix serves as a suggestion for an evaluative tool to measure how a State is meeting its obligations to ensure access to medicines to its population. Explanation of Column Terms: 1. Obligations: This lists the specific human rights obligation being measured and whether it is categorized as obligation of the State to respect (R), protect (P) or fulfill (F) the right. Each of these three types of obligations should be addressed wherever they are relevant (See Section 3 of the main paper). A reference is provided to the paragraph in General Comment No. 14 on the Right to Health where this obligation is outlined. 2. Potential indicators: This is by no means an exhaustive list of indicators nor are they tailored to a specific State. This list of indicators is merely a suggestion of how to begin to think about what types of indicators could be considered when evaluating a State' s obligations to access to medicines under the Right to Health.240 3. S/P/O (Structural, Process or Outcome indicator): This classifies the proposed indicators according to the typology defined by the Report of the UN Special Rapporteur for the right to health (See Section 2.1 of the Concept Paper). This matrix mainly lists structural indicators because they are the quickest and most cost-effective indicators to evaluate a State' s obligation to health. Please note that the outcome indicators are broadly defined and further inquiry will need to done to access what are the most appropriate questions to ask to determine access to medicine outcomes.24147 Winter 2013Obligation Potential Indicators GENERAL INDICATORS Explicit State Recognition of the Right to Health or other Health Related Rights (R,P ,F)1.

States parties should ensure that a person' s actual or perceived health status is not a barrier to realizing the rights under the Covenant. The protection of public health is often cited by States as a basis for restricting human rights in the context of a person' s health status. However, many such restrictions are discriminatory, for example, when HIV status is used as the basis for differential treatment with regard to access to education, employment, health care, travel, social security, housing and asylum. States parties should also adopt measures to address widespread stigmatization of persons on the basis of their health status, such as mental illness, diseases such as leprosy and women who have suffered obstetric fistula, which often undermines the ability of individuals to enjoy fully their Covenant rights. Denial of access to health insurance on the basis of health status will amount to discrimination if no reasonable or objective criteria can justify such differentiation.\") [hereinafter General Comment 20]. 54 See id. \u00b6 3 (affirming that all economic, social and cultural rights, including the right to health, are for all person, pursuant to the principles of equality and non-discrimination). 55 General Comment 14, supra note 17, \u00b6 12(b) (advising that \"health facilities, goods and services must be accessible to all, especially the most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the population, in law and in fact, without discrimination on any of the prohibited grounds\").

Minister of Health, Kawazulu-Natal, Nov. 27, 1997, Const. Ct. of S. Afr. In Soobramoney , the first case in which the Constitutional Court of South Africa addressed the constitutional right to health care, the Court concluded that where a State has insufficient resources to meet the medical needs of its entire population, the State may choose to ration its resources, and accordingly to ration available medicines and medical technologies, based on reasonable decisions by the State' s government and good faith policies of independent and impartial medical authorities. ( Id.) Despite apparent recognition that such a policy would perpetuate inequities in access to health care, the Court reasoned that the right to health care did not stem from the right to life, and that health care rationing policies were acceptable if not unreasonably or unfairly applied. ( Id.) The Court' s decision in Soobramoney was criticized as unduly deferential and ultimately regressive in terms of the realization of human rights enshrined by the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and subsequent jurisprudence reflected more progressive reasoning. 57 See UDHR, supra note 17, art.22 (\"Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international co-operation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.\") See also ICESCR, supra note 17, art. 9 (\"[recognizing] the right of everyone to social security, including social insurance.\"). 58 See, e.g., Protocol of San Salvador, supra note 30, art. 9 (asserting the right to social security to protect individuals \"from the consequences of old age and of disability [which may prevent them] from securing the means for a dignified and decent existence.\") 59 General Comment No. 19: The right to social security (ICESCR art. 9) E/C.12/GC/19, \u00b6 13 (Feb. 4, 2008). 60 Id. \u00b6 2.; See also id. \u00b6 28 (\"The right to social security plays an important role in supporting the realization of many of the rights in the [ICESCR] ....\"). 61 Id. \u00b6 13 (\"[noting] the particular importance of the right to social security in the context of endemic diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, and the need to provide access to preventive and curative measures.\"). 62 See id. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 28. 63 See, e.g., Protocol of San Salvador, supra note 30, art. 7(e) (stating the right to safe and hygienic work conditions); art. 11(1) (asserting everyone' s right to live in a healthy environment and to have access to basic public services ) (emphasis added); art. 12 (asserting everyone' s \"right to adequate nutrition which guarantees the possibility of enjoying the highest level of physical, emotional and intellectual development ,\" and States Parties' obligations to \"promote the exercise of this right and eradicate malnutrition\") (emphasis added); Banjul Charter, supra note 30, art. 24 (\"All peoples shall have the right to a general satisfactory environment favourable to their development.\"). 64 See, e.g., Banjul Charter, supra note 30, art. 22 (\"All peoples shall have the right to their economic, social and cultural development with due regard to their freedom and identity and in the equal enjoyment of the common 55 Winter 2013heritage of mankind.

To prevent violation, States may choose to remedy those individuals whose rights have been violated by making the right to health justiciable within their jurisdictions. Remedy for violations of an individual' s right to health must be available either through the judiciary or through some other national complaint and remedy mechanism. Regardless of which complaint mechanism the State prefers to use, the plan of action in this regard should be based on the principles of accountability, transparency and independence of the judiciary. See General Comment 14 , supra note 20, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 55, 59, 61. 245 See discussion supra Part II. 246 See discussion supra Part II. Access to Medicine is related to the right to health because... Since the derivative right to access medicines falls under the overarching right to health, the same duties and obligations that apply to the right to health in Question 3 ( see supra note 8) regarding the judiciary and complaint mechanisms should apply as well here. See General Comment 14 , supra note 20, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 55, 59, 61. 247 Under an obligation to respect, States must refrain from interfering directly or indirectly with any derivative rights, like access to medicine, that fall under the right to health. See discussion supra Part II.B; General Comment 14 , supra note 20, \u00b6 33. 248 A core obligation under the right to health is that States must make health facilities, goods, and services accessible to all and within safe physical reach for all segments of the population, especially vulnerable or marginalized peoples. Vulnerable and marginalized people, as this term relates to the derivative right to access medicines, are individuals or a group of individuals who are unable, for reasons beyond their control, to realize access to medicines themselves without State action or interference. Because vulnerable and marginalized people hold special recognition throughout General Comment 14, they reappear throughout this matrix to ensure that all obligations are not only met generally, but are met as regards access for this group of people. See General Comment 14 \u00b6\u00b6 12(b), 37, 43(a). 249 As a general rule, State' s have an obligation to refrain from prohibiting or impeding traditional preventive care, healing practices and medicines. Such traditional healthcare may be restricted or limited where it consists of justifiably illicit acts or substances. Limitations are particularly justifiable where the illicit traditional healthcare affects legally protected vulnerable or marginalized groups. Any limitations regarding the right to health must be justifiable, proportional, and subject to review. See General Comment 14, supra note 20, \u00b6\u00b6 20-29, 34. 250 See discussion supra Part III.A.2. See General Comment 14 , supra note 20, \u00b6 39 (stating that States should ensure that the right to health is reflected in international agreements and that international agreements do not adversely impact the right to health). 251 See General Comment 14 , supra note 20, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 43(f) (discussing how State' s duty to fulfill includes the obligation to adopt and implement a national public health strategy and plan of action on the basis of disease prevalence. Disease prevalence is based in epidemiological evidence showing the primary health concerns of the whole population). 252 Adopting and implementing a national public health strategy and plan of action is a core obligation under the right to health. Recognition of the right to health in the national political and legal systems is accomplished through legislative implementation and adoption of a national health policy and detailed plan for realizing all aspects of the right to health including access to medicines. Refusing to implement a national policy and plan of action is a violation of the State' s obligation to fulfill the right to health. See General Comment 14 , supra note 20, \u00b6 36, 43(f), 49, 52. 253 National public health strategies and plans of action should be built with regard to domestic disease prevalence. In other words, strategies should be based in epidemiological evidence, addressing the health concerns of the whole population with particular regard for vulnerable and marginalized groups. National health strategies should also identify available resources, define health objectives, and demonstrate cost-effectiveness of resource allocation. See General Comment 14 , supra note 20, \u00b6 17, 43(f), 53 (disease prevalence cost effective); see also WHO, Health Topics: Essential Medicines , http://www.who.int/topics/ essential_medicines/en/. 254 See discussion supra Part II.A. See also General Comment 14 , supra note 20, \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12(a), 36. 255 National health strategies should particularly consider vulnerable and marginalized groups in all aspects. Inappropriate health resource allocation can lead to discrimination that may not be overt. In this regard, investments in national health policy and strategies should not disproportionately favor expensive curative health services which are often accessible only to a small, privileged fraction of the population, rather than primary and preventive health care benefiting a far larger part of the 64 Health Law & Policy Briefpopulation. Even in times of severe resource constraints, the vulnerable members of society must be protected by the adoption of relatively low-cost targeted programs. See General Comment 14 , supra note 20, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, 37, 52. 256 See General Comment 14 , supra note 20, \u00b6 52 (arguing that the obligation requires States to allocate a sufficient expenditure of public resources to the enjoyment of the right to health by individuals or groups, particularly the vulnerable or marginalized). 257 The obligation to fulfill requires that States adopt appropriate budgetary measures and allocate sufficient expenditures towards the full realization of the right to health including to support the derivative right to access medicines. States violate their obligation to fulfill when they are unwilling to use the maximum of their available resources for the realization of the right to health. Where resource constraints exist preventing the State from realizing the right to health, the State has the burden of justifying why sufficient allocation has not been made. Budgetary measures must not overtly benefit a small segment of the population to the detriment of all others and must also be used to reduce the inequitable distribution of health facilities, goods, and services. See General Comment 14, supra note 20, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 33, 47, 52, 53. 258 See supra notes 20-21 (noting that budgetary strategies may not discriminate against marginalized and vulnerable groups, and in some cases, need to take special action as regards these groups). 259 States have an obligation to promote medical research. General Comment 14 , supra note 20, \u00b6 36. 260 See id. \u00b6 36. 261 See supra note 17. 262 See supra note 19. 263 States have an obligation when evaluating health policies to involve effective community action in setting priorities, making decisions, planning, implementing and evaluating strategies to achieve better health. General Comment 14 , supra note 20 \u00b6 54. 264 See discussion supra Part IV .A. See General Comment 14, supra note 20 \u00b6 54. 265 The obligation to protect requires States to take measures that prevent third parties from interfering with the right to health. See General Comment 14 , supra note 20 \u00b6 33. 266 See discussion supra Part II.B and III.A and accompanying text. See General Comment 14 , supra note 20 \u00b6 33. 267 States have an obligation to monitor the progressive realization of the right to health. See General Comment 14 \u00b6\u00b6 43, 52, 56, 57, 58. 268 See discussion supra Part IV; General Comment 14 , supra note 20 \u00b6\u00b6 43, 52, 56, 57, 58. 269 States must disaggregate data related to the right to health.

See General Comment 14, \u00b6\u00b6 43,52, 54, 57, 58. See discussion supra Part IV .C.271 States should set up effective mechanisms to hold violators of the right to health accountable. See General Comment 14 \u00b6\u00b6 55, 59. See discussion supra Part IV .D. 272 States must cooperate internationally. See General Comment 14 \u00b6\u00b6 38, 39. See discussion supra Part IV .A. 273 States must allow and encourage the participation of civic society. See General Comment 14 \u00b6\u00b6 34, 54 . See discussion supra Part IV .A. 274 Health goods must be \"available in sufficient quantity within the State.\" General Comment 14 , supra note 20 \u00b6 12(a). 275 See e.g. , WORld HealtH ORganizatiOn , indicat ORs fOR mOnit ORing natiOnal dRug POlicies : a P Ractical manual , at 158-59 (2d. ed. 1999) (using the following as outcome indicators to evaluate availability of access to medicine: \"Number of drugs from a basket of drugs available in a sample of remote health facilities, out of total number of drugs in the same basket\"; \"Number of drugs at the lowest price from a basket of drugs, out of total number of drugs in the same basket\"). 276 Health goods must accessible to all without discrimination. See General Comment 14 , supra note 20 \u00b6 12(b). 277 Accessibility includes See e.g. 14 , supra note 20 \u00b6 12(b). 278 Accessibility includes economic accessibility.

These recommendations have been suggested by the Working Group on Access to Medicines that convened on March 21 and 22, 2012 at the Inaugural Conference on Global Health, Gender and Human Rights, which was organized by the American University Washington College of Law and PAHO/ WHO. The recommendations were recorded by the Working Group Secretary and reviewed and edited by Sean Flynn, of American University Washington College of Law, and James Fitzgerald and Javier Vazquez of PAHO. These recommendations do not necessarily reflect the views of the author(s) of the preceding article. The recommendations are divided by the following set of questions based on principles extracted from the PAHO Resolution \"Health and Human Rights\" (CD 50 R.8), approved by the 50th Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO). This resolution urges health authorities to use human rights treaties and standards to reform health systems, collaborate with the judiciary, legislators and civil society and train health workers on human rights obligations. Taking into account the national context, financial and legal framework and budgetary constraints of countries: a. Which areas require special attention from government agencies? The right to health, and the derivative right of access to needed medicines, should be integrated into all relevant economic and social policy, including the promulga - tion, interpretation and enforcement of intellectual property, consumer protection, competition, health safety, trade, customs and border control, criminal law and other forms of regulation that impact the prices and availability of medicines. The right to health must be a paramount and explicit concern in the negotiation and implementation of any trade agreement, technical assistance or other foreign pres - sure to revise domestic intellectual prop - erty policy. Countries should avoid entering commitments to implement \"TRIPS-plus\" intellectual property and related standards that may restrict access and affordability of medicines. Countries should ensure that all govern - ment planning takes into account duties to respect, protect and promote the right to health, and the derivative right of access to needed medicines. There should be transparency and opportu - nities for civil society to participate in the creation and implementation of all govern - ment policies and practices that impact access to needed medicines, including in the setting of reimbursement or acquisition policies as well as regulatory and enforce - ment policies and priorities. Governments should ensure access to affordable medication for vulnerable people, including impoverished and isolated populations. b. What key factors should be identified and included by health authorities and other governmental actors when formulating national health policies and plans consistent with the applicable international human rights instruments that advance access to medicines and technologies and protect individual rights to physical and mental health and other related human rights? All countries should include in their national health planning, a national medicine strategy that promotes the availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of medicines for all. Countries should promote meaningful participation by affected individuals and groups in decisions that affect access to medicines, including regulatory, pricing and patent decisions.66 Health Law & Policy Brief Policies should ensure that only medicines that have met scientifically appropriate standards for quality, safety and efficacy are available. Governments should promote the rational use of medicines, through treatment guide - lines based on the best available evidence. Medicines should be affordable for those that need them and Governments have to ensure that pricing policies are in effect that ensure such affordability, based on prin - ciples of equity. Medical practitioners and patients should have ready access to reliable, complete and unbiased information on the safety and ef - ficacy of medicines. Private providers of health services and fa - cilities, including medicine suppliers, must be regulated to comply with the principle of non-discrimination, particularly in relation to vulnerable groups. Policies should promote the affordability of medicines, including through intellectual property, competition, consumer protection and other policies that promote generic competition and equitable pricing. Countries should strengthen the technical capacity of their health authority to work with the corresponding governmental hu - man rights entities, such as ombudspersons' offices and human rights secretariats, to evaluate and oversee the implementation of the applicable international human rights instruments to protect and advance access to medicines and technologies. c. Which key provisions should be included by legislators and other actors when reviewing and reforming national health legislation, incorporating the international human rights instruments especially those that advance access to medicines and technologies? For example, the incorporation of a list of essential medicines or access to anti-retroviral treatments. Intellectual property legislation should be reformed to take full advantage of all flex - ibilities in the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property that promote access to affordable medicines. These flexibilities include the full scope of the provisions in TRIPS that promote limita - tions and exceptions to intellectual property rights \u2014 such as the right to grant compul - sory licenses for any reason \u2014 as well as the flexibility to define and implement unde - fined terms in the agreement \u2014 such as the freedom to define what inventions meet the standards for patentability under local law. Governments should formulate a list of essential medicines that are provided in all clinics and other providers in all parts of the country. Governments should also act to ensure that access is prioritized for other needed medicines that may not appear on the essential drugs list. Countries should develop pricing policies in public and private procurement and reimbursement programs that promote affordability, equity and the rational (evi - dence-based) selection and use of needed medicines. d. What measures should governments take to ensure the effective implementation of national health policies, plans and laws that protect and promote access to medicines and technologies in a manner consistent with universal and regional obligations on human rights? Governments must allocate an appropriate percentage of public expenditures to the provision of relevant infrastructure (such as health care facilities, delivery systems, and trained personnel). Governments should develop targeted plans of action and strategies with necessary budgetary support and appropriate timelines, and include prioritization of targeted strategies to address the specific needs of vulnerable and marginalized individuals and communities, including those who may have specific health needs. Models for monitoring & evaluation should be developed and implemented that ensure that adequate progress is made toward the full realization of the right to health, and the derivative right of access to medicines. Countries may consider incorporation of questions bearing on access to needed medicines in regular household surveys. The public interest in promoting widespread access to needed medicines 67 Winter 2013must be considered in setting enforcement and implementation policies related to Intellectual property, consumer protection and other laws regulating the pharmaceutical industry. When determining enforcement priorities related to intellectual property law, governments should consider all demands on enforcement resources and prioritize those that promote the right to health and other human rights over those demands that primarily bolster the market power of private firms without correlative advances in public health objectives. In setting enforcement and implementation policies, countries should use as a reference the WHO framework for monitoring rational use. Governments should create systems in which patent information and registration status for medicines is readily and publicly accessible. Governments should expedite the regulatory review and registration of needed medicines and create incentives for companies to register needed medicines expeditiously. Governments, individually and together with other States and non-governmental entities, should develop and implement need-based research and development programs to address currently neglected diseases and conditions. e. Parliaments and domestic courts play a key role in promoting and protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms. What concrete functions and contributions can those institutions make? For example, consider: the effects of judicialization in the context of progressive human rights (Ex: right to health) and human rights not subjected to limitation (Ex: Right to Life). The role of parliaments is discussed above. Judicial and health sectors need to work jointly to address the proliferation of judicial actions throughout some regions, through dialogue about the responsibilities of each sector in protecting human rights and promoting access to medicines based on best evidence available. Principles of public health must guide the dialogue and support decisions made by the State to ensure access to those medicines considered essential by the State. Human Rights instruments, principles and standards should be used by courts to interpret ambiguities in domestic law (including, e.g., intellectual property law and competition law) to promote the right to health and access to medicines. In countries where the right to health is included in the Constitution or regional human rights treaties and conventions, it should be enforced by courts. f. What measures could be taken by all those members of society at large who are involved in protecting the human rights with respect to access to medicines and technologies? Public interest organizations should be capacitated to act as human rights defenders, including to act in courts, legislatures and regulatory proceedings to ensure that human rights demands are furthered, and that rights are not interpreted to favor the demands of the wealthy at the expense of the poor. Taking into account the important role of international organizations, civil society and academic institutions on the promotion and protection of the right to health and other related human rights in the context of access to medicines and technologies: a. What measures could be taken by PAHO and technical teams of Washington College of Law and other universities to strengthen technical cooperation with the human rights committees, organs and rapporteurships of the 68 Health Law & Policy BriefUnited Nations and Inter-American systems (Such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights) in order to promote and protect the right to health and other related human rights? PAHO should work with WCL and other universities to convene a global expert network on the right to health and access to medicines to further define and operationalize recommendations on the right to health and access to medicines. This task should include a review and editing of the \"Matrix of Indicators for the Right to Health and Derivative Right to Access Medicines\" included as the appendix to the paper above. PAHO could work with the WHO to promote the creation of an international framework on access to needed medication and devices. Such an accord could be modeled on the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) and clarify the roles and responsibilities of all governmental and non- governmental parties and different levels. PAHO and WCL and other universities and partners should call for and participate in thematic hearings at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights on access to medicine issues. The issue of the potential impact on human rights of trade agreements being considered in the region should be prioritized.b. How could PAHO and other international agencies promote and stimulate collaboration and research with academic institutions, the private sector, civil society organizations and other social actors, when appropriate, to promote and protect human rights in keeping with the international human rights instruments? PAHO can help develop monitoring and evaluation systems and provide technical assistance on the adoption and implementa - tion of national health policies that promote access to medicines. c. How could PAHO and other international agencies, governments and academic institutions and civil society promote the sharing of good practices and successful experiences among countries regarding access to medicines and technologies in the context of human rights law obligations? PAHO can play a key role in providing sup - port to share practices between countries, in particular related to what is included on the essential medicines lists and on the policy mix needed to promote access to affordable medications in country. PAHO could work with universities and oth - ers to develop case studies that demonstrate best practices. PAHO can take further actions of the kind discussed in Resolution CD45R7 (2004) as well as in the proposed resolution that is going forward to the Pan American Sanitary Conference. 69 Winter 2013OlDER pERsOns, h Eal Th & h uman RighTs : aRE WE REaD y FOR pOpula TiOn agEing ? Saray Noda* I. INTRODUCTION Expanding longevity has been a consistent goal of the human race as people throughout history have tried to fight biology and fulfill their innate desire to live forever. Perhaps most famous were the ventures of new world explorers looking for the mythical fountain of youth. In many ways, we have made significant inroads; the twentieth century witnessed a worldwide increase in lifespan as a result of better nutrition, improved living conditions, and the advent of vaccinations. The twenty-first century brings new trends in this area, including exponential growth in the elderly population and increases in chronic disease that come naturally with age progression. The global population has aged dramatically in the past fifty years as people live longer and have fewer children.1 By 2050, the current population of 700 million people over the age of sixty will grow to two billion, composing twenty percent of the world' s population.2 Every month, one million people turn sixty, and eighty percent of them live in the developing world.3 Not surprisingly, there are considerable regional variations in how quickly populations are aging. Asia has aged the most due to low childbearing trends, which is further precipitated by China' s one-child policy.4 Countries in the Middle East and Western and Eastern Africa have witnessed slower increases in their populations largely due to lower life expectancy in underdeveloped regions.5 HIV/AIDS, maternal death, tuberculosis and malaria are the main factors contributing to high mortality in Africa.6 Despite these variations, demographic analyses indicate that the number of countries with ageing populations will continue to increase over the next forty years.7 Accomplishing increased longevity without including adequate human rights protections for older persons that assure dignity and access to resources needed by this group will constitute an immense failure by our global community. This population shift will require great adaptation by countries worldwide. The World Bank has described the next forty years as: [A] period of rapid population aging that will pose new social and economic challenges to the society and require the implementation of public policies and programs in multiple areas, including the provision of long term health care and the financing of pensions for a progressively ageing population.8 This paper will discuss current trends affecting older persons including age and employment discrimination, poverty, elder abuse, and inaccessibility to health care and increased chronic disease. Next, this paper will present current human rights instruments along with their ability to deal with these problems.9 Finally, this paper will discuss future population trends along with the imminent need for a convention specific to older persons.* Saray Noda is a nurse from New Jersey and third year law student at American University Washington College of Law, who hopes to practice health care law. This article is based on a paper that was presented at the Inaugural Conference on Global Health, Gender, and Human Rights, sponsored by the American University Washington College of Law, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Guatemala. The paper was written under the supervision of and in consultation with Matthew Pierce from the American University Washington College of Law; Dr. Enrique Vega, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Regional Advisor on Active and Healthy Ageing; Javier Vasquez, PAHO Regional Advisor on Human Rights Law; and Cristina Leria, PAHO consultant on human rights. Alejandro Morlachetti, PAHO consultant on human rights reviewed an earlier version of this paper. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the individual author and do not necessarily represent the position of PAHO, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Guatemala, the Health Law & Policy Brief, or the American University Washington College of Law.70 Health Law & Policy BriefII. CURRENT TRENDS & HUMAN RIGHTS INSTRUMENTS APPLICABLE TO OLDER PERSONS A. Age discrimination & employment discrimination Older persons continue to live in the shadows of stereotypes that reflect negative feelings towards the elderly and varying perceptions of what they are capable of accomplishing in the workplace and society. A recent longitudinal study in the United States found that sixty-three percent of older adults reported at least one type of everyday discrimination, of which thirty percent was based on age and twenty- two percent based on reported physical disability or appearance.10 \"[E]veryday discrimination still has significant independent effects on changes in emotional health, such as depressive symptoms and self-rated health.\"11 Previous studies have also shown that individuals with disadvantaged statuses have overall poor physical and emotional health.12 With negative outcomes associated with age discrimination, countries must make an effort to curtail and eventually eliminate this trend. Older persons, especially those who live in countries that do not provide pensions and are dependent on labor income, should be free of discrimination in the workplace. Changing population trends may require adjustment of pension systems (in countries where they exist) to sustainable models which will likely translate into later retirement for the workforce. Elder discrimination must be eliminated in order for those models to work. Trends. Unfortunately, there is a gap in data regarding worldwide age discrimination in the workplace. In the United States, employment discrimination claims brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act have increased over forty percent since 2006.13 Despite employees' seniority and expertise, companies often consider how older workers generally cost more when companies face financial difficulties. It may sometimes involve hiring a younger, less qualified candidate for a position as opposed to the older person, or refusing to consider applications from people over retirement age. Daniel Cotlear, lead health economist at the World Bank, stated that \"[e]nacting laws against age discrimination should be explored because of indications in some Latin American countries that older workers already face real discrimination in the workplace.\"14 In Latin America, labor market income is a significant source of income for the ageing, especially those who do not receive pensions or other sources of income.15 For those older persons (over age sixty) who do not receive pensions, over forty percent remain in the labor market, and a significant portion continue to work past the age of eighty.16 In low pension countries, wages for older persons are a fraction of the wages received by younger adults.17 However, in pro-aging and high pension countries, the elderly work if paid attractively, which usually means at higher wages than for younger adults.18 Some pension countries have mandatory retirement ages, which have traditionally encouraged early retirement. Involuntary retirement can be detrimental to social adjustment and wellbeing.19 However, increasing countries' dependency ratios and concerns regarding unsustainable pension liabilities may reverse this trend; and instead, increase older worker participation in the labor force. Once countries increase retirement ages, the concern then becomes preserving the ability of older persons to retire with dignity and economic security while continuing to build a sustainable pension model.20 Countries must work to establish this balance. Efforts by Countries. Countries have made varied efforts to respond to calls for action by the UN and Inter-American bodies regarding age discrimination. Several countries already have provisions in their constitutions regarding age discrimination either by explicit reference or by disallowing general discrimination based on \"any other grounds.\"21 The United States Supreme Court has refused to treat the elderly as a suspect class subject to Equal Protection,22 although claims can be made through the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. National legislation is also a channel through which other countries are addressing age discrimination.23 Other countries have delegated implementation of policies to local governments, reasoning that localities understand the needs of beneficiaries and have a closer link to the communities they serve.24 Decentralization, however, is not effective if local governments are not provided the funding or effective 71 Winter 2013powers to help the elderly. Delegation brings about the most critical delays in implementation of programs for older persons.25 Current Human Rights Instruments. Because no specific binding instrument for older persons has been adopted, the legal protections available to older persons have come as a result of interweaving various general human rights instruments.26 The norms in existing international human rights treaties apply to older persons in the same way as to other persons. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (\"ICCPR\"), a binding instrument, holds in Article 10 that persons \"shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person.\"27 Article 26 views all persons as equal and entitled to be free of discrimination with full protection of the law.28 Also, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (\"ICESCR\") when coupled with the committee' s General Comment 6, provides the most comprehensive analysis of the rights of older persons currently available. Article 6 recognizes the right to work, at any age, including \"policies to achieve steady economic, social and cultural development.\"29 This means freedom from age discrimination in the workplace as the elderly face a number of problems finding and maintaining employment when they reach retirement age.30 Most notably, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) specifically addresses age in many of its provisions.31 According to the Convention, States Parties should adopt immediate, effective and appropriate measures to combat stereotypes, prejudices and harmful practices relating to persons with disabilities, including those based on age.32 In relation to access to justice for persons with disabilities, states parties shall provide \"age-appropriate accommodation.\"33 The CRPD further provides that States shall ensure freedom from exploitation, violence and abuse and provide \"age-sensitive\" assistance and support34; in the context of the right to health, to provide services designed to minimize and prevent further disabilities, including among children and older persons,35 and to social protection programs for older persons with disabilities.36Ensuring freedom from age discrimination is consistent with the UN' s Vienna International Plan of Action on Aging,37 which recognizes the ability of older persons to enjoy a life of fulfillment where they are appreciated as integral parts of society.38 The Vienna Plan has been considered a \"very useful guide\" by member states.39 Another plan, The Madrid Plan, also adopted by the UN, recognizes active participation by older persons in the economies of their countries.40 The Madrid Plan places the primary responsibility on national governments and fails to call for the development of a specific human rights instrument for the protection of older persons.41 Basic civil and political rights in the CPR provide immediate protection and supervision, as opposed to those rights classified as economic social and cultural rights in the ESCR, which are often thought of as goals or aims that do not resemble private enforceable rights.42 Elderly rights are frequently characterized as \"rights of progressive implementation,\" which means that \"states are not immediately required to fully realize those rights in their jurisdictions, as they are only goals or aims that will be attained to the maximum of the states' available resources.\"43 Most frequently civil and political rights are used to protect the elderly against labor prison sentences, serving jail time, inhumane treatment in health facilities, and for preservation of rights to pensions and social security benefits.44 From the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, perhaps the most commonly accepted provision, holding that all people deserve an adequate standard of living, health, and wellbeing, arguably come a penumbra of rights including equality and freedom from employment discrimination. In many countries, the economic survival of the elderly is dependent on their success in the workplace, which cannot occur if they are subject to discrimination. B. Poverty Trends. Older persons over the age of eighty experience greater vulnerability and poverty.45 This is due to the tendency of those eighty and older to be dependent on a variety of sources of income.46 Moreover, although individuals over sixty are generally no more likely to be impoverished than individuals of other ages, many people over age 72 Health Law & Policy Briefsixty face financial challenges associated with their age. In addition to employment discrimination, inadequate pensions are a problem for older persons in many countries.47 \"[T]he incidence of income poverty among those who receive pensions is significantly lower than the incidence of poverty among beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries of pensions,\" reports the World Bank.48 In most Latin American countries, less than forty percent of the aging population over sixty receives pensions.49 Pensions play a greater role in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay \u2014 countries known as \"pro-aging.\"50 Labor market income in Latin American Counties is also significant for the elderly, especially those not receiving pensions.51 Over forty percent of those over sixty who do not receive pensions stay in the labor market.52 Poverty for the elderly in the U.S. was measured at 15.9% in 2011, almost double the ordinary measure.53 In calculating poverty, the Census Bureau now deducts medical expenses from income, which accounts for the great increase in the measure of poverty for the elderly in the U.S.54 Older women often experience poverty at higher rates.55 \"The impact of gender inequalities in education and employment becomes most pronounces in old age.\"56 As a result, older women are more likely than older men to be poor,\" reported the UN.57 In Latin America, greater inequality in household per capita income exists in all countries with the exception of the four pro-aging countries \u2014 Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay. \"Everywhere, pensioners have significantly lower poverty rates than non-pensioners [....] But in most countries, pensions are not a significant source of income for most over- 60' s, since less than 40 percent of the ageing receive pensions.\"58 The regional survey of ageing, health, and well-being (\"SABE\") found that sixty-two percent of older persons could not meet basic needs for daily living on their monthly income.59 Poverty in older persons is especially concerning due to poor health outcomes and access to healthcare. Current Human Rights Instruments. The International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (\"ICESCR\") asks countries to ensure the equal footing of men and women in economic, social and cultural rights.60 This includes the provision of non-contributory old-age benefits for the elderly, regardless of sex, to account for the fact that some women are left without pension because they spent all or part of their lives caring for their families.61 Article 11 of the ICESR gives all the right to an adequate standard of living including adequate food, clothing and housing with continued improvement of living conditions, \"recognizing the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger.\" Adequate housing includes policies to help the elderly live at home for as long as possible, and the improvement of spaces to allow continued access and use.62 However, as discussed above the classification of these rights as economic and social rights gives the perception that they are only aims or goals. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has recognized that although the ICESCR does not make an explicit reference to older persons within the \"right to social security,\" their rights are implicitly recognized within Article 9 which provides for, \"the right of everyone to social security, including social insurance.\"63 The CESCR has also clarified that the right to social security encompasses both contributory, insurance-type schemes and non-contributory, tax-funded schemes (sometimes referred to as \"social assistance\").64 Older persons may also use civil and political rights to protect their rights to social security and pensions. Unfortunately, case law has demonstrated the limitations of creative use of instruments, as civil and political rights have mainly been applied to the field of social security only where the country has already independently enacted those benefits. The rights to fair trial, equal protection, and property have been and continue to be used to ensure non-capricious provision of social benefits including pensions.65 However, potential for greater change using these rights has limitations. The Human Rights Committee in Brooks v. Netherlands ,66 recognized that, although Article 26 of the ICCPR requires equality under the law, the provision could not require a state to enact laws to provide social security, and could only play a role once legislation granting social security was adopted by the state.67 The petitioner in Brooks was contesting legislation that solely provided disability benefits to married women who were breadwinners or separate from their husbands.68 Brooks did not 73 Winter 2013fall under either category.69 The committee held that Article 26 was not applicable because the right to social security was not covered by the ICESR.70 It is also notable that litigation in human rights fora tends to involve a lengthy process \u2014 often plaintiffs must exhaust all remedies in their respective countries \u2014 and receiving a hearing in a reasonable amount of time can be difficult.71 In Deumeland v. Germany ,72 the European Court on Human Rights found a violation of the right to a hearing within a reasonable time where the petitioner waited eleven years for a hearing regarding her widow pension. The court also noted that social security cases require \"particular diligence.\"73 It was also noted that poverty is not a unique problem plaguing the elderly, as it is common in other groups such as women and children. However, the elderly are frequently left out of development agendas. The UN in the Madrid Plan recognized the continued need for social and economic growth of developing countries so that the elderly (along with other groups) can receive the adequate care and support they need.74 The Madrid Plan also asks countries to keep in mind the needs of both the young and old.75 C. Elder Abuse Trends. Elder abuse is severely underreported, with estimates from the World Health Organization of only one in fifteen cases to one in six cases actually being reported.76 There has also been a great deal of underreporting of elder abuse by physicians, an alarming two percent as compared to reports from family members (20 percent), hospitals (17.3 percent) and home health aides (9.6 percent).77 Calculating prevalence rates of elder abuse itself is a problem, and poor statistics are available largely due to underreporting and refusal by societies to admit the prevalence of abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation of elders.78 \"[R]eview of legislation in the Latin American region shows that 80 percent of countries have some form of legislation or policy that protects the rights of older persons, including the training and monitoring of elder abuse in long term facilities.\"79 However, resources are not allocated for adequate enforcement of policies. The needless use of restraints on older persons is also a violation of their human rights.80 Restraints are commonly misused to substitute for lack of personnel in long term facilities and to replace therapeutic interventions.81 Although there is a lack of statistical data on trends surrounding the widespread use of restraints, a study of institutionalized persons with physical and mental disability found that seventy-three percent of facilities surveyed stated that the reason for restraining residents was to protect them from falls.82 In the U.S., statistical data regarding restraints is usually obtained from Medicare reporting by institutions; researchers doubt the reliability of self- reporting by facilities that show a decrease in the use of restraints.83 Current Human Rights Instruments . The Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, included a commitment by countries to \"take effective legislative, administrative, judicial, or other means to prevent acts of torture in any territory under its jurisdiction.\"84 The Convention against Torture can be used for the protection of older persons living in public institutions if their mental and physical health is in danger.85 The Committee against Torture has also specifically clarified that State Parties should prohibit, prevent and redress torture and ill-treatment including, inter alia , in institutions that engage in the care of the aged.86 The Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture gives States the responsibility to prevent torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman treatment in their jurisdiction. Both of these instruments can be used to protect the elderly receiving inhumane treatment in healthcare facilities. However, the conventions arguably could not be used to ensure that countries implement preventative measures, including training of health care professionals and inspections of facilities. These instruments have force once the human rights violation has already occurred. Some decisions adopted by the Inter-American System of Human Rights are relevant to older persons. They can result in preventive policies and practices where older men and women are deprived of their liberty in public or private institutions (such as hospitals, psychiatric facilities, health centers, 74 Health Law & Policy Briefprisons, or other institutions) without sufficient guarantees or respect for their personal integrity, thereby harming older people' s physical and mental health.87 In December 2003, the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights for the first time granted precautionary measures to stop and prevent further ongoing abuses in a psychiatric institution in Paraguay.88 Further, in Congo vs. Ecuador , the Commission asserted that \" a violation of the right to physical integrity is even more serious when a person is under the custody of the State in a particularly vulnerable position .\"89 Most recently, in an unprecedented decision, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Ximenes- Lopes v. Brazil ,90 imposed liability on Brazil for human rights violations related to institutionalized people with mental disabilities.91 Damiao Ximenes- Lopes was placed in the care of a public clinic for his psychiatric treatment and died three days after admission due to ill-treatment and violent attacks from clinic personnel.92 His family sought redress on the local level but faced numerous irregularities with the investigation and autopsy.93 The court found Brazil in violation of Articles 1, 4, 5, 8 and 25 of the American Convention of Human Rights including the right of physical integrity and life and rights to due process and justice.94 \"The Court considers that the States must regulate and supervise all activities related to the health care given to the individuals under the jurisdiction thereof, as a special duty to protect life and personal integrity, regardless of the public or private nature of the entity giving such health care.\"95 The precedents set by the Inter-American human rights system can also be applied to protect and to prevent violations of the rights of older persons in the context of institutionalization in long-term care facilities. D. Health Care and Chronic Diseases Trends. Countries have also failed to address the health care needs of the elderly. In its Follow-up to the Second Assembly on Ageing, the U.N. stated the following: Currently, the discourse on health care in low and middle income countries remains strongly focused on maternal and child health .... There is also limited attention to non-communicable diseases, despite that ageing is a key driver of such diseases ... Additionally, the cost of accessing health care and medicines still remains prohibitive for many of the most marginalized older women and men.96 These systems of health care encourage the entry of older persons at advanced stages of illness when there is little to be done to ensure positive health outcomes but where costs tend to be the highest. Long term care continues to be inadequate and of low quality, as well as mainly a private industry, which affects government' s abilities to regulate and sustain these systems.97 A study by the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health of Older Persons suggests that a paradigm shift from a \"needs-based approach\" to a \"rights based approach\" for health care is necessary to address access problems in the elderly.98 Although chronic disease is an inevitable consequence of living longer, preventative care has a great influence on the combined number of chronic diseases suffered, age of onset, and severity. The WHO estimates that heart disease, stroke and diabetes alone account for an estimated one to five percent reduction of yearly Gross Domestic Product in developing countries.99 The cost of chronic disease is associated not only with seeking medical treatment but also with loss of labor.100 The World Bank estimates that chronic diseases plague one- third of the poorest in developing countries.101 About sixty percent of all deaths globally are caused by the main non-communicable diseases: diabetes, heart disease, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases.102 \"The epidemic of NCD' s ... is the product of failed development: of unhealthy urbanization, of poor trade and policy choices and of health systems unprepared for those most in need of care. A fundamental economic and development choice is thus facing the world today.\"103 The UN estimates that forty to fifty percent of those who present with heart disease, stroke, and type-2 diabetes are in premature stages and could largely be prevented by eliminating tobacco, promoting healthy diets, increasing physical activity and reducing alcohol consumption.10475 Winter 2013Current Human Rights Instruments. Article 12 of the ICESR asks countries to secure the right of citizens to \"the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health\" by providing prevention and treatment of diseases (which can be interpreted to include chronic illnesses). Clearly, the growing number of chronic, degenerative diseases and the high hospitalization costs they involve cannot be dealt with only by curative treatment. In this regard, States parties should bear in mind that maintaining health into old age requires investments during the entire life span, basically through the adoption of healthy lifestyles.105 Much like the right to pensions, health care has been classified as an economic and social right, an \"aim or goal\" to be attained by countries. However, this classification is unacceptable because health is an essential right and fundamental for the exercise of all other \"basic\" rights, such as civil and political rights. The Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (\"CEDAW\") acknowledges the equal right to adequate healthcare.106 The Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,107 a binding instrument on countries that have adopted it in the Inter-American system, guarantees in Article 10 that every person should enjoy the highest level of physical, mental, and social well-being. \"In order to achieve the 'right to health,' the States must agree to recognize health as a public good, prevent further abuses, and promote education on health problems,\" states the Pan-American Health Organization.108 Article 17 contains a special provision for the protection of older persons by pledging to gradually supply suitable facilities as well as food and specialized medical care for older persons who lack them. Article 18 recognizes the right of the disabled, including older persons, to have special medical care and rehabilitation.III. THE FUTURE STATUS OF OLDER PERSONS AND THE CALL FOR AN EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT Projections of world-wide population shifts, specifically in regard to exponential growth in elderly populations are eye-opening and incredibly concerning. On a world-wide scale, projections indicate that by 2050, the number of persons over sixty will increase from 700 million to 2 billion.109 \"Currently 1 person in every 10 is aged 60 years or over; by the year 2050 more than 1 in every 5 will be aged 60 years or over.\"110 The amount of older persons is expected to match that of the youth population for the first time in history around 2050.111 By 2050, the older population is expected to surpass the youth population by thirty percent.112 In many countries, including the U.S. and Mexico, the elderly are expected to compose one-fourth of the population. By 2025, the percentage of older women in the developing world will increase to seventy- five percent.113 For developing countries the old age dependency ratio \u2014 the number of persons sixty- five and over per one hundred persons aged fifteen to sixty-four years \u2014 could more than double in the next fifty years; whereas, in the past doubling has only occurred within spans of 150-200 years.114 The United Nations has recognized that as a global community we need to change the way we think about aging. \"When ageing is embraced as an achievement, the reliance on human skills, experiences and resources of the higher age groups is naturally recognized as an asset in the growth of mature, fully integrated, humane societies.\"115 It is not constructive to perceive the elderly as detached from our social and economic systems. \"Active Aging\" needs to be our goal. Given the increase in dependency ratios and longevity, current pension systems no longer meet the needs of many elderly populations. We must therefore increase the retirement age and availability of tasks that the elderly can perform within the workplace. This will increase the amount of funds available so that the governments can continue to support the economic needs of the elderly. We must also build and maintain a positive perception of the elderly. The elderly are equally as important as younger population groups, 76 Health Law & Policy Briefespecially since they are increasingly becoming a larger part of the composition of our population. Elder abuse must also be given recognition as a serious social and public health issue.116 Elder abuse is currently considered taboo, akin to domestic violence before it was recognized as a legitimate social concern. \"Twenty or thirty years ago, societies throughout the world denied the existence of violence against women and child abuse. Then, through research, came the evidence. As a result the civil society exercised the appropriate pressure for action from governments. The parallel with elder abuse is clear.\"117 Also, given the discrepancy in life expectancy between elderly women and men, we must increase resources to protect those women who are left alone after the death of their significant other. Elderly women can also be especially vulnerable due to former customs of economic dependence on others and tendencies to stay out of the labor market. \"Physicians and policy makers should understand that aging affects women and men differently. This recognition is critical to ensuring equality between older men and women and for providing adequately for their physical, mental, and social needs.\"118 Health care systems also need to respond and adapt to the increase in elderly population. We must establish adequate systems of long-term care. Coordination of care is also very important along with encouraging better self-care. In order to best address the needs of the elderly, countries have to stop thinking of aging as a cookie cutter process for every individual. \"Older persons are not a homogenous group and should not be treated as such. The experience of old age is different for men and women and it also differs significantly between someone in his or her 60s or 80s.\"119 However, older persons share the experience of living under the stereotype of societal perceptions of ageing, political disempowerment, and economic and social disadvantage. The human rights situation of the elderly has been analogized to that of children, but distinguished based on the large amount of specific protections for children. Aging leaves older persons equally as vulnerable as children \u2014 dependent on others for essential needs and victims of abuse. The \"convention [on the Rights of the Child] focuses on a group that is defined on the basis of age and that is considered to be especially vulnerable.\"120 In addition, other regional instruments have chosen to focus on other specific vulnerable populations including the indigenous and disabled communities providing a model of how to address the rights of the elderly within a legal framework.121 Future drafters of an instrument focused on the elderly must think about enforcement and the type of supervision necessary to assure adequate compliance.122 For example, the UN designates supervisory bodies for each treaty and the Inter-American system has designated monitoring to the Inter-American Court and Inter-American Commission.123 The current situation of the elderly clearly demonstrates that self-regulation by individual countries is simply not enough to promote enforcement and change. The need for an internationally enforceable specific instrument to address the needs of the elderly is clear. Roedolf Kay of the South African Older Persona Forum said it best: \"All older persons, whether healthy or frail, deserve to be treated with respect and dignity and to have their rights upheld. Human rights don't stop at 60!\"124 1 U.N. Dep't of Econ. and Soc. Affairs Population Div., Worldwide Population 1950-2050 , 5, U.N. Doc.

These recommendations have been suggested by the Working Group on Older Persons that convened on March 21 and 22, 2012 at the Inaugural Conference on Global Health, Gender and Human Rights, which was organized by the American University Washington College of Law and PAHO/WHO. These recommendations do not necessarily reflect the views of the author(s) of the preceding article. The recommendations are divided by the following set of questions based on principles extracted from the PAHO Resolution \"Health and Human Rights\" (CD 50 R.8): Taking into account the national context, financial and legal framework and budgetary constraints of countries: a. Which areas require special attention from government agencies? Promote and strengthen training programs for health workers working in long term care facilities for older persons on the applicable international human rights instruments; Strengthen the technical capacity of the health authority to provide support for the formulation of health policies and plans on aging consistent with the applicable international human rights instruments related to health; Establish a process to review the legal capacity for older persons who have been placed in long term care facilities by their families and provides a mechanism to transfer those persons who can return to the community; Raising awareness among care providers about the capacity of older persons to make medical decisions; and Establish mechanisms to protect private patients' information and provide access to their own information (medical files, etc.). b. What key factors should be identified and included by health authorities and other governmental actors when formulating national health policies and plans consistent with the applicable international human rights instruments that protect older persons rights to physical and mental health and other related human rights? Ensure participation of older persons and their organizations in the design; implementation and monitoring of national health policies, plans and laws; and Educational materials about the rights of older persons should be developed and dis - tributed in governmental agencies, universi - ties and schools, among others. c. Which key provisions should be included by legislators and other actors when reviewing and reforming national health legislation, incorporating the international human rights instruments especially those protecting older persons? Adopt laws and policies that bar discrimina - tion against older persons in the workplace and provide enforceable remedies for violations; Right to a periodic review of admissions in long term care facilities; Incentivize family caregivers that provide for older persons. (For example, Medicaid provides subsidies for family members who provide care); Right to the protection of private data; and Create incentives for corporations to employ older persons. d. What measures should governments take to ensure the effective implementation of national health policies, plans and laws that protect older persons?81 Winter 2013 Establish training programs in technical ar - eas, especially those most closely involved in protecting the health of older persons gradually incorporate the international human rights instruments related to health into their programs; Revise existing curricula in universities to include the human rights of older persons; and Make modules (user friendly and efficient) available on human rights instruments pro - tecting human rights of older persons. e. Parliaments and domestic courts play a key role in promoting and protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of older persons. Formulate and, if possible, adopt legisla - tive, administrative, educational, and other measures to disseminate the applicable inter - national human rights instruments on protect - ing the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and other related human rights among the appropriate person - nel in the legislative and judicial branches and other governmental authorities. f. What measures could be taken by all those members of society at large who are involved in protecting the human rights of older persons? Consider for example: Promote, as appropriate, the dissemination of information and knowledge among civil society organizations and other social actors on the applicable international human rights instruments related to health, to address stigmatization, discrimination, and exclu - sion of older persons; Promote the inclusion of older persons' rights into the agenda of human rights orga - nizations; and Encourage law schools and civil society to bring target litigation on behalf of older persons and thereby expand case law at domestic, regional and universal levels. Taking into account the important role of international organizations, civil society and academic institutions on the promotion and protection of the right to health and other related human rights in the context of older persons: a. What measures could be taken by PAHO and technical teams of Washington College of Law and other universities to strengthen technical cooperation with the human rights committees, organs and rapporteurships of the United Nations and Inter-American systems (such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights) in order to promote and protect the right to health and other related human rights of older persons? Formulation of technical opinions on health; Participation in thematic hearings at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and UN treaty bodies; Visits to health centers and other institutions such as long term care facilities for older persons and prisons in countries; and Provide support to the drafting and adoption of an international and or Inter-American Convention on the human rights of older persons to address their specific needs, rights and challenges. b. How could PAHO and other international agencies promote and stimulate collaboration and research with academic institutions, the private sector, civil society organizations and other social actors, when appropriate, to promote and protect human rights in keeping with the international human rights instruments that protect older persons? Work with the media as to how to spread a positive image of older persons; Engage universities to train the media about changes in demographics and health and human rights of older persons; and Incentivize more research in academic institutions regarding discrimination in the workplace for older persons. c. How could PAHO and other international agencies, governments and academic institutions and civil society promote the sharing of good practices and successful experiences among countries so as to prevent stigmatization, discrimination and exclusion of older persons? Coordination of joint initiatives in order to set up a network for global, regional and national collaboration and dissemination to share good practices related to the human rights of older persons.82 Health Law & Policy BriefBasic cOncEpTs , cOmmEnT aRy anD OppORTuniTiEs FOR aDDREssing hEal ThcaRE inEqualiTy OF WOmEn WiTh DisaBiliTiEs Gary C. Norman*1 INTRODUCTION This article will explore the barriers, legal issues or policy tensions resulting from the interaction of or the relationship between gender and healthcare from the perspective of people with disabilities.2 Women with disabilities will constitute the focus of this article as they experience discrimination based on disability as well as discrimination based on gender.3 Notably, this author has a goal that this particular article provides a tangible and helpful tool for public officials on improving healthcare access and quality.4 The prevalence of disability,5 and an exploration of the different prisms through which society understands disability as a construct, will be discussed. The article will subsequently juxtapose disability in the context of international human rights law and policy with the outstanding barriers experienced by disabled women in accessing healthcare services. At the conclusion of the article, the author will incorporate a set of recommendations for civil societies as they seek to design and implement compliance strategies consistent with the mandates of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.6 II. PREV ALENCE OF DISABILITY: A SIGNIFICANT, BUT MOVING TARGET Persons with disabilities constitute the world' s largest minority population. More than a billion people, or about 15% of the world' s population, are estimated to live with some form of disability.7 In addition, it is estimated that twenty percent of the poorest people in the global community have a disability; they are often recognized as the most disadvantaged by their own communities.8 Furthermore, it is estimated that citizens of nations with a life expectancy above seventy years of age will spend an average of eight years as a disabled person.9 Concisely, the author will note some statistics about the region of the Americas. In the region of the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization has estimated that 1 in 10 persons have some form of disability.10 As of 2010, there are approximately fifty-six million citizens with disabilities in the United States, or about nineteen percent of the population.11 Data illuminates that women with disabilities, the focus of this article, constitute a significant proportion of overall persons with disabilities.12 Globally, women and girls who have some form of physical disability, mental disability, or some combination of disabilities thereof, equal in the range of three hundred million individuals.13 Women constitute three-fourths of people with disabilities in low- and middle-income countries.14 According to the World Health Organization, about 450 million people have a mental health disability.15 Mental health disabilities, including depression, disproportionately * This article is based on a paper that was presented at the Inaugural Conference on Global Health, Gender, and Human Rights, sponsored by the American University Washington College of Law, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Guatemala. The paper was written in consultation with Matthew Pierce from the American University Washington College of Law ; Dr. Armando Vasquez, PAHO Regional Advisor on Disability and Rehabilitation, Javier Vasquez, PAHO Regional Human Rights Law Advisor; and Cristina Leria, PAHO Consultant on Human Rights; Janet Lord, Senior Partner, Blue LawInternational; and Stephanie Ortoleva, Founder and Co-Chair of Women Enabled. Alejandro Morlachetti, PAHO Consultant on Human Rights, reviewed an earlier version of this paper. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the individual authors and do not necessarily represent the position of PAHO, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Guatemala, the Health Law & Policy Brief, or the American University Washington College of Law.83 Winter 2013affect women and girls.16 While providing more information on the number of disabled persons, either by kind of disability or by region, is perhaps beyond the scope of this article; the key point is that people with disabilities, significantly comprised of women and girls,17 constitute the largest minority group within the global community.18 The number of disabled people is on the rise. The expansion in the number of the disabled is due to increased longevity and an aging population; but it is also due to violence and armed conflicts.19 By 2025, the number of aged 60 or over is expected to double, reaching a staggering 1.2 billion persons.20 Throughout the world, the fastest growing segment of national populations is that of persons eighty-five years or older;21 and many of those persons are women because of their longevity.22 Women particularly sustain the brunt of conflict, becoming disabled at disproportionate rates to men.23 Moreover, it should be noted that poverty has a substantial impact on the number of the disabled; this is particularly true with regard to women who are disproportionately affected by poverty.24 As such, civil societies should recognize that disability will increase in the global community \u2014 not vanish. III. WHAT DOES THE DEFINITION, DISABILITY, MEAN? A disabled woman could have a myriad of opportunities for equal living, learning, and earning if her disability is understood as an facet of diversity; therefore, receiving adequate accommodations.25 A disabled woman will be circumscribed in her opportunities if she is viewed as diseased and needing a cure. However, a disabled woman may have myriad opportunities for equal living, learning, and earning if the consequences of her disability are understood as a part of diversity, and the extent to which her disability imposes barriers, they should be accommodated.26 Consequently, a discussion of the medical versus social models of disability will occur at this point of the article.27 At the working group, one of the discussants commented that the \"working paper\" did not address, in an adequate way, the interplay of the models of disabilities, namely the medical model versus the social model of disability. Alas. While there is a moment to explore the models, there is neither the time nor the purview to focus this article on the models of disability. The author has the hope that the concise discussion as well as a comparison among an issue that arose in furnishing healthcare services to a woman with an intellectual disability and a hypothetical example will demonstrate the difference among the models of disability. The medical model is often noted as a factor in the lack of an accessible society for the disabled, including, but not limited to healthcare system.28 Society analyzes the disability of individuals in the medical model from a biomedical framework, defining disability through pathology and any resulting exclusions as \"inherent in the individual\" rather than the result of the interaction between impairments and physical barriers, programmatic barriers, or other barriers.29 The medical model has a fundamental presumption under-girding its focus on the inabilities rather than abilities of the disabled; namely the disabled cannot constitute contributing members of society until cured.30 \"Even in the context of an international human rights system of treaties and monitoring bodies, disability has not always been understood as a rights issue, but viewed instead [consistent with the medical model] as a pathology of exceptional individuals.\"31 In the medical model, people with disabilities are ill; as such, they may be excused from meeting normal social obligations. In addition, disabled people are malingerers if they do not submit to the treatments of medical providers and seek a cure.32 Thus, the medical model has33, resulted in discrimination, and marginalization.34 An alternative to the medical model of disability is the social model of disability. All citizens, including the disabled, should have affirmative human rights in today' s society. The social model of disability supports this notion, focusing on the need of society to accept the human diversity of people with disabilities and to accommodate their disabilities.35 As such, where physical or other barriers; or where discriminatory attitudes prevent the full inclusion of the disabled, they should be removed.36 Under this social model, or rights model, a person with disabilities, like all other persons, should receive any such supports and services necessary to exercising a full range of human rights.37 Slowly, if 84 Health Law & Policy Briefsteadily, society is, because of legal instruments like the Convention, in transition from the medical to the social model of disability.38 Given this background, comparing an example of an issue that arose in furnishing healthcare services to a woman with a disability and a hypothetical example of an issue much debate in the deaf or hard of hearing community might be helpful.39 An example of the medical model of disability may be found in a case of a woman with an intellectual disability and her eligibility for a life-saving transplant. The surgeons at a renowned education hospital balked at placing the woman with an intellectual disability on the waiting list for a transplant, believing she could not meet the post-transplant regimen.40 If a social model reigns supreme, then the obligation is on society to create and foster accommodations that equalize the status of disabled persons with the able-bodied. Technology, such as programs allowing a person with a hearing impairment to receive test results (communicated via a voicemail) into text is the kind of social model influenced advancement.41 Of particular interest to the discussion about the models of disability and how the disabled themselves are seeking to understand disability, there has been a debate in the deaf community about collier implants. There is a segment of the deaf community who culturally define themselves by their hearing difficulty. There is, however, a segment, or even just individual deaf and hard of hearing persons, who accept the implants if sensible on a case-by-case basis. The author has attempted, given time constraints, to explain the two prevailing models of disability. The convention has its affirmative obligations grounded in a shift from the medical to the social model of disability.42 Arguably, the broad range of affirmative mandates required of states parties in the Convention has the effect of demonstrating its social model nature. The Convention, a human rights instrument with a social development dimension,43 will arguably promote the human rights of people with disabilities.44 This article will next discuss the international framework respecting the human right to healthcare.IV . INTERSECTION OF HEALTHCARE, INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS, AND DISABILITY A set of issues, not always, but increasingly recognized as a human rights issue, is that of disability. There is, consequently, a human rights infrastructure that requires brief discussion. As such, the author will briefly explore that infrastructure, seeking to note that, while robust, it did not always adequately address the issues and concerns of the disabled. The Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000, request signatories to address poverty, and by interconnection, maternal and child health.45 In 2010, at the sixty-fifth session of the General Assembly of the United Nations, the members adopted the third of a series of Resolutions on Global Health and Foreign Policy, which among others, acknowledged the emerging world recognition that universal access to healthcare promotes and protects the right of each person to the highest obtainable level of health.46 Point 13 of the Resolution acknowledges, \"The need to further address the issue of governance for global health as health is increasingly being challenged by new realities of an interdependent world.\"47 Moreover, Points 3, 16, and 18 recognize the leadership of the World Health Organization as the primary agency of the United Nations in international health policy and urge members to link health as an aspect of their overall foreign policy.48 While the Millennium Development Goals have an important role in global health governance, especially with regard to the health of women, they do not have disability-specific targets, metrics, or criteria.49 Namely, there is a human rights infrastructure affecting the quality of life and equality of opportunity of women, including women with disabilities.50 The Preamble to the Constitution of the World Health Organization provides that health is a fundamental freedom of all persons, equaling \"a state of complete physical, mental and social well- being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\"51 Additionally, The Universal Declaration on Human Rights, drafted in the same timeframe as the Constitution of the World Health Organization, provides for women, including what could be argued to be women with disabilities, to be free from all forms of discrimination, based on gender, in accessing their right to healthcare.52 In addition 85 Winter 2013to these hortatory documents, there are a range of international instruments that nations have ratified, affirmatively obligating their governments to certain legal and policy measures. Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights provides that each person, including individuals with disabilities, has the right to the highest level of obtainable physical and mental health.53 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in its General Comment 5 analyzes the obligations of States with respect to equal rights for men and women with disabilities before the law.54 Additional international instruments protecting women and their children are the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.55 In 1998, The United Nations adopted the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and on Human Rights.56 In the Americas, there is a regional focused human rights infrastructure.57 The Inter-American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities (1999) aims to prevent and eliminate all forms of discrimination against persons with mental or physical disabilities.58 Member States, who are within the purview of the Pan American Health Organization, are suppose to \"advocate,\" \"promote,\" \"protect,\" and \"safeguard\" the human rights of certain groups in situations of vulnerability, especially in the context of services provided by their health agencies. Specifically, the relationship between the exercise of human rights and the enjoyment of health of people with physical and mental disabilities should be a priority to Member States. Finally, it is important to recall Resolution CSP26.R19 on the Extension of Social Protection in Health that establishes the mandate to extend social protection (through appropriate funding) in health.59 In addition, there are a range of soft legal instruments or policies that seek to safeguard the rights of the disabled.60 Examples of soft laws are a range of lofty Resolutions and policies passed by the General Assembly at the United Nations, including the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons [sic Intellectually Disabled Persons]61 and the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities.62 These soft laws or policies do not focus attention on disability-specific issues or address disability in a comprehensive way.63 Despite the existence of a human rights infrastructure, disability issues required their own attention. The Convention constitutes the first human rights treaty of the second millennium, comprising what may be a great leap forward for the rights of the disabled in civil society. The Convention is unique among international instruments in that it is applicable to and enforceable on the basis of disability.64 In the next part of this article, the author will concisely discuss the Convention and its Protocol.65 V . THE CONVENTION AND OPTIONAL PROTOCOL Adopted on December 13, 2006, and entered into force on May 3, 2008,66 the text of the Convention is comprised of 25 preamble paragraphs and 50 Articles.67 As of the time the author researched and wrote this article for the conference that occurred in March, 2012,68 108 states parties ratified the Convention and 63 states parties ratified the Optional Protocol.69 Likewise, 153 signatories and 90 signatories were in existence as of the time of the conference.70 The Convention provides a range of affirmative obligations on states parties, ensuring the equal enjoyment of human rights by women or girls with disabilities.71 For example, Article 25 of the Convention provides a requirement that healthcare services be accessible.72 The Convention has a critical role in contributing not only to health and human rights law and their interconnection but also to the democratization of such law and policy for the world' s largest minority population.73 This article will focus on sundry provisions of the Convention that have a connection to the access of women with disabilities in experiencing the highest obtainable level of health.74 A. Women with Disabilities: Articles of the Convention In Article 3, General Principles, the Convention provides that state parties will recognize the equality of men and women.75 The Convention has specific reference to women with disabilities in Article 6, entitled Women with Disabilities; Article 16, entitled Freedom from Exploitation, Violence, and Abuse; and, Article 28, entitled Adequate Standard 86 Health Law & Policy Briefof Living and Social Protection.76 Article 6 of the Convention urges that state parties should undertake proactive and on-going measures ensuring the equal enjoyment by women or girls with disabilities of human rights.77 Additionally, Article 6 of the Convention provides, \"States parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure the full development, advancement and empowerment of women, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of...human rights and fundamental freedoms.\"78 Building on these general principles, many Articles of the Convention have robust text, addressing the full range of rights women enjoy as actors in civil society, including, but not limited to, the human right of healthcare. B. Awareness Raising \u2014 Gender and Disability Stereotyping: Article 8 Article 8 of the Convention provides that states parties will undertake affirmative measures \"to combat stereotypes, prejudices, and harmful practices relating to persons with disabilities, including those based on sex and age, in all areas of life\" throughout society, including especially at the level of the family.79 Article 8 of the Convention provides that measures to this end include, among others, public awareness campaigns promoting greater social acceptance of persons with disabilities, including with respect to their contributions to the workforce. Encouraging positive media images of persons with disabilities is an important measure referenced in this Article.80 In short, awareness raising measures as well as visibility of disabled leaders themselves constitutes critical measures in the advancement of affirmative rights.81 C. Equal Recognition before the Law \u2014 Legal Capacity: Article 12; and Access to Justice, Article 13 A couple of provisions of the Convention have a notable impact on how people with disabilities interact with the legal system, including with respect to protecting their very right to be part of the community. Because people with disabilities have historically been relegated to the shadows on the guise of limiting decision-making and legal capacity, Articles of the Convention, such as Article 12, guaranteeing access to processes by which the disabled might dispute such limitations, are critical. Articles 12 and 13 respectively requiring community integration and access to the justice system are critical to people with disabilities in protecting their \"civil health.\"82 Articles 12 and 25 are related in ensuring healthcare protections of people with disabilities.83 Arguably, Article 25 (Health) has the effect of reinforcing the principles in Article 12 related to the freedom to make decisions about one' s health care. Article 12 of the Convention is representative of \"a paradigm shift\" from substituted decision-making to supported decision-making.84 Equal access to the justice system constitutes a felicitous development, ensuring that women and girls with disabilities will be in the position to enjoy their human rights.85 With Article 13 fortifying Article 12, a strong tool is put in place. According to Article 13 of the Convention,86 people with disabilities have an equal right to effective access to the justice system, whether as an employee, as a party, as a prisoner, or as a victim.87 This is to be achieved through the provision of reasonable accommodations.88 By having an accessible justice system, which recognizes the needs of the disabled, such as for accommodations or for alternative approaches to historical ways of dealing with the disabled in society, namely institutionalization,89 the disabled may have an enhanced role as to fundamental decisions, as best as they are able, about their care, about their community activities, about their supports, and about their living arrangements. D. Respect for Home and the Family \u2014 The Right to Marry and Found a Family: Article 23 Article 23 of the Convention provides that, \"States Parties shall take effective and appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against persons with disabilities in all matters relating to marriage, family, parenthood and relationships, on an equal basis with others....\"90 In addition, Article 23 recognizes that states parties will respect the family planning decision-making and reproductive choices of people with disabilities.9187 Winter 2013E. Freedom from exploitation, violence, and abuse: Article 16 Article 16 of the Convention provides that, \"States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social, educational and other measures to protect persons with disabilities, both within and outside the home, from all forms of exploitation, violence and abuse, including their gender-based aspects.\"92 Furthermore, Article 16 of the Convention provides that States Parties will seek to promulgate, enact, and implement gender-focused legislation, regulations, and policies. On a sublegal level, they are to disseminate information, provide services, and ensure supports to prevent, to foster reporting, and to enhance prosecution of gender-based violence. Article 16 of the Convention also mandates that state parties will, through all appropriate measures, ensure the recovery, rehabilitation, and social reintegration of persons with disabilities through an environment that incorporates and includes gender and age specific needs.93 F. Protecting the Integrity of the Person: Article 17 Article 17 provides that \"[e]very person with disabilities has a right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity on an equal basis with others.\"94 As one Article discussed: \"In the original drafts of this Article, specific mention was made of forced institutionalization and involuntary treatment but these were omitted in the final version due to differences in opinion as to the scope of this right. Arguably, Article 17, when read with the prohibition against torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment in Article 15, provides the basis for understanding forced psychiatric interventions as a violation of human rights.\"95 G. Health: Article 25 Article 25 of the Convention provides, consistent with the human rights framework for health,96 that, \"States Parties recognize that persons with disabilities have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health without discrimination on the basis of disability.\"97 Article 25 of the Convention requires that, \"States Parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure access for persons with disabilities to health services that are gender-sensitive, including health-related rehabilitation.\"98 States parties are to undertake affirmative measures to ensure equal access to health, including, but not limited to, providing equal access to sexual and reproductive health information and programs.99 Article 25 specifies that States Parties must require health professionals to provide care of the same quality to persons with disabilities as to others, including on the basis of free and informed consent.100 In short, this Article of the Convention recognizes the importance of sublegal or sub-judicial approaches to improving the access and quality of healthcare services to the disabled, through many processes, including the proactive training of healthcare providers.101 H. Information Access: Articles of the Convention In international law, the right to healthcare has the effect of encompassing information access that protects against harm, disease complications, and preventable mortality.102 \"[t]he right to health specifically requires that information be accessible to all.\"103 Y et, in the new millennium, when technology is transforming everyday life, modes of communication and information acquisition and dissemination, including, but not limited to, the Internet, are an added barrier to the disabled having equal opportunities for living, learning, and earning. The Convention has the effect of addressing access to information, including through technology and alternative formats. Accessibility is discussed in Article 9 of the Convention. 104 In addition, Article 21 addresses freedom of expression and opinion and access to information.105 Education is discussed in Article 24 of the Convention.106 When interpreted comprehensively, these Articles provide a remarkable right of access to information and technology. Arguably, these Articles may serve as an important impetus for positive advancements in the equality of disabled persons. 1. Community Inclusion and Integration \u2014 Accessibility, Article 9; Adequate Standard of 88 Health Law & Policy BriefLiving and Social Protection, Article 28; Article 19 According to the working group, there is a continued need to insist on the right to community inclusion. Article 9 of the Convention is important in that its language imposes affirmative accessibility mandates. Mandates regarding early-on universal design, and where existing, the removal of physical barriers and communications barriers are present in the Article. Article 28 of the Convention, which provides that \"States Parties recognize the right of persons with disabilities to social protection and to the enjoyment of that right without discrimination on the basis of disability, and shall take appropriate steps to safeguard and promote the realization of this right....\"107 States parties are to, among others things, undertake affirmative measures ensuring that women and girls with disabilities, including older adults, have equal access to social protection and poverty reduction programs.108 Article 19 of the Convention is important in that its language addresses the right of persons with disabilities to reside in the community, rather than, as has been the historical practice, in institutions excluded from the public.109 Under this Article, supports and services must be furnished first in the furtherance of having people with disabilities in the community; and institutionalization is a last resort.110 Taken together, these Articles provide for a strong legal framework to integrate and include the disabled. J. Adequate Standard of Living and Social Protection: Article 28 Article 28 of the Convention provides that, \"States Parties recognize the right of persons with disabilities to social protection and to the enjoyment of that right without discrimination on the basis of disability, and shall take appropriate steps to safeguard and promote the realization of this right....\"111 States parties are, to among others, undertake affirmative measures ensuring that women and girls with disabilities, including older adults, have equal access to social protection and poverty reduction programs.112 K. Enforcement In short, the Convention and its Optional Protocol provide arguably \"robust mechanisms to promote national compliance with and implementation of the obligations\" set forth in the instruments.113 While this article cannot hope to serve as a catalog of the many provisions of the Convention and its Optional Protocol, it is worth noting that these instruments are unique among international human rights instruments in that they have specific and strong provisions and language regarding national level monitoring.114 Articles 31 through 40 provide the monitoring and reporting mechanisms of the instruments imposing affirmative obligations on states parties to actively comply with and implement the affirmative obligations and to involve people with disabilities in such process.115 The Convention has a state reporting mechanism, and reports are submitted to a Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities at the United Nations.116 While not enforceable and often confidential, the Optional Protocol to the Convention provides for additional mechanisms to focus attention on human rights violations of state parties and to encourage state parties to address violations. Namely, it provides for the transmittal of communications and the convening of investigatory inquiries regarding egregious violations.117 The foregoing discussion may be a good source for public officials to consult in seeking to address healthcare inequality. There is a range of barriers encountered by disabled women and girls in accessing healthcare services. The article will subsequently address the kind of barriers confronted by women in enjoying their rights and in obtaining the highest level of healthcare. In the analysis part of the article, the author will then seek to incorporate the recommendations of the working group in terms of how the affirmative mandates of the Convention might be applied to redress the barriers. VI. BARRIERS ENCOUNTERED BY WOMEN WITH DISABILITIES IN ACCESSING HEALTHCARE SERVICES AND SOCIAL SUPPORTS The deprivation of rights to one classification of individuals weakens the human rights of all.118 There is a \"special situation\" of women or girls with disabilities who are disadvantaged not only because of gender, but also because of disability.119 Levels of social position, as well as disadvantage, are divergent among women and men.120 \"While 89 Winter 2013women with disabilities have much in common with men with disabilities, women with disabilities have to face multiple discrimination in many cases, so that they are often more disadvantaged than men with disabilities in many circumstances.\"121 Women with disabilities are likely to be unemployed or underemployed, are likely to be poor, and are likely to be excluded from equal access to an array of services, supports, and systems provided by civil society.122 An array of issues disproportionately and uniquely affects women with disabilities as opposed to men with disabilities.123 A women' s health organization in Australia eloquently wrote in a policy paper about the rights status of women with disabilities in Australia that: \"The denial and infringement of women with disabilities right to health can be seen in an array of human rights violations: they experience violence at higher rates than their non-disabled sisters, experience less control over what happens to their bodies, have less access to vital health care services, such as cervical and breast cancer screening and, face discrimination, societal prejudice and stigma when it comes to determining their reproductive right.\"124 A brief discussion of the barriers encountered by women with disabilities within the healthcare and related social systems will ensue.125 A. Introductory Review of Prejudice, and its Stigmatizing Effect on the Body and Reproductive Choices A full range of sexual feelings, desires, needs and problems are experienced by all people with disabilities.126 Perhaps this is a mind blower to society; people with disabilities are sexually active, reporting as equal sexual desire as the non- disabled.127 People with disabilities, especially women with disabilities, do encounter, however, an array of issues in accessing and enjoying sexual and reproductive health services and opportunities.128 Contained below is the briefest of discussions on disability and sexuality. Civil society often stigmatizes the body of women with disabilities, thereby decreasing positive body images.129 \"The long and shameful history of stigmatization of sexuality, reproduction, and parenting by people with disabilities is well known.\"130 As the following attitudes, notions, or belief systems demonstrate, the bodies of women with disabilities are stigmatized. Only independently functioning women can handle sexual relationships. Disabled women who are single are celibate. Y outh and beauty are essential to sexuality.131 Even if they are in the position for sex, disabled women should be grateful for sexual relationships. Given this illustrative manifest of attitudes about the disabled and their sexuality, that the disabled encounter problems finding potential pro- disability partners should be no source of shock.132 Disability has an impact on a relationship just like any other aspect of human difference. Unlike other types of differences, the attitude of greater society of disability as pathology may prevent a relationship from beginning, or may create conflict within a relationship.133 Once those barriers are overcome, then questions of sexual arousal and gratification may arise.134 This article will discuss the issue of sexual intercourse, then shifting to a focus on procreation and child rearing. The presence of a disability does not preclude sexual activity. However, sexual intercourse may necessitate adaptation to accommodate limited movement, fatigue, pain sensitivity, lack of sensation, or other disability-related factors.135 Women with disabilities need to be just as careful as able-bodied women in preventing sexually transmitted diseases or in informing their decisions about family planning, including birth control.136 The story below describes disability and sexuality. A woman with a spinal injury named Angela Rockford stated that, \"Sexy is not about sensation.\" She recounted the impact of her disability on sexuality, expressing that, \"It took time to recognize that what I was feeling during sex was less about physical sensation and more of a mental build-up. It' s mind over matter, but there' s definitely a release. It was completely frustrating at first, but I think part of the healing process was learning the ways my body works differently after my accident.\"137 Should she find her way to the bedroom or other room, she may encounter additional barriers should she and her partner desire to procreate. The reproductive choices of disabled women are typically discounted.138 \"Whether a woman is 90 Health Law & Policy Briefborn with a disability or acquires it later in life, the message she gets from the medical system and society is that she is ineligible for normal societal female roles as lover, wife, or mother.\"139 A well- entrenched notion holds that women with disabilities are not entitled to or should not be allowed to procreate.140 Pregnancy is an intimate decision for women regardless of disability.141 \"Women with disabilities, however, often are not allowed to make such choices independently.\"142 People often believe that disabled women cannot be mothers and that all disabled women are heterosexual.143 People with disabilities encounter an array of issues with their reproductive health.144 Women and girls with disabilities are perceived as ill, and as such many believe it is in the best interest of the disabled women not to procreate.145 Specifically, women and girls with disabilities are sterilized, violating their human rights.146 One would hope that the type of attitude expressed in the famous domestic case of Buck v. Bell where Associate Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes stated that three generations of imbeciles are enough would be antiquated. Y et, that notion is held by some civil society actors and women with disabilities are still the victims of sterilization. If a disabled woman surmounts these attitudes, then she may encounter physical or programmatic barriers in accessing her healthcare. B. Access to Health Services: Physical and Communications Access Women with disabilities are the subjects of unequal healthcare services, such as gynecological examinations. Specifically, Women with disabilities often encounter physical, attitudinal, and policy barriers in seeking to meet their health care needs.147 Even when a Provider, meaning a party who furnishes healthcare services, is not outright discriminatory, their benign neglect or treatment decisions can have the effect of discrimination.148 A mixture of physical as well as communications barriers will be concisely set forth herein. Unequal access, in a physical sense, is a serious detriment to the overall health and welfare of women with disabilities. Physical barriers may include inaccessible entrances to healthcare facilities as well as inaccessible medical diagnostic equipment, such as weight scales.149 Women with disabilities cannot access diagnostic medical equipment, such as mammography machines.150 In addition to physical or programmatic barriers, the inability or unwillingness of Providers to accommodate sensory impairments may pose barriers.151 The disabled may encounter inaccessible websites when they seek to interact with insurance companies, healthcare service providers, or even the government.152 \"In addition to barriers of physical access, disabled people are often marginalized because they are unable to access information or other material.\"153 In terms of requiring accommodations, such as specialized formatting or design specifications, people with sensory disabilities are notably disadvantaged by these inaccessible platforms.154 As Michael A. Schwartz states, \"[u]p to two million deaf people in the United States use sign language to communicate, but when they need to see a doctor, they find that many medical offices and hospitals are 'aurally inaccessible,' that is, they lack appropriate auxiliary aids for deaf patients.\"155 The complexity of information may also create accessibility problems for people with intellectual disabilities156 Thus, the failure of a Provider to provide auxiliary aids or services necessary to ensure that a woman with a disability is not segregated or otherwise excluded is a violation of the American with Disabilities Act157 and arguably also a human rights violation. Advancements in healthcare technology should provide valuable information to the procreative decision-making of people with disabilities. If a social model of disability shapes the conversation about disability rights, then advancements in healthcare technology should allow for the treatment of conditions of the fetus that may lead to disabilities or at least enable parents to plan for accommodating such disability. The wondrous developments in healthcare technology have the effect of increasingly allowing humans to peer earlier and earlier into the beginnings of life. If parents have the ability to peer into the early stages of life of their child, obtaining information about the possibility of a disability by a pro-disability medical Provider; such parents will be in the position to maximize this information- sharing to plan for and implement community-based supports and services.158 However, bias, prejudice, and discrimination are pervasive.91 Winter 2013People with disabilities have notable health disparities.159 Women with disabilities suffer higher rates of disease and injury, including, but not limited to their sexual and reproductive health.160 As evidence of overall health disparities, sexual and reproductive health will be mentioned, once again. Receiving that annual set of routine examinations, such as a Pap test and breast examination is not always that simple for a disabled woman.161 \"Falsely assuming that women with disabilities are asexual leads health care providers to withhold needed information and services.\"162 Women without disabilities receive mammograms eleven percent more frequently than women with physical disabilities.163 Breast examination are important not only for all women, but in circumstances where a woman' s disability limits her ability to self-monitor her gynecological health.164 Various studies show that women with disabilities suffer higher rates of cancers, including gynecologic cancers because they are not receiving important screenings.165 Given the bias, discrimination, and stereotypes pervasive in the Provider community regarding the asexuality of women with disabilities, sexually transmitted diseases in women with disabilities are less likely to be reported or even detected.166 In addition to their sexual and reproductive health, women with disabilities have notable health disparities as to other health issues, such as maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system and in preventing cardiovascular disease. Heart disease constitutes a leading killer in the United States,167 particularly impacting women. Women with disabilities are less likely to receive screenings for cardiovascular disease.168 As such, it is not difficult to understand that women with disabilities also encounter barriers in ensuring their overall heart health. The couple of stories provided below will attempt to furnish the seriousness of the discrimination experienced by the disabled. Annual examinations, such as pap tests, are the important part of a health regiment. Y et, many women with disabilities have barriers in accessing these important, and even life-saving examinations.169 Just as one example, a 69 year-old woman experienced a stroke, which paralyzed her right arm and leg.170 Before the on-set of her disability, she always received regular physical examinations.171 Given her limitations and the inaccessibility of medical Providers, she wondered how she would access a physical examination, such as climbing onto an exam table for a breast exam.172 The author will briefly discuss how animals sometimes play into health disparities. When a handler of a highly specialized bred and trained guide dog navigates into an array of medical Providers,173, such as a physician office174or a hospital,175 she often receives a similar rebuff. All too often, a Provider will disgorge the shibboleth \"no dogs allowed.\"176 For example, the reception staff refused a woman with a guide dog to visit her son who was to be examined.177 Naturally, the front office staff, specifically the office manager, rebuffed the request for access of the guide dog because of the lack of a written policy on interacting with people with disabilities.178 The office manager claimed to the police that denying access was for the safety and comfort of the woman and of her dog.179 The experience of a Canadian woman, a well- accomplished computer program designer, who is blind and who resides in Ottawa, describes the invidious discrimination still in civil society.180 Donna, an accessibility consultant, could not apply for a position utilizing an on-line jobs site because it was not structured to work with a screen-reader.181 In the experience of this author as a Civil Rights Commissioner, the argument of the Canadian government embroiled in the litigation is, not unlike governments and others in the United States, where some believe that full access to the Internet is a \"special right.\" The Canadian government argued that the website is discretionary and that Donna could access the same information through alternative means, such as via telephone.182 C. Institutionalization Institutionalization still has,183 and has historically had, a detrimental impact on the integration and inclusion of the disabled.184 People who are institutionalized reside in some form of communal housing with various medical supports and services. In these areas, they are the subjects of strict regimentation, where they are unlikely to 92 Health Law & Policy Briefhave strong self-determination, and where they are unlikely to be full participants in their own healthcare.185 The institutionalization of people with all forms of disabilities is an unfortunate mechanism of promoting the stigma in that ostensibly allows civic society to hide people with disabilities out of sight, leading to the diminished social capital, as well as poor health and welfare.186 Notably, people with all forms of disabilities are usually the subjects of deplorable living conditions.187 Institutionalization has been specifically shown to lead to abuse and neglect.188 Thus, institutionalization has the effect of weakening the health status of people with disabilities. D. Violence and Abuse 1. Gender and Disability- Intimate partner Physical Violence Abuse and Violence by a Partner or Famil y A woman with a disability named Tracy, an Executive Director of an Independent Living Center in Ontario, Canada, sustained domestic violence by her abusive and non-disabled husband.189 According to Tracy, she played \"Ms. Executive Director by day\" and her husband beat her at night.190 The domestic violence would cycle through the typical progression of outbreaks and then fawned harmony, worsening when the couple moved to South Africa for the husband' s employment.191 At the eventual criminal trial of the husband, the husband' s defense attorney attempted to justify the abusive relationship, based on Tracy' s disability.192 An interview between Human Rights Watch and a Ugandan woman with a hearing impairment in 2010 found the disturbing prevalence of disability as a justification for domestic violence.193 \"I was hated because I was deaf, even by my parents. My mother used to beat me so much. \" The interviewee expressed that, because of her disability, \"There was a time when another relative pierced me [points to a scar on her leg]\".194 2. Abuse and Violence by Personal Attendants & Care providers People with disabilities, who are particularly from the mobility impaired community, may rely on third persons for additional support in performing daily living tasks, such as bathing. As might be imagined, interacting with and even relying on a third party for personal and intimate tasks may lead to vulnerability and even harm. This article will dispense with a longer discussion, providing an example as evidence without the need for further explanation. Just as one example, a gentleman named Jefferson, a 51 year old insurance adjuster, has cerebral palsy. The severity of his disability required Jefferson to have a personal attendant. His former home health care aide persisted with unwelcome sexual advances, forcing Jefferson to terminate the employment of the person.195 3. Criminal Acts, E.g. Sexual Offenses In Zimbabwe, a young girl with a disability attended a residential academy.196 Her instructor committed rape.197 \"I could not report the matter to any one, as I did not know whom to trust anymore because the school matron had let him rape me. \"198 In 2004, a Canadian woman with a mental health or intellectual disability expressed to her teacher that she and her stepfather played a \"'hugging' game.\"199 The stepfather of the disabled woman would touch her genitals and buttocks.200 In 2005, the disabled woman described the game to police, and when her sexual assault case went to trial, the defendant initially received an acquittal based on the disability of the woman.201 These stories provide a basic understanding that gender-based violence, including, domestic violence, is all too common, occurring throughout the life cycle.202 \"Domestic violence against women with disabilities is disturbingly prevalent.\"203 Women with disabilities have been estimated to be twice as likely to constitute the victims of intimate partner abuse as women without disabilities.204 Gender-based violence may occur in myriad forms, and it may include, but not be limited to, sex-selective abortion or selective abortion, battery during pregnancy, physical and psychological violence within intimate relationships, and genital mutilation.205 Abusers may uniquely target the specific disability of the woman.206 Violence may, whether perpetrated by a spouse, a family member, or a personal care attendant, have several forms, such as physical violence, or even killing a pet.207 For instance, an abuser might intentionally harm an assistance dog of a woman 93 Winter 2013with a disability or disable her assistive devices.208 Again, violence against people with disabilities may be psychological or emotional in nature. There may be glares in a crowded establishment that a sighted spouse would be married to a blind spouse and his furry partner. Sometimes disabled persons, including those who are emerging leaders in disability rights are exposed to criticism for marrying a non-disabled person, regardless of how supportive and disability friendly the non-disabled spouse may be. Alternatively, people with disabilities are, in the view of some, justified as the victims of violence because they are not whole people.209 Because of these factors, women with disabilities are likely to constitute the victims of violence, and because they are historically excluded from equal access to information and services, they are unlikely to recover. Additionally, women with disabilities are often excluded from domestic violence prevention information and programs, post-violence habitation, and rehabilitation.210 E. End-of-life Issues \"I hate the men who would prolong their lives by foods and drinks and charms of magic art perverting nature' s course to keep off death ...when they no longer serve the land to quit this life, and clear the way for youth.\"211 As the population in each nation ages, public policymakers will continuously confront end-of-life issues. The higher acuity of services posed by older adults at the end-of-life and its influence on healthcare rationing is among the range of issues they must confront in formulating public policy.212 The disability rights community argues that rationing will only result in the modern day gatekeepers of The Tree of Knowledge \u2014 -where a physician selects who is deemed to be worthy of life.213 Masked as procedures, services, and therapies intended to alleviate suffering and humanely hasten death, such healthcare, scientific, and technological developments, such as Physician Assisted Death,214 have been argued to be expressions of the dream of the eugenicist realized at the end-of-life. Providers are likely to engage in rationing, i.e. selecting, based on prejudice about life with a disability, healthier individuals over the disabled.215 In other words, Providers ostensibly utilize their storied status to differentiate between the strong and the weak, with the disabled receiving the negative brunt of science and technology.216 Arguably, practices such as Physician Assisted Death rarely constitute a free decision of the disabled, especially the intellectually disabled.217 As such, people with disabilities of any age, who have a terminal condition, may morph into unintended victims of health care rationing due to larger prejudices of society.218 Thus, people with and without disabilities should be cautious, but should not, at the same time, reflexively condemn options. Developments in healthcare, science, and technology can, if not counterbalanced by bioethical and legal safeguards, outstrip the spiritual power of each human, leading to a nightmare-like society.219 In profit driven healthcare systems, to be specific, minority populations for which there are noted disparities are likely to receive the negative impact of healthcare rationing or scientific and technological developments, or both.220 \"There is a long and regrettable history of scientific discrimination against people with disabilities....\"221 Conversely, when there is properly diagnosed terminal condition it is imprudent to dismiss the ability of any individual with or without disabilities to participate in end-of-life planning, decision-making, and choices, even if that means ending life.222 VII. CONCLUSION The global community is presently poised at an epoch in history in which tangible improvements in the rights status of people with disabilities can be achieved. Innovations in healthcare service delivery, or science and technology, such as personalized medicine,223 various forms of genetic screening and testing,224 and concierge medicine,225 have the potential of providing benefits to or diminishing the rights of people with disabilities. No one in civil society should be arguably disadvantaged by barriers that prevent them from accessing services available to without limitations.226 Should healthcare science and technology outstrip human spirituality,227 uniqueness, and individuality, then individuals with or without disabilities will denigrate to the level of the widget. Thus, an important centurion against the sinister forces of civic society that have been historically expressed through a range of means, including healthcare, 94 Health Law & Policy Briefscience, and technology, is the law. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is an important component of that legal framework. This article, initially utilized at a conference in March, 2012, attempted to describe some of the barriers and also an international human rights development that might catalyze its redress, the Convention.228 \"In an age of pervasive eugenics, where the inherent dignity of every human being and the objectivity of ethics is [sometimes legitimately] doubted,\"229 the experience of people with disabilities within the healthcare system results in frustration at best and discrimination at worst.230 Notable barriers related to health as well as social supports and services, such as equally accessing physical brick-and-mortar facilities, compounds their exclusion.231 232 As this article has attempted to show, there is arguably a gap between the law and its day-to-day implementation, development, and compliance.233 While a need for affirmative panoply proactively formulated and actively enforced is certainly important, often the law is the mere work product of a legislator if acculturation to the standards, norms, and morals it should reflect, is flagging.234 \"Factors that can influence attitudes in relation to belief or behavior toward disabled people [sic] are a fundamental issue, as the improvement of attitudes toward this group in society must remain high on the agenda of social policy if disabled people are to be full members of society.\"235 As such, conferences, such as the parties herein hosted, constitute an innovative tool or approach for bringing diverse individuals together to discuss and perhaps formulate solutions to vexing public policy challenges. This article would be remiss without mentioning the United States and its role with regard to the Convention. The Convention discussed in this article will only apply to the United States if its Senate ratifies the instruments.236 In summer, 2012, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States Senate favorably reported ratification of the instruments.237 The authors do understand that the Senate Majority Leader, as of the time of editing this article, Harry Reed of Nevada, has indicated he will bring the issue to the floor should there be the votes.238 If the United States ratifies the Convention, then the Convention and the monitoring mechanisms attached to the Convention will ensure the United States is accountable.239 Disability is in part a result of societal normative frameworks,240 historically subjecting such persons to an inadequate social status. Society should, in accordance with the social model of disability, aim toward eliminating the practices that create health disparities.241 There is, building on the law, a need for an array of mechanisms and approaches to acculturating Providers to the rights of this minority population. 1 L.L.M. with Certificates in Administrative and Healthcare Law, American University, Washington College of Law, May 2011; J.D.

As a disabled person, and as a Civil Rights Commissioner in Maryland, the author has a strong interest in resolving the inaccessibility of the healthcare system. The author is also the Co-founder, Vice President, and Corporate Secretary of the Mid-Atlantic Lyceum. Views expressed in this article do not represent the views of any organization with which the author is employed, engaged, or associated \u2014 now and in the past. Specifically, this article does not represent the views, opinions, or policies of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The author acted on his own time, and did not act as an agent, representative, or spokesperson in writing this article. Simply, these are the sole opinions of the author. This article would not be possible without the assistance of notable leaders with disabilities who have gone before this instant author and who also helped in some manner to advance this article towards its publication. For instance, thanks are owing to Janet E. Lord, Esq. and Stephanie Ortoleva, Esq. Moreover, any note of thanks would be inadequate if not targeted at the favorite of all women of this author, his wife, Laura N. Norman, L.C.S.W .-C. She is to this author in terms of affection and appreciation like that of First Lady Abigail Adams to President John Adams. This author is grateful for her understanding of the many hours each of his projects demands on their time together. 2 In the Republic , Plato recounted the words of his instructor, Socrates; words that still have relevant meaning in an age of iPhones. The didactic conversation contained in that opus stated, \"Y ou know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work, especially in the case of a young and tender thing; for that is the time at which the character is being formed....\" See the Republic , http:// classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.3.ii.html (last visited July 30, 2012). This instruction, while discussing arguably children and their roles as future philosopher kings, also has relevance to any endeavor, including the current publication. Id. 3 See Nassozi Kiyaga, People with Disabilities Need HIV Messages , neW visiOn, Feb. 19, 2008). 4 Where applicable, this opus may discuss affirmative measures that Maryland could undertake; however, its applicability is obviously not limited to Maryland. Measures discussed in this opus could be undertaken, and 95 Winter 2013are encouraged to be undertaken, by any local, or province, or state jurisdiction; or nation; or compact of nations. The instant author constitutes an emerging public official in Maryland. Serving on the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights, the instant author hopes that Maryland will undertake affirmative legal, legislative and policy measures to improve healthcare access of the disabled. One such approach this author supports is a multiple stakeholder engagement process. See, e.g., Debra T. Berube & Gary C. Norman, Improving Healthcare Accessibility for People with Disabilities: A Call to Maryland' s Leaders, 45 md. b. J. 12 (Mar.-Apr. 2012). 5 The reader should be advised that this article may utilize people with disabilities or \"disabled\" as a modifier. As a person with a disability, the author utilizes any such word with the best of intentions, namely from a pro human and civil rights bent. That being stated, the author realizes that some individuals may have sensitivity or even hypersensitivity about word usage. 6 This author initially drafted this article as a \"working paper\" for a conference on global health, gender and human rights hosted by American University, Washington College of Law in conjunction with the Pan American Health Organization. At the conference, attendees divided into working groups, developed recommendations, and reported on those recommendations at the closing session. 7 Statistics, Women in Development , USAID, http:// transition.usaid.gov/our_work/cross-cutting_programs/wid/ gender/wwd_statistics.html (last updated Nov. 09, 2010). 8 See World Facts and Statistics on Disabilities and Disability Issues , disabled -WORld , http://www.disabled- world.com/disability/statistics/ (last visited Oct. 4, 2012) (estimate by the World Bank). 9 Id. 10 Javier Vasquez & Armando Vasquez, Human Rights and Health: Persons with Disabilities , Pan ameRican HealtH ORganizatiOn , 2008, at 1, available at www.paho.org/ english/dd/pub/10069_Disabilities.pdf. 11 In other words, one out of every five Americans has a disability.

As the goal for this particular article is, and was always a basic introduction of the topic of gender and global health and their interconnection with disability, any such discussion has to be circumspect in nature.

The terminally ill and disabled may be viewed as financial and emotional burdens by health care institutions and their own families. As such, the mere existence of the right to terminate treatment tips the scales toward choosing death for the disabled and terminally ill. 220 See, e.g. , Leslie Pickering Francis, (Mis)Framing Schiavo as Discrimination against People with Disabilities in Symposium, The Schiavo Case: Interdisciplinary Perspectives , 61 u. m iami l.

Tests exist for genetic factors associated with more than 400 human conditions ranging from ones (like Tay Sachs) that are 101 Winter 2013universally acknowledged as severely disabling to others that many people dismiss as insignificant afflictions. These tests are typically used in three basic situations. Predictive gene testing involves testing at-risk individuals for certain disabilities that may manifest themselves later in life, such as Huntington' s disease and breast or colorectal cancer. Carrier testing involves testing at-risk prospective parents for disabling recessive genes, such as the testing of Ashkenazi Jews for Tay-Sachs disease and Mediterranean peoples for Beta Thalassemia. Prenatal testing involves testing at-risk fetuses for disabilities (such as cystic fibrosis) that run in their families or ethnic groups. In time, the number of identifiable disabling genes and the ease of testing for them may so increase that widespread screening of individuals, populations, and fetuses may become the norm.\"). 225 See Pauline W .

These recommendations have been suggested by the Working Group on Disabilities and Mental Health that convened on March 21 and 22, 2012 at the Inaugural Conference on Global Health, Gender and Human Rights, which was organized by the American University Washington College of Law and PAHO/WHO. These recommendations do not necessarily reflect the views of the author(s) of the preceding article. The recommendations are divided by the following set of questions based on principles extracted from the PAHO Resolution \"Health and Human Rights\" (CD 50 R.8): Taking into account the national context, financial and legal framework and budgetary constraints of countries : a. Which areas require special attention from government agencies? Strengthen the technical capacity of the health authority to work with the corresponding governmental human rights entities to evaluate and oversee the implementation of the applicable international human rights instruments to protect persons with disabilities; Improve the capacity and mechanisms of ministries of health and health services to include a human rights norms and standards into their policies, plans and services; Strengthen the technical capacity of health care workers, authorities and stakeholders to understand and implement the applicable legislation and international human rights instruments to protect women with disabilities. (Consider the possibility of including people with disabilities as trainers); Improve coordination and articulation between the different ministries and gender and disabilities areas; Create a gender office and/or focal point in the Ministry of Health; Mainstream human rights of women with disabilities in all policies and plans of the different ministries, including ministries of Economy and the design and implementation of the budget; Create gender-based monitoring mechanisms to prevent violence and abuse against women with disabilities; Establish gender based mechanisms to implement the CRPD' s supported decision- making mandate in article 12; Improve data collection about people with disabilities disaggregate by sex to give attention to the size and scope of the problem; Create services and protections in the community to ensure people are not segregated from society within their own homes and by their own family; and Establish mechanisms to protect private patients' information and provide access to their own information (medical files, etc.). b. What key factors should be identified and included by health authorities and other governmental actors when formulating national health policies and plans consistent with the applicable international human rights instruments that protect persons with disabilities, in particular women' s with disabilities rights to physical and mental health and other related human rights as enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons 103 Winter 2013with Disabilities (CRPD) and the Inter- American Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Persons with Disabilities? Ensure participation of women with disabilities and their organizations in the design, implementation and monitoring of national health policies and plans; Distribute and elaborate upon educational materials about the rights of women with disabilities; National health policies should take into account the different kinds of disabilities and also the diverse needs of girls and women; Identify and elaborate on a procedure to obtain informed consent and to verify it has been obtained; and Identify technology available in a particular country to help guarantee autonomy and to access information. c. Which key provisions should be included by legislators and other actors when reviewing and reforming national health legislation, incorporating the international human rights instruments especially those protecting persons with disabilities? In general, CRPD should be translated into domestic legislation taking into account the different legal systems; Right to health and access to health care; Right to freedom of movement and mobility; Right to live in the community; Right to be free from discrimination and to have access and participate in all aspects of society, including culture, entertainment, political participation, etc.; Reproductive rights (Art 25 CRPD) should be explicitly recognized in the legislation; Right to determination of legal capacity (Art 12 CRPD); Right to be supported in parenting and rais - ing a family; Right to information; Right to the protection of private data; and Right to be protected from forced sterilization. d. What measures should governments take to ensure the effective implementation of national health policies, plans and laws that protect persons with disabilities? Ensure training to health personnel (GPs, nurses, etc) on international human rights standards and principles applicable to people with disabilities; Ensure training of people with disabilities and their organizations about their rights; Include people with disabilities in trainings (not just as facilitators); Revise existing curricula in universities to include rights of people with disabilities; and Make modules (user friendly and efficient) available on human rights instruments protecting human rights of people with disabilities. e. Parliaments and domestic courts play a key role in promoting and protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons with disabilities. What concrete functions and contributions can those institutions make? Formulate and, if possible, adopt legislative, administrative, educational, and other measures to disseminate the applicable international human rights instruments on protecting the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and other related human rights among the appropriate personnel in the legislative and judicial branches and other governmental authorities; Elaborate handbooks for judges with specific indications on procedures to deal with specific disability-related cases; and Legislation should be critically revised according to international human rights instruments, including procedural aspects. f. What measures could be taken by all those members of society at large who are involved 104 Health Law & Policy Briefin protecting the human rights of persons with disabilities? Promote the dissemination of information and knowledge among civil society organizations at large and other social actors on the applicable international human rights instruments related to health, to address stigmatization; discrimination, and exclusion of persons with disabilities; Promote the inclusion of women with disabilities rights into the agenda of women organization; Promote peer-support programs; Promote the exchange of knowledge and sharing of best-practices (e.g. exchange with other countries, experiences with stronger roles of civil society groups); and Promote and facilitate the establishment of national patients' associations. Taking into account the important role of international organizations, civil society and academic institutions on the promotion and protection of the right to health and other related human rights of persons with disabilities: a. What measures could be taken by PAHO and technical teams of Washington College of Law and other universities to strengthen technical cooperation with the human rights committees, organs and rapporteurships of the United Nations and Inter-American systems (such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights) in order to promote and protect the right to health and other related human rights of persons with disabilities? PAHO should play a role in assessment and review of governmental regulations and legislation; Formulation of technical opinions on health; Participation in thematic hearings; Visits to health centers and other institutions in countries; and Disseminate information about the use of Optional protocols of CRPD, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). b. How could PAHO and other international agencies promote and stimulate collaboration and research with academic institutions, the private sector, civil society organizations and other social actors, when appropriate, to promote and protect human rights in keeping with the international human rights instruments that protect persons with disabilities? Coordinate joint initiatives in order to set up a network for global, regional and national action. c. How could PAHO and other international agencies, governments and academic institutions and civil society promote the sharing of good practices and successful experiences among countries so as to prevent stigmatization, discrimination and exclusion of persons with disabilities? Design a website to disseminate information about the rights of people with disabilities and about best practices, legislative efforts, and other strategies for promoting those rights.105 Winter 2013TOBaccO cOnTRO l FOR WOmEn: a h uman RighTs FRamEWOR k Natassia M. Rozario I. INTRODUCTION As the single most important risk factor for premature death and chronic disease in the world,1 tobacco poses a grave threat to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health. Tobacco use claims about 5 million lives each year, and secondhand smoke (SHS) kills about 600,000 each year.2 Tobacco is more fatal than tuberculosis, HIV/ AIDS, and malaria put together.3 It is projected that by 2030, tobacco will kill more than 8 million people globally each year; 80 percent of these deaths are expected to occur in low-to-middle income countries.4 Absent sufficient action, tobacco use could kill more than a billion people over the course of the twenty-first century.5 This report delineates the multi-dimensional relationship between tobacco control, human rights, and women, with a particular emphasis on the wide- reaching impacts of tobacco use, exposure to SHS, and tobacco production upon the right to health and women' s rights. Although men constitute a majority of the world' s smokers and carry the heaviest burden of smoking-related health consequences, tobacco use is increasing among women.6 Since the 1920s, the tobacco industry has aggressively targeted girls and women.7 In 2004, 1.5 million women died as the result of tobacco use.8 Barring significant intervention, this number will only increase. The World Health Organization (WHO) projects that tobacco-related female deaths will increase to 2.5 million in 2030, 75 percent of which will happen in low-to- middle income countries.9 SHS also has a disproportionate effect upon women and children, particularly in developing countries where the majority of smokers are men.10 Furthermore, evidence suggests that female tobacco farmers may suffer particularly deleterious health consequences related to prolonged exposure to tobacco leaves and pesticides.11 To prevent the tobacco epidemic from further spreading among women, it is imperative that current tobacco control efforts include a gender perspective that does not narrowly focus on pregnancy, reproduction, and smoking, but rather encompasses the myriad issues related to women' s health, socioeconomic conditions, and tobacco use.12 The relationship between tobacco control policy and human rights is multi-dimensional.13 A human rights framework will contribute greatly to current tobacco control efforts in various ways, including ensuring that tobacco control policies are gender sensitive and attentive to the needs of women.14 Additionally, a human rights framework can defend tobacco control policies from industry attack in domestic courts, actively promote stronger tobacco control at the national level, strengthen monitoring mechanisms, and encourage public participation.15 This report will provide background on tobacco use, SHS, and tobacco production. It will then discuss existing tobacco control policies, focusing mainly on * Natassia Rozario is currently a Fulbright Research Fellow in India.

II. TOBACCO USE This section discusses the stages of the tobacco epidemic to illustrate the historical use of tobacco and regional variations. It also delineates the different patterns in tobacco use among different populations. Most of the data used in this section focuses on cigarette use, but it is important to note that in many parts of the world, other forms of tobacco are consumed, including bidis (hand-rolled cigarettes), water-pipe (e.g., hookah, shisha, or narghile), and snuff (oral smokeless tobacco).16 A. Stages of Tobacco Use An influential epidemiological study offers a descriptive model of the cigarette epidemic, suggesting that it occurs in four different stages.17 Stage I signifies the beginning of the tobacco epidemic in a population and is characterized by low smoking prevalence among men and women.18 During Stage I, smoking becomes more socially acceptable and tobacco control strategies lag behind increasing prevalence.19 This first stage usually lasts one to two decades.20 Many developing countries, mainly those in sub-Saharan Africa, are currently in this stage.21 Stage II is marked by a sharp increase in male smokers and an initial increase in female smokers.22 It usually lasts two to three decades.23 Tobacco control efforts continue to remain weak during this phase.24 Countries such as China, Japan, and some countries in Latin America are currently in this stage.25 Stage III can span up to three decades.26 During the beginning of Stage III, male prevalence begins to decline.27 Towards the end of Stage III, female prevalence begins to decline and then plateaus.28 Many countries in Eastern and Southern Europe are currently in this stage.29 Finally, during Stage IV , female and male smoking prevalence continue to decline.30 Countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom are in this final stage. 31 B. Disparities in Tobacco Use In today' s world, tobacco use is greatest among men, especially those who live in poorer countries.32 As of 2006, 40 percent of the world' s male population smoke (32 percent in high income countries, 45 percent in middle income countries, and 28 percent in low income countries).33 In contrast, 9 percent of women smoke in the world today (18 percent in high income countries, 7 percent in middle income countries, and 4 percent in low income countries).34 Although men constitute a majority of the world' s smokers, evidence highlights that smoking prevalence among women is increasing.35 The most cogent evidence of the narrowing gender gap can be seen among adolescents. Data from the Global Y outh Tobacco Survey, which surveyed students aged 13-15 in over 165 countries, demonstrate similar prevalence in cigarette smoking between boys and girls in 58 percent of countries.36 Girls had a higher prevalence of cigarette use than boys in 3 percent of countries.37 Tobacco use is positively correlated with low socioeconomic status.38 Tobacco use is greater in low- to-middle income countries than in higher income countries.39 Within a country, lower socioeconomic groups tend to experience higher rates of tobacco use than their more socioeconomically advantaged counterparts.40 In developed countries, tobacco use has decreased by nearly 50 percent over the past forty years.41 On the other hand, the developing world has experienced a rise in tobacco use.42 In 2005, developing countries consumed 70 percent of cigarettes in the world.43 The risk of tobacco initiation is greater for adolescents and young adults than older populations.44 In the United States, the majority of smokers begin smoking before they turn 18,45 and it is estimated that every day, approximately 4,000 adolescents light their first cigarette.46 In most of the world, people rarely start smoking after the age of 21;47 however, in a few countries such as China, tobacco use is low in adolescence and increases during young adulthood. 48 C. Influences on Tobacco Use Tobacco use is influenced by personal and social factors, which can vary over time and can have varied impacts across different subpopulations.49 Personal factors encompass knowledge about the health hazards of smoking, attitudes towards smoking, self-esteem, and personal image.50 Social 107 Winter 2013factors consist of parental pressure, peer tobacco use, and tobacco marketing.51 Advertising plays a salient role in influencing the initiation of tobacco use.52 Tobacco companies deny marketing cigarettes to young people, but they reap enormous profits from this demographic.53 One study estimated that in 2002, tobacco companies sold 541 million packs of cigarettes to Americans under 18 years of age and made 1.2 billion dollars in revenue.54 Another important study, a 2008 meta-analysis, combining the research of several studies conducted in the both developed and developing countries, found a causal relationship between tobacco advertising and the initiation and heightening of tobacco use.55 With respect to women, studies have identified an especially strong linkage between advertising and the initiation of smoking.56 Since the 1920s, tobacco companies have targeted women by associating smoking with desirable body image, fashion, and independence and freedom. 57 D. Health Effects of Tobacco Use Tobacco use claims about 5 million lives annually. 58 By 2030, it is estimated to kill more than 8 million people globally each year; 80 percent of these deaths to occur in low-to-middle income countries.59 Tobacco use is associated with an increased rate of cardiovascular death (e.g., coronary heart disease, narrowing blood vessels, peripheral vascular disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysms), respiratory disease (e.g., emphysema, bronchitis, and chronic airway obstruction), and cancers (e.g., lung, bladder, cervix, esophagus, kidney, oral cavity, pancreas, pharynx, stomach, and acute myeloid leukemia).60 Tobacco use ultimately has a destructive effect on every part of the body.61 The inimical health consequences of tobacco use upon a women' s health are particularly concerning.62 Although men currently bear a heavier burden of adverse consequence related to smoking, absent any public health action, women will experience greater untoward effects of tobacco use as the gender gap in smoking prevalence narrows with time.63 It is difficult to estimate the full magnitude of tobacco use on women' s health, as the data on women, especially from the developing world, is lacking.64 Most of the epidemiological statistics on the health consequences of smoking on women come from developed countries.65 The extant data, however, illustrates that tobacco has adverse effects upon nearly every aspect of women' s health.66 Smoking threatens reproductive health and menstrual function.67 Smoking increases the risk of painful and irregular menstruation, and increases the likelihood of early menopause and more severe and frequent menopausal symptoms.68 It also heightens the risks of infertility and delays in conceiving.69 Smoking during pregnancy increases the risks of complications during pregnancy and labor, and also imposes serious health risks upon the fetus.70 Compared to infants born to non-smoking mothers, infants of mothers who smoke during pregnancy have lower birth weight (by 200g to 250g, on average), are more likely to have below average weight and height for gestational age, and are at higher risk for stillbirth, neonatal death, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).71 Mothers who smoke are less likely to breastfeed and have shorter breastfeeding duration than mothers who do not smoke.72 The nexus between smoking and poor mental health is worthy of special attention for women. Depressed smokers are more likely to be nicotine dependent, and less likely to quit smoking.73 Twice as many women suffer from depression than men, and women may be more likely to smoke in response to stress, depression, or the desire to control weight.74 Taken together, these statistics underscore that the association between smoking and depression may be particularly important for women. III. SECONDHAND SMOKE Secondhand smoke (SHS) is defined as \"the smoke from the end of a burning cigarette or other tobacco product (sidestream smoke), and the smoke exhaled by the smoker (mainstream smoke).\"75 SHS has thousands of chemicals, 250 of which are toxic or carcinogenic.76 It is difficult to determine the worldwide prevalence of SHS exposure because only a few countries systematically collect data.77 From the surveys conducted, however, it appears that exposure to SHS is highly prevalent.78 Nearly 50 percent of the children surveyed from industrialized countries are exposed to SHS, mainly in the home.79 108 Health Law & Policy BriefThe workplace also appears to be a common site for exposure among adults.80 SHS has devastating impacts upon the health. According to the United States Surgeon General, \"there is no safe amount of secondhand smoke. Breathing even a little secondhand smoke can be dangerous.\"81 The California Environmental Protection Agency (Cal EPA) analyzed over twenty years of data and found that SHS is a major contributor to disease in both adults and children.82 In adults, SHS leads to cancer of the lungs and oral/ nasal cavity, causes heart disease and heart attacks, and exacerbates asthma.83 In children, SHS has been linked to acute respiratory diseases (e.g., bronchitis and pneumonia), asthma, middle ear infections, and reduced lung function.84 SHS is particularly destructive to women' s health. In 2004, 64 percent of SHS-related deaths were among women.85 Exposure to SHS also increases risk of breast cancer among nonsmoking pre-menopausal women.86 Women are especially vulnerable to SHS if they share a home with a smoker and stay at home a majority of the time.87 In most areas of the world where men constitute the majority of smokers, women may be disproportionately affected by SHS.88 In addition to adverse health consequences, SHS has profound effects on a person' s social wellbeing.89 SHS may exclude a person from certain social settings, especially if SHS aggravates her asthma or other respiratory problems.90 In this regard, SHS is particularly harmful when exposure is inescapable, such as in workplaces and in home environments.91 The social dynamics of SHS exposure may also be especially problematic for women and children in situations where gender inequities impede women' s efforts to advocate for smoke-free environments, including in their own homes.92 IV . TOBACCO PRODUCTION Approximately 33 million people are involved in tobacco farming globally.93 Tobacco is grown in more than one hundred countries around the world.94 The six largest tobacco producers account for 66 percent of worldwide tobacco production. They include China (35 percent of worldwide production), Brazil (13 percent), India (10 percent), USA (6 percent), Malawi (2 percent), and Indonesia (2 percent).95 Tobacco production results in adverse health consequences among agricultural workers.96 Many tobacco farmers suffer from acute nicotine poisoning, also known as green tobacco sickness (GTS), which is \"a disease characterized by vomiting or nausea and dizziness or headache during or after exposure to the agent Nicotiana tabacum in tobacco leaves.\"97 GTS may also result in severe conditions such as dehydration requiring emergency medical treatment.98 In addition to GTS, the pesticides that farm workers encounter on tobacco farms have been associated with skin and eye irritation, respiratory problems, and nervous system disorders, as well as kidney impairment.99 Female tobacco farmers, especially in the developing world, encounter occupational health hazards that jeopardize their right to health.100 Pregnant women with chronic exposure to tobacco during harvest may be at a higher risk of preterm delivery and stillbirth.101 Furthermore, a recent study in Vietnam suggests that women may carry a higher burden of the occupational health risks associated with tobacco farming because they spend more time than men on tobacco farming related activities.102 In addition to these adverse health consequences, tobacco farming also places women in the developing world in an economically compromised position and increases their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS.103 In some regions of South Africa, women tobacco farmers work on family plots and constitute half of the tobacco workforce.104 Because of traditional gender roles, women tobacco farmers have little leverage in negotiating with tobacco companies.105 Men, rather than women, own the land for cash crops, and consequently tobacco companies contract with men rather than women.106 Women also rarely get paid for tobacco farming.107 These circumstances place women in economically vulnerable positions.108 Tobacco farming also increases their vulnerability to sexually transmitted diseases.109 One study found that rates of HIV/AIDS have risen in tobacco producing areas in Kenya \u2014 mainly as the result of landless women being sexually exploited by men who provide them with access to land on tobacco farms, and because of an increase in male migrant laborers who have posed a threat to women in these areas.110109 Winter 2013In the developing world, making and selling tobacco products also expose women to health risks and compromise their well-being.111 In Malawi and Ghana, making and selling tobacco products is a common informal sector activity.112 Women tobacco workers in these sectors suffer from low and volatile pay, no employment or social security benefits, poor access to collective bargaining structures, and high exposure to health risks.113 Additionally, many lack legal status, which adds yet another layer of vulnerability.114 V . TOBACCO CONTROL Tobacco control efforts have been aimed at reducing tobacco consumption, exposure to SHS, and the health hazards related to tobacco production. The most important global instrument for tobacco control is the WHO Framework Convention for Tobacco Control (FCTC).115 Ratified by more than 174 countries and covering approximately 87 percent of the global population, the FCTC is a legally binding treaty that mandates state parties to align their national legislation with the contents of the convention.116 The goal of the FCTC is \"to protect present and future generations from the devastating health, social, environmental and economic consequences of tobacco consumption and the exposure to tobacco smoke.\"117 The FCTC addresses supply issues as well as demand reduction strategies.118 Supply-focused strategies include controlling illicit trade in tobacco products and sales to and by minors, as well as measures aimed at transitioning to economically viable alternatives to tobacco farming and production.119 Demand reduction strategies include price, non-price, and tax measures; the establishment of smoke-free environments; and tobacco cessation programs.120 Additional regulation of the contents of tobacco products, product disclosures, packaging and labeling, and advertising, promotion and sponsorship may also reduce demand.121Although the FCTC is a legally binding treaty, it is unclear whether domestic courts can directly enforce its provisions.122 The FCTC lacks both mechanisms for formal monitoring and formal participation by civil society groups in FCTC implementation at the domestic level.123VI. WHAT A HUMAN RIGHTS FRAMEWORK MAY CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT TOBACCO CONTROL EFFORTS A human rights framework may work synergistically with current tobacco control efforts to reduce tobacco consumption and the related health hazards.124 Human rights can be powerful tools not only in defending tobacco control laws, but also in positively promoting tobacco control at the domestic level, offering mechanisms for monitoring the implementation of the FCTC, and encouraging civic engagement.125 Many human rights can be enforced in domestic courts.126 UN treaty-based bodies, charged with overseeing the protection and realization of human rights articulated in their treaties, implement formal mechanisms to monitor the implementation of UN treaties and also have avenues for civil society to inform the process, mainly through the submission of shadow reports.127 These implementation and enforcement mechanisms might be used effectively to support tobacco control policies.128 A. The Human Rights Implicated in the Tobacco Epidemic The Right to Health : The right to health is a fundamental human right, legally enshrined in international, regional, and national human rights instruments.129 The right to health was first articulated in Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.130Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) is the most comprehensive articulation of the right.131 The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESR) analyzed the content of the right to health in General Comment 14, which clearly defines the freedoms and entitlements that come under the right to health, as well as State obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill the right to health.132 According to General Comment 14, the right to health includes not only the right to healthcare, but is also applicable to the social determinants of health and is dependent upon and closely related to many of the other human rights mentioned in this section.133 Article 12 of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) further articulates a woman' s right to health.134110 Health Law & Policy BriefThe Right to Life : The right to life was recognized as fundamental in the Universal Declaration in 1948.135 It also has been guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and numerous regional human rights instruments.136 As Robin Appleberry posits: Although typically the right is invoked to object to arbitrary killings, state executions, or other more direct deprivation of life, the right applies with equal force to the case of tobacco, where state policy, through both its acts and its omissions, fails to protect against a known killer. The crux of this violation lies in the fact that tobacco-related disease is one hundred percent preventable.... [T] obacco is currently the leading cause of premature death in the United States and in several other countries. Faced with the lethality of tobacco products, states have an obligation to combat the threat.137 The Right to Freedom from Discrimination: All human rights instruments implicitly protect the principle of nondiscrimination.138 The ICCPR,139 UDHR,140 and CEDAW expressly articulate the right to freedom from discrimination.141 The FCTC guiding principles stress the importance of non- discrimination and place emphasis on vulnerable groups, highlighting \"the need to take measures to protect all persons from exposure to tobacco smoke\";142 \"the need to take measures to promote the participation of indigenous individuals and communities in the development, implementation and evaluation of tobacco control programmes that are socially and culturally appropriate to their needs and perspectives\";143 and \"the need to take measures to address gender-specific risks when developing tobacco control strategies.\"144 The Right to Seek and Receive Information : This right is established in Article 19 of the UDHR and Article 19 of the ICCPR.145 These provisions pertain to any state action that controls the flow of information and protect the right of each individual to \"seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers.\"146 Accurate information about the hazards of tobacco use is essential to tobacco control.147 Tobacco companies have manipulated information by minimizing the health hazards associated with tobacco use, engaging in misleading packaging and labeling practices, and purposefully targeting adolescents, children, and women.148 Several sections of the FCTC protect the right to access to information.149 Article 10 requires states to \"adopt and implement effective measures for the public disclosure of information about the toxic constituents of the tobacco products and the emissions that they may produce.\"150 Article 11 mandates that states adopt regulations ensuring that \"tobacco product packaging and labeling do not promote a tobacco product by any means that are false, misleading, deceptive, or likely to create an erroneous impression about its characteristics, health effects, hazards or emissions.\"151 Article 12 calls for broad access to education and public awareness programs on the health risks to tobacco smoke.152 The Right to Participation : Article 25 of the ICCPR provides that every citizen shall have the right \"to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives.\"153 This right is also guaranteed under Article 7 of CEDAW .154 Because tobacco policy is a matter of significant political importance, it falls within the definition of public affairs.155 When a state excludes women from participating in such activities, it violates a woman' s basic right to participate in public affairs.156 The Right to Education : Article 26 of the UDHR guarantees to every person \"elementary and other fundamental stages of education.\"157 This right is also affirmed in the ICESCR (Article 13), and CEDAW (Article 10).158 Poor access to education, especially for women of low socioeconomic status, poses an enormous challenge to effective tobacco control for this population.159 In many parts of the world, a girl' s access to education is hampered by multiple factors, including familial obligation, scarce financial resources, physical distance to school, language issues, and social and cultural expectations and gender norms.160 The denial of education hinders a woman' s enjoyment of other rights, including her right information, to work and obtain just compensation, to achieve economic and social development, and to enjoy an adequate standard of living.161 In terms of tobacco control, when women are unable to comprehend health information related 111 Winter 2013to tobacco, their ability to control their own health is comprised.162 Additionally, uneducated women may have fewer opportunities to work and gain economic autonomy, and therefore may have less negotiating power to request smoke-free environments.163 The Right to Safe and Healthy Working Conditions : This right is guaranteed by Article 23 of the UDHR, Article 7 of ICESCR and Article 11 of CEDAW .164 In terms of tobacco control, the right to safe and healthy working conditions would obligate the state to implement regulations to minimize the occupational health hazards associated with tobacco production.165 In addition, it would mandate that a state protect its citizens from exposure to SHS in the workplace.166 In a well-publicized 2002 Canadian case, the Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Board recognized that exposure to SHS infringed upon a right to just, equitable, and satisfactory conditions of work and compensated a non-smoking waitress who had acquired lung cancer as the result of her exposure to SHS while working.167 B. The FCTC and State Obligations under the Right to Health Framework Because the right to health is the most obvious right implicated in the tobacco epidemic and has played the most salient role in defending and promoting tobacco control policies,168 this section expands more fully on what the right to health entails in terms of tobacco control and how it may work in conjunction with the FCTC. The preamble of the FCTC describes the intent of the parties to the treaty is to \"give priority to their right to protect public health.\"169 By ratifying the treaty, state parties formally acknowledge that smoking is a major public health threat.170 As an international treaty, the FCTC can be used as a reference document to measure whether states are fulfilling their minimum obligations under the right to health, specifically with regard to tobacco control.171 If a state fails to implement the FCTC, it could be held in violation of the right to health.172 Under a right to health framework, states have basic obligations to respect, protect and fulfill human rights.173 Several sections of the FCTC inform what these state obligations entail in terms of tobacco control.174The duty to respect mandates that state tobacco control programs, including cessation counseling programs, do not discriminate against women or other disadvantaged groups.175 As mentioned above, the FCTC guiding principles stress the importance of non-discrimination and place emphasis on vulnerable groups.176 The duty to fulfill requires a state to enact effective tobacco control, which includes implementing legislation and creating enforcement and monitoring mechanisms of tobacco consumption and its associated health hazards.177 It also requires the provision of accurate information about tobacco use and its health hazards.178 As discussed above, the FCTC includes several provisions on the state' s obligation to provide accurate information on the tobacco epidemic.179 The FCTC describes the responsibilities of states to research and engage in surveillance activities on tobacco consumption, exposure, and their health consequences (Article 20), as well as to report their progress and challenges in implementing tobacco control (Article 21).180 In terms of tobacco control for women, research and monitoring on tobacco consumption, exposure, and their health consequences are essential and have been lacking.181 The duty to protect requires states to ensure that third parties do not interfere with the enjoyment of the right to health.182 General Comment 14 expressly articulates the connection between tobacco control and the duty to protect the right to heath: Violations of the obligation to protect follow from the failure of a State to take all necessary measures to safeguard persons within their jurisdiction from infringements of the right to health by third parties. This category includes such omissions as ... the failure to discourage production, marketing, and the consumption of tobacco.183 Governments have an obligation to regulate the tobacco industry and thwart it from violating the right to health.184 Tobacco companies have introduced a constellation of impediments to the right to health, including generating a market for cigarettes and other tobacco products, creating occupational health risks for workers on tobacco 112 Health Law & Policy Brieffarms, and producing deceptive marketing strategies and advertisements.185 The FCTC elaborates upon these state duties to protect population health from the tobacco industry, including obligations to:186 a. Implement measures to reduce the demand for tobacco (Articles 6 and 7) b. Protect from exposure to secondhand smoke (Article 8) c. Regulate the contents of tobacco products (Article 9), tobacco product disclosures (Article10), and the packing and labeling of tobacco products (Article 11) d. Protect against misleading and false infor - mation on tobacco use (Articles 12 and 13) e. Reduce the supply of tobacco by prohibiting the illicit trade in tobacco (Article 15) and prohibiting sales to and by minors (Article 16) f. Support economically viable alternative livelihoods for tobacco workers, growers, and sellers (Article 17) g. Protect the health of tobacco farm workers (Article 18). The FCTC Guidelines for Implementation (FCTC Guidelines) provide an even more detailed description of a state' s obligation to protect the right to health from the tobacco industry.187 The FCTC Guidelines for implementing Article 5.3 (Protection of public health policies with respect to tobacco control from commercial and other vested interests of tobacco industry) underscore the importance of reducing conflicts of interests between governments and the tobacco industry, and of promoting accountability, and transparency in tobacco control.188 Progressive Realization of the Right to Health : Recognizing that states struggle with scarce resources and that it takes time to fulfill treaty obligations, the right to health is subject to progressive realization.189 Under a duty to progressively realize the right to health, however, States still have \"immediate obligations,\" such as to take steps that are \"deliberate, concrete and targeted towards the full realization of the right to health.\"190 Additionally, states must devote maximum available resources towards the progressive realization of the right to health.191 In terms of tobacco control, the progressive realization of the right to health requires that state devote maximum available resources towards effective tobacco control and policies.192 The Duty of International Cooperation : The right to health also imposes duties upon states to engage in international cooperation and specifically obligates developed states to assist developing states to progressively realize the right to health.193 The FCTC promotes \"the utilization of bilateral, regional, and subregional and other multilateral channels to provide funding for the development and strengthening of multisectoral comprehensive tobacco control programmes of developing country Parties and Parties with economies in transition.\"194 The FCTC also highlights the need for international cooperation to strengthen the scientific, technical, and legal capacities of developing countries and economies in transition to implement more effective tobacco control.195 Shared Responsibilities : The above paragraphs emphasize the duties imposed on states under the right to health. These obligations, however, are shared responsibilities.196 Effective tobacco control requires the involvement of various national and international actors.197 Indispensible among these actors are tobacco companies, who must comply with the regulations set forth by national governments that are aligned with the FCTC.198 A. Rights in Conflict? The tobacco industry contends that tobacco control infringes upon fundamental rights, which have been categorized as the \"right to smoke\" or \"the freedom to smoke.\"199 The industry also argues that the regulation of tobacco advertising, tobacco use, and \"smoke-free areas\" are in conflict with fundamental rights, including freedom of expression and property rights, as well as the right to autonomy and self determination.200 As several legal scholars have noted, the industry' s \"freedom to smoke\" or \"right to smoke\" arguments have no legal footing.201 States are allowed to control and to prohibit the production and dissemination of addictive and harmful substances to its population.202 Further, although the rights 113 Winter 2013to commercial speech and private property have greater legal basis, these rights are not absolute.203 Under a balancing test \u2014 weighing the interests and rights of industry against those of the public, legal scholars have noted that \"there is little or no redeeming value in tobacco consumption\" and that \"any balancing or proportionality test applied to tobacco regulation are likely to weigh heavily in favor of more far reaching restrictions, more regulation, and less misleading information.\"204 B. The Importance of Human Rights to Strengthening Enforcement of the FCTC and Tobacco Control Efforts A human rights framework can be an important legal tool for providing additional safeguards to protect women' s health and rights in the tobacco epidemic; defending tobacco control policies from industry attack in domestic courts; actively promoting stronger tobacco control at the national level; strengthening monitoring mechanisms; and encouraging public participation.205 Providing additional safeguards to protect women' s health and rights in the tobacco epidemic : Human rights instruments are powerful tools to preventing and halting the spread of the tobacco epidemic among women.206 Ratified by 185 countries, CEDAW is the most potent legal instrument to protect women rights.207 CEDAW does not specifically address the tobacco epidemic.208 However, the CEDAW Committee, delegated with the power to make general recommendations and interpret the treaty' s articles, has linked tobacco control to CEDAW' s provisions.209 Under Article 12, which protects a women' s right to health, the CEDAW committee has required governments to provide adequate data on tobacco and women.210 Additionally, in its country periodic reports, the CEDAW committee has drawn attention to the prevalent use of tobacco among women and its deleterious health consequences (Argentina), 211 the dearth of disaggregated data and statistics on women (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and the Netherlands), the prevalence of tobacco addiction among women (Ukraine), and the occupational health hazards of tobacco farming for women (the Republic of Maldova).212 In its sixth periodic report on Argentina, the CEDAW committee \u2014 recognizing that Argentina was also one of the few Latin American countries yet to ratify the FCTC \u2014 recommended that Argentina ratify and implement the FCTC.213 Additionally, linking tobacco control to other human rights (e.g., health, information, education, safe and healthy working conditions) contributes to a deeper and richer understanding of the myriad ways that the tobacco epidemic adversely impacts women' s health and social wellbeing.214 Such an appreciation for the magnitude and depth of the problem will yield more nuanced and effective tobacco control policies for not only women, but for other vulnerable populations as well.215 Defending Tobacco Control: A human rights framework can work in conjunction with the FCTC to defend the tobacco control policies of a state against industry attacks.216 Several courts have grappled with situations that appear to result in a trade-off in rights, pitting the public' s health against industry interests.217 One notable example comes from a Guatemalan case in which the Chamber of Commerce challenged the Guatemalan Smoke- Free Place law, arguing that it restricted economic freedom.218 The Guatemalan Constitutional Court ruled against the Chambers of Commerce and upheld the law.219 Relying upon international treaties such as the ICESR as well as the FCTC (notably, Article 8, which focuses on protection from exposure to SHS), the court applied a balancing test and weighed more heavily the right to health than the right to freedom of commerce in upholding the Smoke-Free Place law.220 Positive Promotion of Tobacco Control : Human rights can also positively promote effective tobacco control policy.221 For example, courts in Peru, Uganda, Canada, and India have found that secondhand smoke infringes upon a person' s right to health, right to life, and the right to a safe, clean environment.222 Accordingly, the courts have mandated that their respective governments enact more rigorous tobacco control regulations to minimize exposure to secondhand smoke.223 Human rights bodies such as the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) have been working towards strengthening the linkages between the FCTC and human rights to positively advance tobacco control at the domestic 114 Health Law & Policy Brieflevel.224 Specifically, the CESCR has used the FCTC as a reference document to evaluate a state' s compliance with its right to health obligations.225 For example, in its 2009 periodic review of Brazil, the CESCR articulated that tobacco control is essential to the enjoyment of the right to health.226 Although the CESCR commended Brazil for ratifying the FCTC, the CESCR censured Brazil for allowing the promotion of tobacco use through advertising of the state party, and permitting smoking in indoor public spaces.227 Citing the FCTC article 8 (exposure to SHS) and FCTC article 13 (banning advertising, promotion, and sponsorship of tobacco products) in the context of Brazil' s compliance with the right to health, the CESCR recommended that Brazil \"take measures to ban the promotion of tobacco products and enact legislation to ensure that all enclosed public environments are completely free of tobacco.\"228 Monitoring Tobacco Control and Encouraging Civic Engagement : The human rights framework also can strengthen monitoring mechanisms and foster greater civic engagement in the design and implementation of tobacco policy.229 The FCTC lacks mechanisms for monitoring or for civil society participation and commentary on the status of the implementation of the FCTC.230 Human rights treaties that are monitored by UN-treaty bodies have such mechanisms, namely through their shadow report system.231 Shadow reports are a way for civil society groups to draw attention to human rights abuses and voice their account of how the government is fulfilling its obligations under a human rights treaty.232 Brazil provides an illuminating example of how the human rights system and the FCTC can work together to enhance monitoring and civic engagement.233 During the CESCR period review of Brazil, international organizations, academic and civil society groups, and non-governmental organizations came together to file a shadow report entitled \"Preventing and Reducing Tobacco Use.\"234 Highlighting the linkages among the right to health, the FCTC, and tobacco control, the shadow report proved instrumental to the CESCR when evaluating Brazil' s compliance to its right to health and when formulating its recommendations.235Additionally, a human rights approach can promote civic engagement by mobilizing the already extant vast network of women' s groups, which have varied agendas spanning diverse human rights issues and regions, towards working on tobacco control policies geared at women.236 Partnerships with these groups are critical to preventing and halting the spread of the tobacco epidemic among women.237 VII. CONCLUSION Ultimately, the tobacco epidemic poses a growing threat to women' s health, especially in the developing world and among vulnerable and marginalized women. It is urgent that effective measures be taken now to prevent the epidemic from causing further deleterious consequences. A human rights framework can be an important legal tool for safeguarding women' s health and rights in the tobacco epidemic. Additionally, human rights instruments can be useful for defending tobacco control policies from industry attack in domestic courts; they are important for actively promoting stronger tobacco control at the national level, strengthening monitoring mechanisms, and encouraging public participation . 1 Annette David et al., Tobacco Use: Equity and Social Determinants , in WORld Healt H ti On: equity , sOcial deteRminants and Public Healt H PROgRammes 199, 200 (Erik Blas & Anand Sivasankara Kurup eds., 2010). 2 WORld HealtH ORganizatiOn glObal RePOR t: m ORtality attRibutable tO tObaccO 4 (2012) [hereinafter glObal RePOR t: m ORtality attRibutable tO tObaccO ]. 3 Id. 4 Id. 5 Id. 6 See Jonathan Samet & Soon-Y oung Y oon, Summary and Overview, in gende R, W Omen & tHe tObacc O ePidemic 2 (Jonathan Samet & Soon-Y oung Y oon eds., 2010) (describing the trend of increasing tobacco use among women). 7 Lorraine Greaves & Natasha Jategaonkar, Tobacco Policies and Vulnerable Girls and Woman: Toward a Framework for Gender-Sensitive Policy, 7 J e PidemiOlOgy cOmm.

These recommendations have been suggested by the Working Group on Tobacco Control, Human Rights and Women that convened on March 21 and 22, 2012 at the Inaugural Conference on Global Health, Gender and Human Rights, which was organized by the American University Washington College of Law and PAHO/WHO. These recommendations do not necessarily reflect the views of the author(s) of the preceding article. The recommendations are divided by the following set of questions based on principles extracted from the PAHO Resolution \"Health and Human Rights\" (CD 50 R.8): Taking into account the national context, financial and legal framework and budgetary constraints of countries: a. Which areas require special attention from government agencies? Right to health; Right to a healthy environment; Right to information; and Tobacco cessation should be covered by public and private healthcare plans. b. What key factors should be identified and included by health authorities and other governmental actors when formulating national health policies and plans consistent with the applicable international human rights instruments that advance tobacco control and protect individual rights to physical and mental health and other related human rights in the context of the legal obligation of creating smoke free environments as established by the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC)? The right to information includes disclosing ingredients in tobacco products and accurate labeling; and Providing health education on the adverse health consequences of tobacco production and secondhand smoke. c. Which key provisions should be included by legislators and other actors when reviewing and reforming national health legislation, incorporating the international human rights instruments especially those that advance tobacco control and smoke free environments? For example, enacting more rigorous tobacco control regulations to minimize exposure to secondhand smoke and complying with FCTC provisions on packaging and labeling of tobacco products as a strategy to protect the right to health. The right to information; The right to a healthy working environment; and Banning misleading terms in advertisement. d. What measures should governments take to ensure the effective implementation of national health policies, plans and laws that protect and promote tobacco control efforts in accordance with the FCTC? There should be coordination among different sectors and governmental agencies related to tobacco control. Specifically, ministries of health, finance, customs, justice, labor, environment, women affairs, and justice should work together; and Health also could be the coordinating hook to bring together various sectors. (The FCTC indeed calls for a national coordinating mechanism.)e. Parliaments and domestic courts play a key role in promoting and protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms. What concrete functions and contributions can those institutions make? Formulate and adopt legislative, administrative, educational, and other measures to disseminate the applicable international human rights instruments on protecting the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and other applicable international human rights instruments related to health as well as the FCTC. f. What measures could be taken by all those members of society at large who are involved in protecting the human rights with respect to tobacco control? Promote, as appropriate, the dissemination of information and knowledge among civil society organizations and other social actors on the applicable international human rights instruments related to health as well as the FCTC; In implementing the FCTC provisions around information, it is important to enlist the support of civic society groups working on the right to information;. Empowering women and girls generally is an important tobacco control strategy; and Health communication strategies should be tailored to women and girls. Taking into account the important role of international organizations, civil society and academic institutions on the promotion and protection of the right to health and other related human rights in the context of tobacco control and creation of smoke free environments: a. What measures could be taken by PAHO and technical teams of Washington College of Law and other universities to strengthen technical cooperation with the human rights committees, organs and rapporteurships of the United Nations and Inter-American systems (Such as the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights) in order to promote and protect the right to health and other related human rights? Formulation of technical opinions; Participation in thematic hearings; PAHO should continue to urge member states to ratify the FCTC as part of their obligation to the right to health; When highlighting the connection between human rights and tobacco control, it is important to draw attention to the rights of women and girls recognized in CEDAW and regional and domestic instruments; PAHO should encourage member states, as part of their obligations under FCTC, to share information regarding strategies for the defense of tobacco control in the case of litigation brought by industry challenging the legality of tobacco control policies. b. How could PAHO and other international agencies promote and stimulate collaboration and research with academic institutions, the private sector, civil society organizations and other social actors, when appropriate, to promote and protect human rights in keeping with the international human rights instruments?

INTRODUCTION In 2011, the United Nations (UN) began a much- needed global conversation by reporting human rights violations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) individuals.1 This report reflects the rapid development of international human rights law regarding LGBTI people over the past decade.2 Conversations between advocates, lawmakers, and policymakers regarding sexual orientation, gender identity, sexual and reproductive health, and LGBTI advocacy are finally occurring, with opportunities for timely interventions. Most human rights instruments still do not adequately address the relationships between sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and the right to health; they rely upon limited notions of the meaning of \"gender\" in international human rights law.3 This background paper will provide context for using human rights to protect and promote the right to health of LGBTI people, and will also explore how human rights law may evolve to better protect the sexual and reproductive rights of all people.II. THE DEVELOPMENT OF LGBTI RIGHTS The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.4 According to United States Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton, in her recent speech entitled Gay Rights and Human Rights , \"rights are not conferred by government; they are the birthright of all people ... because we have rights, the government is bound to protect them.\"5 According to the UN Office for the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), many governments often ignore discrimination based on gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation.6 The OHCHR report detailed that \"around the world people are killed or endure hate-motivated violence, torture, detention, criminalization and discrimination in jobs, health care and education because of their real or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.\"7 The report noted that \"violence against LGBT persons tends to be especially vicious compared to other bias- motivated crimes.\"8 The rights to \"education, human dignity, life, non-discrimination, and equality\" are of utmost importance to LGBTI people.9 If not recognized, the failure to enforce these human rights can have a detrimental effect on the mental, physical health, and social well-being of all people.10 The OHCHR notes that countries should prevent punishment for engaging in homosexual consensual activities and enact and enforce anti-discrimination laws.11 As the Special Rapporteur on the right to health explained: The legal prohibition of same-sex relations in many countries, in conjunction with a *Preston Mitchum received a JD from North Carolina Central University School of Law in 2011 and an LL.M. in Law and Government from American University Washington College of Law in 2012. Lauren Nussbaum received an M.A. in Latin American Studies from Tulane University in 2008 and is expected to receive a JD from American University Washington College of Law in 2014 . This paper was written under the supervision of and in consultation with Daniela Kraiem from the American University Washington College of Law; Cathy Cuellar, PAHO Advisor on Gender and Health; Javier V\u00e1squez, PAHO Regional Human Rights Law Advisor; and Leria, PAHO Consultant on Human Rights. Alejandro Morlachetti, PAHO Consultant on Human Rights, reviewed an earlier version of this paper. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the individual authors and do not necessarily represent the position of the PAHO, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Royal Norwegian Dutch Embassy in Guatemala, the Health Law & Policy Brief, or the American University Washington College of Law.125 Winter 2013widespread lack of support or protection for sexual minorities against violence and discrimination, impedes the enjoyment of sexual and reproductive health by many people with lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender identities or conduct.12 The definitions of \"sex\" and \"gender\" under international human rights law have expanded to include gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation; as a result, the rights associated with these concepts have broadened as well. According to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, states must \"integrate a gender perspective in their health-related policies, planning, programs and research in order to promote better health for both women and men.\"13 Traditionally, this meant promoting the realization of the right to health for women and domestic girls. The international community has expanded the scope of sex-and gender-based discrimination to protect not only heterosexual women and girls, but also LGBTI persons on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.14 For example, some (though not all) of LGBTI persons' rights in regard to health stem from prohibitions of sex-and gender-based discrimination, which many advocates for LGBTI persons interpret to include discrimination against those who do not conform to prevailing gender norms. The Special Rapporteur on the right to health defines gender identity as \"each person' s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the personal sense of the body ... and other expressions of gender.\"15 As a result, all persons have the right to define their own gender identity, including, though not necessarily, through medical procedures.16 The International Commission of Jurists has distinguished gender expression from gender identity, noting \"the notion of what properly constitutes male or female norms has been a source of human rights abuses against individuals who do not fit or conform to the stereotypical models of masculine or feminine.\"17 The Special Rapporteur on the right to health defines sexual orientation as \"each person' s capacity for profound emotional, affectional, and sexual attraction to, and intimate and sexual relations with, individuals of a different gender or the same gender or more than one gender.\"18 According to this definition, sexual orientation is an internal capacity, not a behavior, because it focuses on the capacity for same-sex feelings, not on the action upon those feelings. Despite international legal advances, states continue to employ the more restrictive definition of \"sex\" and use it interchangeably with gender (often referring only to women). This can render the conversation confusing, but understanding the subtleties of and distinctions between sex and gender is crucial to recognizing LGBTI persons' right to health. The ICESCR has noted that \"[the term] sex has evolved considerably to cover not only physiological characteristics but also the social construction of gender stereotypes, prejudices, and expected roles, which have created obstacles to the equal fulfillment of economic, social, and cultural rights.\"19 The persecution of LGBTI individuals when they do not conform to heteronormative ideals \u2014 both in terms of gender identity and sexual orientation \u2014 limits their right to health when they seek access to services. III. VIOLATIONS OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS TO PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH LGBTI advocates have adopted the strategy of defining and applying international human rights law for LGBTI persons to serve as a model for states to adopt or reform domestic legislation, or as a tool to challenge discriminatory laws and policies.20 In 2006, human rights experts drafted the Y ogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in Relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (Y ogyakarta Principles). The twenty-nine non-binding principles, each of which apply an internationally-protected human right to gender identity and sexual orientation, describe states' obligations to protect that right and provide recommendations for civil society.21 The main legal sources of the human rights invoked include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), whose rights are emphasized to apply to all \"regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.\"22126 Health Law & Policy BriefThe human rights violations experienced by LGBTI persons fall into two broad categories: 1) those that directly violate the community' s right to physical and mental health, either through violence or detention, or by restricting access to health information and services; and 2) those that indirectly violate the right to health through the violation of other human rights, which negatively impact victims' right to health. State parties to the ICESCR recognize the right of all citizens to the \"highest attainable standard of physical and mental health.\"23 Both accessibility and acceptability are interrelated and legally enforceable elements under the right to health.24 As such, \"health facilities, goods, and services must be physically and economically accessible to everyone without discrimination on the basis of ... sexual orientation, and other status.\"25 In every region, LGBTI individuals are victims of public and private discrimination and violence in violation of states' human rights obligations to \"to exercise due diligence to prevent, punish, and redress deprivations of life, and to investigate and prosecute all acts of targeted violence\"26 as outlined in the Human Rights Committee' s General Comment No. 6 .27 Public violence and discrimination, including anti-LGBTI laws and state-sponsored discrimination, may lead to arrests, torture, murder, capital punishment, institutionalization, and aversion therapy. For example, in Kyrgyzstan, LGBTI organizations are frequent victims of raids by police officers, who have beaten people present in the office, demanded documents, and threatened to arrest and rape the victims.28 Private discrimination and violence include physical attacks, bullying, and \"corrective\" rape and medical procedures. In South Africa, for example, female- born gender non-conforming people (including lesbians, bisexual women, and transgender men) are subject to constant and unchecked verbal abuse, harassment, ridicule, and intimidation from members of their community, including neighbors and family members.29 In Germany, doctors commonly perform medically unnecessary surgical procedures to alter so-called \"ambiguous\" genitalia without the consent of intersex patients or their families, a procedure that has been flagged by the United Nations Committee against Torture.30Lesbian women are also marginalized made victims of violence and discrimination in many countries.31 For example, in Zimbabwe, lesbian women are raped because of a cultural prohibition on women fully expressing their sexuality.32 The Institute of South Africa, for example, has reported that lesbians are twice as likely to be subjected to violence and are at a higher risk of becoming victims of rape than heterosexual women.33 ICESCR signatories are required to disaggregate health and socio-economic data by sex to identify and remedy health inequalities.34 However, data regarding sexual orientation and gender identity and the particular vulnerabilities of LGBTI persons are often not collected, much less disaggregated in the data.35 This results in health plans and policies that do not consider the needs of LGBTI persons.36 LGBTI individuals continue to suffer from a denial of human rights, including: opportunities to learn, opportunities to work, and opportunities to express themselves freely.37 As a consequence of the discrimination and human rights violations they encounter, LGBTI persons are at increased risk of suicide, mental health problems, substance abuse, and sexually transmitted infections.38 In Ireland, for example, young gay men are up to thirty times more likely to attempt suicide than young straight men.39 In addition to further marginalizing a vulnerable population, ignoring the needs of LGBT persons can lead to concrete health risks for this group.40 For example, lesbians are at increased risk of breast, uterine, and ovarian cancers because they have fewer pregnancies than their straight female counterparts; however, this heightened vulnerability is generally not addressed in the healthcare setting, leaving both lesbians and their healthcare providers unaware that they are at risk.41 Explicit recognition of LGBTI identities may be just as marginalizing. For example, the American Psychiatric Association and the World Health Organization classified transgender identity itself as a medical disorder.42 In the Netherlands, people who want to change their legal gender must undergo sterilization.43 The right to sexual and reproductive health has been recognized as an essential component of the right 127 Winter 2013to health; this right includes the right to \"access to information, as well as to resources necessary to act on that information.\"44 The Special Rapporteurs on the right to education and health have emphasized that sex education should emphasize the \"importance of the sexual diversity approach, which is linked to the gender perspective.\"45 As the Special Rapporteur himself notes, this right is often violated when content regarding LGBTI people is absent from sex education materials.46 For example, Brazil recently suspended new sex education material known as \"anti-homophobia kits\" because they contained images of gays and lesbians.47 Homophobia, or sexual prejudice, occurs when individuals have a negative attitude, evaluation, or judgment directed toward LGBTI individuals, that involves hostility or dislike because of their actual or perceived orientation.48 Because of homophobia, many LGBTI persons are victims of murder, rape, or other forms of discrimination such as denial of housing, denied employment, and dismissed from current employment.49 For example, students who do not conform to traditional gender roles are often denied their right to education, either because of bullying and harassment by students that is tolerated by administrators, or due to expulsion.50 Some states have institutionalized state-sponsored homophobia by allowing the death penalty for consensual same-sex practices or gender identity,51 while others simply ignore private violence against LGBTI people. Violent attacks against LGBTI victims occur from Belgium to Jamaica, often in public and with impunity.52 In some cases, authorities may even punish the victims instead of the attackers, which further drives LGBTI populations underground.53 People, entitled to human rights protections from their governments, are being killed by agents of the State or sentenced to death due to their sexual orientation, gender expression or gender identity.54 Amnesty International, for example, has documented patterns of police misconduct against individuals due to their actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.55 In particular, transgender men and women are likely to be subjected to violence in many countries.56 In Nepal, for example, \"metis (people born as men who identify as women) have been beaten by police with batons, gun butts and sticks, burnt with cigarettes and forced to perform oral sex.\"57 In many countries, transgender men and women are \"punished\" for crossing traditional gender norms and boundaries.58 As one Canadian report explained, \"[t]he notion that there are two and only two genders is one of the most basic ideas in our binary Western way of thinking. Transgender people challenge our very understanding of the world. And we make them pay the cost of our confusion by their suffering.\"59 Furthermore, in many countries, gays, lesbians, and transgender individuals have been unable to peaceably assemble without encountering threats of violence and discrimination.60 During the \"Equality March\" in Poland, participants overheard remarks like \"Let' s get them fags\" and \"We'll do to you what Hitler did with Jews.\"61 Societal prejudice against the notion of \"coming out\" is another source of violations of LGBTI persons' right to health. As a result of these violations, suicide is more prevalent among LGBTI populations than among their straight counterparts.62 Other mental health problems that disproportionally impact the LGBTI community include increased rates of depression, anxiety, and body image disorders, and substance abuse, all of which also pose negative consequences for physical health.63 For example, substance abuse among gay and transgender men is associated with higher rates of unsafe sexual practices and HIV/STI infection rates.64 These disorders are a \"result of leading marginalized lives, enduring the stress of hiding one' s sexuality, or facing verbal, emotional, or physical abuse from intolerant family members and communities.\"65 As a result of widespread violence, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has found that the public health initiatives targeted at LGBTI individuals are undermined because of the fear of seeking treatment.66 This treatment, in essence, leads to increased STI rates among the LGBTI community.67 Homophobia warps sex education and advocacy because the stigma against homosexual activity renders the subject too taboo to discuss, particularly with adolescents.68128 Health Law & Policy BriefMany LGBTI individuals are reluctant to come out to their healthcare providers for fear of homophobic reactions or confidentiality concerns,69 which in turn limits their ability to \"properly access the full range of health services and health information that should be available to them, because traditional views about sexuality create obstacles to the provision of health services.\"70 Prejudices against those who have HIV/ AIDS or who may be at risk may also exacerbate discrimination against gay men by reinforcing stereotypes of sexual promiscuity.71 IV . INTERNATIONAL INSTRUMENTS: PRINCIPLES OF NON-DISCRIMINATION AND EQUALITY IN INTERNATIONAL LA W Parties to the ICESCR and ICCPR are required to incorporate principles into their laws to fulfill their treaty obligations.72 Under the ICESCR, two principles of particular relevance to the LGBTI community are non-discrimination and equality.73 LGBTI individuals are entitled to these legal protections to avoid deprivation of right to life and other fundamental principles under domestic and international law. Under the ICCPR, specific rights are created from which states may not derogate, including the rights to privacy, freedoms of thought and expression, freedom of peaceful assembly and association, freedom of movement, and equality before the law and prohibition of discrimination.74 However, treaty provisions allow states to limit these rights for public health and morality purposes.75 Nonetheless, any limitation of these rights that is based on one' s sexual orientation or gender identity will violate the spirit of Article 26 of the ICCPR, which guarantees equal protection. While sexual orientation and gender identity are not included in the list of classes protected by the Covenant,76 the Y ogyakarta Principles assert that any such limitation would violate international human rights law.77 The ICESCR prohibits discrimination in access to health care on the basis of sexual orientation and \"other status.\"78 According to the Pan American Health Organization, this broad, open-ended language suggests that the ICESR' s list of protected classes is non-exhaustive, and therefore, should protect sexual orientation and gender identity as long as discrimination of these classes obstructs the right to health.79 All parties that sign and ratify the ICESCR are required to emphasize equality of access to health care, facilities, and services to all individuals.80 LGBTI individuals have a right to health care and services, and may not be treated differently from heterosexual and gender-conforming individuals in either an overt or covert manner.81 Training health care professionals, providing resources on reproductive health and STI prevention, and increasing awareness about people living with HIV/ AIDS are crucial to breaking stereotypes of LGBTI individuals.82 International law is very clear in its fundamental guarantee of the right to life,83 and \"the principal international human rights instruments contain provisions explicitly granting equal protection and the right to non-discrimination to 'all people.'\"84 International law must fully develop to include gender identity, gender expression, and sexual orientation in its principles of non-discrimination and equality to ensure that LGBTI individuals are protected under international treaties and statutes. V . RECOMMENDATIONS: USING INTERNATIONAL LA W TO PROTECT AND PROMOTE THE RIGHT TO HEALTH OF LGBTI INDIVIDUALS Creating new legal norms and guidelines for states would help protect the needs of the LGBTI community \u2014 particularly young people as they refine their gender identities and explore their sexuality \u2014 against human rights violations by decriminalizing and prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. These reforms should have a macro focus on society at large, as well as a micro focus on discriminatory treatment of LGBTI persons in healthcare facilities in particular. The following recommendations consist of repealing the criminalization of LGBTI identity and behavior and promoting LGBTI inclusion in healthcare systems. According to the Special Rapporteur on the right to health, criminalization based on gender identity or expression and sexual orientation causes LGBTI 129 Winter 2013individuals to: create a negative stereotype of self; become the victim of prejudice and stereotypes; not receive access to the health care system; and remain outside the reach of the health care system due to fear of persecution.85 Criminalization of LGBTI identities or behaviors creates a societal perception that these individuals should be subject to criminal laws solely because of their orientation or gender identity,86 while decriminalizing same-sex conduct would empower LGBTI individuals.87 As such, it is important for international law to mandate the repeal of laws that criminalize non-conforming sexual behavior and orientation or gender identity or expression. In the existing conditions, health care professionals may be complicit in criminalization. For example, in some countries where homosexuality is considered a crime, health care professionals are required to report those individuals to local authorities, violating their provider-patient confidentiality.88 Domestic laws that mandate health professionals to report their LGBTI patients to authorities should be repealed. The healthcare system must be reformed to adequately meet the particular needs of the LGBTI community by promoting good communication and fostering a welcoming and supportive environment. Governments should fund programs to provide sensitivity trainings and materials to all healthcare professionals, physical and mental health services for transgender individuals, and HIV/AIDS programs that respond to same-sex needs. Also, governments should strengthen data protection regulation in accordance with the right to privacy and provide full protection of personal medical information of LGBT persons, in particular regarding HIV tests and making sure that sensitive data will not be accessed and used by unauthorized third parties. Healthcare facilities need to think beyond the provision of actual care to include the reformation of system forms and policies that allow for non- conforming gender identities, including a space for same-sex partners as well as brochures that discuss LGBTI health.89 VI. CONCLUSION The Delhi High Court decriminalized homosexuality in India two years ago explaining: \"[i]f there is one tenet that can be said to be an underlying theme in the Indian Constitution, it is inclusiveness.\"90 States must take specific acts to limit stigma, discrimination, and violence against LGBTI persons and fully incorporate them into health and other social systems so that they are fully included in society and not discriminated against due to their sexual orientation, gender expression, and gender identity. Across the world all persons, including LGBTI individuals, are created free and equal in dignity and in rights, including the right to health. appEnD iX In a recent report, the Pan-American Health Organization identified targets for public health action to guarantee LGBTI individuals' right to health, divided into five broad topics that encompass both the macro and micro focus. These targets serve as a model for other regional bodies and should be adopted by state entities. Particular attention should be placed on programs and services that impact LGBTI youth and their right to health and gender identities.Topic 1: Consciousness-raising, training, and spreading the word on the most relevant human rights and fundamental freedoms Introduce measures to raise awareness about international and regional instruments and standards relating to the right to health of young people, women, children, LGBTI persons and people living with HIV among health workers and prisons personnel;130 Health Law & Policy Brief Provide young people with information regarding sexual and reproductive health and STIs prevention following international and regional human rights instruments and standards; Undertake targeted awareness-raising for lawyers, judges, criminal justice workers, health care providers and law enforcement officials regarding the human rights of young people, women, children, LGBTI persons and people living with HIV in order to advance changes in national legislation and plans; and Conduct specific training in primary and secondary schools on sexual and reproductive health in a manner consistent with CRC and the CEDAW in coordination with Ministries of Education and Health. Topic 2: Stigma, discrimination and violence against certain groups in situations of vulnerability (women, children, adolescents, and LGBTI groups) Ensure mechanisms of protection, investigation, monitoring and enforcement of human rights violations to avoid discriminatory and violent practices against young people, women, children, LGBTI groups and those persons responsible for murder and/or acts of violence and discrimination are penalized adequately; Support the review of existing laws and policies in the analyzed countries, making sure that laws, plans and polices are aligned with international instruments and standards regarding discrimination and decriminalization of specific sexual conducts; Promote the adoption and implementation of specific legislation and development programs that protect the rights of women, young people, children and LGBTI persons with emphasis on provisions regarding gender identities, sexual orientation and gender expressions; and Issue and enforce laws that prohibit discrimination with respect to women, children, young people, LGBTI persons and other groups in situation of vulnerability, including prisoners, sex workers, and drug users. Topic 3: Legislation, policies, and programs that particularly incorporate adolescents' considerations with respect to their sexual and reproductive health Support the review and revision of existing laws and policies and, where needed, the drafting of plans and new legislation and policy documents in order to align them with international and regional human rights instruments and standards; Include the needs of adolescents in national laws, policies and plans that respond to their needs for access to sexual and reproductive health, in particular: a) establishment of family counseling services and parent education programs; b) access to safe, legal and confidential sexual and reproductive health services including contraception and termination of pregnancy, c) access to skilled personnel (including mental health providers); d) universal access to HIV prevention, treatment and support.; and e) guarantee procedures on informed consent, the right to privacy and freedom of expression; and Review of national surveys to include questions on gender identities and sexual orientation Topic 4: Legislation, policies and programs incorporating the needs of the LGBTI community Introduce changes in the legislation, policies and programs to protect specifically the needs of the LGBTI community, especially young people, against violations of their fundamental human rights (among others, right to life, integrity, freedom of expression and movement, right to education and work); Guarantee non-discriminatory access to healthcare facilities (prevention and treatment) and services by the LGBTI community;131 Winter 2013 Decriminalization of same-sex conduct and other forms of punishing individuals because of their gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation; and Reform laws, policies and plans to incorporate the participation of civil society groups that represent the interest of LGBTI persons in order to advance their fundamental human right to health. Topic 5: Mechanisms for identifying, investigating, prosecuting, penalizing, and monitoring human rights violations and freedoms (including capacity- building for civil society) Training and awareness-raising about the human rights of young people, women, children and LGBTI community and the mechanisms available to challenge violations of these rights; Human resources, capacity and funds for civil society organizations involved in the defense of LGBTI persons, women, children and young people; Designation or establishment of national monitoring mechanisms in Ombudsperson' s offices to monitor implementation of the international and regional instruments and recommendations from international human rights treaty bodies in health services and prisons; and Coordinate national reporting/evaluating mechanisms involving Ministries of Health, Education and Foreign Affairs to include the right to sexual health and other related human rights of young people in the country reports that are submitted to UN and OAS human rights bodies.91 1 UN Issues First Report on Human Rights of Gay and Lesbian People , un n eWs centRe (Dec. 15, 2011), http:// www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=40743. 2 See Sexuality and Human Rights: Discussion Paper , inteRnatiOnal cOuncil On Human RigHts POlicy , 7 (2009), http://www.ichrp.org/files/reports/47/137_web.pdf (discussing the UN' s report on LGBT and Human Rights). 3 Id. at 16 .4 Secretary Clinton' s Historic Speech on LGBT Human Rights \u2014 \"Gay Rights are Human Rights\" , yOutube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MudnsExyV78&feature =player_embedded (last updated Dec. 6, 2011). 5 Id. 6 Discriminatory Laws and Practices and Acts of Violence against Individuals based on their Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity , united natiOns geneRal assembl y 22 (Nov. 17, 2011), http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/ hrcouncil/docs/19session/a.hrc.19.41_english.pdf. 7 un n eWs centRe , supra note 1. 8 See united natiOns , supra note 6, at 8 (distinguishing the uniquely cruel crimes committed against LGBT people). 9 Pan ameRican HealtH ORganizatiOn , tHe RigHt Of yOung PeOPle tO HealtH and gendeR identities : findings , tRends , and taRgets fOR Public HealtH actiOn 3 (2011). 10 Id. at 31. 11 un n eWs centRe , supra note 1. 12 Report of the Special Rapporteur on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, Geneva: Human Rights Council; 2004, para. 38. 13 General Comment No. 14: The Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health (Art. 12 of the Covenant) , united natiOns cOmmittee On ecOnOmic , sOcial and cultuRal RigHts , 8 (Aug. 11, 2000), available at http:// www.unhcr.org/refworld/pdfid/4538838d0.pdf. 14 See Pan ameRican HealtH ORganizatiOn , supra note 9, at 12 (confirming the Organization of American States' decision to expand rights in resolution \"Human Rights, Sexual Orientation, and Gender Identity\" AG/RES 1653). 15 Anand Grover, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the Right of Everyone to the Enjoyment of the Highest Attainable Standard of Physical and Mental Health , united natiOns geneRal assembl y , 6 (Mar. 31, 2011), available at http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49faf7652.html. 16 See The Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity , The Y ogyakarta Principles, http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/ (last visited Feb. 19, 2012) (establishing the medical autonomy over decisions regarding sex and gender). 17 Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and International Human Rights Law: Practitioners Guide No. 4 .

These recommendations have been suggested by the Working Group on Gender Identities and Access to Health Care that convened on March 21 and 22, 2012 at the Inaugural Conference on Global Health, Gender and Human Rights, which was organized by the American University Washington College of Law and PAHO/WHO. These recommendations do not necessarily reflect the views of the author(s) of the preceding article. The recommendations are divided by the following set of questions based on principles extracted from the PAHO Resolution \"Health and Human Rights\" (CD 50 R.8). Resolution CD 50 R.8 of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on \"Health and Human Rights\" reiterates PAHO' s continuous support to its Member States in providing technical cooperation to formulate, review, and \u2014 if necessary \u2014 reform national health plans, policies, and legislation, by incorporating the international human rights instruments applicable in each case \u2014 especially those related to protecting groups in situations of vulnerability. All PAHO Member States recognized in the concept paper, Health and Human Rights (Document CD50/12) and in resolution CD 50 R.8 that \"Human rights law, as enshrined in international and regional human rights conventions and standards, offers a unifying conceptual and legal framework for these strategies, as well as measures by which to evaluate success and clarify the accountability and responsibilities of the different stakeholders involved.\" In various technical documents and resolutions the Directing Council have asked the PAHO Member States to \"advocate,\" \"promote,\" \"protect,\" and \"safeguard\" the human rights of certain groups in situations of vulnerability, especially in the context of services provided by their health agencies (e.g. \"Gender Equality Policy\" PAHO CD 46 R.16 and \"Plan of Action for Implementing Gender Equality Policy\" (PAHO CD 9/13) and Resolution (PAHO CD 49 R.12). Taking into account the national context, financial and legal framework and budgetary constraints of countries: a. Which areas require special attention from government agencies? Strengthening the technical capacity of their health authority to work with the corresponding governmental human rights entities, such as ombudspersons' offices and human rights secretariats, to evaluate and oversee the implementation of the applicable international human rights instruments protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex individuals (LGTBI individuals); Ensuring accurate information for various populations through evidence-based works and practices (evidence-based approach that supports a human rights framework that would benefit LGBTI individuals); Including transition-related care, such as hormones, in the discussion; Elaborating sex-education materials that includes LGBTI people; Including LGBTI in sexual and reproductive health programs. b. What key factors should be identified and included by health authorities and other governmental actors when formulating national health policies and plans consistent with the applicable international human rights instruments that protect LGTBI individuals' rights to physical and mental health and other related human rights?135 Winter 2013 Repealing the criminalization of LGBTI identity and behavior; Promoting LGBTI inclusion in the health care system; Respecting gender identity; Elaborating guidelines and protocols to ensure access to and friendly health services; Providing sensitive training to health personnel; Discussing the importance of understanding gender identity and facilitating access to health care; Focusing on education (including with medical students). c. Which key provisions should be included by legislators and other actors when reviewing and reforming national health legislation, incorporating the international human rights instruments especially those protecting LGTBI individuals? For example, consider abolishing legislation that punishes engaging in homosexual activity and enforcing anti- discriminatory laws. Eliminate laws that prohibit consenting adults from making decisions related to intimate relationships (sexual or otherwise); Incorporate human rights frameworks and negative and positive rights into legislation; Prohibit forced sexual reassignment surgery and other \"corrective\" procedures. d. What measures should governments take to ensure the effective implementation of national health policies, plans and laws that protect the gender identity and sexual orientation of groups in situation of vulnerability such as women and LGBTI groups? Promoting and strengthening capacity building programs for health workers on the international human rights instruments applicable to gender identities and sexual orientation; Adopting ministerial resolutions to facilitate access of LGBTI persons to health care services; Creating \"friendly spaces\" throughout hospitals to make LGBTI individuals feel more comfortable; Elaborating sensitive training to hospital staff in particular regarding human rights of LGBTI individuals; Collecting and elaborating data on LGBTI population. e. Parliaments and domestic courts play a key role in promoting and protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons who are discriminated because of their gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation. What concrete functions and contributions can those institutions make? Make really clear how LGBTI rights fall under sex-discrimination, equal protection clause; Promote the intervention of civil society to file amicus briefs before domestic courts; Promote the intervention of civil society to support and brief legislators about human rights of LGBTI individuals; Provide workshops to train lawyers and judges; Promote accountability to hold state and private actors accountable for discriminating and violating human rights of LGBTI individuals, especially in the health care system. f. What measures could be taken by all those members of society at large who are involved in protecting the human rights of groups in situation of vulnerability because of their gender identity, gender expression and/or sexual orientation? Including LGBTI individuals in the framework of \"human rights.\" Involving the media and the press to prevent stigmatization and change the fact that 136 Health Law & Policy Briefimages always portray \"gay men,\" making invisible the lesbian, intersex, and trans- communities; Involving the media and the press to change the perception of the trans-community related to prostitution or referred to as \"a man dressed as a woman\" as opposed to a trans-woman, etc. Make sure that messages and images are displayed appropriately and accurately; Involving labor unions to increase protection of rights of LGTBI workers could lead to a new consciousness about rights and repercussions for violating those rights; Working from the grassroots-level from pairs and peer-networks; Involving religious leaders on the grassroots level. Taking into account the important role of international organizations, civil society and academic institutions on the promotion and protection of the right to health and other related human rights in the context of gender identities: a. What measures could be taken by PAHO and technical teams of Washington College of Law and other universities to strengthen technical cooperation with the human rights committees, organs and rapporteurships of the United Nations and Inter-American systems in order to promote and protect the right to health and other related human rights of girls, women and LGBTI individuals? Formulation of technical opinions on health; Participation in thematic hearings at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and UN treaty bodies; Visits to health centers and other institutions in countries; PAHO needs to be part of ensuring that accurate information is spread; Work closely with ministries of education and ministries of health to help disseminate accurate information on LGBTI people; PAHO should work with state actors to prohibit forced sexual reassignment surgery and other \"corrective\" procedures; PAHO should promote that legislative agenda includes LGBTI individuals. b. How could PAHO and other international agencies promote and stimulate collaboration and research with academic institutions, the private sector, civil society organizations and other social actors, when appropriate, to promote and protect human rights in keeping with the international human rights instruments that protect girls, women and LGBTI individuals? Developing strategies to include the human rights of LGBTI individuals on papers and investigations on other topics; and Developing strategies to prevent misinformation regarding LGBTI individuals and the information that government agencies give to LGBTI individuals. c. How could PAHO and other international agencies, governments and academic institutions and civil society promote the sharing of good practices and successful experiences among countries so as to prevent stigmatization, discrimination and exclusion of LGTBI individuals. Facilitate the dissemination and sharing of good practices to improve access to health services and care for LGBTI individuals and promote their well-being.137 Winter 2013in ThE nEWs aTTOR nEys as Qui Tam REla TOR s: h OW sTaTE EThics RulEs TRump ThE FalsE claims acT James J. Hennelly* A recent increase in attorneys filing False Claims Act (FCA) cases as qui tam relators1 against their former client healthcare entities raises questions as to whether the FCA bars attorneys from bringing such suits.2 The stakes are high: depending on whether the government opts to intervene in an action, a qui tam relator stands to earn anywhere from fifteen to thirty percent of the proceeds of the action or settlement, which consistently enter the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.3 Nothing in the FCA expressly prohibits attorneys from bringing such cases as qui tam relators.4 Indeed, the primary purpose for the qui tam provisions of the FCA is to increase the number of cases brought by turning any employee into a potential whistleblower. An attorney who reveals information subject to the attorney-client privilege, however, almost assuredly would face disbarment or other professional discipline.5 Courts faced with these issues typically agree that nothing in the FCA expressly prohibits attorneys from bringing such actions against their former clients. Nevertheless, longstanding judicial precedent indicates that the FCA does not trump a state' s ethics rules.6 Most recently, a district court disqualified an attorney relator from bringing a FCA claim that was based on information protected by the attorney-client privilege.7 The case, Fair Labor Practices Associates (FLP A) v. Quest Diagnostics, Inc. , illustrates the challenges courts face in balancing the federal interests in FCA enforcement with state interests in protecting the attorney-client relationship. In this case, one of the qui tam relators was the defendant company' s general counsel from 1993 through 2000, during which time he became aware of a pricing scheme his client offered for the purpose of inducing fee-for-service pull-through business in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.8 The company had suspended the illegal billing scheme before Quest Diagnostics purchased the company, after which the new CEO reinstituted the illegal billing scheme.9 Though he no longer served as the general counsel, the relator had knowledge of the defendant' s continuation of the illegal scheme.10 Cases like FLP A where attorneys bring qui tam actions against former clients implicate several of the Model Rules of Professional Conduct (MRPC). For instance, Rule 1.9(a) prohibits a lawyer who has formerly represented a client from thereafter \"represent[ing] another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person' s interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client ....\"11 In this context, the question becomes whether the attorney \"represent[s]\" the government as a qui tam relator, even though she is not representing the government in the capacity of counsel.12 The district court in FLP A found that narrowly interpreting the term \"represent\" to mean \"represent as counsel\" \"would stand squarely in conflict with the spirit of the rule and the great federal interest in preserving the sanctity of the attorney- client relationship.\"13 If future courts adopt this same broad interpretation of the term \"represent,\" attorney relators might be barred outright from bringing qui tam actions against former clients, especially when the attorney was the former client' s general counsel. An attorney bringing a qui tam action against a former client might also violate Rule 1.6 if she reveals information subject to the attorney-client privilege.14 Attorney relators commonly assert Rule 1.6(b)(3)' s \"future crime\" exception as a defense. Under this exception, an attorney may reveal protected information \"to prevent, mitigate or rectify * James J. Hennelly is a third year law student at American University Washington College of Law.138 Health Law & Policy Briefsubstantial injury to the financial interests or property of another that is reasonably certain to result or has resulted from the client' s commission of a crime or fraud in furtherance of which the client has used the lawyer' s services.\"15 This is most common in situations where a former in-house counsel knew her client was engaged in illegal activity while employed by the client, and the counsel believes the client is still engaged in the illegal activity, as is the case in FLP A . To assert this exception, the attorney must \"reasonably believe\" that disclosure is necessary to prevent the crime or fraud that is \"in furtherance of which the client has used or is using the lawyer' s services.\"16 According to the court in FLP A , once an attorney is barred from bringing a qui tam action against a former client under Rule 1.9(a), she cannot then claim an exception to the attorney-client privilege under Rule 1.6(b).17 Moreover, the \"future crime\" exception is limited to information necessary to prevent the continuation or commission of a crime; it does not give former counsel the ability to disclose client confidences regarding past conduct.18 Accordingly, an attorney bringing a qui tam action against a former client likely will not be able to circumvent the \"future crime\" exception.19 All of this begs the question of what an appropriate remedy should be when an attorney filing a qui tam action discloses information protected by the attorney-client privilege. The FLP A court disqualified from the case not only the attorney relator, but also his counsel and the other non-attorney relators.20 FLP A is only the latest case to forego allowing an attorney relator to pursue an FCA claim in favor of protecting the inviolability of the attorney-client privilege.21 This trend is likely to continue, as it should. Clients might otherwise be less likely to seek advice from their attorneys or might provide their attorneys with incomplete information. Further, the concern that disqualifying such relators would allow alleged fraud to go unpunished is unwarranted; the FLP A court did not bar the government from pursuing a FCA action against Quest Diagnostics.22 In this sense, disqualifying attorney relators when they reveal protected information does not necessarily conflict with the underlying purposes of the FCA.CONCLUSION Even if an attorney could circumvent Rule 1.9 \u2014 either because a court narrowly interprets the term \"represent\" or because the attorney did not represent the former client in a substantially similar matter \u2014 she would still face difficulty pursing a qui tam action against a former client. Attorneys generally will be barred from bringing FCA claims against former clients unless they can do so without revealing information protected by the attorney- client privilege. Notably, meeting the \"original source\" requirements of the FCA likely would be difficult without revealing at least some information protected by the attorney-client privilege. If the FLP A court' s approach gains widespread acceptance, attorneys will almost assuredly be barred from brining qui tam cases against former clients in this context. Given that courts must resort to interpreting ambiguities in the FCA to resolve these issues, a possible legislative solution would be for Congress to add to the FCA a provision that expressly precludes attorneys from filing qui tam actions against current or former clients. While in some respects prohibiting attorneys from filing qui tam suits is antithetical to the underlying purposes of the qui tam provisions, these whistleblower laws should not erode the attorney-client privilege. 1 The FCA allows private persons, known as \"relators,\" to bring a qui tam action on behalf of the United States when those persons have information that a defendant has knowingly submitted or caused the submission of false or fraudulent claims to the United States. See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(b). 2 See, e.g. , United States ex rel. Repko v. Guthrie Clinic et al., 3:04CV1556, 2011 WL 3875987 (M.D. Pa. Sept. 1, 2011) aff' d, 11-3682, 2012 WL 3104883 (3d Cir.

Jacob Harper* The primary mission of the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is to protect the integrity of HHS programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid) and the health and welfare of individuals served by these programs.1 It carries out this mission through a variety of enforcement tools, most notably the authority to exclude individuals and entities from participation in HHS programs pursuant to Section 1128 of the Social Security Act (SSA).2 Under this authority, OIG must, in many circumstances, pursue the imposition of an exclusion as a result of an underlying criminal conviction.3 The effect of such an exclusion is to bar that individual or entity from participation in Federal health care programs, and, of further consequence, to bar other health care providers who are participating in these programs to employ that individual or entity.4 Because nearly all entities provide, at some level, services payable by a Federal health care program, an excluded individual is, for all intents and purposes, shut out of the United States health care industry.5 The purpose of exclusions is not punitive; rather, these actions are intended to be prophylactic, preventing those who have in some way demonstrated their untrustworthiness from continuing to exploit the Federal health benefits system.6 Once a certain time period has passed, an excluded individual or entity may apply for reinstatement, and the OIG will, after examining the relevant factors and the acts of the excluded during the exclusion period, usually reinstate the individual or entity, allowing them to participate once again in Federal health care programs.7 Of the twenty enumerated bases under which OIG may impose an exclusion pursuant to SSA Section 1128, four are termed \"mandatory\" and sixteen \"permissive.\"8 As the name implies, mandatory exclusions are those which ostensibly punish more severe crimes, and for which the OIG has no discretion whether or not to pursue the exclusion.9 Mandatory exclusions have a five year minimum, but the number of excluded years may be raised through an assessment of several factors, including damage to programs, the egregiousness of the conduct, and the individual' s subsequent cooperation with the government.10 Permissive exclusions, conversely, may be pursued at the discretion of OIG officials \u2014 conduct which may fall within one of the bases of permissive exclusion does not automatically give rise to an exclusion. While the exclusion system is designed to punish offenses on a sliding scale, with mandatory being the most severe and permissive being relatively minor, it occasionally results, in practice, in situations necessitating \"'extraordinary remed[ies],' to be granted 'only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice'\".11 Specifically, when defendants whose involvement in a criminal enterprise is limited agree to a plea deal for a minor crime, they may often remain subject to mandatory exclusion actions.12 In United States v. Pyle , for instance, the defendant provider ultimately pled guilty to one felony count of misprision of (failure to report) a felony.13 While this crime is normally punishable by zero to six months in prison under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, the government moved for downward departure of such a range in light of the defendant' s considerable support in the prosecution of a larger case.14 Nevertheless, the defendant received notice from OIG that it was excluding her under 1128(a)(4), which imposes an exclusion for a \"felony conviction relating to controlled substance.\"15 Dr. Pyle had been tangentially (and largely unbeknownst to her) involved in a steroid trafficking enterprise, and as a result, her underlying felony conviction was related to controlled steroids, thus activating the mandatory exclusion processes.16 * Jacob Harper is a third year law student at American University Washington College of Law.141 Winter 2013While her conviction was eventually vacated through a writ of error coram nobis (a distant cousin of a habeas corpus petition), an action the court described as \"extraordinary\", this is demonstrative of the problem with mandatory exclusions: they fail to allow for the necessary leeway when individual circumstances favor withholding an exclusion.17 In fact, mandatory exclusions signify an expeditious, rather than just, enforcement framework, contrary to the traditional goals of the U.S. legal system. Dr. Pyle' s story is not unique; indeed, many practitioners are excluded for bases that would otherwise seem unduly harsh. The constant thread tying together many of these cases is the failure by defendants' counsel to properly advise the accused of the collateral consequences of a conviction.18 Because criminal defense attorneys, generally, are not well-versed in technical health law administrative matters, many either do not realize that collateral consequences may result or affirmatively advise their clients that no consequences other than those enumerated in the plea agreement will result. Defendants subsequently take an innocuous plea deal (usually a few months of probation) and are later surprised to find that they are being excluded from Federal health care programs as a result of that plea. Reminiscent of the issues involved in the seminal case of Padilla v. Kentucky ,19 many defendants in healthcare matters are opting to avoid litigation and plead out, only to be subject to a career-ending exclusion soon thereafter. Notably, this includes not only well-paid doctors and physicians assistants, but also nurses, certified nursing assistants, emergency medical technicians, and social workers. While the vast majority of exclusions are just and reasonable responses to unlawful conduct, there is a small but growing number of mandatory exclusions which are arguably distortions of justice: too harsh to penalize the underlying crime and unnecessary to sufficiently protect federal monies and beneficiaries. Therefore, in light of these concerns, Congress should consider modification of the existing exclusion framework. Instead of holding out four instances in which exclusion must always be pursued, the Social Security Act should be amended to allow for all twenty exclusions on a permissive basis, at the discretion of OIG officials. This framework will enable the OIG to effectively continue its mission of safeguarding Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal programs and devote more resources toward legitimate exclusion actions and other monitoring efforts. Notably, the defense of exclusions by the OIG during administrative appeals is time intensive, costing the organization significant resources that could be used elsewhere. By reducing the number of questionable exclusions brought as a result of the mandatory exclusion provisions, the OIG can ensure that the exclusions it pursues are worthwhile and effective for the purposes it seeks to achieve. 1 Office of Inspector General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, About Us, (last visited Dec. 12, 2012) https://oig.hhs.gov/about-oig/about-us/index.asp. 2 Social Security Act \u00a7 1128, Pub.

Dotterweich , in which the Supreme Court upheld a drug company president' s misdemeanor conviction for the company' s shipment of misbranded and adulterated drugs in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, even though the defendant had no knowledge of the unlawful conduct.2 The Court reasoned that the president' s guilt was imputed solely due to his authority and responsibility as president of the corporation.3 The doctrine thus came to stand for the proposition that a corporate executive can be held personally liable for a violation if 1) the individual' s position of responsibility allows for the individual to influence corporate policies or activities; 2) there is a connection between the individual' s position and the violation such that the individual could have influenced the corporate actions; and 3) the individual' s action or inaction facilitated the violation.4 The government used this doctrine in the 1960s and 1970s in liability cases related to dirty food warehouses, but the doctrine had fallen out of favor in food and drug cases by the late 1980s.5 More recently, the doctrine had been expanded to apply to both federal and state environmental statutes.6 Lately, however, the government has prosecuted several health care cases by relying on the responsible corporate officer doctrine. For example, in 2007, the Department of Justice brought charges against three officers of Purdue Frederick Co., alleging that the defendants were responsible corporate officers when the company misbranded OxyContin.7 The defendants ultimately pled guilty and agreed to pay $34.5 million in fines.8 Similarly, in 2009, four executives of Synthes Inc. pled guilty to misdemeanor counts of shipping adulterated and misbranded bone cement on the basis of being responsible corporate officers during the time of the events.9 In 2011, the former chief executive of KV Pharmaceutical Co. was charged with, and pled guilty to, two misdemeanor violations for producing and distributing oversized morphine sulfate tablets that could be harmful to patients.10 The implications of being convicted of a misdemeanor or felony are large in the health care industry context. The Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) can exclude individuals and business entities from federally funded healthcare programs,11 and it has the discretion to exclude individuals and entities that have misdemeanor convictions relating to the unlawful manufacture, distribution, prescription or dispensing of controlled substances.12 The OIG used this statutory authority to exclude the individual Synthes and KV Pharmaceutical executives from participation in federal healthcare programs, which effectively ended their careers in the health care industry.13 The OIG also initially sought a twenty- year exclusion for the Purdue executives, which was reduced to twelve years by the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) of HHS.14 Upon appeal to the D.C. Circuit, the court ruled that the twelve-year exclusion was arbitrary and capricious because the DAB did not justify the number of years of exclusion with a reasoned explanation.15 More importantly, however, the court held that the OIG had a statutory right to exclude executives based on a misdemeanor that * Katherine Chau is a third year law student at American University Washington College of Law.143 Winter 2013lacked the element of proof of intent or knowledge of the conduct,16 thereby validating the government' s use of the responsible corporate officer doctrine to impose criminal liability upon and subsequently exclude executives from federal healthcare programs. The D.C. Circuit' s ruling illustrates that the OIG has \u2014 and will continue to exercise \u2014 the right to exclude individual executives from federal healthcare programs for misdemeanors that lack a mens rea element under the responsible corporate officer doctrine. For now, the doctrine remains a strong weapon for regulators and prosecutors to enforce penalties against executives of healthcare companies. 1 See generally Michael E. Clark, The Responsible Corporate Officer Doctrine , 14 No. 1 J. H ealtH caRe cOmPliance 5 (arguing that this trend is supported by regulators and prosecutors because the doctrine is a \"procedural contrivance\" that diminishes or removes their burden of proof and offers them an enormous advantage against defendants). 2 320 U.S. 277, 239 (1943). 3 Id. at 286. 4 Martin Petrin, The Curious Case of Directors' and Officers' Liability for Supervision and Management: Exploring the Intersection of Corporate and Tort Law , 59 am. u. l.

SHOP is very important to small businesses and employees because it extends access to affordable health care to small businesses' employees that were previously priced out of the market. SHOP has become a crucial component of the ACA because it provides a feasible option for small business employees to satisfy the individual mandate provision of the bill, which requires everyone to purchase health insurance coverage. Historically, small businesses were priced out of the health care market due to administrative costs, and high-risk employees tainting the small group of participants to spread those costs to. The average small business is charged approximately eighteen percent more than large businesses for the same health care coverage.4 These higher costs have real- life affects; fifty percent of uninsured Americans are employed at small businesses.5 Additionally, existing plans and markets have been so complicated that small businesses, lacking expertise in the healthcare field with strained or nonexistent human resources departments, were unable to compare prices, benefits, and policies.6 GOALS OF SHOP SHOP seeks to achieve three basic goals: access to affordable plans, provision of employer/employee choice, and uniform standardization for consumers. Affordability Small employers list high costs as the number one barrier to health insurance for their employees.7 Managing costs was a priority of SHOP policymakers, focusing on reducing high costs for the end user in small businesses by reducing the burden on small employers.8 The central tactic to control costs was to attain economies of scale by pooling small businesses, thereby distributing administrative costs and risks while increasing their buying power and reducing the volatility in health premiums for their employees.9 Offering affordable insurance to employees will similarly address adverse risk selection where a disproportionate number of higher risk consumers purchase expensive coverage because of existing health concerns.10 Additionally, exclusive tax credits to employers intend to subsidize small businesses' healthcare costs and encourage businesses to take on higher premium sharing responsibilities.11 This tax credit is currently available to small businesses with fewer than twenty- five full-time employees that make under $50,000 per year.12 To qualify, the business must cover at least 50% of its employee' s health insurance cost.13 The tax credit will then reimburse up to 35% of the costs back to the employer.14 This tax credit extends through 2013, with a new credit beginning in 2014 that is similar but will cover even more of the cost.15 * April Fuller is a third year law student at American University Washington College of Law.The individual mandate is also a cost controlling tool.16 Under the ACA, each person must acquire affordable health insurance.17 If one has access to affordable health insurance, which is defined as a contribution of household income ranging from 2% to 9.5%, and decides not to purchase it, they will be subject to a financial penalty equivalent to the greatest of either $695 per year, or 2.5% of household income.18 This will reduce costs by integrating generally healthy individuals into the risk pool, thereby spreading the risk and eliminating adverse selection. Employer Choice Next, policymakers focused on providing choice for employers and employees to select a plan that meets their needs. The final rule first requires SHOP to offer small businesses the option to select one cost- sharing level, which will allow their employees to choose from any available qualified health plan within that level.19 This would grant employees a substantial amount of choice from varying insurers and plans, similar to those that work at large businesses.20 Additionally, SHOPs have the option to limit employees' choice by forcing them to stay within one plan or set of plans, thereby reducing their options.21 Similarly, SHOPs may allow choice amongst cost-sharing levels, thus greater expanding employee choice.22 Allowing employee choice amongst health plans within SHOP is important because many first-time purchasing employers would prefer their employees to receive a range of plans.23 Similarly, these employers will shoulder less of a burden in deciding which plans and budget would best suit the needs of its employees.24 Also, the employees of small businesses are diverse and, being such, have unique health demands that one plan may not uniformly address.25 Finally, employees currently experience interruptions in their health benefits from yearly changes caused by employers transferring plans in an attempt to distinguish what is best for everyone.26 Permitting the employer to choose his or her own plan would reduce these interruptions, allowing the employee to decide which plan is adequate and whether dissatisfaction warrants a transfer.Comprehensibility and Uniform Standardization The third goal that SHOP seeks to achieve is providing a user-friendly place where small business owners and employees can compare plans and benefits with access to information regarding the plans, options, insurers, and included provider networks.27 SHOPs strive to create centralized marketplaces to assist consumers in understanding their options and facilitate enrollment through user- friendly websites and toll-free hotlines.28 These centralized gathering points should also simplify employers and employees choices by comparing value and benefits.29 Additionally, the website promotes feedback from small business owners on the types and quality of information published including cost and value of plans, standardization and comparison tools, guidance on federal and state employer tax credits, descriptions of services offered by the exchange, and contact information for support staff.30 SHOP will also help standardize healthcare by offering employers' streamlined billing and collection services.31 This is achieved by providing an aggregate billing summary with one monthly bill identifying the total payable to insurance providers, as well as a breakdown of employee benefits and each employee' s responsibility.32 Similarly, the standardization of premiums will facilitate a \"premium calculator,\" comparing available plans for employees and estimating costs after employer contributions, thereby allowing them to shop around.33 All of these capabilities are an effort to simplify and standardize the insurance market, providing employers with an understanding of their costs, their employees' costs, and of their employees' coverage to payment ratio. CONCLUSION SHOP will provide healthcare options to small businesses focusing on comprehensibility and uniform standardization of benefits, affordability and financial assistance in the form of tax credits, and a choice amongst varying plans and insurers. This will allow employees to participate in the plan that best suit their personal needs, thereby providing an affordable and feasible option for employees of small businesses to comply with ACA' s upcoming mandates.146 Health Law & Policy Brief1 Julia James, Small Business Insurance Exchanges.
