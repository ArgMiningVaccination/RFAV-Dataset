With deep roots in ancient cultures, healing crystals of varying shapes and color tones have been tapped into for increased emotional, physical and [spiritual](https://thedigestonline.com/health/mantras-for-positive-change/) wellbeing. As a common additive to Reiki sessions\u2014best described as non-invasive techniques to restore the body's natural healing abilities\u2014many individuals feel wholly supported by integrating crystal energy into their everyday lives. \"Healing stones operate similarly to magnets, where they have the ability to transform what is happening energetically in your body at the cellular level,\" says Danielle Marie, Jersey City-based Reiki Master who practices with crystals through her business entity, [Danielle Marie Reiki](https://daniellemariereiki.com/). \"When crystals are placed over certain parts of the body, the signature of the crystal causes shifts and changes in vibration within the body's energetic fields or chakra system.\" Danielle has been working with crystals as a healing modality for over six years, even before she began her Reiki training through Reiki Traveler. She's incorporated crystals into her own life to feel their effects, using simple practices such as clenching stones to fall asleep at [night](https://thedigestonline.com/blogs/7-benefits-of-reading-every-night/), keeping them under pillows and tucking them into clothing. Understanding Healing Stones Understanding these effects is very specific to each stone, and since there are almost an infinite amount of outcomes including strengthened intuition, induced calmness and serenity, [creativity](https://thedigestonline.com/arts-culture/how-do-you-get-in-a-creative-mood-2/), and manifestation, it may lead to a difficult decision in determining which stone is right to personally practice with. \"For people just beginning to work with stones, there's an old saying that 'you don't choose your crystals, your crystals choose you,'\" Danielle advises. She suggests when you find yourself looking at an array of crystals, take a moment to see what catches the eye, interact with the various stones and decide which ones feel best from there. \"The fact that you are attracted to how a particular crystal looks or feels is a good indication that you'll probably benefit from it in some way.\" So, what exactly can healing stones bring to your lifestyle? From clearing a clouded mind to combating feelings of anxiousness, we've highlighted a few crystals to consider (and what they focus on healing) for your journey towards growth and enlightenment. Amethyst Amethyst is considered one of the most protective stones.

Clear Quartz This traditionally six-sided crystal is a master healer that stands on pillars of clarity, activation and all forms of energy escalation.
