Delays/obstacles to CIE implementation and adoption occurred due to COVID - 19 pandemic during Year 2 of the CIE pilot, however, metrics still were a vast improvement over Year 1. Utilization metrics through May 2021 included: 197 Sharp Users , 397 Logins, 653 Searches, 104 Profile Views, 65 Consents, 99 Community Referrals >2,000 CIE enrollees identified as having Sharp Health Plan Communities served through CIE : Downtown, Mission Valley, Southeast San Diego, Encanto, El Cajon, Lakeside, La Mesa, Otay Mesa, Vista, Carlsbad, Escondido, Oceanside Top s ervices/referrals provided through CIE : utilities, food, housing , economic support In addition, at the start of Year 3 of the partnership, Sharp leadership approved moving forward with data integration of select CIE data with Sharp's EHR (Electronic Heal th Record) system, in order to further increase and support utilization, and strengthen the community piece of Sharp's efforts to identify Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2022 - 2025 Current as of: 9/24/2021 Page 22 of 87 Identified Community Health Need - Aging Concerns Objectives/Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2019 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments and address SDOH and health equity in the communities it serves. Exploratory work is well underway to design the impl ementation strategy for this data integration over the next several months/year. Sharp teams continue to work closely with 2 -1-1 San Diego (2 -1-1) on the implementation and data integration plans for CIE, which includes ongoing metrics, such as CIE utiliz ation across the system, referral tracking, impact on case management efficacy and successful connection to needed social services , health care utilization (e.g., inpatient readmissions, unnecessary ED visits, length of stay, etc.) and others. This data wi ll be used to re -evaluate the value and sustainability of CIE for Sharp HealthCare after the third year of the pilot. Background : Beginning in July 2019 , Sharp HospiceCare participated along with multiple Sharp entities (hospitals, medical groups, and he alth plan) in a one - year pilot with the CIE stewarded by 2 -1-1.

Not applicable (NA) a. NA NA NA Behavioral Health Education Stigma Behavioral Health is identified as a health need in SMH's patient community , and although SMH is not an LPS facility, SMH provides resources to address this priority. SMH employs a team of registered nurses and a nurse practitioner working under the direction of a California licensed psychiatric physician. The nurse practitioner s provide psychiatric assessment, treatment and medications to patients in the ED, Observation Units, and In -Patient units at the request of the medical atte nding physician. An interdisciplinary Behavioral Health Committee provides evaluation, direction and oversight to assure behavioral health -related education for facility staff and processes are optimized. Further , SMH's clinical social workers provide pat ients with support, education and resources to help address behavioral/emotional health issues that often accompany many health conditions (e.g., cancer, postpartum depression, physical rehabilitation, etc.). However , the behavioral health needs of SMH's patient community are addressed through the programs/services provided th rough SMV and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major providers of behavioral health and chemical dependency services in SDC.

Improve navigation of the health care system for cancer patients in San Diego County through patient navigation services. a. Continue to offer the cancer patient navigator program to SMH cancer patients. Ongoing SMH Clinical Case Manager, Oncology Administration Cancer Access to Care Patient Navigation Care Management In FY 2021 and FY 2020, cancer patient navigators were diverted from cancer care to assist with COVID -19 patients and patients on other units. Due to the pandemic, the cancer centers also saw a decrease in patients. Despite these circumstances, a substanti al number of patients were supported. In calendar year 2020 , more than 2,800 patients were assisted by S MH's cancer patient navigators in person and virtually . The team includes nurses, a licensed clinical social worker, a genetics counselor, a speech -language pathologist, a lymphedema therapist, a certified dietitian and a palliative care specialist. Nutrition plays a vital role in cancer care, and more than 600 patients were seen at the Cancer Centers of Sharp for nutritional assessment and ongoing supp ort. Nurse navigators provided ongoing guidance for patients and families impacted by all cancer diagnoses through myriad supportive services, including referrals to numerous community agencies , explanation of procedures and test results , assistance with financial resources and more. During an annual review with the navigators from the Cancer Centers of Sharp, the most significant challenge identified was the shortfall in providing navigation services to all Sharp cancer patients. An analysis of pati ents navigated by tumor site was completed using Navigation PowerForm documentation. The top three sites without full navigation support were lymphoma/hematologic, hepatopancreatobiliary/upper gastrointestinal tract (upper GI), and genitourinary system. Fu rther discussion and review with cancer team members prioritized hepatopancreatobiliary/upper GI patients as those in most need of additional navigation support due to the usual late stage diagnosis and high -level complexity of Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2022 - 2025 Current as of: 9/24/2021 Page 26 of 87 Identified Community Health Need - Cancer Objectives/Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2019 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments care. Efforts are underway t o explore avenues for increasing support for this patient population. The Cancer Centers of Sharp HealthCare (Cancer Centers of Sharp), which includes Sharp Chula Vista Medical Center , Sharp Grossmont Hospital and SMH , share direct links to community resources and agencies by service needed as well as information on advance care planning on sharp.com. The Cancer Centers of Sharp also include an online assessment on sharp.com for individuals to assess if at risk and qual ify for a lung screening. Representatives throughout the Sharp system are exploring ways to further assist newly diagnosed cancer patients who are particularly anxious at this vulnerable time. A brochure is in development \u2014 both printed and on sharp.com \u2014 to provide a wealth of information for newly diagnosed patients including: how to prepare for upcoming visits to cancer specialists; what they can do personally and with family and friends to prepare for the days ahead with treatment; and how to access information about cancer services and support provided by Sharp. While developing the brochure, access gaps were identified, and so special efforts are underway to ensure the brochure is easily accessible and that patients have reliable methods for question s to be answered in a timely manner. Planned completion of this project, including the brochure, is fall 2021. b. Provide and refine SMH Cancer Patient Navigation Distress Screening technology to screen, track Ongoing (evaluated annually) VP Oncology Service Line Cancer Fear Continued goals for the Cancer Centers of Sharp's distress screening tool include expand ed use of the tool to increase the number of patients screene d at least one time, as well as the number of pati ents screened more than one time, especially at times of care transitions.

SMH Cancer Patient Navigator Coordinator Oncology Social Workers Sharp Nurses Care Management Logistical support services SDOH (especially financial) COVID -19 had a substantial negative impact on the administration of the distress screening survey as well as impacted results. In 2019, 2,327 surveys were completed versus only 1, 483 in 2020, resulting in a 36% decrease. Challenges in screening patients included intended brevity in patient visit times and exchange of materials to reduce COVID -19 exposure. Staff were also diverted to other responsibilities related to COVID -19, reduc ing staff time to administer surveys. In 2020, overall 36% of Sharp patients reported distress responses as serious or very serious concerns. Also in 2020, patients with cancer expressed overwhelming concern over the COVID - 19 pandemic, as well as housing a nd transportation services amidst the COVID -19 pandemic. The Cancer Centers of Sharp continue to be in frequent communication with patients, ensuring care is not disrupted. Financial concerns and health insurance remained a key source of distress for cance r patients as identified in 2019. More recently, housing and transportation services have become chief patient concerns amidst the COVID -19 pandemic. Distress Screening Background : Beginning in June 2019, an electronic distress screening (available in bo th English and Spanish), using a validated tool distributed by the Cancer Support Community, was implemented. The tool provides easier methods for completion, timely results sharing, report tabulation and chronologic comparison of results for each patient , for monitoring purposes . Algorithms were established for each question to identify information resources for areas of concern and staff member provided support if desired. Distress Screening \u2014 to assess psychological, social, spiritual and practical iss ues contributing to cancer patient distress - has been conducted at SMH over the past Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2022 - 2025 Current as of: 9/24/2021 Page 28 of 87 Identified Community Health Need - Cancer Objectives/Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2019 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments several years . This tool identifies patient needs in greater detail in order to make them actionable and rate them by intensity so that they may be prioritized and addres sed appropriately. Routine reports including number of patients screened, information on the issues that are most challenging for patients and the percentage of patients rated in high distress are reported to the Integrated Network Cancer Program and to hospital entities annually. The information will drive efforts to target and provide additional support and resources to better meet our patient needs. c. Provide and refine SMH Cancer Patient Navigator PowerForm technology to screen, track and respond to psychological, spiritual, practical and other social needs experienced by cancer patients and their families. Ongoing (evaluated annually) VP Oncology Service Line Cancer Fear Care Management Logistical Support Services Data Management/ Technology SDOH (especially financial) Similar to the SMH Cancer Patient Navigator PowerForm, a Social Work PowerForm was implemented in 2019. In 2020, the Social Work PowerForm was modified for better clarity and interpretation of social work documentation. Cancer Patient Navigator PowerFor m Background : Cancer patient navigators across Sharp collaborated to define, develop and propose a new Cerner Oncology Navigator PowerForm. The PowerForm was designed to standardize the cancer patient navigator's documentation, increase efficiency in patient care coordination, and improve overall patient care. By utilizing the PowerForm, n avigators can document their assessment of patient needs and barriers to care , in addition to how they addressed patient unmet needs with appropriate internal and external support services and referrals. The documentation is annually reviewed to identify opportunities for improvement to the navigation program, including increased navigation support for Hepatopancreatobiliary/upper GI patients. 2.

Physician -led Breast Cancer Education Forums were held in October and February. The free ev ents helped 10 community members with a recent breast cancer diagnosis understand their pathology reports, the various stages of their cancer and treatment options. Video recordings of the forums were posted on sharp.com following the COVID -19 outbreak. b. Continue to provide ongoing support groups to members of the community diagnosed with cancer. Ongoing SMH Medical Social Worker, Oncology Administration SMH Clinical Case Manager, Oncology Administration Cancer Education Care Management Free cancer support groups provided a safe environment for nearly 300 attendees to discuss their experience with cancer and learn coping strategies. Monthly groups were offered for friends and family members of patients with cancer; patients and survivors of head and neck cancer; individuals living with a brain tumor or brain cancer and their family and caregivers; and young patients with cancer (ages 20 through early 40s), including a group for those in cancer stages 0 -3, and a group for young pa tients with advanced cancer. In addition, groups were available twice per month for individuals living with breast cancer and those with advanced cancer. Additional support groups were made available virtually by the Cancer Centers of Sharp following COVID -19. This included a twice -monthly general cancer support group for individuals with any diagnosis at any stage, as well as a twice -monthly men's cancer support group. 3. Increase community education on the signs and symptoms of cancer a. Continue to conduct comprehensive community cancer health seminars. Ongoing SMH Clinical Case Manager, Oncology Administration Cancer Education Collaboration Screenings From May to December 2020, the Cancer Centers of Sharp, including the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute, offered a free colorectal cancer screening event.

In FY 2020, a pproximately 250 community members were reached through classes that addressed the mental and emotional well -being of individuals impacted by cancer. This included the monthly Cancer and the Arts class, as well as the weekly Relaxation Skills workshop. In addition, a Cancer and Stress 101 class was offered in November and January. Further, monthly Lunch and Learn workshops invited patients with cancer, survivors and caregivers to a complimentary lunchtime discussion about the emotional aspects of cancer. Due to COVID -19, the Lunch and Learn workshops were converted into a monthly New Cancer Diagnosis webinar focused on coping, adjusting and growing through one's cancer experience. Additional monthly virtual workshops and webinars provided by the Cancer Cente rs of Sharp following COVID -19 included the Art and Chat, Relaxation and Quieting the Mind, Chemo Brain: Improving Memory and Concentration, and Scanxiety: Managing the Fear of Cancer Recurrence workshops, as well as a monthly Survivorship: Life After Canc er webinar. Approximately 40 community members attended classes designed to support nutritional needs during cancer. This included twice -monthly nutrition classes for attendees who were either currently receiving or recently finished treatment for breast cancer as well as their family or friends. In October, a similar class focused on nutrition before, during and after treatment for any type of cancer. In April, both nutrition classes were converted into YouTube video presentations for viewing at any time on sharp.com . As of December 2020, the videos have received nearly 150 views. In FY 2020, a certified lymphedema therapist continued to provide free monthly education classes on lymphedema , as well as educational and community resources Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2022 - 2025 Current as of: 9/24/2021 Page 31 of 87 Identified Community Health Need - Cancer Objectives/Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2019 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments to nearly 40 indiv iduals . The classes were open to anyone in the community with or at risk of developing lymphedema, as well as their caregivers and partners. In addition, Healthy Steps (Lebed Method) classes served approximately 145 attendees in FY 2020. Healthy Steps met weekly from October through mid -March, after which the classes were put on hold through the remainder of FY 2020 in response to COVID -19. In FY 2020, the Laurel Amtower Cancer Institute continued to partner with Sharp HospiceCare to provide free, monthly ACP workshops. Led by a Sharp ACP professional, the workshops educated approximately 25 community members about the ACP process and basic tools for developing an advance directive. In addition, in January, team members and Master of Social Work student int erns provided information and hand -outs on ACP and palliative care to approximately 50 patients, caregivers and visitors passing through the hospital. Team members participated in several events in recognition of Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October. This included a free community event at the OPP, titled Think Pink!

Surveys include point scor es to measure the value of the program content, as well as opportunities for open -ended feedback from community members. b. In collaboration with the Cancer Centers of Sharp, participate in a systemwide initiative to improve community cancer screenings to pre -pandemic (COVID -19) levels. Ongoing VP Oncology Service Line Cancer Screening The Cancer Centers of Sharp saw a decline in breast and colon screening during the COVID -19 pandemic. Patients delayed cancer screenings, and as a result, delay ed cancer diagnoses. Cancer, when identified, shifted to later stage diagnoses than seen in previous years. Recently, the Cancer Centers of Sharp were selected to participate in a national American Cancer Society (ACS)/Commission on Cancer research study w ith a goal of returning to screenings. A portion of the study focuses on monthly initiatives to draw patients back to screenings at pre -COVID -19 levels and beyond. Monthly goals for screenings have been established and are closely monitored. This is a syst emwide initiative for the Cancer Centers of Sharp with engagement from major medical groups, marketing and screening services to achieve breast and colon cancer screenings. c. Continue with annual, systemwide Integrated Network Cancer Program (INCP) community event for prevention, including Ongoing (Annual Calendar Year (CY) Event) VP Oncology Service Line Cance r Education Screening Prevention The Cancer Centers of Sharp offered a free webinar titled Surviving Cancer: Thriving After a Diagnosis in FY 2020 and another is planned for 2021 in October. Due to the pandemic, Sharp adjusted its initial plans for prost ate cancer screening and prevention in order to comply with pandemic -related restrictions.

In planning stages for CY 2022 - 2025 events an in -person prevention education event, an online event was held in the latter half of FY 2020. From May to December 2020, the Cancer Centers of Sharp , including the Barnhart Cancer Center, offered a free colorectal cancer screening event by sending fecal immunochemical testing kits in the mail to nearly 26,200 participants. Nearly 10,400 participants returned the testing kits by January 2021 (a 39.6% r eturn rate). The fecal immunochemical testing results were given to the participant's primary care physician for review. Participants with positive screening results were contacted by letter and by their physician. A colonoscopy was then recommend followin g a positive screening. IT support and resources are required for data extraction and results; however their time has been reprioritized for the COVID -19 pandemic. As a result, obtaining data for this event has been postponed. d. Increase access to appropriate cancer screenings for high -risk community members through expansion of cancer genetics program. Ongoing (evaluated annually) VP Oncology Service Line Cancer Screening Prevention Access to Care Due to the COVID -19 pandemic public health and safety guidelines, cancer genetic counseling visits were converted to remote access. Patients are screened by their physician for potential hereditary risk for several known cancers. Upon referral to the Sharp Cancer Genetics Program, a comprehensive questionnaire is completed, risk models and a pedigree are completed and the patient's individual hereditary cancer risk is assessed. The genetic counselor reviews the information with the patient to confirm result s and adds any pertinent information. If testing requirements are met, testing is completed to confirm the presence of a pathogenic mutation. Based upon the results, the genetics counselor provides a comprehensive care plan to identify appropriate screenin g modalities and frequencies and risk prevention strategies.
