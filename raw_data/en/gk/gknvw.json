Vaccines and Vaccine Manufacturing Vaccines are molecules which indi viduals either ingest, or are injected with, in order to stimulate their immune systems so that growth of pathogens, su ch as bacteria or viruses, may either be curtailed or, ideally, prevented. 3 A wide array of vaccines, particularly childhood vaccines, are already on the U.S. market and comprise a diverse array of different types of vaccines including live whol e virus vaccines, killed vaccines, inactive attenuated viruses (IATV), live attenuated vaccines (LAV), recombinant virus vaccines, and anti-bacterial DNA vaccines. 4 Established and well-known vaccines include th e polio virus vaccine and the decades-old, highly-effective childhood vaccines against generally non-fatal viral illnesses such as measles, mumps, or rubella or potentially lethal bacterial infections such as tetanus, pertussis, or diphtheria. These vaccines are generally accepted and ha ve negligible side effects. 5 More recently developed vaccines include the politically controversial vaccine against the human papillomaviru s and highly experimental vacci nes such as those against anthrax proposed for U.S. military personnel wh ich were not certified as either safe or effective by FDA.6 In between these two extremes are the influenza vaccines. Flu vaccines are manufactured from scratch ever y year and are genera lly safe though not without the potential for serious side effects, as was the ca se with the development of Guillain-Barre syndrome following administratio n of the vaccine for the previous Swine Flu epidemic in the 1976.7 Flu vaccine effectiveness varies greatly from year to year depending upon both the manufacturing process used and whether the particular flu strain 1 JoNel Aleccia, Flu fears ease, but next wave looms , MSNBC, (May 4, 2009), available at http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30563707/print/displ aymode/1098 (last visited May 5, 2009). 2 Ron Winslow and Avery Johnson, Deadlier Strain Would Overwhelm Health Systems , WALL ST.

Despite this recent government inquiry and concerns over whether there is enough vaccine manufacturing capacity to meet demands if a serious influenza pandemic were to strike the U.S., at the present time ther e are only four manufacturers which produce seasonal flu vaccine: 10 Sanofi Pastuer, Inc.; Medimm (formerly Chiron Corporation); and Gl axo SmithKline, Inc. Only two of these companies base the bulk of their manufacturing in the U.S., hence much of the U.S. flu vaccine supply is still manufactured overseas.11 Annual projected doses and flu vaccine products for these four manufacturers for a recent influenza season are in the table12 below, and demonstrate that the combined out put of all manufacturers in a given year is well-below the number of doses required should most of the U.S.'s 300 million-plus citizens require immunization.

Given this predictable limitation in vaccine manufacturing capacity, it should come as no surprise that some wealthy nations have already inked \"preproduc tion contracts\" to guarantee that they will have an adequate supply of swin e flu vaccine should the need arise.13 The Annual Seasonal Flu Vaccine Guessing Game It takes about six months for a seasonal flu vaccine to get to the U.S. public once the decision to actually pursue development and distribution of a new vaccine is made. 14 The decision to develop and distribute a seasona l flu vaccine is one made by the U.S. government: the President delegates authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), who acts through the Center s for Disease Control in Atlanta. The CDC in turn bases its recommendation for the a nnual decision on examination of extensive epidemiological and virology data on the likely virulence of the strains of influenza virus likely to reach the human population; the likel y geographical source a nd species of such a jump to humans (i.e. will it be from Asia or elsewhere, from fowl or swine?); the likelihood of such an influenza causing an epidemic or a pandemic; and on information obtained from its close worki ng relationship with the Worl d Health Organization (WHO) which makes independent recommendations. The decision by the government to \"cook up\" millions of doses of flu vaccine is a major public health initiative for the federal government and a challenge to the pharmaceutical industry. 15 As this article is wri tten the U.S. government has not yet decided whether to call for the development of a swine flu vaccine, but they are inching in that direction. The fear on the government's part is that the particular strain of influenza now going around may ultimately prove as lethal as SARS and they do not want to be caught short while waiting for definitive data to materialize; for this reason the CDC has already set the wheels in motion.16 The essential first step in deve loping a new vaccine is getting examples of the isolated new viral strain (\"seed stock\") to laboratories to begin growth of the influenza virus in eggs.17 The CDC has already sent samples of the new Swine Flu strain to more than ten government and academic laboratories in the U.S.18 The task of these laboratories will be to develop an influe nza virus that \"grows well in eggs and that, when injected into eggs along with a new st rain like H1N1, will swap some of its genes with the new strain,\"19 so that viral particles with th e new strain on th e outside may be selected and ultimately used to create an inje ctable vaccine that will produce immunity in 13 Newsday, Wealthy nations preord ering swine flu vaccine , W ASH.

These surprises notwithstanding, health offici als are now taking some comfort in several facts which are operating against the likeli hood of a much-feared pandemic with high death rates: (1) the current Swine Flu infecti on does not appear to be as lethal as once feared; and (2) the molecular biology of the curre nt viral strain is very similar to that of influenza strains which have both produced re latively mild infections and for which extensive vaccine manufacturing capacity alread y exists. In particul ar, the current H1N1 flu strain is dissimilar from the 1918 Avian flu strain which killed more than 50 million people worldwide. How Fast Can FDA Approve New Vaccines for U.S. Marketing? Once the decision to develop a flu vaccine is made, manufacture of the strain-specific vaccine undertaken by industry and plans for widespread vaccination implemented, manufacturers of any potential vaccine mu st deal with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Because vaccines are biological drug products they fall under the jurisdiction of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at FDA. 23 Although CBER is one of the smallest of th e five Centers at FDA it has a highly motivated and trained staff, many of whom hold joint appointments at the National Institutes of Health, as well as vast expe rience with both vaccine products and dealing with potential infectious disease pandemics. A manufacturer of a new vaccine for treatm ent of Swine Flu would submit a Biologics Licensing Application (BLA) 24 to CBER which would then be assigned to a team of scientists and physicians for a priority review of manuf acturing practice and safety and efficacy data. Although a new marketing appli cation on priority review has a six-month approval clock, it is possible and perhaps even likely that th e turnaround time for 20 Id. 21 LiveScience, Why isn't there a swine flu vaccine?, MSNBC, (Apr. 29, 2009), available at http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/30479510/print/1/dis playmode/1098 (last visited Apr. 30, 2009). 22 See Gostin, supra note 8. 23 See generally U.S. Food and Drug Admin.: Center for Biologics Eval. And Research, available at http://www.fda.gov/cber (las t accessed May 7, 2009). 24 Id. approval on the FDA side would only be a matter of weeks. Once approved, the manufacturer of the new vacci ne would be cleared to sell the vaccine to consumers, clinics, and hospitals. The FDA plays two on-goi ng roles to ensure the safety of vaccines: it evaluates and approves the results of tests on the first vaccine batch \"model,\" and then repeatedly examines successive batches produced for injection into humans to ensure that they mimic the batch \"model\" as closely as possible.25 This continual involvement is necessary because, as the byproduct of natural biologic processes, successive batches of vaccine may differ in composition and thus effectiveness.26 Prevention vs. Treatment: Vaccine Not the Only Weapon This Time Fortunately, the current Swine Flu infest ation appears to differ from recent flu infestations in at least one important aspect : the anti-viral medication Tamiflu appears to be highly effective in the treat ment of this ongoing influenz a as opposed to epidemics in recent years when the drug was of limited or no effectiveness. 27 The availability of a second drug as an effective anti-viral th erapy for established Swine Flu infections dramatically decreases the reliance on a Swin e Flu vaccine alone as the sole bulwark against morbidity and mortality from the infection and significantly increases therapeutic options for U.S. health care providers shou ld problems with producing adequate amounts of the Swine Flu vaccine undergoing developm ent arise. The advantage of an anti-viral medication, such as Tamiflu, is that even if efforts to prevent Swin e Flu infection fail there are therapeutic options for treatment of flu and flu symptoms in infected individuals. Of course, this ra ises the separate issue of wh ether the U.S. domestic supply of Tamiflu is destined for a shortfall as well. Based on recent reports in the media, it would appear that the U.S. has not stockp iled Tamiflu to the same degree as other industrialized nations, Great Britain in par ticular, and may not be so well equipped for influenza disease treatment, as oppose d to prevention, as other countries. 28 One Final Note Perhaps the most interesting international public health take home message from the current Swine flu episode may be gleaned from a recent commentary in The New York Times 29 pointing out the differe nce between the manner in which the Mexican government has handled the current Swine flu outbreak with the way in which the Chinese government handled the SARS crisis in 2002. At a point in the epidemic when the trajectory of the disease and patient mortality were both unknowns, but the worst was feared, unlike the Chinese government the Me xican government did not try to deny there was an outbreak, was not slow in attempting to combat its spread nor did they resist cooperation with foreign investigators. Perhaps some lessons have been learned after all. 25 PETER BARTON HUTT, RICHARD A. MERRILL AND LEWIS A.
