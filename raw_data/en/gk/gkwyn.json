How To Incorporate Spiritual Meditation? Guided meditation is a great way to incorporate spiritual meditation into your life, especially if you're a beginner at spiritual meditation. Here's how you can start spiritual meditation (for beginners): 1. Find a comfortable space and position to enter spiritual meditation. Spiritual meditation can put you to sleep so make sure the position and place you pick are not too comfortable either. 2. Close your eyes and quietly focus on clearing your mind of errant thoughts or stress. Place your right hand over your heart and your left hand over your abdomen. 3. Take deep breaths and focus on them. Let your breaths guide you into a meditative state. Feel the inhales and exhales, the sensations your breathing is creating. 4. Once you're comfortable and breathing naturally, visualize a white light in the center of your forehead. Visualize the brightness of the light, the temperature, etc. This light is your center that will guide you towards your higher power. Tip: You can use a prayer or chant to maintain your focus and calmness as you practice spiritual meditation. 5. As you become comfortable with this bright light, allow yourself to feel connected to your higher power or your divine. You can picture yourself in a green landscape or sitting in a lotus position alongside a riverbank. Explore as much as you want. 6. When you feel connected and relaxed, you can slowly come back to your physical body. Gently wiggle your toes and fingers, gently reacquaint yourself with your surroundings, and sensations of your body. 7. When you're feeling relaxed, slowly open your eyes and end your spiritual meditation practice with a prayer, an affirmation, a mantra, or anything that helps you connect with your divine. Once you're done, you can use journaling to record your experiences, thoughts, or feelings. Remember, after finishing the spiritual meditation, drink lots of water.
