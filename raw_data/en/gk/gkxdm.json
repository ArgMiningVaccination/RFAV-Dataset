' I. INTRODUCTION It is a mother's worst fear. Standing at the bedside of her child, who is lying there so peacefully, sleeping quietly while a vicious disease infects his liver. The doctors come, but the news is not good. All these months on the waiting list have produced nothing. Without a miracle, this precious life will not continue. Too many mothers face this heartbreaking tragedy every day. Their children need life-saving surgeries, but no organs can be found. This suffering spans the globe and touches the lives of people in many nations. Legislators scramble to enact one organ procurement law after another, but the demand for organs is too great. Studies indicate that nothing they can do can retrieve enough organs to bring supply and demand into balance.2 Something else will have to be done. That something else is xenotransplantation. Xenotransplantation is the transfer of tissue or organs from one species to another.3 It has been attempted several times in the past, but survival rates were poor.4 The advent of new drugs that control the body's rejection of foreign substances and the ability to genetically alter potential animal donors to make their organs more compatible with humans, coupled with the desperate need for more transplantable organs, have caused a renewal of interest in the field of xenotransplantation.5 Scientists predict that successful xenotransplantations can occur within two to five years.6 However, laws lag 1.

Part II of this Note discusses the history of organ donation and explains the world's shortage of usable organs. It proceeds to discuss expressed consent and presumed consent as two legal systems of organ procurement that can be implemented to decrease this shortage. The problems and promises of each system are considered in the context of some of the nations that currently employ each. Part Ell of this Note looks at organ procurement laws in the United States; specifically, the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act and its revisions, as well as the National Organ Transplant Act. The major provisions of each piece of legislation are addressed and reasons why the Acts have failed to live up to their potential are examined. Part IV looks at organ procurement laws in Britain, namely, the Human Tissue Act of 1961 and the Human Organ Transplants Act of 1989. Again, the major provisions are reviewed and explanations are provided for their failure to sufficiently increase the supply of organs. Part V introduces the concept of xenotransplantation, noting its history and the ethical considerations involved in transplanting animal tissues and organs into humans. It also looks at the efforts of the United States and Britain to regulate xenotransplantation trials and advances some reasons why Britain is hesitant to proceed with human xenograft clinical trials. Part VI concludes the Note by proposing that, in light of recent findings that diseases are not as large a threat as originally anticipated, Britain should loosen its stance on xenotransplantation by lifting the moratorium on clinical trials. Finally, the Note suggests that Britain should not switch to a system of presumed consent but should expand the laws that it currently has in force to accommodate xenotransplantation. II. ORGAN DONATION A. History of Organ Donation The ability to transplant organs developed around the turn of the twentieth century.' History indicates, however, that medical science has literally been moving toward organ transplantation for millenniums. More than five thousand years ago, the ancient Egyptians used transplanted tissues to reconstruct the noses of syphilis victims.' Scientists have made a variety of attempts at transplantation since that time. In the 1760s, scientists transplanted the teeth of female servants into the mouths of \"fine ladies.\"9 7. See Juliana S. Moore, The Gift of Life: New Laws, Old Dilemmas, and the Future of Organ Procurement, 21 AKRON L. REV. 443,455 (1988). 8. See id. 9. See id. John Hunter, the \"father of scientific surgery,\" with the help of a dentist, obtained teeth from maidservants and transplanted them into the mouths of more distinguished[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. The late I 800s brought the transplantation of skin.'0 Finally, in 1954, the first successful\" solid organ2 transplant was performed.3 This breakthrough brought hope to many suffering from end stage organ failure. Rejection4 of the transplanted organs by the recipients overshadowed the promise of organ transplantation.\" It was not until the development of the anti-rejection drug cyclosporine\"6 in 1983 thatthe number of organ transplants ladies. See J. Englebert Dunphy, M.D., The Story of Organ Transplantation, 21 HASTINGS L.J. 67(1969). 10. See Moore, supra note 7, at 455. 11. The American Council on Transplantation considers a transplant \"successful\" if the organ functions normally one year after the transplantation. See Theodore Cooper, Survey of Development, Current Status, and Future Prospects for Organ Transplantation, in HUMAN ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION: SOCIETAL, MEDICAL-LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES 18 (Dale H. Cowan et al. eds., 1987). 12. Those in the transplant community distinguish solid organs from tissues. Interestingly, however, not all countries categorize organs and tissues in the same way. Generally, solid organs include the kidneys, heart, liver, pancreas, and lungs, while comeas, bone marrow, skin, and blood constitute tissues. See generally Bernard M. Dickens et al., Legislation on Organ and Tissue Donation, in ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATION FOR TRANSPLANTATION 95, 97 (Jeremy R. Chapman et al. eds., 1997). 13. This procedure took place at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston and involved the transplantation of a kidney between identical twins. See Cooper, supra note 11, at 18. The transplant was successful under the definition put forth by the American Council on Transplantation because the kidney functioned for nine years following the procedure. See id. 14. Rejection occurs as a response to the body's identification and elimination of a foreign organism or tissue. See Michael A. DeVita et al., History of Organ Donation by Patients with Cardiac Death, in PROCURING ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANT: THE DEBATE OVER NON-HEART- BEATING CADAVER PROTOCOLS 15, 17 (Robert M. Arnold, M.D. et al. eds., 1995). It is triggered when any organ is transplanted except those from an identical twin. See Howard S. Schwartz, Bioethical and Legal Considerations in Increasing the Supply of Transplantable Organs: From UAGA to \"Baby Fae, \" 10 AM. J.L. & MED. 397, 399 (1985). The immune system, which is responsible for this defensive function, is both sensitive and powerful. See DeVita et al., supra at 17. It can identify and eliminate a single foreign bacteria, as well as reject an entire organ in a few hours. See id. In order for the transplanted organ to be accepted, it must have the same genetic markers as the recipient. See id. This is one of the problems associated with xenotransplantation. Because the organs involved in the xenotransplantation procedure come from a donor of another species, the genetic markers do not match and rejection occurs. Technology now provides scientists the opportunity to \"fool\" the human body into accepting an animal organ by allowing them to inject human proteins into the organ, causing it to be identified as a human organ. For more information regarding this technology see infra note 260. 15. See Mark F. Anderson, The Future of Organ Transplantation: From Where Will New Donors Come, To Whom Will Their Organs Go?, 5 HEALTH MATRIx 249, 252 (1995). 16. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive drug discovered in 1972 by J.F. Borel at the Sandoz Pharmaceutical Corporation. See RENEE C. FOX &JUDITHP. SWAZEY, SPARE PARTS 3-6 (1992). The F.D.A. gave its approval for the marketing of cyclosporine in 1983. See id. By 1989, it was given alone or in combination with other drugs to almost every individual receiving a transplanted organ and was recognized as one of the key factors contributing to the \"boom\" in organ transplantation from the early 1980s through 1990. See id. Notwithstanding its promise for organ transplantation, the use ofcyclosporine came into question beginning in 1991 after the medical community began to question the possible long-term effects of using the drug.2000] IND. INT'L & COMP. L REv. increased significantly.7 Since then, the number of organ transplants performed in the United States each year has mushroomed,8 and now everything from livers to corneas is being transplanted.9 The success of organ transplantation created problems that people in the medical community, as well as legislators, attempted to resolve. The increased viability of organ transplants led to a greater demand for usable organs.20 This, in turn, resulted in an inadequate supply of organs available for See id. See also Nancy L. Ascher, The Pros and Cons of Cyclosporine, in ORGAN SUBSTITUTION TECHNOLOGY: ETiCAL, LEGAL, AND PUBuC PolicY ISSUES 306,307 (Deborah Mathieu ed., 1988) (noting that cyclosporine has three major drawbacks: its expense, its toxic effect on kidneys, and the chance that one of its long-term side effects might be lymphoma). Nevertheless, cyclosporine remains \"the cornerstone of clinical immunosuppression for renal transplantation.\" Paul A. Keown, Molecular and Clinical Therapeutics of Cyclosporine in Transplantation, in IMMUNOSUPPRESSION IN TRANSPLANTATION 1, 10 (Leo C. Ginns, et al. eds., 1999). Cyclosporine has decreased the incidence of rejection. The University of Pittsburgh reported that the one-year survival rates for liver transplants conducted there increased from 32% to 69% following the introduction of cyclosporine; the one-year survival rates for heart transplants increased from 62% to 76%. See Schwartz, supra note 14, at 400. Evidence exists that indicates that cyclosporine, used in combination with other agents, will allow immunosuppression in organ transplantation to achieve the following goals within the next decade: \"patient survival greater than 95%, graft survival greater than 90%, rejection rates less than 10%, incidence of infection less than 10%, and incidence of lymphoma less than 1%.\" See Keown, supra, at 10. 17. See Anderson, supra note 15, at 252. The growth in transplantation was especially large between 1988 and 1997, when the number of transplant recipients increased 49% (from 12,786 in 1988 to 20,672 in 1997). See ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT(\"OECD\"), XENOTRANSPLANTATION: INTERNATIONALPOUCY ISSUES 15 (1999). 18. See Anderson, supra note 15, at 252. 19.

See id. 22. This number reflects the number of organs needed rather than the number of patients on the list because there are some patients waiting for multiple organ transplants. See United Network for Organ Sharing, U.S. Facts About Transplantation (visited Oct. 1, 1999) <http://www.unos.org/Newsroom/critdatamain.htm> [hereinafter UNOS, U.S. Facts]. In 1993 the number of potential recipients (rather than the number of organs needed) was roughly 30,000. See Robert M. Arnold et al., Introduction: Back to the Future: Obtaining Organs from Non-Heart-Beating Cadaver Donors, in PROCURING ORGANS FOR TRANSPLANT: THE DEBATE OVER NON-HEART-BEATING CADAVER PROTOCOLS I, I (Robert M. Arnold, M.D. et al. eds., 1995). The number of potential recipients more than doubled from 1988 to 1994 as well. See UNOS, The Transplantation Miracle Confronts a Lack of Organs (visited Sept. 8, 1999) <http://whyfiles.news.wisc.edu/007transplant/need.htrd> [hereinafter UNOS, Transplantation]. The approximate numbers on the waiting list for that period are as follows: Year Number on the Waiting List (approx.) 1988 16,000 1989 19,500 1990 22,000 1991 25,000 1992 30,000 1993 35,000 1994 37,500 Id.

See id. Statistics from Great Britain indicate that survival rates of infants who have2000] IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REV. dialysis for their survival when kidney transplants would have proved less expensive26 and would have given them a better quality of life.27 Rather than searching for ways to decrease demand, the focus has been on increasing the supply of transplantable organs.28 One way to accomplish this is by creating legislation aimed at increasing the number of organ donors. Two sources of human organs for transplantation exist-living donors and cadavers.29 Because living donors can only donate those organs or tissues that they can live without,30 the potential supply from living donors is limited.-\" Since deceased donors provide a larger number of organs, cadavers represent the primary source of organs for transplant.32 Each year, approximately 4500 cadaveric organs are procured and used in transplant procedures, a number far below the demand.33 Experts expect this number to remain static, while the demand will continue to grow as survival rates increase, thus causing a more undergone liver transplants range from 75-78% for a five year period while those who have undergone heart transplants average about 70% survival for two years. See Deirdre Kelly & A.D. Mayer, Paediatric Transplantation Comes ofAge: The Main Problem Now is Shortage of Donors, Brarr. MED. J, Oct. 3, 1998, at 897. 26. In 1988, the cost of treatment for Americans with kidney failure exceeded five billion dollars. See Caplan, Humans Should Be Allowed, supra note 24, at 225. It has been estimated that the Medicare system alone would save more than $150 million over a five-year period of time if all patients awaiting kidney transplants received one because successful kidney transplants save as much as $60,000 per patient for each five-year period. See Andrew C. MacDonald, Organ Donation: The Time Has Come to Refocus the Ethical Spotlight, 8 STAN. L. & POL'Y REv. 177, 179 (1997). 27. See Caplan, Humans Should Be Allowed, supra note 24, at 225. 28. See Anderson, supra note 15, at 255. Efforts to reduce the demand for organs would involve a broad array of public health efforts such as decreasing the risks of heart disease through proper diet and exercise, treating the hepatitis virus, and preventing alcoholism and drug abuse in order to avoid liver damage. See Jack M. Kress, Xenotransplantation: Ethics and Economics, 53 FOOD & DRUG L. J.353,360(1998). While such efforts should be undertaken, evidence suggests that they would achieve only limited success. See id. 29. See Shelby E. Robinson, Organs for Sale?

REv. 161, 163 (1994) (stating that live donors contribute nearly one-third of the organs donated in the United States and Great Britian. The World Health Organization, however, fears corruption resulting from the taking of organs from live persons and thus looks unfavorably upon live organ donation). 30.

B. Types of Organ Donor Laws Legislation aimed at increasing the number of organ donors takes two forms: encouraged volunteerism and presumed consent. While different countries accept and reject different specific underlying concepts, most have laws encompassing one of these two systems. 1. Volunteerism and Expressed Consent Expressed consent represents the first approach to organ procurement. The idea that individuals voluntarily donate their organs by expressing prior consent to their removal underlies the system of expressed consent.36 Consent may be expressed in various ways, including orally, by will,\" by donor card, or by driver's license.3\" There are also indications that some non-traditional means, such as tattoos, constitute a valid consent for the harvesting of organs.39 Expressed consent laws exist in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Turkey.' The United States employs a variation of expressed consent called required request.4' Under expressed consent laws, organ donors may not receive compensation for their donations other than to 34. See id. 35. The organs that can be taken from a single donor include the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, pancreas, corneas and small intestine. See Kelly & Mayer, supra note 25, at 897 and Moore, supra note 7, at 455. See also REG GREEN, THE NICHOLAS EFFECT: A Boy's GIFT TO THE WORLD 23 (1999) (telling the story of a young boy from California who was killed on an Italian highway during a family vacation. His parents elected to donate his organs and seven individuals benefited from their generosity). 36. See Christian Williams, Combatting the Problems of Human Rights Abuses and Inadequate Organ Supply Through Presumed Donative Consent, 26 CASE W. RES. J. INT'L L. 315,333 (1994). 37. In the United States, gifts of organs made by will are effective immediately upon the death of the donor without waiting for probate. See Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, \u00a74 (a-b), reprinted in MANSON, infra note 108, at 5; Melissa N. Kurnit, Organ Donation in the United States: Can We Learn From Successes Abroad?, 17 B.C. INT'L & COMP. L. REV. 405, 411 (1994). 38. See Altman, supra note 29, at 164. 39. See id. 40. See OECD, supra note 17, at 18. 41. Required request laws mandate that hospitals and doctors inform patients or their families about the possibility of organ donation. See id.; see infra note 52 and accompanying text.20001 IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REv. have their expenses paid.42 Therefore, the motivation for organ donation under these laws lies elsewhere. Altruism,43 coercion, and moral obligation signify reasons why an individual might donate his organs.\" Of these, altruism represents the primary incentive.45 An underlying assumption of expressed consent is that something resembling a property right exists in the body that survives even after an individual's death. This explains, to some degree, why some nations might choose expressed consent over other systems of organ procurement. A nation, such as the United States, with a history of support for individual rights,46 might find those organ donor laws that stress the individual's right to choose what happens to his body fit more closely with the nation's social conscience. In theory, expressed consent laws allow doctors to proceed with organ harvesting upon recognition of some form of donor consent.47 In practice, however, medical personnel in most countries usually do not act without the consent of the donor's family as well.48 Common law recognizes that the family of the deceased has certain rights to his remains that are enforceable by an action in damages.49 Modem statutes limit this right by extending protection from liability to a physician acting in good faith. 'o 42. See Williams, supra note 36, at 333; infra notes 51-60 and accompanying text. 43. Altruism is the \"consideration for other people without any thought of self as a principle of conduct.\" WEBSTER'S ENCYCLOPEDIC DICTIONARY 27 (2d ed. 1990). 44. See Williams, supra note 36, at 333. 45. Altruism provides social benefits not existent in other forms of donation. See Ann McIntosh, Regulating the \"Gift of Life \"-The 1987 Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, 65 WASH. L. REV. 171, 178 (1990). \"Organ donation affirms socially valued human interactions. The donor's experience in enhancing or saving another's life brings the social community together.\" Id. 46. For discussion of an individual's right to make decisions regarding his body see Roe v. Wade, 93 S.Ct. 705 (1973)(affirming awoman's right to have an abortion); Moore v. Regents of theUniversity of California, 793 P.2d 479 (1990) (stating that a man had no property rights to his spleen after it was removed by doctors in a surgical procedure). But see Washington v. Glucksberg, 117 S.Ct. 2302 (1997) (denying an individual's right to assistance in committing suicide). Interestingly, the United States, while adopting an organ donation system based on the individual's right to determine for himself whether to donate, actually limits individual rights in certain ways. Richard A. Epstein, University of Chicago law professor, argues that the failure of the United States to allow a market in organs (The National Organ Transplants Act of 1984 forbids the commercialization of organs in the United States. See infra note 147 and accompanying text.) abrogates the rights of the individual donor to select the recipient of his body parts. See Kress, supra note 28, at 358. 47. See Altman, supra note 29, at 164. 48. See id. at 165. 49. These property rights, however, do not allow the donation of organs for commercial purposes. See EUGENE B. BRODY, BIOMEDICAL TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN RIGHTS 102 (1993). In Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain, the family not only has rights to the body of their relative, but the wishes of the family regarding donation of his organs take priority over the wishes of the individual donor. See DAVID LAMB, ORGAN TRANSPLANTS AND ETHIcs 145 (1990). 50. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA) states in section 7(c): \"A person who acts in good faith in accord with the terms of this Act or with the anatomical gift laws of another[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. state [or foreign country] is not liable for damages in any civil action or subject to prosecution in any criminal proceeding for his act.\" UAGA, reprinted in STATUTORY REGULATION OF ORGAN DONATION IN THE UNITED STATES 7 (R.

INT'L & COMP. L. REV. Some nations with laws based on expressed consent find that the system does not increase the number of available organs for transplant. These countries have changed from their systems ofvolunteerism to either presumed consent or systems of required request and routine inquiry.5 Required request and routine inquiry resemble volunteerism in that an individual may still donate his organs and his family has the ability to consent to such donation as well. The focus of these two systems, however, shifts from one relying on altruism to one that takes a proactive approach to organ procurement by involving the direct action of hospitals and medical personnel. Under routine inquiry, hospitals must inform the family of the opportunity to donate the organs,52 and then let the family make the decision about whether that is what it wants to do. Required request places the burden on the hospitals to expressly request that the deceased's family donate his organs.\" Some suggest that routine inquiry and required request represent a better alternative to encouraged volunteerism for a number of reasons. First, those most closely associated with the potential donor are his family members. These people most likely know the wishes of the individual regarding the taking of his organs, the existence and location of a donor card, and if any other written directives exist that indicate a desire to donate the individual's organs.54 Second, the inquiry made under these systems would come to be expected by the public and consent to the donation of organs would be less suspect because the family has had time to discuss the options together beforehand rather than being confronted with it during the family's time of omits reference to a foreign country and provides that civil immunity shall not extend to cases of \"provable malpractice\"]; South Dakota (S.D.

Caplan, Obtaining and Allocating Organs for Transplantation, in HUMAN ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION: SOCIETAL, MEDICAL-LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES 5, 15-16 (Dale H. Cowan, M.D., J.D. et al. eds., 1987) [hereinafter Caplan, Obtaining and Allocating Organs].[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. grief.\" Third, these systems may have the desired effect of increasing the number of available organs because they still respect the rights of individuals to decide not to donate their organs, they do not jeopardize the right of the individual to leave a written or oral statement about his wishes, and they actually protect the individual's wishes by attempting to involve his relatives who can speak for the deceased.56 The respect for the individual's right to choose whether or not to donate constitutes the most important aspect of these systems.57 This is extremely important in a system that depends upon altruism for organ procurement.\"8 People are unlikely to donate their organs on their own.\"9 By adopting a system that requires hospital personnel to ask for donation and that brings the public to expect questioning about organ donation, altruism is encouraged and the supply of organs is increased.60 2. Presumed Consent Presumed consent offers an alternative to expressed consent. Unlike expressed consent, this system operates under the presumption that an individual desires to donate his organs unless he affirmatively acts to register his opposition.6' Once registered, the individual carries a card indicating his objection to the procedure.2 Presumed consent laws exist in seventeen different countries63 and in some U.S. states.\" Although all are based on the presumption that an individual wishes to donate his organs, the statutes vary from nation to nation 55. By making the inquiry routine, the request would be more easily accepted, as in the case of autopsies performed when death occurs under suspicious circumstances and reports that are completed when a person dies for any reason.

In January 1998, Brazil also adopted a system of presumed consent. See Andrea McDaniels, Brazil Mandates Organ 'Donation 'for Transplants, CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR, Jan. 16, 1998, at 1. Nations that employ presumed consent have seen no clear-cut relationship between the laws and high donation rates. See OECD, supra note 17, at 19. In fact, some nations that operate under presumed consent (such as Switzerland (14.3 cadaveric donors per million population (pmp)), Greece (3.7 cadaveric donors pmp), and Italy (11.6 cadaveric donors pmp)) actually suffer from lower donor rates than some nations using expressed consent (United Kingdom (14.5 cadaveric donors pmp), United States (21.3 cadaveric donors pmp), and Canada (14.5 cadaveric donors pmp)). See id. at 17. Recently, the trend in Europe has been away from presumed consent and toward opt-in legislation. See id. at 19. 64. See LAMB, supra note 49, at 140.2000] IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REV. in both their scope and application. Presumed consent statutes take one of two forms: one of strong presumed consent, and one of weak presumed consent.\"5 Under a system of strong presumed consent, the presumption of consent may be rebutted only by the express wishes of the decedent.6 A system of weak presumed consent, on the other hand, allows the decedent's family to oppose the donation.7 Presumed consent in the United States takes the form of weak presumed consent.6\" Those U.S. states that have adopted the system allow for the removal of the corneas and the pituitary gland, but do not permit doctors to take solid organs from the donors.69 Before removal of the corneas, however, many of the states require that the medical personnel make\"a reasonable search\" to determine whether the individual donor or his family objects.0 Similarly, doctors in Finland, Greece, Italy, Japan, Norway, and Spain ask the donor's family for objections to the procedure.7 Laws in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, France, Israel, Poland, Singapore, and Switzerland, however, allow for the removal of all organs if the doctor finds no recorded objection, but in practice, doctors seldom proceed without the approval of family members.2 Critics of presumed consent argue that the system essentially gives the state a right of eminent domain over the body parts of a potential donor.73 Nations that take this approach have been denounced as historically lacking respect for human rights.4 Some argue that \"if the body is essential to the individual's identity, in a society that values personal integrity and freedom, it must be the individual's first of all to control after. ..life is gone as well. If it is to be made available to others.., it must be a gift.75 Theoretically, a system of presumed consent should result in a greater number of organs for transplant than would a system of expressed consent. 65.

Several nations that have adopted presumed consent are finding that presumed consent provides only a slight advantage over expressed consent in the number of organs procured. a. Presumed Consent in France France adopted presumed consent in 1976 when the Caillavet Law76 was passed. This law allows a person to \"opt out\" of organ donation by signing a writing that expresses his wishes not to donate.77 It further provides that should a person choose not to donate he, or anyone witnessing his objection, may register that objection at the hospital.8 Upon the death of the individual, the physician must check the hospital register for an objection to organ harvesting before proceeding.9 Knowledge of an objection obtained from a third party, even absent a registered objection by the patient, bars the physician from taking the organs.\"0 The system of presumed consent in France works like a system of expressed consent in that it requires the doctor to put forth a reasonable effort to find out the decedent's wishes; however, it does not require that the doctor put forth such effort to determine the wishes of the next of kin.8' Most doctors do make that effort, however, as research shows that in 90.7% of cases, doctors in France notify the deceased's family before removing the organs.82 Presumed consent in France has not achieved the goal of meeting the demand for transplantable organs.83 After twelve years of presumed consent, the nation still experienced a shortage in each area of organ demand.4 76. The Caillavet Law was named after its sponsor and signed into law December 22, 1976 by French President Giscard d'Estaing. See William N. Gerson, Refining the Law of Organ Donation: Lessons from the French Law ofPresumed Consent, 19 NYU J. INT'L L. & PoL. 1013, 1022 (1987). \"It states that 'organ procurement may be done for therapeutic or scientific ends on the cadaver of a person who had not made known his objection to such procurement during his lifetime.\"' Id. 77.

The failure of organ supply to increase commensurate with demand may be attributed to the fact that doctors in France continue to consult with family members before harvesting the organs. See Jami H. Levine, The Organ Procurement Dilemma: Altruism v. Commercialism, 2 KAN. I. L. & PUB. POL'Y 113,117 (1992). 84.

Belgium adopted presumed consent in 1987.85 The law provided for a computerized central Health Authority registry that tracks all individuals objecting to the harvesting of their organs.6 If doctors find no objections noted on the registry, they may legally proceed though, as in France, Belgian doctors usually seek the consent of family members first.\"' The success of presumed consent in Belgium is questionable. While the number of organs procured and transplanted appears to have increased,88 scholars debate whether this increase is attributable to the adoption of presumed consent or the fact that more hospitals now engage in organ procurement.9 Regardless of this increase, however, a significant gap still exists between the number of transplants that occur and the number of patients waiting to undergo the procedure.90 Lung 67 163 Pancreas 43 16 TOTAL 2,882 4,966 See Jefferies, supra note 33, at 637. 85. Some suggest that presumed consent has actually been practiced in Belgium since 1965 when Professor R. Dierkens, Secretary-General of the World Association for Medical Law, introduced a regulation in the teaching hospital of the University of Ghent. See J. A.

A study performed in 1990 found that cadaveric kidney procurement increased 86%, organ procurement on the whole increased 183%, and the total number of organ transplants increased 140%. Another study completed in 1991 showed the increase in cadaveric kidney procurement to be 119% and even greater for multi-organ procurement. See id. at 444. 89. See id. Those experts who believe that the increases are due to the enactment of presumed consent laws discuss their beliefs in the following: L.

Presumed Consent in Austria Austria is the only country to operate under a \"pure\" system of presumed consent.\"' Such a system eliminates the role of the family in consenting to organ donation, making it possible for doctors to proceed without obtaining the family's approval.92 Austrian law requires a written statement of an individual's objection to organ donation in order for the objection to be legally binding.93 Unlike other nations, however, physicians in Austria have no affirmative duty to make reasonable efforts to locate documents that indicate consent or nonconsent4 Furthermore, when doubt exists about the wishes of the decedent, doctors may legally proceed with organ removal.\" Austria enjoys a higher rate of cadaveric organ donors than any other country as a whole.96 It has been alleged, however, that if this success were attributable to the presumed consent laws, then donor rates in each category of organs covered by the law would be higher than donor rates in other countries.\" Statistics show otherwise. Austrian procurement rates for livers exceed similar rates in France and Belgium only slightly, and procurement rates for hearts fall below those in France and Belgium.9\" Success in Austria, therefore, may result more from its two very active transplant teams located in Innsbruck and Vienna than from its adoption of presumed consent.\" Whatever the source of Austria's success in increasing the number of procured organs, demand for usable organs still greatly exceeds supply.\"\u00b0 91.

INT'L & COMP. L. REV. IR. ORGAN DONATION LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES Organ donation regulation in the United States takes its roots in the English common law belief that no one has a property interest in a dead body.'0' While maintaining this basic premise, state courts began to interpret the regulations as granting a \"quasi-property right\" to the family of the deceased, which allowed them to gain control of the body following death for the purpose of providing it a proper burial.'02 As organ transplantation technology developed and the need for donors increased, the limitations of these laws were tested. As a result, statutes began springing up in the states that allowed an individual and his next of kin to donate.'03 These laws were often confusing and contradictory.\" To remedy this, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) met in 1968 and drafted the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA)0' Together with the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA) which followed in 1984, the UAGA provides the foundation for organ donation in the United States. A. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act In order to arrive at a comprehensive plan for the procurement of organs, the drafters of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act (UAGA) faced the challenging task of balancing several important competing interests.'\" These interests included protecting the wishes of the potential donor, respecting the wishes of the donor's family, and recognizing that the state needed to execute successful organ procurement procedures to meet society's demand for usable organs.'\u00b07 The UAGA addressed these concerns by attempting to answer twelve legal questions ranging from who may donate his organs to whether a physician should be precluded from taking part in the transplant because of his interest in preserving the donor's life.' On the whole, the UAGA has 101. See Daphne D. Sipes, Does It Matter Whether There is Public Policy or Presumed Consent in Organ Transplantation?, 12 WHITIER L. REV. 505, 508 (1991). 102. See id.

Who may during his/her lifetime make a legally effective gift of his body or a part thereof?[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. addressed these questions; however, scholars point out that medical technology was not the same in 1968 as it is today, so the UAGA should not be looked at as an inflexible document, but one requiring regular modifications.\"\u00b0 The UAGA received a warm welcome from the states. By 1972, four years after adoption by the NCCUSL, every state and the District of Columbia enacted some version of it into their laws.\" 0 The UAGA provides that any eighteen-year-old who possesses a sound mind may, upon his death, donate all or part of his body.\"' Absent an indication of the donor's wishes, certain others receive the right to determine 2.

How may gifts be made, such as by will, by writing, by a card carried on the person, or by the telegraphic or recorded telephonic communications? 6. How may a gift be revoked by the donor during his lifetime? 7. What are the rights of survivors in the body after removal of the donated parts? 8.

The UAGA has undergone minor modification in some states. Of the modifications made, the most apparent today relate to defining death, outlining procurement protocol, and prohibiting the sale of organs. See Moore, supra note 7, at 445. For example, Illinois has added subsection (g) to section 1 defining death as \"the irreversible cessation of total brain function, according to usual and customary standards of medical practice.\" See ILL.

California added a section entitled \"Determination ofNonavailability\" which outlines the procedures for a hospital to perform while making a diligent search for the persons who are to give consent for the use of a donor's organs. See CAL. HEALTH & SAFETY CODE \u00a77151.6 (West Supp. 1984), reprinted in STATUTORY REGULATION OFORGAN DONATION IN THE UNITED STATES 47 (R. Hunter Manson ed., 2d ed. 1986).

The first concerns the donor card system. Studies show that while the American public, generally, favors organ donation,\"' most do not carry donor cards.\"9 Furthermore, even in the presence of a signed donor card, removal of organs 112. The people who may make the decision on behalf of the donor are listed in order of priority: \"the spouse, an adult son or daughter, either parent, an adult brother or sister, a guardian of the person of the decedent at the time of his death, any other person authorized or under obligation to dispose of the body.\" See id., \u00a72 (b), at 4. 113. Should the donor choose to express his desire to donate in a will, the gift becomes effective at the death of the donor, without having to go through probate. See id. \u00a74(a-b), at 5. If the will is not probated, or if the court holds it to be invalid for testamentary reasons, the gift is still valid if it was made in good faith. See id. Should the donor choose to express his desire to donate by way of other documents, the document must be signed by the donor in the presence of two witnesses who must also sign the document in his presence. See id. Today, the requirement of two witnesses no longer applies unless the donor expresses his intent to donate orally. See Cate, supra note 61, at 73. 114. See Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, supra note I 11, \u00a74 (c), at 5-6. 115. If the donor has designated a specific recipient and has delivered the document to the donee, he may revoke the gift by (1) delivering to the donee a signed statement, (2) making an oral statement in the presence of two witnesses that is communicated to the donee, (3) making a statement to an attending physician during a time of terminal illness or injury that is communicated to the donee, or (4) signing a card or other document that can be found on his person or in his effects.

If the donor made the gift by will, he may amend or revoke the gift using any of the four steps outlined above, or by doing so as provided in the laws regulating the amendment and revocation of will.

A Gallup poll conducted in 1990 indicates that, at that time, 94% of Americans were aware of organ transplants, 84% percent believed that transplants were successful in prolonging and improving the quality of life, and 89% percent said that they would respect their relative's request to donate his organs. See Cate, supra note 61, at 81. A similar poll taken in 1993 indicates that 85% percent of Americans are in favor of organ donation. See MacDonald, supra note 26, at 180. 119. See MacDonald, supra note 26, at 180.[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. usually does not occur without the consent of the family.' The doctor's fear of becoming caught up in conflicts with family members over the removal of the donor's organs, despite provisions in the UAGA releasing a doctor acting in good faith from liability, represents the primary reason for the doctor's failure to proceed with organ removal.' The failure to sufficiently define the time of death constitutes a second criticism of the UAGA. Section 7(b) of the UAGA says only that death shall be determined by the attending physician.2 To alleviate fears that a physician will have conflicting interests in helping his patient survive and in procuring organs for transplant, the UAGA provides that the attending physician shall have no part in obtaining the organs.23 At common law, the cessation of cardiac and respiratory function constituted death.4 In 1968, Black's Law Dictionary defined death as \"[t]he cessation of life; the ceasing to exist; defined by physicians as a total stoppage of the circulation of the blood, and a cessation of the animal and vital functions consequent thereon, such as respiration, pulsation, etc.\"125 With the advent of routine organ transplantation and the ability to artificially maintain the heart and lungs, a definition of death focusing on the cessation of brain activity became more appropriate.6 The Uniform Determination of Death 120.

New York Hospital, 414 N.Y.S. 2d 866, 876 (1979) (extending liability protection to a doctor involved in a situation where a living donor suffered deafness as a result of a kidney transplant, after having signed a release form.

See Schwartz, supra note 14, at 416.20001 IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REV. Act states that death occurs when an individual sustains \"either (1) irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions, or (2) irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brain stem .. .\"127 The third criticism of the UAGA involves its failure to substantially increase the number of available organs.8 The reasons offered for this failure include a general lack of public awareness about organ donation; an unwillingness to donate organs; primarily for religious reasons; and for the fear of death.'29 Inadequacies such as these led to the drafting of a new UAGA. It was adopted by the NCCUSL in 1987 and by the American Bar Association in 1988.30 The 1987 UAGA adopts the system of routine inquiry and required request. This requires hospitals to ask each entering patient whether he is a donor and request a copy of the document authorizing the gift, or discuss organ donation with the patient.'3 The 1987 UAGA also requires law enforcement officers, firemen, paramedics, other emergency rescuers, and hospital personnel to make a reasonable effort to find information indicating the individual's wishes.' Failure to conduct a reasonable search results in administrative sanctions rather than criminal or civil penalties.'33 Finally, the 1987 UAGA forbids the commercialization of organs by disallowing the purchase or sale of body parts for \"valuable consideration... if the removal of the part is intended to occur after the death of the decedent.\"\"' Valuable consideration, within the meaning of the Act, includes \"reasonable payment for the removal, processing, disposal, preservation, quality control, storage, transportation, or implantation of a part.\"'35 States have not been as receptive to the 1987 UAGA as they were to its 1968 127.

The National Organ Transplant Act Regulation of organ transplantation exists on the federal level as the National Organ Transplant Act (NOTA). The Act, adopted by Congress and signed into law by President Reagan in 1984, constitutes the primary federal regulation of organ donation in the United States.3 Congress enacted NOTA in order to alleviate the shortage of organs and to improve the matching of donors and recipients by using a national system for organ procurement and distribution.'39 There are six basic components to NOTA: 1) to establish a task force on Organ Procurement and Transplantation that is comprised of twenty-five members who study a broad range of medical, legal, ethical, economic, and social issues related to organ procurement and transplantation;4 2) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Service to convene a conference on the feasibility of establishing a national registry of voluntary bone marrow donors;4' 3) to create the Division of Organ Transplantation;42 4) to empower the Secretary to make grants for the planning, creation, initial operation, and expansion of organ procurement organizations; 143 5) to require the Secretary to contract for an Organ Procurement and Transplantation network and a Scientific Registry; M and 136. The 1987 UAGA has been adopted in Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.

See id. \u00a7 301. 146. See Robinson, supra note 29, at 1028. 147. Anyone caught in the purchase or sale oforgans commits a felony punishable by a fine of $50,000 and/or five years imprisonment. See National Organ Transplantation Act of 1984, supra note 140, at \u00a7301. 148. It seems these fears werejustified. Evidence of a commercial market for organs in the United States prompted Congress to pass NOTA. See Robinson, supra note 29, at 1028. This evidence consisted of a plan by Dr. H. Barry Jacobs to broker human kidneys from live donors. See id. at 1036. He established an organization named the \"International Kidney Exchange Ltd.\" for the purpose of procuring kidneys from indigent Third World residents. See id. The potential organ donors would set the price for the purchase of their kidneys under Jacobs' plan, and Jacobs would collect $2000 to $5000 for his brokerage services. See id. 149. See id. at 1029. Some believe that NOTA has failed because it gave too much discretion to the task force to study those issues it (the task force) deemed important, allowing the problem of finding solutions to the organ deficit to be neglected. This lack of direction seems to show that Congress' efforts were really aimed at expanding the role of the federal government in organ procurement rather than increasing the number of available organs. See Moore, supra note 7, at 450. 150. See Public L. No. 99-509, 100 Stat. 1874, 2009 (1986) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320b-8 (1994)), reprinted in STATUTORY REGULATION OF ORGAN DONATION IN THE UNITED STATES 215 (Nell M. King ed.

Despite their thirty years of regulation of organ donation in the United States, the Acts simply fail to sufficiently solve the organ deficit.5' The United States must look to other ways of addressing the shortage of organs available for transplant. IV. ORGAN DONATION LAWS IN BRITAIN Government regulation of transplantation occurred in Britain sixteen years before the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act provided a model for U.S. state laws and thirty-two years before the United States adopted its own federal legislation-the National Organ Transplant Act. In 1952, Parliament passed the Corneal Grafting Act, the first statute to directly address tissue transplantation.'59 This Act was repealed nine years later as the need for a more general law dealing with other tissues and organs became necessary.60 154. See id. 155. See id. The Department of Health and Human Services, in April 1998, proposed regulations that would insure that UNOS \"develop an organ allocation system that functions on a 'national' rather than a 'local-regional' basis and gives preference to the most medically urgent patients, defined as those who are very ill but who, according to their physician, have a reasonable likelihood of post-transplant survival.\" Gail L.

This Act provided that an individual, a person in possession of the body, or the person in control of the hospital may request that the donor's eyes be used for therapeutic purposes after his death. See id. at \u00a7 1. 160. See LAMB, supra note 49, at 145.2000] IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REv. Today, two statutes govern organ and tissue transplantation in Britain-the Human Tissue Act and the Human Organ Transplants Act.'6' A. Human Tissue Act of 1961 The Human Tissue Act of 1961 provides the United Kingdom with statutory regulation that governs cadaveric transplants without specific reference to particular tissues or organs.'62 The provisions of the Act resemble the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act that exists in the United States.163 Like the UAGA, the Human Tissue Act creates a system of expressed consent or volunteerism based on the individual's right to determine for himself whether to donate his organs. 64 Section 1(1) allows an individual to request the donation of his organs following his death for the purposes of therapy, education, or research.65 Individuals donate organs by executing a written document or making an oral request for donation in the presence of two witnesses.'66 Section 1(2) indicates that, absent a request for donation, the person in possession of the body may authorize donation after making a reasonable attempt to insure that neither the donor nor his relatives objected to the donation.167 Some criticize the ambiguity of the Human Tissue Act.'61 One area of ambiguity concerns the sufficiency of donor cards. Citizens easily obtain donor cards in Britain,169 and opinion polls repeatedly indicate support for 161. See Siobhan Deehan, The Gift The Gift]. 162. See LAMB, supra note 49, at 145. 163. See Schwartz, supra note 14, at 420. 164. See id. at 420-21. Prior to 1961, it was illegal for an individual in Britain to dispose of his own body. This changed with the adoption of the 1961 Suicide Act. See Trew, supra note 73, at 277. 165. See Human Tissue Act, 1961, 9 & 10 Eliz 2, ch. 54 (Eng.). 166. See id. 167. See id. 168. See LAMB, supra note 49, at 145. 169. See id. When people in the United States think of making an anatomical gift, they generally think of making note of their desires on their driver's licenses. Indeed, some U.S. states, such as Colorado, require individuals to say yes or no to organ donation at the time they apply for or renew their licenses. See Schwartz, supra note 14, at 420. All fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia have a way for donors to indicate their intent on the license. Furthermore, approximately twenty states maintain registries through the Motor Vehicle Association that indicate a driver's choice regarding donation. See Karen L. Smith & Judith B. Braslow, Public Attitudes Toward Organ and Tissue Donation, in ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATION FOR TRANSPLANTATION 34, 42-43 (Jeremy R. Chapman et al. eds., 1997). The opportunities for completing organ donor cards are much greater in Britain, where there is more publication of the need for donors. In 1988, British Telecom mailed four million donor cards with its telephone bills in the London area. Donor cards were also distributed to spectators at a basketball game involving special teams made up of heart transplant patients from the United States. A proposal made in Britain was \"transplant days,\" which would be held once a year, and[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. organ donation.7' Despite this support, however, the majority of the public does not carry donor cards.I'' Even if it did, questions arise as to whether the donor cards satisfy the requirement that organ donation requests occur in an \"authorised form.'72 A second area of ambiguity concerns section 1(2) of the Act. This section provides for the person in possession of the body to authorize donation when no known request for donation exists and reasonable efforts to determine whether the donor or his surviving relatives have any objection to the procedure. 173 No clear authority indicates who constitutes the person \"lawfully in possession of the body.\"'74 Furthermore, the Act fails to define\"surviving relative\" and \"reasonable enquiries.\"'75 The question arises as to what happens when death occurs? Who asks permission to harvest the organs, and from whom does that person seek consent? The concern for saving time in the transplantation process renders these questions significant. After death, doctors have a limited amount of time to retrieve a potential donor's organs before they become unusable.76 Knowing prior to death who is responsible for seeking and giving consent to donation saves time otherwise lost. Finally, critics find the Act ambiguous because it fails to provide a definition of death.77 Doctors and lawyers have attempted to clarify the would allow the public to actually meet transplant surgeons and organ recipients. See LAMB, supra note 49, at 149-150. 170. A Gallup poll conducted on December 30, 1988 showed that 85% of those polled favored organ transplants. Another poll conducted that same year by the British Kidney Patients Association found that 70% of the people responding were willing to donate. See LAMB, supra note 49, at 147. 171. In the poll conducted by the British Kidney Patients Association in 1988, only 29% of those responding to the survey said that they possessed donor cards. See id. A later survey again found that 70% of the population favored donating their organs after death, but only 27% possessed donor cards. Of that number, only two-thirds (19% of the total population) usually carried the cards with them. See Deehan, The Gift, supra note 161, at 1143. 172. Id. 173. See Human Tissue Act, 1961, 9 & 10 Eliz 2, ch. 54 (Eng.). 174. See Deehan, The Gift, supra note 161, at 1143. 175. See id. 176. Body tissue deteriorates rapidly. See Thomas D.

Cowan et al. eds., 1987). Without a constant supply of blood, human organs lose their viability. That is whyit is important for organ harvesting to be performed soon after death, or for the individual to be maintained on artificial life support until the harvesting can occur. See Schwartz, supra note 14, at 416. The time in which an organ or tissue remains viable differs from organ to organ. Livers and hearts endure for only hours, while kidneys may last approximately one and one-half days. See id. at 399. The \"banking\" of these organs is not feasible as it is for blood, which can be stored for up to twenty-one days. See id. 177. See Deehan, The Gift, supra note 161, at 1143.2000] IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REv. meaning of death within the context of the Human Tissue Act.' The Conference of Medical Royal Colleges and their faculties issued statements in 1976 and in 1979 recognizing brainstem death as the criteria for death in the United Kingdom.79 Nevertheless, confusion and fear of organ harvest before actual death occurs remain to the point that an aversion to organ donation exists.80 Despite these shortcomings, the Human Tissue Act of 1961 still plays a large role in the regulation of organ donation and transplantation in Britain. Approximately ninety percent of all organs used for transplants in that country are obtained from deceased donors.' All of these fall under the province of the Human Tissue Act, the governing legislation for cadaveric organ procurement and transplantation in Britain. Unfortunately, the Human Tissue Act has failed to achieve equality between the number of organs needed and the number available.182 B. Human Organ Transplant Act of 1989 The Human Organ Transplant Act of 1989 (HOTA) comprises the second piece of legislation concerning organ procurement and transplantation in Britain. While the Human Tissue Act of 1961 addressed the procurement of cadaveric organs, HOTA focuses on procuring organs from live donors. 183 Controversy surrounding the marketing of organs in Britain gave birth to HOTA. The triggering event occurred when allegations made against doctors accused of transplanting the kidneys of Turkish peasants into wealthy 178. See id.. 179. The brainstem is defined as \"the vertebrate brain excluding the cerebellum and cerebrum.\" WEBSTER'S ENCYCLOPEDIC DICTIONARY 116 (1990). Brainstem death requires only death of the brainstem, whereas brain death implies death of the brainstem and cerebral death. See Ian Y. Pearson, Brain Death, in ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATION FOR TRANSPLANATION 69, 78 (Jeremy R. Chapman et al. eds., 1997). Medical professionals used to rely on brain death rather than brainstem death for determining the point at which death of an individual actually occurred. Its characteristics included coma, absent brainstem and tendon reflexes and an electrically silent brain. See LAMB, supra note 49, at 31-32. Through the work of Mohandas and Chou in Minneapolis in 1971, it was found that, once irreversible damage to the brainstem occurred, there was no chance of survival. See id., at 34. It was not until the 1980s, however, that the gradual realization that the death of the brainstem was synonymous with the death of the individual actually occurred. See id. at 36. 180. A study conducted in Britain in the early 1990s indicated that 30 % of the families refused when asked about donating their relative's organs. See Deehan, The Gift, supra note 161, at 1143. 181. See id. 182. See Siobhan Deehan, New Labour, New Laws?, NEw L.J., July 31, 1998, at 1138 [hereinafter Deehan, New Labour]. 183. A donor is generally defined in HOTA as being a person, either living or dead from whom it is proposed to remove an organ. See Human Organ Transplants Act, 1989, ch. 31, \u00a7l(1)(a) (Eng.).[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. Indian and Pakistani recipients became public.\"4 Soon after this case, Parliament passed the Human Organ Transplants Act of 1989.181 HOTA resembles the National Organ Transplant Act that exists in the United States in that it prohibits the sale or purchase of human organs.'6 It forbids soliciting an organ to buy, negotiating or initiating negotiations for the purchase of an organ, and advertising the sale or purchase of an organ.7 Furthermore, in an effort to eliminate the commercialization of organ procurement, HOTA prohibits the transplantation of organs from living donors into non-genetically-related recipients88 unless certain regulations are met, including evidence that no compensation has been made for the organ.89 Criticisms of HOTA tend to focus on the provision against non-related transplants. Questions exist as to why HOTA requires the approval of ULTRA before allowing non-related persons to receive organs but not related individuals.'\" While related individuals may not be as likely to be involved in the transplant for compensation, the possibility exists that emotional 184. See BRODY, supra note 49, at 115. The allegations against the doctors resulted in the suspension from private practice of Dr. Maurice Bewick, a prominent kidney transplant surgeon, who was found to have transplanted a kidney that had been purchased for $4000 from one Turkish man to another. See Ronald Bailey, The Buying and Selling of Organs Saves Lives, in BIOMEDICAL ETHICS: OPPOSING ViEwPOrNTS 73, 78 (Terry O'Neill ed., 1994). Supposedly, the two men traveled to Britain together for the purpose of carrying out the procedure. See id. At the time the transplant occurred, the sale of organs in Britain was not illegal, however there were guidelines established by the British Transplantation Society that looked at such transactions with disfavor. See id. 185. See Bailey, supra note 184, at 78. 186. See Human Organ Transplants Act, 1989, ch. 31, \u00a7 I (Eng.). 187. See id. 188.

One of these relationships must be proven as specified in regulations made by the Secretary of State. See id. 189. The Human Organ Transplants Regulations SI 1989 No. 2480 establish a regulatory authority to oversee the transplantation of organs from a living donor into a non-genetically related recipient. See David Price & Ronnie Mackay, The Trade in Human Organs, NEW L.J., Sept. 27, 1991, at 1307. It is called the Unrelated Live Transplant Regulatory Authority (ULTRA) and it consists of a chairman and seven to eleven other members. See id. At least three of these members must be registered doctors, and at least four must be non-registered doctors. See id In order for a transplant between non-related persons to be approved, ULTRA must be satisfied that compensation is not involved in the transaction, and the doctor referring the case to ULTRA has clinical responsibility for the donor. See id. Furthermore, if the removal of the organ is not for the medical treatment of the donor, ULTRA must be convinced that the donor has been made aware of the risks involved, understands the nature and scope of the procedure, and consents to its performance. See id. 190. See Deehan, The Gift, supra note 161, at 1143.2000] IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REv. coercion may influence the family member's decision to donate.9 Furthermore, by focusing on genetic relations, HOTA overlooks the opportunity of spouses and cohabitees'92 to donate organs.9' HOTA also requires the satisfaction of other regulations separately created by the Secretary of State in order for the procedure to occur.'94 One of these regulations dictates that the donor voluntarily consent to the procedure upon fully understanding the risks involved.'95 This particular regulation appears extreme in that it requires more of a non-related organ donor than English law imposes in common informed consent cases.'96 The necessity of the regulation also appears questionable because the motivation for the donor to make the gift is the psychological and spiritual benefits involved.'97 Certainly, no physical benefit to the donor occurs from the procedure.' A final criticism of HOTA rests in the assertion that its provisions negatively affect donor rates. By making certain forms of organ donation illegal, HOTA contributes to a general public aversion to donation and enlarges the problem of organ scarcity.\"' Organs remain scarce in Britain, despite the efforts of the Human Tissue Act and the Human Organ Transplants Act.2\"0 Notwithstanding the good intentions behind these initiatives, such poorly drafted, outdated, and restrictive legislation does not produce more organs for transplantation.2\"' Recognizing that the current system of organ procurement fails to achieve the goal of equalizing supply and demand, reformists in Britain began to push for a change. Sir John Biggs-Davison22 proposed an amendment to the Human Tissue Act of 1961 that would revamp existing regulation by making organ donation a matter of \"opting out\" rather than \"opting in.\"23 In 191. See id. 192. \"Cohabit\" means \"to live together, esp[ecially] as husband and wife when not married.\" WEBSTER'S ENCYCLOPEDIC DICTIONARY 190 (1990).

Two polls conducted in Britain indicated that the public was evenly divided on the issue of presumed consent. A follow-up poll that clearly and simply explained presumed[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. 1993, the Advisory Council on Science and Technology (Council) published a recommendation that the Government study the feasibility of introducing such a system.2\"' Dr. Peter Doyle, the chairman of the Council, believes that Britain should adopt presumed consent for two reasons.\"05 First, the reliance on donor cards to contract into donation clearly fails to satisfy the demand for organs.\"6 Second, in those countries using a presumed consent system, very few people registered their objections to the harvesting of their organs.207 Presumed consent has not yet been adopted in Britain. The failure of the British Medical Association (BMA) to support the system constitutes the primary reason for the reluctance of the country to change.08 The reason for the BMA's lack of enthusiasm toward presumed consent is a fear that many of society's disadvantaged would not understand the mechanics of the legislation and would not know how to register their objections to organ donation.09 Some argue that this fear can be relieved by allowing revocation of the registration and by guaranteeing that, absent an indication that the donor did not want to donate his organs, the doctors would be barred from proceeding without the prior consent of the patient's family.210 The studies of presumed consent resulted in twice as many citizens supporting presumed consent than opposing it. See Paul Michielsen, Informed or Presumed Consent Legislative Models, in ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATION FOR TRANSPLANTATION 344, 356 (Jeremy R. Chapman et al. eds., 1997). 204. See Deehan, New Labour, supra note 182, at 1138. 205. See id. 206. Dr. Doyle observed that in 1990, there were no kidneys used in transplantation that had been taken from someone carrying a donor card. See id. 207. See id. It has been argued that, in some nations, the government has made it difficult to register. Therefore, the statistics indicating that people in presumed consent countries do not register their objections may not be accurate. Furthermore, there is no clear-cut evidence that high donation rates result from presumed consent laws. See OECD, supra note 17, at 19. In fact, some nations that employ presumed consent actually have lower donor rates than some nations with expressed consent laws. See supra note 63 and accompanying text. 208. See Deehan, New Labour, supra note 182, at 1138. Depending upon the position of a particular doctor, his attitude toward presumed consent may vary. Approximately 40% of British doctors working in the area of transplantation support presumed consent, while 31% of those same doctors favor expressed consent. See Michielsen, supra note 203, at 357. A large majority of doctors in the ICUs, however, oppose presumed consent. See id. Studies also show that presumed consent is not favored by the British public. In 1998, surveys showed that only 25% of the people in the United Kingdom favored mandatory donation. See OECD, supra note 17, at 18. 209. See Deehan, New Labour, supra note 182, at 1138. This argument is similar to that made against the commercialization of organ procurement in Britain. In fact, the Human Organ Transplants Act of 1989 was adopted in response to the very situation where the poorer segments of society were being taken advantage of See supra note 184 and accompanying text. It seems that the BMA is afraid that if presumed consent is embraced, the lower classes of society might unwillingly become organ donors because they have less knowledge about what must be done to register their objections. 210. See Deehan, New Labour, supra note 182, at 1138.2000] IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REv. consent in France and Belgium' show, however, that requiring consent of the family weakens the presumed consent system, causing it to behave as a system of expressed consent. Perhaps another reason why Britain has not yet embraced presumed consent is that a majority of the general public dislikes it. Surveys conducted by Miranda and Matesanze in 1998 indicate that only twenty-five percent of the population of the United Kingdom supports a system of mandatory organ donation.\"' Should presumed consent ever be adopted in Britain, the lack of public support would surely reduce its effectiveness and probably erase any advantage that presumed consent might have over the current British system of volunteerism. Another, perhaps more likely, reason for the BMA's unwillingness to support presumed consent is that it legally shifts the decision about organ donation from the family to doctors themselves.2\"3 Fear of litigation causes the doctors to be more hesitant about embracing a system that exposes them to possible liability. Again, the study of other nations emphasizes that even though doctors may escape liability if they act according to the law, they are usually very reluctant to proceed with organ harvesting without gaining the consent of the family.2t Given the failure of existing organ procurement regulations to increase the number of organs available for transplant and the reluctance of the medical community, as well as the public, to accept a system of presumed consent, it becomes necessary to look to other ways of increasing the supply of transplantable organs. Xenotransplantation offers an alternative that appears to overcome many of the shortfalls of existing law while potentially bringing an end to the organ supply crisis. V. XENOTRANSPLANTATION Xenotransplantation is not a new phenomenon; however, the term itself is so new that many non-medical dictionaries do not list it.2t5 Generally, \"xenotransplantation\" refers to the replacement, usually by a surgical operation, of a damaged or diseased human organ with a comparable healthy organ from an animal.216 The first hint of xenotransplantation, animal-human transfusions, occurred in the mid-I 660s, shortly after the realization that blood circulated 211. See supra notes 76-90 and accompanying text. 212. SeeOECD, supra note 17, at 18. 213. See Michielsen, supra note 203, at 357. 214. See supra note 48 and accompanying text. 215. See Kress, supra note 28, at 353. 216. See id. The word is actually derived from the Greek word \"xeno\" meaning different. Thus, xenotransplantation means the transplantation of organs from different species.[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. throughout the body.217 Dr. Richard Lower conducted the first authenticated transfusion in which he injected lamb's blood into the veins of a 'mildly melancholic' man in 1667, apparently with no resulting harm.\"' Jean Baptiste Denys, a French philosopher, conducted four similar transfusions in experimental procedures.\"9 Three of the patients survived the transfusions; however, the fourth died, causing the philosopher to be charged with murder.22 The court exonerated him, but a subsequent decree limited further transfusions.22' Three hundred years later, scientists performed the first somewhat successful animal-human organ transplants. In the 1960s, several primate- human kidney transplantations occurred.222 A gentleman in Mississippi received a chimpanzee heart in 1964; however, he survived only ninety minutes following the operation.223 In a subsequent attempt, a man lived for three days after receiving a chimpanzee's heart in 1977.224 The famous case of \"Baby Fae\" occurred in 1984 at Loma Linda, California. It involved the transplantation of a baboon heart into a fourteen day old baby.225 Baby Fae survived two and one-half weeks.226 As these examples indicate, low survival rates plagued early efforts at xenotransplantation. The development of immunosuppressive drugs, however, made the likelihood of longer survival rates following 217. See LAMB, supra note 49, at I11. 218. See id. 219. See id. 220. See id. 221. Perhaps one reason that the decree was issued was the statement that Denys gave describing the results of the transfusion of incompatible blood. It stated: As soon as the blood entered into his Veins, he felt the same heat all along his arm and in the Armpits which he had done before. His Pulse was forthwith raised, and a while after we observed a great Sweat sprinkeled all over his face. His pulse, at this moment was very much altered; and he complained of a great Pain and Illness in his Stomach and that he should be presently choaked, unless we would let him go... By and by he was laid on his bed, and after he had for two hours sustained much violence, vomited up divers liquors which had disturbed his Stomach, he fell into a profound sleep about ten a clock, and slept all that night without intermission till eight a clock the next day... When he awakened he seemed wonderfully composed and in his right mind, expressing the Pain and universal weariness he felt in all his members. He pist a large glass full of such black Urine that you would have said it has been mixed with soot. Id. at 111-112. 222. See id. at 112. 223. See id.

REv. xenotransplantation procedures possible.27 Coupled with the fact that current legislation fails to meet the demand for usable organs,22 increased survival indicates that xenotransplantation represents a real possibility in the effort to eliminate the organ shortage.229 Xenotransplantation offers several advantages over traditional cadaveric organ transplantation.23 Perhaps the most important is the availability of organs for transplant.' Scientists agree that the animal of choice for xenotransplantation purposes is the pig. Unlike the non-human primates, some of which are on the endangered species list,232 pigs, generally, are healthier than primates, which often harbor many viruses that might eventually manifest themselves in the human organ recipients.2\"3 Furthermore, pigs breed easily and often have larger litters than primates,234 thus producing a greater number of potential organs. The ability to make transplants elective procedures constitutes a second advantage of xenotransplantation.235 A successful transplant depends greatly 227. Monkey hearts transplanted into baboon functioned an average of 296 days in experiments using daily treatments that combine cyclosporine, prednisone, and Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF). See Stephen C. Rayhill & Hans W. Sollinger, Mycophenolate Mofetil: Experimental and Clinical Experience, in IMMUNOSUPPRESSION IN TRANSPLANTATION 47, 54 (Leo C. Ginns et al. eds., 1999). Treatments with immunosuppressive drugs occur with allotransplantation (human-human transplantation) as well. In fact, almost all transplant recipients remain on immunosuppressive drugs for the rest of their lives. See Kress, supra note 28, at 354. 228. Demand for organs is increasing as more medical centers are able to perform transplantation surgery and improvements are made in the techniques for managing rejection and infection. The laws simply are not adequate to meet the demand for organs. Even if policies are changed, better access to care, the AIDS epidemic, public ambivalence toward cadaveric organ donation and public health measures such as seat belt laws, higher ages for purchasing alcohol and tougher drunk driving laws all make it unlikely that the number of organs donated will increase. See ARTHUR L. CAPLAN, AM I MY BROTHER'S KEEPER? 104 (1997) [hereinafter CAPLAN, BROTHER'S KEEPER]. 229. Xenotransplantation is being promoted as an alternative to current organ procurement methods because \"it has the most realistic present-day potential for alleviating a certain shortage of organs, thus possibly saving tens of thousands of human lives each year in the United States alone.\" Kress, supra note 28, at 381. 230. See Donald V. Cramer & Leonard Makowka, The Use ofXenografls in Experimental Transplantation, in HANDBOOK OF AMMAL MODELS IN TRANSPLANTATION RESEARCH 299 (Donald V. Cramer et al. eds., 1994). 23 1. The authors note that the greatest limit on the pool of organ recipients is the current shortage of organs. If availability of organs were to increase, then the number of transplants performed would also increase, as would the number of people who would benefit from the procedure. See id. 232. Chimpanzees are an endangered species, with approximately 100,000 left in the world. Their survival would be impossible if they were used as a source of organs. See LAMB, supra note 49, at 113. 233.

Indeed, timing is essential to a good outcome and an improved graft survival .236 Advanced planning of surgery improves the chance of the patient's overall better health at the time of the operation because of the shorter wait for an organ and the decreased progression of the patient's disease.237 The patient's better health at the time of surgery ultimately leaves him stronger during the recovery period.238 Xenotransplantation also allows a better size match between organs and recipients.239 Currently, difficulty exists in obtaining organs for small adults and children.24 Xenotransplantation offers a larger selection of organs from which to choose in matching donor organs with patients requiring them, and thus serves a broader spectrum of patients. People object to xenotransplantation on a number of ethical grounds. Some argue that God divided humans and animals and that man should not cross that barrier.24\"' A group of distinguished theologians disagreed with this religious argument when asked by the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine if Christian theology or Jewish law contains a prohibition against crossing species.242 This objection also fails when one considers that a number of medical procedures currently use animal \"parts\" as replacements for comparable human body parts-surgical sutures come from sheep intestines, cow bones and tendons replace human bones and tendons damaged in accidents, and heart valves from pigs replace human heart valves.243 Furthermore, the dramatically successful polio vaccine originates from monkey kidney cells.2\" Proponents of animal rights provide another argument against xenotransplantation. They argue that it is unethical to kill animals for human purposes and to use animals that are on the endangered species list as sources for organs.245 Those supporting xenotransplantation point out, however, that, while animals may have traits that entitle them to moral consideration and respect, treating them as equals in matters regarding human life and death 236.

In an article in the Journal of Medical Ethics, John Martin wrote that: Because of the clear distinction drawn between the nature of man and animals, if there is conflict between the well-being of one and the other then man's well- being must automatically come first. The application of such a philosophical approach to the problem of animal experimentation for medical need is helpful in a situation where emotions again give us opposing signals: a desire to cure... human disease and a desire not to harm animals. [This] approach clearlyjustifies that animal experimentation was done in the kindest way possible to help promote kindness towards man in the world. Reprinted in Arthur L.

The feasibility of human xenotransplantation should have been demonstrated before clinical trials by demonstrable success in an appropriate non-rodent animal xenograft model. 2. The clinical trials should be carried out: (a) by groups with a fully co-ordinated preclinical and clinical programme; (b) with local institutional and/or State or National Ethics Review Board approval; (c) with informed recipient consent. 3. The care and humane treatment of animals must always be of the highest standards. 4. All animal studies in transplantation must be approved by an institutional and/or State or National Ethics Review Board. 5. Endangered species must not be used. 6. Animals bred for the purpose of transplantation are the preferred source. 7. Research designed to diminish the need for use of animals in experimentation is to be encouraged.

Scientists foresee the publicity surrounding the success of xenotransplantation persuading the public that human organs are no longer needed.254 This may lead to a new shortage of transplantable organs.255 Scientists are apprehensive that a similar, though less catastrophic event, could occur. See Kress, supra note 28, at 365, 377. History provides several examples of diseases that have jumped the species barrier: the Ebola virus in Africa during the 1970s and the 1990s, the cercopithecine herpes virus I from macaques, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (\"mad cow disease\") in Great Britain, and the disease in Hong Kong that caused the country to slaughter millions of chickens.

Scientifically, rejection of animal organs by the human body presents the greatest obstacle to the success of xenotransplantation.\"5' Rejection involved in xenotransplantation takes two forms--concordant and discordant.\"7 Concordant rejection usually takes a number of days to occur and involves closely related species combinations such as baboons to man.\"' Discordant rejection, on the other hand, usually occurs within minutes following the procedure and involves distantly related species combinations such as pigs to man.259 The strategy for decreasing the rejection rates of discordant species involves genetically altering the species in order to make its organs more acceptable to the human body.6 The British biotechnology company, Imutran, claims that it can inject human genetic material into pig embryos so that the pig organs carry genetic codes similar to those of humans.6' By carrying the genetic code for human regulator proteins, the pig organs trick the human body into recognizing the xenotransplant as a human organ and avoid rejection of the organ.262 Xenotransplantation offers hope to many who may otherwise suffer the consequences of inadequate organ procurement legislation. While the technology for this procedure continues to develop at seemingly rapid rates, the legal aspects of xenotransplantation lag behind, due primarily to a quest for certainty of the unknown.

Discordant xenotransplantation offers the greatest hope for the future of organ transplantation. See id. at 449.

See id.[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. both recognize the possibility of xenotransplantation, but each takes a different approach to the actual implementation of clinical human xenotransplanation trials. A. Xenotransplantation in the United States Xenotransplantation in the United States enjoys a reemergence of sorts. During the 1960s and 1970s, doctors in this nation performed approximately twenty xenotransplanation procedures.26a The failure of these procedures,264 as well as the advent of renal dialysis, caused the transplant community to invoke a voluntary moratorium on xenotransplantation.265 However, the desperate need for organs, accompanied by the introduction of new immunosuppressants, led to the end of the moratorium in the 1980s.266 Some describe the United States' approach to xenotransplantation as 267aggressive. Unlike other nations, such as the United Kingdom, the United States moves forward with caution, evaluating the risks along the way.268 The Public Health Service Guideline, published in 1996, represents this permissive governmental attitude. This Guideline places the responsibility for the coordination of xenotransplantation, including clinical trials, in the hands of the already existing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC).269 Coupled with the 1999 Amendments to the Public Health Service Act, this Guideline forms a framework for the study and use of xenotransplantation in the United States. 263. In 1963 and 1964, doctors at Tulane University transplanted chimpanzee kidneys into six patients. See INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE, supra note 3, at 6. Twenty procedures, including experimental surgeries performed at the University of Pittsburgh, occurred in the United States by 1974. See id. 264. One of the patients receiving a chimpanzee kidney at Tulane University survived nine months after the procedure. See id. While the other grafts appeared to function normally, patients eventually died from graft rejection or infection resulting from large doses of immunosuppressive drugs. See id. 265. Other nations, including Sweden, China, and Hungary, proceeded to participate in xenotransplant trials during this time. See id. at 6-7. Even during the 1990s, when the United States and many European nations failed to engage in active clinical trials, several countries including Russia, China and other Eastern European nations, continued their efforts.

REv. 1. Public Health Service Draft Guideline on Xenotransplantation In an effort to minimize the spread of infectious disease from animals to organ recipients and the general public, the United States Public Health Service (USPHS) published a guideline270 in 1996271 that addresses the issue of public health risks associated with xenotransplantation.272 Inquiries from institutional review boards (IRBs) regarding the treatment of applications for the research and performance of xenotransplants prompted the development of the Guideline.273 The Public Health Service Draft Guideline on Xenotransplantation (Guideline) attempts to achieve the goal of minimizing the spread of infectious disease by xenotransplantation through provisions that range from detailing the function of the transplant team to creating a centralized database for long term safety data.274 270. The Guideline is non-binding, but is considered the minimum standard of care necessary in the performance of xenotransplantation. See Fredrickson, supra note 253, at 443. The decision to implement the Guideline rather than binding regulations exemplifies the FDA's policy of allowing greater flexibility to a developing industry while providing insight into the FDA's views. See id. 271. For a list of critical events leading to the publication of the Guideline see Food and Drug Administration, Fact Sheet on Xenotransplantation (visited Sept. 8, 1999) <http://www.fda.gov/opacom/backgrounders/xeno.html>. Just prior to the publication of these Guidelines, the Institute of Medicine published a report concluding that the benefits of xenotransplantation justified taking the risks of infection and calling for clinical trials to proceed. See Daar, supra note 255, at 980. The report also called for a national committee to coordinate xenotransplantation research and trials. See id. 272. See Daar, supra note 255, at 980. 273. See Fredrickson, supra note 253, at 433. The FDA was without the expertise to provide guidance on xenotransplantation so it sponsored a study on xenotransplantation, conducted by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), which ultimately resulted in the Guidelines. See id. The IOM, in its report to the FDA, made five recommendations to address the possibility of xenotransplantation clinical trials: I) the establishment of guidelines that address the screening ofdonor animals, surveillance of recipients and those close to them, creation of tissue banks for animal sources and recipients, and the creation of national registeries; 2) the requirement that all physicians and hospitals adhere to certain national guidelines; 3) that the ethical considerations involved in xenotransplanation be investigated; 4) that the bodies responsible for establishing the guidelines be coordinated; and 5) that xenotransplantation be permitted when scientific support exists. See id. at 433-434. These recommendations were substantially incorporated into the Guidelines. See id. at 434. 274. The Public Health Service document: 1. Outlines the composition and function of the xenotransplant team in order that appropriate technical expertise can be applied and that adequate data management, tissue storage, and surveillance procedures can be established. 2. Discusses aspects of the clinical protocol, clinical center and the informed consent relevant to public health concerns regarding infections associated with xenotransplantation. 3. Provides a framework for prctransplantation animal source screening to minimize the potential for cross-species transmission of known and unknown zoonotic agents. 4. Recommends approaches for postxenotransplantation surveillance to monitor for the potential transmission to the recipient and health care workers of infectious agents,[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. Under Section 2 of the Guideline, the transplant team involved in the xenotransplantation procedure must include, in addition to the transplant surgeons, individuals such as physicians specializing in infectious disease with experience in zoonoses,\" transplantation, and microbiology; veterinarians; transplant immunologists; hospital infection control specialists; and directors of clinical microbiology laboratories.6 All clinical centers involved in xenotransplantation must be associated with an accredited virology and microbiology laboratory whose Biosafety Committee, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, and Institutional Review Board review the protocol for xenotransplantation.2\" The protocol must detail the methods for screening for known infectious diseases and outline the steps taken in surveillance of the herd, as well as include a history of the source animals.27 Finally, those persons obtaining consent from the recipient should adhere to good clinical practices and ethical principles.279 including unlikely or previously unrecognized agents. 5. Recommends hospital infection control practices to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission of xenogeneic infectious agents. 6. Recommends the archiving of biologic samples, (including sera, plasma, leukocytes, and tissues), from the source animal and the transplant recipient for the potential investigation of infectious diseases arising from xenotransplantation which could impact upon the public health. 7. Recommends the creation of a centralized database. This database will address the need for long term safety data required for public health investigations.

The FDA has given its approval to some of these xenotransplantation protocols. One clinical trial that received a great deal of publicity involved the 1995 transplantation of a baboon's bone marrow into a patient suffering with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). See Daar, supra note 255, at 980-981.

The Guideline suggests that information provided to the organ recipient address the following points: I. The potential for infection from zoonotic agents known to be associated with the donor species. 2. The potential for transmission of unknown xenogeneic infectious agents to the recipient. The patient should be informed of the uncertainty regarding these risks, the possibility that infections with these agents may not be recognized for some time, and that the nature of clinical diseases that these agents may cause are unknown. 3. The potential risk for transmission of xenogeneic infectious agents to the recipient's2000] IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REV. Section 3 of the Guideline requires that animals used in xenotransplantation come from closed herds.2\"' It expressly forbids the use of wild and imported animals, and allows the use of captive free-ranging animals only when suitable for a given procedure.\"'i Section 3 also addresses issues regarding the record-keeping, the screening of animals for infectious disease, the qualifications for animals, and the archiving of animal medical records and specimens at the animal facility.\"' In Section 4, the Guideline addresses the clinical issues related to xenotransplantation. These include procedures for surveillance of the recipient following the transplantation procedure as well as for informing those closest to the recipient of the possibility of xenogeneic infections.283 The Guideline also explains the requirements of the hospital and the health- care team with regard to their ability to identify both known and unknown infectious diseases and to collect and store samples for investigation of possible infections.284 family or close contacts, especially sexual contacts. Close contacts are defined as household members and others with whom the recipient participates in activities that could result in exchanges of body fluids. The recipient should be informed that transmission of these agents may be minimized by the use of barriers during sexual intercourse and that infants, pregnant women, elderly, and chronically ill or immunosuppressed persons may be at increased risk for infection from zoonotic or opportunistic agents. 4. Any need for isolation procedures during hospitalization (including the estimated duration of such confinement), and any specialized precautions (e.g., dietary, travel) following hospital discharge. 5. The need to comply with long-term or potentially life-long surveillance necessitating routine physical evaluations with archiving of tissue and/or serum specimens. The schedule for clinical and laboratory monitoring should be provided to the extent possible. The patient should be informed that any serious or unexplained illness in themselves or their contacts should be reported to their physicians immediately. 6. The need for the subject to inform the investigator or his/her designee of any change in address or telephone number in order to maintain accurate data for long-term health surveillance. 7. Discussion with the patient regarding performance of a complete autopsy. Joint discussion with the recipient and his/her family concerning the need to conduct an autopsy is also encouraged in order to communicate the recipient's intent. 8. Access by the appropriate public health agencies to all medical records. To the extent permitted by applicable laws and/or regulations, the confidentiality of medical records will be maintained. 9. Consent forms should state clearly that xenograft recipients should never, subsequent to receiving the transplant, donate whole Blood, blood components, Source Plasma, Source Leukocytes, tissues, breast milk, ova, sperm, or any other body parts for use in humans.

One author supports the Guideline's efforts in handling the \"unique issues necessitated by the nature of xenotransplant research.\"'287 She believes that the Guideline, in requiring more information to be given to the patient, recognizes the significant risks involved in xenotransplantation and takes the appropriate steps to assure that the individuals involved are fully aware of their undertaking.288 The shortcoming of the Guideline in this area, however, rests in the lack of informed consent owed to those closest to the recipient.\"9 Some suggest that the present scheme ultimately puts the public at risk of infection because it leaves close contacts ignorant of the implications of xenotransplantation90 This area requires further reform so those closest to the xenotransplant recipient can protect themselves.29' A criticism of the Guideline addresses its efforts to control infectious disease. While the Guideline adequately speaks to the process of searching for and minimizing known infections, it lacks initiative when it comes to those diseases that are presently unknown.292 Change in this area should involve the development of clear illustrations of the methods used in the identification of unknown agents and further research into how to minimize the risks of infection.93 The Guideline provides an excellent starting point for the regulation of xenotransplantation in the United States.294 Efforts to learn more of xenotransplantation continue, however, and the law attempts to aid in these 285.

Congress's proposal for the 1999 Amendments to the Public Health Service Act indicates the government's commitment to increasing knowledge about xenotransplanation. 2. 1999 Amendments to the Public Health Service Act Members of the House of Representatives introduced HR 2418 on July 1, 1999.2\" Known as the \"Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Amendments of 1999\" (Amendments), this legislation amends the Public Health Service Act in an attempt \"to revise and extend programs relating to organ procurement and transplantation.\"'296 The primary feature of the proposed legislation is its creation of an Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network that establishes and operates a national matching system for donors and recipients, establishes and maintains lists of individuals in need of transplants, establishes medical criteria for allocating organs, establishes a twenty-four-hour phone and computer service to aid in organ matching, establishes standards for the acquisition and transportation of organs, prepares and distributes samples of blood sera from individuals having difficulty receiving organs because of their immune systems, and actively works to increase the supply of donated organs.97 Its efforts to increase the supply of organs include projects to increase transplantation among groups with special needs or limited access to transplantation and to study the impact of xenotransplantation.295 The Amendments have been heralded on three main points.299 First, they reinforce the original intent of NOTA by restating that the private sector 295. The bill was introduced by Rep. Bilirakis for himself, Rep. Green of Texas and Rep. Pallone. See H.R. 2418, 106th Cong. (1999). The history of the bill to date is as follows: July 1, 1999 Referred to the House Committee on Commerce July 21, 1999 Referred to the Subcommittee on Health and Environment Sept. 30, 1999 Subcommittee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held Forwarded by Subcommittee to Full Committee by Voice Vote Oct. 13, 1999 Committee Consideration and Mark-up Session Held Ordered to be Reported by Voice Vote Nov. 1, 1999 Placed on Union Calendar, Calendar No. 250 See Bill Summary & Status for the 106th Congress, H.R. 2418 id. 298. See id. 299. These points were discussed by Dr. William W. Payne, President of UNOS, liver transplant surgeon, and Director ofthe Liver Transplant Program at the University of Minnesota during his testimony before the House Commerce Committee Subcommittee on Health and the Environment on September 22, 1999. See UNOS News Bureau, UNOS President Testifies in Support of H.R. 2418 (visited 10/1/99) <http://www.unos.org/newsroom/archive-newsrelease _19990922_nota.htm>.[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. and the medical community should have the responsibility for developing, establishing, and maintaining the medical criteria and standards for organ procurement and transplantation.3\" Second, they provide new direction in the areas of enforcement, accountability, and patient confidentiality.3\"' Finally, the Amendments represent Congress' commitment to help the medical community increase the number of organs available for transplant.32 The Amendments' importance for xenotransplantation rests in the fact that they provide for the study of xenotransplantation at the local level,303 freeing it from the confines of inhibiting federal regulations.3\" As one author points out, regulations provide less flexibility as technology progresses and cannot easily be changed.305 The Amendments represent continuing efforts in the United States to make xenotransplantation a real possibility. Given the increasing need for life saving organs, the significance of these efforts cannot be underestimated. B. Xenotransplantation In the United Kingdom British lawmakers take a more conservative approach to the regulation of xenotransplantation than do their American counterparts.3\" Rachel Arrundale, a U.K. Department of Health official, described the British stance on xenotransplantation as one of \"no, but. ..,\" meaning that xenotransplantation may not proceed now, but will go forward once the government receives sufficient evidence of its safety.307 Currently, a moratorium exists in Britain that forbids clinical xenotransplantation.3s 300. See id. 301. See id. 302. See id. 303. The study of xenotransplantation will be conducted by groups established under and regulated by the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, which is a private entity. See H.R. 2418, 106th Cong. \u00a7 2 (1999). 304. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) recognizes that, while extensive regulations generally insure the equitable distribution of acquired organs, laws and regulations may also make the procurement of organs more difficult. See OECD, supra note 17, at 18. 305. Regulations must comply with notice-and-comment procedures when first established and whenever substantive changes need to be made. See Fredrickson, supra note 253, at 443. 306. The British stance on xenotransplantation rests in the \"precautionary principle.\" See Daar, supra note 255, at 980. This principle suggests that the government institute precautinary measures to avoid risks well ahead of any certainty about the natures of those risks, placing the burden of proof on those involved in developing the technology. See id. 307. See Kress, supra note 28, at 382. Dr. Amy P. Patterson, who chairs the FDA's Working Group on Xenotransplantation, alternately describes the United States position on xenotransplantation as one of \"yes, if... ,\" meaning that xenotransplantation may proceed in the United States if very strict rules are followed to insure safety. See id. at 381-82. 308. This moratorium began in January 1997, following the report of the British Department of Health's Advisory Group on the Ethics of Xenotransplantation. See id.2000] IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REv. Frank Dobson, U.K. Health Secretary, indicates that this moratorium will continue until he believes that the risks are acceptable.\" Xenotransplantation regulation in Britain rests in the recommendations\"10 of the Advisory Group on the Ethics of 309. See Warden, supra note 252, at 365. 310. These recommendations are made in ADVISORY GROUP ON THE ETHICS OF XENOTRANSPLANTATION: ANIMAL TISSUE INTO HuMANS (1996) and are referred to as the \"Kennedy Report.\" See Daar, supra note 255, at 979. The conclusions and recommendations made in the report include: I. Xenotransplantation is a valid supplement; if alternative found, will require reassessment. 2. Ethically acceptable to consider using pigs for xenotransplantation for currently envisaged procedures 3. Ethically acceptable to manipulate genes (limits exist) 4. Not ethically acceptable to use subhuman primates as source animals except for limited research (minimize) 5. Evidence overall is too limited to proceed to clinical trials; further research needed (i.e. effective embargo at present) 6. Risk of infection with fungi, parasites, bacteria, prions acceptable when control mechanisms in place 7. Not enough known about porcine viruses to proceed to clinical trials 8. Standard of animal care to be defined; mechanisms to be put in place; minimize harm 9. Sequential removal of organs unethical 10. When ready to proceed to therapy, national body needed to commission allocation of resources. 1I. Current allotransplant donation maybe affected by xenotransplantation; need public education; need efforts to increase donation and prevent organ failure in the first place. 12. No need to change to presumed consent (which remains unacceptable) at present for cadaveric organ retrieval 13. Xenotransplant clinical trials will become ethically acceptable when all conditions met; but conditions are necessary, not necessarily sufficient, and do not imply progression to therapy 14. National Standing Committee to be established to set standards, coordinate, assess, license, approve research, and decide when trials should start; when clinical trials allowed: a. Children and incapacitated not to be subjects of research b. Consent and legal and ethical issues extraordinarily complex, but current principles should apply; independent counsel provided for recipient c. Psychosocial effects to be monitored d. Conscientious objectors not to be penalized in the current organ allocation criteria and waiting lists 15. Train veterinary technicians, nurses now; allow them conscientious objection privilege 16. Hospitals for transplantation to be assessed now 17. Biosecure movement of tissue to be controlled, documented 18. Xenograft tissues to be brought under same regulatory controls as established for drugs and medical devices 19. If private sector to do xenotransplants: to come under same regulatory framework 20. International cooperation important 21. National standing committee to guide/work with local research ethics committees[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. Xenotransplantation (Advisory Group),3' a body responsible for reviewing the acceptability of xenotransplantation and studying the ethical framework in which it may be undertaken.\"2 The Advisory Group found it ethical to genetically alter pigs for use in xenotransplantation but warned against proceeding with clinical trials until the government established a National Standing Committee33 to supervise research, develop mechanisms to protect the public and patients, oversee the welfare of the animals, and determine when clinical trials should begin.334 The British government responded to the Advisory Group's recommendations by establishing the United Kingdom Xenotranplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA)35 to approve experiments and monitor progress in xenotransplantation until the recommended statutory regulation3.6 emerges.37 In addition, the government requested more information regarding the unacceptability of using subhuman primates and the conclusion that insufficient information existed about the immunological response, physiology and risk of zoonosis to proceed with clinical human trials.31 311. The Department of Health commissioned this Advisory Group which was chaired by Ian Kennedy, professor of medical law and ethics. See Marie Fox & Jean MeHale, Regulating Xenotransplantation, 147 NEw L.J., Jan. 31, 1997, at 139; Morris, supra note 252, at 242. 312. See id. The report of the Advisory Group mirrors the conservative attitude of the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, which published a similar report in 1996. See Daar, supra note 255, at 979. For more information regarding this report see NUFFIELD COUNCILON BIOETFICS, ANIMAL-To-HUMAN TRANSPLANTS: THE ETHICS OF XENOTRANSPLANTATION (1996). 313. Interestingly, the Advisory Group called for a committee to .regulate xenotransplanation in Britain, whereas the Institute of Medicine in the United States, in a similar report published in July 1996 called for a national committee to coordinate xenotransplanation. See Daar, supra note 255, at 980. 314. See Daar, supra note 255, at 980. 315. This group consisted of a chairman (Lord Habgood) and eight appointed members drawn from diverse disciplines who were also meant to represent the general public. See id. 316. The AdvisoryGroup recommended that this legislation include a provision allowing for the conscientious objection of health professionals who viewed xenotransplantation as unethical. See id. Under such a statute, these health professionals could opt out of participation in a xenotransplantation procedure without resulting prejudice to their careers. See Fox & McHale, supra note 311, at 139. Only two other statutes in Britain provide for conscientious objection by health professionals: Section 4 of the Abortion Act of 1967 and Section 38 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of 1990. See id. It appears that physicians in Britain may favor xenotransplantation. John Dark, who runs one of the United Kingdom's four heart transplant units, states that he sees \"'no ethical problems in breeding pigs and using their hearts. We already use about 1,500 pigs' valves a year in humans with heart valve disease.\"' See LAMB, supra note 49 at 112-113. Other surgeons at Columbia-Presbyterian have been conducting heart transplants from monkeys to baboons since 1984 and were ready to develop a program involving primate-to-human transplants by 1990. See id. at 113. 317. See Fox & McHale, supra note 311, at 139. 318. See Daar, supra note 255, at 980.2000) IND. INT'L & COMP. L. REv. The UKXLRA released its criteria for handling applications to proceed with xenotransplantation during the summer of 1998.' These guidelines require that the secretary of state grant approval prior to any treatments.20 The UKXLRA must consider any application made for clinical trials and may submit the proposal to other state bodies for approval prior to granting authorization.32 ' The attention of UKXIRA now focuses on establishing standards of tissue quality, as well as developing a system to monitor xenotransplant recipients.22 British biologists comprise one group that strongly supports xenotransplantation. In a response to the Advisory Group's recommendations, the Institute of Biology (IOB)323 issued a statement indicating its belief that xenotransplantation will eventually be required in order to meet the transplant demand.4 The IOB confirmed that the demand for organs in the United Kingdom continues to grow at a rate of five percent per year, and that a seemingly more effective system of organ procurement, such as presumed consent, would most likely fail to keep up with demand in the long run.325 The IOB also states that, while initial media attention may cause some degree of public scrutiny, the overall success of xenotransplantation will insure public acceptance of the procedure.326 Significant achievements in xenotransplantation were announced during the summer of 1999 that suggest that Britain's moratorium on xenotransplanation may soon end.327 Imutran released the results of its study of 160328 patients from eight countries who had been exposed to pig tissue 319. See Warden, supra note 252, at 365. 320. See id. 321. See id. Once submitted to UKXIRA, a team of approximately six referees will scrutinize each proposal then forward it to other state bodies as needed. See id. 322. See id. 323. The Institute of Biology acts as an independent and charitable body empowered by Royal Charter to represent biologists and biology in the United Kingdom. See Institute of Biology (1996) Response to the Advisory Group on the Ethics ofXenotransplantation, Made to the Department of Health (visited Oct. 1, 1999) <http://www.primex.co.uk/iob/dl3.html>. Individual membership in the Institute of Biology numbers approximately 15,000, with roughly 70 affiliated specialist biological societies participating as well. See id. 324. See id. 325. See id. The IOB attributes this continued increase in demand to the aging of the U.K. population. See id. It states that the increasing number of elderly in the nation require more organs than potential young donors can provide. See id. The increasing health and safety of Britain's younger population, from whom the most viable transplant materials are likely, act to decrease further the number of organs available for transplant. See id. 326. See id. 327. The media asserts that the findings of this study will bring an end to the moratorium on animal-to-human transplants. See Peter Gorner, Study: Transplants from Animals Hold Promise for People, NEws & OBSERVER, Aug. 21, 1999, at Al. 328. The study included 36 patients deemed high risk who were suffering from weakened immune systems. See id.[Vol. 10:2 ORGAN DONOR LAWS IN THE U.S. AND THE U.K. during the previous eight years.329 These results showed an absence of the pig virus \"Perv\" in all of the patients.330 Moreover, the studies indicated a potential survival of the pig cells inside the human body of at least eight years.33' These results offer hope that transgenic pig organs could overcome rejection by the human body and function for years.32 Government officials in Britain state that their policy regarding clinical human trials will change when they gather sufficient information to help them make knowledgeable decisions about the risks inherent in xenotransplantation. Perhaps the results of the Imutran study will provide the impetus for this change and bring an end to Britain's moratorium on xenotransplanation. VI. CONCLUSION Current legislation in both the United States and Britain proves inadequate to meet the demand of transplantable organs. Unfortunately, studies suggest that nothing can be done under the current systems of expressed consent and presumed consent that will ever provide enough organs.333 Therefore, medical specialists must look elsewhere for viable alternatives to organ transplantation, and legislators must keep pace with new technology by providing efficient regulations for the procurement and transplantation of these alternatives. The United States sets the pace for the regulation of xenografts in human clinical trials. Now that scientific studies dispel some of the fears that infectious disease will shift from pig tissue into the human recipients, Britain should end its moratorium on xenograft trials and focus Parliamentary efforts on relaxing the regulation of clinical human xenograft trials. Britain has concerns over its organ shortage problem, but changing to a system of presumed consent will provide minimal relief at best. The goal 329. See id. 330.

It is estimated that the maximum number of potential cadaveric donors per million population in the United Kingdom could never exceed fifty, regardless of the circumstances. See Jeremy R. Chapman & Bill New, Transplantation, in ORGAN AND TISSUE DONATION FOR TRANSPLANTATION 1, 8 (Jeremy R. Chapman et al. eds., 1997). As of 1995, the number of transplants performed per million population in the United Kingdom totaled 59 (28.9 kidneys, 11.3 liver, 5.6 heart, 0.9 heart/lung, 1.8 lung, and 0.5 pancreas).
