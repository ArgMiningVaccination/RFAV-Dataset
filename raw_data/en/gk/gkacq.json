Brought from Japan to the west in the 1940s, Reiki is now widely practiced around the world. Reiki is extremely low frequency (ELF) electro-magnetic energy. The signals recorded by scientific devices from the hands of practitioners are of frequencies known to stimulate healing effects on nerves, bones and other areas of the body. Reiki benefits people of all ages who are dealing with illness, stress or other imbalances. Whether you want to treat yourself, help friends/family members or start a professional practice, this one-day workshop will give you healing hands for a lifetime.

Are you struggling to create change in your life with ease? BECOME A CERTIFIED ACCESS BARS\u00ae PRACTITIONER! Access Bars\u00ae is a gentle hands-on modality that was introduced by Gary Douglas in the early 1990s. The bars connect at specific \"bars-points\" and correlate to different areas and aspects of life. Any limitations that you create in your life are connected to your thoughts, ideas, attitudes, decisions, and beliefs about it. Lightly touching the bars-points begins to clear away the electromagnetic energy that keeps you from believing you can have the life you've always known is possible. Access Bars\u00ae has assisted thousands of people to change many aspects of their body and their life including sleep, health and weight, money, sex and relationships, anxiety, stress and so much more. During an Access Bars\u00ae class you will gift and receive 2 sessions, and receive a manual that we will use to assist you in learning Access Bars\u00ae including the 32 bars points on the head, the proper hand positions, body processes, and other tools from Access Consciousness\u00ae.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2HWH9fG_40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2HWH9fG_40) Review of Access Bars\u00ae by Neuroscientist Dr. Jeffrey L. Fannin [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgGbFRjqQPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgGbFRjqQPk) The Effect of Access Bars\u00ae on Anxiety & Depression - with Dr. Dain Heer & Dr. Terrie Hope [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UjO-LC-RHs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UjO-LC-RHs) All of life comes to me with ease, joy and glory\u00ae Tibetan singing bowls are well known for their healing power through their vibration. By placing the bowls directly on the body, it is believed that this treatment will massage the cells through sound and vibration. It is a simple way to unwind, relax and perhaps understand yourself a little bit better. As a qualified Sound Therapist, I offer one to one sessions using therapy singing bowls, the treatment lasts for approximately one hour. Each session is designed to tune into your body's vibrations, generating sounds that will communicate with the cells throughout your body. Brain waves are one of the most important tools when it comes to healing the mind and body. Using Tibetan singing bowls help the brain achieve waves which will promote self-healing and harmony, which is often achieved after the first couple of sessions. The handmade bowls placed on the body create a symphony, a bath of vibrations and sounds that helps us experiment relaxation, joy and harmony after only one session. Healing processes are initiated through entraining our brainwaves to synchronise with the perfect resonance of the bowls. Unique tones create the perfect state for deep meditation, creative thinking and intuitive messages. The waves that ring from Tibetan Singing Bowls wake up our ability to hear with more than our ears. We feel the sound Tibetan Singing Bowls as much as we take it in with our ears. \"If we accept that sound is vibration and we know that vibration touches every part of our physical being, then we understand that sound is heard not only through our ears but through every cell in our bodies. One reason sound heals on a physical level is because it so deeply touches and transforms us on the emotional and spiritual planes. Sound can redress imbalances on every level of physiologic functioning and can play a positive role in the treatment of virtually any medical disorder.\" Dr. Mitchell Gaynor, director of Medical Oncology and Integrative Medicine, the Cornell Cancer Prevention Centre in New York Sound Healing expert, Di\u00e1ne Mandle states that Tibetan Singing Bowls don't only affect a great deal of physical healing but also have far-reaching implications that occur on emotional and spiritual levels. It is a regenerative process married to a spiritual awakening that can have profound consequences on illness, disease, and all aspects of our lives. In fact, mainstream medical teaching facilities like Duke University and the University of North Carolina have added programs that link body, mind and spirit to the treatment of cancer. Cancer prevention centres are utilising sound as a vital part of the healing process for patients with astounding results. Dr. Mitchell Gaynor has been using sound, including Tibetan Singing Bowls and chanting in work with cancer patients for many years. The medical director of the Deepak Chopra centre in California, Dr. David Simon, found that the sound from Tibetan Singing Bowls as well as chanting are chemically metabolised into 'endogenous opiates', that act on the body as internal painkillers and healing agents. Chakra balancing is used during the sound healing therapy to correct the chakra so that the endocrine gland and all the associated structures and organs effected by that gland balance and begin to function correctly. Historically, chakra balancing has been done in a number of ways but it has been most effectively done by someone who has the capability to either feel or see (or both) the chakras and their state of unbalance. They then use energy healing techniques to adjust and balance them. Tibetan Singing Bowls naturally cause chakras to self correct. The sound waves correct the frequencies of the unbalanced chakras, bringing them back closer to normal functioning. The trusted spiritual guidance on your journey to finding answers.

Do you ever feel that you are struggling under the weight of something that you can't quite put your finger on? Perhaps your life is not turning out how you wanted it to. You may wish that certain events in your past had never occurred. You may even have an uneasy feeling that your present is somehow being held hostage by your past in some vague and indefinable way. People often sense that they have emotional issues, but don't know how to get past them. The feelings that seem to be in their way are often due to their trapped emotions held in their subconscious mind. Your subconscious mind is aware of any trapped emotions that your body may be harboring, and it also knows exactly what effect these trapped emotions are having on your physical, emotional and mental wellbeing. All of these and more is locked away in the subconscious mind. The Emotion and Body Code accesses information from the subconscious mind using a form of simple and easily applied Kinesiology: muscle testing! People are usually amazed to find out that their emotional baggage often consists of discrete energies that became trapped during emotional events they experienced in their past. They are even more amazed to see how easily these energies can be found and removed and by how different they feel when they are freed from them. Trapped emotions can affect you physically just as much as they can mentally and emotionally. It is my experience that a significant percentage of physical illnesses, emotional difficulties and self-sabotage are actually caused by these unseen energies. The Emotion and Body Code can help you to heal: Everything can be a cause of trapped emotions in the subconscious mind or any other negative energy blocked in the body. By releasing these energies you can take your life back, enjoy better health and finally be free from the insidious and subtle forces that trapped emotions are exerting upon you! The sessions can be done in the comfort of your own home, in person, email or via internet or phone, All of us are dealing with something, We are struggling with some form of stress, unresolved feelings, past traumas, abusive relationships, and/or worries about the future, and it's sometimes difficult to do that on our own. V\u00e9ronique can help you to move past this, by helping you to \"take out the garbage\" and create the space for a beautiful life. For the past 15 years, Veronique has been a practicing Life Coach, Business Coach, and more importantly, a holistic practitioner. She constantly deepens her knowledge of different modalities such as Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), Matrix Reimprinting, Hypnotherapy, Neuro Linguistic Programming and ThetaHealing, and includes them in her Rapid Release & Reset sessions, depending on what is the most supportive for the clients and their challenges. V\u00e9ronique is committed to her clients becoming independent from her quickly, so she usually also teaches the techniques to her clients during the sessions. Some of her clients come to her with burn out, fears and phobia, childhood or relationship trauma, addictions, anxiety, or simply because they feel they have lost their enthusiasm for their current life. But the biggest hurdles her clients face are their beliefs about themselves and Veronique is passionate about helping them release what is holding them back from living a life full of joy, love and hope. One of her favorite moments is seeing her clients understand their values and strengths and move decisively in their lives towards the future, having released the pain from the past. Sessions are usually 90 minutes - they can also be combined with other treatments and activities such as goal setting. 3, 5 and 7 days one-on-one retreats are available upon enquiry. All programs are designed specifically to address the needs of the client (or couple) About V\u00e9ronique Ficheux : Originally from France, V\u00e9ronique moved to Asia 25 years ago.

Testimonials : \" I cannot recommend V\u00e9ronique highly enough as a therapist and life coach. I spent seven consecutive days with her in Bali, and I honestly consider it equivalent to 2-3 years of seeing a therapist once a week. Her ability to create a safe environment and guide me towards difficult issues enabled me to truly deal with personal traumas, some for the first time ever. She also equipped me with new tools, to include Emotional Freedom Technique tapping, that I can now use for self-therapy. I returned from Bali refreshed, energized, and equipped with important tools that have significantly improved my quality of life. My morning and evening routines and habits are healthier, I have a more positive outlook, and I have forgiven myself and others in a way that has created an incredible emotional freedom. The positive growth, especially in such a short period of time, has truly been life-changing... and in an enduring way, as I am writing this 5 weeks after my return. The change is real, it is lasting, and it is wonderful.\" Abi D., Washington DC \"Veronique was born to be a healer and empowerment coach! Her warmth and care immediately put me at ease and she is really good at pulling out all the threads of yarn to determine the route source of dis-ease to work through. I would whole heartedly recommend her to anyone looking to change negative thought processes. She taught me just how important our words can be, whether they're said out loud or in our heads. I'm looking forward to my next session with her!\" - Andrea, PR Executive, Singapore \"After meeting with V\u00e9ronique, I immediately felt her warmth, genuine care, concern and connection.

She has been practicing and teaching her own method of Holistic Transpersonal Hypnotherapy successfully in the Asia Pacific region for the past 21 years. She periodically runs Self- improvement Workshops and Hypnotherapy Practitioner Certification Training.

The amazing result out of this is that clients will understand \"Why\" they have their issues and are able to straight away overcome them permanently. She has successfully assisted thousands of clients to immediately and permanently overcome all sorts of concerns such as: She is happy to give free introductory presentation on self- improvement techniques for individual, groups or institutions The Javanese define life as \"nothing more than a pause on the path to drink a cup of tea\". Novi's approach to tarrot is influenced by her Javanese background in Sumarah philosophy. \"We start from the idea of our humanity, from the acceptance that we will never be perfect and that we will always make mistakes,\" she says. This is what gives Novi's readings such an encouraging and uplifiting character. According to her Javanese belief, since life is continuous movement and reality changes all the time, we have to learn to know and respect what is there for us and at the same time not to get too attached to it. Her belief does not offer solutions, it does not promise salvation, neither does it guarantee success. Her belief is mainly a way, an instrument of life, for life and in life, not an end in itself. Just like the meditation it is a tool that helps us arrive somewhere, but once we arrive, we eventually have to let go of the tool. With her gift she already serve almost 8000 people around the world to find their inner self to her tarot. \"That's the way she read Tarot\" Testimonial: Noviana is one of the most amazing women I've ever met. In the magical atmosphere of Ubud, Bali, she will tell you the truth about your life, fears and concerns. If you are ready to listen, of course. I was surprised, happy and I still can hear her words after two months. Because of her, I've started to dance, to have more confidence in myself and to understand that nothing is randomin this world.
