If there is no physical reason for infertility, try pure therapeutic essential oils to push the odds in your favour.", "sitename": "Absolute Essential", "date": "2022-09-08", "cleaned_text": "FOR ANYONE HAVING TROUBLE GETTING PREGNANT, THE FORAY INTO CAUSES OF INFERTILITY STARTS TO MAKE PREGNANCY LOOK INCREASINGLY MIRACULOUS. Contrary to what your mother might have told you, there are only about 60 days in an entire year when the average woman might be fertile - meaning about 16% of the time, tops. And of the 60 - 125 million sperm in one normal-sized, healthy ejaculation, only one sperm is expected to complete the journey - the chances of even that happening diminish with the presence of slow, deformed or diseased sperm. Other issues include women with 'hostile' uteri and hormone irregularities that fail to produce an egg to be fertilised. Overall, the information can be overwhelming and it might seem that everything is stacked against you before you even start. When there is no physical reason for infertility, pure therapeutic essential oils can push the odds in your favour The good news - for people trying to get pregnant - is that those fertile days tend to be the ones when libido is at its highest. That's nature's way of making sure that nature happens. Plus there are many miraculous tales of conception that confound medical expectations which supports the idea of stepping beyond conventional science to include a holistic approach. And since stress and hormone imbalance are the big issues linked to infertility, the pure organic essential oils with proven properties in these areas can definitely help to level the playing field. How essential oils can improve your chances of getting pregnant The plant hormones (phytohormones) in the essential oil can talk to our own endocrine system and help to stimulate healthy hormone production, that is, if the [essential oil](https://absoluteessential.com/collections/essential-oils) is extracted with great care and the molecules are fine enough. Other compounds in essential oils integrate with the nervous system and have been shown to help reduce anxiety and improve libido too. The 'fertility' essential oils are a tonic to body systems and some specifically to ovarian and uterine health.
