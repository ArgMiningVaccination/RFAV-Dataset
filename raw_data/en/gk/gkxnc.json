[Read More](https://www.mireproductivemedicine.com/insights-from-clinical-experience-in-treating-ivf-poor-responders/) Dr. Mersol-Barg just made sure we were as well informed as we could be about all treatment options, so we could make the best decision, which was IVF. We received more information in this one visit then we had after a year with our previous doctor. We couldn't be happier with our decision. We scheduled an IVF cycle and are now proud parents of our little miracle baby.

We couldn't have done this without your help, support and expertise. John and Rhonda "}
