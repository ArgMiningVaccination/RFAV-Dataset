The Living Crystal grants you maximum access to life force energy and a calming stillness that you can feel right away. The Vogel crystal amplifies energy for meditation. It works by connecting with the water in the body, increasing sensitivity to life force energy. A 9V battery powers a copper coil that creates a magnetic field around a Vogel crystal, creating a field effect and energizing the surrounding area. The top crystal affects the field and using a different crystal gives a different experience. An LED light illuminates the center of the crystal and provides a soothing white light. Each crystal possesses unique properties that can elevate your meditation practice, whether it's to promote relaxation, balance emotions, or to release negativity. Crystals are a natural companion to enhance your meditation journey and manifest positive energy. The Living Crystal, inspired by Marcel Vogel's research, is believed to be efficient to focus and direct energy for powerful and positive mental, emotional, and physical health effects through meditation and healing practices. The Living Crystal helps to promote focus and balance in life by magnifying energy and enabling deeper states of mindfulness. The Living Crystal provides an opportunity for release and freedom through its energy amplification and support for deeper states of relaxation. "}
