Peaking between December and February. Some years are worse than other years, in terms of number of people affected and the severity of the illness. A widely circulated theory on why influenza occurs in the colder months is once the temperature drops, we are prone to staying indoors which often places us in close quarters with others who may be carriers for certain contagions.

Cold and Flu Natural Remedies How Chiropractic Affects your Immune System One of the critical systems of the body is the lymphatic system. This is a network of organs, lymph nodes, lymph ducts and lymph vessels, that move lymph (clear/white fluid made of white blood cells and chyle) from tissues to the bloodstream. This system is a major and important part of the immune system; the lymph nodes of the body (people have between 501 and 700 lymph nodes) make immune cells to help fight infection. Lymph is transported throughout the body by the musculoskeletal system. To put it simply, it goes through the motions and contractions of the muscles. We also know through a study published in Nature in June of 2015, the central nervous system is connected to the lymphatic system. [Balanced Body Acupuncture & Chiropractic in Omaha, NE](https://www.balancedbodyomaha.com/) [Dr. Baker ](https://www.balancedbodyomaha.com/about-dr-baker/)always suggest that patients come in when they're feeling under the weather. There is significant research on the connection between the nervous system and the immune system. Specifically through the adrenal glands, the hormones and chemicals that relay messages from the nervous system to the cells of the immune system. Chiropractic adjustments remove subluxations, which prevent proper communication in the nervous system. By improving your brain and body connection, you are giving your body the best advantage against a cold or flu virus. A healthy spine is integral to a fully functioning nervous system. As I mentioned, the nervous system (sympathetic part of the autonomic nervous system) controls the regulation of the immune system. Thus, healthy spine = healthy nervous system = healthy immune system, and helps with your cold or flu. "}
