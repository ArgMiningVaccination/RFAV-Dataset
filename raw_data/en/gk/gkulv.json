Four infants died of complications after they were administered the vaccines at a primary health centre in Thiruvallur on Wednesday. The injectible measles vaccine, which provides 85% protection, is administered only once when a child is nine-months-old. Unsure about what might have caused the deaths, the health ministry rushed a two-member team of experts headed by Pawan Murti of India's National Polio Surveillance programme (NPSP) to the spot. Samples from various batches of the vaccine, procured by the Centre from HBI and allocated to Tamil Nadu for use in its routine immunization programme, have been sent to the Central Research Institute, Kasauli, for testing. Officials told TOI that they want to check the vaccine's efficacy and safety in order to ascertain whether the deaths occurred due to a break in the cold chain or because the vaccines were contaminated. Serum Institute in Pune has been India's staple supplier of measles vaccines. The ministry has been purchasing 350 lakh doses of the vaccine annually for its immunisation programme. However, in February, the ministry allowed HBI to supply 90 lakh doses because it cost around Rs 7 per dose in comparison to Serum's price of Rs 8 per dose and Rs 43 per vial (5 doses). An official said, \"According to protocol, a new company cannot be asked to supply more than 20% of the country's annual requirement for a particular vaccine initially. So HBI was asked to supply 90 lakh doses.\" He added, \"We know the adverse effects vaccines can have if not used properly. Cases of toxic shock syndrome have been common. However, we don't know what caused the deaths in Thiruvallur. Vaccine samples used there have been sent to Kasauli.\" According to experts, the measles vaccine can prove \"notorious\" and even \"fatal\" if not administered three hours after being prepared. \"The vaccine has to be administered within three hours of reconstitution. The vaccine comes in a freeze-dried form and has to be mixed with a fluid before administering. All through, it has to be kept in temperatures of 8-10 degree Celsius. If the procedure isn't followed, the vaccine can prove fatal,\" a ministry official said. Dr Bir Singh, professor of community medicine at AIIMS, however, said, \"There aren't reports of measles vaccine killing children because it went bad. At best, side effects have been reported and the vaccine has proved ineffective. However, vaccines which are exposed to heat or direct sunlight after reconstruction could cause anaphylactic reaction resulting in heart failure and respiratory trouble.\" Measles has been a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children below 5 years of age in India. Recently, India also held the dubious distinction of exporting the measles virus to Australia. Around 84 people in six Australian states were affected. According to India's Central Bureau of Health Intelligence, in 2005, an estimated 52,500 children were "}
