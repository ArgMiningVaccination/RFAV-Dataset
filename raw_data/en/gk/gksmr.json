These viruses cause diarrhea in pigs and cows and upper respiratory disease in chickens, while other symptoms may differ. In humans, a total of six coronaviruses have been identified HCoVs-NL63, HCoVs-OC43, HCoVs-229E, HCoVs-HKU1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV. The world health organization (WHO) has done a great deal of hard work regarding combating the monstrous effects of this virus. So far, no specific antiviral drugs have been developed for the treatment of Covid-19. Therefore, the medicinal plants used for the previous epidemic outbreaks are getting attention for their potential treatment against the virus. It has been reported that 70 to 80% of people in developing countries depend on medicinal plants or phytomedicine compared to allopathic drugs for their primary healthcare. The south Asian subcontinents have used almost up to 25,000 formulations and extracts obtained from medicinal plants for treatment in folk medicine. The present review discusses an overview of the coronavirus, its immune responses, and some immunity-boosting herbs to combat Covid-19.", "sitename": "Borneo Journal of Pharmacy -", "date": "2018-05-01", "cleaned_text": "Themes by Openjournaltheme.com Novelty OJS 3 Theme by openjournaltheme.com theme Quick jump to page content Main Navigation Main Content Sidebar Borneo Journal of Pharmacy Register Login Online ISSN : 2621-4814 Toggle navigation Home About About the Journal Abstracting and Indexing Publication Frequency Journal History Citedness in Scopus Citedness in Web of Science Article Statistics Journal Diversity Subscribers Sponsorship Journal Policy Aims and Scope Publication Ethics and Malpractice Statement Retraction, Withdrawal, and Correction (R-W-C) Policy Editorial Policies Peer-Review Policy Open Access Policy Licensing Policy Archiving Policy Plagiarism Policy Study Ethics and Ethical Clearance Policy Informed Consent Policy Conflict of Interest Policy People Editorial Board Acknowledgment for past Peer-Reviewers Publisher Contact Issue Current Archives Accepted Manuscripts Author Index Submit Article Submissions Author Guidelines Article Processing Charge Copyright Notice Privacy Statement Announcements Search "}
