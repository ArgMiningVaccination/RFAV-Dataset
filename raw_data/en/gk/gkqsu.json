[Rudolf Steiner Press](https://www.scribd.com/publisher/665949905/Rudolf-Steiner-Press) Reviews for Care for the Soul 0 ratings0 reviews Book preview Care for the Soul - Rudolf Steiner Introduction This anthology explores the nature of the soul as Rudolf Steiner elaborated it in his writings and lectures. However, it comprises more than an account of the psyche alone, and of soul life, and deals equally with the methodology for comprehending it, the scientific and above all spiritual-scientific means of doing so. The latter, according to Steiner, lead through the enhancement of active thinking to our own developing stages in meditation. This relates to modern mindfulness-based and usually Buddhist-oriented psychology and psychotherapy. Widely acknowledged disciplines in this field are the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) developed by Kabat-Zinn\u00b9 as group therapy; and the acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)\u00b2 used in one-to-one work, which in recent years has been incorporated into both out-patient and in-patient psychotherapy practice. The passages that follow aim to pick up on these schools and supplement them with spiritual science's key findings about the psyche as Steiner formulated them at the beginning of the twentieth century. They are fundamental for developing a method of enquiry based on meditation and the imaginative capacity, which can serve and support contemporary psychology and psychotherapy. In 1904 already, in the first edition of Steiner's 'Introduction to the Spiritual Processes in Human Life and the Cosmos'\u2014the subtitle of his book Theosophy\u2014he describes the soul as mediating between the body and spirit.\u00b3 In this picture, the body enables the soul to engage with the present moment, with temporal, transient things, by connecting it with sensory perceptions and thoughts, as well as with memory. In its activity, the soul is related at the same time also to the spirit and thus to futurity and the eternal. Thus the soul lives midway between body and spirit. The impressions it receives through the body are transient and exist only for as long as the body opens its sense organs to the outer world. My eye experiences the colour of the rose only as long as it is open and perceives it. The presence both of the external thing and of a bodily organ is necessary for an impression, a sensation or perception to arise. But what I have apprehended in the mind or spirit as the truth of the rose, does not fade. Nor is this truth in any way dependent on myself\u2014for it would remain true even if I had never encountered the rose. What I apprehend in the spirit is nontemporal or eternal. The soul is placed between the present moment and eternity and balances between body and spirit; and yet it also mediates the present and eternity to each other. It retains the present moment in memory. And by doing so it releases itself from transience and approaches the eternal realm of the spirit, at the same time also imprinting what is eternal into the transient course of time by giving itself up not only to fleeting sensations but itself shaping things, incorporating its own nature into them in the actions it initiates. Through memory, the soul retains its yesterday; through its actions it prepares its tomorrow. In several public lectures he gave between 1918 and 1920, Rudolf Steiner addresses how the soul is harnessed to time and how it mediates between past, present and future. We have included two of these lectures here (Bern, 9 December 1918, and Basel, 2 December 1920). But the volume begins with extracts from his written works that outline his method of enquiry. The first of these passages is taken from his book The Riddle of Man (1916). Here, engaging with German and Austrian Idealism, Steiner elaborates why, to be truly consistent, the scientific mode of thinking should actually deny the human being all capacity for sense perception. And yet, he says, we cannot regard the soul merely as a product of the body: in ordinary awareness it manifests only as a picture that originates in a supersensible world. Thus it is seen as an independent entity connected with the spirit, which we can experience by undertaking exercises at the imaginative level. The second chapter turns to forms of 'physical and spiritual dependency' to which we are subject, as Steiner outlined this in his book Riddles of the Soul, published in 1917. Based on previous research over thirty years, he connects here our tripartite soul capacities of thinking, feeling and will with the threefold nature of the body in, respectively, the neurosensory system, the rhythmic system, and the system of metabolism and limbs. In addition, Steiner assigns to soul activity three supersensible levels of cognition, those of Imagination, Inspiration and Intuition.* These comments by Steiner are fundamental for our understanding of both bodily and spiritual aspects of all soul life. Then follows the public lecture given in Bern, entitled 'Vindication of Anthroposophic Psychology', given on 9 December 1918. There he outlines the need for a 'new psychology' in our era, and for a capacity of enquiry developed on scientific foundations. Steiner here summarizes what he first elaborated in two lectures in Zurich on 8 and 10 October 1918, and again shortly afterwards in Basel, on 30 and 31 October 1918. In an article on 'Healing Disciplines', Wolf-Ulrich Kl\u00fcnker recently published a detailed evaluation of the importance of these Zurich lectures for contemporary psychology, and for enquiries into the nature of the soul. The Bern lecture, similarly, focuses on the limits faced by mainstream science in its study of human nature, both in an outward direction, in its capacity to comprehend the world, and inwards, in soul experience\u2014gestures which Steiner sees as foundational also for love and memory. Soul life is differentiated further into capacities of thinking, feeling and will, and correlated with the temporal dimensions of past, present and future. His observations here acquire great scope, addressing what happens when we fall asleep and wake up, and leading beyond earthly life into both pre-birth and post-mortem human existence. These accounts are followed in this volume by extracts from the public lecture on 'Anthroposophic Spiritual Science, its Findings and Scientific Validity', given on 2 December 1920 in Basel. Here Steiner takes up the theme of the Bern lecture and expands on it in relation to supersensible methods of enquiry, which, above all through the faculty of Imagination, can support anthroposophic psychology. This selection of texts concludes with the essay 'On Soul Life', which was first published in 1923 in the journal Das Goetheanum. This highlights the problems surrounding a purely scientifically-based form of psychology, as was clearly apparent at the time and is still experienced today. In contrast, Steiner proposes a path of wholesome soul development founded on anthroposophic schooling, with the development of Imagination, Inspiration and Intuition. Here he describes four stages in a sequence of development passing from the 'twilight of dream' to the 'brightness of spirit vision' and leading ultimately, 'on the path toward self-observation', to both 'soul courage and soul anxiety'. The book ends with a prospect of the field of psychotherapy, and its wider importance in relation to the life of society. Thus the volume traces key developments in Steiner's view of the soul as he sought to present this to a wider public in his books, lectures and essays. As he stressed in the Basel lecture, he greatly regretted that his public lectures met with so little interest from professionals in the field of psychology. This is partly also a reason for this new publication\u2014in the hope that professionals in the field will by now be ready to include these ideas in their discourse. With his fundamental thoughts and discoveries on the nature of the psyche, Rudolf Steiner pointed us toward a path that is still relevant today. Beyond this though, the development of Imagination, Inspiration and Intuition facilitates practical engagement with both social and therapeutic issues, and can offer much help and support in the field.

Methods of Anthroposophic Study of the Soul and Spirit Extracts from The Riddle of Man (1916) and Theosophy (1904) In science every subject requires a method of enquiry that is appropriate for it. But in studying the soul or psyche, in psychology, two possible modes of enquiry overlap, or even clash: science and spiritual science. Each may claim to be best fitted for the purpose, at least if, like Rudolf Steiner in the above-mentioned book Theosophy, we start from the premise that the soul stands in a mediating position between body and spirit, and exists within an autonomous phenomenal world. The approaches of these two kinds of knowledge and enquiry are usually regarded as mutually exclusive. One example of contemporary philosophical enquiry into the relationship between science and spiritual science can be found in Peter Bieri's Analytic Philosophy of the Mind in the form of what he calls the 'Trilemma'. Bieri's three theses, leading to the Trilemma are as follows: 1. Phenomena of the psyche or mind are non-physical phenomena; 2. Phenomena of the psyche (such as acts of will) can cause physical phenomena (bodily actions); and 3. The field of physical phenomena is causally complete and self-contained. Each of these three premises appears plausible at first glance. According to Bieri, the Trilemma involves the fact that every pair of the premises can be true but they cannot all be true at the same time. If mental phenomena can affect the physical world (premises 1 and 2), the latter cannot be self-contained (contradiction with premise 3). If on the other hand, the mental world is dependent on the physical world, and the physical world is causally complete (premises 1 and 3), then mental phenomena cannot act upon the physical world (contradiction with premise 2). If mental phenomena cause physical processes, and the physical world is causally complete and self-contained (premises 2 and 3), the mental must be reducible to the physical world (reductionism, contradiction with premise 1). In considering phenomena of consciousness as Bieri does, it becomes apparent that he does not refer explicitly to the spirit\u2014which lies hidden, as it usually does nowadays, behind the concept of 'mental phenomena'. Yet some of Bieri's ideas reveal that modern philosophy has not succeeded in logically interrelating the various phenomena of consciousness: physical and emotional experience, including mental (spiritual) phenomena. Rudolf Steiner highlighted an inter-phenomenal approach to knowledge, which we can describe as 'epistemological monism'. In his book The Riddle of Man, subtitled 'Explicit and Unarticulated Factors in the Thinking, Vision and Reflections of a Series of German and Austrian Figures', he summarizes the ways in which various philosophers, thinkers and poets thought in the context of the philosophical idealism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. He describes each of their positions, and its distinctive relationship to aspects of history and methodology. Thus he speaks of the Idealism of Johann Gottlieb Fichte as 'soul awakening', and that of Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, respectively, as outlooks founded on 'nature and spirit' and 'thought'. He follows this with accounts of the epistemological striving of less well-known figures: Karl Christian Planck, Henri Bergson, and Wilhelm Heinrich Preuss, whom he says represent a 'forgotten stream in German culture'; and of 'figures influential in Austrian thought', Fercher von Carneri, Joseph Mission and Robert Hamerling. In listing these thinkers, Rudolf Steiner is less concerned with the content of each one's specific thoughts than with the method of enquiry they employ. All those named start\u2014in a fundamental way at least\u2014from the idea of an autonomous soul life and its independence from the body, though each also justifies and develops their respective view in a different way. In his concluding chapter 'Prospects', large parts of which are reproduced in what follows, Steiner develops and enlarges these positions with considerations of epistemological methodology. Initially augmenting them with scientific outlooks based on Galileo "}
