Guilt. Here's how to overcome it](https://charlottenaturalwellness.com/2022/12/18/the-hidden-struggle-of-working-moms-guilt-heres-how-to-overcome-it/) What Our Wonderful Patients Have to Say When I came in to see Dr. Michelle I was very tired. I didn't feel like doing anything. Work was exhausting and made me aggravated. I did not feel well and I just didn't feel like I was living as well as I could be. In the last 2 months since seeing Dr. Michelle I have felt a lot better. My energy is better - I am not dragging like I was. I feel brighter and my attitude is better. Since coming to see Dr. Dillon I have lost about 9 lbs. without having to work at it. I am eating much better than before. My hair is not falling out any more I really enjoy Dr. Dillon's approach to health. I have been trying for three years to get my health back and I am happy to finally be getting results. "}
