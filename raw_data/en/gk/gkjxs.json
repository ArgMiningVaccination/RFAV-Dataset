The policy applies to all age-eligible passengers (currently 12 and older) and all crew, for ocean ships Crystal Serenity and Crystal Symphony and luxury expedition yacht Crystal Endeavor. Guests must be fully inoculated with a COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days prior to their embarkation date. [First announced in February 2021](https://www.travelweek.ca/news/crystal-to-require-proof-of-vaccination-from-all-guests/), Crystal was the first major cruise line to require a COVID-19 vaccine for both guests and crew, and now the first through 2022. Earlier this week, Crystal announced its [vaccination requirement for Crystal River Cruises](https://www.travelweek.ca/news/crystal-river-cruises-extends-vaccination-requirement-through-dec-2022/) has also been extended through December 2022. The company will assess whether a booster shot for all guests and crew across the full fleet will be required once more information is available. \"Protecting the health and safety of our guests and crew is paramount to everything we do and extending our vaccination requirements through 2022 is the next important step to continue to safeguard the health and wellness of our Crystal family,\" said Jack Anderson, president of Crystal. 'Our guests have overwhelmingly told us that vaccinations are critical for them to feel comfortable travelling and announcing this extension now will give them the information and reassurance they require as they look to plan future voyages with us.\" Guests will need to provide documented proof of vaccination at the time of check-in before boarding the ship. Children 11 and under who are not currently eligible for vaccination must be pre-approved after an initial waitlist, are subject to capacity control, and must provide proof of valid travel insurance. Guests travelling with unvaccinated children will be subject to unvaccinated protocols when with their children. Once vaccines are approved for age-eligible children, Crystal will require they be fully vaccinated. All officers and crew across the Crystal fleet are fully vaccinated at least 14 days prior to service as a requirement of their employment. The vaccine requirement complements the company's Crystal Clean+ measures, which include COVID-19 tests at embarkation for both guests and crew, temperature checks when returning from ashore, a mask policy, social distancing, enhanced cleaning and disinfection and more. Plus, all ships across the three brands feature 100% fresh, non-recirculated air in every guest suite, stateroom and social space. Crew across the fleet of ships must also wear masks in all public areas. For more information about Crystal Clean+, "}
